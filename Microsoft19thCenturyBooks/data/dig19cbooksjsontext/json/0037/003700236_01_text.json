NOT his earliest days, not his childhood and first youth in Australia, but his life when he came to England. He was the only child of a rich squatter and he was sent to the mother country, to receive a University education and be made a gentleman. Newton pere was the younger son of younger sons several times removed from the main line of his race \u2014 squires in Mountshire \u2014 it was understood he had some drops of good blood in his veins. Certainly he had the ambition to have his son so educated, that he might do honour to an Australian fortune, whether spent in Sydney or Melbourne or London or Paris. Young Harry had no objection in the world to being made a gentleman. He did not display the reluctance some unsophisticated youths betray to the refining process, which perhaps was a small proof that he was a ready-made gentleman, I"], [12, "A BUBBLE FORTUNE. 2 who had it in him to mount and assert his right to the highest step in the social ladder. But neither was this true of Harry, who, from first to last, had little self-assertion and was innocently and comfortably satisfied with a claim common to humanity. He neither looked up nor looked down; while he had no pretensions to be a full fledged philanthropist, demagogue, or missionary, he had an innate, ineradicable sense of the uni versal brotherhood of man, and an unconscious instinct to be all things to all men. He was choke-full of sympathy for everybody with whom he came in contact and he had no self-conscious ness to hinder its expression. He was a handsome child and a fine looking boy and lad. The open-air life, he had lived, had lent an ease and freedom to his movements \u2014 which the habitual slouch of the born Colonist, more accustomed to riding than to walking, from his babyhood \u2014 had not affected. He was thor oughly rustic while he was nearly absolutely free from vulgarity. Harry did not arrive in England in a state ot nature, where education was concerned. His father's dreams for him had included such a pre paration for keeping University terms, as the honest efforts of a stranded but not incapable University-man could effect. Harry was not at"], [13, "HARRY NEWTON'S EARLY DAYS. 3 all intellectual in the ordinary sense, or bookish in any sense, but he was at least tolerably famil iar with the A B C of learning. He was not in this respect behind the ruck of lads, who come to the Universities from private tutors, instead of from public schools. After the first wrench from home and his father \u2014 his mother had died in Harry's infancy \u2014 he enjoyed England and Oxford immensely. No doubt he felt sundry restrictions in not knowing himself or his father \u2014 which was much the same thing \u2014 monarch of all he surveyed \u2014 not on Sydney Harbour, but at Red Rock Falls, the Newton's station, where there was any amount of square miles of the Bush to roam in at will. But there were compensating advantages, and Harry had the adaptability of a woman in availing himself of them. He was possessed of a remarkable faculty of enjoyment, which served him from first to last; only crushing blows could destroy or even sensibly qualify it. A contented, cheery creature was Harry, with a passion for nature and for all nature's posses sions, especially in the animal and vegetable kingdoms, which was almost like an additional sense, an affinity and mutual understanding pecu liar to himself and them, between him and every plant that grew and animal that breathed. He"], [14, "A BUBBLE FORTUNE. 4 had a kind of mother wit, which expressed itself chiefly in kindly pleasantries, and a command of drolly imagined, grotesque comparisons and con trasts. It was a humour, as superficial and inef fective for serious results, as summer-lightning. Possibly for that very reason it recommended itself hugely to the duller, heavier witted ; tickled them as with a straw and convulsed them with ready, jovial laughter. \" The best of company\" young Newton was voted, when he was a freshman. He was highly popular, except in one light, with his gay compa nions. He was flush of money and free with it. He was their man, for all fun and frolic, though he could never be brought to have the devotion to cricket, (the great Australian team was not an institution of his day), foot-ball \u2014 not even to boating, so far as it was boat-racing \u2014 which he showed always for long walks \u2014 after he had taught himself to walk \u2014 for rides and rows in pursuit of some fish of the water, or fowl of the air, or plant of half wild common or marshland, which had taken his fancy. He might have stood for \"the scholar-gipsy\" with the important elements of scholarship and love of solitude left out. Harry had his popularity also with dons and professors, as well as with undergraduates. There was nothing undisciplined or indocile about him."], [15, "HARRY NEWTON'S EARLY DAYS. 5 He was loyal to ordained authority, to the inner most fibre of his being. He was the most obliging, unexacting fellow that ever lived, chary of giving trouble himself, unstinted in taking trouble for others. He was modestly and agreeably at his ease by that happy, half dignified, half obtuse complacency of his, at the table of his dean as at that of the head of his college, when they deigned to honour the undergraduate whom all men liked, as he was, alas ! at the shady board of some other undergraduate upon whom the world was turning its back. Doubtless the fact, that he was exceptionally handsome, contributed to Harry Newton's popu larity at this date. His figure was still spare and loosely jointed, when he was little over twenty, but it was impressive from his height and breadth of shoulder, and barring the slouch, which might have passed for \"the student's bend\", he carried it well, with the simple confidence of his character and antecedents. As for his face, it was very nearly perfect. It was one of those faces, which in its clear fine cutting, straight nose, delicately curved lips, softly rather than strongly rounded chin, one is apt to compare to a classic face, seen in an old cameo. In addition he had acquired an English freshness and purity of complexion. An eminent prelate lately deceased, was so favoured"], [16, "A BUBBLE FORTUNE. 6 in this respect, during his college days, that he won from his contemporaries the sobriquet of \" the peach.\" Harry Newton earned another title. In some lights, his face bore a likeness to that of the man in the world whom he least resembled in character \u2014 the great Napoleon \u2014 Harry's asso ciates in the exercise of undergraduate wit, taking lively count of the points of difference, no less than of similarity, called him \" Big Nap. \" In Harry's second year a grave obstacle to his worldly success became plainly discernible. He was not an individual addicted to such indoor games of chance as \" Nap \" or games of skill like billiards. It was not from a propensity to illicit betting, or undue ratting, or fox hunting, it was not from being \" gated \" and fined an unreasonable number of times, or from never opening a book or attending a lecture or passing an exam, that Harry Newton gradually grew to be regarded in a dubious and half-disgraced light, by his fellows and his official superiors. It was certainly not from anything worse, than might have been included in an excessive love of amusement and a lack of brilliant parts. His rectitude was never questioned. His standard of morality was at least as high as that of his neighbours, though it was not of the loftiest order, for the reason that he had the same difficulty, approaching to incapacity,"], [17, "HARRY NEWTON'S EARLY DAYS. 7 in distinguishing shades in morals, that he had in recognising grades in society. In either case his inveterate humility and his indulgent bonhomie disqualified him for right judgment. Harry's stumbling block, his rock of offence, was that he would not or could not see, where rank and privilege ended and plebeianism stepped in. He would not or could not fathom the gulf between Town and Gown. He was happy and at his ease with Gown, he was equally happy and at his ease with Town. He really could not comprehend the stern prohibition against such startling elasticity of principle and temperament. What could be done with a fellow, who in this fin du siecle would as lief pray with Kit Smart as with anybody? Nay, what was a hundred times worse than praying, which after all we are permitted to do in any company, Harry would as lief dine, tea and sup, walk arm in arm and shake hands affectionately with Kit Smart's equi valent, as with his vice-chancellor. Actually \" Nap \" would do his best to sing at a college concert the one night, and the next would exert himself to sing still better at some beastly tradespeople's affair in the Town Hall. He would put in an appearance at a Bampton lecture at St. Mary's in the morning, and in the evening be detected without a blush of shame, figuring as a unit in \" a horrid"], [18, "A BUBBLE FORTUNE. 8 low dissenting meeting-house.\" He would play tennis with la Creme de la Creme of Oxford girls in the jealously guarded sanctuary of a garden belonging to the Head of a House; and he would leave his companions, without compunc tion and with only the apology of another engage ment, to go and hunt for water-lilies with a bouncing, boisterous troop of town girls, who were simply nowhere in the matter of \"form.\" He had been seen, (tell it not in Gath!) in the Town Barge, instead of his College Barge, watching the \" Eights \" rowing for dear honour ; he had been seen standing unabashed on the deck of an ordinary steam launch, instead of a private house-boat, going with a set of obnoxious shop-people \u2014 utterly obnoxious out of their shops, where, to be sure, they were necessary enough \u2014 to witness the Henley Regatta. The humours of well-to-do citizens were appar ently as interesting to Harry Newton, as was the Attic talk of University Society. Yet he was no more a social reformer or a political radical, than the most conservative of dons could be proved guilty of such wild socialism. Harry was a radi cal because he did not see the line which divided gentle from simple, and loved them both as alike his friends and neighbours. \"Without question the young man's Colonial"], [19, "HARRY NEWTON'S EARLY DAYS. 9 extraction had something to do with his defective intuitions \u2014 rather than views. When he was at \" home \" as he still called Australia, not near any large town but up at Red Rock Falls, out in the bush he had fraternised with everybody as his father had done before him, station keepers, dig gers, stock-drivers, shepherds, had been among his chums. Thus it went without saying, if the keeper of a store had ranked as his father's oldest and most intimate friend and of course as Harry's friend also, out in the Colony, there would be neither sense nor reason, nor for that matter truth in his declining the acquaintance of those wor shipful shop-keepers in Oxford, who were ready to aspire to the distinction \u2014 a poor distinction. There were critics who said that Harry New ton's Colonial experience, in place of being an excuse, should have been a warning to him. He should have shrunk all the more sensitively from anything resembling the pit, from which he was drawn and the hole, whence he was dug. \" No, no\", these critics insisted, it was simply that he had a taste for low life. It was a great pity, of course, for he was a nice fellow otherwise, and was not in himself objectionable in his originality, but the fact could not be contradicted. There was this much to be said in agreement w-ith the last opinion, Harry was eccentric and his"], [20, "A BUBBLE FORTUNE. 10 eccentricity proceeded from what is commonly called \" a want \" in the man. From some dense ness of understanding or blurredness of percep tion or thick-skinned, easy minded indifference short of individual coarseness, Harry Newton did not know the right hand from the left where the finer shades of manners and morals were in question. He was worthy, oh very worthy in most respects, and in these not the least deserving of consideration. He was honest and manly, just and generous, but he was destitute in a general sense of fastidiousness with regard to the company he kept and the ways of his companions. He was too easily pleased, too tolerant of his neigh bours' shortcomings, even when they greatly exceeded his own, too intolerant w7ith a good humoured obstinacy, of any nicety of judgment and exclusiveness of behaviour towards his fellows whose code differed from his."], [21, "11 CHAPTER II. ANNIHILATED AND RESUSCITATED WTTH A NEW ENVIRONMENT. HARRY NEWTON was still at Oxford keeping his third year's terms. He was no longer hovering between Gown and Town, for such unbecoming vacillation is not to be borne in the most rigidly select of university centres. He had shared the fate of those who sit between stools, he had come to the ground. His popu larity with dons and undergraduates was, with a few exceptions, a thing of the past. He had not fared much better with the wealthier tradespeople, w-ho built fine houses on the outskirts and inhab ited them, carefully surrounding themselves with all which contributed to the lust of the flesh and the pride of life. If they still kept their sons behind the hereditary counter, because there was no place to speak of for them in college-halls, they sent their daughters to France and Germany"], [22, "A BUBBLE FORTUNE. 12 to acquire all the modern accomplishments to be had for money and enterprise. To tell the truth, Harry had no more discrimination here than else where. He was prepared to join forces and be hail-fellow-well-met with the man w-ho still lived above his shop, as well as with the man w-ho had retired to a villa, and if not satisfied with a villa had aimed at a country house. Naturally the man, w-ho dwelt in the villa or the country house and was tabooed even by unattached tutors, was dis gusted with Harry's laxity. Harry Newton was happy in spite of his censors whether of Gown or of Town. He had an innocent vanity of his own, but it was not of the craving, exacting kind which demands unmixed apprecia tion. For a man bred in the wilds he had still companions enough and to spare. In spite of his geniality he had \u2014 born of his antecedents and peculiarities \u2014 a certain tendency to isolation. He had after all some taste for lonely rambles, riding and rowing, where he was excellent society for himself, apart from an outer circle of friends, animate and inanimate, among thrushes and nightingales, tom-tits and king-fishers, sheep and oxen, weasels and water-rats, fritillaries and flower ing rushes, wild roses and honeysuckle, moon daisies and grass of Parnassus. For close cronies, he had his bay mare, \"Aunt Sally,\" and his"], [23, "ANNIHILATED AND RESUSCITATED. 13 fox-terrier \"Adam.\" The last was never absent from his master's heels out of quad. Harry's scout, alas! helped himself to his master's goods on all hands and so was not raised in the scale of humanity by that master's righteousness, but the one culprit loved the other culprit dearly. If Harry had stayed up long enough to go into lodgings, his landlady would probably have done the same in all respects. Many a child, in houses where Harry visited, and many a child, belonging to houses the thres holds of which his feet never crossed, many a shop-boy and railway porter felt Harry's charm and fell under his spell. And Harry himself was as happy as the day was long, taking his work easily, yet not w-ithout the prospect of lumbering along and getting his degree in time, taking his pleasures easily so as to taste them to the full and not exhaust them. Then the crash in Australia came; a tremen dous drought wrought such devastation among flocks and herds, as might have matched one of the calamities which overwhelmed the patriarch Job. But natural causes did not work all the mischief with the elder Newton's property, any more than with Job's possessions, a rascally stock-keeper, who had charge of the stock on a tract of land, as extensive as a moderate-sized"], [24, "A BUBBLE FORTUNE. 14 German principality, contrived to embezzle the proceeds and make off with them. Mr. Newton had rashly embarked in mining speculations of which he knew little or nothing, the failure of which meant ruin writ large to the share-holders. To complete the calamity the chief sufferer, already a man up in years, was stricken down by his reverses and died after a short illness. Harry heard it all in bewilderment and sorrow but not in revolt. His unassumingness and unselfishness had their natural complement of reverence. If before these evils befell him, he had been suddenly told that he was to die forth with, he would have been startled and more or less shocked, but presently he would have taken refuge in a resignation half manly, half meek. Thus he pulled himself together on this occasion and prepared to face the worst. He was young and strong, he had received a liberal education, though he had to own ruefully that he had not been able to make the most of it. But if every thing else fai1ed, he supposed his hands could keep his head, quite as well as another man's hands could do him the same service. Harry was no worse of, not even in the pain of the loss, which left him without a relation in the world, than were hundreds and thousands of his fellow ereatures \u2014 as good as he, Harry hastened to add."], [25, "ANNIHILATED AND RESUSCITATED. 15 To do human nature justice, Harry Newton was not left alone, to cope with misfortune. His tutor and dean and several more of his college au thorities, together w-ith half a score of men who were his contemporaries, came forward at the sharpest pinch to do what they could for him. A county lady of mature years, residing at some distance, journeyed expressly to Oxford to do what she might on his behalf. Lady Gosforth's interest in Harry Newton was not to be lightly set aside. Not so long before, she had had a son, an only child like Harry, who was in the same college, with rooms on the same stair. There were other bonds of union between the lads than propinquity and Harry's overflowing good fellowship. Poor Tom Gosforth was fre quently under a cloud. He had a perfect genius for getting into trouble, a good deal more repre hensible than Harry's social escapades, and yet not so very heinous or irretrievable for a harum scarum boy of nineteen. Harry at his own risk had stood by Tom and pulled him through more than one of his scrapes. When Nemesis came at last, in the shape of a coach accident in which Tom Gosforth received a fatal injury, Harry never left his friend till the afflicted mother came on the scene. Towards her he was so tender-hearted, considerate, unfailing in his kindness that she"], [26, "A BUBBLE FORTUNE. 16 could only say, choking down a sob, when the burden of her grief was heaviest, that he had been like a son to her. But though Lady Gosforth was a woman of some force of character and considerable energy, and though she had all the will in the world to be of use to Harry, it was after all one of his decried friends belonging to the Town party, who procured a berth for him, which he could fill at once, which would furnish him with bread and cheese when all the money to his account had been spent in paying his bills. This friend in need was a Mr. Bates, a respect able linen-draper in the High Street. Harry and he had managed to get acquainted in Harry's prosperous days and the elder man had extended to the younger a hospitality, which the lad accepted with unconscious intrepidity. Mr. Bates was a good old fellow, as good as another; what was Harry's knowledge of the dead languages or his delight in them, that he should throw stones at old Bates because he could not decline or construe the simplest passage in the classics? Why should Harry refuse to forgive Mr. Bates, because his h's were not ahvays to the front and with him r invariably stood for a ? Harry wished the fault finders could hear old Levett the store-keeper at home speak, with his inextricable confusion in"], [27, "ANNIHILATED AND RESUSCITATED. 17 the matter of singular and plural. Yet Levett was not only a man of substance with really a fine place near the Falls; he was held in general esteem, and his notions of the varieties produced by change of locality on bird and beast no less than on plant, were more to be depended upon than the notions of any other man in that part of the Colony. Mr. Bates returned Harry's liking with interest, and was proud of his friendship, with the inalien able respect of the Oxford tradesman for the College gentleman. The distrust and dislike bred of many centuries of strife have failed to extin guish the respect. The distrust and dislike could hardly extend to Harry Newton, nobody could know him and bear a grudge against him, though it was perfectly possible to undervalue and des pise him. Mr. Bates happened to have a son, who un like Harry, had social aspirations. To do him justice, he was not without higher motives, but even without them, he would have preferred to starve (metaphorically) as a curate rather than to grow rich as a shop-keeper. Harry had encoun tered the embryo curate in the College class rooms which are not absolutely closed to such as he. Harry had further come across young Bates in his (Harry's) fishing expeditions and 2"], [28, "18 A BUBBLE FORTUNE. botanical and ornithological rambles. With his usual disregard of consequences, he had struck up a warm friendship with the other youngster, though the two had little in common, beyond age and a slight similarity in a few pursuits. The elder Bates had an old acquintance, who Was in a fair position as a lawyer, in the thriv ing town of Foxchester. This professional man, named Coxe, had a vacancy for a clerk in his office, and on Mr. Bates' recommendation was willing to try Harry, pay him as much as he was worth, and give him the necessary clerkly training. Harry closed thankfully with the offer at once, and on second thoughts none of his friends could regret his determination. Even Lady Gosforth soon saw that not much more could have been done for a young fellow, who gravitated unmistakably to the lower middle class. He would probably not have consented to take orders, and if he had, his pulpit eloquence would have been as doubtful as his tact and dis cretion in a parish. Besides, where was he to get a parish in these days of much competition? How was he to be supported\u2014 he, who had been accustomed to wealth in some form \u2014 while he was qualifying himself for the Church, without grievous injury to his self-respect and independ ence? A commission in the Army? He must"], [29, "ANNIHILATED AND RESUSCITATED. 19 have been prepared for that also. He would have found more difficulty in living on his officer's pay than on his clerk's salary. He would have made ducks and drakes of military etiquette. Something in the diplomatic line? No, Lady Gosforth w-as forced to laugh when she thought of simple-minded, one-idea'd Harry in the character of a diplomate. A land-agent? The status was not much better than that of a country lawyer, to which Harry \u2014 though, at present, about as destitute of law as of diplomacy \u2014 might hope to rise. Harry, in spite of his rural tastes, knew nothing practically of land and agriculture apart from bush-farming. He had no acquaintance with accounts, with the exception of those which had to do with his personal expenses; these had not been hard to master, when money was plentiful and a fellow was not a spendthrift. He might have gone out as a Colonist to Australia, Southern Africa or America, but as he had not learnt to accept alms, and seemed to have no fancy for acquiring the accomplishment, he must have gone out penniless. Here, Harry's previous Colonial experiences stepped in, and told him that, at this date, his chances of success, as a penniless man who was not a skilled workman, were, on the whole, better in England than in Australia. Therefore, Harry agreed to Mr. Bates' proposal"], [30, "A BUBBLE FORTUNE. 20 and was presently settled as a clerk in Foxchester, with his dog \"Adam\" as the sole remnant of his flush of fortune and his University career. Knowing Harry Newton to be what he was, it need not have surprised anyone to find how rapidly he became acclimatized in Foxchester. The town, which had risen upon carpet weaving^ and was largely a manufacturing town, had no special attraction for him. Indeed, he liked sitting all day in an office considerably less than attending lectures and attempting to burn the midnight oil over ancient classics and philosophies. But Harry was a philosopher in his own person and he was also an honest young fellow, who put his shoulder to the wheel as well as he could, when it was required of him. If he had been landed and left on a desert island, he would have found something to occupy his faculties and awaken his curiosity and sympathy. Perhaps it would have been easier on a desert island than in a bustling, brand-new, self-engrossed manu facturing town, but it was possible in both cases. He despised no son of Adam \u2014 not of Adam his beloved fox-terrier, but Adam the universal pro genitor. Accordingly he was soon on excellent terms with his fellow-clerks \u2014 to whom he gave him self no airs; (the idea of Harry Newton giving him self airs!) \u2014 in whom he discovered, in the shortest"], [31, "ANNIHILATED AND RESUSCITATED. 21 space of time, any amount of admirable qualities, counterbalancing what was lacking in the clerks' minds and manners. When Harry found a man utterly repellant, which was a rare occurrence, he simply left him to himself and forgot all about him. There were so many people in the world, who were friendly and likeable, that it w-as not worth while to trouble himself with seeking to solve the problem of the few, who were hostile and objectionable. Harry was soon happy amidst his totally dif ferent surroundings in Foxchester. The thing, which tried him most and inspired him with the liveliest regret, was that he no longer had money wherewith to scatter debateable sunshine around him. He could minimize his own wants without any great personal discomfort, but not to retain the power of supplying the real or fancied wants of others, and of dispensing gratification to them, was truly a sensible mortification and genuine pain to him. Time passed without Harry Newton accom plishing any marvel of legal progress, but in the most hundrum commonplace manner grew worth more to Mr. Coxe than when Harry first entered the office in Foxchester. In course of years he rose several steps, by dint of seniority in age and superiority in culture, in union with general steadiness and trustworthiness."], [32, "A BUBBLE FORTUNE. 22 There he stopped short and was not likely to go any farther, but his easy-going mild-flavoured ambition was well enough satisfied. As senior and confidential clerk to Mr. Richard Coxe, Harry's income \u2014 counted, not by the fast receding past, but by recent experience \u2014 appeared sufficient for the reasonable requirements of one person. Nay, he grew to think it sufficient for more than one, when his annual visits to a home over which a woman presided, gradually impressed, even on his contented nature, a sense of his loneliness and led him to covet the domestic tie, for which he, more than most men, was eminently cut out. For Harry Newton was made to be a good, happy husband and father. With all his ready made patience and submission to the decrees of Providence, Harry had shrunk a little from going back to Oxford in his new role, just as he had shrunk from returning to Australia under totally different auspices from those under which he had quitted it, as the son of one of the most prosperous men on this side of the Great Continent lying in the lap of the Pacific. But Harry had kept up his friendly relations with the Bates', these being farther cemented by his gratitude for the timely intervention of Mr. Bates, at a critical period in the undergraduate's history. The younger Bates, with whom Harry had"], [33, "ANNIHILATED AND RESUSCITATED. 23 struck up an intimacy, had blossomed into the Reverend John and held a curacy in Somerset shire, where his sister Lucy was at the head of his modest establishment. Harry Newton had spent his annual fortnight's holidays in Somerset shire more than once, before the Reverend John took the important step of entering the holy state of matrimony with one of his parishioners, a lady who had a little private means. This embol dened his friend to follow his example, though the cases were not parallel. For Miss Lucy Bates was on the eve of being cut adrift, as it w-ere, and under the necessity of returning to the paternal roof, under which dwelt other daughters of the Bates' and she might by preference consent to share Harry's far from magnificent fortunes. As it happened, she saw them through the glamour through which all the Bates' household had originally beheld Harry Newton and everything connected with him. He had been somewhat of the young prince and hero to them; his social downfall had not alto gether extinguished this distinction, while it im parted to it a romantic strain. The Reverend John had never been able to convince his sisters, especially Lucy, that Harry Newton was only a so-so scholar, a young man whose abilities were of the most ordinary description, who was rather"], [34, "A BUBBLE FORTUNE. 24 thick-headed in fact, though he was a pleasant, amusing enough talker in his own light discursive way. He was a nice fellow, of course, a very nice fellow, but it was not in him to hold his own, far less to set the Thames on fire. Lucy Bates did not believe her brother on this subject; she was not convinced that Harry would never, by his unaided exertions, mount to a higher seat than that he had descended to, the office stool of a lawyer's clerk. It might not have made any great difference though she had been possessed of clearer sight, for she loved Harry, and she w7as warm-hearted and loyal enough to stand by lover and husband for richer, for poorer, for better, for worse. Anyhow, she married Harry with womanly pride and gladness and began house-keeping with him in a small house in Paradise Row, an economical suburb of Foxchester. Thus Harry Newton's destiny was settled. Those of his old College companions, who heard of his marriage, felt there was no way left for them, save that of dropping him entirely. Lady Gosforth was one of the few people who defended him; she said, she did not see how, with his nature, in his circumstances, he could have done otherwise, and she was not sure that he could have done better. She sent his wife a"], [35, "ANNIHILATED AND RESUSCITATED. 25 silver tea-set, as a wedding present. Her lady ship kept up an intermittent correspondence with Harry and was never in the neighbourhood of Foxchester without going to see him."], [36, "26 CHAPTER III. LIFE IN PARADISE ROW7. NANNY AND NELL NEWTON. IT was more than a quarter of a century since Harry Newton had ended his career at Oxford and it was twenty-one years since he had married Lucy Bates. She had died in the interval \u2014 not of cares and worries and narrow means, but of the seeds of consumption, which had lain for a time dormant in her constitution and been developed in the course of years. The same thing had happened with each of her sisters, not one of the Bates' girls had lived to reach middle age, though their brothers had successfully weathered the hereditary flaw. At the time of his wife's death, Harry had not shown himself more disconsolate than most widowers, on the contrary: he had struggled from the first, with sorrowful courage, to make the best of what was left to him. and to live out in manful fashion the"], [37, "LIFE IN PARADISE ROW. 27 life which had been shattered. But he had also shown how he had valued the wife he had lost, by remaining tenderly faithful to her. She had born him two daughters, who were his chief earthly concern \u2014 as he was theirs. He was still no more than head clerk to his first master, whose firm, of which Mr. Coxe had been sole representative to begin with, had progressed into that of Richard Coxe and Son. Harry still lived in the eight-roomed house in Paradise Row, to which he had taken his young wife, his gentle, enthusiastic, loving Lucy, as a bride. He would not have willingly left it for her sake, as it was, and though his youthful spareness had passed into portliness, Number 7 still afforded ample accommo dation for Harry, his pair of daughters, when they were at home, and the full blown maid-servant and half grown girl, who formed their staff of domestics. Happily for Harry, his dwelling house had a large garden attached to it, ground being still in not too great request at Foxchester, to deprive the natives of the amenities of gardens larger than pocket handkerchiefs \u2014 figuratively speaking. In that flourishing back settlement of his, the master of Number 7 spent the greater part of his leisure, from March to September. He had grown an eager, absorbed gardener, whose roses and cauliflowers meant much more"], [38, "A BUBBLE FORTUNE. 28 to him than was meant by his tables and chairs, his cheap cigars, even the timely replacing of his shabby overcoat. For his garden, he had renounced such dolce far niente as he had retained from his Oxford days. In connection with his garden he even waxed arrogant and exacting. The greatest rage, in which Harry Newton had ever been seen at Foxchester, was when his contributions to the local flower-show did not receive the attention, to which he considered they were entitled. To see Harry \u2014 as well bathed and brushed as ever \u2014 starting in the only tram-car of which Foxchester could boast, that at half past nine o'clock every morning ground its way past Paradise Row into the town and as far as Church Street, in which Richard Coxe and Son's offices were situated, was to see a respectable middle-class gentleman, who often looked as radiant as the fine specimen of \"La France\" or \"Devoniensis\", which he carried proudly in his button-hole. Anastasia or Nanny, and Nell Newton, Harry's daughters were girls of twenty and nineteen, the light of his eyes and the joy of his heart. There was very little alloy to the light and joy, for, being the man Harry was, the circumstance that it was the next thing to impossible that he could ever succeed in making a provision for his girls' future, troubled him but little. So far he had"], [39, "LIFE IN PARADISE ROW. 29 done his best for them, but, with all the will to do his utmost, it had been at the instigation of Lady Gosforth that that best had taken the prac tical shape it assumed. On one of her ladyship's visits, while the girls were still scarcely in their teens, and were running a little wild, as they began to outgrow the advantages of the old fashioned ladies' school in which they had hither to been pupils, she had said, with the privilege of old friendship, \" Harry, you must see to these girls. Every time, I see them, I find them grow ing bigger, or at least older. They will soon be beyond teaching. If they are to depend ulti mately on their own exertions, you must furnish them with available tools, in the shape of as suitable an education as you can procure for them. What do you say to sending them to Germany? They can learn excellent music and one foreign lan guage in perfection there. I know of a good school \u2014 not at all costly, as English Schools go \u2014 and I can lend you a little money for the pur pose, if you require it.\" Harry did not require it. He and his wife had been able to live within their income. His simple, inexpensive habits had not changed, and very soon Nanny had begun to show a capacity for managing his means and securing his comfort. Besides, their grandfather Bates had on his"], [40, "A BUBBLE FORTUNE. 30 deathbed bequeathed to the girls a few hundreds. a portion of which could not be better bestowed than in furnishing them, with what Lady Gosforth regarded as available tools for the business of life. It was a great wrench for Harry to part with the two mites \u2014 mites to him, however long-legged or prematurely wise they might be beginning to appear to the rest of the world. He had always been brave as well as patient, so he raised the companion ladder, let go the connecting rope and sent his daughters afloat on strange waters con senting to be parted from them for years, with the exception of the hilarious interludes of their summer holidays. Now, they had finished their schooling and had come home, for the present at least. Lady Gosforth had announced the first time she had the opporunity of putting them through their performances that she thought they did credit to their Dresden school. It was not their Dresden school, as Harry reminded himself with secret elation, which had made the girls two beauties. He himself had been eminently handsome at every period of his life down to his present stage of bountiful middle age, in which his fine features were neither pinched, nor coarsened, simply filled out in their classic outlines, and his dark hair was just frosted with"], [41, "LIFE IN PARADISE ROW. 31 silver. His wife, Lucy, had been very pretty in a fresh, soft and what may be supposed unaristo cratic style. Nell was like her on a larger scale, with the air and port of a young Madonna, which is something quite distinct from a young Juno. Nell was brown-eyed, and brown eye-lashed, softly rosy and dimpled, with an open forehead which no wavy down of fringe could rob of its candour, a white pillar of a throat and a figure still retaining its maidenly slenderness, in spite of the signs of the full curves and rounding outlines of greater maturity. Nanny resembled her father in face, she was darker and paler than Nell. Her clear yet delicately cut profile gave the same delusive impression of austere rigidity and inflexibility in repose, which had helped to win for Harry, the inappropriate nickname derived from the formidable \" little corporal.\" The comparison was not so wide of the mark where Nanny was concerned, not only was she a little woman, there were lights in her gray eyes, curves of her lips and lines about her chin which were lacking in her father's face. Handsome as it was and always would be, it had a lurking setness rather than heaviness, which showed more and more, Nanny was far from having her father's imperturbability; she would rise in defence of him and Nell, if Nanny fancied"], [42, "A BUBBLE FORTUNE. 32 them slighted or outraged, with a truly imperial wrath. While she was inches less in stature than her younger sister and was moulded with a dainty slightness, which demanded all Nanny's innate dignity to render it impressive, yet hers was a striking personality. People might call her \" Little Aliss Newton \" if they chose \u2014 the son and daughters of Mr. Coxe, her father's employer, always did so \u2014 but if she entered a room it was difficult, for ordinary people, not to feel small beside her, she was at once, without any effort or consciousness on her part, the central figure in it. She had a passion for justice \u2014 curious in a young and happy woman \u2014 which, almost outran the pitying tenderness of a strong, sound nature; she had a corresponding scorn, hard to repress, for all that was unfair, false and mean. Her moral fibre included those keen, often torturing perceptions and intuitions of what was abstractly right and wrong, noble and ignoble, generous and base in small details and in far extending circles, of which her father's nature was destitute \u2014 and seeing this obtuseness, together with what was good and true in him, her love for him was passing the love of ordinary daughters, taking as it did an element of the protecting, sheltering love which she bestowed on Nell. Now, Harry, if he had any preference w7here"], [43, "LIFE IN PARADISE ROW. 33 his girls were concerned, gave it to Nell \u2014the image of her mother \u2014 who was by no means without character, but it was a character which, like her mother's, had not been blessed or banned with magnifying glasses, and was capable of a considerable amount of honest, kindly, comfortable self-deception. This obligation on Nanny's part, of caring for her father and sister, had dated from the time of Harry Newton's having been left a widower, a view of the situation which had, from the first, characteristically hulked more largely in Nanny's mind, than the companion consideration of her and Nell's motherlessness. It is hardly necessary to say, that Nanny was the ruling spirit of the house no less than its nominal mistress. But it would be a great mis take to suppose that hers was a disturbing, stormy spirit. She was healthy in mind and body, with all the possibilities for enjoyment belonging to such an enviable constitution, which, after all, in spite of our physical defects, we can cultivate to a great extent if we will. There was no room for fretting in such a constitution. Nanny's spirit was moved impetuously, vehemently, at times, but it was not moved by trifling contradictions, especially in reference to herself; she was full of interests, and full of strength to cope with these interests. 3"], [44, "34 A BUBBLE FORTUNE. Judicious and beneficial as Lady Gosforth's advice had been, at a critical epoch in the girls' history, its acceptance had not been without its drawbacks. The Newton girls were a little out of place in Foxchester and at the same time it was their native town, which both of them would have hated to undervalue and hold up to ridicule. \" If there is one habit more horrid than another \u2014 I am sure you think so too, Nanny, \" said Nell's pleasant, well modulated voice, speaking to her sister, as the two girls strolled together up and down the privet-bordered walks of the summer garden, \" it is for girls to set themselves up as better than their neighbours \u2014 to go from home and come back and sneer at its old-fashioned ways, its provincialism, narrowness and the rest of it, nobody knows that better than I \u2014 but,\" with evident reluctance to go on, \" I do not care much for Letty and Milly Coxe and their brother. I remember, when we were little girls, I used to count it an honour to be invited to the Coxes and to think I enjoyed it ver)7 much, but I don't enjoy it now. I must say I do not find the Prings nicer, while Kate Coppock is the worst of all.\" This was a notable speech from Nell. As a rule, she did not stop short with declining to pick holes in her acquaintances' garments; if she"], [45, "LIFE IN PARADISE ROW. 35 had the smallest ground to go upon, she was prone to invest them in charming gossamer habil iments, the work of her active fancy, which was liable to end in pain and worry, when she was forced to disrobe her puppets. In place of com plaining of her geese as geese, Nell was wont to go on, as long as possible, reckoning them swans. \"I don't suppose any of these people care much for us, Nell, so we're quits,\" said Nanny, composedly. \" But it would have been so much jollier and better altogether, if they had been more companion able girls,\" said Nell, with wistful regret. \" I daresay, \" acknowledged Nanny, rather indif ferently. She had not the craving for companion ship with young people like herself, experienced by Nell, who was, if not enough for Nanny, at least a great deal to her, in the sense of a friend. \"I have no doubt the Coxes and the Prings and Kate Coppock think the same of us, \" resumed Nanny. \"Do you think so?\" asked Nell, wonderingly, as if a new light had been thrown on the ques tion, \" then it must be as much our fault as theirs. \" \" I don't think it is anybody's fault, \" said Nanny, dispassionately, \" it is simply that we and the other girls are not very congenial.\""], [46, "36 A BUBBLE FORTUNE. That was the truth. The Newtons and the other young people in Foxchester were not congenial. Nanny and Nell were exceptionally well educated, Lady Gosforth had not be^n at fault, in the school she had selected for them. But that was not nearly all. Whether from natural superiority of brains on Nanny's part, or superior ity in character on Nell's, or from some lingering flavour of gentler manners about Harry, whether from remote untraceable inheritance, the two Xewton girls stood apart from the other Foxchester girls in other respects than in those, which had to do with conventional accomplishments and the higher education of women, while naturally the aliens in the community were regarded with a certain amount of suspicion and distrust. It is not unusual for many attributes of good breeding, to be represented as confined largely to the higher classes of society, and not found far beyond the confines of Belgravia. In these fa voured regions, and in these alone, are to be sought well modulated voices, unstudied grace of attitude, judicious suppression of family traits and family confidences, the savoirfaire, and the indescribable community of interests and sympathies between people in the same high sphere. There is also, it is alleged, an air or tone, beyond all other airs and tones, as peculiar to the leaders in society"], [47, "LIFE IN PARADISE ROW. 37 and as significant of them as are their great houses and carriages, diamonds, &c. This air in women is illustrated by the exquisite, irreproachable fit of their gowns, by shoes and gloves which are miracles of elegance, by the prior acquaintance of the initiated with all the changes and caprices of fashion. One cannot help thinking that there is some special pleading here and a considerable amount of error. The air or tone may be given up with the irreproachably fitting, fashionably designed gowns, the gloves and shoes, without which the slender supple hands and feet would at once wax uncouth and awkward. Poor Marie Antoinette was wont to say that if she had not been a queen she would have been \" insolente.\" It may be that, to the unbiassed mind, those turns of the head and the white shoulders, raisings of the eyebrows and droppings of the eyelids, which are so enchanting to those biassed in their favour, are little better than insolence, audacity and superciliousness. Malice and cynicism, which have their irresistible attractions to those who are infected with the ma ladies, are not, let us hope, the distinguishing traits of the upper classes any more than sub serviency or brutality is inseparable from the lower ranks. Well modulated voices, even distinct artic ulation, where education has prevailed, simple,"], [48, "38 A BUBBLE FORTUNE. natural grace and dignity are to be heard of and seen in every station, just as kind hearts and good faith are not the private possession of either the high or the low. The stamp of an extensive fa miliarity with certain artificial, frivolous, often selfish modes of living, is not needed for the existence of qualities, which, like beauty itself, are the gifts of God rather than of man. Without question, the presence of innate and outward refinement is frequently to be detected in stranger quarters than the manufacturing cir cles of Foxchester. Nature's gentlemen and gentle women, in more or less adverse circumstances, are not pure myths. It may or it may not be that the portent points to an inevitable ascent in the social scale. Admittedly it raises a barrier between the recipients of the boon and those, who would otherwise have been their congenial associates."], [49, "39 CHAPTER IV. NANNY'S AND NELL'S DUTY. IT must be remembered that Nanny and Nell Newton were in an anomalous position. They were, after all, simply the daughters of an attorney's clerk and no other clerk's daughters in the town were \" far and away \" so well educated and so well looking, neither were they invested with similar privileges. It puzzled and annoyed the Coxes, Prings and Coppocks to account for this, it looked like an unwarrantable liberty, an abuse of \" favours received ? \" Why should \" little Miss Newton\" and her sister Nell appear to others, and probably feel to themselves, such superior articles of their kind, without overt arrogance and imper tinence on their part? They were only the daugh ters of Mr. Coxe's head clerk. True, there were some concessions which were easily accounted for. College educations were not common in Foxchester and though poor"], [50, "A BUBBLE FORTUNE. 40 Harry's erudition was limited, it had its appreci able weight. It constituted him a gentleman-clerk, a parallel institution to that of a lady-help. An other source of consideration was still more obvious and had greater influence. Lady Gosforth's con stant recognition of the family and interest in them, raised them in the eyes of the British Philistines; though her ladyship had not, as far as was known, invited the grown up girls to visit her on terms of equality. Nanny and Nell, though they would have been the last to set themselves up in opposition to their townswomen, could not help seeing that they themselves were different. They did not spend their time in house to house gossip, and general meddling and mischief-making like the Coxes. The Newtons were not engrossed with the changes of fashion, with brand new customs, new fads, new certificated polished slang like Ethel and Maude Pring. Nanny and Nell were not addicted to bare-faced, under-bred romping and flirting, like Kate Coppock, nor wholly given up to parish work and subjugation to the clergy of every shade of opinion and practice, like Kate's lame sister Lizzie. Each Newton girl did not so much gauge her neighbours by her own immunity from pettiness and advance in intelligence, as measure them by her sister's attributes. At the same time"], [51, "NANNY'S AND NELL'S DUTY. 41 Nanny at least saw Nell's faults as well as her graces. Nanny privately, thought Nell was as lovable as she was lovely. This did not keep Nanny from being afraid that Nell w-as a little fool ish, in borrowing, from the treasures of her own soft heart and kindly imagination, fictitious adorn ments for anybody she took a fancy for, and so being rendered liable, as her mother had been before her, to a succession of disillusions and dis appointments. Nell secretly, held Nanny to be a paragon of wisdom and cleverness and if she were a little sharp-sighted, matter-of-fact and obdurate, it was never to serve her own purposes, never in the way of failing her friends; for was not Nanny the most generous, the most faithful, and, under her seeming hardness, the most tender of women and girls? And was she not a real beauty? not a milkmaid beauty, or a fine lady beauty, but a beauty according to the highest standard? Both the girls agreed in admiring and being fond of their father, only Nell admired him all in all, and saw not a short-coming in him. Nanny admired what was admirable in him, but with her fondness was mingled the lurking ap prehension, the inexpressibly reverent pity ofthe gifted mother for the good son whom she has every reason to cherish, yet with regard to whom"], [52, "A BUBBLE FORTUNE. 42 she is sensible, in her inmost heart, that he has not attained to the highest manhood. \"Aren't father's manners perfect?\" Nell would exclaim delightedly, \"so far beyond Mr. Coxe's, for instance. He kept father standing ever so long, while Mr. Coxe was sitting and dictating business letters the other day. I saw them through the glass door of the inner office, when I was waiting outside to walk home with father. Why, he would not suffer a porter, not to say a washer-woman, to stand so long, while he talked at his ease. \" Father would not mind of course. That is the best way of meeting such treatment,\" answered Nanny, bending her straight brows a little, as she sat at her needlework in the shabby little drawing-room. It had hardly had a stick of furniture added to it, since Harry furnished it at a cheap rate to begin with, but it was kept scrupulously neat and bright. This was not done so much by the introduction of expensive, out of place nick-nacks, as by the unobtrusive but unmistakable evidence of careful use and cultivated taste, in the traces of the occupations and recreations of a pair of well-trained, well bred, womanly girls. There were one or two good engravings, relics of Harry's College rooms, but not representations of winning horses, prize"], [53, "NANNY'S AND NELLS DUTY. 43 dogs, or ballet girls. There were a few bits of inexpensive German wood-work and Meissen porcelain. There was an abundance of flowers from Harry's garden. The books were not con fined to circulating-library novels, though one of these was there also. There were Nanny's easel, and Nell's pile of music besides the cottage piano, which had been Lady Gosforth's gift to the girls in anticipation of their first holidays; because their mother's piano was too far gone to serve any other use, than that of an extra table in the dining-room. \" Of course, \" Nell continued the conversation, \" father understands. And don't you like to hear him talking to his old friend Lady Gosforth? He is so thoroughly himself \u2014 exactly as she is herself. There is not a word or a look to imply, that he is constantly remembering that he is 'a poor white-headed old fogey of a clerk' as he called himself laughing at me the other day, and that she is Lady Gosforth of Gosford Manor. They are just a man and woman who knew each other long ago, before we were born, and liked and respected each other both then and now, were ready to help each other whenever they could.\" \" What would you have? Father can always be trusted to behave like the gentleman he is, \""], [54, "A BUBBLE FORTUNE. 44 replied Nanny with pleasant dryness of humour. As she spoke she threw back her head with a smile, which betrayed the only fault in her beautiful mouth. It might have been amended in time, if she had been born a princess or even a dweller in Belgravia, as it was the small white teeth were irregular. The fault was lost on Nell, who, if she had been challenged with it, would have stood up for it, and vowed it was an additional beauty, simply because the teeth were Nanny's teeth. In spite of such perversity the Newtons were not a mutual admiration society in the sense of open or conscious flattery. Nell was sincere in her infatuation, which she kept to herself for the most part, since she had a strong inkling that its open expression would affront Nanny, who w7ould scout it unmercifully. Nanny was frequently calling Nell to order and finding fault with her affectionately, but quite in earnest. For Nell in spite of her super-excellent schooling was in clined to be careless, unmethodical, and unpunc tual. Nanny had often to quote for Nell's benefit Sir Walter Scott's opinion \u2014 an unusually severe one for him \u2014 that people, in the rank of life of his amanuenses, never rightly understood the value of time. Nell would waste her own and other people's time, and never get on in the world, if these foibles became inveterate. Nanny was not"], [55, "nanny's and nell's duty. 45 naturally more of a martinet than Nell was, but then Nanny fully realized the consequences of such failures. In her small heroic way, open to most of us, she strove to correct and overcome the tendency in her own person. At thismoment she was starting a subject, which was decidedly unpalatable to Nell, and proceed ing to deal with it in the most straightforward, unmincing style. \"Don't you think, Nell,\" said Nanny, \" while father owns to being ' a poor white headed old fogey of a clerk' it is high time for two big \u2014 no, big is a misnomer in my case\u2014 two full grown women to be bestirring themselves ?\u25a0 Is it not a shame for us, to live off his salary instead of doing something to supplement it?\" Nell looked taken aback, but she did not con tradict Nanny. \"I'll tell you what I should like for father,\" went on Nanny persuasively, \" I should like him to have a gardener's lad to help him, now that he feels the spring work among his vegetables and flowers too heavy for him.\" \" Couldn't we help him ? \" suggested Nell. \" We might, and we do when he will let us, but he gives us none of the heavy work and never will. And don't you think Nell, when his summer holidays come round, he ought to be able to go down to Somerset to Uncle John's Vicar-"], [56, "A BUBBLE FORTUNE. 46 age and fish and 'laze' for a couple of weeks? He would be ever so much the better for it. It would freshen him up immensely. He has not gone from home, for more than two nights, for five years, not since you and I went to Germany to school.\" Nell hung her head a little and spoke slowly in answer to Nanny's suggestion. \" I suppose father likes to take all the toil and trouble he takes with the garden, else he would not do it; and he says he does not care to go from home in summer time, because of the roses and peas and cauliflowers, nor later on in the year because of the plums and pears and marrows.\" \" Yes, father says so, \" remarked Nanny mean ingly, stitching without intermission at the cover of a sofa cushion of which there was need. \" And he would be so dreadfully dull without us, \" went on Nell with greater confidence. \" He told us, only the other night, what he never allowed at the time, how much he missed us when we were in Dresden. I am sure he would much rather have us at home than a gardener's lad, or than a run down into Somersetshire. You know Uncle John is always busy and pre-occupied, and Aunt Bates is out of health. The boys are either at Oxford, or away with reading parties; and the girls are as much engrossed with the"], [57, "nanny's and nell's duty. 47 parish and as unentertaining as Uncle John. Nobody has anything to say except about the Squire and his wife, the Sunday school teachers and the district-visitors. It is all quite right of course, but it is rather tiresome for visitors. It was you yourself, Nanny, who said so, the last time we were there, \" finished Nell reproachfully. \"I don't deny it, \" answered Nanny, with a gleam of amusement in her gray eyes, \" but do you imagine father is dependent for his entertain ment on his host and hostess, or on their sons and daughters, or even on the kind of neighbour hood or of trout-stream he has come to, or on the state of the weather ? \" \" No, \" Nell was forced to admit, \" father would get along with anybody, and be happy anywhere \u2014 even in a prison, like the man who watched his prison flower, still I don't think he really cares to leave Foxchester. Yesterday you were bent on his having a new summer suit, and he laughed and said he would not be made a dandy of, and that the old was better for taking his ease, doing his watering and catching his slugs in.\" \"He would do both \u2014 leave Foxchester and have a new suit to please us, \" said Nanny quickly. \" And he would miss us awfully, \" insisted Nell, with a pucker of her smooth forehead and the suspicion of a quiver of her soft lips."], [58, "48 A BUBBLE FORTUNE. \"So much, Nell,\" said Nanny emphatically \"that I could not find it in my heart, to suggest leaving him again to the tender mercies of Marianne the 'Marchioness', though Marianne is a worthy girl and would look after his bodily wants to the best of her ability, as her sister Sally did before her marriage, when we were away. One of us must keep house for father and be at his call, and I think it must be you, though you are the younger.\" \" Oh, thank you, Nanny \" said Nell huskily and stopped short there. \" I must confess, I cannot think of you as house keeper-in-chief, without a good many qualms. You forgot to order the dinner, on one of the days when I was staying with Uncle Frederick in Oxford last month, yet you succeeded in run ning up such a bill for the week that I had to put the whole family \u2014father and all \u2014 on short commons: a diet of lentil soup, shepherds pie and fried mackerel for the week following, in order to make the accounts square, \" Nanny shook her head and laughed half in jest, half in earnest. Nell took no notice of the impeachment, she was not touchy or vain in the matter of her amateur housekeeping. She was a good deal startled and a little frightened by the turn the conversation had taken, though it was not the first time Nanny had led it in this direction."], [59, "NANNY'S AND NELL'S DUTY. 49 \" And what will you do, Nanny ? \" she asked, with a shade of nervousness and hesitation. \" I have almost made up my mind, \" said Nanny composedly, but letting her work fall in her lap in order to give a more respectful air to her con versation with her sister. \" There is going to be a girls' High School started in the town, I have heard of it more than once lately. The Coxes were talking about it yesterday. The Committee is appointed and they have chosen an experienced head-mistress. I am thinking of applying for one of the other mistress-ships \u2014 either one for French and German, or one for drawing and painting. I believe I could venture to undertake either, and I have my certificates to back me up. If I got the post, there would be one great advantage and comfort, in addition to the salary, which is not to be despised, I could still stay at home. I could come back here every afternoon I mean, though I have been told the High School Mistresses are people of such importance, officially, that they are apt to go on committees of their own in the afternoon, and they have numbers of lessons to arrange, and piles of exercises to correct, so that they are very little good to their belongings when the mistresses are at home.\" Nanny smiled a little faintly at the consider ation. She was clever, but teaching was not her 4"], [60, "A BUBBLE FORTUNE. 50 forte and she was only in her twenty-first year. Nell's face fell till it looked absolutely doleful. \" It is good of you, \" she faltered, \" and brave, yes, brave, I could hardly do it, unless it were forced upon me, I know we were educated for something of the kind, I hear so much of the new careers opening up for women, but when it comes to the pinch, it is always teaching they have to fall back upon, so Lady Gosforth says, but she is of the old school and may be preju diced. Oh ! Nanny, it is so hard to think of having to spend our young days in bare dingy school-rooms with troops of dull and stupid or riotous and rebellious girls; if we do it, we shall not have an hour we can call our own until we are too worn-out to be fit for anything, save resting as if we were old women. We shall not be able to take a walk when the sun is shining. If we have a headache we cannot stop to cure it, we must just grin and bear it.\" \" Why not?\" asked Nanny in youthful severity, leaning back for a moment till her head rested against the window curtains; she did not mind the sunshine, which seized the opportunitv of flashing in, lighting up her clearly cut face, and shining into her gray eyes without, however, dazzling them. \" It is the discipline of life which we believe in, or profess to believe in.\""], [61, "NANNY-'S AND NELL'S DUTY 51 \" But there should be play as well as work, \" urged Nell. \"Bah!\" exclaimed Nanny in rousing derision. \" And there is no occasion for you to pile up the horrors. School-rooms need not be bare and dingy. I believe the High School Companies commonly build, what are called \" palatial \" insti tutions and furnish them with whatever is requi site according to the newest ideas. All school girls are not dull and stupid, or riotous and rebellious.

NEWTON-HAYES DROPS FROM THE SKIES. NEITHER Nanny nor Nell, as it happened, was fated to test the danger they ran of growing into strong-minded women \u2014 prone to rule rather than to charm. The very day after that, on which the girls had talked together on the subject, they went, as they had a custom of going, to intercept their father, on his return from his office, at an appointed corner of Church Street, and persuade him to take a walk with them, be fore he came back like Cincinnatus to his cab bages and his high tea \u2014 a refreshment unknown to the Roman patrician. Nanny and Nell had been successful in catching their prey and the three were proceeding, in great harmony, to make a detour round by the oldest church in the parish and by what had been the Village Green, before Foxchester took to weaving carpets and rose into a manufacturing town, when they were 51"], [65, "NEWTON-HAY'ES DROPS FROM THE SKIES. 55 stopped by Bertie Coxe. He was the \" Son \" in the firm, was in fact the lawyer's only grown-up son. He was a young man who had fulfilled his ar ticles, and- arrived at the respectable age of six and twenty. He had been hurrying after the group and was out of breath, when he reached them. \" How do you do, Miss Newton ? How are you, Miss Nell? I beg your pardon, Mr. Newton, will you come back to the office ? My father has something he wishes particularly to say to you. \" Bertie's manner was perfectly respectful, which was a wonder, since Young England in this case had not improved in manner over Old England. Indeed, if Harry Newton's daughters had taken umbrage at the lordly tone, assumed by the head of the firm to his clerk, they had been still more aggrieved by the free-and-easy dictatorialness indulged in by the junior partner, the \"Look sharp, w7ill you, Newton?\" \"Oh! I say have you not got through those letters yet ? \" Sandy-haired, prominent teethed, slap-dash Mr. Bertie was not a favourite with either of the girls, though he had shown himself willing to pay them patronizing attentions. But on this occasion his manner, though manifestly excited, was un exceptionable. \"Bless us! is my watch wrong?\" exclaimed Harry taken aback, drawing forth and looking"], [66, "56 A BUBBLE FORTUNE. critically at the guiltless face of his good old watch, a survival of the past. \" I thought it was five minutes past four \u2014 as it must have been by the time here, and my time keeper is not in the habit of playing me tricks \u2014 when I left the office, and that the work was pretty well cleared off; I am sorry if I over looked anything, which your father thinks of consequence, Mr. Bertie. I saw him coming along with a gentleman, whom I don't remember to have seen before, as I was going out. I fancied he was otherwise engaged, else I might have waited for him.\" \"Not at all,\" said Bertie hastily, \"I mean nothing of the kind you refer to. There has been nothing gone amiss in the day's work. It is a piece of news \u2014 unlooked for \u2014 at least as far as my father and I are concerned, which he wished to communicate to you.\" Bertie Coxe's usually cool, confident manner was still flurried though he was no longer out of breath; his tone retained the odd deferential inflection which it had not taken before, while the speaker looked curiously at his elderly clerk, iu a speculative instead of in a masterful fashion. \" Good news? \" suggested Harry, w-ith the cheer ful carelessness of the man who is down and need fear no fall."], [67, "NEWTON-HAYES DROPS FROM THE SKIES. 57 \" Certainly ; capital, splendid news for those who have to do with it. I wish I had the chance, \" declared Bertie, with what sounded uncalled for effusiveness. Harry had turned and was pre paring to retrace his steps, but he stopped for an instant to say. \" Girls, you need not lose your walk, and don't wait tea for me, if I happen to be detained, I'll come in for supper by and by.\" \" I beg your pardon, Mr. Newton , \" (Bertie had begged Harry's pardon twice that afternoon, and he had not done it before, since he was a forward little boy, who ran into the office between school hours, with messages from his mother to his father, and if he was not looked after played havock among the office pens and paper,) \"I think the Misses Newton had better accompany you, I believe \u2014 well, I am tolerably certain that they have an interest in what you are going to hear, and I should like to be the first to congratulate them as well as you, \" and Bertie slightly raised his hat with what he intended to be an insinuating bow. \" Bless us ! \" exclaimed Harry again, staring in a bewildered way at the young man, and then his slow mind leapt to the conclusion that old Coxe was going to raise his \u2014 Harry's \u2014 salary, though he did not know that his services were worth more than they had been years before \u2014"], [68, "58 A BUBBLE FORTUNE. say, the last time the agreeable operation was performed. It was rather a public way of doing the deed too ; but Coxe was doubtless the best judge on both counts, and while Harry had no objection in the world to being patted on the back and told he was worth his weight in gold, neither \u2014 he was convinced \u2014 had the two beauties, his daughters. They would have marched by his side as resolutely in order to stand by him, had he been going to punishment and disgrace, but of course it was far nicer to have their company, when his employers were about to bestow on him an additional testimony of their esteem and honour. The girls with their livelier ideas had already anticipated their father in his conclusion. Nell had gone a good deal farther. In her imagination her father \u2014 without preliminary study or exami nation \u2014 was about to be received into partnership with the Coxes, who were known to represent the most flourishing lawyers' firm in Foxchester; she was sure that, in the twinkling of an eye, he would be the most popular of the partners and the one in greatest request. Then of course there would be no further need of Nanny's seeking to take a mistress-ship in the High School. None of the Newtons made any attempt to pump Bertie Coxe, as, perhaps, he expected and"], [69, "NEWTON-HAYES DROPS FROM THE SKIES. 59 desired, while he was escorting them back to Church Street. Harry was of a quiescent turn of mind, the girls, though lively enough between themselves, were more reserved than sprightly in their bearing to the young men they came across, besides the distance was so short, that there was little time for temptation to assail anybody. In a very few minutes the party were at the office, where Bertie ushered the others through the outer office, which the junior as well as the senior clerks had vacated, into Mr. Coxe's private room. There he was standing on the hearth-rug with the very stranger Harry had seen in Mr. Coxe's company in the street, a quarter of an hour before. Spread out on the desk, before the head of the firm, was a pile of papers which Harry had not noticed, when he was last in the room. \" Glad Bertie has caught you up, Mr. Newton, \" said old Coxe who was habitually pompous and overbearing. He was pompous still, but, in lieu of his overbearingness, he was as gracious and polite as Bertie had been, while he hailed the clerk; and took in the unusual circumstance that he was attended to the office by his daughters. \" Ah ! the young ladies too, glad to see them also. Their presence is not de trop on this occasion, as the presence of ladies is apt to be"], [70, "A BUBBLE FORTUNE. 60 in men's dens, on the contrary it is opportune. Bertie I see you are bringing forward chairs for the Misses Newton, such humble accommodation as a plain place of business can afford they are most welcome to, most welcome if they will excuse its insufficiency. Mr. Newton allow me to introduce you to Mr. Westmacott, solicitor, Atherney;\" Mr. Coxe glanced at a card which he had taken up from his desk, and ended with a solemn bow. The name and profession of the stranger brought no further enlightenment to Harry than he had already gained, by a look in the direction of a somewhat formal and precise looking elderly gen tleman. The cut of his coat, the bow of his neck tie, especially his spectacled eyes fixed courteously but keenly on Harry Newton, betokened a pro fessional man, with every indication that the pro fession was one of peace, ostensibly. Ten chances to one the calling was that of a lawyer and not of a doctor, a clergyman or a civil engineer. Harry- bowed blandly, with his simple unaf fected dignity though he was utterly mystified. He had never heard the name of Westmacott before. He knew Atherney was a country town in one of the midland counties \u2014 Mountshire or Sparshire, but he was unable to conjecture, what either could have to do with any rise in his"], [71, "NEW-TON-HAYES DROPS FROM THE SKIES. 61 salary. Was it possible that this Mr. Westmacott, a lawyer in his own person, had heard wonderful tales of Harry's legal acuteness and trustworthi ness? Did he come to negotiate the transfer of the invaluable clerk from Mr. Coxe's service to his own? Harry laughed in his sleeve at the notion and shook his silvered head with a nearly imperceptible movement. It was Mr. Westmacott's turn to play his part in the drama. \" I am highly gratified to have the honour of making your acquaintance, Mr. Newton,\" he said bowing from a lower angle of the back-bone than Harry had thought it neces sary to descend to in his salutation, and speaking with old-fashioned, exaggerated ceremony which was yet perfectly serious. Harry had once seen the part of Christopher Sly played in a London theatre and he now re ceived the impression, that somehow, he was about to enact the role ofthe drunken befooled vagabond. \" Allow me to ask you, sir, \" Mr. Westmacott was proceeding to enquire in his respectful and judicial voice, \"if you have known anything ofa recently deceased namesake of yours, Mr. Newton of Newton-Hayes in Mountshire? Are you aware that there was any relationship between you?\" Harry at first said \" no \" , without any reserva tion, then cudgelling his memory he extracted"], [72, "62 A BUBBLE FORTUNE. from it an isolated fragment of information, \" I think I have heard my father speak of Newtons of Newton-Hayes. I believe, he considered we were sprung from the same old stock, far off connections in short.\" \"Exactly. Younever sought to verify your father's opinion ? \" suggested Mr. Westmacott bringing the tips of his fingers in gentlest proximity, while still looking searchingly at Harry. \"No,\" replied Harry, without taking back his word this time, \" I came from Australia a young fellow bound for a university, and when I left it I had no leisure for such investigations, indeed, I never troubled my head about them. I may say further, \" Harry went on out of the vein of humour, which was in him, \" the Newtons of Newton- Hayes, who had probably much more leisure than I, that is if there were such people, never laid claim to me as a kinsman.\" \" Will you be surprised to hear that you are supposed \u2014 remember, I say supposed not proved, though I have not much doubt in my own mind,\" proceeded Mr. Westmacott with cautious accuracy, \" you are supposed to be the nearest surviving relative of the late Jasper Newton, who died at Mentone in the spring of this year. He died intestate without leaving direct heirs. He married twice but had no children by either wife. He"], [73, "NEWTON-HAYES DROPS FROM THE SKIES. 63 survived his second wife, who had, of course, an interest in the property. He had younger brothers but the one was in the Navy and perished with the wreck of his ship \" The Lord High Admiral\" when he was still in his teens, and the other died a bachelor some time before the squire. The three brothers \u2014 there were no sisters, were the sons of a man who was an only child. Those lamentable breaks, failures in the line of succession, where our county families are concerned occur more frequently than anybody, who has not in vestigated the subject, would imagine,\" remarked Mr. Westmacott par parenthese, with a little measured wave of his hand, as if to set off a general reflection for the benefit of the listeners. Harry's eyes were opening almost as widely as were those of his daughter Nell, who sat next him. He betrayed some change of colour, but he an swered quite calmly and civilly, if a little bluntly : \" May I ask how you know all about the New tons of Newton-Hayes?\" \" Certainly, \" answered Mr. Westmacott promptly with another and a slighter bow, \" I have the honour to be the family lawyer, as my father was before me. Now, permit me to ask \u2014 was your father's name 'John Newton' like that of his father? and was he \u2014 your grandfather \u2014 a yeoman farmer at Radstock in Huntingdonshire?\""], [74, "64 A BUBBLE FORTUNE. \" My father's name was John Newton and I believe my grandfather was a yeoman-farmer either in Bedfordshire or Huntingdonshire.\" \" In Huntingdonshire, \" said Mr. Westmacott with an authoritative nod. \"Did any members of your father's family emigrate along with him? \" \" Yes, his wife, his nephew Miles, and Miles' wife \u2014 I can remember the last two, when I was a small chap, \" said Harry with more animation, \" he was nearly as old as my father. I have heard them say, his father was my grandfather's eldest child, while my father was his youngest, in a large family \u2014 the members of which nearly all died young, and that there was the difference of a score of years between the brothers.\" \" Can you tell me what became of your cousin Miles?\" \" He and his wife with their two children \u2014 I was fond of those kids though they were babies to me, and I was a big boy to them, \" broke off Harry meditatively, \" well, they parted company with us and went off to Adelaide, which was not a very old settlement in those days. You see. neither my father nor my cousin got on very well, during these first few years in the Colony. Miles thought he could do better for himself squatting elsewhere on newer ground. There was no quarrel to speak of, that I ever heard of,"], [75, "NEWTON-HAYES DROPS FROM THE SKIES. 65 a little dryness and difference that was all, but Miles Newton grew discontented and went off carrying his belongings along with him.\" \" Did you ever come across him again ? \u2014 Pardon me, Mr. Newton,\" broke off the lawyer with elaborate ceremony, \" I am speaking in your interest and I have a purpose to serve in putting these questions to you. They are necessary, inevitable in fact. They are not asked merely to gratify idle curiosity, I assure you.\" \" I should not think they were, \" said Harry with his easy genial smile, as he began to recover from the shock which had been administered to him. \" What interest could anybody have in cross-examining me, about relations of mine whom I have all but forgotten, poor souls, unless it were a matter of business? But, except that it sounds a waste of breath to talk so much of my insig nificant self, I have no objection in the world to tell anybody, who cares to hear, all I can recall of my humdrum antecedents. There is nothing to be either proud or ashamed of in them, since we none of us did more than make money and lose it, and we none of us went out at the country's expense. No, neither my father nor I ever came across poor Miles or his family again. I should have known him among a thousand, though I was a slip of a boy when I saw him 5"], [76, "66 A BUBBLE FORTUNE. last, for he was one of those short-bodied long legged men who are like nothing so much as a pair of tongs. His mind was not in proportion any more than his body, since he was one of those melancholy grumblers, who have always a laugh and a joke on the other side of their grumbling. There was no hope of our meeting again in this world, after the first news we heard of him, and that news did not reach us till many months had passed. Colonial posts, which were not bringing gold from the diggings, had not attained the clock work punctuality they were bound to reach. The bad news that did not travel fast was, that poor Miles and his little boys had fallen victims to typhoid fever, which had been raging in Adelaide. His wife survived him, and my father heard incidentally \u2014 years later, that she had married again and had gone with her second husband to Brisbane.\" \" Thank you, Mr. Newton, \" said Mr. Westma cott, leaning back against the chimney-piece of the fireless grate, unable, with all the traditional decorum and self-restraint he was bound to as sume to the man he was addressing, to hide an air of mingled self-importance and triumph. \" Your recollections agree at every point with the information it has been my duty to procure.

I have no hesitation in at once wishing you joy on your succession. \" \" I am much obliged to you, \" said Harry with equal urbanity, dashed with a soupcon of levity, \" I hope the game is worth the candle. I mean, \" he went on, unsubdued by Mr. Westmacott's dignified amazement, \" that in these bad times for agriculture, Newton-Hayes \u2014 you must remem ber that it has only just emerged from a haze where I am concerned \" \u2014 he perpetrated the small pun unblushingly \u2014 even to looking round for approval of the trivial witticism \u2014 \" may be a white elephant. \" \" Sir ! \" protested the family lawyer a little hot and offended, as he drew up his tall figure, \" we"], [78, "68 A BUBBLE FORTUNE. have had the management of the property for three generations.

Yet, in truth, the arrangements by which \u2014 after going home \u2014 he was presently to come back to Mr. Coxe's private room, which he hastened to put at the service of the squire elect and his lawyer (who had taken up his quarters at the Royal Arms Hotel), were made with commendable celerity.

I am sure Lady Gosforth will do all she can for us ; but she may not think a presentation at court necessary, especially as, though father has turned out to be of good family, dear mother, whom I can just remember kissing and crying over us when she knew she had to leave us, was nobody, only an Oxford tradesman's daughter.

'Little Miss Newton' will be able to assert herself at last, \" remarked the Coxes and the Prings, &c. &c. Then they hastened to come within the rays of the rising sun, and to oppress the girls with fluent congratulations and ample attentions. Mrs. Coxe had not thought it worth while to call on the girls before: she had considered that Milly's and Letty's occasional presence in Paradise Row was all that was called for in the light of a gracious recognition of the Newtons, on the part of the family of Mr. Newton's employer. Mrs. Coxe now arrived in state, to display marked friendliness in rejoicing with her neighbours who rejoiced, and in urging upon Nanny and Nell the advisability of making the Coxes' house the Newtons' home during the bustle and confusion of giving up the house in Paradise Row, and"], [84, "A BUBBLE FORTUNE. 74 probably having a sale on the premises before the family quitted Foxchester. Ethel and Maude Pring, who had happened to be staying in Mountshire six months before, hunted up, and brought to the Newtons, local guide-books, containing views of places of inter est which must be within not more than twelve or fifteen miles drive of Newton-Hayes. The Prings offered to write to their friends, who were twenty miles off, to ask them to see to anything the Newtons wished done on the spot. The Prings looked, and spoke generally, as if they were entitled, by superior knowledge, to act as prompters and guides in introducing the Newtons to a new region, while the informants counted on a due share of gratitude in return for their obliging services. \" You will travel by such and such a train to such and such a station, Nell ; Ethel or Papa will put it all down for you, Ethel has a perfect genius for Bradshaw; and mind, you must be careful to order a fly before hand, for I don't know that there is any cab stand at Atherney \u2014 As for Hayes, it is just a little wayside station, I believe, which may be very convenient for your visitors after you are settled in your house, but it is nothing to depend upon in the meantime.\" \" I don't think we shall need a fly, \" said Nell"], [85, "\"GOOD-BYE\" AND \"WELCOME.\" 75 with some spirit, \"Mr. Westmacott, the man of business, said that, though the last squire \u2014 our cousin in some way \u2014 had not stayed at Newton Hayes for a long time, the house had been kept up. It had either been let furnished, or remained in the care of old servants. The stables as well as the gardens, had been attended to, so that we shall find carriage-horses and the carriage waiting for us. \" Nell stopped short, the soft rose on her cheek deepening to scarlet. She had caught Nanny's eye, but she scarcely wanted that reminder to tell her how snobbish her speech might sound. That was a specimen of Foxchester's demon stration on the women's side; on the men's Harry all at once found himself unboundedly popular. He had difficulty in fighting off a public dinner and a presentation of plate \u2014 to him who had just come into possession of the Newton-Hayes plate chest ! \u2014 in token of his hitherto overlooked merits as a citizen of the town. In lieu of the public dinner and the presentation of plate, he had to consent to grace a succession of private banquets, from which Nanny and Nell begged themselves off, for the most part, on the plea of the accumu lation of domestic engagements, before the little household could be broken up and its members transported to fresh scenes. These demonstrations weighed on Nanny's mind"], [86, "76 A BUBBLE FORTUNE. and troubled it, if they did not vex anybody else. Harry met them half way and basked in their cordial spirit. Nell cried, with a break in her voice, that she had never known how good and kind people were, and she would never for get it. Harry Newton had been temperate in his habits, so far back as his Oxford days. Even at that comparatively early date the custom of giving and receiving \" wines \", and of indulging in half boyish, half mannish excesses and riots, had con siderably abated among the undergraduates. At Foxchester Harry had been a model pater familias ; but he had always been obtuse when the ques tion was of making distinctions \u2014 not merely with respect to the social rank but with regard also to the moral and mental calibre of his companions. He would walk and sit complacently, on the most intimate footing, with men who were his inferiors in every light, whose conduct he would not copy. He carried the injunction \" judge not \" to an un wise, unreasonable, well nigh immoral extent. The consequence was that he infallibly gravitated towards his inferiors. His associates were not, as a rule, fair representatives of the professional and manufacturing circles of Foxchester. This was a cause of anxiety and regret to his daughters. Not merely Nanny, but Nell, with her far less acute"], [87, "\"GOOD-BYE\" and \"welcome.\" 77 judgment and her multitude of excuses for those she loved, had not liked to see or hear of their father as forming one in the party made up by Mr. Pring, the sporting bank-manager, and Mayor Coppock, the somewhat rowdy carpet-weaver, to shoot crows, or pigeons, or wild ducks, according to the season. It was well known that Mr. Pring habitually took more intoxicating liquor than was good for him, until his family had got so accustomed to the weakness that they did not seem to mind it. Mr. Coppock was more prudent, and relegated his self-indulgence to convenient times and seasons. In other respects he made no bones of it, and would talk without hesitation and with a chuckle of \" going on the spree, \" \" taking a lark, \" \" having a break out \" on a fitting occasion. It is difficult to comprehend how a man, who had not been given to putting an enemy into his mouth to steal away his brains, could find any satisfaction \u2014 a satisfaction which had no self-interest at its root \u2014 in the company of others who did the reverse. Yet Harry Newton managed it patiently, com placently, with a sense of not more than half compunctious drollery and diversion in the process. It was his daughters who resented the association for Harry, though it was rarely, indeed, that his careless good fellowship went the length of flushing his cheek and thickening his voice. When the"], [88, "78 A BUBBLE FORTUNE. catastrophe happened it was Nanny and Nell who hung their heads, Harry looked a little awkward but not very penitent afterwards. Mr. Coxe had more regard for his reputation and position than to imperil them, in a manner not uncommon among respectable men of all ranks, two or three generations ago. He was decorous in all his ways. He was not wont to form one in those roving expeditions which Mr. Pring and Mayor Coppock started periodically. But it was the Newton girls' impression that the head of Coxe and Son had not treated their father handsomely while he was in Mr. Coxe's power. He had, along with his pomposity, a name for close-fistedness. They did not see any special reason why he should become so attached to his head clerk and devoted to his interests now that he was independent of the favour of an employer. It could hardly be said that Harry did not, for himself, see through the sudden change, and balance cause and effect rightly, but his universal tolerance came into play here also. It was natural for Coxe, poor chap, to be inclined to look after him \u2014 Harry \u2014 now that there was a chance of his figuring in the light of client instead of clerk, now that he was worth something and had Newton-Hayes tacked to his name.

No amount of insight, of his own or other people's, could keep Harry from relishing the honours and compliments which were showered upon him. As a small return, he lavished assur ances of kindred good will, and scattered invi tations broad cast, to Newton-Hayes. Nanny was too sensitive in her strength, had too fine a sense of what was due to her father, and too tender an affection for him, to dream of taking it upon her to interfere with what he chose to do; an interference which would have annoyed Harry not a little, and would have hurt him as much as anything could, while he pretended to laugh at it, and did not for a moment give in to it. But Nanny did not see why she should not seek to stop Nell, from being suddenly led to swear eternal friendship, after her father's example, to her acquaintances, and from endlessly begging them in the most pressing manner, to test the hospitality of Newton-Hayes. \"Why, Nanny,\" cried Nell, taken aback and annoyed, \"it is all we can do. It would be so odious to keep every good thing to ourselves, and not bid our former friends share it. We are"], [90, "80 A BUBBLE FORTUNE. not going to be ashamed of our past, there is nothing to be ashamed of, \" protested Nell, quite resentfully, \" we are not going to forget old faces. I never expected to hear you make such a suggestion.\" \" No, Nell, we are not going to be ashamed ofthe past, not even of having thought of being a High- School Mistress,\" replied Nanny, with a twinkle of her gray eyes. \" But we need not let our selves be run away with by the mood of the mo ment, kindly as the mood may be; we are not going to persuade ourselves and other people that we were much fonder of the girls here than we ever were, as you must remember, if you will think of it. We are not going to forget old faces or to refuse to be pleased to see them again ; but we are not going to rush into the arms of all and sundry here, and engage to keep open house for them. Because, dear, the rushing would be mere passing excitement and emotion, it would not be genuine feeling. Besides, I'm almost sure the open house would lead to trying complications.\" Nell did not look convinced, she appeared for the moment to think Nanny a dreadfully cold blooded individual. \" Of course, I shall not do anything you do not wish,\" she said a little stiffly, as if she were feeling a trifle snubbed. \" You are the elder and you must be the mistress of Newton-Hayes. \""], [91, "\"GOOD-BYE\" AND \"WELCOME.\" 81 \" Nonsense ! \" said Nanny, with a little asperity, \"as if there could be a question of who should be the mistress of father's house, between us, Nell! No, I want you to see for yourself. Shall you like to see Mr. Pring, with his bleared eyes and copper coloured nose, and Mayor Coppock, with his jokes about our getting husbands, coming on a visit to Newton-Hayes ? Do you think they will be in keeping with the place and the people there, as we hope to find them? \" \" That is different, \" said Nell quickly. \" Not very, \" maintained Nanny. \" I don't mean to be carping and critical, but you know we never cared very much for Milly and Letty Coxe, nor the Pring girls, nor Kate Coppock ; we never agreed particularly well with them, why should we begin to fancy we shall now ? There are several of our old companions in Dresden to whom there need not be the smallest objection. For that matter, I have no doubt there are unexception able people in Foxchester, such as the Halls and the Bannisters, only father does not happen to know many of them, and of the nicest he knows and we know, they are the very people we can't have, because they are somehow fixtures here.

There is Mary Myer, but she has the parish, as well as her old uncle, on her shoulders since the vicar's wife died. And there are mother's kind friends, the three Misses Cray, who have grown to think themselves too old to go from home, unless in a case of need \u2014 to be of use to some of their innumerable nephews and grand nephews and their families.\" Thoughtful as Nanny was, her warning was not entirely due to her own deductions. Lady Gosforth had written, rejoicing in her old friend's good fortune and giving his elder daughter some excellent advice. \" I have no wish to make you heartless, \" the monitor wrote, \" but I must caution you. Your first step in a new world may make or mar your future. It is of the greatest conse quence that you should keep yourselves free, and try to giveea good impression to begin with. You owe it to yourselves, you girls, and to your father. Don't hang mill-stones round your necks, it will do no good to other people, while it may be fatal to you, for you will want all that is in your favour on your own account. Be sure that you are off reasonably with 'the old love' Foxchester, to which I think you were not excessively attached, before"], [93, "\"GOOD-BYE\" AND \"WELCOME.\" 83 you are on with 'the new' Newton-Hayes, where I hope and trust you will take root and prosper. Above all things, avoid undesirable complications.\" It was on a hot slumberous July afternoon that the Newtons arrived at the nearest railway station where Newton-Hayes was in question. Travelling was very fatiguing in such weather. The whole party had undergone a good deal of mental strain lately. They were literally trem bling with expectation; even Harry was moved. If Mr. Westmacott had not had the sense to defer implicitly to their wishes, as to keeping their arrival a secret known only to himself and the servants at the house, and if he had not put down his foot imperatively on every suggestion of a tenants' demonstration, it is hard to say what might not have happened. The Newtons' manners had not been trained to the conventional repose which stamps the caste of Vere de Vere. But there was only the comfortable commonplace, somewhat shabby old carriage and its fat horses, which looked, nevertheless, to the travellers' dazzled eyes, very like Cinderella's transformed pumpkin, awaiting them, and Harry and his daughters drove, as in a dream, along a pretty country road, over the long shadows cast by the way-side elms and beeches, across the dusty high-way. The carriage and its occupants presently turned"], [94, "84 A BUBBLE FORTUNE. in at an open gateway, guarded by an antiquated Swiss cottage, and drove up a lime tree avenue, with the limes already causing a light yellow litter, on the red gravel, by their fast dropping seed-leaves, and came in sight of the house. It was not a Norman Castle nor an Elizabethan Manor-house, it was Jacobean in date, with long French windows and a portico rather too big for the size of the house. It opened on a tolerably extensive lawn, dotted with well-grown conifers, and sloping down to a mossy paling, which divided it from a wooded undulating park, full of lights and shadows. It was all very different from Paradise Row. Harry stepped down, a little shakily, handed out his daughters, and proceeded to mount with them the flight of steps to the hall door. It stood open and within were ranged the servants, partly engaged by Mr. Westmacott, and partlv sent down from London by Lady Gosforth. Thev were, no doubt, as curious to see and form an opinion on their future master and mistresses as these were to make the acquaintance of the household to which they had come. It was a trying moment for both. As Nanny glanced at Nell, trembling and ready to sink under the burden of honour and novelty, and at her father bland, yet vacillating between old associations with"], [95, "\"GOOD-BYE\" AND \"WELCOME.\" 85 Oxford times, and the experience of the last quarter of a century, there flashed across the elder sister's mind what Lady Gosforth had writ ten of the importance of a first impression. The Newtons had come to rule there, and it was not enough for them to show their subjects a hand some, portly gentleman with two daughters fair enough to see. Somebody must take the initia tive, somebody must exhibit himself or herself equal to the occasion. Nanny took in the servants at a glance, and picked out the bowing and becking housekeeper. It was necessary for the girl to assert her su premacy with all the graciousness she could com mand. She did not know how much she had till she tried. Nanny, with courteous, out-stretched hand, advanced straight to the domestic power in black silk. \" We are very glad to be here, Mrs. Williams. \" (Nanny never forgot names.) \" I am sure you have everything in excellent order for us.\" \" And we are very glad to see you, and the young ladies, Sir. \" Mrs. Williams addressed the head of the house in the first place, while she executed her best curtsey in thanks. \" It is good of you, Miss, to give us credit for doing our best. \" \" Laws ! \" said Mrs. Williams afterwards, in con fidential talk with her ally the butler, \"to think"], [96, "86 A BUBBLE FORTUNE. them nasty gossips were beginning to say the new family were nothing but hunder-strappers, had been in trade or somethink; and here they are, as fine an elderly gentleman and as pretty a pair of young ladies as ever I see. And them dressed that simple and right, in plain travelling dresses, where them half and half, as knows no better would have been trapesing in silks and laces. As for Miss Newton, who will be at the head of her pa's table, there ain't much of her to be sure, but what there is might belong to a young duchess.\""], [97, "87 CHAPTER VII. THE FIRST VISITOR AND HIS SUCCESSORS. THE Newtons were passing rich in comparison with what Harry's income as a clerk in an office in Foxchester had been ; but the few thousands a year, which represented the rental of Newton- Hayes, did not constitute them either millionaires or a county family to be courted and caressed, with all their peculiarities to be swallowed at a gulp. The Newtons were only comfort ably well off in the acceptation of the world they had entered. The estate was entailed on male heirs, but as Mr. Newton had no son and was not likely to marry again after he had remained so long a widower, the property might, with the consent of the next heirs, be disentailed, so that respectable dowries could be found for the daugh ters. But, even then, though they might be suit ably provided for, they could be hardly regarded as co-heiresses, unless in the eyes of the needy."], [98, "88 A BUBBLE FORTUNE. Notwithstanding this diminution of social ad vantages, it was a clear gain to the not very populous neighbourhood to have a country-house occupied by fairly presentable people, instead of standing empty, or having for tenants stray visit ors for whose antecedents nobody, as a rule, was inclined to vouch. The Newtons were a branch of the old New tons of Newton-Hayes, who had been \u2014 not to say distinguished, but perfectly creditable \u2014 features of provincial society for a good many more gener ations than any old inhabitant could recall. Of course, their representatives must be noticed, un less they had contracted, in their season of ob scurity, such objectionable traits as could not be passed over by the civilized world. But Lady Gosforth volunteered to be their sponsor; Lady Gosforth was known to this section of Mount shire society and believed in by it, through her cousin, Mrs. Wentworth of St. Catherine's, who was going to call very soon on the Misses Newton. In the meantime, these lucky people were living in an agreeable dream, half doubtful if they were awake, entranced for the moment with their fresh surroundings, and seeking to accommo date themselves to their change of environment. This process might, with many persons, have been so laborious and against the grain as to have"], [99, "THE FIRST VISITOR AND HIS SUCCESSORS. 89 greatly qualified the enjoyment, but it was not so, to begin with, in the Newton's case. Harry was perfect in his philosophy, as ready to be Alexander as to be Diogenes ; not troubling him self greatly with the requirements of empire, be cause of the ever present conviction that he was a man first, while to be an emperor or a squire was a matter of secondary consideration. It was a man \u2014 equally a man who sat in a tub, or on a throne \u2014 who presided at an office desk, or loitered over his newspapers and smoked a dear instead of a cheap brand of cigars on the lawn, and rode a thorough-bred. Therefore, as an inevi table deduction, he could do either when put to the test. Besides, Harry had grown up a rich man's son, though the riches were colonial and had come and gone quickly. He returned easily to many exemptions and indulgences of wealth, like a man born to them. Nanny and Nell had not received the same training, but they were thoroughly well-educated \u2014 (exceptionally intelligent in Nanny's case,) gentle women at heart and still young enough to acquire, without difficulty, the habits of the class into which they had been drafted. Perhaps there is nothing which the sons and daughters of men can more easily pick up than a certain amount of luxurious usage."], [100, "90 A BUBBLE FORTUNE. Newton-Hayes was not superlatively grand, although it stood altogether apart from Paradise Row. It was an old-fashioned rather than an ancient country house, easy to live in and like, as most old-fashioned country houses are. It had not every modern improvement and convenience, such as electric lighting and hot-water pipes. Its grounds, gardens, hot-houses and park which had seemed so extensive as well as so charming to Nanny and Nell, were not really very extensive, far less princely. Its staff of domestics \u2014 indoors and out \u2014 did not amount to much more than a dozen, though they seemed a multitude in relation to Marianne and her sub in Paradise Row. (Mari anne had solved a difficulty by taking the oppor tunity of marrying when the Newtons quitted Foxchester, and the sub was too young to go far from her mother.) The prestige of Newton- Hayes was a modest prestige, respectable for its rank but modest, not like that of a great land owner or a wealthy peer. The place had been kept up, as Mr. Westmacott had said, but a good deal of the furniture was worn and out of date, without being antique. It was solidly substantial, however, and some of it was quaintly elegant. Nanny and Nell had the good taste to see how well it agreed with the house, and had no wish to remove and replace it piecemeal. They were"], [101, "THE FIRST VISITOR AND HIS SUCCESSORS. 91 sensible that, in many lights, nothing could be better than the old oak of the dining-room and the old rosewood and satinwood of the drawing room, and that any alteration, to be in harmony, must be made after much thought and very gra dually. The most disappointing detail was that of the pictures. Nell had indulged in visions, which Nanny had not been guiltless of sharing, of a picture gallery with rows of portraits of knights in armour, and dames and damsels in farthingales and wimples, or at least in the guise of Arcadian shepherdesses. There was no gallery, and the pictures in the public rooms fell considerably short of the mark. If the Newton race went back to knights in ar mour and ladies in farthingales, or else bearing crooks and attended by lambs, the family had not patronised art in those days. The Governor of a West Indian Island, wearing a brown coat with gilt buttons, and a lace cravat and ruffles, and having his hair in a queue was one Newton, who had been painted in his day ; another was an officer who had fought in the American War and was represented in a long vest, a low-necked regimental coat, knee-breeches and silk stockings ; another showed a minor church dignitary in his gown and bands, with a full bottom wig under his shovel hat. The pictures of an old lady in"], [102, "A BUBBLE FORTUNE. 92 a mob cap, with a kerchief crossed over her bosom, and pinned under her chin ; of a young lady in a gypsy hat and a short-sleeved white gown with long black mittens, and of a child, in a cap like that of its grandmother, with a basket. full of cherries, balanced impossibly on its lap, were about the most notable there. Neither Sir Joshua, nor Gainsborough, nor Romney had painted them, which was one reason, perhaps, why they were all so stiff and wooden and generally so hard-featured. The present generations of Newtons, however descended, were a great improvement, in looks, on their progenitors. No likeness of an elderly man with a Napoleonic profile, every curve softened by natural suavity and urbanity, was to be seen among them. No reflection of dainty faces, full of esprit, or of Madonna faces radiant and benignant, were there to foreshadow the per sonalities of Nanny and Nell. Nanny placed a good photograph of their mother on a little easel, and said to herself softly, as she looked at the comely, pleasing lineaments which the sun had preserved in black and white, that the Newton, who had begun by being a Bates, beat in attrac tiveness all the other Newtons of more aristo cratic extraction. An old county family was all very well, but a family of any kind, in which the men were good citizens, sober and diligent, crowned"], [103, "THE FIRST VISITOR AND HIS SUCCESSORS. 93 with true manliness, and the women were modest keepers at home, careful mistresses of their house holds, tender rearers of their children, could com pete with all other families in really estimable qualities, whether physical or spiritual, without fear of the result. The first visitor was a caller on Harry, an elderly man and a widower like Harry, the Newtons' next neighbour, Mr. Peregrine Saville of Briarley. He was tall and thin, suspiciously dark in his moustache and peaked beard, consi dering the sparseness of the closely cut crop on his head, and the manner in which it retreated from his temples. He had an aristocratic face of a fine aquiline type. He was well dressed and well preserved, and yet he had not been able to escape a slightly battered air. He did not need to affect to be a man of the world. He gave most new-comers, introduced to him, the impression that he had gone through many and varied experiences, an impression which the first breath of rumour confirmed. For, as every body who knew anything of the county, was aware and did not hesitate to mention, Mr. Peregrine Saville had led a fast and reckless life from youth to the verge of age. He had run through two fortunes \u2014 one of them his late wife's \u2014 and while keeping up in public the appearance"], [104, "94 A BUBBLE FORTUNE. of connubial felicity, he was supposed to have hastened, in private, the unfortunate lady's exit from the world, by every means short of what would have subjected him to the criminal law. His manners would have been perfect, had there not been a sneering element in his bland cyni cism, to which, to be sure, some people did not object. The same people were inclined to think the lounging grace of a gait, which had never been hurried by any earnest intention, or any useful purpose, and the supercilious droop of the eyelids over the shifty eyes, perfect also. Mr. Peregrine Saville was understood to have sown his wild oats, in the shape of gambling and betting and it was high time he should have sown them. He was in too embarrassed circum stances, with his credit too nearly exhausted, to attempt more than vegetating, with some linger ing remains of sumptuous living and dilettante dandyism, at his stripped and dilapidated place of Briarley. His son and only child, Captain Peregrine, or Captain Perry as he was best known, was in a crack regiment, in which it was readily believed he had a hard fight to live honestly on his pay and his scanty insufficient allowance, since his conscience was reported to be less elastic than that of his worthy father. Harry brought Mr. Saville to the drawing-"], [105, "THE FIRST VISITOR AND HIS SUCCESSORS. 95 room in order to introduce him to his daughters, who gave their verdict upon him when he was gone. \"I think I never met such an agreeable man, except that I am not sure he was not laughing at us in his sleeve all the time, \" said Nell doubt fully. \" He looks as if he could be very enter taining, but I am afraid it would be at other people's expense.\" \"He is detestable,\" said Nanny promptly. \" My dear, \" remonstrated her father, who was present, \" do not be so severe. The poor beggar has hard enough lines dealt out to him without having our hasty condemnation added to them. Think of a man of his age, a fine, dashing fellow, with no end of temptations to lavishness when he began his career, positively hard up in a gentlemanly way. I heard all about it from Westmacott, who, by the way, seems to have rather a prejudice against Saville \u2014 the old story of the fighter with his back at the wall; all the best timber in his very avenue has gone to the hammer. Every building, fence and drain on the land is in a ruinous state.

How should you or I like it, Missie ? \" (An old name of Harry's for Nanny.) \" I should not like it at all, \" said Nanny firmly, \"more than that, I would not have it, whether the difficulties were of my own making or not. I would not go on floundering in the mud out of which there was no possibility of my extricating myself. I would throw everything up and begin afresh.\" \" Easily said, \" declared Harry, with provoking incredulity. Mr. Peregrine Saville was passing his verdict on the two girls, which was so favourable that, if they had heard it, to have found fault with him would have sounded like base ingratitude. \" Fine girls to be the daughters of that simple ton, sorry that my day is too far through for their charms to be of the first interest to me. Gad ! though, one of them might be that fool Perry's bargain, the bigger, rosier and softer of the two. My son is such an ass that he will not sell himself against the gentleman's squeamish taste, and without the possibility of making his wife some return in the shape of conjugal affec tion, domestic bliss and the rest of the rot. He cannot make the barter in the highest market"], [107, "THE FIRST VISITOR AND HIS SUCCESSORS. 97 because we Savilles are on our last legs beyond concealment. What will these Newton girls' fortunes be, I wonder? If the entail were broken to-morrow, I daresay a paltry forty or fifty thou sand would be the utmost. Lord ! we are near the end of our tether when we take such a contemptible sum into consideration. But there is some advantage in having a simpleton for a father-in-law. I've a notion I may find him available as a neighbour and future family con nection. I should not be surprised if the other girl \u2014 the little vixen with the desperately clear cut nose and mouth and sharp gray eyes \u2014 that sort are always vixens \u2014 never marries, does not find a man good enough for her \u2014 insolent gypsy ! But all the better for the warm brown Murillo beauty and for that ungrateful rascal, Perry.\" Other visitors came in succession, on horse and on foot, in masculine traps and feminine pony carriages and high Norwegian carts. Men and women bluff, querulous, heavy, flighty, all well bred, all more or less curious and critical. Harry, without question, was pleased with everybody, and as a rule he pleased people in turn, though he surprised them also. Nell was charmed by the suitability and harmony of the ladies' out-of-door costumes, though they did not appear to be in the extreme of the 7"], [108, "98 A BUBBLE FORTUNE. fashion like those of Ethel and Alaud Pring, and by the ease and self-possession of the wearers' tone and bearing \u2014 though these showed not only the suave agreeability of Mr. Peregrine Saville's conversation, they also betrayed the same lurking, not always restrained, tinge of cynical mockery. Nanny looked and listened with all her might, and paused a little in arriving at a conclusion, which, she was aware, would be of the utmost consequence to her. If Harry took kindly to the gentlemen, he took still more kindly to the ladies, who all began forthwith to pet and make much of him, with a familiarity and freedom, which were a little startling to his daughter's inexperience. \"Are they calling him 'a good creature', 'a poor dear man \u2014 not bad, not at all bad in his hand some, unsophisticated way,' \" Nanny asked herself jealously. \" Are they preparing to make him fetch and carry for them ? \" Nanny continued her private investigation, perhaps more indignantly than she was entitled to feel. Then Nell said, with a little half vexed laugh : \"What kind of Philistines did they expect to find us, Nanny? I saw them exchanging quick glances over those water-colour sketches of yours, which you were arranging in your portfolio, and"], [109, "THE FIRST VISITOR AND HIS SUCCESSORS. 99 at the music on the piano. I don't believe any of them can paint like you, and I think I play and sing tolerably well for an amateur.\" \"Perhaps, my dear, they think us spoilt pro fessionals, \" said Nanny dryly, \" I heard them putting you quietly through a tentative catechism\u2014 Were you a good horse-woman?\" \" And of course I answered I never was on horseback in my life,\" burst in Nell. \" Did you care for driving? was the next article in the cross-examination.\" \" And I told them I could not drive so much as a donkey, though I had ridden one occasion ally,\" explained Nell with a nod. \" Were you just out, or had you been in town the season before last when darling old Lad}' Latimer, whom grandmamma remembered as quite intimate with dear Mrs. Newton, poor Mr. Jasper Newton's wife, died. Indeed, the ladies were related in some degree through Mrs. Jasper Newton, and, in that case, you might be a kins woman also \u2014 not only of Lady Latimer, but of her daughter, Mrs. Van Goring, who gave such charming dances the year before last. \"And I had to own,\" said Nell laughing, \"that I had never heard either of old Lady Latimer or of Mrs. Van Goring, though, if they were related to the late Mr. Newton, there was a faint"], [110, "A BUBBLE FORTUNE. 100 probability that they were related to us in some remote fashion.\" \" Do you know what I am reminded of, Nell ? \" inquired Nanny as she re-arranged a pile of Noisette roses in a bowl near her. The quiet sarcasm of her tone was tempered by a sense of absurdity, which dimpled her cheeks and made her rather grave eyes and the slightly severe curve of her lips shine and quiver with sup pressed laughter. \" It is of an out-of-date book, I daresay these ladies have barely heard of it, though it was a classic in the days of their great-grandmothers ; we read it, without fail, because in France and Germany it is still trans lated by school girls as an example of standard English fiction.\" \"Do you mean 'the Vicar of Wakefield'? asked Nell, puzzled. \" Have you forgotten George, the Vicars second son. and his efforts to get a situation to earn a living at the beginning of the family misfortunes ?

Can we carry our selves on our own small errands \u2014 to show at a meet or to join the luncheon of a shooting party ?' Do we get our smartest frocks from Madame Elise or from Worth ? Did we appear on one magical occasion, as members of a superb crowd in feath ers and trains, and kiss a royal lady's hand?

We may make a mistake, we cannot be perfectly"], [112, "A BUBBLE FORTUNE. 102 sure of the etiquette of the thing. Father is only a man and, though he used to visit at coun try houses, it was long ago, and he is careless of what people in novels- -and I suppose those people who have just been here\u2014 call the bien se'ances. Could not you write to Lady Gosforth and ask her particularly? \" \" Write to Lady Gosforth and ask her to tell us how to behave properly, \" cried Nanny, rearing her small figure with a positively majestic display of impatience and scorn. \" No, though I have the greatest respect for Lady Gosforth, and would ask her advice and follow it too, if it were ne cessary, and if I saw its reasonableness. Don't trouble yourself, Nell, dear, if we do commit small blunders, it is not breaking the moral law. And if it is the interest of these ladies and gen tlemen to overlook our peccadilloes, depend upon it they will find them delightfully piquant and use them as another argument for patronizing us. If it is not their interest, and if the critics are not larger minded and larger hearted, why, they can condemn us to any condign punishment they choose, for anything I care!\" But Nanny was speaking in ignorance and short-sightedness, in spite of her general intel ligence."], [113, "103 CHAPTER VIII. THE ACCEPTANCE OF THE GENERAL INVITATION TO FOXCHESTER, WITH THE RESULT. IT was unfortunate that Lady Gosforth was prevented by a fit of illness from visiting her cousin, Mrs. Wentworth, at St. Catherine's, and the Newtons at Newton-Hayes towards the end of the summer, as she had intended; she might have done some good, she would have given shrewd practical advice, which would have recom mended itself to Nanny's common-sense. Lady Gosforth might have smoothed down certain rumples and bridged over certain gaps, which are sure to arise when people, with not very much in common, brought up differently, with associations which clash, are drawn suddenly into the close contact of a comparatively limited circle. She tried to act by proxy, through her cousin Mrs. Wentworth, but Mrs. Wentworth, though a"], [114, "A BUBBLE FORTUNE. 104 generally well-mannered, friendly woman, was shallow and, in reality, timid. She did not like to take any compromising step, she did not care to go against the verdict of her neighbours ; while Mr. Wentworth, a burly country gentleman, had not time to spare for the question, and the Went worth daughters were too young, to have an opinion of their own, and to act upon it. The Wentworths were willing to call on the Newtons and to show them a little attention, both out of neighbourliness and for the sake of Lady Gosforth, but, as to making any advances to cordial intimacy, these were too rash and daring, and not to be thought of. The Wentworths must wait, until they could see and hear at what conclusions their world in Mountshire arrived, wTith regard to the newcomers, who were undeniably not like other people, not to the manner born of county gentry. It could not be settled on the spur of the moment, whether the interlopers were to be kept at a distance, or admitted freely into the magic ring. There did not seem much harm in the poor suspected people; not one of them could be called vulgarly offensive, though they might all be classed as a little odd, and decidedly out of the running. The old gentleman (Harry was just the man to lapse rapidly into the mingled privileges"], [115, "THE ACCEPTANCE OF THE INVITATION. 105 and deprivations of advancing years) was col lege-bred and looked very good-natured. The girls were unusually pretty and accomplished, and were undeniably ladylike, in an unconventional style, still, they were not exactly like girls in their po sition. The Misses Newton were independent and outrees, as well as primitive in their ideas, and they must suffer for it by undergoing quarantine. Even if Lady Gosforth could have come promptly to the rescue, or if Mrs. Wentworth had been other than what she was, reaction must have set in, just as the girls found driving in the Newton-Hayes carriage convenient but flat, after a time, and Harry shrugged his shoulders presently at the space and style of the gardens. He could not attempt to take them into his own hands. He believed he should never be at li berty to take a spade or a three-pronged fork, or a Dutch hoe in his grip again. He under stood that a spud was the proper tool for a squire, but what did he care for waging war with lawn daisies or plantains ? It was not on his own account that he deprived himself of his hobby; his dignity might take care of itself. It was to save the feelings of his head gardener, Tomkins. Harry would never forget Tomkins' aggrieved, disgusted face, when he found his master had stolen a march upon him, and was digging up a"], [116, "106 A BUBBLE FORTUNE. row of potatoes. Why not? Why not dig po tatoes, as well as look at prize pigs and poke fat cattle in the ribs? But Tomkins did not see it. A country-house garden, with a head gar dener and his subs, was not to be compared for enjoyment to the cockney strip of garden\u2014 as he supposed people would call it \u2014 at Paradise Row. He was his own master there, and the monarch of all he surveyed, in the true sense of the words \u2014 maker as well as monarch. He could almost have wished himself back again. Nanny said less about her desillusionut incut, but she began very soon to wonder where those superior souls, those higher intelligences with the wider horizons, she had expected to find in the society round Newton-Hayes, were to be discov ered. She began to suspect people were much the same in all ranks, a few wise and many foolish, a few larger-hearted and larger-minded and many of meaner calibre. The gossip, in the higher walks of life, might have more polish and refinement, but it was gossip still. It was not less petty, it was, if anything, more frivo lous, and was quite as ill-natured, nay, it had, sometimes, an evilly scandalous element, lacking in the talk ofthe respectable, despised Philistines. The manner might be an immense improvement, to those to whom languid grace and airy inso-"], [117, "THE ACCEPTANCE OF THE INVITATION. 107 lence are everything, the matter was much the same \u2014 inferior on the whole. For did not blase, idleness, the want of a serious pursuit even in earning a livelihood, or making money, the con sciousness of a mill-stone of debts, round many a so-called high-bred neck, with no escape from ruin, save by the adoption of the meanest, most ignoble shifts, cause infallible deterioration and degradation ? Nanny did not entertain quite these sentiments, when a jocose letter arrived from Foxchester, written in the name of Mr. Pring, announcing that he and Coppock were about to take their friend Newton at his word, on the following day, in order to have the first pop at the partridges, and, for once in his life, old Coxe was to bear them company, to keep them in order and see that they were good boys during their outing. Even Harry looked a little blank, when he read the letter, though his countenance quickly cleared, and he hurried away to speak to his game-keeper and arrange about sending early to the station, next morning. Then he came back to consult Nanny, on what they had better have for lunch and dinner, to suit the visitors. \" Personal friends, you know,\" said Harry hastily, \" delighted to see them, must do our best for them, and take care that they enjoy themselves.\""], [118, "108 A BUBBLE FORTUNE.

Nanny never forgot that incursion of Foxches ter worthies, though she was vexed with herself for minding it so much. She felt she was dis loyal to both father and mother, in being greatly put out. Yet, from beginning to end, the couple of days was an unmitigated trial. The visitors arrived, with one exception, in a hilarious mood. Mr. Pring and Mr. Coppock always took their pleasures noisily. Mr. Coppock was a decidedly stout man, though active for his size and years; Mr. Pring was conspicuously dilapidated. They wore fancy check shooting suits, and reminded Nanny irresistibly of the comic illustrations of sporting tours \u2014 yet neither man was a cockney, and both were fair shots. They had a consider able amount of practice, Air. Pring not only took out a license, but shot, every September, over whatever yeoman's farm he could command.

From the moment of their arrival Messrs. Pring and Coppock were hail-fellow-well-met with every body. They talked and laughed their loudest, discussed racy Foxchester news, wondered, before the servants in the background, how many ad mirers the young ladies had found in Mountshire, and which of the girls wrould be the first to go off. Air. Coppock, with true free and easy wit, kept addressing every man and maid he encoun tered as, \" Here you, Samivel, Jonathan, Marianne, Anna Mariar,\" to the tittering bewilderment of the domestic staff. Mr. Pring did not wait for his host to ask him, a second time, to help himself to a brandy and soda, yet he stood so greatly in need of farther refreshment, that, in walking through the village of Hayes, on his way to the nearest"], [122, "A BUBBLE FORTUNE. 112 plantation, he felt compelled to drop into the first ale-house in order to ascertain whether the pub lican's beer was \" clear.\" \" Your tipple's all very well, my boy,\" Mr. Pring told Harry, with a bibulous wink, \" but after all there is nothing like a pub, for a man, when he is hanged thirsty.\" \" Go ahead, Pring,\" shouted the jovial Coppock, \" there are plenty of wheel-barrows about. \" Nanny and Nell did not meet the sportsmen in order to give them afternoon tea, but Nanny saw all that happened in her mind's eye, as dis tinctly as if she had been present. How the two \" poppers \", at Harry's partridges, would go stamp ing, banging and shouting, right and left. How the invaders would not be careful to keep to their entertainer's side of the road, but, in spite of Harry's remonstrances, would stray defiantly, laughing in his face, as far adrift as an afternoon's shooting would carry them. They strayed into the Briarley preserves, of all places, as Nanny afterwards learnt to her disgust. The men came \"slap\", as they expressed it, on the Grand Turk himself. He accepted Harry's stammered apol ogy most readily and courteously, while he took in the whole situation at a glance, through his half-closed eye-lids, and sneered his -Mephisto pheles sneer under his moustache. He made a"], [123, "THE ACCEPTANCE OF THE INVITATION. 113 note of the scene, to serve as stock for the next company he entered. Mr. Coxe did not put himself forward, but he spied the land, beyond any manner of doubt. His curiosity was insatiable. He asked the game keeper how many boxes of birds were sent to the London Market, he took the liberty of cross examining the man as to his wages. The law yer even lagged behind and accosted a farmer and his wife who were walking their horse and market-cart up a hill, to inquire what were the market-prices for farm produce, in that part of the county, and if they could tell him what was the value of land, per acre, of the home farm, which the agent for the squire had managed for the late Air. Newton. The dinner at Newton-Hayes that day was uproarious, and Nanny and Nell sat sick at heart, waiting for the gentlemen's appearance in the drawing-room afterwards. The reality was worse than the anticipation in the unsteady steps, the thickened voices, the fumes of wine and brandy. Even Air. Coxe's habitual sobriety had been unable to stand the force of evil example. Harry, as host, was beyond escape. The one redeeming circumstance was the accident of Mr. Coppock falling asleep, and snoring heavily on a lounge, which groaned under 8"], [124, "A BUBBLE FORTUNE. 114 his weight, in a corner of the drawing-room. He had previously given Nell a hiccuping invi tation to the piano, and she had been too pained and frightened to refuse his command rather than request. It was well known in Foxchester that its Mayor, however good-natured when sober, had a propensity to be quarrelsome in his cups, which, fortunately, were incidental, not perennial, like Air. Pring's. If the last degradation of a drunken row had wound up the festivity, Nanny felt as if she and Nell must have hidden their humbled heads for evermore. As for Air. Pring, he wasplacable, not belligerent, under the influence of the stimulants to which he was so well accustomed. He was content to smile in a maudlin fashion, to listen to Nell's tremulous music, and to play a never ending game of draughts with Harry, in which the players were constantly dropping their pieces, while Air. Coxe looked on solemnly. The second day was like the first, but relief was at hand. The guests left by the last train which stopped at the little station, and even Harry drew a shame-faced sigh of satisfaction when they were gone.

I 1 5 the style of company, which had been down to Newton-Hayes, was taken to pieces and torn to tatters. It was told, as a well authenticated fact, that the late Airs. Harry Newton had been the daughter ofa tradesman in Oxford \u2014 of all exclusive regions, sacred to learning and the golden youth of the upper ten thousand. Harry's career there leaked out. He had not been rusticated, it could not even be said that he was plucked, since he had to quit the University in the middle of his curriculum, on his father's ruin. But he was said to have displayed inveterately low tastes, and to have elected himself unfit for the company of gentlemen. There was a more sinister report that his father had been either a convict or a bushranger, but nobody who had been in Harry's company could give credence to this last sop to Cerberus. The two daughters were to be pitied, poor things, for though they came of the people, the girls were not like unlicked cubs, or miserable cads of boys. The Alisses Newton might lack a je ne sais quoi of breeding, but they were a pair of beauties in their different styles, as well as having small fortunes, fit enough to pass muster, well educated and all that kind of rot.

True, the fellow had the coolness to tell me he did not mean to hunt, though he had paid the subscription, that he never had a mania for killing creatures at any time, perhaps, because he had been rather fond of studying them and their habits; when he was a young fellow he could have set up a bear-garden or a menagerie, with all the pleasure in life. I tell you, the beggar is no good. If he should get a seat on the bench, it is as likely as not he will take the part of some scoundrelly poacher.

Mr. Peregrine Saville would not treat his daugh ter-in-law as he treated his wife, and, even to her, his manner in public was not amiss, he had the instincts of a gentleman so far. But there could be no question of such a cruel risk for either of the girls, if young Saville resembled his father. They say he does not; that he is a nice young fellow, who has kept as much out of debt as could be expected of a man, whose father bor rows from him, so I heard Colonel Wentworth say. The last sum of money they raised was entirely to relieve the old man. Briarley may see better days \u2014 I remember it, a dear old place, when I was taken there, as a little girl, in the time of this man's father. It is a pity that our old places should be allowed to fall down, and our old families to die out, though I have no doubt that little radical, Nanny Newton, would ask where was the loss ?

Nobody at Newton-Hayes liked the sensation, and Harry, especially, was the worse for it. He was already suffering from the want of a regular occupation, such as he had been accustomed to for more than twenty years. It bad not been congenial at first, but it had grown a second nature to him. He was like Othello, with his occupation gone, by comparison, for he could only take a mild interest in the gardens and greenhouses, when he did not feel at liberty to thrust a spade into the ground, or to turn out a flower pot. The long walks of his youth lost their zest, when he had to make a business of them, and he was not so good a walker as he had been.

He dropped in upon one of his tenants now and then, and in quired after the crops and the live-stock. He would have swallowed a glass of beer, or a cup of tea, in any of the farm-houses, with pleasure, but the farmers and their wives were not at ease with him. The more he was at ease, telling them of what he remembered of the sheep-runs and bush doings in Australia, and of his experiences in raising earlier cabbages and bigger strawber ries than his gardener could match at Newton- Hayes, in his little garden at Paradise Row, the more his audience stared, and the less they said in reply, till he felt damped in his simple eloquence. Then, though their tongues would not wag on any other subject, they went glibly enough in recounting the farmers' grievances, and requesting favours, which Harry found it difficult to question and deny in the circumstances. But there was the Devil to pay with Westmacott, who came down on Harry, the next time they met, doubly deferential in tone \u2014 Harry hated people to be deferential to him \u2014 to carry off the agent's strong implication that Air.

Upon the whole, Harry's greatest diversion was to stroll over to Briarley and have a game at billiards with Saville. The girls did not like the man, and he might not have been a saint, but who and what was Harry that he should judge ? He owed much neighbourly kindness to Saville, a deal more than to those stuck-up specimens of country gentlemen around, who held themselves too good for a rusty colonial product that had been called on to earn his living for a score of years. Saville was an amusing beggar in his cynical way, and he had always a welcome for an idle, bored, old fellow.

I am quite clear it would be no honour to possess his respect and esteem.\" She stopped for a moment, and then went on again hastily, \"Perhaps we are not quite entitled to object to Mr. Saville's manner, if father sees all the time, as I think he sees, through the other man.\" \" What ! \" exclaimed Nell incredulously, opening wide her brown eyes, \" and yet make a friend of him?\" \" If father does not mind \u2014 there are things father does not mind \u2014 much.\" Nell understood now and was silent. There was a pause, while the girls sipped their tea and ate their bread and butter in the warm firelight. It lit up the drawing-room with a pleasant glow. The whole scene was pretty, with its old and new fashions, and its signs of the refined and cultured tastes of the two very attractive young women in the foreground. Nell broke the silence this time, and, it must be confessed, there was now a shade of queru lousness, as well as of plaintiveness, in her voice. \" I think, Nanny, now that the weather is getting"], [142, "A BUBBLE FORTUNE. 132 colder, that Airs.

Father, who used to find relish for whatever was put before him, looked exceedingly put out yesterday, when he discovered cook had committed the enormity of running out of anchovy sauce, and I caught myself feeling badly treated because there was too much lemon in my pet pudding. Do you remember, at Paradise Row, when you let the butcher's bill get beyond the average account and we had to retrench on fried liver, white herrings and rice and milk ? \" \" Ah ! those were happy days, \" cried Nell wistfully. \"And these are happy days,\" said Nanny determinedly. \"Look round you, Nell,\" and she glanced about her at the ideal room, and down at her own and her sister's comfortable, becom ing frocks. \" How much we have to be thankful"], [143, "LADY GOSFORTH'S OPINION. 133 for!

But that was not what I was going to say, I meant to hint that the Lascelles and Barrets are surely at liberty to ask the company they prefer, and if they do not want us, we may return the compliment, and I say sincerely, on my part, we do not want them.\" \"But you will allow it is a little dull to be left so much to ourselves, and never to get nearer to our neighbours, who are having good times among themselves.

CAPTAIN PERRY APPEARS ON THE STAGE. MR. PEREGRINE SAVILLE took occasion to bring forward his son's name, with toler able frequency, in conversation with both Harry Newton and his daughters. The old man ofthe world was not so left to himself as to attempt to play the part of a fond father, besides, he would not have regarded the role as good form. But he contrived to convey the impression that the young man was a person of some importance, that, when he came to Briarley, his presence was a decided acquisition to the society of the neigh bourhood, and that, for special reasons, the mas ter of Briarley particularly desired the company of his son and heir at this time. The wish did not seem to be reciprocated ; Captain Perry resisted alike the temptations of the paternal par tridges, hares and pheasants. He suffered his father to make up the number of his \" guns \" m"], [148, "138 A BUBBLE FORTUNE. without him. The young man did his shooting elsewhere. He was even guilty of abandoning his senior, to solitude and bills, at the festive season of Christmas. Captain Perry only turned up, with lagging steps, at Briarley, towards the end of the April which followed the arrival of the Newtons at Newton-Hayes, the previous midsummer. Harry Newton, who was nothing if he was not sympathetic, had allowed himself, in the dearth of other interests, to get deeply concerned with the personality of the young man and to count on his arrival as a great event. Nanny and Nell, with whom Air. Peregrine Saville had made no way, in spite of his graces, which were indeed, in their unsophisticated eyes, the greatly-to-be-deprecated airs of an elderly Adonis and Satyr in one, took but a languid interest in the long-heralded, long-delayed arri val of the hero, who was of such decidedly unde sirable parentage. The interest would have been slighter still, had it not been for the quietness of their lives, which weighed somewhat heavily on the less original and independent of the two girls. There had been some talk of the family's going up to town in the course of the spring. But Harry had always hated large towns and London in particular, while he was still sufficiently floral"], [149, "\u2713 CAPTAIN PERRY APPEARS ON THE STAGE. 139 in his bent to render him unwilling to quit New ton-Hayes which he was just beginning to call his place, at the very time when nature was recalling her forces and putting on her first robe of beauty for the season. Nanny and Nell had not urged the change. Nanny was the leader, and she had, in some measure, learnt her lesson from the disappoint ment she had experienced, in not finding a higher mental and moral standard, among her section of the Alountshire gentry. She began to fear that, even with the certainty of the picture gal leries, the theatre and the opera, she would feel lonely in London as at Newton-Hayes, she would still be craving for that communion of souls, that infinitely wider, higher atmosphere, which had, so far, been unattainable. As for Nell, though she was not so opposed to stone and lime as her father was, and though she did not ask as much from her fellow-creatures as Nanny asked, she had not enough will to exert it against theirs. It was only at intervals that her sunshiny, con tented nature was not pretty well resigned to those mortifications and deprivations, which went a certain distance in counterbalancing th.e advan tages of Newton-Hayes. Harry Newton, who had reached the point of being over at Briarley at some hour during most"], [150, "A BUBBLE FORTUNE. 140 days, was the person who brought the news, and aired it at the dinner table, that Captain Perry was, at last, \"to hand.\" Harry announced further, with much empressement, that Saville was to bring over his son to lunch, on the following day ; Saville had said \"to call on the young ladies,\" but he\u2014 Harry \u2014 insisted on making an amendment on the proposal. The girls were not entirely without curiosity with regard to the newcomer, and they were too good-natured and too fond of their father not to call up as much as they could command on the spur of the moment, that they might discuss, with proper animation, an incident which was evidently a matter of moment to the speaker. Nanny sup pressed the remark which was on the tip of her tongue: \"Had Air. Saville turned bear-leader?\" because her father did not like to hear sharp speeches from his girls. Nell made a hurried selection of an entree in order to look over brightly to her father and ask, \" Is Captain Per ry \u2014 I wonder why people here always call him Captain Perry and not Captain Peregrine? \u2014 like his father? \" \" My dear, this is his native place, \" Harry reminded her. \" I daresay he was simply ' Perry ' in the nursery and the school-room, probably at college too, though, in my day, our chums, if"], [151, "CAPTAIN PERRY APPEARS ON THE STAGE.

He was \"Fresh Butter,\" or \"Butter in a pickle,\" accord ing to circumstances. \u2014No, I should not say Cap tain Perry was like his father; not so fine a man as Saville must have been, but in some respects, \" with a wary glance at the glossy black back of the butler \u2014 generally a stumbling block to true, social intercourse in his master's eyes, \" in some respects, I am not sure that there are not people who would prefer the younger man \u2014 a nice sensible fellow, I should say \u2014 gentlemanlike, that goes without saying, and not such a mar tinet or haw-haw dandy, as your young military man is apt to be in piping times of peace, it strikes me.\" The subject so bulked in Harry's mind that he talked to Nanny in the drawing-room later, on her seeing that Airs. Williams was not taken unawares, on her making a point of everything \" being as it ought to be, for Saville is a parti cular beggar, I can tell you. He submits to no omissions and puts up with no nonsense, however much his finances may be out of order.\""], [152, "A BUBBLE FORTUNE. 142 This from Harry, who was once the most easily served man in England ! The girls, even Nanny, were driven, in their turn, to make an event of Captain Perry's visit, and girl-like their minds dwelt on their morning dress and what would be best for them to wear at lunch. Their slender society experience had more to do with afternoon teas, evening parties, even big dinners than with lunches. But, certainly,, their fresh spring frocks with their dainty frilling were good enough for a casual visitor, like Captain Perry. As it happened, neither Airs. Williams' credit as housekeeper and head cook, nor Nanny \"s and Nell's good taste and judgment in dress were put to the test, so far as Captain Perry was con cerned. His father came without him, full of bland apologies for his son's unavoidable absence. The day was raw and misty, as April sometimes for gets herself so far as to be. The unpropitious weather ought to have been a tnfle light as air to a young man, and a soldier, with an irresistible inducement offered to him ; but, it seemed, Captain Perry's campaigns had quartered him, at some period of his martial career, in an ague-haunted region, which had subjected him to an illness, leaving effects on his constitution. He was, at that moment, suffering from such a racking headache, that not even the presence of two"], [153, "CAPTAIN PERRY APPEARS ON THE STAGE. 143 charming young ladies could charm it away. Besides, it would be cruel to make the poor fellow appear at such signal disadvantage, in circum stances in which he would naturally desire to be at his best. Harry was so full of honest com miseration for the victim that the girls were not called upon to express more than the merest perfunctory regrets. \"Rather rude of Captain Perry, don't you think so, Nanny? \" suggested Nell, with a pout and a disconsolate glance at a new girdle. \" He might surely have borne a headache for the hour that lunch lasts.\" \" He would have borne it if his inclination to come had been stronger, I daresay, or he may not care to be trotted out by his father. But oh! dear, what a fuss about nothing \u2014 about some spoilt Adonis of a barrackyard not choosing to accept an impromptu invitation to lunch ! \" \"Father said he was a nice sensible fellow,\" objected Nell, reproachfully. \" Aly dear Nell, I hope it is not disparaging father's friendliness \u2014 rather the reverse \u2014 to hint that he is not very hard to please, and that his swans sometimes turn out to be geese.\" Nanny sighed as she spoke, for she was forced to admit, in her inmost heart, though she would not have readily owned it, even to her sister, that men of"], [154, "A BUBBLE FORTUNE. 144 Harry Newton's nature are apt to have a posi tive infatuation for geese in the guise of swans, in preference to the real article. Though Captain Perry had excused himself from lunching at Newton-Hayes in company with his father, he could not, if he paid any heed to the most rudimentary politeness, get off from calling on the Newtons at an early date. He came by himself one afternoon, late, as it seemed to the girls, but not so late, if they had fully understood what fashion, with its whimsical dictates, enjoined, and he sat not longer than the regula tion ten minutes. Harry was not in the house, and the girls had to entertain their visitor with out assistance; yet, strange to say, they were not so ill-assured as he was, man of the world and of society as he might be supposed to be, in contrast with novices like Nanny and Nell. He was unmistakably put out in the matter of all the customary usages on such occasions, which ought to have been as common as the air he breathed, to him. He could not conceal a shade of reluctance, affront and unwillingness to have anything to do with the part he was playing. Yet, as Harry had said, young Saville's face and manner were not without their recommenda tions. He was not handsome as his father had been, and still was, in certain lights. Captain"], [155, "CAPTAIN PERRY APPEARS ON THE STAGE. 145 Perry would never look either supercilious or blase. These were two items with regard to which he was, to one order of mind, greatly inferior to his respected parent. But there was something trustworthy in the younger man's harsher, blunter features, in his heavier eyebrows, and fuller mouth under his light moustache. There was an intangible some thing in his looks, which implied that Perry Saville might be a gentleman in more respects than in those of an old name and graceful manners. The expression of discomfort and ruefulness about the visitor yielded a little to the girls' simple, courteous greeting; and he half restively, half covertly, looked more at Nell than he need have looked, as at forbidden fruit, forbidden to him by his own decree, if not by the mandate of others, whose attractions he could not, strive as he might, altogether resist. \" What made the man so glum and absent minded? \" Nell asked, in unaffected wonder, of her sister, after he was gone. \" He sat in that nice corner chair as if he were on the edge of a precipice.

Even if his regiment is not called out on active service, I suppose he must attend drill and parade, which will be intolerable with constant headache. I am really sorry for him, especially as I do not have a headache above once in six months, and, generally, I have myself to blame for it. I have been sitting out in the sun or I have been wear ing a hat which hurt me.

Nanny's eyes, as she looked, held a mixture of fun, of consideration for Nell's innocence, and of impatience with Captain Perry. \" Of course you ought to tell me, \" cried Nell, rising to the bait, as when she was a little girl and dearly loved to have a secret confided to her keeping, \" that is, if you have anything to tell, which I am inclined to doubt.

But, in spite of the worldly mind edness of society, there was a section of it whose approval would have been bestowed more cha rily, if the discovery had been made that Perry Saville was prepared to do a great deal more than play a son's part, in keeping a scape-grace of a father from being swamped, by his debts, in his later years. Filial piety, irrespective of the worthiness of its object, was distinctly to be com mended, but it would be going beyond the pro vince of filial piety for a young man to lend himself readily to audaciously mendacious schemes."], [167, "A DAY MARKED WITH A WHITE STONE. 1, 5 7 Nevertheless Captain Perry came to New ton-Hayes in full comprehension of the unfa vourable verdict which might be pronounced on his motives. He could not resist coming, allured, as Nanny Newton had conjectured correctly, by an attraction which had met him on his first visit, even with his teeth set on edge by galled pride and a sense of outraged honesty. He had looked and looked again at what had captivated him, always in spite of himself, always as if he were not looking, because he could not trust his sincerity for the moment, because the good and gracious sight which won him, was marred and poisoned to him by the intervening ugly, base and sordid ends for which he was required to regard it. All the same, Nell Newton was the loveliest, most lovable girl he had ever encoun tered, and he must put himself in her way again, though he was altogether unworthy of her, though remembering what he remembered of his father's crafty counsels and machinations, it seemed to him he could never be anything more to her than he was now. It would be profanation for him to approach her nearer. All this might be in Captain Perry's sensi tive inner consciousness, but it did not prevent a great outward change in his speech and demean our as his foot quickened and his eye kindled"], [168, "158 A BUBBLE FORTUNE. in walking up the avenue, running up the hall steps, mounting the stairs which were to take him into the presence that was enthralling him. The stifling and paralysing stiffness, the harassed air of repressed annoyance and lurking affront dropped from him. They were but so many accidental and temporary rags and tags of the painful ex perience which belonged to his father's son. He stood, revealed in his true colours, a nice young fellow, pleasant, cordial, upright, all the manlier for the discipline he had undergone, possessed of plenty of common sense if of nothing exceptionally intellectual to distinguish him from the crowd. He felt, without acknowledging it to himself, that there were two sides to the question. It would have been contemptible, according to the best English notions \u2014 the English notions which are not emasculated and demoralized, but ring true in whatever rank of life \u2014 to follow his father's lead in calmly sitting down and taking an estimate of Nanny or Nell Newton's probable fortune, and then setting himself to get it into his hands, and, by means of the windfall, to repair the dilapidations of Briarley, and pay off the most clamorous of his father's creditors. True, he might resolve beforehand, that he would not be grossly faithless and cruel to his wife behind backs, as his father had been to his mother."], [169, "A DAY MARKED WrITH A WHITE STONE. 159 Captain Perry might even treat his wife with reasonable consideration and kindness, still, there would be the loveless marriage \u2014 loveless on his side at least \u2014 the mark of the beast, the stigma of mercenariness would abide. There would re main for himself the sacrifice of all that was most unselfish and tender in his nature, with the sacrifice from another of what she had a right to demand \u2014 the homage of his heart, the first place in his affections, the knowledge that she was the realization of his ideal. The blight of a deadly commonplaceness and prosaicness, however gilded, would rest thenceforth on his hearth and home, because of a union begun and finished, not in all that was sweetest and holiest in hu manity, but according to the maxims of approved worldly wisdom. Happily, there was quite another side. There was no degradation in being smitten, in every sense and faculty, by the best and most beauti ful woman in the world. Degradation? no, there was exaltation in the fact. And so Captain Perry regained the dignity of his manhood and the control of his natural gifts, together with the mastery of circumstances. Love does much more than laugh at locksmiths in removing mountains and destroying barriers, which, without its all-powerful aid, a man of"], [170, "160 A BUBBLE FORTUNE. Captain Perry's honesty of principle and deli cacy of honour could not have surmounted. To love, a fortune more or less, on either side, dwin dled into insignificance. What was Nell Newton's fortune save the merest dross, in comparison to her priceless merits, in the eyes of her ardent lover? He loved her for herself alone \u2014 he knew it and she would know it, that was the chief thing. What could man ask more? As for Air. Peregrine Saville's plots and ma n\u0153uvres, his son forgot all about them, except when they were forced upon his notice, and then he viewed them with astonishment no less than with repugnance, as if he had never before heard of such incongruous and revolting speculations. Good son as he was, he would glare at the grinning author of his being, until Perry Saville lost sight once more of all about his father and his grovelling aims, in the first rebound of the young man's mind to Nell Newton. Love was playing the same tricks with Nell as with Perry ; she had declared that she could not say a civil word to him again, that she would die with shame at beholding him, that she must hate the sight of him because of the mortification he had inadvertently caused her. She had made an amendment on second thoughts. She had con fided to Nanny that, if a man, on whom she had"], [171, "A DAY MARKED WITH A WHITE STONE. 161 never wasted a thought, had been so silly as to lose his heart to her, and she had been com pelled to refuse him, it would have been exceed ingly disagreeable, but it would not have been so humiliating as to find another man recoiling from her because of his supposed need of any money she might inherit. The next worst thing to seeking her for it, was the only too palpable evidence of his drawing back from her on ac count of it, as if she set store upon it and was prepared to impute interested designs to any man who approached her. But, as a matter of course, Nell had to say civil words to Captain Perry, and, as he kept coming to Newton-Hayes, she could not go on hating him. It would have been too tremendous an effort for a creature of so placable a disposi tion, so guiltless of arrogance and self conceit, as Nell was; nay, when she detected, with her swift womanly intuition, the love light which began to glow in young Saville's eyes, and flush his cheek, and to render him either mute or elo quent in her company, her gentle heart melted and relented entirely. With the unstinted trust and generous bounty of a royal giver, she began to pay him back richly in his own coin, to let her eyes fall before his, to be unable to keep her fingers from trembling in his eager clasp or i i"], [172, "162 A BUBBLE FORTUNE. to withhold from him her softest tones and kindest words. Was Air. Peregrine Saville an odious old man ? Had he impudently schemed to marry his son to one of the Newton girls in order to get hold of her money ? Ah ! what scandal was spread abroad, what slanders uttered. Who knew what tempta tions had beset the squire of Briarley or how even his regard for his son might act upon him as a last temptation? anyhow, no man was ac countable for his father's sins, and poor Captain Perry was only the more to be pitied and liked because he had such a father. Air. Peregrine Saville saw it all with the great est glee and triumph. He had snared his birds \u2014 one of them being his son \u2014 without the slightest trouble. He had feared some highfalutin and straight-laced humbug on that solemn young ass Perry's part, but there had been only the merest threatening of it to begin with, when straightway the boy had played into his father's hand. Harry recognized signs with which he had been familiar when he was courting Lucy Bates, and they threw a morning glory and glamour over him as if he were courting her again, which helped to render him forgetful of everything else and to hold him passive, though the thought of"], [173, "A DAY MARKED WITH A WHITE STONE. 163 parting from Nell \u2014 \" her mother's daughter \" \u2014 when definitely realized, struck a chill to his heart. Nanny saw what was going to happen at the very moment when she was least prepared for it. She could never have imagined anything serious coming out of the provoking contre-temps, though she had rather liked Captain Perry in spite of it. Now Nell was on the point of for getting every detail in connection with that \" odious old man,\" if she was not weak enough to trans form him into an angel of light, he was made an argument in Captain Perry's favour. Nanny had always magnified the obligations of her slight seniority over Nell; she had felt for her sister, as she had hardly felt for herself, that Nell was motherless, that Harry, with all his eminently lovable qualities, was not the most desirable father for two motherless, brotherless girls. Nanny had been jealous over Nell and careful for her, in a way which she herself had often likened to a dragon rather than to a sister, one 01 two years older. This was in addition to the fact that the sisters had never been apart, and had been nearly everything to each other, so that the shadow beforehand of an interloper between them, who should part them, and usurp the best that the one had to give, which had formerly belonged to the other, without question, cost in itself a sharp"], [174, "164 A BUBBLE FORTUNE. pang to the sister left behind. But Nanny tried to think what would be best for Nell. She shut her eyes and sought to realize what it would be to see Nell, in the perfection of her womanhood, a happy wife and mother. Could she \u2014 Nanny \u2014 not stand aside for that, look on and rejoice, be contented to care for her father and to be at hand as a referee for Nell, when her husband was not sufficient for her? And Nell would need all the backing and support which could be found for her, in an undertaking which undoubtedly had its arduous side. To marry the heir of a ruined man was no great marriage for Nell; but Nanny saw, quite as keenly as Air. Peregrine Saville could see, what Newton-Hayes might do for Briarlev, while the present master of Briarley would not live for ever. Last, but not least, there was the advantage of near neighbourhood, if, as was probable, Captain Perry left the army and took up his quarters at Briarley. Nell would only go next door, as it were, and could be seen most days. Altogether Nanny could be magnanimous, she could let matters take their course as Providence and love willed, and not cloud this beautiful new crown of joy which had risen, as out of dust and ashes, to crown Nell. Air. Peregrine, Saville, in his satisfaction, resolved"], [175, "A DAY MARKED WITH A WHITE STONE. 165 on a master-stroke of genius to expedite matters before Perry's leave of absence should expire. He would make a public demonstration of the promising state of affairs, and call in every aid, kindred and social, to ensure his and his son's success, and to minimize the chances of any change of aspect on the Newtons' part. Mr. Peregrine Saville's resources were limited, for the domestic machinery of Briarley was utterly crippled \u2014 except in the items which had to do with his own comfort. He did not care to apply to Perry in order to raise the wind and supply all that was wanted. The boy had such strange, methodistical, commercial notions about unneces sarily spending and paying for what was spent. It would not signify to him \u2014 what the elder man was convinced of \u2014 that no sane creditor in the universe would object to a small outlay, with the good hope of securing the heiress to a respectable fortune for the impoverished son of the house. Mr. Peregrine Saville settled eventually to make the best of the means at his disposal, and he chuckled to himself at the very decorous, elderly dowager nature of the result. The season was over for hunt breakfasts, he could not on any pretence \u2014 not even in honour of his fair neigh bours \u2014 inaugurate a ball. But he could seize on a passing pretext for introducing an avant cottrier"], [176, "166 A BUBBLE FORTUNE. of the garden parties, which waited for Alidsum mer to be put in force \u2014 a garden party, in the second week of Alay, with tennis for the hardier tennis players, a game of billiards for the older and more prudent guests, who dared not defy a spice of east wind out of doors, tea in the draw ing-room, and in the library \u2014 as the mere mention of claret cup still sent a shiver down the back bone \u2014 mulled port and a petit verre or two, to temper the balmy breath of spring. Briarley had, in the time of the present squire, lost, one by one, all its boasted attractions. It had, originally, been an older and finer place than Newton-Hayes, but its chief advantages had latterly mouldered, crumbled, and succumbed to the attacks of time and neglect. Its distinctions resolved themselves largely into the fine stacks of chimneys. The entrance hall remained, but the carved oak balustrades of the staircase, which had opened from it. and bestowed on it the finishing touch, had been removed, sold for what they were worth and replaced by a cheap and shoddy sub stitute. The pictures and ornaments, which were not absolute heirlooms, were gone long ago. The carpets and hangings were faded and thread bare. Every good tree in thc park had been sacrificed at one time or another, and the larger part of the turfy glades was converted into graz-"], [177, "167 A DAY MARKED WITH A WHITE STONE. ing ground for the sheep and cattle on the home farm. The fences and gates were not falling to pieces, but they had been replaced after a purely utilitarian fashion. The house stood like a wreck of former state and bounty, drooping and shrink ing in the merciless exposure of its present inharmonious surroundings. The American garden with its rhododendrons, the Italian garden with its cypresses \u2014 the pride of bygone generations \u2014 were wildernesses. The rose garden, the delight of those ladies of Briarley, who had themselves long lain in the silence and darkness of the family vault, would have been a laughing stock, if its dwindling blossom and cankered buds had been presented, in their season, to modern rose growers. The terrace in front and on the south ern side of the house, was grown green with damp and decay, and displayed only broken balustrades, mutilated statues, fountains which had ceased to play, and a central sun-dial minus a nose. Nothing had been cared for and kept up at Briarley for many a year. There had been neither funds nor heart for restitution. The seasons, as they came and went, had been veri table destroyers. To invite guests to such a domain was like asking them to witness a com mentary on riotous living, and the dearth which follows excess."], [178, "168 A BUBBLE FORTUNE. But there had been one thing which did not need to be kept up. There was a short part of the year during which the old forlorn gardens, whether walked in or seen from the terrace, could compare advantageously with the most carefully preserved and improved upon, the very choicest gardens of the neighbouring country-houses. Roses demand constant watchful tending and costly replacement, but what of the older fash ioned families of the lily tribe, which prefer to be let alone, which flourish best in the shady, untrimmed, undisturbed borders of old gardens, in which everything else is running wild and degenerat ing? In fine Aprils and Alays, the time of the pear and apple blossom and the season of jon quils, narcissi \u2014 single and double \u2014 the Briarley gardens were still a sight to see, with their fields of living snow \" warm in the sun rays, \" and with yellow sheaves which were not grain. Air. Perigrine Saville had the good idea of inviting his neighbours, far and near \u2014 as a poor return for their indulgent fidelity to an old ally \u2014 to come and witness the modest old English glory of his spring gardens, and partake of the humble fare and innocent entertainment \u2014 all his broken fortunes would allow him to offer his friends. Air. Peregrine Saville did more, he enlisted the"], [179, "A DAY MARKED WTITH A WHITE STONE. 169 good offices of a cousin, a Viscountess, who was down in the country for the Easter holidays at her Viscount's place, fifteen miles away. By urgent representations of the importance of the crisis in the family affairs, and appeals to kindred blood to come to his help in his last stand against adversity \"for Perry's sake,\" he got her to con sent to act as hostess, to preside over the mild festivities and carry them off by the countenance she bestowed on them. Above all, he trusted she would show an example, which all his good natured friends, among the matrons and dowagers of the party, ought to follow, in the empressement with which, from the moment the family from Newton-Hayes were introduced to her, she would receive them and mark them out from the other guests. The bait of the studiously unassuming fete with its aristocratic hostess, was to be dangled before the Newtons' unsophisticated eyes, as an inducement to enter the family of which the Viscountess was an illustrious member. The master of the ceremonies had also the good luck to catch Lady Gosforth, who was likewise spending her Easter in Mountshire, with her cousins, the Wentworths, and to find her more propitious than he could have hoped for his pur poses. Everything \u2014 even to the fineness ofthe weather \u2014"], [180, "A BUBBLE FORTUNE. 170 went in accordance with the wishes of the origi nator of the gathering, and what a wonderful dream-like, enchanted day it was to the Newtons, especially to the girls \u2014 girls every inch of them! For the occasion even Nanny yielded to the spell. Suddenly they found themselves withdrawn from the cold shadows of the county, and promoted to the full sunshine of social popularity, as if they were the queens of the hour, with their gifts and graces all at once discovered, reckoned up, and made to achieve an incontestable triumph. At last the Newtons were placed on a level with the Aylmers, Lascelles, Barrets and ready to take precedence of them as Nell was so much lovelier, Xanny so much wiser than their competitors. The Viscountess, who was rather a personage in Alount shire, singled out the Newtons for her attentions, with charming frankness and naivete. She was pleasantly cordial to Harry, she was absolutely caressing in her manner to Nanny and Nell. She kept them as much as possible with her, in what were, metaphorically, the \"high places\" of the scene, she would not consent to lose sight of them, following them as she did with the tokens of an accomplished hostess's special favour. Aliss Newton must join this tennis set, a \" scratch \" set, the best got up that morning, the Viscountess was sure Aliss Newton was a good player. Aliss"], [181, "A DAY MARKED WITH A WHITE STONE. 171 Nell Newton must not tire herself with wander ing over the gardens, she must come and rest, and allow her Ladyship to have the pleasure of talking with her. Perhaps, she would like to see over the house by and by. There was not much to be seen at present, unfortunately, but one could judge of the capabilities. The Viscoun tess had heard Aliss Nell Newton was a brilliant musician, and she could tell her of a delicious old spinnet \u2014 on which it was said Queen Charlotte had played \u2014 in the music room; and there was an ancient silver gilt cup which could be hunted for in the plate chest, it matched the grotesque salt-cellars. They were all heirlooms and curios ities of goldsmiths' work, dating further back than her Ladyship liked to say. Lady Gosforth had always been kind to the Newtons, but she had never been so kind as to day, when she took them under her wing, asso ciated herself with them more conspicuously than with the Wentworths, presented them to the best people, made much of them, and let other guests see she made much of them, in her old-fashioned, brisk, friendly way. Air. Peregrine Saville hugged himself on this sign of attachment from Lady Gosforth. He was accustomed to say he lived like a hermit, but he kept himself well posted up in the news of the"], [182, "172 A BUBBLE FORTUNE. day, particularly with reference to what happened in his circle. He was aware of something which concerned Lady Gosforth, with which the New tons were unacquainted, which would not have struck them as of any consequence to them, even if they had heard it. The nephew of Lady Gos forth, for whom it was understood she destined the savings of her long dowagerhood, had come unexpectedly into so very large a fortune, that any bequest his aunt could make to him would be but as a drop in the overflowing ocean of his prosperity. It might be presumed that Lady Gosforth was too sensible a woman to waste the small fruits of her economies on a recipient who could not want them, neither did her other rela tives want them. What was to hinder them from coming to the Newton girls? Harry basked in the more genial atmosphere while he accepted it unquestioningly. He was soon the prey of the dowTagers, for whom he was prepared to spend himself. \" I wonder if I was right in doing my best to keep him from fetching and carrying for them? \" Nanny asked herself with some heart-searching. \" There ! I hear he has been undertaking to ride to Atherney one day next week, to take Airs. Vane Garney's bracelet, with her very parti cular instructions to the jeweller. And father has"], [183, "A DAY MARKED WITH A WHITE STONE. 173 agreed to look in, at the same time, at the rail way station, to see if Mrs. Barret's little nephews and nieces arrive with their nurses, and to put them into a safe fly, with a driver who can be trusted. I wonder, since her carriage is engaged, she does not propose him to have his waiting! Why do their husbands, sons and servants not go on their errands? Well, he enjoys it, and, perhaps I was wrong to seek to prevent it, for it might have been safer and better for him all round. It was my pride for father, I could not bear him to be a tame cat in houses, the masters of which are not half so true and good as he is.\" Nanny could not deny that, to be properly appreciated, was agreeable, though she said it was too late, and it might be too dearly bought. She was quite aware it was something, which was in the nature of a well-bred, complacent bribe, on the part of the county administered to be nefit members of their order. As for Nell, how could she fail to be enchanted with everybody so kind? She was at liberty to stroll in that exquisite old garden with which, in this month of May, no modern garden could compare. She wore the pretty heliotrope costume and shady hat, the perfect taste and becomingness of which she and Nanny had taken such pains to insure, with complete success, as not her"], [184, "174 A BUBBLE FORTUNE. mirror alone, but the eyes in which she could not look for more than three seconds, because they seemed as if they would devour her, told her. They were not bold, audacious eyes \u2014 far from it \u2014 they were reverent and humble. The owner of these eyes was by her side at every moment he could spare from attending to the rest of his father's guests. For that matter, both he and Nell frequently forgot the company around them, and were conscious of nothing save them selves. The two stood, and sat and walked, a blissful pair, alone, as far as they were concerned, in a blissful world. \" Oh ! Nanny, it has been a happy day, \" Nell whispered to her sister, on their homeward drive. The communication was too sacred and sweet to be other than private and confidential. \" It is like \u2014 only ever so much better \u2014 what I thought life might be like, when we came to Newton- Hayes.\" Nanny was not surprised to hear it, she half expected to be told that Captain Perrv had proposed and been accepted.

NANNY and Nell had dined together in solitary state the day after the garden party at Briarley. Harry Newton had gone from home, a rare event for him, and was to stay away over the night. He had accompanied the Savilles, father and son, to Aldershot, to -witness a military spectacle, a great review, before a foreign sovereign. Captain Perry was interested in it, and he commanded facilities for enabling civilians to see it to the best advantage. Nanny was quite contented that her father should be under his guidance, as she would not have been if Harry had been making one in an expedition over which Air. Peregrine Saville presided. \"Cap tain Perry wall see that it is all right,\" she said to herself vaguely, not without a shrewd percep tion that her prospective brother-in-law might be a useful relation, and a half amused sense"], [187, "MILES NEWTON FROM BRISBANE. 177 that she was counting on his services betimes. Nell and Nanny had agreed to have their cof fee brought into the drawing-room. It was a beautiful moonlight night, and Nell, whom Nanny had accused of a decided tendency to \" mooning \" within the last few weeks, prevented the curtains from being drawn. She was standing before the central long window, admiring the flood of silver light, and the fantastic shadows thrown by the fir trees on the lawn. Nanny was just on the point of asking her sister maliciously how long she was going to stand there, and whether she did not see a subtle connection between \" moon ing\" and \"spooning\", when she was stopped by Nell's remarking abruptly; \" I say, Nanny, I see a figure \u2014 a man's \u2014 gentle man's figure turning out of the avenue into the gravel sweep, who can it be at this hour ? \" \"One of the servants, I suppose, and not a gentleman, \" answered Nanny carelessly. But, as she spoke, an assured ring at the hall-door bell announced that it was neither a servant, nor a servant's visitor, who was seeking admission. Trifling as the occurrence was, the girls were startled. The knowledge that they were keeping house, for the night, without their father, all at once began to bulk largely in their minds. Presently Harry's bugbear \u2014 proper, precise old 12"], [188, "178 A BUBBLE FORTUNE. Braintree\u2014 the butler, knocked at the door and entered. There was a perplexed look on his round yet wrinkled face, and the slightest hesi tation in his formal speech. \" A gentleman wishes to see Air. Newton, \" he addressed Nanny. \" I a.,ked him for his card, but he said he had not got one. I told him Air. Newton was from home, and he said he must see one of the family. I have shown him into the library.\" \" Do you not know who the gentleman is? \" inquired Nanny, with what she felt, the next instant, was unaccountable and absurd trepidation. \" Did he ask for AIr. Newton or for the Squire, or the master of the house ? \" she added in the same breath. The bright idea flashed across her mind that the visitor might be a travelling ven dor of soap or steel pens, or an agent for a Charity, who chose, for reasons of his own, to call at an unseasonable time, and thought the chances of success in his application would be lessened if he told his errand to a servant. An impenetrable expression replaced the per plexed look on Braintree's rather stolid face, which had a broad nose, wide nostrils and a well-brushed up top of grizzled hair above his white neckcloth. The imperturbable expression was that of an"], [189, "MILES NEWTON FROM BRISBANE. 179 experienced, well-trained servant, who was about to say something not according to his notions of propriety, for which, however, he was not account able. \" What the gentlemen asked, Aliss, was ' Does Harry Newton live here ? ' \" \" Not a conventional style of address, \" said Nanny, with a faint smile and a heightened colour. \" What a rude man, unless he is a Quaker, \" cried Nell. \"A Quaker would have said ' Friend Newton, ' ' objected Nanny, \" but why should we stay dis cussing a stranger's manner of putting a ques tion? Tell the gentleman I'll see him presently,\" and Braintree, whose curiosity had been roused and was not appeased, departed reluctantly on his mission. \" Don't go, Nanny, \" entreated Nell, \" you don't know who the man is, or what he wants. He has no business to intrude into a house at this time of night.\" \" Nonsense, Nell, what harm could any man do me? It is barely past nine o'clock. He can not be aware that we are two unprotected fe males, save for Braintree, since I have no doubt Edward\" \u2014 naming the pantry boy \u2014 \"has either locked himself into his pantry, or retired to the village, with the view of improving his mind at the Institute.

Thus far reassured, the sisters descended to the library, but though they had seemed to settle one point to their satisfaction, they were \u2014 Nanny, as well as Nell \u2014 conscious of labouring under an amount of repressed excitement. It would have been difficult to understand it, apart from a premonition of trouble, had it not been for the long-established quiet habits and regular hours of the family, and for the unusual circumstance of Harry's absence. Braintree had lit a reading-lamp in the library, so that, when Nanny entered the room, she saw, not by the romantic medium of ' a dusky twilight ' or a 'pale moonlight' but standing up, relieved against the lamp-light, a tall man in a travelling coat, with a cap in his hand, coat and cap in a style not quite familiar to her eyes. He, on his part, saw before him two pretty, graceful young women in evening dresses \u2014 simple and suitable for home wear, but unmis takably evening dresses \u2014 which showed their round white arms encircled by a bracelet or two, and enough of their plump, fair, young necks, to af ford a fitting resting-place for the gleaming neck laces which Harry had given his daughters on their first birthdays after he came into his inheri tance. He liked to see the necklaces worn constantly, and so they appeared every evening."], [192, "182 A BUBBLE FORTUNE. The vision dazzled the stranger for a second, and caused him to stare in silence. \"You wished to see my father \u2014I am sorry he is from home, \" Nanny broke the awkward silence, speaking courteously but a little stiffly, for the visitor's presence and pertinacity were more perplexing than ever. It was a relief to find that he was not a ghost from the past, out of harmony with the present, and out of season anyhow. But, if he was not Alayor Coppock, or Air. Pring, or Bertie Coxe forgetting him self, who was he? He was not a traveller for soap or steel pens, he was not the agent for an hospital or a penitentiary. He looked too big, well-dressed and unconcerned for either of these rules. He was not like a genteel beggar on his own account. He was not becking and bowing before the girls. He had not a travelling bag open, in readiness, to display his uncoveted wares; nor a memorandum book \u2014 the pages inscri bed with testimonials and subscription lists \u2014 held in one hand, while the fingers of the other twirled a massive pencil-case \u2014 it might be of gold, or it might be of silver or even nickel, but it was bound to be massive. Nanny's words recalled the stranger to his object in being there. \"Yes, I was told so,\" he said, calmly, in a voice which had a slight ring"], [193, "MILES NEWTON FROM BRISBANE. 183 of authority in it, and was otherwise the voice of an educated man, accustomed to command himself and to be at ease in any company. \" Harry Newton's daughters, I presume,\" and he bowed with perfect politeness, as the natural accompani ment to his words. \"Yes,\" answered Nanny, unable to escape a ludicrous recollection of Stanley's greeting to Livingstone. But she knew what became Harry Newton's representative and the mistress of the house, and she preserved her gravity. She had not to ask in return: \"Who are you?\" for she heard forthwith without the slightest circumlocution. \" I am Aliles Newton from Brisbane, I landed in England yesterday, \" said the gentleman, in the most straightforward uncompromising, but entirely friendly, tone. \"Aliles Newton?\" repeated Nanny, in a bewil dered way, and then she recognized that the inopportune visit had, probably, more complicated motives, and would doubtless last longer than she had anticipated. \" Pray sit down, \" she said as civilly as she could manage to say it, in the midst of her incredulous astonishment. She took a seat herself and Nell followed her example. Nanny could see that her sister was as thunder struck as herself, else she would have been sure to have asked, with interest, if the speaker was any"], [194, "184 A BUBBLE FORTUNE. relation of theirs, and to express her fear lest he should be very tired, after a railway journey on the back of a long voyage. Nanny had certainly heard her father talk frequently of a kinsman named \"Aliles \", who was with him, or, rather, with his father, during Harry's boyhood in Australia; she had heard Harry tell, in detail, what he remembered of the family connections, on the memorable day in the Coxe's office when Air. Westmacott had brought the news that Air. Coxe's senior clerk was heir to Newton-Hayes. But so far as she could recall the particulars of the conversation the \"Aliles Newton\" there alluded to, though he was her grandfather's nephew and her father's cousin, had been as old as her grandfather, and must now, if he were alive, be more than three score and ten; more than that, she had a clear apprehension that he and his young sons had all died in an epidemic of fever, many years before. These contradictions darted into Nanny's mind while she was conscious, without looking across the library table, that the man, calling himself \"Miles Newton\", was in the prime of life, certainly not more than forty years of age, strong and active-looking. He was in the act of saying deliberately, as it he comprehended that his hearers had not accepted"], [195, "MILES NEWTON FROM BRISBANE. 185 his statement: \"I am Aliles Newton, your father's cousin once removed.\" He did not look like an impostor. He was well, if plainly, dressed and bore himself with the unaffected freedom and independence of a man who respected himself, and was accustomed to be respected by his neighbours. He might not have all the conventional signs of a man born and bred to a superior social standing, but his whole aspect was that of a man of weight men tally and morally, a man of more than ordinary intelligence and worth. Still, Satan will masquerade as an angel of light, and the race of impostors is by no means extinct. It was not yet a quarter of a century since the Claimant had gulled a credulous public. This so-called \" Aliles Newton \" might, after all, bear a greater resemblance in his antecedents to Arthur Orton than to Henry Stanley. Nanny rose to the encounter, she drew up her small figure and looked the very embodiment of a miniature magistrate. Transparent truth and right reason, were on her side. \" It is impossible,\" she said didactically. \" There is some mistake. Aly father's cousin Aliles would be a very old man if he were alive \u2014 as it is, he died in Australia many years ago.\" \" Pardon me, there is no mistake,\" said the so-"], [196, "186 A BUBBLE FORTUNE. called Aliles Newton, without flinching. \"I am the son and namesake of the Aliles Newton you refer to, I told you I was Harry Newton's cousin once removed.\" He reminded her with good humoured patience rather than defiance. Nanny had not noticed the qualification, but it did not seem to signify in the general incorrectness of the assertion. \" Aliles Newton \u2014 the 'Aliles New ton' I mean \u2014 left no sons,\" she said firmly. \" His sons \u2014 there were more than one I believe \u2014 died in childhood, at the same time as himself, all of fever.\" \" Don't you think, Nanny, you must have been misinformed, father, or somebody, must have been misled?\" interposed gracious Nell, speaking hur riedly and incoherently. She was distressed on account of hurting the stranger's feelings by seem ing to doubt his word. \" This gentleman ought to know his own name and origin \u2014 don't you think0 \" The stranger was neither vexed nor put out. He looked half tickled, half touched, by beauti ful Nell's disinterested championship \u2014 how disin terested she little guessed! Even Nanny had lost sight of any selfish grounds for questioning the alleged relationship. \" You are right,\" he said, addressing Nell specially, with a smile which lit up his somewhat lined face. \" I am Aliles Newton, while I belong to the younger generation. But nobody was"], [197, "MILES NEWTON FROM BRISBANE. 187 misinformed as to the facts of my father and my elder brothers' deaths, I was born later, after my father's death. Aly mother married again and I was brought up by my stepfather.\" \" Aly father never heard of your existence, \" urged Nanny, speaking in the plainest, most unvarnished terms. \" I daresay not, and it was neither his fault nor mine, \" replied Aliles Newton quietly. \" I un derstand your grandfather, who was my grand uncle, made some inquiries, but that was before I came into the world. There had been a coolness between the uncle and nephew, the original settlers, though I have reason to judge my father and your grandfather parted on amicable terms. Aly mother could not forget the coolness, she did not care to revive the intercourse by letter \u2014 local posts were not a very rapid nor a very secure mode of communication in the colony in those days \u2014 I can imagine she did not trouble to an nounce my birth while she was still in deep distress. Certainly, after she married again, she was averse to renew the intercourse with your grandfather. She was under the impression, I have come to the conclusion, that it was like applying to him for assistance on my behalf, whereas my stepfather was ready and willing to charge himself with my maintenance, and to launch mein life.\""], [198, "188 CHAPTER XIII. THE RAILWAY MAN AND HIS ACHIEVEMENTS. NANNY was staggered, each explanation sounded possible and natural, and was so far corroborated by what she had heard her father mention, that they could not be deliber ately-concocted falsehoods; but were they cun ning inventions made, on the spur of the moment, to fit in with what the speaker knew of the family history ? Nell was sitting, evidentlv very uncomfortable and unhappy. It was dreadful, to her mind, that she and Nanny should behave in this very dis trustful and unkind manner to a cousin \u2014 even if no more than a second cousin of her father's, still he might be his nearest surviving relative after his daughters. She had a notion that the hospitality of the bush was unbounded in its patriarchal simplicity, and here was this gentle man, just landed in England, come straight to his"], [199, "THE RAILWAY MAN AND HIS ACHIEVEMENTS. 189 kinsman's house and hardly invited to sit down in it ! Yet how could Nanny and she, who were all alone, and were not even sure that he was the man he said he was, bid him take up his quarters with them. He seemed to see their dilemma without re senting it. He rose and said, \" I shall come back to-morrow, when your father will be at home \u2014 your servant said. I ought to apologize for in truding upon ladies at this hour, but I thought I had better leave a message with you, for Harry Newton, and so announce my arrival at least. Perhaps you will be so good as to tell me, wmat train stops at your little station, which will take me back in a direct or round-about line to Alillthorpe, where I had lunch. I am an experienced traveller, well used to knocking about,\" he added, with a cheerful philosophy, which had a benevolent purpose under its nonchalance. \"Let me wish you good evening.\" He made a movement as if to shake hands, and then checked himself with a doubt, which clearly struck him in an almost whimsical light, whether his cousins might not object. \"Poor young souls!\" he was saying to himself compassionately, \" one of them, the little one, apprehends danger of some kind, and she is ready to make a fight for her father.\" Then Nell took the initiative, and waived aside"], [200, "190 A BUBBLE FORTUNE. the slight motion ofthe strong supple hand towards her and her sister, she rose in agitation while she stared hard at Nanny beseeching her for her support. \"There is no train stops at Hayes station be fore the seven o'clock train, to-morrow morning, \" she said with a gasp of distress. \" Then I shall walk to the next station, \" said Air. Aliles Newton composedly. \"Lucky it is a fine night, none of the drizzling fogs I was prepared for.\" \"The next station is twelve miles off,\" Nell shot out the words with an agonized jerk, still staring at Nanny. \"Twelve miles on macadamised roads are a bagatelle \u2014 a little gentle exercise for a fair walker,\" he tried to reassure her smilingly. \" But you have had nothing to eat since lunch \" cried Nell, \" you must be quite faint, we have just dined, but that is of no consequence,\" and she looked again at Nanny with urgent entreaty and keen upbraiding. \" Don't worry, I am not given to faintness, \" said her cousin, with another of the frank smiles, under the influence of which, what was hard in the muscles of his face relaxed agreeably. \" To fast from a good luncheon to a good supper is nothing, to a man who has tramped all day in the bush on a lump of damper and a can of tea, without cream or sugar.\""], [201, "THE RAILWAY MAN AND HIS ACHIEVEMENTS. I 9 I \" That may be, but my sister is right, \" said Nanny, recovering her speech and at once deciding the question. \" You must allow me to send in a tray here with whatever you care to take.\" \"Thanks, I do not care to take anything,\" he said, with equal resolution, like a man accustomed to have his way, \" unless you will be so good as to give me a cup of tea. It requires no great insight to predict, beforehand, that it will be an improvement on the bush tea I have been accus tomed to brew for myself, of which I was speak ing.\" She could not refuse him the tea or their company, which she was sensible he had bargained for, while he drank it. She rang and ordered the coffee, for which she and Nell had been waiting in the drawing-room, to be brought, with the addition of tea, into the library. This was still farther to the mystification and pique of Braintree, who knew nothing of the claim of kinship proferred by the stranger. Notwithstanding the repressed excitement and displeasure of Braintree, who considered himself in a measure responsible, in his master's absence, for the breach of propriety, the party of three thawed a little under the spell of the cup which cheers but does not inebriate. Nanny could not fill up the intruder's cup and Nell could not suffer him to"], [202, "192 A BUBBLE FORTUNE. hand her a biscuit without feeling a little less strange and embarrassed, a little more friendly. He, on his part, was not unwilling to enter into conversation. He spoke well as he told, with what was simply natural eloquence, the effect the first sight of England had produced on him, and contrasted a highly cultivated, shut in, nice place, like theirs of Newton-Hayes, with the great stretches of untenanted, unenclosed land, well nigh as free as the sky above it, to which he had been largely accustomed. Some of his personal history, which he had evidently no thought of concealing, came out in the course of his talk. He was unmarried. He had not even a half brother or sister. His mother and stepfather were both dead. Yes, his profession was natur ally a great deal to him \u2014 it was that of a civil engineer. He had projected and carried out several lines in the Colony. He had also acted as their pioneer in some quarters. He had trav elled, with one or two companions, for many weeks at a time, on what sounded more like daring adventures, than mere hardy enterprises, in tra versing great tracks of the vast continent. He was perfectly unassuming in his narrative, and never made himself the hero of his tale when he could help it. But even a couple of tyros could see that this was a man endowed with"], [203, "THE RAILWAY MAN AND HIS ACHIEVEMENTS. I 93 exceptional activity and originality of mind, and force of character, a man fit to carve out a career spontaneously, involuntarily, almost without plan ning or thinking of it, a man whom other men, moving in the same groove, would listen to, defer to, and trust. This big brick-red man was thoroughly uncon ventional, but it was evident enough that he had cultivated himself to the best of his opportunities. He could not be called a rough diamond, for there was no roughness about him, though he was simplicity itself. He had a gift of unstud ied eloquence \u2014 which he had often not been able to exercise, for long intervals \u2014 all the more, like most people who speak easily and well, and are not cursed with self-consciousness, he liked to speak to a fit audience. He was pleased by the interest with which Harry Newton's two beautiful young daughters listened to him, though he was a man of forty, and they were girls barely in their twenties. He had the singular freshness and ready receptivity of faculty, which, when found at all, is mostly met with in men who have led more or less solitary lives and have been continually thrown back on nature for companionship. He impressed others, because of his own susceptibi lity to impressions. This was due to the survi val of a plasticness of mind and capacity for 13"], [204, "A BUBBLE FORTUNE. 194 being quickly arrested and keenly interested \u2014 to the point of enthusiasm, which one is more wont to associate with the exuberant vitality of youth than with the sober sedateness of middle-age. It was on this one side \u2014 of an abiding vein of youthfulness \u2014 that there was the slightest strain of resemblance between Harry and Aliles Newton. And the strain was exhibited in forms, so widely contrasted, that it was only intimate knowledge of the two men that would serve to detect what might mean a germ of heredity derived from squire and yeoman forefathers, common to both, and, meanwhile, turned in nearly opposite directions. There was no outward likeness between the cousins, perhaps it would have been unreason able to look for it, in comparatively distant relations who had passed through very different experiences. Both men were well grown and well looking, Harry being decidedly the handsomer on the surface. The growth of the younger was that of muscle and sinew, strung to the utmost tenseness consistent with elasticity ; and the growth of the elder was the large-framed, amply-nourished, goodly bulk of a sound body, in which dwelt a tranquil mind. There was no waste from worry or overwork or a self-imposed burden of re sponsibility on Harry's part. Lately there had"], [205, "THE RAILWAY MAN AND HIS ACHIEVEMENTS. 195 not even been the check of sufficient exercise and constitutional temperance, with the compulsory avoidance of over-indulgence in the good things of the table, to lessen the tendency to over growth and its resulting unwieldiness. Harry Newton had been in his youth and early manhood, a fine animal, from the animal point of view, but if he did not take care, or if some drag were not applied to him, without his will having anything to do with it, in the course he had entered upon, he would soon be a fine animal no longer. Miles Newton's good looks, though there was no strong objection to be made to the tolerable regularity of his features \u2014 his good nose, his not so good mouth, his hazel eyes, rarely without an element of intentness in their gaze \u2014 belonged largely to the manly worth, honest cand\u00abmr and restrained power in every lineament. He owed nothing to colouring. Between much exposure to an Australian sun and the salt breezes of his recent voyage, his skin was not far removed in tint and texture from the copper or brick-red which marks the aborigines of the mighty island of which he was one of the latest products. Harry Newton's handsome elderly face (very unlike another elderly face, evilly handsome, in whose company Harry's was often seen) had always shown the perfection of moulding and"], [206, "196 A BUBBLE FORTUNE. colouring, delicate, not with waxen delicacy^, but with the healthy peach-bloom of Nell's complexion. \" Nanny, what is your opinion of him ? \" asked Nell, breathlessly, after the visitor was gone and the sisters were together in the drawing-room again. \" If he is our cousin, of which I suppose there can be no question, don't you think he will be a great acquisition, when he is in this country, for I am afraid he will not stay long in England. I call him very clever and agreeable and so nice in not showing up our \u2014 I should say my \u2014 ignorance, and so good-natured in taking the trouble to enlighten us about the antipodes. Father will be delighted, and I do think Captain Perry will like him. Won't the new cousin be an acquisition?\" \" I don't know, I can't say, \" answered Nanny, still with a startled, abstracted air. \" Why, Nanny, you don't mean that you doubt him, that you don't consider him a gentleman ? \" remonstrated Nell. \"Of course he is a gentleman, and a good deal more than a gentleman,\" answered Nanny, waking up to the remonstrance and speaking impatiently. \" He is a man in his strength. It was good to listen to him, as one only feels when there is something both of goodness and greatness in the speaker. I am sure that man"], [207, "THE RAILWAY MAN AND HIS ACHIEVEMENTS. 197 has done wonderful things, though he spoke as if they were the most ordinary doings in the world.\" \" Well, you know, after all he is only a ' railway man' and pioneer \u2014 whatever that may be,\" objected loyal Nell, beginning to feel jealous for her soldier. \" And I think, \" maintained Nanny in her un usual excitement, \" that a man may be said to have done wonderful things, yes, and beautiful things, who has opened out paths in the wilderness, made room for the crowded-out dwellers in the great cities and the old countries, and brought prosper ity deserving of the name, with all the joy of human intercourse, to outlying isolated log-houses far in the rolling plains. I don't know that anyr one of the old English Newtons ever did half so much for his fellows. The family had to go to the ends of the earth and be squatters, pioneers, and 'railway men' before they could develop into public benefactors. It struck me in listening to Mr. Aliles Newton, that, in a man of this kind, you do not ask if he is a gentleman, because you know he must be, unless your notion of gentle breeding is of the most conventional, arti ficial kind. I should not be astonished if he were one of those men of whom the old prophets and seers said, that, beginning poor and obscure, their place is with princes before they die.\" \"I am so glad to hear you say so,\" cried Nell,"], [208, "198 A BUBBLE FORTUNE. carried away by Nanny's fervour, coming round to her opinion and speaking in perfect good faith. \" Do you know what I was thinking, when he was talking? He was full of his subject, his heart was in it, anybody could see, yet he was not too much engrossel with it to have eyes and ears for other people's hobbies. He did not fail to ad mire our library, with its alcoves, its fine editions of standard books and its rare old prints. He looked so manly and strong and yet sympathe tic, ready and fit to be depended upon. What I did think was, how charming it would have been if he had turned out to be an unknown elder brother instead of only a cousin.\" \"Ah, yes, if he had but been a brother, and not a cousin, \" acquiesced Nanny with unexpected empressement and a long-drawn sign. Then she laughed and protested with equal impetuosity, \" What nonsense we are talking, Nell. The man is not so very much younger than father, I ima gine there is not more than twelve or fifteen years difference in their ages \u2014 though he, too, looks one of those people who will never grow old. And how can we desire him for a brother, when we have not spent an hour in his company? He may have the worst temper in the world and be the most difficult person to live with, even though he is neither knave nor fool.\""], [209, "199 CHAPTER XIV. JULES NEWTON'S CREDENTIALS. HARRY NEWTON could not believe his ears when, on his return home, his daughters poured into them an account of what had happened the previous evening. He was a man slow to receive an idea or to follow up an argument. Of course it was just possible that his cousin Aliles had left a posthumous son, though Harry's father, in another part of the Colony, had not been aware of the fact. He had not then amassed the fortune which had melted away as quickly as it was heaped up. He had been too much engaged and troubled about his own affairs, to institute very searching inquiries after his nephew's widow, though he would have done his best to help her if she had been within his reach. Later, when he heard she had married a second time, and that fairly well for a settler at a new station, he had dismissed her from his thoughts, while their paths in life had not again crossed."], [210, "A BUBBLE FORTUNE. 200 So far Harry had pursued the record of the past without any foreboding of disaster, but by degrees another consideration stole in upon him, and brought with it an amount of agitation and dismay, strange to a man of his calm temperament, who had hitherto declined to be elated by the smiles, even as he had, with the same easy philo sophy^, disarmed the frowns, of fortune. He had been happy enough before he was summoned from one sphere to another. He had not sought out his prospective inheritance, or felt as if he coveted it or wanted it very much. He had not found it a bed of roses after he got it. But that was quite another thing from being required to relinquish it, at a moment's notice; from being called upon, for a second time in his life, to renounce the habits of a man of position and affluence, and to resume toil for daily bread. He had learnt the acquired habits, with the sloth and self-indulgence they may entail, more thoroughly during the last twelve months, than he had done in the six or eight years, when he was a rich colonist's son, in his y^outh and early manhood. Yet, at whatever cost, the truth must be recognized. If \"Aliles Newton from Brisbane\" was, as he had represented, Harry Newton's cousin once removed, the son of the first Aliles Newton and the grand nephew of Harry's father John, the new-comer"], [211, "MILES NEWTON'S CREDENTIALS. 201 was the descendant of the elder branch of the Huntingdonshire family, and the heir of Newton- Hayes. The estate which had gone a-begging had journeyed in a wrong direction. Under the sharp pricks of the alarm which had seized on him, Harry did about the wisest thing he could have done, under the circumstances. He sent post-haste, not for his friend Mr. Pere grine Saville, but for the old family lawyer, Mr. Westmacott, before Aliles Newton, if there was a Aliles Newton who was a second cousin of Harry's, could reappear on the scene. It did not require half a dozen sentences, far less a score of idle exclamations following on a nervous groping in the fog of early recollections, to arouse Mr. Westmacott to the significance of the incident. \" Good heavens ! iny dear sir, Air. Aliles Newton, if he is not a man of straw, is the great-grand son of your grandfather's elder brother,\" cried the lawyer, wiping his forehead, though the day was not hot, and frowning heavily. He had been much gratified by his own discernment in discov ering, in Harry Newton, a clerk to a solicitor in Foxchester, the heir to Air. Westmacott's former patrons at Newton-Hayes. He had regarded the discovery as a well-deserved tribute to his skill as a genealogist, and hunter-up of the missing"], [212, "202 A BUBBLE FORTUNE. links in a pedigree. He felt his professional honour touched, his legal character impugned, by the starting into life, at this date, of another and a rival Newton, of whose existence Air. West macott had not so much as heard, though he was quite cognizant of the life and death of an elder Aliles and that he had issue in the persons of the little lads who died along with their father. But who and what was this younger Aliles, this undreamed of, unsuspected son of the dead man, if there was any truth in his story? Apart from Air. Westmacott's natural partiality for his version of the succession, apart also from his sincere liking for this man, the squire in pos session, who was a good fellow, though somewhat trying in his amazing simplicity, the revelation was a severe blow to a highly respectable pro fessional man \u2014 to whom to make a grave mistake in his deductions, so as to mislead grievously a client, an innocent man, was gall and wormwood. \" Do you mean, \" said Harry, asking in a dazed, stupid tone, a question which he had already answered for himself, \" that my cousin's son can turn me out of the property here ? \" \" I am afraid he can, sir, if he can prove that he is your second cousin, \" said Air. Westmacott, almost testily, in the depth of his sympathy and vex ation. \" But if there has been a serious wrong done,"], [213, "MILES NEWTON'S CREDENTIALS. 203 if there is disappointment to face, and trouble all round, who is most to blame for it ? I put it to you candidly, who would expect that a man should be in complete ignorance of the very existence of another man who was, as it happened, one of his nearest relations ? What could have possessed your father that he did not make the future secure by tracing, beyond mistake, his nephew's fate and whether he left a child? But it is always the way ; one would think the people who are responsible are criminally, yes, criminally careless, on purpose to leave those who come after them at a disadvantage.\" Then Air. West macott cooled down a little and was heartily ashamed of his petulance. \" I beg your pardon, Mr. Newton, you must excuse an old servant of the family. I'm a hasty-tempered old fellow. I'm speaking of the divisions of Australia as if they were so many English country parishes. No doubt the individual, who is upsetting all our beliefs, is some adventurer who is following up a mare's nest. He need not be a rogue, he may only be a simpleton, some other Miles Newton \u2014 neither of the names is very uncommon \u2014 with whom you have nothing to do, save that he has heard of your English inheritance, and has talked himself and other people into the conviction that he is of the same stock. He must produce"], [214, "204 A BUBBLE FORTUNE. evidence, and show his papers, before we are bound to pay any heed to his tale.\" Air. Westmacott was still speaking, when the hall-door bell rang, and Aliles Newton was shown into the library where Harry and the lawyer were holding their consultation. After one keen glance at the stranger the agent's face fell once more. This was no sim pleton, neither had he the physiognomy and bearing of a rascal. He and Harry confronted each other for an instant in silence. If there is any mysterious stirring of kindred blood when parents and children, brothers and sisters who have grown up strangers to each other, meet for the first time, the movement cannot be supposed to extend to second cousins. Both of them knew perfectly the important item in the asserted relationship (of which Nanny had only entertained a faint conjecture the previous evening, while Nell was in blissful ignorance of it) that they were opposing claimants for the possession of Newton-Hayes. They had each the man's in stinct, Harry of keeping what he had got, Aliles of asserting his right \u2014 his prior right \u2014 to the house and lands of their common ancestors. After the single instant's pause, when he had kept his hands in his pockets, Harry's habitual urbanity^ gained the victory over his dogged dis-"], [215, "MILES NEWTON'S CREDENTIALS. 205 like to the whole affair. \" On the chance of your being my cousin, sir, as you say, and no doubt believe, you are, \" Harry spoke politely but stiffly, \" I am bound to give you a friendly greeting and welcome.\" Miles Newton took the hand \u2014 grown soft and white \u2014 which Harry offered in his firm strong fingers without a second invitation. \" I am your cousin, Harry Newton, and if I had not come in a friendly spirit and in fair fight, Newton- Hayes would not have been my first destination after landing in England. I might have put the machinery of the law in motion without giving you warning beforehand. I might have kept you in the dark, to the last moment, as to the proofs I had to establish my claim. On the contrary I am prepared to lay them before you.\" On Harry's formal invitation Miles Newton sat down, with the master of the house and the man of business, at the library table, took out his pocket-book, spread out its contents, and as far as his companions could judge, proceeded to speak in the most straightforward manner. He told how he came to know of the death of the last Newton of Newton-Hayes, in the direct line, from a chance paragraph in an English local newspaper, which he happened to look over. The paragraph not only mentioned that"], [216, "206 A BUBBLE FORTUNE. an heir had been found in the person of a Air. Harry Newton \u2014 who was in a lawyer's office in the market town of Foxchester, and had been unacquainted with what was in store for him \u2014 the writer gave a summary of the links by which the heirship was established. He traced the Alountshire squires in their ramifications as Huntingdonshire yeomen and Australian squat ters. This announcement had put the son of an Australian squatter, whose name was Newton and who was not entirely ignorant of his ante cedents, on the scent. He showed what evidence he had in his possession and what further evi dence he could bring forward to corroborate his words. He could produce the certificate of his baptism under his father's full name. The offici ating clergyman was dead, but he could summon witnesses who would swear to his hand-writing. From his mother, Aliles Newton had learnt many details of the emigration of the elder New tons which nobody, unconnected with the family, was likely to know. He had, with his luggage, a family Bible, which his father and mother had carried with them to Australia, which, appar ently, they had not liked to leave behind them when they removed from one district to another. On a fly-leaf within the boards, there was writ ten, according to an old custom, a record of the"], [217, "MILES NEWTON'S CREDENTIALS. 207 births, marriages and deaths in the family, be ginning at a date two hundred years back. (A piece of information over which Air. Westmacott pricked longing antiquarian ears.) The style of \" Newton of Newton-Hayes \" was that given to the owners of the first four names. All had been written by the bearers of the names, in the hand-writing of each, and inserted in due order. So much for what was actually in Miles New ton's hands and carried full conviction to himself. But, as he observed quietly, there remained the possibility to others that he might have purloined the papers and stolen the Bible. He might not be the Miles Newton descended from these pro genitors. He therefore gave several addresses to which he proposed Harry Newton, or his lawyer, should telegraph, in order to gain further infor mation. One was that of the manager at the main office of a great engineering centre, another was that of the chief magistrate of the township in which he, Aliles Newton, had been born, where his step-father, Alfred Arkell and his wife, Aliles Newton's mother, had dwelt for many yrears and where they had ultimately died. A third was that of the firm of bankers with whom Aliles Newton dealt, a fourth and fifth were those of well-known business men in Alelbourne and Sidney, cities with which Englishmen might be better acquainted"], [218, "208 A BUBBLE FORTUNE. than with the rising local towns. It amounted to this, Aliles Newton was willing that Harry Newton or his agents should telegraph or write to any quarter where the speaker was likely to be known. He was pretty well known in various districts of Australia, he said modestly, while he craved leave, with a humorous twinkle in his eyes, to remind his hearers that Australia was not England. Aliles Newton showed himself more ready and willing to submit to any private, personal cross examination than AIr. Westmacott, far less Harry, was prepared to start it. Like others, in their situation, they were disposed to reserve their ques tions to a more advanced stage of the contest. The next gratuitous proceeding on Air. Aliles Newton's part was to point out, with perfect frankness as it sounded, what was lacking in his chain of proof, and what he proposed to do to supply the deficiency, if an easier method did not present itself. Apart from the record in the Bible, he had not any attestation of the baptisms and marriages of his father and grandfather, the latter of whom was Harry's uncle. He \u2014 Aliles Newton \u2014 had been told by his mother that some family papers had been left by her first husband in charge of John Newton, when John's nephew had quitted Red Rock Falls for good and all."], [219, "MILES NEWTON'S CREDENTIALS. 209 Miles Newton stopped at this point and looked, with a direct appeal, at Harry, who was unable to keep a strain of sulkiness out of his voice in his answer that he knew nothing of these papers. He had still in his dressing-room an old travel ling-trunk which had always been supposed to hold some of his father's papers. He had lugged it about with him, much as the relatives of the gentleman, to whom he was speaking, must have lugged their family Bible. The trunk had first reached him when he was on the eve of leaving Oxford, after the crash at Red Rock Falls and his father's death, some thirty years before. He had made a cursory inspection of the contents of the trunk on its arrival, when, to the best of his recollection he had found them to consist of old accounts and business letters, which were of no use to anybody. He knew he had kept the trunk with its contents intact \u2014 for a silly enough reason \u2014 simply because they had belonged to his father. Aliles Newton resumed his statement without betraying either surprise or disappointment. If the papers had happened to be irretrievably lost or accidentally destroyed, he said coolly, he had still the pages in the Bible. By the way, he would say \u2014 in connection with the reflection on his parents for having burdened themselves with 1 ."], [220, "210 A BUBBLE FORTUNE. the Bible, a heavy folio, as he could bear witness, while they left behind papers which were of con sequence to them \u2014 that was a choice pretty cer tain to be made, especially when there was a woman in question, a sentiment of reverence \u2014 some people might call it superstition \u2014 would cause her, in departing for a new home, to cling to the family Bible whatever else she left behind. The difficulty was that though the dates of the births and marriages were carefully given, there was an important omission which he had been told oc curred occasionally in these amateur jottings. By a curious abridgement, the places where the baptisms and marriages were solemnized, and the names of the officiating clergymen, were not sup plied. \" You are right,\" said Air. Westmacott, with professional emphasis, \"that omission is not un common and it is a grave flaw; in fact, in a legal point of view, it goes far to invalidate the whole document \u2014 supposing it could be established other wise. \" \" Still, you will allow the presumptive evidence,\" said Aliles \" and you will grant that to have the exact date is an immense help in instituting a search through the various parish registers, \" he finished with thc sagacity, which Air. Westmacott admitted despondently, looked out of the deep-set"], [221, "MILES NEWTON'S CREDENTIALS. 211 wide apart eyes, fixed upon him. \" I don't anticipate any great trouble in getting the certi ficates relating to my grandfather's baptism and marriage and that of my father's baptism, for I have ascertained their branch of the Newtons \u2014 your branch also,\" inclining his head to Harry \u2014 \" were then yeomen-farmers in Huntingdonshire, somewhere near St. Neots. It is the certificate of my father's and mother's marriage which may require some hunting up. They were both of them country born and bred, but, for some reason, they chose to be married in London, where my mother had well-to-do relatives. I think my father was even then thinking of emigrating, and wanted to be making inquiries at different agencies and offices quite as much as to be having a holiday. The couple stayed in town the requisite time for the purpose of the marriage. Aly mother was greatly taken up by her first visit to London, and was carried here and there by her friends to see the sights and have a taste of the gaieties, which did not tend to lessen her natural excite ment, under the circumstances, and the bewilder ment of a country-bred girl suddenly plunged into the noise and whirl of a great town.

She believed it was near one of the bridges, and she thought it was named either St. Alary 's or St. Alichael's \u2014 if it was not St. Catherine's. It was plain it was a London church to her and that was all.\" Air. Westmacott smiled grimly at the poor young bride's obliviousness ; even Harry laughed a short laugh. The discussion was dropped, since there was nothing further to be done till renewed inquiries were made, till the papers in Harry's keeping were examined afresh, and till Aliles Newton could produce the family Bible, to tell its own story of a once numerous and prosperous race, whose prosperity had undergone sundry fluctuations, which had dwindled down to the verge of extinction. It was settled that, in the course of the follow ing week \u2014 when Aliles Newton's mails would have arrived, and when the process of telegraphing\", which he had invited, was gone into and its results arrived at \u2014 there should be another meeting of the principals, and such allies as they liked to call in ; when a formal investigation of the papers in Harry Newton's hands ought to be made. Air. Westmacott was very unhappy, not only on his client's account but because his own pro-"], [223, "MILES NEWTON'S CREDENTIALS. 213 sessional character was at stake. The whole pro ceedings were horribly^ irregular. Harry's uncon cealed glumness was not the tone he was bound to assume, while Air. Aliles Newton's uncalled-for candour and irrepressible loquacity, as it appeared to Air. Westmacott, were equally improper. Air. Westmacott felt it absolutely incumbent upon him to offer two suggestions. First, he delicately hinted it might be better, to save all reflections, if the old travelling trunk with its contents was at once sought out and committed to the care of a neutral person. But Harry, who had been more or less stunned by the morning's work, did not seem to understand the gist of the proposal, and Aliles Newton \u2014 in spite of his keen eyes which looked as if they saw all round a subject \u2014 did not second the proposal. The lawyer's second suggestion was to the effect that Mr. Aliles Newton ought to furnish himself with a legal adviser, to be present on the next occasion of their meeting. But this advice the gentleman chiefly concerned frankly scouted \" I don't wish to go to law, \" he said, \" unless my cousin here particularly desires it. Aly notion is that the matter may be equita bly settled between ourselves. Newton-Hayes is a nice little place, but it is a bagatelle after all. \" The idea of reckoning Newton-Hayes a baga-"], [224, "A BUBBLE FORTUNE. 214 telle ! These colonists were levellers with a ven geance. \" It is a question of the justice of a title which even a blind man might see, and no honest man would dispute,\" declared the claimant tranquilly. \" The consequences of the man's rashness and wrong-headedness will be on his own head,\" Air. Westmacott told himself indignantly, and then he sought to relieve Harry Newton from the extreme awkwardness of either having to entertain at his table the pretender to his property, or of having to shut his door \u2014 as it were \u2014 in the face of a rela tion from a far country, who had come directly to him and made his claim in the most single hearted manner. It was really for Harry New ton's sake, and because, however much Air. West macott might deprecate, on principle, the gross impropriety7 in action, of this latest importation from Australia, it had to be owned that his behaviour was, so far, that of an honourable man who would not spring a mine on his antagonist, that the old lawyer came forward as he did. He might think later of expediency, but at this mo ment he had no plan for retaining the office of family lawyer whatever might befall. Air. West macott invited Air. Aliles Newton to accompany him back to Atherney and be his guest for the time; an invitation which was accepted."], [225, "CHAPTER XV. THE TEMPTER AND THE TEMPTED. FOR the moment Harry Newton did not care where the challenger of his title to Newton- Hayes went, whether with Mr. Westmacott or another. He \u2014Harry Newton \u2014 was longing to be rid of them both, and to be at liberty to think over the matter in his own way. Then, as ill luck would have it, in order to avoid rejoining his daughters and having at once to repeat to them what Aliles Newton had stated, Harry strolled, with his cigar in his mouth, down the avenue where the traces of the wheels of Mr. Westmacott's departing dog-cart were still fresh, and took inadvertently the familiar road to Briarley. He was not paying any attention to the direction in which he was going. His mind was full of the threatened changes. If this new man \u2014 this brick-red Colonial man \u2014 was, as he vouched, the son of the cousin Aliles, whom Harry 2'5"], [226, "216 A BUBBLE FORTUNE. had known when he himself was a lad, a dreamy unpractical man \u2014 certainly this fellow did not look either dreamy or unpractical \u2014 whose father was the elder brother of Harry's grandfather, there could not be two opinions of what would be the end. It was true enough that there was no call to go to law, since even a child could tell yrou that there was not a law-court in the world, which would not maintain the superior claim of the elder brother and his descendants. Thus Miles Newton, and not Harry, was the true heir of the old squires of Newton-Hayes and was bound to be the present squire. But how could Harry bear it? He had not been so happy in his new estate, he had found the time hang heavily on his hands, he had re ceived the cold shoulder from his fellow squires. But he had got climatized, naturalized. Only the other day he and his girls had been enjoying themselves with the best at Briarleyr. How was he to go back to the drudgery of office work, even if a man of his age could easily obtain a clerk's situation? And if he did not obtain it, what would become of his Nanny and Nell who had begun to take their proper place among their peers, his Nell, whose bright prospects had seemed so assured only fortyr-eight hours ago? To turn back to the old dull routine, the old narrow"], [227, "THE TEMPTER AND THE TEMPTED. 217 means, the old meagre fare (Harry called it meagre, as well as homely, to-day) why, the very cigar he was smoking would be forbidden to him, he would be condemned to the detestable make-shifts, which would be veritable dust and ashes in his mouth ! The weather had changed during the night and it had been a cold and showery morning. Harry was mechanically plodding along a muddy road, between dripping hedges, with his eyes on the ground, when the clatter of horses' hoofs caught his ear. He looked up in time to see that the horsemen, who were about to pass him, were Air. Peregrine Saville and a groom at his heels. Air. Peregrine had always contrived to retain not merely his personal comforts, but in addition, the attributes of his station. The horse he rode was a fine thorough-bred, his groom was in irre proachable livery. \" Hallo, Newton, \" cried the first rider, affably, \"are you taking a constitutional already? I need not speak, I felt so hipped by myself, with the habitations of men in town left behind me, that If was reduced to a gallop on my own account.

He was always hankering after companionship in whatever mood, but for some occult reason, which he himself could hardly have explained, he preferred, on the present occasion, that of a man and a brother versed in the ways of the world, to the society of Nanny and Nell. Straightway7, as might have been expected, with out waiting to be sounded on the cause of his abstracted, disordered air, the harassed man made a clean breast of his trouble to his astounded friend and patron. \" I say, Saville, a fellow7 has turned up from Australia, who calls himself a cousin of mine, descended from an older branch of the family, so that, if his story is true, he is the real owner of Newton-Hayes.\" \" Good Lord ! What a disaster, \" muttered Sa ville under his moustache, and he wound up with the inward comment, \" What an old idiot to tell the story to me, before that oaf Perry has fully committed himself!\" Aloud he said, after he had viciously bitten"], [229, "THE TEMPTER AND THE TEMPTED. 219 the well-shaped nails of his ungloved hand, \" Ain't it a cock-and-bull story, Newton, that some cur has got up in order to try and fleece you ? \" \" There was a nephew of my father's, about his own age, a Aliles Newton with a wife and children who went out to the Colony with us,\" said Harry gloomily. \" I recollect him quite well. I was a lad of eleven before they parted company with us, and went off, on their own hook, in the Adelaide direction. Aly father un derstood that, within the first two years, the man and his children were cut off by a fever which was prevalent, that only the woman was left, and that in course of time she married again.\" \" Depend upon it that was the way of it, \" said Air. Peregrine Saville quickly as he recov ered his assurance, \" and she told her story, hence this attempt at a gross imposition, proba bly by a full grown brat born to her second husband. You must look sharp, Newton, or you will be taken in to a certainty. Excuse me, my dear fellow, you are as innocent as a babe and as soft-hearted as a woman.\" \" He looks an honest fellow, indeed, rather a fine fellow,\" objected Harry despondently. \" He is a single man, I understand, not young and not old. He is a civil engineer, and if my girls\u2014 to whom he talked a good deal last night \u2014"], [230, "220 A BUBBLE FORTUNE. took him up correctly7, he has done wonders in his profession and is greatly attached to it. I cannot say that he bears a great resemblance to what I remember of my cousin Aliles, but I know that I have not much look of my father. Of course it is possible that there might have been a pos thumous child, without our hearing of it at the Red Rock Falls, and, hang it ! Saville, he would have been as nearly as possible the age of this fellow.\" \" Oh! never mind possibilities,\" cried the deeply interested listener, \" depend upon it the woman would have whined and sought to hang on your father, though the third of a continent lay be tween them,\" Other details were discussed, to the edification of Mr. Peregrine Saville. \" The old story7 ! \" he protested contemptuously, \" there is always a family Bible or an old tomb-stone or some such rot, to do duty in these apocry7phal cases and green the unwary7. But it does not suit to be too precise in these records, lest a charge of falsifi cation and perjury be brought in.

Rely7 upon it, old man, there was no marriage.\""], [231, "THE TEMPTER AND THE TEMPTED. 221 \"You are out there, Saville,\" said Harry, turn ing, with some heat, upon the accuser. \" Aly cousin's wife was an honest women, otherwise my father w7ould not have had her about the place, either before or after my mother's death.\" \" Your father might have believed her honest, \" said Saville with emphasis. \" I tell you that you're wrong,\" insisted Harry. \" I can recall her also \u2014 a proud, reserved sort of woman, who held herself apart, and kept her footing when she acted as mistress of the house and was the only7 white woman in the establish ment. She was always very good to me, I used to think, because I took to the little chaps \u2014 her boys \u2014 and they were fond of me in return. I have not forgotten wandering disconsolately in the scrub for half a day, when I first heard of their deaths. No, I really7 cannot hear a word said against the poor mother.\" \"Nevertheless, from your description, she was the very woman to be at the bottom of a plot, by which she would move heaven and earth to serve her sole surviving child, or, if he had bro thers and sisters, to benefit the entire troop,\" maintained her assailant stoutly. \" She and her first husband might have gone through some form of marriage which satisfied their consciences, particularly after they had written it down"], [232, "222 A BUBBLE FORTUNE. in that precious Bible of theirs. Or one of the two might have connived at a mock marriage and deceived the other \u2014 such little deceptions were still not altogether unheard of in those days,\" explained AIr. Peregrine Saville with half closed eyes, a tilt of his turned-up chin, and a faint smile of superior intelligence. He hastened to go on, however, lest he should outrage the prudish morality of a half-bred Philistine like Harry, \" Such a woman as you have painted, would die sooner than admit a faux pas to her son. Never tell me that a woman of the tvpe you represent, would commit the copy of her marriage certificate to her husband's care, or that she would be a party to his leaving it behind them, and not even take steps to reclaim it. Listen to me, Newton,\" Harry's confidant went on, speaking slowly and emphaticallv, \" that cer tificate is not, and never could have been, among the papers which your late father, or his executors, consigned to y7our keeping.\" Then, as Harry stared in utter blankness at this confident assertion, the privileged adviser, with a quick shrug of his shoulders, assailed his victim on another tack, \" Look here, my friend, you must not trust to your own resources, you must have a quali fied lawyer to look after y7our interests, sift the matter to the bottom or, better still, quash it in its birth. \""], [233, "THE TEMPTER AND THE TEMPTED. 223 \" Didn't I tell you I sent for Westmacott at once?\" mentioned Harry, with a faint satisfaction at having been found alert and discreet. \" But this Miles Newton does not wish to go to law, if he can convince me and my friends that his claim is valid.\" \" Deucedly impertinent, and decidedly suspici ous, on the part of this newly-found relation,\" said Saville, with his languid sneer. He roused himself to greater animation the next minute. \"But let me warn you, Newton, Westmacott is no good. I know him of old, a strait-laced antiquated fogey. You must have more modern and sharper metal to cut the tangle ; set a thief to catch a thief, eh ? I can recommend my London lawy7er, though Perry has a stupid, squeamish aversion to him. He is worth something, has all the scoundrelly tricks of the trade at his finger ends, and is up to any number of dodges.\" \" Thanks, \" answered Harry, not without a shortness of tone, in spite of his propensity to think no evil, and at the same time to cherish evil-doers. Air. Peregrine Saville stopped short, and this time bit the tips of his riding glove. He was asking himself whether he might venture to speak more plainly. \"I only want to be of some use to you,\" he said, tentatively."], [234, "A BUBBLE FORTUNE. 224 \"I'm sure of that,\" answered Harry, heaving a sigh of ready relenting, \"it's very kind of you to have the patience to listen to me, and to take so much interest in my concerns.\" \"Idiot!\" again groaned Saville, between his teeth. \" You've no idea,\" went on the unconscious Harry7, \"what a comfort it is to me to have spoken to you, and that you do not think \u2014 though I cannot agree with all you say \u2014 that there is no chance of my retaining my place. I never thought I should have cared half so much; but it is not I alone who am involved in the question.\" \" Of course you care, \" broke in Saville, \" and of course it is not you alone who are concerned. For God's sake, Newton, think of your daughters, how their prospects will be ruined by the least weakness on your part. This man who has burst in upon your security and peace, and scattered them to the winds, while he professes to be active in the interests of justice and of kinsmanship, for anything I can tell, has not half the stake in the matter which you have. You tell me he is a middle-aged single man, with a profession in which he seems to have attained eminence, in which he has, doubtless, coined money.\" \" He spoke of Newton-Hayes as a bagatelle, \" said Harry almost piteously."], [235, "THE TEMPTER AND THE TEMPTED. 225 \"Just so, like the confounded cheek of these Colonial men \u2014 I make no question that he is Colonial in all his habits and associations. \" Then what the mischief is he doing here ? Why should he be permitted to rob you and your daughters of the property and station to which you were raised \u2014 in all good faith on your part and on that of the authorities who acknowledged your right? Your innocent, charming daughters will be thrown back on the world the next thing to penniless,\" protested the squire of Briarley, with a glitter, which looked almost like that of tears, in the smouldering fires of his eyes. \"It will be totally out of the power of the friends who have learnt to value them so highly, to do anything to help them and you \u2014 take that to heart, my dear fellow \u2014 for the very good reason that we shall all be in the same boat \u2014 as poverty stricken as the other unfortunates in this world.\" Air. Peregrine Saville accompanied Harry Newton as far as the avenue gates, plying him with insidious representations, hammering into him that, even if he were not going to be cheated, he and his daughters were about to be stripped and left destitute, in the most heartless manner, and repeating impressively that the papers re ferred to could not have lain unnoticed, in the old Australian trunk, all these years, even though, 15"], [236, "226 A BUBBLE FORTUNE. as Harry tried to put in his word, they had not been looked for in the meantime. But not a step farther than the avenue gates did Mr. Peregrine Saville go. He forgot all about being Captain Perry's special messenger, and he considered the time inopportune for the delivery of the message. Not, if he could prevent it, should another advance, though it were no wider than a hair's breadth, be made, which could farther compromise his son, until this disgusting difficulty of conflicting heirs for Newton-Hayes was settled. The squire of Briarley could have gnashed his teeth at the recollection of his own deed \u2014 in the public display, of his and Captain Perry's wishes and intentions made within the week."], [237, "227 CHAPTER XVI. A NIGHTMARE. IT was impossible, even if it had been advisable, to hide from Nanny7 \u2014 who had dimly divined something of the truth \u2014 and from Nell \u2014 who had not entertained the faintest suspicion of what might be the issue of Aliles Newton's visit to Newton-Hayes, \u2014 that their father's possession of the estate w7as hanging in the balance. In evitably both girls were deeply anxious with regard to the result of the investigation, but the anxiety took a different colour and shape accord ing to the different temperaments and aspirations of the persons concerned. Happily for Nell, she only partially compre hended what were likely to be the consequences \u2014 if her father were worsted \u2014 to the radiantly happy and tender dreams, in which she had been indulg ing lately. She did not scruple to speak of Captain Perry in connection with the strange"], [238, "228 A BUBBLE FORTUNE. news and the trying state of uncertainty in w7hich they were plunged. She wondered what he would say to it all, and whether he would think there could be any foundation for the claim, in which Air. Miles Newton appeared to believe implicitly. She had even a wistful doubt that the engrossing pre occupation of everybody interested in the sequel, might delay that declaration, which had long ago been quite sufficiently expressed in other ways than by direct speech, and that there might be farther delay in the marriage, which was to make two people who were one in heart and soul already, one also in name and life. But she failed to realize, as yet, that her father's loss of the position of squire of Newton-Hayes must mean her final separation from her lover. How could it, when they loved each other, and life and the world were before them? Nanny was devoutly thankful for Nell's tem porary unconsciousness. The mother's heart in the elder sister would fain spare suffering to the younger as long as it was possible. The terrible strain of the suspense was bad enough, without the knowledge, by anticipation, that Nell's hopes were blighted and her heart broken. If, indeed, that was all which was to come to the little family from their year's reign at Newton-Hayes, better they had remained in obscurity, making the"], [239, "A NIGHTMARE. 229 best of their narrow means in Paradise Row. Nanny and Nell were impelled to wander about, in the summer weather, anywhere and everywhere, in the gardens, in the shrubberies, in the park \u2014 anywhere within the bounds of the small domain of which they had thought so much when they came to it, twelve months before. If they had learnt to care less for it they were now making amends; a sub-consciousness of its peacefulness, beauty, and modest bountifulness was with them wherever they went, underlying and pervading every other sensation. The girls were restless and could not sit still with their usual occupations in the house. They shrank from going outside the gates, lest they should read, in the unguarded eyes of some neighbour suddenly encountered, a floating rumour, a dawning suspicion of the misfortune which was hanging over Harry Newton and his daughters. Their father, for the first time in their lives, persistently and obstinately avoided them. The two girls were thrown back on each other's society and sympathy, as they had been in every trouble of their youth. Nell, who, in spite of her superiority in size, was always the sooner tired in any exercise the sisters shared, invited Nanny to sit down on a seat, under a walnut tree, bursting into leaf, in the park. The"], [240, "A BUBBLE FORTUNE. 230 seat was placed so as to command a good view of the undulating country wmich lay beyond the park wall and stretched away into a misty blue distance. The couple sat in silence for a few minutes, during which Nell pulled one of the leaves of the tree, still in its vivid green, brushed with soft olive, crushed it between her taper fingers and smelt absently at its fragrance. \" Nanny, \" she said abruptly, \" don't you think it was treacherous and mean of Air. Aliles Newton to get admittance into the house, drink tea with you and me in the most friendly manner, while all the time he was proposing to oust father?\" Nanny could not restrain a laugh, though her heart was sore and heavy. \"Aly dear, it may be the man's own house he sought to enter, it may even be, in a sense, his tea which we took upon us graciously to dispense to him. Oh dear, what deluded, arrogant young geese of impostors he must have thought us ! \" \"He had no right to think such things,\" Nell defended herself and her sister with some spirit. \" And, what is more. I am certain he never thought them. He was quite pleasant and courteous, though a little unceremonious, you re member? I admit he was even interesting and entertaining, with his stories of another hemisphere and of his primitive travels, and he looked as if"], [241, "A NIGHTMARE. 231 he liked to interest and entertain us. What I complain of is, that he should have taken us in, meaning all the time to pay us back badly for doing our best for him.\" \" That is for giving him a cup of tea, for which he may be held to have paid, and for letting him into the house of which he may turn out to be the master? I do not see the great obliga tion. He could not well tell us on the spot the facts which he communicated to father. I am afraid we showed him pretty plainly that we re garded him as an impostor \u2014 at least I did \u2014 while, it may be, it was we who were the impostors all the time, although we did not know it. It is dreadful to think of it,\" ended Nanny, leaning back her head and recklessly crushing her hat against the tree-trunk in her affront and vexa tion. Nell was not prepared to take this view of the case, though it had been, often enough, pre sented to her lately. She said nothing, while she continued to crush and smell her walnut-tree leaf, now a mere pulp, staining the hollow of her hand. \" It is not, either, as if he were like any other man we knew \u2014 a man of his age, who has done and seen so much in the course of his life, who has been a leader, guide, and benefactor to his"], [242, "232 A BUBBLE FORTUNE. fellows, as it was evident he had been, though it came out casually and inadvertently.

You generally are.\""], [243, "A NIGHTMARE. 233 \" Nonsense,\" said Nell, with renewed briskness. \" Where should we be \u2014 all of us \u2014 without you ? And, I say, Nanny, father's cause is not lost yet. Air. Westmacott said, when he looked in last night, that it was for Air. Aliles Newton to estab lish his claim. If some papers of which father knows nothing, which he may or may not have, are not to be found, or if there has been any irregularity in the keeping of the register of a nameless London parish seventy years ago, the claim will fall to the ground, because Miles Newton's legal rights will not be proved.\" \" And think what that would be to him ! \" cried Nanny indignantly. \" He has entire faith in his case, and its collapse will mean loss of confidence in himself, in his father and mother, in everybody.

I tell you, Nell, this is a man of high aims and large ambitions, and you can consent, in your small interests, that he should fail ignominiously and be shamed in what has been, perhaps, his sole personal desire ! You call him an enemy, you ought not to do so. He did not come in an enemy's spirit. He came only to ask what he believed was his own, and he gave father and all of us the credit of sup posing that he had but to tell us what we were ignorant of, and to prove his words, to find us as willing to resign what was his, as he would have been if he had been in our place, and we in his. Remember \u2014 whatever may happen \u2014 there is no room to doubt, according to what has been telegraphed from Australia that he is father's cousin, and, after us two, his nearest blood rela tion. Having thus snubbed Nell severely, a treatment which the culprit bore with a mixture of bewil derment and meekness, Nanny's heart began to bleed anew for her unconscious sister. She did not attempt to take back her words, or to offer an affectionate apology for their vehemence. But, when the two returned to the house, to the room"], [245, "A NIGHTMARE. 235 which the pair shared as they had shared everything from infancy, which Nell, especially, had taken delight in embellishing, Nanny lingered behind her sister and locked herself in for a little space. It was only to sit like a statue\u2014 dry-eyed \u2014 and tell herself: \" Oh ! my poor, beautiful, sweet Nell, to think you may be called upon to pay the chief price! If it had not been for you and your Captain Perry, I think I should not have cared so much for father and myself; we have kept an innocent man long enough out of his due, for the dreadful thing to me is, that whatever it may be shown to be in point of law, I am convinced it is his by moral right. Nobody could look in his face and not see that, if he said a thing, he was convinced of the truth of what he said. It is such a brave, single-hearted, earnest face, to have toiled and striven all these forty years, and not grown weary in its single heartedness and earnestness, and we, who might have been proud to count ourselves his kin, are combining to defraud him.\" That night, as Nanny lay tossing by her sleeping sister, when a fresh day was about to break and the gray dawn to disperse the shadows of the night, there came to her one of those inexplicable quaking terrors, one of those subtly piercing intuitions of an importunate necessity to be up"], [246, "236 A BUBBLE FORTUNE. and doing, which occasionally assail the most reasonable people. No mortal can tell the origin and inspiration of the overwhelming impression \u2014 whether it is of the spirit world, only parted from us by a thin veil; whether it belongs to some occult mystery of irrepressible sympathy7 on the part of this fearful and wonderful human nature of ours, which no skilled medicine man, or learned philosopher, has ever thoroughly sifted and ex hausted. All that Nanny knew was that, though it was the middle of the night, she must instantly7 rise up and go to her father. He needed her, he was calling for her, though she heard no voice, she was so certain of it that she cried \u2014 half holding her breath not to waken Nell \u2014 as she sprang from her bed, \"Yes, father, I am coming.\" If she did not obey the call at once, she could not tell what awful calamity might not befall the family. She was trembling violently, because of the force of the emotion which had laid hold on her, but she was still sufficiently mistress of her self to put on her dressing-gown, strike a match and light a candle \u2014 shading it from her sister's closed eyes \u2014 before she softly opened the door, and stole along the couple of corridors, and down and up two short flights of stairs which separated the girls' room from their father's. She stopped"], [247, "A NIGHTMARE. 237 for a second before the closed door : what plausible excuse had she, for disturbing him at this hour of the night ? He had not looked himself for the last week, and her unexpected presence might not so much make him angry, as startle and agitate him, so as to do him bodily harm. A narrow bar of pale light beneath his door, decided her. She gently opened the bed-room door which was neither locked nor bolted, according to Harry's confiding custom \u2014 a custom which, even if he had been the master spirit in a plot to overthrow the British Constitution, it would not have occurred to him to forgo. The room was in partial darkness, only lighted sufficiently for her to see that her father was not in bed, and that the light came from the dress ing-room beyond \u2014 the door of which stood half open. Nanny put down the light she had held and advanced lightly with her slippered feet to the door of the dressing-room. Her father was with in, wearing the clothes he had worn the preced ing evening. He was stooping down before a large, battered, old travelling trunk, which Nanny knew as \"the Australian Trunk.\" It had been stowed away in the garret at Paradise Row. Here, it had been deposited in a large closet opening out of Harry's room, from some fancy"], [248, "238 A BUBBLE FORTUNE. of the master of the house to have a relic which had belonged to his father, to his boyhood and to the distant colony in which he had been reared, still near him, as Nanny had imagined. He must have dragged the old trunk from its rest ing place, unfastened it with the key in his pos session, and half emptied it of its contents, for the chairs, couch, and carpet around him were strewn and heaped with papers \u2014in piles and bundles, wrapped in yellowing newspapers, hastily torn open or tied together with tape which had been wrenched asunder. He was still adding to their number. He was pulling out more papers, leaning back to glance over them by the light of the candle on the table behind him, and then flinging them recklessly on the heaps accumulating on every side of him. Nanny could hear his panting breath, the re sult of his unusual exertions, or was it the ef fect of the irresistible curiosity and gnawing sus pense which had goaded him on to learn his fate, against all rule and in defiance of discretion ? Was it a half formed dastardly7 criminal purpose, against which the man's better nature strove in fierce revolt? In truth, it was largely owing to the mute company in whose presence Harry was pursuing his dan gerous operations, and to his consciousness of their"], [249, "A NIGHTMARE. 239 close attendance on every dubious nefarious act. He knew that he was not alone in his own dress-\u00bb ing-room in the middle of the night, though he was perfectly unconscious of the only living creature \u2014 his daughter Nanny \u2014 standing in the shadow of the half open door, watching him. Like a famous historical personage \u2014 Richard the Crookback \u2014 on the eve of the battle of Bos worth, poor Harry had been constrained to enter tain uninvited guests, to look into reproachful eyes \u2014 long closed \u2014 and listen to accusing voices \u2014 long silent \u2014 while he went about his self imposed task. The old man \u2014 his father \u2014 who had been so honest and sturdy, and so proud and hopeful for his son, had stood by Harry's side while he turned over memoranda and accounts con nected with the Red Rock Falls estate, charts and specifications belonging to the disastrous mining speculation, even some of Harry's early Oxford bills. But old John Newton was by no means the only witness to the ceremony."], [250, "240 CHAPTER XVII. \"IS IT WORTH IT, FATHER?\" WHAT a spectral company it was ! There was the cousin Aliles with whom Harry had been well acquainted when a boy, the long-legged, small-bodied man, melancholy yet humorous, like Jaques of Arden, always dis satisfied, yet not without a cynical perception of his dissatisfaction. Harry began to see, beyond the possibility of error on his part, a kind of sha dowy resemblance between the two cousin Aliles \u2014 the elder who could jest at his own discomfi ture, and the younger who had not been discom fited, who had done what he wished and had been content; while he could not withhold a laugh under the provocation of his mother's having for gotten the very name of the London church in which she was married. There were the little lads \u2014 the small barbari ans of the bush \u2014 to whom the big boy \u2014 Harry"], [251, "\" IS IT WORTH IT, FATHER ? \" 241 Newton\u2014 had been an unapproachable hero, an all-victorious young king, of whom he had been fond in his turn, the news of whose untimely death had been the first shock and sharp pang to Harry's vigorous youth. He would have be lieved, only a week ago, that he had forgotten their 'every lineament, yet there they were before him, flaxen-haired and sunburnt, as vividly real as in life. There was their mother too \u2014 why, she haunted and harassed him more than any of the other ghosts who were hovering about him, and inter fering with what he wTas doing! He supposed it was because he had heard Saville disparage her without knocking him down, and he himself was tempted to deal her fair name a cruel, cowardly blow, which might cause her very son to doubt and distrust her. Harry saw her again, as plainly as if they had parted yesterday \u2014 a tall, faded, care-worn woman, the only white woman at Red Rock Falls, or for miles around. She was prac tically left to herself for the greater part of the day; she had learnt to be silent, as a matter of necessity; she had kept her troubles to herself as she looked after the household, and had grown taciturn and reserved. But her words, though few, had always been friendly to her sons' play mate and guardian. Alany a little dainty she 16"], [252, "A BUBBLE FORTUNE. 242 had cooked and stored up for him when, by his own carelessness, he was absent from the family meals. She had taken care of the clothes which he was apt to treat cavalierly enough, with the greatest attention to his comfort and to his creditable appearance as the son of the principal owner of Red Rock Falls. During a solitary experience of illness she had nursed him, with a mother's ungrudging devotion. Her ey7es had alway7s been grave and anxious, but they had never held a spark of hostility to him till to-night. He was searching excitedly for what he could not find. He began to have a wild hope that he had been right when he had said, without much warrant, in the presence of Air. Westmacott and Aliles Newton the younger, that he \u2014 Harry \u2014 did not believe he had any of the elder Aliles' papers in his possession. At that moment his hand fell on a small unshapely parcel, tied with string. He tugged at the string till the knot gave way. Within an outer covering were several tightly-rolled-up papers of different sizes, on paper of different colours and textures. Harry read what was written on the covering, with strained methodicalness, as if he were engaged on a perfectly lawful and proper business. The round handwriting ran thus : \"Aly7 Papers, committed to the care of my Uncle John"], [253, "\"IS IT WORTH IT, FATHER?\" 243 Newton, of Red Rock Falls, as my wife Sarah and I have made up our minds to try7 and start on our own account and that of the children; and it may not be safe\u2014 while there is no need \u2014 to carry the papers with us, not knowing what may befall us travelling through a district where the bush-rangers have not all been put down, and where the blacks have been troublesome of late. God grant we reach our destination in safety7. Signed: Aliles Newton.\" with the date Harry well remembered. The first of the enclosed papers was the said Aliles Newton's will, of no use to any human being. The next was a paper, signed respectively by7 John and Aliles Newton, in which Aliles, in con sideration of a certain sum of money, paid down to him, relinquished the small interest he had held in the Red Rock Falls property7. Useless also. Ah ! here were copies of the certificates of the baptism of the elder Aliles Newton and of his father's marriage at Twineham Church, in Hunt ingdonshire. These were the certificates of which the brick red man \u2014their descendant, who had made all the stir\u2014 had said it would be a simple enough matter to procure duplicates. Harry's hand shook like a leaf in an autumn gale, when he took up the remaining paper. Yes,"], [254, "A BUBBLE FORTUNE. 244 it was a copy of the very certificate which the claimant had admitted it might be hard to recover ; the certificate of the marriage of Aliles Newton of Twineham Farm, Huntingdonshire, and of Sarah Cree of the same place, both resident, for the time being, in the parish of St. Alary -le-Strand, London, at the church of the said parish, duly attested by7 qualified witnesses. The slip of paper fluttered in Harry's hand, vibrating with each hard-drawn breath and with the draught from the open doors. He thrust it dangerously near the streaming flame from the candle, as if to decipher the contents better. The next moment he sprang to his feet, with a face like ashes. \"Oh! is it worth it. father?\" asked a voice, in which sounded at once a solemn challenge and an imploring appeal, and, turning towards it, his daughter Nanny stood revealed in the doorway, between the two rooms. \"What are you doing here, Nanny?\" stuttered Harry, in a loud, blustering tone which was quite unnatural to him. \" How dare you come into my7 room at such a time when I am particularly engaged, as you see, and have not sent for you? \" \" But you wanted me, \" said Nanny, still with unconscious solemnity. \" I knew it even though I was lying in bed, thinking only how I might"], [255, "\"IS IT WORTH IT, FATHER?\" 245 go to sleep, then, of course, there was nothing I would not have done to come to you.\" Harry had calmed down and recovered his outward composure, though any7one, watching him narrowly, might have seen that he had still a difficulty in overcoming a slight trembling of his hands and chattering of his teeth. \" Well, my dear, I am much obliged to you for your solicitude, but it is foolish of you, and not what I should have expected from your sense, to leave your bed and go wandering over the house because of some silly dream. You see, there is nothing wrong with me and I'm sorry if I've been cross with you. Don't you think the best thing will be for you to go back to j7our room at once, lest you catch cold, or Nell should awake and come after you, and I should have both of you on my hands in the small hours ? Off with you, Nanny, and leave me to \u2014 to the tidying up of that old lumber, before it is taken down to the library7 to be poked into by those precious bull-dogs, or blood-hounds\u2014 I don't know which to call them,\" broke off Harry, with forced pleasantry. \" Let me help y7ou, father,\" urged Nanny, catching up his tone instantly. \" You were not brought up a business man, like Air. Westmacott or Air. Miles Newton, you are not good at"], [256, "246 A BUBBLE FORTUNE. setting your house in order. \" She strove to speak quietly and cheerfully. \" Let me gather up these loose papers, w7hich you've let fall out of that envelope, and tie them up again securely. They will get mixed up with the others if you do not take care, and \u2014 and are they7 not the very papers which aro wanted \u2014 Air. Aliles Newton's papers? \" She looked him steadily in the face, with piteous, but unflinching eyes, as she would have sought to control a madman, for surely her father was on the verge of madness that night. The father and the daughter gazed at each other in silence for a second, then she said: \"It you like, I'll put them back, lock them up and take the key7, so that y7ou may not be farther troubled with them. I'll see that they are forth coming in the morning, we need not mind about the rest, we can finish tidying them up to-morrow. \" She tried to speak as if the suggestion were of no moment, but, in spite of herself, her voice shook and faltered so that it was painful to hear it. He heard it, looked again into her honest steadfast eyes, and turned away, unable to bear their light. \" Have it your own way, child, \" he said, half testily, half wearily. Then he broke down utterly, threw aside the paper which would cost him Newton-Hayes and flung himself heavily on the"], [257, "\"IS IT WORTH IT, FATHER?\" 247 couch near him, pushing aside the other papers heaped on it, with a kind of irrational anger, as if they were so many living foes contemplating his defeat and rejoicing over it. Lie covered his face with his hands and groaned aloud. \" It is cruelly hard upon me, Nanny, I neither knew nor cared about the succession to this place, I certainly never sought after it, but to give it up after I've held it for a year \u2014 only a year; and to be reduced to the old insignificance, the old straitened circumstances \u2014 I daresay ten times worse than before; to have twice had to endure such a reverse, in the course of my life, is enough to make a rogue of the most upright of men.\" She took no notice of his admission, she cast her eyes down with a shame-faced expression, to avoid meeting his eye as he made it, but she flung her soft white arms, from which the wide sleeves of her dressing-gown fell back, round his neck, holding him in a passionate embrace, and reminding him with the most loving per suasion, \" We were happy, dear, in Paradise Row, and none was happier than you, can we not be happy, in the same way, again?\" Harry shook his bowed-down head. \" It was different. It was a case where ignorance was bliss,\" he explained, looking up with a rueful smile. \" It is easy enough not to miss"], [258, "248 A BUBBLE FORTUNE. what we never had, or had in other circumstances ; it is difficult to give it all up and return to what can no longer content us. But it is not for my7self that my heart is sore, it is for you two poor girls \u2014 all the bright and happy hopes, with which you came here, overthrown and crushed out of existence. You, so well calculated to adorn the station into which you were lifted, dashed down again, from no fault of yours!\" \"Never mind us, father,\" protested Nanny, with brave cheerfulness, \" we shall do very well, as we did before. I don't know that we \u2014 that I, at least \u2014 have taken any7 great root in the new soil. I have sometimes been tempted to think it a poor enough soil for intelligent minds and im mortal souls, after all. But I must take care not to whisper that now, lest people say the grapes are sour. Nell and I will be willing, glad to do anything to work, to beg even, rather than that you should \u2014 \" \" Than that I should steal, \" blurted out Harry bitterly, while again Nanny7 hung her head. \"That paper was not mine and I w-as in a fair way to destroy it, when y7ou interrupted me,\" he said recklessly7, \"I almost wish you had not come when you were not wanted.\" His eyes began to blaze again \u2014 those mild bovine eyes which had so rarely kindled with anger. \" What made"], [259, "\"IS IT WORTH IT, FATHER?\" 249 the fellow come here? He has neither son, nor daughter, nor wife? He is alone in the world. He has his profession and all he cares for out there \u2014 very likely he is richer than we were when Newton-Hayes was ours. Why could he not let us alone? \" Then Nanny raised herself in her youthful righteousness. \"He came for his own,\" she said emphatically. \"He had faith in us, that the moment we saw it was his by right we would be willing to give up what was not ours. How could we desire to keep it from him when he had the prior claim, or to fail him when he trusted us ? \" \" And your fine prospects, yours and Nell's ? My pretty Nell ! \u2014 her marriage will be all in the air now,\" continued Harry, with almost childish persistency. \" I can tell you, Nanny, Saville will have nothing to say to her \u2014 he as good as told me so \u2014 however fair and sweet she may be, if she is penniless, and it will break the heart of my little girl \u2014 Lucy's daughter \u2014 her mother's image.\" Nanny did not stop to ask which of the Savilles he meant, the elder or the younger. \"Well, let it be so, let him go,\" she said with passionate scorn. \" He is not worth lamenta tion and wrong-doing, any more than the rest that we have lost is worth it.\""], [260, "250 A BUBBLE FORTUNE. \" Easy to say7, Nanny7, easy7 to say, \" repeated Harry gloomily, but he was in his right mind once more. He picked up the paper he had flung down, smoothed it out deliberately, and handed it to her. \" There, keep the thing till daylight. I cannot go to the Devil in broad daylight with the sun shining in upon me. The miserable scrap\u2014 on which the dead set such store that they dared not risk it, when they were risking their lives \u2014 can be put back in its place then. Go away back to bed, child, or you'll get your death and that will not help us.\" He looked round and shivered, although it was a summer night. \" I'll leave this mess as it is, and turn in myself. \" She took the paper, looked anew into his haggard face, flung her arms round him once more, kissed him affectionately and turned to go. He called her back. \" You'll not tell her \u2014 Nell,\" he begged, with wistful furtive glance and whitening lips, his voice sinking into a whisper. \"No, never,\" she assured him with all her heart and soul. \" You may depend upon me. What did you think me? Can you and I not have a secret and keep it ?\" She was fain to speak as if she made light of the secret, which was crimsoning her cheeks with shame for him, and weighing like a load of guilt"], [261, "\"IS IT WORTH IT, FATHER?\" 251 which she herself had incurred, on her heart, even while she strove to convince him that, however he might have humiliated himself in her eyes, the humiliation should not be breathed to sully7 the ears, and wound to the quick, his best- beloved daughter."], [262, "CHAPTER XVIII. SURRENDER. \" rT\"'HERE, gentlemen, is the paper you want. J^ I have to congratulate you, Cousin Aliles,\" said Harry Newton, when the business appoint ment was kept in the library at Newton-Hayes. He made no secret of what he had been about, as he tossed the missing paper, which was most in request, across the table. He was no longer pale but flushed, and wearing well-nigh an air of elation. The lumbering old trunk before him was standing unlocked and thrown open, and its heterogeneous papers had evidently been rum maged through and turned over, which no doubt accounted for the fact that Harry could at once put his hand on the copy of the certificate in question. Mr. Westmacott rapped the table with his ivory-white knuckles, in his exasperation, and stared at the speaker reproachfully. \" Out of order,"], [263, "SURRENDER. 253 disgracefully out of order,\" his gesture and look said. Aliles Newton examined the paper with eager satisfaction. \"Ah! you have found it,\" he cried heartily. \" I thought so. But, if it had been lost, I should never have rested, till I had had every parish register in London hunted up and examined, though the business had taken months to accom plish. There was not only the place at stake, there was the confirmation of my poor mother's words.\" He stopped, as if he recalled another consideration, and looked fixedly, in a puzzled way, at his cousin. But nothing could be said to a man who had straightway produced the missing link in the chain of proof against himself. Instead of putting the smallest obstruction in the path of justice, he was doing his utmost, however irregularly, to aid his adversary. Harry was now quite composed, though it was clear that his cheerfulness was forced, yet he looked and spoke with as much spirit as that displayed by the brick-red man before him, who in place of his usual interested, alert look, ap peared, for some reason, perplexed and distrait. \" Then am I to understand, Air. Newton, that you do not mean to oppose your relative's claim?\" inquired Air. Westmacott, stiffly and gravely."], [264, "A BUBBLE FORTUNE. 254 Harry nodded, and, to make assurance doubly sure, said plainly, \"That is my meaning.\" \" Don't y7ou think, sir, your determination is rather hasty?\" objected the lawyer, knitting his brows and feeling considerably put out, on his own account. He found himself in trying and extraordinary circumstances. On the one hand, he was burdened with a client who had always been unsophisticated, to the verge of folly. On the other, he was entangled with an adversary. who, shrewd as he seemed in some respects, had distinctly7 declined to appoint a lawyer to see him through a troublesome affair. \" What does it signify7 whether my determina tion is hasty- or otherwise, if it is founded on right reason?\" answered Harry, in a more nettled tone than was called for, but anv amount of irritability might well be overlooked in a man in Harry's situation. \" I cannot say that I should advise legal mea sures to protect y7our rights,\" resumed Air. West macott, who was not altogether shaken out of his wonted precision and deliberation. \" I must admit that the evidence strikes me as too incontest able for that course, but I should certainlv like. for my own comfort and credit, to have further opinion of counsel.\" \" Do you suggest that my cousin and I should"], [265, "SURRENDER. 255 go to law for y7our satisfaction? \" demanded Harry, taking up the cudgels against his friend and quondam agent, with a gruffness and rude ness grafted on his recent jaunty bluster, both moods being wholly foreign to the natural man. \"I confess, I do not see why we should pile up and protract the agony,\" argued the man from the bush, \" if we are mutually satisfied \u2014 that is, \" he corrected himself quickly, \" convinced of the direction in which justice lies. I presume a formal application to the proper court will settle the matter and effect the transfer. To heap up costs, which will fall on the loser, may be the technical line to pursue, but, pardon me, AIr. Westmacott, it does not recommend itself to my common sense, as wise in any light.\" \"So far from proposing to make any fight for what I recognize is not mine,\" said Harry, in the jerky defiant manner in which he had previously7 spoken, thrusting his hands into his pockets, and leaning back in the chair, \" I am going to vacate the place to my successor at once \u2014 that is, with in the next few days. I shall discharge the servants, unless he chooses to take them on, to morrow, and carry off my family belongings \u2014 such as they are \u2014 in fact, cut my7 stick without loss of time. I have nothing more to do here"], [266, "256 A BUBBLE FORTUNE. and I want to be off without incurring more ex pense \u2014 I am sick of the whole business.\" \" There is not the slightest obligation on you to leave in this hurried way7,\" remonstrated Aliles Newton, taken aback by Harry's brusqueness and approach to levity. \" There is a great deal to settle yet.\" \" There are questions of compensation and com promise,\" represented Air. Westmacott hastily. \" Why ! so strange a proceeding will look like flight, like irreconcilable hostility between two relatives; such ill-advised rashness may even, if you will forgive me, sir, for reminding you of the possible consequences, bring undeserved as persions upon your character.\" Air. Westmacott's outraged official dignity, as well as his shrewd ness and fidelity, compelled him to make the last suggestion. But all the excellent plans brought forward, with genuine anxiety7, to serve the culprit who was proposing to act more like a child in a pet than like a reasonable being, were utterly- disregarded, and set at naught, by7 Harry. There was, in his conduct at this crisis, an element of fey 11 ess, and, as everybody knows, a fey man acts in direct contrast to his natural character and is not altogether responsible for his actions. He re peated that he was sick of the short-lived struggle."], [267, "SURRENDER. 257 He insisted that what had to be done were better done without delay. He scouted the notion of compensation and compromise, in the airiest and most extravagant fashion. He thought if he gave up everything on the spot, he might be held free from the necessity of repaying such of the year's rental as had passed into his hands. In point of fact, the larger part of it had been spent, by anticipation, under Air. Westmacott's advice, on the improvement of the property and on the few alterations in the house. As for the money which the lawyer and Lady Gosforth had advanced, for Harry to start with, until he should come into the income from the estate, he would pay it back if he lived; and if he paid by small instalments he daresayed they would bear with him and not be hard creditors. What was there to settle, unless damages? and whatever these were could be done as well, nay, better, after he had left Newton-Hayes. \"Flight?\" Yes, it was flight from an untenable and intolerable position, and when the retreat was accomplished, all the world willing to see, would admit it was the only course for an honest man, with the spirit of a fly, to pursue. Would they have him go on masquerading under false colours, a moment longer than he could help? Did they wish him to sink, overwhelmed, by a calamity which was no '7"], [268, "258 A BUBBLE FORTUNE. fault of his? Ought he not rather to take im mediate steps to recover himself, so as to be fit for the performance of such duties in life as re mained to him? He would take his character into his own keeping, he might be safely trusted to look after it. He thought neither friend nor foe of his could deny his right to act, according to the best of his judgment, in what he begged to tell them was his own concern. \" And where are we going, father ? \" inquired Nanny, when Harry Newton was alone with his daughters and had told them what had come to pass, while Nell's consternation was too over powering to leave her voice to speak. \" Why! back to Foxchester, of course,\" said Harry, opening his eyes wide, as if there could not be two opinions. \"Where else should we go, when your mother is there? That is, she is lying in St. Nicholas' churchyard there,\" he explained, with a momentary stammer and some confusion ; \" and when my time comes I expect to be laid beside her.\" \" But that will not be for many a day, please God, for our sakes,\" said Nanny gently7. \" No, I hope not, my dears,\" acquiesced Harry at once, with a restless sigh. \" Another reason for my going to Foxchester is, that I think, if I were there, I should get office work again with-"], [269, "SURRENDER. 259 out much difficulty. I may even find my old berth waiting for me. Do you know when Coxe was here, he said he did not think he should retain Lane for more than the year? You remember Lane, who was under me, and got the step when I left? Well, the arrangement has not turned out satisfactorily. Lane was always a flighty beggar, and now he is thinking of trying to get some agency in Birmingham \u2014 or Bristol, was it? \u2014 where his friends are. Anyhow the chance is worth looking after \u2014 don't you think so, girls?\" It was like Harry to double back on the old refuge; at the same time Nanny, who was the only girl capable of reflecting, and who had been doing nothing save think of the family's future for the last twelve hours, could not, whatever her inclinations said to the contrary, contradict him. Her father was no longer young. He had never had the regular training, nor the energy7 which might have supplied the lack of training, that would have fitted him to compete success fully with the smart pushing clerks, drawn from another class, and developed by a different method, who, in age, might have been his sons. Fox chester, where he had been known and liked, might hold the best opening for him. Nanny, too might get an engagement, and take her place in the High School at Foxchester, as she had origin-"], [270, "260 A BUBBLE FORTUNE. ally proposed, when the Newtons quitted Newton- Hayes. The question was not \u2014 Nanny told herself severely \u2014 how much or how little mortification they might be spared, nor even what temptations they might escape, as how best and soonest they might earn their daily bread. Apart from the reasonable recommendations of the place which she dared not refuse to consider, Nanny had a feeling that, to her father, going back to Foxchester was, in many respects, like going home to her mother. He was in haste to do it. He could not be quiet till he did it. Standing by her grave would be like telling her everything, confiding to her how sorely he had been tried, and how near he had been to doing something which would have shocked her inex pressibly, so that it would have parted them even if she had been still alive. But it was all over \u2014 the precipice on whose brink he had stood, the gulf which had yawned at his feet \u2014 he had paid the forfeit, and he would be able to say, gladly, that he had not done it; he had been saved, thank God ! from the guilt and the infamy. Perhaps, she would tell him it was she who had sent their girl, his and hers, their little Nanny, to interpose in time? Anyhow she would know he was sorry that the base thought had ever entered his head, and all would be well again."], [271, "SURRENDER. 261 In the face of these surmises, which were next door to convictions, it seemed of small account to Nanny that she and Nell should have to endure the pain of returning to the old quarters, which they had left in very different circumstances. She might feel their part in the performance later, but at present she could not afford the leisure to brood and fret over it. As for Nell, she was stunned by the blow, and past active exertion of any kind, so that every thing fell on Nanny, who was aware, in the bustle and worry of sudden departure, that she must be furnished with memory, foresight and resource for three persons instead of one. It was well for the little woman that she was as bright as polished steel, with the fine temper and elasticity of the best steel, on an emergency. Poor Nell had realized, at last, what the loss of Newton-Hayes meant to her. There were various signs calculated to enlighten even the most single-hearted. Mr. Peregrine Saville had disappeared from the scene, during these last momentous days. No message or letter had come from Captain Perry, to whom, surely, his father must have communicated a piece of news which interested him so nearly, which even now was about to burst on the neighbourhood. Worldly precepts and maxims, appropriate to the situation,"], [272, "262 A BUBBLE FORTUNE. which Nell had heard, more than once, confidently enumerated during the last twelve months, without paying much heed to the speakers, suddenly recurred to her mind with irresistible force Captain Perry could no longer think of marry ing her, innocent as she was of any offence against their love, however much he might regret the grim necessity of giving her up. In his set there could not be two opinions on the subject. The pair were both young, with bodies and minds in their prime. The world and life, with all their endless possibilities, lay before the two ; nevertheless marriage was impossible, according to the verdict of the county. He would be mad to take such an unheard-of, destructive step, she would be mad to consent to it for his sake, still more than for her own. Even an indefinite engagement was very much to be deprecated. Nell, brought up with a totally different standard, could not see or comprehend the impossibility7, but her meekness and submission \u2014 above all, her dread of injuring the man she loved as her own soul \u2014 would cause her to take the verdict on trust, and bow to it. She was cut to the tender heart, the bright world was darkened to her, but she struggled desper ately to conform herself to what must be. Not even to Nanny would Nell complain or imply that Captain Perry had failed her, and that"], [273, "SURRENDER. 263 she was being shamefully used. Nell was simple and gentle, but she was neither weak nor disloyal. If she could have hidden her white cheeks and the heavy eyes, with the dark rings underneath them, she would have done it. As it was, she held up her drooping head every time anybody-, especially every time her father and sister, looked at her. She was bent on giving no trouble and on aiding Nanny to the utmost of Nell's power, till her strength all at once collapsed and she had to creep up to her room, too thankful to escape observation, and stay there till she found fresh capacity for endurance, to pray for help where help was never denied, to lie down on her bed and turn her face to the wall, like a stricken animal who hides from its kind and will not make so much as a moan. Nothing on earth would have made Nanny do it \u2014 so long as there was fighting against odds and work to be done, she would have kept on, till she died, fighting and working. Women \u2014 good women, even ofthe same household \u2014 are very differently constituted."], [274, "264 CHAPTER XIX. GOING BACK TO FOXCHESTER. IT was better that the family should go at once, Nanny agreed with her father, and that there should be no time left for leave-takings either of place or people. Lady Gosforth had started, immediately after the garden-party at Briarley, on a visit of congratulation to her for tunate nephew who was in Paris. The Went worths and the most friendly of the acquaintances, Avhom the Newtons had made since they7 came to Newton-Hay7es, had not recovered sufficiently from the shock of the discovery, that the neigh bourhood had \" left cards \" on the wrong people, since Harry Newton was declared not to be the rightful owner of the late Air. Jasper Newton's house and lands. Besides, to do the county justice, hardly- anybody7 had the least notion that the father and daughters were to leave so soon. \" Bless my soul ! \" exclaimed the red-faced"], [275, "GOING BACK TO FOXCHESTER. 265 squire when the date of their departure came to his ears, \"it looks like bolting, and, though I always thought the old man a muff, I understand it was his misfortune, not his fault. Why don't Westmacott put a stop to it? The new fellow must be a sorry sort to drive out his own, with a run, in this fashion.\" Nanny guessed what they had escaped when the vicar took the victims by surprise, wrung the hand of each in turn and talked in a lowered voice of the mysterious ways of Providence. Nobody doubted the good man's sincerity and nobody disagreed with him, and yet it was pain ful to discuss these mysterious ways with an excellent soul whose course, however hampered and burdened, was at least plain-sailing, with bread provided and water made sure, for him and his, with the blessing of Heaven on his mild drudgery and worst difficulties. Nevertheless, Nanny had to undergo a more trying encounter with an intruder on her crowd of engagements. She was told, in the middle of her packing, that a gentleman wished particularly7 to see her. She guessed, in a moment, from the constrained tone and conscious look of the ser vant who had delivered the message, that the gentleman w-as the man who was the centre of curiosity, to great and small in these days. She"], [276, "266 A BUBBLE FORTUNE. had not bidden the servants say beforehand that she was engaged, and she could see no alternative to running down, in one of the calico wrappers, which she had been accustomed to wear in the mornings at Foxchester. She had deliberately resumed it for the work she had in hand, in which she would not have a maid to help her. What was she going to do with a maid? Her day, and Nell's, for such services from maids was over. She would grant the interview which was sought for, in the guise which was not unbefit ting her present fortunes, and she w7ould not think twice over it. She had been called upon to do harder things lately7, than to receive and dismiss even this particular visitor. There, in the middle of the drawing-room, stood the brick-red man, the Colonist, whom she and Nell had entertained only a few nights ago. Nanny7 and Aliles Newton had not met in the interval, for there had literally been no time for the attempting of further advances by the winner, or for their rejection by the losers. It was for him to entertain them now if he would, since the room was no longer theirs but his, while it was unchanged in its pleasant picturesqueness, which had grown so homelike. Not an article was displaced, except some of the girls' private property, which Nanny herself did not miss in"], [277, "GOING BACK TO F'OXCHESTER. 267 the excitement of the moment. It would have required a practised eye to detect that the arrange ment of the plumes of lilac and trails of labur num, the branches of may and honeysuckle, the first roses, the green-house ferns, arum lilies, tube roses and azaleas which had been sent in, accord ing to rule, by the gardener, had not been Nell's cherished work as on former occasions, but had been undertaken, with considerable searchings of heart, by no less a person than Braintree, with the assistance of a parlour-maid. Aliles Newton looked straight in the eyes of Harry Newton's daughter, as he had looked the only time he had seen her before. If there came into his eyes an expression of unbounded respect and lively admiration for the simple little figure, freed from all encumbrances of falling lace or entangling embroidery, stripped of every ad junct of ring and bracelet, with the beautiful clear-cut face having the hair drawn back and twisted round in the quickest, easiest fashion, he was so bent on his errand that he was not conscious of what his eyes expressed, so that he might have banished the look from them as supereroga tory to the business on which he had come, and possibly a liberty under the circumstances. \" I have had to ask to see you, Miss Newton,\" he explained, after the first formal, slightly awkward"], [278, "268 A BUBBLE FORTUNE. greeting. \" Your father regrets he is engaged every time I call, and if I catch such a glimpse of him outside, as I have watched and waited for, he walks away from me so determinedly that, upon my word, I do not feel warranted in following him.\" Nanny could not refrain a faint smile at the picture, but she waited to hear something further before she spoke. \"He does the same to Westmacott, who has been here several times \u2014 both on his own account and on mine. He \u2014 your father \u2014 says he has had his say, and does not wish any further discussion of the subject, whatever remains to be settled can be done better by writing. It is ridiculous and absurd of him,\" represented Aliles Newton, vehemently7 for a man of his years, accustomed to command himself, \" to go away-, carrying y7ou and your sister with him, in this red-hot haste. Of course, I never, for a single instant, contem plated any move of this kind. Where is the good of our being cousins and having come to an amicable understanding, if he is to go on in this outrageous manner? Further arrangements ought to have been made, before any step of the kind was taken by him.\" \" It is for my father to decide \u2014 y7ou will allow that, Air. Newton,\" she said quietly, \"and it is"], [279, "GOING BACK TO FOXCHESTER. 269 not for me to interfere \u2014 you must know that also.\" \"I admit nothing,\" he cried, in his tumult of feeling, \" I knew far less than I ought to have known, though, no doubt, that was my own fault, for which I shall never cease to reproach myself. I took things for granted which I ought to have inquired into. Miss Newton, you will believe me that I had no conception of what had been the state of your father's affairs, before he suc ceeded to this unlucky bone of contention, when I came to England. We, at Brisbane \u2014 my mother, my stepfather and I \u2014 had heard that old John Newton of Red Rock Falls had got on in the world, till he was, as we imagined, rolling in riches. We were aware that he had met with reverses later in his life, but we had no suspicion that the crash was so complete, that no fragment of his great fortune remained for his son. Apart from that mistake, so long an interval had elapsed that Harry Newton might have acquired half a dozen competences to fall back upon. \" Nanny could have smiled again. There spoke the successful man of the great Colony, who could, without question, have exercised his vigorous alert faculties, turned the clever hand of a born mechanic, as well as of a pioneer and traveller, to"], [280, "A BUBBLE FORTUNE. 270 whatever it found to do, and heaped up, with comparatively little effort, affluence and wealth without stint, if he had not chosen, by preference, to be the first to lay down tracks in the wil derness, and to carry, to her utmost bounds, the iron rails of the Australian world. Nanny was chiefly anxious to correct an error, into which her companion might have fallen. \"Aly7 father was not a money-making man,\" she explained ort her part, \"but he maintained his family in independence and comfort, and will maintain them again \u2014 that is, if we will let him,\" she finished, with an unconscious shade of hauteur and an intrepidity which were not lost on the listener. \" From the moment that Westmacott enlight ened me,\" Aliles Newton struggled to tell his tale and get his way, \" I was prepared, and would have been only too glad to do what I was bound, in common justice, to do, to make Harry- Newton an allowance. I am going back, pre sently, to Australia, to wind up my business over there. I may be absent for years, I may- never return to England, I cannot say. I have not any great inclination to come back, after the mischief I have contrived to do in a remarkably short time, when all the while I meant to be reasonable and friendly, \" he said ruefully. \" What,"], [281, "GOING BACK TO FOXCHESTER. 271 in the name of common sense and sober reason, was there to keep you \u2014 your father, I mean \u2014 from coming to terms with me, and consenting to stay on, in my absence, at Newton-Hayes \u2014 which has been your home for a year \u2014 keeping up the place, instead of leaving the old house to get desolate?\" \"There was everything to prevent it,\" said Nanny, with decision. \" Everything which means, to us, independence and self-respect ; we. could not consent to be what would be, in effect, your pensioners, after my father had been master here. Perhaps you are judging by a different standard, perhaps it is different in Australia, where, I believe, there is still a primitive con dition of things in many places. No, I cannot help you, sir.\" She shook her head and smiled again slightly. \"You cannot both keep your cake and eat it. You have established your claim to Newton-Hayes. It is a perfectly just and good claim, so that my father has not disputed it; you must be content w-ith that and with our not contesting it. You must not mind turning us out. It may hurt you a little, though, I assure you, it need not, but, you see, you cannot have everything.\" There might be a spice of malice in her words, for men and women\u2014 especially high-"], [282, "A BUBBLE FORTUNE. 272 spirited men and women \u2014 are apt to wreck their barks on the rock of what is called \" proper pride,\" still, she intended to take leave of him in the most charitable spirit. She was holding out her hand, to bid him good-bye, in a far more friendly fashion than that in which she had made his acquaintance, when she caught a fuller view of his vexed, mortified face, and repented even of the spice of malice in which she had indulged. \"Indeed it is for the best,\" she said, earnestly and gently, \" as I am quite sure you have meant and done everything for the best all along. I shall tell my father what you have said when he can hear and appreciate it, when this terrible ordeal \u2014 I don't deny it is terrible \u2014 is past. He is the last man to bear a grudge; and I should like to say from myself, that we cannot take an allowance from you, or anybody7, because we can work for our living. It is not because we despise it, as coming from you \u2014 our cousin \u2014 but because, really and truly, we do not require it, and are better without it. You must forgive our pride \u2014 if it is pride \u2014 and not think us ungrateful.

She could continue to think of him as she had first thought, as a man open like the day, a diligent, unselfish man by7 nature and grace, a helper of his fellows. There was another trifling interruption, worry ing when it occurred, but which could afterwards be recalled with pleasure. When the Newtons had started on their journey, and had gone as far as the larger station at Atherney, they found the lower portion occupied by a group of the county gentlemen around, who had been attending quarter sessions. The gentlemen had been, as a matter of course, discussing the strange and lamentable story of the mistake in the suc cession to Newton-Hayes. They had been com menting freely, in addition, on the manner in which the ex-squire appeared to them to have at once renounced the contest. With the inconsis tency of human nature, Harry's former critics took to applauding the action. \" The poor fellow has given no trouble he could help, behaved like a gentleman after all, though he was a duffer with regard to riding to hounds and sport in general. \" The speaker proceeded to say, hotly, that he 18"], [284, "A BUBBLE FORTUNE. 274 did not think they \u2014 the county \u2014 would find them selves better off in Mr. Harry Newton's succes sor, \" The lawful heir, or whatever the legal phrase was, Mr. Aliles Newton.\" \" Oh! come now, Squire,\" remonstrated a younger, more liberal man, \" I've nothing to say against the old fellow, I always rather liked him and thought you were inclined to be hard upon him. But the new man is something very different, a long way beyond him. He is reported to be a distinguished engineer, one of the most adven turous and indefatigable travellers who has opened up the length and breadth of his huge island. His name will not be forgotten in its history7, as a developer of its resources. It will be a feather in our cap to have him one of us. We made much of the Judge \" \u2014 referring to a local notability \u2014 \" when he bought his country-house down here, but his fame has not extended half so far, and is not likely to last nearly as long, as that of Air. Miles Newton.\" The bull-headed squire muttered something of people who did not know when they- were well off, of the county's having been very well as it was, and of his private aversion to interlopers, whether they were lawyers or globe-trotters, who meddled with what did not concern them. He then went on to state, with the greatest candour,"], [285, "GOING BACK TO FOXCHESTER. 275 that he had been introduced to the new man, in Westmacott's office, and had entered into con versation with him, desiring to be civil and to ascertain what he was like. All the thanks he got was, that the fellow did not hesitate to say the line of railway, on which they were at that moment, ought to have taken another curve, which would have carried it close to the speaker's park-wall, as had been planned in the parlia mentary bill\u2014 against which he had set his face. When this was pointed out to the new-comer, he had the coolness to assert that personal interests ought to give way to public convenience. He had taken it upon him, afterwards, to say that the scale of wages \u2014 which he was discussing with Westmacott \u2014 was too low to support the labourer. while the rents were too high, and the leases too short, to give fair play to the farmer. It was \" the cow and the three acres \" business. They were all tolerably familiar with such rot spoken by stump-orators on radical platforms. This was a meddling, levelling democrat who would make mischief all round. At least, the poor fellow, who was going, had not interfered with his neigh bours, nor proposed to make fiddle-strings of what better men than he knew, by the experience of generations, was the right order of things. Ah! there he was with his pretty daughters, poor"], [286, "276 A BUBBLE FORTUNE. things ! at the other end of the platform, prepar ing to take their departure. Hang it! he could not let them go without expressing his regret. The train was not only due, it was in sight, when the autocratic old squire stumped up, fol lowed by7 one or two gentlemen lagging behind him, feeling the full awkwardness of the situation, yet fain to show their sympathy. \" So sorry you are going, sir,\" cried the leader, in a voice hoarse with calling to his dogs for the matter of half a century, but full of cor diality for the occasion, \"sorry to have seen so little of y7ou while you were here, but dear ! dear ! who would have thought y7ou'd have gone so soon? Here to-day and gone to-morrow, it is the way of the world, the lot of humanity. Airs. Stacey,\" (naming his wife) \"would have gone over and offered to do what she could for the young ladies, bidden them good-bye if nothing else, but we only heard you -were leaving at once, late last night. The next time y-ou are in the neighbourhood you must allow us to put you up at the Beeches.\" The roar of the train drowned the rest of his words, and Harry could only bow his acknow7 ledgment; but the last Nanny saw of the group was the bluff squire standing, bare headed, look ing after them and waving the hat he held in"], [287, "GOING BACK TO FOXCHESTER. 277 his hand, while his friends in the rear raised their hats in unison. She was glad of the little demonstration, she believed it was sincere for the moment. Some how, its kindly regret touched and softened her. She felt if she had known those people better and dwelt among them, they7 might have been her friends; that, even knowing the little they did \u2014 they of her and she of them \u2014 some of the ladies would have followed the example of the gentlemen, if it had been in their power. She recalled the fact that not only Air. Westmacott but Airs. Williams in her fussy, and Braintree in his solemn, way, with more than one of the younger servants, had looked honestly sorry to see the family go. It gave her a more whole some, candid, tolerant feeling towards those she left behind, towards everybody. It furnished her with greater hope and heart in anticipation of the reception of the family, shorn of their glories. at Foxchester."], [288, "CHAPTER NX. THE NATIVES, LADY GOSFORTH AND CAPTAIN PERRY. THE natives of Foxchester behaved uncom- monly- well under the circumstances. Nanny7 went so far as to declare the townspeople made her think better of her kind. The good behaviour was by no means confined to the old doctor or the vicar's niece, or the three old ladies who had been kind to her mother. The Coxes, Prings and Coppocks outdid themselves. \" Glad to have you here again, old man, we'll do our best to make up to you for the loss of the big-wigs you've left behind you \u2014 had enough of them, I daresay, eh?\" was the roughly jocular, well-meaning greeting of some of Harry's former cronies. \" Oh, Nell, we're charmed to welcome y-ou back, \" cried the Coxe and Pring girls, \" we have missed you so, we want you and your sister for"], [289, "THE NATIVES. 279 a pic-nic to Nine-Elms while some of Bertie's friends are with us. Yes, Nell, and there is to be a fete at the opening of the public park, which, you remember, old Air. Willis has presented to the town. We are going to be quite gay this summer, and we are so pleased that you should come in for a share of the gaiety. Our tennis practisings fell flat without you.\" Airs. Coxe and Mrs. Pring even renewed their invitations to the Newton family, to take up their quarters at one or other of the two houses, till the party could recover from recent worry and fatigue, and look about for the furnished apart ments, which must satisfy them in lieu of their old house. Nanny could not tell whether an aroma of superior gentility still hung about the dispossessed squire of Newton-Hayes and his daughters, or whether Foxchester was really touched and flat tered by their choice of a refuge. She felt she ought not to pick motives to pieces, but to be thankful for the friendly feeling shown. No doubt it is easier for poor human nature to weep with those who weep, than to rejoice with those who rejoice, but there was something more in the generous trait than could be thus accounted for. Harry Newton and his daughter Nell had always been popular, after a fashion, and they had borne"], [290, "280 A BUBBLE FORTUNE. their honours so meekly that it would have been difficult for even the hardest nature in the town to rejoice over their downfall. \" Little Aliss New ton\" had held herself aloof, no doubt, but she had not waited for a fortune to do that, and Foxchester could afford to be magnanimous and to treat her well also. Nanny7 felt it was like having coals of fire heaped on her head. She knew the sympathy and consideration \u2014 which were not always delicately expressed but which were genuine \u2014 were called forth by exceptional circumstances, were not likely to survive the first blush of the situation, and could not be expected to last, at their present high level, for any length of time. But she was ready to own it was pleasant to discover there was so much more heart in the world than she had given it credit for. It was small and mean of her to have been so sceptical. Poor Nell had been wiser and nearer the truth in her faith and trust, and Nell was an optimist, to this day7, in spite of what had befallen her, yet she looked so ill, though she made no complaint, that Nanny's heart bled to see her. As for Harry, in spite of what was left to him of his old philosophy, he fretted over his younger daughter in a manner which recalled to Nanny, with the sickness of a new apprehension added to her other anxieties,"], [291, "THE NATIVES. 281 ill-omened facts in the past. The girls' mother had faded out of existence while yet a young woman, all her sisters had pined and passed away, in succession, under the same scourge of con sumption. Nell declared nothing ailed her, and made the bravest efforts to be cheerful by day, and to conceal, from Nanny, her wakeful, restless nights, when the young heart rebelled against its fate. Ethel Pring or Milly Coxe would contrive to get Nanny aside, and ask her wonderingly and inquisitively if Nell had gone through an illness, during the year she was absent from Foxchester ; she was so changed, she looked ever so much older, she was not the same girl she had been when she left. Old-fashioned people shook their heads and whispered mysteriously, as Nanny sus pected, that \" Miss Nell Newton, for all her pret tiness and pleasantness, had clearly had 'a disappointment' on her own account, something quite apart from her father's loss of his estate.\" The gossips knew it by incontestable signs, fa miliar to the initiated, and, as Nell had evidently inherited her mother's constitution, there was no answering for the consequences. Yes, Harry had reason for the distress he was unable to conceal, and Nanny knew he had rea son, only she dared not measure the extent of"], [292, "282 A BUBBLE FORTUNE. the mischief, nor speculate what seeds of prema ture decline the mother's constitution had sown in that of the daughter. Nanny, in spite of her ability and energy, could do no more than Nell herself could have done in the position \u2014 trust in Providence, in the healing processes of time, in absence and oblivion, and in the strong religious principles and warm family affections which would balance, in Nell, a disastrous absorption in her sweet fleeting love dream. But if it had been Nanny, who was \" the woman forsaken \", she would have held up her head, set her teeth, and dis missed the unworthy man from her thoughts, however much she had suffered in the process. Nanny was grateful for having been let down to a lower social platform with comparative ease. Air. Coxe had taken Harry back into his office on the old terms. The negotiations which had to do with Nanny herself getting a post in the High School were not only pending, they were drawing to a successful conclusion. If Nanny was in trepidation on Nell's behalf, she was delivered from the fears for her father, which used to haunt and abash her. Harry7 had come out of the furnace a sadder and a wiser man. Generally, when a man stumbles on the brink of perdition and is only saved by the skin of his teeth, he is, if there is any good in him,"], [293, "THE NATIVES. 283 softened towards his fellow-men. He has a live lier comprehension of their dangers and tempta tions, he is gentler in his judgments on their failures. Harry's narrow escape had the reverse effect on him. It hardened him in the sense in which a good soldier is hardened. It gave him a keener insight into what easy-going humble and tolerant good-nature might lead to. He saw7, at last, that every man's path is encompassed with stumbling-blocks and pitfalls, and that, if he is to come out of them with honour in the day of account, and not to lend his neighbour a push in the wrong direction, he must walk warily himself and do his best to induce his neighbour to follow the example of all responsible, upright men. Harry might not be quite as complacent and agreeable a companion, as he was formerly, to Air. Pring and Alayor Coppock, but he was a truer friend on those occasions when he turned his back upon them. The old house in Paradise Row had, as it happened, stood unlet while the Newtons were reigning at Newton-Hayes, but it was not pos sible for them to re-occupy it, at once, much as Harry desired it. Their old furniture was gone. AIr. Westmacott, indeed, had forced upon Harry a small addition to his earlier loan, in order to meet the family \"wants\" at the crisis, and till"], [294, "284 A BUBBLE FORTUNE. the head was again earning an income. But that debt had to be paid back, with the others w-hich had been incurred, and the nearest the Newtons could approach to their former home was to engage lodgings in another house in Paradise Row. From the most available of the windows of this much shabbier and barer version of the old dwelling-place, Harry7 was in the habit of peering over into what had been his garden, which was at present lying fallow. He would try to ascertain what plants had survived the year's abandonment to neglect, and protest that he would sooner go to the owner of the house and offer to prune the wall-trees and standards as a labour of love, than see them go to rack and ruin before his eyes, while the place awaited a new tenant. Nanny resumed her old, half-German practice of marketing before breakfast. As she plodded to and fro, in the cool uncrowded streets, she would ask herself whether her going away- and coming back had not been the shifting scenes of a dream\u2014 if she could have had, only the other day, a housekeeper to receive her orders, a solemn Braintree to remind Nanny- of her duties, a train of servants at her bidding, a carriage like Cin derella's to ride in? Ah! the fairy godmother had withdrawn her support, or was it that Nanny"], [295, "285 THE NATIVES. had failed in some of the conditions of her higher estate and so forfeited her inheritance? One morning Nanny had been walking hastily, in order to get out of the \"tail\" of a shower, she had opened the house-door by means ofthe latch-key, with which her landlady had entrusted her, and was delaying for a moment in the small hall, for the purpose of depositing her dripping umbrella in the stand, when she noticed a trav elling cap, lying beside Harry's soft felt hat, on the hall-table. The Newtons were the only lodgers in the house, and the landlady7 was a widow, with no male encumbrance who would wear a travelling cap. But Nanny was too damp and limp, in her cotton skirt, to solve the mystery in the simplest manner, by walking into the sole sitting-room which Harry could afford ; she had also the breakfast-hour on her conscience, to hurry7 her in changing her dress. She had scarcely thrown off her hat, when Nell came flying upstairs to speak to her. Nell? Could this be Nell, the wan and languid Nell of the last few weeks ? She was transformed as if by magic, she was blooming and radiant as ever. She made no prelude, no disguise. She called out, with her whole heart in her voice : \" He has come, Nanny, at last, \" she stopped"], [296, "286 A BUBBLE FORTUNE. with a gasp of delight, like a child. \" He has travelled all night, he was so anxious to be here. It was not his fault. His father did not tell him, while he was still detained by regimental busi ness, and greatly puzzled by not hearing any thing of us. It was Lady- Gosforth who wrote to him \u2014 no, not from Paris, she has come back to London, where she has been laid up with lumbago.

I have heard the same doctrine spouted occasionally, of late, in real life, but I never could find that any good, not to say great, man had subscribed to it. I never believed one word of it, any more than I believed the talk of living being necessarily so expensive a process nowadays, and of its being incumbent on people to live up to the standard of their generation.

Has nobody the courage to make a stand against luxury and self-indulgence ? Why can't the grand sons and granddaughters \u2014 especially when they are young, strong and fond of each other, like you and Captain Perry \u2014 think and act for themselves? What is there to hinder you and y7our young man from waiting till he can save a little money7? If he can't save it, the more shame to him. I should not have a word to say to him in that case, if I were you. It is ill counting on dead men's shoes, but I may say this, his father must die some day, and then the entail can be farther broken, and the poor, drained, stripped, swamped estate sold for what it is worth, or put out to nurse, if anybody will undertake the arduous task, till it recover from its long sickness. There, Nell, do you think me a hard-hearted monster? Anyhow, I'm 'fixed', as the Americans say7.

He would have waited for his Nell till their heads were gray. He would have consented to go into \"a two pair back\" with her, like the most simple-minded and fearless of the officers of the past, to whom Nanny had referred, who did not dream that the plainest lodging and the homeliest fare could detract from his claims as an officer and a gentleman. He might be so sophisticated as not to like roughing it, and knocking about at home, in a manner of which he would have thought nothing if the object had been sport, or the locality the ends of the earth ; but he would have done it, and the vindication of his manliness, together with the possession of Nell, who would have cheerfully shared every act of self-denial, would have been his \" exceeding great reward.\" But Lady Gosforth interposed, she prevented the holocaust, such as it would have been, and the bitter struggle with AIr. Peregrine Saville. She was persuaded that she had taken an active part in promoting an alliance between the Newton and Saville families, when it had seemed a much more likely and desirable step. Her prejudices 19"], [300, "A BUBBLE FORTUNE. 290 were with the class to which she belonged, and with the privileges to which they clung; but she could not consent to be concerned in breaking an innocent girl's heart, the daughter of her old friend, her poor Tom's oldfriend \u2014 Harry Newton \u2014 and that in the hour of his second experience of adversity. She could not have anything to do with a young man's covering himself with disgrace. For, however his world might slur over his with drawal, there would be very7 real disgrace in Captain Perry's renouncing his suit to Nell Newton after he had gone so far as he had gone, because ot her father's misfortunes. Even the arch-AIephis topheles \u2014 Air. Peregrine Saville \u2014 was sensible that his very shady reputation would be several shades duskier, after that public demonstration at Briarley7 which had been followed \u2014 not by the announcement of the marriage of Captain Perry to the younger of the Alisses Newton, according to what had been long planned and intended \u2014 but by7 the sneaking retreat of the intended bride groom, consequent on the prospective bride's loss of fortune. Thus, when Lady Gosforth \u2014 believing that both Harry and Nanny would fully7 endorse thc propriety of the selection of Nell, as the chief recipient of her bounty \u2014 proceeded to make known the sum to her credit in her bank-book, in ad-"], [301, "THE NATIVES. 291 dition to her flourishing investments, and that she was prepared to settle a handsome portion on the one of her favourites who, in her estimation, needed it most, Air. Peregrine Saville, having a mature acquaintance with the Quixotic and Puritanical peculiarities of the son with whom he had to do, gave way after a brief resistance. He masked a wry7 face under a sneering smile, and neither did his reward fail him. He was on the eve of claiming the gentlest, most charitable and long-suffering of fair and fairly-endowed daughters in-law, with whom an unworthy7 elderly gentleman was ever blest. Nell could not do less, to show her affectionate gratitude to Lady Gosforth, than comply with her ladyship's request for a long visit on Nell's part, during which the trousseau might be bought, and the preliminaries of the marriage settled. Harry and Nanny were more than pleased that their darling should go out from them in the glad, natural way7 originally anticipated. Thus it dawned upon the slow comprehension of Foxchester that the Newtons were not such an unlucky family as had been confidently asserted, when they returned like bad halfpence from their fleeting enjoyment of Newton-Hayes. There was a certain glory reflected on the town and its daughters, by one of them being about"], [302, "A BUBBLE FORTUNE. 292 to marry the member of an old county family, the son and heir of a squire, an officer in what, the Pring girls were ready to warrant, was a fashionable regiment. Nell Newton had not done so badly with her beauty, for the credit of Foxchester, as had been feared. It required some magnanimity in the gossips, led by7 Alilly and Letty Coxe, to forgive the misadventure of Lady Gosforth's choosing to be in town out of season, and of Nell's company7 being wanted there, which made Foxchester lose the very pretty and improving spectacle of Cap tain Perry's courtship, culminating in the gala of a marriage. But to even this call on its forbearance Foxchester was equal."], [303, "293 CHAPTER XXI. A VISITOR. THE drama had not gone so far as Nell's marriage, not even so far as her returning \u2014 as she insisted on doing \u2014 to bid farewell to Fox chester before the ceremony7, w7hich was to be celebrated in Lady Gosforth's Parish Church from Lady Gosforth's house, to which Harry and Nanny were to go as valued guests. Nell had been brought to see that this was best, as Harry and Nanny had never doubted, for the marriage of a Saville of Briarley7, \u2014 however much the family had fallen \u2014 from furnished apartments in Paradise Row, Foxchester, was, to say the least, unde sirable. In the meantime, both Harry Newton and his elder daughter were suffering from inevitable reaction \u2014 reaction in a double sense. In the first place they were paying the penalty7 of the strain, to which they had been subjected on quitting"], [304, "A BUBBLE FORTUNE. 294 Newton-Hayes; in the second place they were condemned to look at the other side of what had been their joy and relief in learning that Nell was not to be the principal sufferer from the calamity which had befallen her father. Nell's great promotion in being, as the towns people put it, \"adopted by- Lady7 Gosforth\", as well as engaged to Captain Saville, had prolonged the interest felt in the Newtons' reverse of fortunes, and continued to cast, even in the family's eyes, a glamour over the growing prosaic ness of the situation, in reference to Harry and Nanny. It was from internal not external causes, that a certain sinking of heart beset the father and daughter \u2014 especially the daughter. Nanny was indignant with herself, and found the only consolation for her weakness in the determination that she would overcome it presently. Every thing was so much better than she had dared to hope, so little permanent harm had been done by7 the sudden rising and equally sudden falling of fortune's scales. She and her father were in a very7 similar position to that they- had originally7 occupied, and added to it was the great gain of Nell's assured happiness. It would be unpar donable in Nanny7 not to be devoutly- thankful that matters were not worse. But was the posi tion the same? Nanny and Nell had hardly7 ever"], [305, "A VISITOR. 295 been separated in their lives before, and now not only was Nell g-one on a long visit, she was going, for all the years to come, in a parting which was only second to that of death. Nanny trusted the pair w-ould have many happy meet ings in the future, but it would no longer be a case of next neighbours at Newton-Hayes and Briarley ; the sisters would not be together again. would no more be one in heart and interest, as in the past. In fact, Nell was drawn back into the sphere out of which her father and sister had passed. Nanny had sufficient confidence in Captain Perry's kindness of heart and affec tion for the woman he was about to make his wife, to feel certain that he would not seek to make this fact an obstacle to her periodical in tercourse with her family. Nevertheless, the fact remained, and Nanny's common sense told her that this barrier \u2014 raised by different circles, differ ent habits and tones of thought and feeling \u2014 however much family affection might strive against it, would rather increase than decrease with years. Is it possible for an experience to be repeated with identical results?

The whole thing is a disap pointment and a failure. It is all the worse because we recall, in a baffled spirit, our first favourable impression of the experiment, and are mortified to discover that we have been mistaken, or that we have grown fickle in our tastes \u2014 hence the collapse of a cherished scheme which we took pains to realize. In some of the Newtons' difficulties at Newton- Hayes, both father and daughters had looked back on Foxchester and their life there, not without tender regret. Harry had been like a fish out of the water, for a time, without his regular office- work \u2014 now, when he had resumed it, he complained he could not get back into the swim, he had lost touch with his work. He had no heart nor spirit for its drudgery. He drooped in the hot summer weather, as he had not drooped in his earlier reverses. He was an older man, in spite of what was perennially- youthful in him, much of the elasticity7 of his nature was gone. He had missed his garden which he had worked with his own hands, no gardens half a dozen times larger and finer, worked by7 his gardeners, without any7 trouble or labour on his part, had been able to make up to him for the deprivation."], [307, "A VISITOR. 297 He had not yet been reinstated in his Paradise Row garden, but even if he and Nanny saved money enough to rent and re-furnish the old house, she had a melancholy foreboding that it would never again be as it had been. It would not be like the house to which Harry had brought home his young wife, in which Nanny and Nell had been born, in whose holes and corners they7 had played many a merry game. Nanny doubted very much whether Harry would resume his gardening with even a shred of his former zest; she could fancy him hiring a jobbing gardener to do the work, while Harry looked on, with his hands in his pockets, hardly exerting himself to call his subordinate to order, or to correct him when he was about to commit a fatal blunder. The gloss was off everything, even off the former life at Foxchester of which the recollec tion had lingered in their memories. There was no longing to take up afresh the real business, with its petty7 worries and pinching cares, and to abide by7 it. Nanny's personal plans were overturned by7 Nell's approaching marriage. They had not been very brilliant plans, nor had they been inordin ately dear to her. She was not a born teacher, with a burning desire to impart knowledge at"], [308, "A BUBBLE FORTUNE. 298 first hand. She would have preferred to cultivate such gifts as she had, while she was still in the heyday of youth, trusting to communicate, what was good in them, in an indirect fashion to her neighbours. Still, she had clung to the independ ent and equal companionship, the intellectual stimulus of a Lligh School. It was equivalent to out-of-doors interests and a welcome variety in the monotony of her daily routine. But Nell's marriage put an end to all this. It was not to be thought of, that Harry- should not have the undivided care and attention of one of his daugh ters, and be left when he had leisure, or was ailing, to the tender mercies of a landlady. The idea of the post in the High School had to be given up. Nanny must content herself with \" the common round, the daily task \" of the home duties, which she was clearly called upon to dis charge. It really did not matter that they were rendered only the more irksome to a creature of a highly-strung temperament and of inexhaustible energy-, because of the enforced idleness of life in \"apartments\", as contrasted with life in a house of which the candidate for occupation is the mistress ; on the management and embellishment of which she may \u2014 however poor in other resources \u2014 bestow, to her benefit, some of her superabundant mental ardour, until she end by"], [309, "A VISITOR. 299 acquiring her share of the true house-mother's beneficence and content. The weather had the sultry oppressiveness of a hot August (Nell was to be married long after the close of the season). The rooms in the lodg ing in Paradise Row were close and stuffy. The landlady7, a worthy enough representative of her class, who had generally7 a great respect for \" ' little Aliss Newton ' as was a young lady as knew her own mind, and did her part without troubling other folks more than she could help, and without putting them out by shilly-shallying, \" was affected by the state of the thermometer, or by private cares, irrespective of the fact that the Newtons paid \"like clock-work,\" for she had been cross all the morning. It was Foxchester market-day and Harry would be detained longer than usual at the office, so that Nanny could not count on his company till late in the afternoon. She would have been almost glad to have called on the Coxes or the Prings as a relief from her own undiluted company, and for a change, but everybody who could get out of Foxchester at this season was at the sea-side or paying visits. Nanny could only put on her hat and saunter along the shady sides of the quiet streets, for air and refreshment. Suddenly, somebody coming along in the opposite direction and 'choosing the"], [310, "A BUBBLE FORTUNE. 300 sunny side \u2014 as if English sunshine was a matter of preference, or of utter indifference to the pe destrian\u2014caught her eye. For it was somebody whose figure stood out, unmistakably, from the figures of the farmers and townspeople standing about in half drowsy- confabulation. Yet it was a figure which, in its very strangeness, had a cu rious significance and familiarity for Nanny. The slightly- slouching, but easy and alert gait was conspicuous among the lagging steps and weary attitudes which prevailed around. This was the distinguishing attribute of a recent acquaint ance, made in too striking circumstances to be easily forgotten. The face, with its brick-red complexion, told the same tale, and she would have known the quick interested glance, which took in everything and disdained nothing, among a thousand. There was a flash of recognition, which was not without pleasure, on her side, as he sprang with the lightness of foot of a man twenty y7ears his junior, across the street and held out his hand. \" Aliss Newton, I am very glad to have met >7ou,\" he said. They7 were everyday, easily-said words, but they had a depth of sincerity7 in their ring, which does not often accompany them. Nanny7 was bitterly ashamed of herself, she could have punished herself by every7 conceivable"], [311, "A VISITOR. 301 penance a moment afterwards. For the sight of him brought Newton-Hayes vividly before her, the green park with its spreading trees, the pretty spacious old drawing-room, of which Nell and she had been so proud to be the mistresses, and, before she could keep them back, the tears sprang to her ey7es. What would he think of her? What would he believe was the origin of the tears held back with the greatest difficulty ? He saw them, as he saw everything, and he did not seek to hide from her that he saw them. He was not accustomed to hide what he saw. In all his busy, honourable career he had never had anything to conceal. He w-ould have spared, as far as he could, the feelings of anybody with whom he had to do, but, naturally, it was difficult for him to keep to himself what he was swift to observe. His ow-n frank, honest face, with its buoyant intelligence, fell \u2014 more even than Nanny had seen it fall, when she told him that her father could not accept concessions from him, and that they were better left to tnemselves. \" Have I made another blunder in coming here?\" he asked, in his point-blank fashion, while he showed mani fest anxiety with regard to her answer. \" I thought I might. I could not sail for Australia without making an attempt to see you all again. We are cousins, you know. I have been trying"], [312, "A BUBBLE FORTUNE. 302 to find out what has become of my mother's family, and it seems the members, who were lett, went to America twenty years ago. Aly7 mother had no children by her second marriage, and your father is the nearest relative I have\u2014 to my knowledge.\" She had not thought of this, but the informa tion was not wanted to soften her. \" No, no, it was not a blunder,\" she told him quickly, \"it was kind of you to think of us in that light. My father will be pleased to see you, as I am. Come home with me and wait till he returns from his office.\" He took her at her word, without a moment's hesitation, walking along by her side with evident satisfaction. Nanny7 thought she could count on her father, she believed it would be a different thing for him to receive and entertain Aliles Newton at Foxchester. It would be something apart from acknowledging and leaving him master of New ton-Hayes. She could depend on the claims of kindred \u2014 which the winner in the brief passage at-arms was urging \u2014 and on the obligations of hos pitality having their due weight with Harry in Foxchester, after the interval which had elapsed. When Nanny and her father's cousin arrived at Paradise Row, she found the entrance to the house, for which they- were bound, encumbered"], [313, "A VISITOR,. 303 by a huge hamper, over which the landlady, with restored good humour, was fussing. \"Look here, Aliss Newton,\" said the good woman, \" this here hamper is for you, leastways, it is addressed to your pa, and as it is marked 'perishable' it is bound to hold fruit or vege tables or dairy7 produce, so I was just awaiting your permission to open it, and put the contents in the cellar or the larder.\" The bright beseeching eyes of the donor of the hamper were again fixed on Nanny, in earnest entreaty and deprecation. \" It is only a sample of the present year's fruit and vegetables \u2014 in which Tomkins tells me your father is a regular connoisseur. There are the latest of the strawberries, and the earliest of the apricots and peaches, with the cucumbers and vegetable marrows from his frames, and the asparagus from his pits and such stuff. Oh! and there are some flowers for you and your sister \u2014 you always had flowers about, I remember, I take it you are fond of them, perhaps you would like to lift them out for yourself.\" Nanny could not do otherwise. \"Nell is from home, \" she said, \" therefore you must be content with my thanks for your mindfulness. \" As she took up the flowers and bent over them to enjoy their beauty and fragrance, again she was"], [314, "304 A BUBBLE FORTUNE. carried back to Newton-Hayes, to its restful peace and bounty, to the refined mellow charm wrought by the culture of generations. She could not help herself, she hailed the sight of each flower as the renewal of a delightful acquaintance. \" I know where that passion-flower came from,\" she said eagerly, \"it grows on the warm outer wall of the big conservatory, and these salvias \u2014 what glorious blues and scarlets, are from the bed below. The banksian roses climb up the pillars of the small old hot-house. They were a mass of bloom last season. \" She would not have believed, if she had been asked the day before, that she had kept in her mind a minutely7 accurate plan of the place in which she had only dwelt for a year, so as to assign unerringly each flower to its locality. While she continued to touch the flowers with lingering tenderness, she came upon a mass of carnations and picotees \u2014 \"Why,\" she cried, \" these are some of the picotees which Tomkins was raising from slips, with the greatest care, to which he pinned his faith as certain to get him the first prize at the Atherney Flower Show;\" she looked at Aliles Newton speculatively7, \" did he give them to you? or did you gather them yourself?\" she inquired solicitously."], [315, "A VISITOR. 305 \" I gathered them, \" he answered, readily and impenitently. \"I should not have dared to do it,\" she told him, with a twinkle in her grave eyes. \" You will have a bad quarter of an hour the next time you go into the gardens.\" \" What were they for if not to be gathered ? \" he asked naively, \" and if they were not yours they were mine.\" 20"], [316, "306 CHAPTER XXII. \" THE ONLY PROPER AND POSSIBLE COMPROMISE. \" NANNY was right in her estimate of her father's feelings. Sufficient time had passed for the soreness of defeat to be allayed. He had lost the haunting sense of shame and mortifica tion which had rendered his cousin's presence intolerable to him. After all, Harry had done Aliles Newton no wrong, Nanny, and a greater than Nanny, had withheld Harry from a das tardly act, which would have been his own, and not his cousin's, ruin ; and he had certainly saved his rival from what \u2014 even with the assurance of ultimate victory \u2014 must have been the annoyance and delay of a law-suit. Harry7 was never the man to bear a grudge long. With his simple confiding nature recover ing its balance, under this new aspect of affairs, he felt in a position to be magnanimous. He was proud to show the wondering Foxchester"], [317, "\"THE ONLY PROPER COMPROMISE.\" 307 gossips the terms on which he stood with the cousin who had dispossessed him of his inherit ance. The tie by blood, slight as it was, could now make itself be felt. Harry, no longer heavily hampered by opposing forces, could be suffi ciently at ease to look, listen, and recall early colonial associations. He could ask innumerable questions about the growth of Australia, and be more and more interested by what he heard in reply. He fell insensibly into addressing his visitor as \" Aliles, \" \" Old chap, \" \" Aly boy, \" as he had heard his \u2014 Harry's \u2014 father call Aliles' father. Harry would tell the present Miles stories he remembered of the elder Aliles, his wife and their first-born children \u2014 \" the jolly little kids \" of whom their boy playmate had been fond. The ice of separation, estrangement, and strife was rapidly thawing. Nanny listened, half wondering, half thankful. She felt inclined to make much, on her own ac count, of_ the unexpected pleasure of renewed contact with the rare intelligence, the single hearted manliness and large-minded unconventional aims of a primitive great man \u2014 for that the Australian engineer and pioneer had in him the first elements of greatness, remained her unwaver ing conviction. It was a treat to hear his animated conversation\u2014 all the fresher that it was unvar-"], [318, "308 A BUBBLE FORTUNE. nished \u2014 on his travelled experiences. There was no lack of native refinement in the talk, and it is the only refinement which is not skin-deep, the refinement of a thoroughly7 candid and generous nature, with a dash of heroism in it, and, for a background, the reverence ofa man who realized what was great and sublime, because ofthe absence of littleness and vanity in his own character, and because of his capacity for veneration. Like his capacity for love, it had not been frittered away bv perpetual trifling. It had been fostered by lengthened periods of solitary7 communion with his own spirit, and with the Father and Redeemer of all spirits, in that primitive wilderness which may be savage and desolate, but is never sordid and squalid. Nanny enjoyed walking about Foxchester and its neighbourhood with a man who condes cended to everything and everybody7, as if he had never ridden a pilot-engine for more miles than she ventured to sum up; nor laid the foundation of a bridge, whose mighty span and giant supports he devised, and would live to see one of the wonders of the Colonial world; nor dammed . the waters in a gully- until the arid country7 beyond \u2014 parched and rent with thirst \u2014 blossomed like the rose at the stroke of a magician's wand, in the haunts of the lizard and"], [319, "\"THE ONLY PROPER COMPROMISE.\" 309 the snake. He was as much interested as a child would have been in whatever was new to him, or in whatever suggested comparisons and con trasts with institutions familiar to him, in the trade and the traffic, the shops, the dwelling-houses, the people, everything and everybody intro duced to his notice. He was a man, who prac tically did not understand the meaning of the word blase. He called nothing common or unclean ; such terms as \" snob \" and \" cad \" seldom fell from his lips. If he had dwelt habitually in Melbourne, or in Sydney, or even in Brisbane, he might have had a chance of being as sophisticated as the rest of the world, but he had been almost as much a denizen of the bush as if he had been a native. It was against the rough malpractices of the bush, when it began to have a sprinkling of inhabitants \u2014 the roaring camps, the diggers' stations where diggers' law was as yet but par tially established, the drinking bars, the betting shanties \u2014 that he was chiefly driven to testify with an earnestness, the quiet sobriety of which was more impressive than the fiercest denun ciations. Miles Newton had gone to one of the Fox chester hotels for his fortnight in the town; by the second night Harry had insisted on installing his cousin under the same roof with him, in a"], [320, "A BUBBLE FORTUNE. 310 spare bedroom which the landlady kept in reserve to let to a visitor of her \"family\", in the phrase by which she appropriated Harry and Nanny. The satisfactory point was, as Nanny congratulated herself, that she could have no doubt he was comfortable and happy in iiis quarters. He could make himself equally at home in a hut or in Government House. Just because he had been accustomed to knock about, as he said, and he had learnt to put no exag gerated value on externals. He was not dependent for his amusement on a billiard-room, nor even on a gun-room, though there had been times when he had been called upon to shoot \u2014 both in self-defence and to fill an empty larder. He had liked the library- and drawing-room at Newton- Hayes the first time he saw them, and he occa sionally referred to them with undiminished plea sure. But he could also appreciate the Paradise Row lodging-house parlour, with the dainty, womanly contrivances by w-hich Nanny strove to soften its bareness and brighten its dinginess. When Lady Gosforth heard that Aliles Newton was paying a voluntary acceptable visit to Harry, she highly approved of the flag of truce, and promptly- requested the new Squire of Newton- Hayes to do her \"the honour\" of accompany-ing his Foxchester cousins to town and of being present"], [321, "\"THE ONLY PROPER COMPROMISE.\" 311 at Nell's marriage. The invitation was accepted as readily as it was given. Everything seemed to promise the most Christian charity and amity between the kinsmen, in the near prospect of Aliles Newton's return to Australia for an indefinite period. Why then should the recently received relation, whom everybody had accepted as a man and a brother, in addition to his being the rightful heir of Newton-Hayes, take it upon him to disturb the harmony established so lately? He was rash enough to do it, by seizing an opportunity, when he and Nanny were alone together in the parlour, to come up to the chair in which she was sitting by the table, on which her work-basket stood, with a face sufficiently anxious and set in its urgent appeal, to frighten even a courageous woman. \" I wish to make a proposal, Miss Newton \u2014 Cousin Nanny,\" he said with desperate determina tion, \" I do not know what I would not give to have you on my side.\" \" Oh ! don't spoil it all, \" she cried vehemently, \" when you are going away ; it cannot be and we are all so happy and friendly as it is.

I can vouch for this however, that whatever you touch grows nice, homelike and beautiful under your hand. I cannot tell if that is true of all women, I have not known many, but I would not give a straw for the woman of whom it could not be said. You will not abandon me and Newton- Hayes to deterioration, emptiness and ugliness?\" She was so taken aback that she sat and lis tened to him in total silence, and perhaps it was the first time that Nanny Newton had been sub dued and silenced. He went on in the singleness of his heart \u2014 \" I'll tell you plainly what I want, Cousin Nanny. Of course I am not worthy of you, I have knocked about and been so desperately busy all my life that I have not acquired much I should have liked to possess.

You and my cousin Harry would not go back to your own house at once, that might be too trying for him, poor fellow ! but we should all take the voyage to Australia together, first. He would see the old places he knew as a boy, and likes to hear about to this day, now that his interest in them is revived; it would do him all the good in the world and make him young again. I cannot help thinking you would like it too,\" ran on the manly- wist ful voice, \" you would breathe the fresh air of the bush and live with only a tent-covering between you and the sky, you would see the blue gums and the grass trees and the great pines we have talked of. When I had put my railway lines into good hands and disposed of my shares, we might, if we cared to, come back and settle down for good, in the house that was our fathers'. Your father would have grown ac customed to the arrangement and have ceased to mind it.\" \"Do you really mean it?\" asked Nanny, look ing him full in the face, with her lips parted and her colour coming and going, \" are you not cheat ing me and yourself \u2014 only I don't think you could cheat anybody even if you tried \u2014 with"], [325, "\"THE ONLY PROPER COMPROMISE.\" 315 some deep-laid scheme of atoning to us for hav ing to give up Newton-Hayes? Are you not speaking out of your pity, which is very good of you, but very maddening to me?\" \" Pity ! \" he exclaimed with such unfeigned surprise that it was wonderfully convincing. \" Well, I suppose I have been pitying myself if I got an unfavourable answer, when I might have been better employed; but you won't blame me too severely for that when you have some thing to do with it ? \" \"And can you \u2014 a man like you \u2014 really wish a young woman \u2014 quite a foolish ignorant young woman \u2014 like me, to share your life, with its wide far-reaching horizon ! \" \" Do you doubt it ? \" demanded Miles Newton, still in puzzled bewilderment that anybody \u2014 Nanny above all \u2014 should suspect him of pretending what he did not feel to the bottom of his heart. \" Then you pay me a great compliment, and I am the proudest and happiest woman in Eng land to have it paid to me,\" said Nanny straight forwardly, while her eyes began to droop and her cheeks to flush with the very pride and happiness of which she spoke. He took her in his arms and kissed her like the true and ardent lover he was, as a natural preliminary to telling her: \" We'll be married"], [326, "316 A BUBBLE FORTUNE. at the same time and place as your sister and Captain Saville, I can manage it all,\" declared the man of energy, \" I am sure your friends will agree to it, for, look here, my dear, I ought to go back to the Colony by the next Alail but one. If it had not been for you, young lady, I should have been off a month ago, so that the blame will fall on your small shoulders if you keep me dangling here much longer.\" The announcement of Aliles Newton's wishes, which it seemed were Nanny's wishes also, was a new shock to the man whose consent was asked, but it was an agreeable shock this time, to which he had no difficulty in accommodating himself. In fact, Hany's imagination, which it was not easy to fire, had already been kindled by those traveller's tales bringing back the misty charm of visions he had held. \"When the breeze of a joyous dawn blew free In the silken sails of infancy.\" Harry experienced a kind of home sickness for grape vines and prickly pears, for rolling plains clothed in tufted grass, blazing here and there with gorgeous flowers, on which wild parrots in their brilliant plumage alighted appropriately, over which pattered and tramped such mighty"], [327, "\"THE ONLY PROPER COMPROMISE.\" 317 flocks and herds as made the wealth of the patri arch sheik Abraham. \"I'll go and have a look at Australia again before I die. There is nothing now to hinder me,\" said Harry exultantly, with a wavering colour rising for a moment in his face. \" I'm with you, Aliles, my boy, as your father was with mine half a century ago. The position is somewhat reversed, 1 grant, but what of that? It is not lost that a friend gets and the best man is entitled to win, eh, Nanny7 ? I'll show you Red Rock Falls, and the spot where mother used to go to look out for father coming home at night-fall. I wish we could have had Nell with us to listen to the laughing jackasses and watch the tricks of the honey bears, but we'll bring her such a cage full of cockatoos as the Zoo itself will not be able to match. I declare I have the scent of the yellow wattles in my nostrils already. Yes, Aliles, I'm your man, and Nanny here will go with us, as you say, and take care of us.\" It was significant, not of Harry alone, but of all who knew Nanny Newton well \u2014 the great engineer being no exception \u2014 that, the chief idea which the ivory-faced, gray-eyed little woman sug gested was that of a domestic queen, a house mistress and mother, though she might never bear"], [328, "318 A BUBBLE FORTUNE. children. The first and last thought of her was that of a ministering spirit born to bear and share the burden of humanity. Nanny did not belong to the clinging dependent sisterhood whose abiding notion of womanly triumph and bliss is to be cared for, to be saved trouble and worry, to fascinate universally by7 the simple exercise of their graces, to be indulged and petted! She was as humble at heart as the best, but she did not desire to remain a child all her life. Nay, even in her childhood she had been a wise helpful little woman. Her province \u2014 immeasurably- the higher of the two \u2014 was to care for others, rather than to be cared for herself, to pet in preference to being petted, and very inspiriting petting hers was calculated to be. As it happened, Nanny and Nell were fated to be next neighbours, but in their affectionate intimacy there was a reserve on the one side unsuspected on the other. The same was true of the close comradeship and tender friendship which existed between Aliles Newton and his wife.
