More than this, he knows that she seems conscious of her inheritance, has taken up the dead woman's mantle, and with her feeble arm strives to guard his interests and to provide for his comfort. \" I never had to send my children to learn their lessons in their lives,\" boasted a proud mother, warranted in her boasting ; \" they knew it was their duty to learn their lessons, and they did it, in their own fashion, faulty as that might be.\" Fathers and mothers are partial judges; but these statements were consistent with truth ; for I knew by my own observation that the remarks were true in each case. There are such things as consciences in B"], [16, "Trustworthiness. 2 children just as there is original sin ; and if the con sciences got as fair play as the sin, there would be many more trustworthy men and women in the world. The treatment must be judicious, in order not to put out the tiny spark of light by a torrent of idle mockery and sarcasm \u2014 not to blow it up into a forced and factitious brightness which must finally give way to blacker darkness than if no light had ever shone. \"Let the child enjoy itself \u2014 don't trouble it with such notions. Got some task imposed upon it which it is un happy because it has not done. Pooh ! don't bring it up righteous overmuch, \u2014 a horrid little prig and pharisee. Come, Janey, and I'll tell you how we got on when we were girls, and how little bones we made of our tasks. Of course we detested our governesses at home and at school, and got the better of them whenever we had the chance. My child, half the stories you read, or will read when you are a little older, by some of the most famous authors of the day, will show you how ridiculous those poor women are, and what petty tyrants they can prove. Did I know it in my own experience ? Why, not exactly. I am afraid our teachers were as much put upon by their pupils, as the pupils were put upon by the teachers. I think that now, and think that it is just what should be ; for girls' spirits should not be broken, and girls should be girls. I am sure boys were no better than girls \u2014 to judge from the stories I have heard my brothers tell of cribbing, and of copying the recitations which they ought to have had by heart from slips of oaper in the sleeve or under the desk. That was very"], [17, "Trustworthiness. 3 like lying and cheating, do you say ? and Miss Mentora is kind to you ? I hope so ; she is paid for it. But you must not use hard names with regard to trifles, Miss Janey, or learn to sit and condemn your elders.\" That is only a wilful exaggeration of the common moral standard held up to a child's conscience, \u2014 in care lessness, I grant, rather than with the deliberate intention of dulling and diminishing its light. A rarer, but unquestionably a still more fatal practice, is morbidly to stimulate the child's moral sense so that it precociously ponders and weighs every little word and act, classing them as virtues or crimes. The sensitive child is prematurely worn out by this sort of moral casu istry, which it is simply impossible to maintain for any length of time. At every second word it pulls itself up in case it should be guilty of the shade of an untruth, and is ready to fall into fits over an omission in its prayers. Being loudly applauded for its tenderness of conscience, finding as it grows older that it cannot maintain this rigid discipline, and knowing something of the horrors of an accusing conscience, the child is likely to become reckless and despairing. Conscience itself may be thrown to the winds ; and the promising child may develop at last into an unprincipled and unfeeling girl or woman, as impracticable and profitless a subject as Christian philanthropists can sigh over, and struggle to restore to a right mind. \u25a0 \" A tender conscience is one thing, and a diseased conscience is another thing,\" said Dr. Chalmers. Undue forcing and stimulating, either in body or in mind, in B 3"], [18, "Trustworthiness. 4 physics or in ethics, tends inevitably to disease and decay. But while trustworthiness is implanted as a gift,\u2014 one of the best gifts in the early dawn of some savoured natures, \u2014 and its cultivation as a grace in all natures is difficult, God forbid that any one should say such cultivation is impossible. Read what the Apostle Paul writes to Philemon of the slave Onesimus : \" which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable to thee and to me ;\" and again : \" perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest receive him for ever.\" I would fain be cautious lest I should dishearten you girls to whom I have spoken before, and with whom, if you would let me, I would make common cause, calling you dear old friends as well as young friends \u2014 reflections of my own youth, and of youth dearer to me than my own. Do not be too vexed when you think how inattentive and thoughtless you have been and are ; above all, for pity's sake and truth's sake, do not dream that you cannot amend these errors and grow always more attentive and thoughtful. It is true \u2014 but it is only one of those half truths which are so dangerous in ignorant and evil hands \u2014 that youth is a time of quick pulses and swiftly-changing emotions, when the strange, personal mystery of life is powerful and engrossing; therefore youth is also a time of special temptation to fickleness and selfish indifference to our neighbour. No patient older man or woman will refuse to acknowledge and to make due allowance for this fact. But youth is like wise the best sowing time for every good and noble"], [19, "Trustworthiness. 5 fruit; the fit training-school for every just and generous action. There is another error into which I have greater fear of you girls falling than into an excessive disparagement of yourselves and an absence of faith in your own capa bilities of improvement, although that too is a peril. I am afraid lest you should fall under the immense delusion of mistaking your faults for merits, of hugging to your hearts as the crown of your girlhood your poor little vanities and giddinesses, your sheerest day-dreaming and castle-building. I know, and I confess the knowledge with vexation, that you are not solely to blame for this misconception. Such notions are fostered by what you read in many of the books of the day. I do not mean the \" fast \" books which, for the sake of your modest womanliness as well as of your good taste, you had better let alone. These books are written entirely and con fessedly for what is called art \u2014 which is not Christian art \u2014 and for so-called fame and pay. The books of which I speak are written by able men and women who profess and practise better things ; and who, if they have not something of the heroic in their own lives, are at least honest and industrious. The last-named writers make the chief attractions of their heroines something else indeed than wicked self-abandonment and criminality. But these attractions have nothing to do with virtues\u2014 unless virtues consist of beauty, simple inanity, gamesome blitheness as of a young animal, pretty airs and arrogance, decked out with a few graceful epithets and references to young fairy princesses and butterfly queens, who are sup-"], [20, "Trustworthiness. 6 posed to be redeemed by just a little natural affection and passion. At the same time, these most unheroic heroines are permitted, with admirable consistency, to be guilty of irrational imprudence, weak and cold-hearted self-assertion, slightly veiled under another name, and empty-headed coquetry, always coarse in its essence. I do not admit that such models would be anything but despicable for girls, even if they were to continue girls. Seeing, however, that this is happily not the case, and granting a broad margin for the growth of human character, what sort of middle-aged women, married or single, will the fairy princesses and butterfly queens make ? What kind of companions and helpmeets will they prove for earnest and struggling men ? Are they likely to form sagacious, gentle, long-suffering mothers and guardians to another generation ? Re member that the sudden transformations of heady girls into thoughtful and self-controlled women occur only in novels, which, whatever their genius and their charms of style, are, in this instance, only poor travesties of nature. Look about you and judge for yourselves. While you may thank God for the amount of work done by feeble hands, and for the progress which the silliest and most foolish may accomplish, by God's grace, in a higher life, you will not see \u2014 and it would not be right that you should see \u2014 magical changes. Writers who thus involuntarily or deliberately lower the standard of women may give you two reasons for their conduct. They may say that they take women as they find them; and so are true to life and to art. Then"], [21, "Trustworthiness. 7 they may urge that they do their spiriting for innocent amusement and lawful profit; not didactically preach ing sermons in disguise, with saints and angels for heroines. If the artists say so, I must answer that they have been unfortunate in their experience of women and of life. My acquaintance, like theirs, has included many girls, with regard to whom, longing and striving that they should have a high ideal, I do not think that I can have been too indulgent in my estimation of their girlish nature. Yet I have been happy enough to know and love girls for their practical Christianity, as shown in their self-denial, their pure and refined tastes, their unassuming humility and tender-hearted charity \u2014 the very qualities which my brethren and sisters in art deny to the girls of their circles. Neither is it true high art to degrade young women into frivolous butterflies, or vague, helpless dreamers. (The last, however, is the stock idea for modern innocence on the part of all who follow the French school\u2014 whether they know it or not.) There may be, no doubt there are, exceptional women, girl Brutuses, unhappy in their surroundings, or so wretchedly educated as to be only swathed and crippled babies, left to grow up in swaddling bands, while they are really wise and virtuous women in disguise. But, as a general rule, the best women and the true heroines \u2014 the heroines of Walter Scott and William Shakespeare \u2014 at no stage, present the low type of dreaming dolls or vain fairy princesses. Coming nearer to the present day, and to the creations of women whose claims to"], [22, "8 Trustworthiness. be artists cannot be questioned, we may take Jane Austen's heroines. These have been unfairly cha racterised, considering the age in which the artist lived, as being deficient in feeling and in elevation of tone. Yet, take the most faulty of them, and, however desirous of regard or ambitious of influence, they are uniformly dutiful, right-principled girls, trying to be upright and contented, shocked at what they see to be worldliness, deceit, and ingratitude, and delivering their unhesi tating testimony against wrong. Elizabeth Gaskell's Mary Barton, a motherless, ignorant, hard-nurtured young workwoman, with the tinge of levity and the silly aspirations of such a girl, still craves and gropes after better companionship and deeper satisfaction ; while Margaret Helstone and Molly Gibson are delicate, well nigh perfect delineations of tender, cultivated girlhood and womanhood. The dissenting minister's adopted daughter in Felix Holt, \u2014 to mention the heroine of a living author, \u2014 is like Mary Barton in the germ and the development. Now to my subject of Trustworthiness. I would fain show how valuable, how invaluable it is, and how much it implies \u2014 reliability, stability, fidelity. If a promise is given, it wall not be broken ; if an undertaking is begun, it will be brought to an honourable end, at whatever cost of time and trouble, and in face of the relinquishment of what is pleasant or profitable. Consider how trust worthiness not only rounds off and completes a sound harmonious nature, but how it goes far to restore the balance of good to a disordered and bitter temper ;"], [23, "Trustworthiness. 9 how, without trustworthiness, the most magnanimous and kindly of human beings becomes but a grievous failure. Bring the consideration still nearer home, and reflect how full a mother's heart is, and how entire her serenity, when she declares, \" I can count upon ray daughter; to leave her in my place is to be there myself.\" Mistakes may happen with the daughter as with the mother ; but the girl will not be diverted from her work, or distracted from her purpose. She will not rebel, in word or in deed, against the seclusion or the drudgery ; nor will she repine at standing aside and letting the pur suers of pleasure pass her by. She will not be depressed by being misunderstood and misrepresented, not even at losing something on which she had set store. Precious as that thing might have been, or as she might have fancied it to be, more precious to her is her pledge \u2014 the trust reposed in her. What a weight lies in the determination of brothers when they resolve \" We vvill tell Anne or Katey or Dora. At least she will do her best for us ; put aside her own interests, beat her brains and think and plan for us ; never turn against us or betray our confidence !\" How supreme is the award of a husband as he gladly shares his laurels with another who is yet not another but a second self. \" I could not have achieved this or that success without my wife. She knew what was in my head all along. She was con stantly providing for what was to come, not sparing her self, nor flinching when put to the test. She encouraged and comforted, braced and calmed me, while she con cealed her own reluctance to give up this or that indul-"], [24, "TrustwortJiincss. 10 gence. My wise was the best friend I ever had j I hardly think I could have accomplished my great object had it not been for her.\" In the end, don't decline an apprenticeship to trust worthiness by despising its application to what you please to call trifles. Don't think of waiting until you can be a Chatelaine, a governess in the old sense of the word, as Clara Eugenia was governess of the Netherlands ; until you can hold out a Latham House with a Countess of Derby, or reorganise a military hospital with Florence Nightingale. The idea is as absurd in fact as it is false in theory. Training and discipline are essential to the originally trustworthy in order that they may turn their trustworthiness to the best account. Training and discipline are doubly, trebly necessary to those girls and women who have grown up careless and unobservant, casting everything aside which stands in the way of the gratification of their tendencies, or even of their passing whims. The teaching of the Bible positively forbids the irrational imagination that a man or a woman, capable of fulfilling the highest and noblest trust, does it by a divine instinct and without any previous deliberate effort. Regeneration may be instantaneous ; sanctification must be gradual. At the close of the parable of the unjust steward, it is written that he who is unfaithful in a little is unfaithful also in much, and the question is asked, ii we are unfaithful in dealing with our own, who will intrust us with what is another's ? There is incipient trustworthiness in the child who day after day, will strive to learn, to the best of iu"], [25, "Trustworthiness. 11 slender abilities, the lessons apportioned to it ; to do the little pieces of work appointed for it by papa or mamma ; to be punctual and particular in feeding its birds and rabbits. There is growing trustworthiness in the girl who, in midst of her more worldly education, will consci entiously prepare for her confirmation or first communion, believing that the preparation is not to terminate with its immediate object but is to go on through life \u2014 through death, till its great end is attained ; and who will wait upon and minister to the infirm old and the helpless young \" like an old woman,\" \u2014 discreetly, with constancy and cheerfulness, when the charge is committed to her. Trustworthiness, in one of its finest and healthiest features, is seen in the girl who, in the full flush of her girlish occupations and enjoyments, relinquishes the most en grossing of them, because she has kept in mind her father and mother's commission, and must take care that all her engagements be respected, and because, come what may, she must never forget her worship of God her Father in heaven, and her service to men and women, her brothers and sisters on earth"], [26, "Trustworthiness. 12 HOW POLLY CULPEPPER KEPT HER FATHER'S CASTLE. Within a short distance of the great city of London lies the river port of Greenwich, dignified by an ex-palace and hospital \u2014 one of the noblest buildings in the country \u2014 and by that perfection of parks, a people's park. Time, with the well-nigh appalling growth of the big city and of railways, has reduced Greenwich to little more than a suburb of London, slightly salt-flavoured on account of its approach to Gravesend, and of the naval element still lingering about the palace-hospital, although that has jndergone another transformation, and can no longer be represented even in engravings with one-legged pensioners stumping along its broad terrace and plying telescopes at every available corner. Greenwich Hospital has ac quired to some extent the air of a body from which the spirit has departed, and bears a forsaken look, a baffled \" What-will-you-do-with-it ?\" tone : still it remains a grand relic of national gratitude to national heroism, as well as a magnificent pile to the honour of the greatest English architect. While the Thames flows free and wide, in spite of the teeming traffic which befouls its waters, while the huge Spanish chestnuts and elms outlive the centuries, and do not disdain to stretch their gnarled branches over mechanic and nursery-maid because they once shook their young leaves above statesman and queen, Green wich, even though aristocratic whitebait dinners and"], [27, "Trustworthiness. 13 humble tea-gardens were abolished, would be a choice specimen of aqua-marine among the local gems of Eng land. Memories haunt the varied picturesque ground \u2014 haunt even the quaint brick houses \u2014 memories of Anson, Collingwood, and Nelson ; of bluff King Hal and his ill-omened weddings ; of his daughter, good Queen Bess, with her soldier-sailor-poet-knight Raleigh and her better servant Burleigh ; of William's Mary, who sought in her short day to cause her King to live in the hearts of his people. The chief highway to Greenwich was still a watery highway. Steamboats had not yet torn up the channel below and darkened the canopy above with puffs and plumes of black smoke. Barges had just given place to wherries, and the waterman and the hospital were alike in full force. The coaches from Dover ran on the great road across Blackheath, and were liable to be stopped on any winter afternoon or moonless night with a \"Stand and deliver\" from highwaymen in crape masks and mounted on tall, bony horses. And Greenwich had the special advantage of including in its individuality a great deal that was already old, strange, and foreign. Such was the Greenwich on which Polly Culpepper's pon dering eyes and the bright eyes of her contemporaries looked down. Polly's father had been a captain under Howe. While still young in the service, he had married ; but his wife had only sailed with him on one station. Ever afterwards, so long as he continued on active service, his reunions with his family were few and far between,"], [28, "Trustii. 'ortliiness. 14 being nothing but Hying visits when he returned home with despatches, or for the purpose of having his ship overhauled, or of being overhauled himself, in conse quence of having been wounded, or during irksome uneasy intervals when he was off duty before being posted to another ship. Captain Culpepper's family was very limited, its only members being his wife and his child Polly. His wife contrived to retain a lively recollection of her husband by his letters, though he was no great letter-writer. And there was need she should, when he did not sit by his own hearth above once in six years, and that for a period which did not exceed six weeks or two months. As for Polly, she hardly knew her father : she had only seen him three times in the course of her eighteen years. When she had reached this important epoch in her history, he retired, or rather, to his burning indignation, was drafted on an idle life and half pay, as disabled \u2014 a result which was due to a combination of causes. He was now sixty-five years old, was permanently crippled by a gun-shot in the knee, which he had received twenty years earlier, and he carried about with him the lasting consequences of yellow fever caught in the West Indies, and of ague got off the coast of Newfoundland. It was a great misfortune for Polly Culpepper not to know her father ; and it was a misfortune not so easily remedied when the two were brought together, as some may think. It must be borne in mind that Captain Culpepper was a naval officer of the old school. He was a roufh, stern old man, having few resources or sympathies beyond"], [29, "Trustworthiness. 15 his profession ; and he was, besides, embittered by the inevitable crosses and disappointments of life. Polly was a shy, sensitive, somewhat fanciful, solitary child. Mrs. Culpepper was neither inordinately sensitive nor fanciful with regard to one side of Polly's filial relations. The first idea the child had received from her mother was that her father had been dreadfully vexed,\u2014\" as cross as twro sticks,\" \u2014 when she was born, because she was a girl, and not a boy. And it seemed as if Captain Culpepper was the more vexed that it had happened on board his own best-beloved ship, the Sea Horse. He had scarcely looked at the mite Polly, and the stubborn fact had decided him to send his wife and child to settle on shore. He had always declared that if he got a son he would try to keep the boy on board. From the time that he could creep, he should be reared to run up the rigging, educated in the cock-pit, and trained to be a brave seaman, and to become perhaps a great commander, like the boisterous idols of Captain Culpepper's imagina tion. But the Captain did not know what to do with a crying girl ; and so he banished her and her mother summarily to their native shore. Polly received the next impression of the amount of satisfaction she gave her father when she was a delicate demure little girl of seven. The Captain had then come home for a breathing space between his long cruises. Polly did not have sufficient tact to conceal her surprise and dismay at his loud, violent ways. She had mortified and offended him beyond expres sion by not being able to tell every half and Quarter"], [30, "Trustworthiness. 16 point of the compass, and by cowering and putting her hands over her ears when, on the anniversary of the reduction of Cherbourg, he chose to fire the cannon which he had planted close behind their house. And no wonder Polly cowered. She thought at first that she was shot dead, and then that every window in the house was broken, and her dear, prettily-behaved doll blown over the elms, over the wall, over the great green bank, across the main street of Greenwich, down some treacherous alley, plunged into the river and \" drownded like a rat.\" This was Polly's and her maid Amyatt Hubbard's acme of misery and misfortune. Captain Culpepper would say in Polly's hearing, \" I cannot think whom that child favours,\" meaning, what relation poor little Polly honoured by being like ; and he would bend his shaggy brows, and pull petulantly at his shirt-collar as he spoke. \" I am sure it is neither you nor I, Nancy,\" he would say ; for he was fond of his wife in his own way, when he had time to think of her, and proud of her fine colour and her high spirit, both of which Polly wanted. Polly, as she herself judged, was quite grown-up now. She had learnt to know her father a little better since she had lived in the same house with him for a year : she could look him in the face when he condescended to speak to her, mix his grog for him without being ready to drop the bottle, or play a game at cribbage with him when her mother was not at hand. Nay, she had thrilled with innocent pride and pleasure on hearing him grant that she was not so useless a monkey as he had supposed. She"], [31, "Trustworthiness. 17 had once or twice even gone so far as to ask him to spin a yarn for her of his sea voyages and sea fights ; and he had not diverged on these occasions from his common track of growling over the promotion which had passed him by, and raging at the Admiralty and the men in it. She had listened to these stirring narratives with hand stilled in her needlework, with flushing cheek and parting lips, till he was gratified and flattered by the interest of even so small an auditor. Nevertheless, Polly was still greatly frightened at her father \u2014 estranging and affronting him by her fright. She was damped by his presence, and disheartened by the gulf which lay between them. It did not help Polly that she was conscience-smitten, and shocked at this state of things, and that she had a con viction that Captain Culpepper, far down in the depths of his heart, had a natural liking for his ungrateful child. She knew, for her mother had told her, how manfully he had saved his prize money and kept it untouched, tha' she might not have so work for her livelihood or depend upon strangers when he and his half-pay were gone. He did not trust to her marrying \u2014 for who would fancy such a washed-out little thing, who resembled, by all the world, the nuns whom he had seen in Catholic countries . Anyhow, Polly should not want while he could lay up a penny for her. Polly's great refuge was her mother \u2014 a bright, cheery woman, much attached to her husband, much attached to her daughter. By some statesmanship of the heart Mrs. Culpepper managed that the two allegiances should not clash. c"], [32, "Trustworthiness. 18 You may conceive what a trial it must V.ave been ts> Polly when it was proposed that her mother should go down into the heart of Kent (Mrs. Culpepppr was a country-woman \u2014 a small squire's daughter) to see her old father once more in life, and be with her own people for ten days \u2014 ten years on a girl's horologe ; while Polly should take care of her father and of her father's castle \u2014 Formidable House, as he had named the compact brick structure, from a notable prize of Lord Howe's. It need not be added that Polly's mind was not the easier because she would have Amyatt Hubbard, in her most trying and opinionative stage of life, and her two cousins, Ben and Bill, who lived with them, to take charge of and look after. Mrs. Culpepper had not indulged in such a little trip above twice since she was married. Till now, she had been the sole head of the house, and had everything to manage. Besides, the possibility of Captain Culpepper's turning up at any time, as he was apt to do, kept her more closely to her home than would otherwise have been the case. \" But I may go now, Polly, my chick,\" Mrs. Culpepper said, entering into a full explanation. \" Father is safe, and sure anchored for the rest of his days. I owe it to old father that I should take a journey to see him yet again. Dear ! dear ! what a favourite I was of his, and how he used to take me walking with him through the fields, and over the great manor coverts. And he gave me the fox's brush \u2014 that he did, Polly \u2014 which he won when the meet was down by our place, Little Plumstone, and I brought it with me when I married, and preserved it till it went with maggots.

Law ! to think I have not met some of them, my own brothers and sisters, since we were lads and lasses ! I wonder if Jowler and Ribbons be dead or alive, and if there will be any change on the old vine over the porch, and the tiger lilies in the roundel (I was always main fond of tiger lilies) ; there wasn't the last time I was home in summer, but that is good ten years gone. How time do fly, to be sure ! I think you'll not want me, Polly, since father is here, and quite in a tidy temper, with his knee so well and his ague not over plaguey.\" \" I'm afraid I'll not manage everything,\" urged Polly, doubtfully. \" Amyatt will help you, child ; she knows everything, and can advise you. You won't be too dull, with your little cousins Ben and Bill to run about with and chatter to. Father has his company \u2014 his younker he is so fond on \u2014 not like every younker, else I should not trust my Polly to keep house without me, and Lieutenant Sam in and out from his lodgings half a dozen times a day, as your father will have him. But he is a good, steady fellow, is Sam Bryce, besides being a son of an old friend of father's, and having been himself one of father's own younkers. Father do blow me up, Polly, when I call 'em his pets ; but they were that, and nothing else, for all his sending them to the yard-arm, and threatening them with half rations. He do love a forward, brisk boy and his tricks, and you ought to have been a boy to set father np ; but you couldn't help being a girl, and I would not C 2"], [34, "Trustu worthiness. 20 have had you anything else\u2014 a dear, good girl, the greatest comfort to me.

Let me see\u2014 when you have writ and posted the letter, I shall certainly have it in a day or two. I think brother Noll calls for letters every market-day. When I hear that you cannot do without me, Polly, I shall start at once, though it were in the dead of the night ; and not altogether sorry to, either, for after the first day I shall weary monstrously to be with you and father again, to see what Yatt is about, and if the carrier has called, and how everything is getting on in my own house at home.\" Polly rather imagined the last was a loving delusion of her mother's. The hale, happy-tempered woman was neither given to fret, nor to anticipate evil. She would"], [35, "Trustworthiness. 21 enjoy keenly this reviving and renewing of old associa tions, as she would also enjoy returning to the present conditions and the dearest, closest ties of her life. It was good that it should be so. Polly was as far as possible from grudging her mother her perfect holiday. It was also good to be able to put the best face on things \u2014 to look on them with strong faith and settled contentment. But the attainment of these things is sometimes a little trying to the young and inexperienced, who as yet have such a capacity only in the germ. Polly did not wish that her mother should do more than twinkle away a tear at leaving her home for a short time ; but she did wish that Mrs. Culpepper would be a little more sympathetic and impressed with the difficulties of her position. If she would but consider how terrible Captain Culpepper was, notwithstanding that he was a worthy officer and worthy husband and father, and how fidgetty and cross-grained Amyatt Hubbard could make herself. As for Polly's young cousins, Ben and Bill, they were lads of nine and eleven, sons of a dead nephew of Captain Culpepper's. They had been sent to Greenwich, and boarded with their kinsfolk, for the benefit of a naval education. Polly cer tainly did not wish to be harsh to young boys, but to her, who had never known a brother, these embryo younkers m embryo ducks and blue cloth were too often veritable powder-monkeys, shirking all authority, and flinging themselves into all manner of mischief. Polly's father might be fond of boys ; he certainly tolerated these young relations, and he did go so far as to propose"], [36, "Trustworthiness. 22 to give them private lessons in navigation ; but these lessons were conducted with such fierce shouting, striking of the fist on the nearest table, and abuse of sea language, that, even when her mother was at home, they were one of the banes of Polly's life. Lastly, there was Lieutenant Bryce \u2014 Lieutenant Sam, as Mrs. Culpepper and Amyatt called him \u2014 who was out of a ship at present and lodging in Mrs. Creasy's spare whitewashed room. He might be capable at sea, else her father would not be so proud of having had the training of him when a midshipman ; but Polly could not believe that such a short awkward young man would board an enemy like a hero. Had he been a tall, dashing young fellow in blue coat and sash, like Harry Caven dish, who was also at home waiting to be appointed to a fresh ship, Polly could have believed it. Indeed, Harry had detailed similar exploits, not braggingly, but out of the fullness of his heart, and the stories seemed to come naturally from a Cavendish, which they had no call to do from a Bryce. Lieutenant Sam might be an honest inmate of a family : Polly did not mean to say that there was dishonesty in his brick-red face and prominent red eyebrows; on the contrary, there was that gruff aspect which one somehow asso ciates with honesty. But how Lieutenant Sam could serve her as a friend as well as he served her father, when he hardly ever spoke to her except to pull her up and remind her of her duty, expressing himself with absolute tartness in contradicting some of her sentiments, Polly would leave her mother to explain."], [37, "Trustworthiness. 23 Formidable House was a prim, precise, modest red brick mansion of the era of Anne. Its shell bore no relation to the character and habits of Captain Culpepper. The house was at some distance from the river, so that it was only after mounting with his crippled knee to the second story that the Captain could command the water with his glass, and \" rake \" any craft which demanded inspection. The house had two long windows on each side of the front door, and five long windows lighting the story above. The windows and the door were not faced with white, but the bricks were arranged so as to give a faint representation of the rays of the sun, or of eyelashes turned back, round the door and round each window. The steep red-tiled roof boasted a low stone balustrade. There was a little beaten and bare court before the house, surrounded by a wall, which was en tered by an iron-shod gate, flanked with pillars having bullet heads out of all proportion to the size of the house. Happily, to redeem it from total ugliness, the pillars were not the only sentries. At each side of the house, as gay and gallant supporters, throwing their grateful shade over it, and mingling with its warm red their livery of cool green in an altogether charming manner, stood two or three full-grown Kent elms. Behind the house was a yellow, sandy terrace, where the Captain had planted his cannon\u2014 genuine French cannon of his own capturing ; and below the terrace and the cannon, running a little bit down the hill, for the house stood on a ridge close to Blackheath, was the narrow vegetable and flower garden, protected in its turn by an ivied wall and sheltering"], [38, "Trustworthiness. 24 trees, where Mrs. Culpepper cultivated her peas, and Polly her roses, in loving proximity. The risk of the situation and the bleakness of the heath were lessened and relieved by Formidable House having been built almost in an angle of Greenwich Park wall. There was a wealth of rich wood beyond, which, to be sure, however acceptable to the eye, might have served to hide so many later Robin Hoods and Allan-a- Dales, had not the wood been the setting to the Ranger's House and to a side street of pleasant dwelling houses which ran boldly up Croom's Hill parallel to the Park wall. So Formidable House was not at all isolated or dreary, and though Polly stretched her fluttering wings and craned her slender neck with the restlessness of a young bird to see life beyond the home precincts, her heart was sufficiently true to turn to it after all, \" like the needle to the pole.\" She would have fought battles for its merits against a graceless assailant with all the staunch ness which her father had displayed in helping to capture the Alcide or to reduce the forts on the Delaware. Inside, Formidable House presented very much the arrangements of the day. There were sitting-parlour and kitchens below, and company-parlour and spare bedroom, with the Captain and Mrs. Culpepper's room niched in between, above; and still higher, under the sky-lights, cells or berths, fresh and clean, and cold or hot according to the season. These berths were devoted to Polly, Ben and Bill Culpepper, and Amyatt Hubbard. The whole house bore tokens of Mrs. Culpepper's country"], [39, "Trustworthiness. 25 extraction and of the Captain's seafaring vocation. By way of ornament, there were horns and peacocks' feathers, faded rose-leaves and lavender crumbling into dust, as well as foreign nick-nacks of bamboo and cane. shells, coral, and lumps of ambergris. The Captain always kept his clothes in his original kit, and had his case with his knife and fork \u2014 the handles of agate \u2014 placed beside his plate. In the sitting-room, with its green walls and matting for floor-cloth, its Chinese screen, and its pervading odour of tobacco \u2014 for the Captain smoked in season and out of season \u2014 there were hung models of the Charlotte and the Sea Horse, under full canvas and close-reefed, together with engravings of Blake, Sir Cloudesley Shovel, Rooke, Anson,\" Brave Boscawen,\" and, of course, of Howe, the sailors' \" Black Dick.\" Sitting there, Mrs. Culpepper was in the habit of manufacturing list slippers for the Captain, and Polly of trying her taste and skill in painting thread-papers and working ruffles. If the weather was very wet, the Captain, when he was not lying back in his leathern easy-chair, studying the newspaper in silence, or sitting at his desk faithfully keeping his log of observations on the weather and the tides, wrould pace up and down within these narrow bounds like a caged wild beast. Captain Culpepper was a stout little man with a weatherbeaten, hawk-like face, in which the nose and the eyes had suffered most from exposure to different climates. The nose had a strong tinge of copper colour ; the eyes \u2014 good keen eyes, to begin with \u2014 were inflamed and ferrety, as though with a latent blaze which was"], [40, "26 Trustworthiness. ready to break out on the smallest provocation. His dress showed the old unsuitable combination of \" check shirts and gold lace ;\" but his ample red waistcoat and gilt buttons, bearing the impression of an anchor, were supposed to atone for and set off all coarseness and dishabille. His hair, however, was never in dishabille. It was always done up in a punctilious, pugnacious queue. This was the handiwork either of Mrs. Culpepper, who had learnt the trick, or, failing her, of Mrs. Creasy, the widow of the Captain's stroke-oar, who had also acquired the masculine art from officiating on the stroke-oar's queue. Captain Culpepper, like many another aristocrat, preferred the services of either of the two women to those of the Greenwich barbers, who, being potentates in their own persons, were apt to have ideas of their own, and over whom he could not hector. It need hardly be said that Polly had never been trusted to touch a grizzled hair of her father's head, though she had \"done\" her mother's still unsprinkled brown hair into the turrets of curls which, to that good lady's entire satisfaction, lay in the shadow of her turban when she was going to a party at the house of any of the admirals then affecting Greenwich. Polly had no hairdresser for her own locks, not even when she went to parties ; but, then, her little head was in a crop, and only required a wet brush to set up its soft light-brown clusters. Mrs. Culpepper, when at home, was a handsome, blooming woman. She always wore turbans of some material or another, and cheerful, richly-toned dresses of crimson or purple, full blue, or green. None of your waters-of-the-Nile (though she had all a sailor's wife's"], [41, "Trustworthiness. 27 exultation in a naval victory), or London smokes, or serges for her, Polly, on the contrary, was mostly in white of an after noon during the summer months, as girls in her station appeared at that time. In winter, when there was hail and snow in the wind, and a crisp coating of ice on the Blackheath ponds, Polly adopted a scarlet cloak and hood, like a robin-redbreast mounting its bravest colours when the cold was most intense. She was a slight girl, with little colour, and not very regular features ; but she had one of those wistful, tender mouths which, to the people who know how to value them, put the pouting mouths and the straight-lipped mouths alike into the shade. Polly's eyes were like wells in a desert \u2014 clear, pure, living points, showing with wonderful effect in the comparatively dim, pale landscape ; and Polly's head in its crop was more finely shapen and poised than that of swan or greyhound. Amyatt Hubbard, the only remaining member of the family, had been a comely maiden in her day, notwith standing that she had remained a maiden. Her person and face had grown angular and haggard in her linsey woolsey, her apron with a bib, and her huge cap ; whilst her mind was also in that dissatisfied transition stage which comes to some women who have lost their youth and have not yet accepted their middle age. For the first few days of Mrs. Culpepper's absence, Polly's regency promised to be an unmitigated triumph. The effort which the girl made to choke down the sob \u00bbvhen she had seen the last of the handkerchief waved"], [42, "Trustworthiness 28 persistently f-om the window of the Dover coach upheV. her for a time. Not only did she put restraint upon herself, but the Captain, Amyatt, Ben, and Bill, put restraint upon themselves also. Everybody was amiable, and all the machinery of Formidable House worked har moniously. Even Lieutenant Sam was mindful of Polly and tolerant to her. He trotted out Captain Culpepper to tell his awfully tragic or pathetic stories, of the sinking of the Vengeur with her crew of two hundred Frenchmen going down with her timbers ; or of the dusky Red Indian squaws finding food for their children on the track of two hostile armies. All this he did to engage and entertain the girl sitting there at her patient needlework, not dreaming of being displeased with the two men's sea talk any more than with the tobacco smoke that curled round her in a cloud, out of which her head looked very young and fair contrasted with those engraved heads of Sir Cloudesley, Brave Boscawen, and Black Dick. Ben and Bill went to their naval school and returned from it like clock-work, occupying their spare hours in constructing forts, after the fashion of Cherbourg and Delaware, in the garden, under the superintendence of the Captain, who rated them sufficiently during the operations. Amyatt knew her own mind, and was fairly respectful to her young mistress. All the drawback to the enjoyment lurked in the sense that it was only too bright to last. The mischief began with an apparent boon bestowed on Polly. She received a formal invitation from the Misses Cavendish to take a dish of tea with them, at no"], [43, "Trustworthiness. 29 distant date, along with some other young friends of the Cavendishes. They would have a stroll in the Park or games in the house afterwards, according as the May evening would permit. The Misses Cavendish wished to introduce two London cousins to the beauties and delights of Greenwich and its neighbourhood, and bespoke Polly Culpepper's assistance in the laudable undertaking. Polly, in a flutter of excitement and happiness, took the card to her father, who blurted out his permission to her : \" Go if you like, child ; I suppose your mother would have granted you leave; I shan't hinder you.\" Polly's mother would have said yes, and would have sympathised warmly in the girl's natural welcome of a little \" junketting.\" But Polly's mother did not sym pathise very cordially with Polly in her hankering after the Cavendishes. Simple woman as Mrs. Culpepper was, she knew a great deal more of the world than her daughter, and was well aware that the fascination exercised by birth and rank, together with the attraction of light, impetuous ways, belonged to that kind of pleasantness which is just too pleasant to be whole some. At the same time Mrs. Culpepper knew no reason why she should go so far as to forbid Polly's intercourse with the Cavendishes \u2014 including Harry, with regard to whom Mrs. Culpepper often told Polly roundly, that had Lieutenant Sam been such another vapouring flashy fellow, he would never have had the freedom of Formidable House with its mistress's consent."], [44, "1 rustworlhiness. 30 Polly was a dutiful girl, seeking to obey God's com mand to honour her father and her mother, both because the law was in the Bible and because it was written by Him in her heart ; but she took leave to think her mother a little prudish and prejudiced in the matter of the Cavendishes. The invitation, referring as it did to an evening yet almost a week distant, began by unsettling Polly. She took to rehearsing the programme till she had got up all the particulars and was full of them, and commenced to study the weather with regard to the details of her dress. She felt annoyed when she was interrupted in her calculations and drawn into another channel of interest. She would no longer look at Ben and Bill's fortifications, and so infused into the boys a distaste for their game which was half-play, half-earnest. She would not listen to Amyatt's proposed amendments on the dishes that Mrs. Cul pepper had checked off before her departure. So Amyatt went into a huff, murmuring in audible accents that her old mistress would have heard all that \" Yatt \" had to say and would have thanked her for her sugges tions. But what airs Amyatt's young mistress, who was no better than \"a babby,\" gave herself! If Mrs. Culpepper would but stay long enough away, Amyatt had a mind to teach Mistress Polly better manners. Polly also proceeded to be very high and grand to Lieutenant Sam. He had also forgotten himself, and, in answer to a question from the Captain, had stated that he had no invitation to the Cavendishes, and would not have cared to go to their party if he had been invited,"], [45, "Trustworthiness. 31 because the Cavendishes and their friends were people for whom he had no manner of liking. To display more plainly her indignation at Lieutenant Sam's rudeness and injustice, Polly was particularly gracious and accessible to Harry Cavendish in Lieutenant Sam's presence. Flarry had called to see if Polly would allow him to come on the appointed afternoon, and escort her straight to the twin chestnuts in the south-west corner of the Park, where, on second thoughts, his sisters had decided it would be better to meet and have tea in the open air, as the May afternoons were so warm, and tea in the Park would be so agreeable. He believed his sister Betty had picked up two fiddler fellows who would play for the little party, so that, if they chose, they might have a dance on the sward before they returned home. Polly had not the slightest individual objection to this alteration in the arrangements. Nay, she thought it would be very delightful, and she really forgot for the moment to ask herself whether her mother would have equally approved of this new plan and of the licence involved in the removal of the company from the chaperonship of Lady Maria Cavendish. Lady Maria was only the girls' stepmother, and however she might countenance them in their \" doings \" at the Grove, she would certainly not trouble herself to accompany them to the Park, exposing herself to an attack of lumbago in their service. Everything was driven out of Polly's head, as she tried to excuse herself afterwards, by the circumstances of Lieutenant Cavendish's call. He made it at the hour"], [46, "Trustworthiness. 32 when Captain Culpepper was in the daily habit of com paring his chronometer with the clock at the Observatory, and of having his chat with his acquaintances among the pensioners. But Harry was so thoughtless \u2014 like all the Cavendishes \u2014 as to sit till Lieutenant Sam came in to go with the master of Formidable House and play a game of bowls on the heath. Polly did think that Harry Cavendish sat too long even before he was confronted by Lieutenant Sam, and that it was inconsiderate in him to do so, both because of her mother's absence and of his knowledge of her father's temper, which caused her to tremble for the humour in which Captain Culpepper might receive the visitor. Harry Cavendish was not a favourite of the Captain's, any more than of Mrs. Culpepper's, and Amyatt might be spiteful and \" dare \" her master in order to tell him how long the young spark had been on the carpet, and if so be it was the Captain's wish Miss should dally in idleness ? As it was, Harry Cavendish, by a happy hit, was gone just before Captain Culpepper arrived, puffing and blow ing, too late for his appointment. Harry had looked so handsome and eager with his chestnut curls, his bold eyes, and the sort of recklessness which is apt to throw a glamour over quietly brought up girls, that Polly freely forgave him for the painful heartbeatings and flushings of the face which his indiscretion had cost her ; while she bore a grudge at Lieutenant Sam for staying where he was, after he had happened to become a hostile spectator of the interview. What right had Lieutenant Sam, by impli cation, to read lectures to her on propriety or anything"], [47, "Trustworthiness. 33 else, since he was such a bear as to return Lieutenant Cavendish's gay greeting with a growl just as if he would have liked to eat the offender up ? Polly let Lieutenant Sam see something far removed from such cubbish behaviour. She bestowed on Harry Cavendish a frank sweetness of look and word, such as she had never yielded to her father's and mother's friend. It may be inferred that Polly's conscience troubled her that afternoon and evening. She grew more and more fidgetty about the weather, and was ready to cry when she saw the changeable May sky get dark and showery. She doubted whether, if an approach to wet weathei set in, anybody in their senses could sip tea and munch biscuits, stroll and dance on the moist turf and undei the dripping trees of the Park. If she were mad enough to make the venture, her worked Indian muslin would become inch-deep in mud and be completely ruined. And if she would be a fright wearing the Indian muslin in its ruined state, she would be a dowdy in a thicker gown. It is hardly necessary to say that she did not wish to be either a fright or a dowdy before the London cousins, who might be cousins by courtesy, Lady Maria's brother the earl's daughters \u2014 Lady Marias themselves. Polly first wished she had her mother at home to advise her; and then she did not wish it, because she had a suspicion that Mrs. Culpepper, under any circumstances. would have prohibited the Indian muslin so early m the season. Lastly, she suffered from remorse for no*. doing exactly as her dear, good mother would have u"], [48, "T) -ustwortliiness. 34 wished, and for ceasing for a moment to wish that mother's return. Polly was out of sorts this evening. Captain Cul pepper's heavy foot, sounding dully in his passing and repassing between her and the light, set all her nerves on edge. Captain Culpepper's sneeze was as the blast of the trumpet, and the performance made Polly jump from her seat. Of course the Captain scolded, and demanded what the dickens she was about, while the boys sniggled. Polly, upset before, now actually cried a little, and the Captain bounced from the room, banging the door after him ; his exit being followed by a somersault on the part of the boys, and a request to Polly to \" pipe her eyes \" like such a sweet bantling as that which they went through the pantomime of nursing. The next day Polly woke refreshed, with the sun shining upon her in a glad and fearless blue sky. Ashamed of her folly, she determined to do better, and to seek assistance from the Psalms for the day and from her humble prayers. But ever so few steps easily taken in a wrong direction are hard to retrace ; and when germs of evil have found an entrance, who dare say when they will be rooted out, or what fruit they may not bring forth ? It seemed that poor Polly was to have her good resolutions immediately tested ; and, at the same time, that she was to be speedily punished for her sins of temper on the preceding day. Amyatt came to her before she was out of bed, and told her, with unmistak able irony, that she must get up and take in hand all her mother's duties ; for Mrs. Creasy had been, and told as"], [49, "Trustworthiness. 35 how that she had cut her thumb badly, and her youngest girl up in London in a place had sent word that she wished mortally to see her mother. So Mrs. Creasy was going to make a holiday of it, when she was maimed anyhow, and could not, at no price, for the life of her, do the Captain's queue this morning. Polly suspected that, if Amyatt had not been bent on bringing down her young mistress's pride by suffering her to get into straits, she might have averted the evil by plastering up Mrs. Creasy's thumb, and by not encouraging her in the project of visiting her daughter. Amyatt might at least have secured one of the Green wich barber's assistants before they were scattered over the whole town and neighbourhood, curling wigs and shaving beards. It was too late now to do so, and the Captain would not wait for tardy help. He would not remain in his own room till nearly dinner time, before his head should be made taut. He preferred coming out in a towering passion at the malignant con junction of circumstances; his grizzled hair hanging in elf locks down his back like a disordered mane. Polly felt for his discomfort \u2014 as any man or woman may do who has ever been reduced to a very low level of bodily satisfaction by not being able to command a bath, or on being deprived, from some extraordinary adverse fate, of the use of a tooth-brush. Still it was no trifling ordeal to stand the brunt of the Captain's rabid indignation, as he found equal fault with his coffee, his bloater, and his toast. The boys gulped their bread and milk and fled, taking care to spend the intervals between their school hours D 2"], [50, "36 Trustworthiness. elsewhere than at home, even at the risk of drawing down upon them still farther wrath. But Polly and Amyatt, the unfortunate womankind, were left, as is usual, to endure the full swing of their master's tyranny, even without the consolation of bearing it together and standing by each other. Amyatt, morbid like the Captain, stifled and stamped out relentings, and rendered Polly's position yet more galling by nagging at her about this dish or about that bit of cleaning, affecting to consult her while all the time she held up her decisions to ridicule. Polly did not cry again. The good stuff that was in her rose to resist injustice while she was able to remember her morning's resolutions, and to strive to keep the pro mise she had made to herself. The Captain's irritation was a passing cloud, and so was Amyatt's unreasonable ness. There was one bright afternoon to look forward to beforehand, and to recall afterwards, in the Cavendishes' party. And then mother would be home once more, and \"Jl would be right, and she would have done her best. Polly had gone out to the garden seat with her needle work for a breathing space, when Amyatt joined her quite pacifically, and addressed her confidentially : \" Do you know, Miss Polly, the Cap'ain's knee be gone wrong with his heat ? He have burst the wound, and is stemming the bleeding with his handkerchief.\" Such an accident had happened occasionally before. Mrs. Culpepper had been able to meet and overcome the danger, for doctors were not called in then, save when matters had gone pretty far, for Captain Cul-"], [51, "Trustworthiness. 37 pepper did not like doctors about him, any more than barbers. Nevertheless, Polly was dreadfully grieved and alarmed. Her father could not be suffered to struggle with the bleeding alone. Every thoughtful woman, how ever young and tender, has something of the instinct \u2014 grant ing it be but an ignorant instinct \u2014 of doctor and nurse in her. Polly ran in, dragged out all the old linen in her mother's drawers, and knocked at the door of her father's room, to which he had retreated. He grunted per mission for her to enter, and grunted a second per mission when she said, imploringly, \" Oh ! father, I am so sorry. Will you let me try and bind it up ?\" \u2014 for he was sitting, pale and faint from his futile efforts, although not otherwise subdued. Polly's trembling hands went about the difficult work ; and, in her anxiety, she pulled the bandage with ex cruciating tightness. \" Avast, you handless, good-for-nothing young hussy !\" shouted the Captain, tearing off the compressed cloth, and sending the blood in a spurt over Polly's hands and his own, thus leading Amyatt in the background to wring her hands and shriek in horror. Polly remained firm on her knees, though her lips were white. \" Father, you must let me do it ; I shall be more careful this time. Dear father, think how mother would have got you to undergo it, though she would not have forced you to suffer, as a wretched bungler like me has done.\" And the drops rained from Polly's eyes."], [52, "Trustworthiness. 38 \"I dunno,\" muttered the honest Captain, submitting reluctantly to the operation ; \" but the last time your mother twisted the string round my knee I 'most think I lifted my hand to her, though I never administered the cat-and-nine tails, not I, nor any gentleman in his Majesty's service, to the worst dog on board ship.\" Polly managed it, though Amyatt could never com prehend how a little, pale-faced, cossetted thing like Polly, who jumped when the Captain sneezed, and screamed at the sight of a mouse, found courage to face him as he sat panting and blowing, his wrinkled cheeks all aflame. The end sought was attained, and Polly, with great thankfulness, saw the bleeding stanched. Amyatt, with the fickleness of her sex, was now full of admiration for her young mistress ; she attended on her sedulously, and sought to stuff down her throat, by way of refresh ment, balm wine, herb tea, and slices of diet cake. But the first thing Polly did after she was able to quit her father was to sit down and write, with a somewhat shaky hand, that she could not now \" have the honour and hap piness of waiting on the Miss Cavendishes in the Park on the following afternoon.\" Polly turned a deaf ear to the protests of Amyatt, who knew what her mistress was about, and did not wish after all that Miss Polly should lose her bit of pleasure when she had been behaving so beautifully, for all the world like one of the ladies in the shows at the fair (and Amyatt meant the comparison as the highest compliment). \" I wonder if he will be vexed and hurt,\" Polly medi tated, pensively; \"his sisters would have gone out in"], [53, "Trustworthiness. 39 my case, however beaten they might have been at the time. I hope and trust that the danger is past, and that father will be pretty well again to morrow ; but nothing would tempt me to leave him ; I have no inclination to go with the Cavendishes now.\" The next thing to be considered was whether or not Polly should write and hasten the return of her mother, who had promised to leave in the middle of the night if sent for. Mrs. Culpepper's presence would be an un speakable relief, as Amyatt broadly insinuated ; offering a kind of atonement for her own derelictions in the bland, general confession, \" We've all been and gone wrong since missus went away, Miss Polly.\" On the other hand, would not the note of alarm be a cowardly grasping at deliverance for Polly in the selfish diminution of her mother's long-looked-forward-to visit to her old home ? If Mrs. Culpepper had borne all the weight of the government of Formidable House, and the difficulties of dealing with the Captain uncomplain ingly, nay, cheerily, during these many years, could not Polly bear with it for a few days or even weeks ? She would not be so unmagnanimous in her love for her mother. She was confirmed in not giving the recall by the opinion of Lieutenant Sam when he came to visit her father in the evening. The Captain permitted his old younker to make a cursory inspection of the bandaging, when the Lieutenant deigned to allow that it would do, though this turn was unnecessary, and that end was in the way. \" You don't think I ought to send after mother, and"], [54, "Trustworthiness. 40 hurry her home ?\" said Polly, in the dearth of counsel putting it beseechingly to Lieutenant Sam, as she inter posed and took the place of Amyatt as the Lieutenant was being shown out. \" Oh, no,\" he answered readily, and with a smile which lit up his face wonderfully ; \" what should you do that for, Miss Polly ? you are able to fill your mother's place.\" A little thrill ran through Polly at the words. She was sure that, fault-finding as he was, he did not utter the words in derision \u2014 and somehow she was gratified. In addition to the peace of a good conscience she had impressed both Amyatt and Lieutenant Sam. The admiration of the one and the approbation of the other were something worth acquiring, although she should never go to another party in her life. The reflection of this lustre of duty still shone round her in the early stage of the day. The Captain's knee continued to get better, and he was in a very improved temper, notwithstanding that Mrs. Creasy had not re deemed her character as vice-queue dresser by reappearing on the scene. Polly even ventured to propose that she should do up the ornamental tail which was in the habit of wagging stiffly and irately at the world. \" Stuff and nonsense, child !\" snapped the Captain ; \"do you think because you can tie a rag round a leg with a hole in it, you can dress an officer's hair? You must have a precious deal of confidence in your powers !\" In the teeth of this sarcasm Polly entreated for per mission as she had never dreamt of entreating before, and"], [55, "Trustworthiness. 41 succeeded, in the midst of much domineering on her father's part. She would not give way, and was not half so frightened as she had anticipated she would be ; for it is really only the first steps which cost a price, and she had paid her price in binding up the Captain's knee. She was suffered to roll round the queue and make it sleek, until the old gentleman recovered his self-respect by feeling his personal appearance restored in a degree to professional respectability. Then Polly went out to the garden, as she had done on the previous afternoon, and said to herself that she was glad the Cavendishes' party had got such fine weather, after all. The Park would surely beat the London parks hollow. She was sure it must surpass them in its bosky dells, with their milky thorns, the peculiarly tender olive green of its great sweet chestnuts, the boweriness of its Kent elms, the yellow, sandy foot-tracks intersecting its mossy pasture. Then there was the sea palace, than which only Windsor was grander, housing the throng of veterans having each his yarn to spin ; there was the Thames, blue or tawny, hugging the greenwood, with lugger, pinnace, and sloop shaking their cordage and flapping their sails in the wind, and with hints in the distance of tall masts, high hulls, lines of portholes, double and treble decks, be tokening the floating dwellings of the veritable sea-kings, the captains and seamen of his Majesty's navy. Polly, too, would enjoy the May sunshine in her own garden. All alone, yet within call of her father, she could wander among the pearly blossom of her white"], [56, "Trustworthiness. 42 lilac, and the dusky purplish blue of her true lilac, the flaunting luxuriance of her tulips, and the delicate fragrance of her jonquils. She had them entirely to herself, since the boys had deserted their half-completed brick forts and were spending their half-holiday else where. Polly said she was glad ; but her mind wan dered away to her festival-holding companions. She wondered what they would be doing \u2014 whether they were very merry, and if any one missed her. Amyatt had confirmed the conjecture that the London cousins were the Earl of Seaham's daughters ; so that Polly had missed the opportunity of being in high society and of seeing the latest fashions. But she did not care much for that now. What went to her heart with a keen pang was the thought that she had lost the chance of becoming better acquainted with Harry Cavendish, who might be posted to a ship any day. She had a correct misgiving that Harry, after some temporary chagrin, would not be slow to console himself by lavishing his bright looks and soft words on another girl, perhaps one of his grand relations ; and that if he did not happen to see her again before he sailed for perhaps a three years' cruise, the probabilities were that he would not waste another thought on her. Polly held her head erect at that idea, and promised herself firmly that she would not waste another thought on Harry Cavendish. But at thought of this a dull film crept over her eyes\u2014 a weight like lead fell on her heart. She imagined that, so far as individual happiness was concerned, she, a girl still in her teens, need not care what became of"], [57, "Trustworthiness. 43 her more, for she would never, never be happy again in this world. But though Polly could thus fall into gross exaggera tion, though she had wavered and come short of her duty at some points, she did not on that account abandon her principles and go over to the enemy. She did the very reverse, though she was a tender, soft-hearted, imaginative girl, with all a girl's weaknesses and tempta tions, and this simply because she was a trustworthy girl. In this lies the difference between the trustworthy and the untrustworthy. The first will in the main be mistress of herself, and will vindicate her faith at any sacrifice, even in opposition to the rising tide of passion. The last will show herself more or less a slave to her vanities and foolish impulses, and will be swept along beyond all barriers by every breath of fancy and head long inclination. The touchstone of trustworthiness or untrustworthiness was applied to Polly. This was a crisis in her history, although it was but partially re cognised by her as such. The result has to be recorded. Polly actually believed that she could never forget Harry Cavendish, so that in his forgetfulness of her she could not hope to be happy again in this world. Yet she would have died or been torn by wild horses sooner than have forsworn her dawning womanliness, and forsaken what she had come to know was her duty even in apparent trifles. She was not called to die bodily, so, instead, she prepared with most genuine, because forlorn, heroism to die to her dream of young love. Once again Polly had her retirement invaded by"], [58, "Trustworthiness. 44 Amyatt. On this second occasion with a face so troubled and scared that Polly took the first word of alarm, and sprung up crying, \" Has father's knee broken out afresh ?\" \" Oh, no, Miss Polly ; the Captain is a-reading of his newsprint all right ; but will you tell me quick when have you seed them boys ?\" \" Not since breakfast,\" Polly answered promptly ; \" they went away without bothering anybody. But you have given them their dinner \u2014 fried soles\u2014 haven't you, Amyatt ?\" \" I wish they had bothered anybody,\" proclaimed Amyatt, rolling up her apron in a state of extreme perplexity and distress ; \" and I never gave them fried soles nor nothink.\" \"Why, Amyatt, what about that?\" for Polly was inclined to make light of the incident. \" If the boys had been hungry, they would have come home \u2014 ' trust them for that,' mother says. But if they have a penny or two they buy cakes and eat them, sooner than leave their games to run back for dinner, only they risk the flogging with which father is always threatening them.\" \" I should flog the little pickles or kiss them equally, with all my. heart, if I could find them,\" protested Amyatt, desperately. \" Miss Polly, as sure as I'm alive, they have been plotting mischief yesterday, when they were tacking to keep out of the way of the Cap'ain's rage. What do you think little Bill said to me this morning when I caught him and boxed his ears for calling me"], [59, "Trustworthiness. 45 Mother Hubbard, and axing me what my dog had been doing lately, and if he were up to reading the news still ? That were less than civil, but I'd put up with it ; I'd tell 'em any number of stories about my dog if they'd cast up now ; for little Bill he cried when he was going out of the door, ' You'll be sorry for this, Yatt, when you never see my face again. We're off, Ben and me, from a raging Turk of a grand-uncle and the lessons on navigation, since Cousin Polly is grown too fine a lady to look at our forts, and you seek to put us on short commons ' (I had only bidden the two not tuck so hard into the pudding, as I'm a Christian woman, Miss Polly), 'and because auntie is gone, Ben and I are off to sea on our own account' I never dreamt it were aught than a joke, but the lads haven't turned up \u2014 not for three hours after dinner-time. They are but silly little lads ; and Mrs. Creasy she did tell me there were a furrin vessel lying down at Gravesend suspected of crimping boys in order to carry 'em out to furrin parts and sell 'em as slaves or summat like what the old Antelope men brought home. One of Mrs. Creasy's neighbour's sons was lost, it was afeared, and two boys had vanished from Debtford.\" \" It cannot be, Amyatt,\" contradicted Polly, stoutly, though her heart quaked at the mere sound of such mysterious terrors ; \" these are cock and bull stories ; but the boys may have got into a scrape, and I must speak to father instantly.\" \" Laws, no, Miss Polly ! The Cap'ain will frighten us out of our wits, for he will give us all the blame and be as mad as Tom-o'-Bedlam about it. Wait till we see if"], [60, "Trustworthiness. 46 the boys will come in yet \u2014 let me go out and make inquiries. But Polly stood firm. \" No, Amyatt,\" she insisted, though moisture gathered on her forehead and her eye lids flickered in her agitation ; \" if mischief has been done by our letting the poor boys slip, the sooner it is mended by giving my father information the better.\" So Polly went in and confessed all to her father. As soon as Captain Culpepper was able to take in the story, his fury knew no bounds. But he did not take in particulars and inferences at once. He hobbled out, scorning all precautions on account of his knee, and ascertained from the unfortunate lads' companions that Ben and Bill had not been at the usual play-ground or in any of their recognised haunts. He heard that there had really been an American vessel lying a little way down the river, that she had weighed anchor and left her moorings at noon that very day, and that she was suspected of being a privateer and of making attempts to decoy seamen and cabin-boys on board of her for no good purpose. He sounded an alarm, applied to the authorities, employed all the machinery of boats and men which he could command at a moment's notice, and then. feeling his shattered strength giving way, he stumbled back to the house and broke out on the women. He told Polly and Amyatt that they would never see the boys' faces again; that probably the boys were already murdered, sewed into hammocks, and sunk in the river for the sake of the clothes on their backs. He dared the women ever to get the better even of the lads'"], [61, "Trustworthiness. 47 abduction and employment as slaves in the plantations. He said truly that sooner than have lost these fatherless lads committed to his charge, and for whom he was answerable to their wretched mother, he would have consented to be shot like Byng any day. Amyatt, in midst of a storm of sobs and tears, made frantic futile attempts at defending herself and parrying the Captain's deadly blows. But Polly was stricken dumb, till Amyatt, catching a glimpse of the girl's appalled face and poor little hands working with anguish, forgot her own distress and her horror of the Captain, and plucked him sternly by the sleeve, crying, \" Man, do you want to kill your own daughter?\" At that moment Lieutenant Sam, who had been out of Greenwich for the day, walked in to inquire for his old friend's knee, and stood astounded at the fiery atmo sphere into which he had fallen. Captain Culpepper had been a little taken aback by Amyatt's sally, but now he rallied and recommenced a detail of his grievances, not abating one jot of his accusations and reproaches. Lieutenant Sam listened quietly, his cocked hat in one hand held to the ruffled breast of his shirt. He looked from one to another, until he raised his red eye brows and in his turn electrified his old commander by saying : \" Captain Culpepper, pray dismiss your worst apprehensions ; depend upon it they are groundless. A privateer so far up the river indeed ! And if she were, what on earth would she make of two schoolboys ?

I'll have the boys here to breakfast to-morrow morning, Miss Polly \u2014 perhaps to supper to night. So, see you have it ready, Amyatt. And, Miss Polly, I beg and implore you, don't lose your appetite or your sleep, and don't fret. I hate to have a young lady put out by the prank of two urchins \u2014 a trifle which ought not to be enough to disturb the composure of men whose business it is to keep the world in order.\" Lieutenant Sam, who was the least complimentary of men, bowed so low, looked so deferential, and paid such elaborate homage to Polly, by way of freeing her from blame, that Captain Culpepper allowed himself to be walked off with by his younker, like a staggered old sheep, foot sore, and with reeling head. But oh ! the wretchedness of the long evening to the women after the men were gone. If Polly could but have seen the witless young rebels at their forts again \u2014 if she could only have carried bricks for them, and broken her back and bruised her hands to aid them \u2014 if she could only have got another glimpse at their brown monkey faces pulling mouths at her! Instead, they might be hapless prisoners, like Joseph among the Ishmaelites, or they might have slipped from the edge of the quay or stumbled over the gunwale of a boat in the hurry of their flight, and now be tossing breathless and pallid among the piles of the river; or,"], [63, "Trustworthiness. 49 aster having tramped beyond reach, the lads might have lost themselves on the wide, desolate heath, and lain down side by side exhausted and famished, to have their young blood frozen by the keen air of the late spring night. What a mockery seemed the passing recollection of the Cavendishes' party and their \"goings on\" in the Park, with the becks of etiquette, the flouts of coquetry, and the noisy mirth of empty heads and hearts ! How little it appeared to signify now whether such a summer day's acquaintance as Harry Cavendish ever came across her again ! When he could forget her so easily, and replace her at any moment by another, it struck her, at last, that it would be nothing save a pity that he should come across her again, whether in joy or sorrow. Even in her first trouble she could feel forcibly that a Caven dish was no real mate for her. \"Now, Miss Polly, sure you'll write for madam your mother this night. Kind soul ! how she who never had a boy will lament for them nephew's sons,\" pressed Amyatt, breaking off in a wail. Polly caught at the comfort of so much as pouring out the tragedy to her mother ; then she held her forehead and tried to think. \" It will be time enough to-morrow ; we'll have more certain knowledge then. Lieutenant Sam sought to spare me, I'll spare mother to the last, when no good can be got by sending quick word to her.\" Lieutenant Sam was just in time to arrest the boys, secreted in the boat of a doubtful character of a water- E"], [64, "Trustworthiness. 50 man who was pulling in the wake of the American ship. Lieutenant Sam woke up the small depredators from their dreams of being young Raleighs, and of finding new El Dorados. He captured the truants and conveyed them back forthwith to their guardian and grand-uncle. Lieutenant Sam, dry-haired and short tempered as Polly had held him, volunteered a pledge that the escapade should be forgiven and forgotten, and that he would be bail for the offenders with the Captain, and make their peace with their cousin Polly, and with Yatt Hubbard. But when Captain Culpepper and Lieutenant Sam turned up at Formidable House after nightfall, escorting the runagates, that they might at once quiet the hearts of the women, whose minds had been kept so long on the strain, an incident on which neither the lieutenant nor anybody else had counted occurred to bring the lads fully to their senses, and teach them the cruelty of which they had been guilty. Polly fainted dead away at the sight of the party, and the two defaulters raised a united howl of regret or remorse before she was brought back to life again. The time came when Polly and Captain Culpepper went in delight to meet the coach and Mrs. Culpepper on her return. They hugged, and were hugged by the traveller, preparatory to seizing on her wraps and luggage. The last included poultry both live and dead, a little pig squeaking in a bag, a flitch of bacon twice as large as the whole pig, flowers cut and in pots, bags of last year's onions, walnuts and pippins, bunches of herbs,"], [65, "7 rtistworthiness 51 stores of linen and woollen yarn, and a web of cotton cloth. In the midst of telling the mistress and house mother that home would be home again now that its presiding genius and reigning sovereign was restored to her throne, in the unexpected pleasure of hailing jolly Uncle Noll, who had attended his sister on her journey, Polly was only a little struck by a bluish tint in her mother's fresh face, or by a shakiness in the ever-active limbs. Uncle Noll himself called her and her father's attention to these peculiarities. \" All right now,\" prefaced Uncle Noll, to an alarming piece of information ; \" but had the rose in the head pretty smart \u2014 confined her to bed with pains shooting from the brow to the nape of the neck, like a house on fire, for the main part of the first week.

Rose is in our family like gout and apoplexy. The only thing we had a qualm about was that your mother said she might have a summons home ; and she maintained that, should it come, she would rise and obey it, if so be she could lift her head from the pillow ; and she was always a quick-minded, stout-spirited woman, was your mother, when she sought to do a thing \u2014 only this thing might have cost her life.\" \" I thought that you would have been only too glad E 2"], [66, "Trustworthiness. 52 that your mother was come home, Tolly,\" observed Lieutenant Sam, standing by her in one of the long windows, and watching her arranging some of her mother's flowers \u2014 luxuriant blue lupins and crimson peony roses, and sweet white lilies ; not the Lammas lily, as it is called in Scotland, but the May double narcissus, like a white rose, only purer and daintier, and full of a more subtle fragrance. He had half a mind to beg one from her; he thought the lilies so like herself, unapproachable in their delicacy among flowers as she was unapproachable in her delicacy among girls. Polly and Lieutenant Sam had become quite good friends within the last fortnight. She had been so very thankful to hail his rectangular red head and dogged eyebrows on the night when Ben and Bill were lost, that her heart had leapt out in kindness to them ever since. And either Lieutenant Sam began to find fewer occasions to set her right, or Polly began to take kindly to being set right, and thought it at once the pleasantest fun, and very nice and brotherly in Lieu tenant Sam, and that he had a true regard for her beneath it all. \" Why, so I am \u2014 only too glad to have mother home again,\" protested Polly. Then she remembered that she had been surreptitiously brushing the tears from her eyelashes in thinking of her mother's having been ill, when they at home had not had the most distant suspicion of the illness. \" Do you ask because my eyes are wet ?\" Polly made"], [67, "Trustworthiness. 53 an amendment on her statement, smiling ; \" I don't know whether that is for joy or sorrow.\" Lieutenant Sam said nothing more at the time, but he thought that out of his own heart he should know Polly's joy from her sorrow."], [68, "54 II. SINGLE-HEARTEDNESS. \"She will do good and not evil, all the days of her life. /^vNE-FOLDEDNESS the Germans term the quality. It is doubtful if simplicity and sincerity express the full meaning of single-heartedness ; but certainly it is the opposite of craft and expediency, which belong to the false and entirely selfish wisdom of this world. Single-hearted ness is the quality which forbids evil to be done that good may come of it. It enjoins men to take heed that the light which is in them be not darkness. It does good and not evil unto the end, and with regard to every man and woman whom it approaches. Single-heartedness is the truth in the inner man, the straightforward, uncom promising justice and mercy which God asks in His creatures, and of which Christ was the perfect example. Now, it is a fact, and perhaps a fact of greater signifi cance to women than to men, that in the present high state of civilisation the claims of religion, society, and kindred are so complicated and conflicting, as to impose a heavy yoke. It becomes harder and harder to disen tangle these claims, and to grasp each in its own place firmly. When the claims wax finer and thinner it is"], [69, "Single-heartedness. 55 not always easy to distinguish the real from the imaginary \u2014 the promptings of conscience and God's revealed will from the over-persuasion of friends, the sugges tions of pride and vanity, and the temptations to evil always present, either latent or active. The result may be the desperate ravelling of all claims, the dire confusion of the work of life, the throwing up of that web of destiny which God has given us to weave, supplying us with the divine pattern. It is also a grievous truth that the reverse of single heartedness has great sway in the world. Double-dealing, misrepresentation, the withholding of the truth for the purpose of deceiving, is not unfrequently practised under the name of heavenly wisdom, and by the very men and women who profess to follow its guidance. In virulent party spirit and unbridled sectarianism worldly wisdom reigns triumphant. Do you girls and young women shrink from the task of distinguishing the true from the false ? Do you say that the office of censuring and condemning is invidious, and unbecoming your youth, your womanhood ? Do you fall back on your weakness, your inferiority as a sex, your ignorance, or your folly ? God knows, I would have you modest and humble ; and God knows, too, that the task presented to you is hard ; but God himself has set the task, and it is He who requires of you, as of all man kind, to take heed that the light which is in you be not darkness.

Economies, questions of the day, whether public or private, you will also have to decide upon. You must be ready, if necessary, to say to father, brother, husband, son, friend, \"No, I do not think that is right ; I cannot in conscience hold that opinion.\" You are not bound on that account to thwart and disobey father, brother, or husband. On the contrary, you are bound to love and trust, and to obey, when the question is of obedience, as the queen obeys the king. But you are equally bound to be honest, leaving in abeyance the question whether you may or may not be mistaken. You are bound, as an intelligent and immortal creature, to a life-long education ; and you have the highest ends to incite you to lay hold of and store up every fragment of experience and instruction which may reach you at every stage of your history. If you would not be a cipher, such as a manly, independent man ought not to tolerate \u2014 not to say respect \u2014 you must inquire and search into every truth that comes before you.

Single-heartedness in women has herculean labours before it, in dispersing the \" heaps \" of fallacious views, and the wrongs which have been permitted to gather round women's relations.

Even to seek to do right in all these matters, without regard to precedent, is no trifling aim and no unworthy ambition. Think what a benefit it will be to the community when many women will cheerfully brace themselves to earn their own bread, and possibly that of others; when women will not marry save for love and esteem ; when they will study to rule their households, prayerfully work and read, \u2014 the book of nature along with other books, \u2014 look after the poor of all classes, help to bring up the children, shop for what they need, and count only that \" a bargain \" which is fairly worth the money they pay for it, and will not be greedy of other fancied advantages and ill-gotten gains. Simple in any case, \u2014 even in what the French call \" le grand simple,\" \u2014 such lives are beautiful, becoming, and blessedly fruitful. And then think what a curse and scandal it is throughout Christendom that so many pro fessedly Christian women do as nearly as possible the reverse. They say their prayers, and, in place of following the right in all single-heartedness, they dissociate the daily relations of their lives from their prayers ; are influenced by a thousand underhand motives ; show themselves skilful sophists in always \" begging\" the primary principle involved, and in evading so much as the consideration of the law of right which they break, while they are indignantly pointing to the law broken by tbeir neighbours."], [73, "Single-heartedness. 59 I would only say, farther, that single-heartedness in judging what is right, and abiding by the right in buying a riband, or in entering a training hospital, need not imply austerity or intolerance. While a girl judges for herself, she is happily not called upon to judge for her fellow men and women. It she has really tried to see and do what is right, and has found out the blunders and inconsistencies into which, at the best, she will fall, she will either be very young and inexperienced in the world's evils and temptations, or she will be hope lessly narrow-minded and silly if she does not prove candidly and fairly indulgent in the matter of all innocent delight, pitifully gentle in measuring her neighbours' creeds and careers, and in summing-up their shortcomings. JOAN WALTON'S WAYS WHEN FORTUNE TURNED HER WHEEL. Joan Walton came to Greenwich to live with the Misses Tindal. She was an orphan with an income of fifty pounds a year, which was reckoned quite a hand some independence for a young lady, the daughter of a former Vicar of Lewisham. She was not so well supplied in other respects. She had no near relations, though she had been as dear as a daughter to a kind old childless couple, friends of her father's, the master of the Lewisham Free Grammar School and his wife, with whom she had been boarded and brought up. She had taken affec tionate leave of them, and come over to Greenwich to"], [74, "60 Sin 2'lc-Iiea rtedn ess . reside with the Misses Tindal for several good and sufficient reasons, of which the old master and mistress entirely approved. Joan had entered into an engagement with a younger brother of the Misses Tindal, who had since joined his ship in the Mediterranean ; and in those days (about the end of last century) there was not, by any means, such \"calm sailing\" and \"fixed lines\" as there are to-day. It was exceedingly doubtful when Captain Tindal would return to complete his engagement with Joan, seeing that he, along with others, had to watch Spain, France, and Portugal ; had to guard Gibraltar ; and might be drawn out any day to chase a French fleet into the Atlantic, or hang on harassing it, from Cape Cod to Cape Hom, and from Cape Horn round into the Pacific and up to Behring's Straits. And in the meantime Captain Tindal might be wounded or maimed, worn to skin and bone by scurvy, or jaundiced with yellow fever, nay, he might be killed outright ; and Joan's piles of black hair might become ba s of silver while she waited. They were brave and staunch to contemplate such waiting, but there were many brave and staunch young couples married or promised in marriage then, who neither feared nor failed in such serious separations. Doubtless there are many brave and trusting young couples still ; but in our day, when war is not chronic and distance is annihilated, when every adventure is hurried on to its end, long engagements, with their boon and their bane, are comparatively rare. But whether Joan Walton's engagement should come"], [75, "Single-heartedness. 61 to a speedy termination, or be nipped in the bud before it blossomed into marriage, it seemed advisable to all concerned that she should make the intimate acquaintance of the Misses Tindal. Besides, if any pecuniary ad vantage was to be reaped by the family with whom she boarded, that advantage should be the portion of the Misses Tindal, who were only in possession of a small certain income, were partly dependent on their brother, and were alternately buoyed up and sunk down ac cording to the progress of a long-pending suit in Chancery. So Joan went to be a member of the Tindal family. The Misses Tindal occupied a house in the irregular row at the foot of the Park, to the west of the great gates and buildings of the Hospital. They flattered themselves that their house, though one of a row, possessed a little individuality and distinction from the fact that its builder had painted its bricks in red and black diamonds, intersecting each red diamond with a black cross, and each black one with a red. The very oaken door had < ross beams athwart its panels ; and in elegant refer.\".ce to this decorative peculiarity, the Misses Tins'..?/ had named their dwelling \"The Rood.\" In her old home, the King Charles's Grammar School, presented to the parish of Lewisham by the bounty of one of her father's predecessors, Master Colfe, Joan seemed to have a daughter's interest, apart from the circumstance of its being presided over by her old friends, the master and Mrs. May. The shield with its inscription conspicuous on the front of the rambling"], [76, "62 Single-heartedness. structuie, part brick, part wood ; the entrance porch, the dormitories, the broad, small-paned windows, and the trellised passages to the wings of the house and the garden, were all endeared to her by many associations. The great attraction of the Rood to Joan consisted in its being the home of James Tindal's sisters and his own probable home before he could have a nest to himself on shore. She was further reconciled to it by the fact that the windows commanded a glade and alley of the Park, though these belonged to the least sylvan and romantic portions of it which still serve as a nursery and play ground for the poorer children of Greenwich. It was pleasant to her to be able to enter the Park at any time by a side door, pace the terrace by the river, watch the shipping \u2014 especially that which was outward bound, turning her face seaward and fancying that the breeze smacked of brine. Pleasant too it was to chat with some of the old sailors, and get the most bronzed and rugged of them to tell her stories of the galleons which Anson had captured in the Spanish Main, and of the dusky wild men they had seen when they sailed as cabin boys round the world with Wallis and Carteret. Joan in nearly every respect was very unlike the Misses Tindal. She was twenty-two years of age, while Miss Tindal and Miss Lavinia were between thirty and forty. Still Joan was essentially the eldest of the three. She had been early matured and rendered self-dependent. The Misses Tindal, on the contrary, belonged to a set who regarded helplessness and weakness, especially when tombined with sine persons and a few accomplishments,"], [77, "Single-heartedness. 63 as among the chief graces of women. They had been confined to a small, select circle of persons and ideas. They kept a maid and a boy, went to the parish church, rose at a particular hour, were in dishabille and did difficult bits of mending and feats of delicate cooking in the morning ; dressed for the afternoon and visited or received visits ; knotted, and played on the guitar, and again visited and received visits in the evening. In all this, they were persuaded that they did the right and proper thing. They were tall, thin, rather handsome women with high noses and fair though faded complexions. Their morning gowns, or night gowns (in the parlance of the day), were old darned dimity gowns or patched cloth pelisses. Ladies in those days did not scruple to go half their time en papillose, but they wore gauze and lute string in the afternoon and evening, and appeared then in high bows and knots of hair, half their own, half borrowed. The Misses Tindal rather wondered at their brother James's taste in female beauty. In their eyes Joan was a mere dowdy \u2014 a stout, blowsy-faced girl, who exposed her complexion, got tanned, and then made use of none save the simplest washes for the skin. They thought her extravagant and wasteful of her time, because in the morning she wore fresh dimity gowns and cloth pelisses, and combed out and arranged prettily her hair under her little cap. They thought her mean and careless because in the afternoons and evenings she never wore any material better than crape, or adopted any elaborate"], [78, "64 Single-heartedness. fashion for her hair, though she took off her cap. In other eyes Joan was slightly below the middle size, some what squarely although not heavily made, with a fresh, full spirited face, richly yet not coarsely coloured. Certainly the Misses Tindal were willing to have Joan Walton with them, were it only to improve her manners, and teach her, if possible, while there was still time, the proprieties of life. Besides, they had already a liking for her on their brother's account, not altogether unmixed with jealousy, it must be admitted, although they did not acknowledge this even to themselves. It was a great change to Joan to receive the polite strictures and the doubtful approbation of the Misses Tindal, for she had been a pet and a favourite at the Grammar School. But she would say to herself, \" Of course, though they are not like him, James has much regard for his sisters, and I should think little of him if he had not. If the great Dr. Johnson, for the sake of his early friend, could declare that he would love a dog if it were called Hervey, should I not bear a great deal more taking down than I get, and return it by being good natured and obliging to Sophia and Lavinia, for the sake of dear James, who loves us all ?\" Cutting thus to the root of the connection, and ruling her conduct accordingly, Joan had the happiness to discover that the Misses Tindal, like many opinionative individuals, concealed sterling and kindly qualities under a hard coat of conceit and artificiality. They were in the main simple, if silly, well-meaning, affectionate women, not so difficult to lead to what was right if a friend, instead"], [79, "Single-heartedness. 65 of trying to drive them, would make allowance for their prejudices and give sufficient line to their peculiarities. Joan taking the initiative in being amiable, the Misses Tindal were not very slow to follow suit, though they were solicitous not to show it by praising and spoiling her. Indeed they began gradually to consult and lean upon Joan in questions which did not belong to manners. dress, or cooking, as if she were not only a part of James, but James himself. This was pleasant flattery to Joan, but it was not bought without a price being paid for it. The Rood was a dull, often a worrying, home for a girl with energies and gifts beyond the conception of its other inmates. The morning room was dingy and untidy, though there was no man to smoke by its hearth. The evening room was stiff and staring and cold in its grey and blue moreen, and its fragile and paltry ornaments of eggshell work, wafer work, and paper fans. These family rooms formed on many occasions a prison to the young girl, only slightly enlivened by endless discussions on this stuff and that fabric, or on this infallible wash for the complexion by the thrumming of the guitar \u2014 harassing instead Oi soothing \u2014 and by the repeated reading of \"Thomson's Seasons,\" the only book, besides the inspired one, to which Miss Lavinia cared to listen. Society, as the ladies of the Rood saw it, and not as Joan Walton had known it among the liberal-minded and intelligent friends and associates of her earlier years, occupied itself with vapid calls, very weak musical parties, and very strong card parties. Indeed, sometimes the F"], [80, "66 Single-heartedness. strain and struggle were hard upon Joan, but \" soon the worst turns the best to the brave,\" and is not the higher life of earth made up of striving to enter into that kingdom of heaven which the violent take by force ? The Misses Tindal's management of their exchequer, like that of many such ladies, was the mixture of extra vagance and stinginess of which they had accused Joan. They were in the Cavendishes' set in Greenwich, and that set boasted of profuse expenditure and dashing splendour. But the Misses Tindal could only accomplish a show of expenditure by being penurious behind backs. The evil which these Cavendishes did in their generation was great, almost more, it seemed, than if they had been positively and notoriously wicked. They were simply a regardless, luxurious, riotous set. Still there was a certain charm, even to those who were far above them in character, in the Cavendishes' light-heartedness and bonhomie, adorned as these qualities were by the adjuncts of rank and fashion. To men and women, fainting under the burden and heat of the day, there was a fascination in contemplating the easy experience of their neighbours who took matters so lightly \u2014 whose life, so long as they were young and hale, was one long genial holiday. And there arose a tendency to question wistfully whether there was not a mistake somewhere, whether the plodders, the toilers, the painful resisters of wrong and assertors of right did not make too much of their calling, had not grown morbid in it, were not after all beating the air, and spending their poor strength for nought. Even clear sighted Joan was sensible of the spell. The rollicking"], [81, "Single-heartedness. 67 gaiety and good-humour stimulated and enlivened her for the time. Miss Tindal got new fashions and fresh recipes from Lady Maria, and Miss Lavinia acquired a copy of \" My mother bids me bind my hair \" from Miss Betty Cavendish. This song was so charming in its warbling cadences, though given by no better medium than Miss Vine's flat thin voice and jingling instrument, that Joan shook herself up and began guitar-thrumming with some spirit. She said to herself, \"lam not learning a small art merely to please Vine, but I should like \u2014 I should just like \u2014 to sing tolerably 'When Lubin is away' to James Tindal the night after his return.\" In short, the whole household of the Rood was enter tained, and had something to think and speak of after a meeting with the Cavendishes. But on a little trial of the intercourse Joan was compelled sorrowfully to acknowledge to herself that it would not do. \" I must do my best to withdraw and get his sisters to withdraw from it. There is no use putting a false colour upon it \u2014 saying that we should be out of the world if we renounced the Grove, or thinking that we can keep any of these people in order, or that we are under the necessity of securing the Admiral's interest for James Tindal ! I did not know that Vine painted till last night, and she has bought that amber negligee which she could not afford because Alethea Cavendish wondered she did not have one. For my part, I am sorry I went out of the room with that Sir Hugh to play at question and answer \u2014 a forward man who would not take a rebuff though I r 2"], [82, "68 Single-hea rleduess. turned my shoulder to him the whole evening ! I wonder what James Tindal, pacing his quarter-deck under the stars, and lying down in his hammock after saying a prayer for himself and me, would have thought of such foolish doings. Oh ! I am afraid Sophy Tindal first lost and then gained pounds at that senseless Princess Emily's loo, where the players got so engrossed and fierce \u2014 Sophy's eyes glittered so that I was frightened to look at them. That is the sort of racketing which goes on at the Grove \u2014 there are the lust of the eye, the lust of the flesh, and the pride of life with a vengeance.\" The Misses Tindal were exceedingly mortified and offended the first time Joan refused to be present at a supper at the Grove. They were not only amazed but indignant when she had the courage to doubt whether frequenting the Grove could be a permanent advantage to a soberminded, reverent household. They changed their minds a little when, going to the Cavendishes with out her, they were not merely uncomfortable in their con sciences, but fell into worse scrapes. Besides running into debt for dress which it would take twice her next quarter's allowance to discharge, Lavinia got herself spoken of and laughed at, and had to suffer a few real however absurd pangs of wounded vanity and feeling. She had allowed herself to receive marked attentions from an out-at-elbows commander of doubtful reputation, who was found among the rest of the mixed company at the Grove. He had made a blunder in his estimation of the Misses Tindal's income, and discovering this in tiwe, indemnified himself by proceeding bullyingly to ignore"], [83, "Single-heartedness. 69 pool elegant, high-nosed, simpering, guitar-playing Miss Lavinia. Miss Tindal had dipped more deeply into the vice of gambling, which had grown so inveterate that the highest authority in the land could not prevent it, among great and small in his capital and throughout his country. So with a tremble of the lip and a dry throat, turning away her head as she made the request, Miss Tindal had to borrow a large slice of Joan's little savings, which she was patiently accumulating, in order one day, with pride and glee, to show James Tindal what she had gathered for their mutual housekeeping. Joan had no reason to thank the acquaintanceship\u2014 it were scandal to call it friendship \u2014 of the Tindals and the Cavendishes for any lasting gain. She therefore hailed its cessation before it had worked fatal harm. The Misses Tindal would beat down the price of ordinary household purchases in shops, and go in search of inferior goods. They would grudge themselves all additional service, however much it was required, would screw down their expenditure, and diminish their comforts \u2014 even their necessaries, pointing with triumph to a scarcely appreciable saving which was no saving in the end, and which could have been entirely covered by a little self-denial in their pleasures, a little moderation and modesty in those details in which they launched out wildly irrespective of cost. They had no more idea of a wise liberality than of a consistent frugality. Their practice was very much a piece of child's-play to Joan. She did not iiKe to contradict her friends where no"], [84, "Single-heartedness. 70 benefit was to be obtained, and but for the principle involved she would have been a silent witness of the household economy. As it was, when Miss Tindal told Joan how she had bought stale soles and withered asparagus for \"next to nothing,\" and how Miss Lavinia had heard of a half-blind and palsied needle-woman, whose work was dead cheap, Joan could keep silence no longer, but spoke out her mind freely. \" I cannot agree with you, dears \" (for these women were dear to Joan, and she was dear to them, otherwise she could not have had such freedom of speech) ; \"goods and service have their just value, which any observant housewife can fix. Of course, there are fluctuations in trade \u2014 dear and cheap years, war-and-famine or peace-and-plenty prices, but these extraordinary cases generally announce and settle themselves.'' \" You are very provoking, Joan,\" protested Miss Lavinia, affronted and almost hurt ; \" a chit like you to set up for a judge. You never went a-marketing, except with Mrs. May, and everybody knows that she is ridiculously easy.\" \" She has not gone beyond the doctor's income, how ever,\" Joan was provoked to retort in defence of her old friend. \" I daresay not, because she keeps up no style, and gives only humdrum family parties to her own friends,\" said Miss Lavinia, with dignity. \" In ordinary circumstances a purchase is simply worth its value, Vine,\" urged Joan, returning to the main topic, \" and I should not care to give much less or much more"], [85, "Single-heartedness. 71 for it. I should think I was either cheating or being cheated \u2014 probably the latter \u2014 taken in as to quality and quantity, over-reached, and rightly so, in trying, under whatever cunning name and specious pretext, to over reach my neighbour. If I wanted a thing, Sophy, I think it would be cheaper in the end to have it of the best quality, or do without it altogether.\" \" But everybody says we get bargains,\" pled Miss Lavinia plaintively. \" Everybody may be wrong in this case. I, for one, always distrust a bargain,\" said Joan boldly. \" You are talking pedantic, high-flown nonsense, Joan,\" said Miss Tindal dogmatically. \" Nothing can be in worse taste in a woman than pedantry. Your theory does not even sound well, and no sensible woman would practise it.\" \" You are out there, Sophy,\" declared Joan. \" I know one sensible woman who acts out my philosophy, if you will forgive me for using the exalted title. I don't bring forward dear old Mrs. May, as you think her so easy going ; but there is old Mrs. Pettet in the Row here, whom I like to watch. I am sure she is sharp enough, yet I observe when she allows herself a salad and pre pares it with her own hands, the red radishes and green lettuces look as if they had just been pulled in a country garden. She has always the strongest, cleverest char woman in Greenwich to do the work in that little house, though only for an hour every morning. And even when Mrs. Pettet relieves a beggar, it is with such a nice bundle of nourishing scraps and serviceable rags that ii"], [86, "Single-heartedness. 72 seems as if that beggar would never require to beg again.\" \" Mrs. Pettet indeed !\" Miss Lavinia elevated her already elevated nose, \" If it were not one of your odd ways, Joan, I should be surprised that you could waste time in watching an old housekeeper, respectable enough, no doubt, but decidedly one of the people, and a Dissenter to boot. She had better try to make a domestic, indus trious woman of that tom-boy and will-ofthe-wisp of a niece of hers.\" \" Ah, poor old Mrs. Pettet !\" Joan acknowledged frankly, \" I am afraid she has set herself too hard a task there.\" One forenoon Joan was suddenly summoned to the Misses Tindal's morning-room by a shrill scream from Miss Lavinia. She rushed down in her mantle and fur cap, being about to set out for a walk, and found Miss Lavinia lying back in her chair with a scent-bottle held mechanically to her nose, while yards upon yards of lace flounces, which she had been repairing, were lying in dangerous entanglement at her feet. Miss Tindal, who was the stronger-minded sister, was sitting upright with compressed lips and flushed face, grasping an open official-looking letter. Joan stood perfectly still, and asked in a voice which was so unnaturally calm that it sounded dull in her own ears, \" What has happened to James ? Tell me all about it at once.\" \" What should have happened to James ?\" demanded Miss Lavinia passionately ; \" the girl thinks of nobody"], [87, "Single-h ea rtedn ess . 73 but James, as if he were the only person in the world.\" \" It is James's right that I should think of him,\" mur mured Joan, blushing, but standing firm. \" Well, this does affect James,\" granted Miss Lavinia querulously ; \" only he is a man, and has his profession, so that it affects us much more. We have lost the great Tindal lawsuit, Joan ; the horrid Burgoyne-Tindals have got our money and our ancient christening font.\" Thus relieved from her fears about James Tindal, Joan was inclined to say that she was glad to hear what had happened. The misfortune might have been so much more deadly than this decision which brought an inter minable lawsuit to an end, and with it the lagging un certainty and sickness of hope deferred. Joan had been frequently weary of the old story, in spite of James Tindal's supposed interest in it \u2014 for she was aware that from the time when he could reflect he had relinquished all hope of winning the hereditary law suit even should the lawyers leave anything besides the disputed christening font to win. But naturally the Misses Tindal had never tired of discussing the case. An old gentleman, their great grandfather, had married, first executing a marriage con tract which it was doubtful whether he was competent to execute, bequeathing the largest portion of his fortune and a silver christening font to the children of that marriage. The old gentleman's wife died, leaving heirs, and he married again, but without taking the trouble to execute a second marriage settlement. After the old"], [88, "Single-he a rtedu ess. 74 gentleman's death, it became a question whether the bulk of his fortune should be divided among his children according to his inconsistent last will and testament, or whether it should, in accordance with the marriage settle ment, go to the children of his first wife. The question had been bandied about and wrangled over by lawyers during the lives of three generations. The feud had raged hotly between the two branches of the Tindals, but as time passed on, the family hatred had cooled down to a kind of civil dislike, which admitted of the exchange of formal courtesies between the rival claimants. In the last generation an uncle, a younger brother of the Misses Tindal's father, a sailor, had owned some acquaintance ship with a cousin Tindal, also a sailor. Mrs. Burgoyne- Tindal, the widowed representative of the Burgoyne- Tindals until her children grew up, was a woman of far greater means than the Misses Tindal of the Rood, Greenwich, her husband having so far forgotten himself as to make a fortune by trading as a Turkey merchant. When Mrs. Tindal gave her great routs at her villa at Twickenham, she had generally sent cards to the Misses Tindal, of which they had availed themselves, behaving to the donor with remarkable if somewhat stately and freezing suavity. When Joan bestowed a second thought on the decision of the lawsuit, she felt that it was a blow even to her, who had rarely suffered herself to dwell on the windfall that a fraction of money would be to a poor naval officer, working as hard at his profession as the laws of the service would permit, courting toil and danger, and"], [89, "Single-heartedness. 75 allowing himself no rest, that he might the sooner secure an independent position and a provision for those de pendent on him. If the loss was a blow to Joan, how much sorer was it to Sophia and Lavinia Tindal, who had not been able to prevent themselves from building castles in the air with regard to their succession to their great-grandfather's inheritance \u2014 who had promised themselves all manner of good and happy gifts when that day of jubilee and of justice should arrive ! Although the fact had really nothing to do with law and justice, the sentence of the court was rendered harder by being given in favour of the younger and richer descendants \u2014 those to whom it was of less moment, and who could spare it the more easily. As for the font which had got into the dispute by being mentioned in the marriage settlement, the Misses Tindal had been accustomed to speak of it and magnify it into a notable heirloom, till it might have been gold instead of silver, and set round with the crown jewels. At the first blush of the misfortune, the Misses Tindal could see no alleviating circumstances. They could hardly believe that they were literally no worse off in a pecuniary sense than they were before. They spoke of themselves as reduced to beggary, and proposed to leave the Rood that they might hide their diminished heads, while they took in needle-work, and perished in the extremity of indigence. Miss Tindal was very stern and Miss Lavinia very pensive in making these arrangements, winding up with the reflection, \" Our family font, too, which we long"], [90, "76 Single-heartedness. looked forward to having in our hands again, to have passed with the rest of the property to the Burgoyne- Tindals !\" Joan could not listen to this talk. \"Sophy and Vine, we'll care for each other. If we cannot do it otherwise, we'll all keep together,\" said Joan, though her heart sank a little as she gave the pledge. She had looked forward to a home for herself and another, were it only to put in practice those ways of hers which were near to her heart and conscience, and to work them out fairly. Realizing her indebtedness to God, she wished to be enabled to serve Him in those ways. \" But we could never leave poor Sophy and Vine in the lurch,\" Joan told herself. \" We should be under an obligation to pull them along with us. To turn our backs on our nearest relatives, so much weaker than ourselves, would be a poor way of u-icuring happiness !\" exclaimed she, in order to brace herself for the task which might be before her ; and then she made a diversion by announcing demurely, \" If ever there are babies in the family again, it is to be hoped that they may become Christians even without a hereditary silver font.\" The Misses Tindal went into a low state of spirits after their final disappointment in the loss of the lawsuit. Any visits which they received were visits of intimate friends, and were understood to be visits of condolence, almost as much as if they had been paid after the death of a relative. It was therefore a surprise when Admiral Medhurst called one afternoon in full uniform, on his way to dine with the governor of the hospital, and hailed them all as"], [91, "Single-heartedness. 77 hilariously as it he came to wish them joy on their acces sion to an inheritance. \" I cannot stay a minute, my dear ladies, 'pon my honour I cannot ; one must go aft when one has been piped for, if he would not miss his rations at the governor's. But I said the moment I got the letter, I should launch the gig, \u2014 that is, step in myself to bid you pull off your mourning and come out of the dismals, and say how glad I am to do it. The lump of prize money due to your late Uncle Thomas for his share in the taking of the San Jago, about which there was a hitch at the Admiralty, and which has been accumulating all these years, has now fallen to you. You may thank your stars, my dear ladies, for otherwise it might not have come to your lot, since your Uncle Thomas lived like a lord on shore. Now it is a very pretty sum, I should say worth any dirty loss from a lawsuit. There are the papers which you must look over and sign ; you'll find them all right. Good-day to you.\" This great and wonderful reversal of fortune came so suddenly on the Misses Tindal that they had not time to ejaculate more than, \" Uncle Thomas ! Prize money ! You do not say so, Admiral !\" It seemed like a miracle, a special interposition of Providence on the Miss Tindals' behalf. Much as they had thought of the Tindal lawsuit and the glory of winning it, they had not had more than the faintest iJea of any prize money belonging to their bachelor and somewhat spendthrift Uncle Thomas, which had not been paid to him. In their excitement and exultation, they said it was a case"], [92, "78 Single-hea r ted ness. of beautiful compensation. Joan Walton had not much faith in material compensation, but she agreed that the succession was opportune. She was very grateful for it, too, and hoped that it would not turn all their heads. She read the papers with the Misses Tindal, and every thing seemed correct. The two thousand pounds to which the original sum had grown was a most tangible and substantial gain. The half of it would have been sufficient to render them independent of their brother, and to warrant him, with what he and Joan possessed, in returning on the first opportunity and marrying more speedily than anybody had dared to hope. The three ladies were flushed with happiness, and the news drifted somehow to the kitchen, where it was eagerly taken up by the cook and the boy. Miss Tindal searched in her late father's desk for some letters of her uncle's, which she intrusted to Joan Walton to read. Joan read to herself the two or three yellowing letters, with their sprawling, fading characters and foreign post marks. Her brow puckered in the reading, her hand clenched nervously, and her foot began to beat the carpet. \" What does Uncle Thomas say for himself?\" de manded Miss Vine vivaciously. \" Fine old man ! I always held his memory in the greatest esteem. Not to interrupt you, Joan, don't you think I should buy that puce tabinet to-morrow ?\" \" I'd leifer it were a velvet \u2014 a Genoa,\" whispered Miss Tindal, with an importance which became mysterious and solemn. \" We can at last afford such pelisses as I always hoped to wear one day.\""], [93, "Single-heartedness. 79 \" I'll have a chair of my own to go out in,\" continued Vine, drawing herself up and spreading out her hands. \"And I'll have old Tim Betts for one of my caddies. Tim used to carry James on his back when my brother was a boy. That will please you, Joan.\" Joan's hand was clenched tighter, her foot beat faster. \" But, oh, my darlings !\" she said in quite a tragic tone, for she, too, had been wrought up to a pitch of expecta tion and triumph, \" I cannot find that Uncle Thomas was in the Nestor which captured the San Jago. On the contrary, I find from what he writes here that his cousin, Thomas Tindal \u2014 those Tindals were not called Burgoyne- Tindal till this generation \u2014 must have been an officer in the Nestor at the very time when the ship encountered the San Jago off the island of Trinidad.\" \" What do you mean, Joan ?\" stammered Lavinia, really confounded and unable to grasp the terrible conclusion. \" Hold your tongue, Joan !\" Miss Tindal commanded violently. When Miss Lavinia comprehended the true state of the matter, she commenced to argue and insist that it was their Uncle Thomas who had been in the Nestor, Admiral Medhurst had told them so. There had been nothing said about the other Thomas Tindal. Why should they search him out to ascertain whether he had any connection with the affair ? \" I am sure I have heard that Uncle Thomas was at tne taking of the San Jago,\" Miss Tindal said with decision."], [94, "80 Single-heartedness. \" It may be true, Sophy,\" Joan admitted sorrowfully, \" so he may have been, but that is only an impression of yours, and here is positive information. It is too probable that the impression owes its existence to the fact of your Uncle Thomas's cousin having been on board the Nestor. That fact might have been mentioned to you, and you, as well as other people, may have confounded the cousins from the similarity of theii names.\" \" You are a cruel, cruel girl !\" cried Miss Lavinia, \" you must like to torture us, or you would not put such abominable fancies into our heads, just when we were so happy. I see your drift, you want everything to go to Mrs. Burgoyne-Tindal, to swell her great prosperity. You must be mad, Joan, and \u2014 and \u2014 profane, and horribly unjust !\" A modest tap came to the parlour-door and broke in on the troubled discussion. It was the boy, who had been prompted by the cook, to ask if they were to have a small sum to get a pitcher of cyder Or elder-flower wine with which to drink Captain James's health, and a happy home-coming and wedding to him and Miss Walton ; also to inquire if he should run down to St. Alphege's and summon the ringers to let them have a peal of the bells. \" Not the bells at present,\" answered Miss Tindal, shaking herself up and taking from her pocket a small silver coin, \" but there is sixpence, that you and Molly may rejoice with us and do the house credit.\" Miss Tindal looked loan full in the face, put forth her"], [95, "Single-heartedness. 81 hand and clutched the Admiralty papers. \" I shall have them signed to-morrow and forwarded at once to Somerset House.\" When the boy had left the room, \" Sisters,\" said Joan, still unconsciously dramatic, \" though the Burgoyne- Tindals should never hear of this prize-money or put in a claim for it, though James were to let you take it with out investigation, could you ever spend it while there remained a suspicion that it was not yours ?\" \"Why not consult dear Mr. Wray?\" suggested Miss Lavinia ; by a bright idea selecting the most notoriously time-serving clergyman in Greenwich, as judge. \" Why consult Mr. Wray ? There is no need for con sultation. The moral law and the Lord's rule, to do unto others as we would have them do unto us, is as plain as day,\" pronounced Joan a little indignantly, for she was a quick-tempered girl, and her heart was hot within her. \" We'll consult nobody,\" said Miss Tindal. \" The papers were sent to Admiral Medhurst for us, as the representatives of Uncle Thomas, and I remember hear ing that he was in the Nestor when the San Jago struck sail.\" Joan crept up to bed that night more miserable than she had been since she came to the Rood. She envied the honest wives of the honest watermen, the women and the men who knew of no tampering with truth on the part of their near and dear relatives. She cried herself to sleep, but had not slept two hours when she was awakened by Miss Tindal standing in her nightdress like a a"], [96, "82 Single-heartedness. ghost, and saying, in a harsh, abrupt voice, as she thrust the Admiralty papers into her hand, \" There ! take them and forward them to the other people, Joan. I dare not trust myself to keep them till morning. If we have lost everything else, at least let us save our honour.\" \" We'll save a great deal more, dear Sophy,\" declared Joan, understanding the situation in a moment, jumping out of bed, and clasping her sister in her arms \u2014 \"we'll secure the sentence to be spoken one day to ravished ears : ' Well done, good and faithful servant !' \" The false announcement with regard to the late Thomas Tindal's prize-money remained unknown in Greenwich, except to a few persons who had heard the rumours scattered abroad like gossamers by the cook and the boy. Having been traced to no reliable source, however, these rumours were dispersed like vapour. Admiral Medhurst had happened to go from home after his visit to the Misses Tindal; and if he had felicitated himself on his mission at the governor's table, the talk had not come to light. This was a comfort to the poor Misses Tindal, as well as to Joan, for they had got enough of public condolence on the loss of their lawsuit. But the fact was, the Misses Tindal were not nearly so dispirited by the second bitter disappointment as bv the first. They dressed themselves in the afternoon as usual, and sat in reasonable resignation, not without a certain sense of honest complacency, derived from the secret incident of their having maintained a clear conscience in the matter of the prize-money."], [97, "Single-heartedness. 83 But one afternoon, when a grand coach drove up to the Rood door, the Misses Tindal's late equanimity received a shock. No wonder ! There alighted a magnificent lady, in the finest of cloth and broadest of gold lace, and with a plume of feathers standing up at least a foot and a half above the crown of her hat. As she descended the steps of her coach and ascended the steps of the house, she leant on the obsequious arms of two powdered foot men, who proclaimed to the Misses Tindal's astonished boy \u2014 what the unhappy ladies within already knew tco well \u2014 that this was Mrs. Burgoyne-Tindal. She had taken the liberty to ride down and see them on the subject of the communication which they had been so good as to send her. Miss Lavinia burst into tears, and even Miss Tindai manifestly shook at the thought of facing their all conquering rival. \"She need not have come here to glory over us,\" sobbed Miss Lavinia. \"I'll go in and see her, if you like, Sophy?\" volunteered Joan, full of pity. \" Of course you'll go in, Joan, as one of the family,\" responded Miss Tindal, tartly ; \" but more than you must go in for the hospitality of the house. Put my scarf right. I'll get the seeing of the woman over.\" It was a hard ordeal ; but after the first moment Miss Tindal seemed to rise to the occasion so gallantly, that Joan was completely taken aback. Going to the drawing room half an hour later, she found her sitting on the grey and-blue settee crying as badly as Miss Lavinia. Mrs. G"], [98, "84 Single-heartedness. Burgoyne-Tindal, with her fine plumes all in a flutter, was striving to calm her hostess. She was bathing Miss Tindal's forehead with a cambric handkerchief dipped in eau-de-luce, which the great lady had poured wastefully into what seemed to Joan's bewildered eyes an old battered pewter basin, that was suffered, on the emer gency, to desecrate the Misses Tindal's inlaid card table. \"My poor dear ! the succession of trials has been too much for you,\" cried Joan, rushing to the rescue. \" I am sure I did it for the best,\" declared the snubbed guest, defending herself to J oan. \"I thought to confer a pleasure by riding down to Greenwich and telling you what I had discovered. I got the Admiralty documents which the Misses Tindal forwarded to me, and I ransacked my papers and learnt beyond mistake that both of the Thomas Tindals were on board the Nestor when the San Jago was taken. These officers were on friendly terms, and had been occasionally shipmates ; not having been such geese \u2014 excuse me, Miss Walton \u2014 as the other members of the two families. The same name had caused one of the men to be lost sight of in a hasty copy of the list of the Nestor's officers ; but the mistake is now remedied.

Sitting up and waving her hand, she said \u2014 \" I beg a thousand pardons, Mrs. Burgoyne-Tindal, for being so foolishly overcome.

INDUSTRY. \" She .... worketh willingly.\" T N some parts of Germany there are government schools, with departments for girls of the middle classes. It is there required that each girl, according to her years and the form on which she sits, shall execute, under a qualified mistress, a certain amount of knitting and sewing. A girl of eleven years on the second form, in addition to her attainments in literature, science, and music, must have knitted from top to toe, by her own skill, one or more pairs of stockings, and stitched in the same manner one or more shirts. And it should be noted that in some of these higher German schools the course of study begins early, and is thorough. The girl's ostensible education concludes with her confirmation ; and this epoch is marked in the calendar of needlework by her embroidering an elaborate confirmation hand kerchief. This is the work of many months, and it is preserved and shown as a kind of certificate of honour for the rest of the worker's life. The handkerchief is more an article of show than of use.

Physiolo gists, indeed, have written largely against imposing seden tary and highly artificial occupations upon girls and young women because such occupations crook the spine, con tract the chest, and generally debilitate the nervous system. There is no doubt that the industry of the hand has given place largely to the industry of the head, and to the mechanical contrivances of the head, among women as well as men. The sewing-machine prevails, like the spinning-jenny and the power-loom ; whilst the strictures of the physiologists have received attention and done good service. And yet the physiologists have not ex hausted the subject, since these strictures seem as much called for as ever when in the present day the fashionable amusement of lacet-work is dimming the sight, bending the shoulders, and injuring the lungs of as many victims as were ever slain by the instrumentality of carpet needles and Berlin wool, or by the doing of earlier satin pieces. Certainly it is the abuse and not the use of such pur suits which cried, and still cries, for the denunciations of men of medicine and of men of sense of every profession. Without such pursuits, what is to become of those habits of disciplined patience and close attention which rendered our grandmothers, for most part, busy, happy, and healthy young women, and if no longer busy, then contented and"], [102, "88 Industry. hale old women, in spite of the unhealthiness of their business ? Crooked spines and contracted chests are bad things, but crooked tempers and crooked practices with contracted powers of observation are hardly better things. Physiologists and philosophers, whether Christian or rationalistic, many of them devoted friends to women, claim for their sisters a wider education, a higher career, and point to the great fields of knowledge and ambition, only bounded by their lawfulness. These men tell women, with reason, that they will want all their old disciplined patience, close attention, and unflinching labour, before they can be fit to practise as doctors, or to have a voice in the election of national legislators ; before they can be classical scholars like Mrs. Montagu, astronomers like Mary Somerville, botanists like Eliza beth Loudon, artists like Rosa Bonheur. Let this be fully granted. Every honest man and woman must admit that this is a transition period in women's history. Every lover of his kind must perforce ponder on the multitude of struggling working women, in Great Britain alone, for whom there is not sufficient work, and for whom, therefore, there is not bread. Every brave magnanimous soul, while it eschews the clamour raised by foolish women, must also eschew the evil railing at earnest women, and the flippant mockery of them. For what is the resource left to those who are not permitted to work ? That they should hang like millstones, not sing'y but in knots, round the necks of unfortunate and slenderly furnished male relatives, whom the still more unfortunate daughters and sisters must"], [103, "Industry. 89 eventually strangle, unless some of them are driven to sell themselves in marriages without love or esteem, being taunted at the same time with the meanness and vileness of the sale. All this happens because short-sighted custom and narrow-minded prejudice forbid women from training, perfecting, and employing well their God given endowments for the good of themselves and their neighbours. What are the arguments for the cowardly injustice ? Ah! womanliness might suffer! As if womanliness has not suffered horribly already from enforced idleness, mercenary marriages, and warped and misdirected facul ties. Again, woman's brother man, hampered as he is already with his fellow competitors, might find himself still more hampered, and be called upon to fight a fierce battle with his own incompetency, laziness, and self indulgence, or might be compelled to develop fresh re sources in order to reach the goal on any of the crowded race-grounds of life. In the name of all that is manly and womanly, we shall trust that womanliness may yet have a trial on more open, nay, let it even be more exposed ground, in order that the world may see whether it is of such a feeble, sickly, Turkish description that a little experience of the outer world of schools and professions, a little competition and rivalry, must stamp out its modesty, and wither its grace. Or do men actually believe that women have been quite innocent of competition and rivalry till the nineteenth century ? In like manner we shall hope that manliness may soon get the chance of proving"], [104, "Industry. 90 that it is made of gallanter and stouter stuff than to require favour, and a limited list of competitors, in order to insure its triumph. But after all that can be said on this vexed \" woman's question,\" it is still a question not a solution. The solu tion of the problem belongs to the next generation \u2014 to you girls and women rather than to the present genera tion \u2014 to your children, nieces, and baby-sisters rather than to yourselves. If you are growing or grown-up girls in quiet, established homes, in town or country, you are about as much beyond a new direction of your whole life as a grown-up man is in ordinary cases beyond the ac quirement of a profession ; only some violent pressure of circumstances could alter your destination ; you must make the most of what duties and privileges are yours. And you are blessed with many honourable duties and privileges. I do not hesitate to say that you have the first and most essential duties and privileges, although I decline to admit that the duties and privileges which were sufficient for your grandmother are therefore sufficient for you ; or that, with changes everywhere, there should be stagnation here. But whether you are destined to be a strictly domestic woman, or a yet more large-hearted and public-spirited woman (and all the really great have been notable for the fulfilment of the humblest vocations, nor were they, on account of their greatness, less devoted rulers and servants in the kingdom proper of home), there is one rule which you must lay down for yourselves : you must cling to the conviction that industry is moral and mental, yea, even"], [105, "Industry. 91 physical life, and that idleness is death. Think of all the great and good workers in history. Think reverently of the Divine Worker. Think, and shut yourselves out from idleness as from a state of paralysis and of growing corruption and decay. There cannot be two opinions on this antagonism ; there may be on the tendencies and the sphere of women, but with the honest and good, however wise, however simple, there is no room for division here. Industry of any kind \u2014 including in a measure even mistaken and wasted industry \u2014 is hopeful and invigorating. Vacuity and sloth in their grossest form, or in the more enticing and deluding forms of trifling and flightiness, are in themselves simply hopeless, utterly annihilating all true power and profit. Do not mistake me in supposing that by industry I mean violent exertion, feverish excitement, or spasmodic effort. These conditions of mind and body are by their nature exhausting. They can be stimulated and con tinued only for a short time, and are followed by the cor responding reaction of languor, depression, and disgust. Neither do I dream for a moment of writing against free and, if possible, joyous relaxation, both of body and mind. These are necessary for all \u2014 especially neces sary for the young. My version of industry is made up of earnest purpose ; steady application for regular periods of time ; conscientious resistance of disturbing elements ; and the practice of self-denial with regard to tempting pleasures when these intrude on working hours. Will such habits make prigs and martinets of you girls ? That undesirable result need not follow of couise. On"], [106, "Industry. 92 the contrary, the more obstacles you encounter and over come, the harder you find it to be industrious workers, the more self-distrustful, unassuming, and patient you ought to prove. I know, of old, how girls are apt to dislike Drudgery. I, for one, have learnt to love her plain face, not without its simple grandeur because of its mingled meekness and power. I wish you would learn to love her face too. Believe me she will serve you well in the end, far better than many a fairer-seeming friend. With her helping you, under God, you may do most things. I honestly believe that even in those exceptional pursuits which are supposed to depend largely on special inspiration, there is something, yea, a great deal, in that definition of genius which attributes it confidently to \" him who can sit longest.\" Certainly, without severe painful thought and patient labour no great work of art was ever yet executed. Once grant the supremacy of worthy industry, and I confess that I do not care so very much about its object. Undoubtedly lacet-work is neither so influential nor so beneficial as cooking dinners for hungry men and women, or, shall we say, accomplishing what it is the constant reproach cast on women in the present day that they have not accomplished \u2014 the writing of immortal epics, the composing of an immortal opera, or the painting of a \"Last Supper.\" Lacet-work in its measure may be good, may give pleasure and cultivate taste. And it is the principle above all for which I am contending. I leave its application for future consideration, only arguing that no occupation"], [107, "Industry. 93 is beneath the practice of this virtue, as no study is above industry or independent of it. Whatever is worth doing, is worth doing well. George Herbert's lines have been often quoted, but not too often : \u2014 \"A servant with this clause Makes meanest work divine ; Who sweeps a room as by God's laws Makes that and the action fine.\" The tiniest bit of stitching may be done alike to the creature and the Creator's praise. A host of obligations, circumstances, talents, and incli nations must control the direction of your industry. It is right they should do so. The one fixed unalterable point is that you be industrious ; that you do something, and see that what you do is within its own fit bounds. Deputy housekeeping, teaching younger brothers and sisters and working for them; training for a profession, or for volunteer nursing of the sick and guiding of the helpless ; mastering the laws of harmony in music or of perspective in drawing; winning the power of translating the classics or of solving geometrical problems ; speaking modern French and German, or compassing a few inches of embroidery for your own innocent gratification and that of your friends \u2014 whatever you do let it be done always in its season, and with all your might. If possible, while you are still so far young and un formed, strive to form for yourselves habits of settled dili gence and constant, conscientious employment. Don't slander routine, although it is the fashion to make all"], [108, "Industry. 94 manner of attacks on red-tapism. The abuse of routine may extinguish enthusiasm, and leave no opening for invention ; but its use is like the employment of organisa tion among bodies of men. Correct classification, dis tribution, discipline, and engagement in one combined force, which is cemented by obedience and quickened by knowledge of duty \u2014 these are the qualities which make the difference between an army and a mob. It has been sometimes urged as a plea for teaching Latin to all boys who make an approach to a liberal edu cation, whether they are to be engaged in trade or in professions, that Latin grammar so draws out the intellect and inures it to bearing its burden, and so improves the memory, that a boy is an abler boy and likely to become an abler man from being impelled, flogged it may be, through the Latin grammar, even although that should be the beginning and the end of his Latin. This notion does not vitiate the conclusion that he will be an abler man still if he learns Latin and does not relinquish it, but carries it on into the business and relaxation of his life, and thus escapes a sense of aimlessness both in actual ex perience and on retrospection : just as walking for one's health is attempting a wide range in which one is not nearly so likely to attain the mark, as in walking for some more patent object, and securing health to boot. If die Latin grammar is a shibboleth and an open sesame for boys, what is there for girls, who do not often learn Latin grammar unless to accompany and spur on their brothers ? I have heard it said that the impressing upon a littie"], [109, "Industry. 95 girl's uncalculating mind the notes in the musical gamut, their names, situations, and relative value, has much the same effect, and is an ample reason for teach ing all little girls music, whether or not they have the sense of tune and a musical taste. I fear, however, that the statements in behalf of the Latin grammar and the musical gamut have alike an interested ring. Anyhow, some ordeal is needed to make boys and girls, men and women, patient and indefatigable, and the sooner such an ordeal is enforced judiciously the better. I wonder if any girl scouts at industry as commonplace and unin teresting while she grasps at some vain shadow of sudden and glorious deed ? I cannot do much to help her ; I can only warn her as being more deserving of warning than the frivolous, small-hearted girl who does not even dream of greatness, but is full of her own petty egotism, her desire to shine and create a sensation. I can only repeat to the girl who is more womanly in her aspirations, that if she would live to earn laurels which will be green when her locks are grey, if she would with God's blessing secure contentment and satisfaction as well as a hope which cannot be taken away from her, let her see that \" she worketh \" and \" worketh willingly.\" Let every day have at least an hour or two of regular and earnest occupation \u2014 something far removed from the desultory, rambling, scrambling correspondence which forms at present the chief pretence at serious occupation with one class of young ladies. The real occupation may leave a girl a little fagged and wearied, but there is a healthful weariness which is soon repaired, and which, in"], [110, "96 Industry. place of working harm, does a world of good. Never was an innocent amusement less glad because it was taken after a spell of work. The laugh of the girl or the young woman who chooses work as her best in heritance, may not be so loud and light as the laugh of the idle, merely pleasure-seeking girl, but it will be an infinitely heartier, because richer, and mellower laugh, from a nature at once higher and deeper, purer and fuller. It would seem as if when the curse of sin fell on man and woman they were bidden to work not only as a punishment, but as a relief from their misery, and as a safeguard for the dim dawn of that redemption which shall brighten and broaden to perfect day. If any man or woman declines the commission, one element essential to health of body and mind perishes. Retribution is not slow to follow, nor is it difficult to trace. The \" sick ening of a vague disease,\" the deficient health and morbid frames alike of body and mind in women who ought to be in their bloom and vigour, the craving for excitement and the sinking into the lower craving for stimulant, the restlessness and perversity, and the abandonment to passion \u2014 have all their rise in the evil side of human nature and its chief handmaiden idleness. If there is any foundation for the clever portraiture ot downright levity, want of any high ideal, of all true gentleness and nobleness, which prevails in the works of many popular authors ; if there is one grain of truth in the shameful strictures on \" the girl of the period \" \u2014 a great source of blame lies in the mingled idleness and self-indulgence of so many women's lives. The"], [111, "Industry. 97 girl who prays and fights to become a good and brave woman, a blessing to herself and to her whole kindred and friends, must do her best to avoid deterioration and degradation. She must turn her back on idleness, and on what is no better than a specious form of idleness, the spending her entire time in the social trifling of morning calls and evening parties, in displaying her person, or her accomplishments, or \u2014 a rarer com modity still \u2014 her mother wit. JENNY'S LESSON. \" I tell you, Jenny, you shall do it within the year, else you and your brother Rowley shall pack and return where you came from. I will take your cousin Nan, and her little brother Nat, in the place of you two incapables \u2014 there ! the blessed apostles never spoke truer gospel. If you like to destroy Rowley's prospects as well as your own \u2014 destroy them.\" The speaker was \" old Mrs. Pettet ;\" and she was not so very old, though she was old to Joan Walton, who was fond of watching her from the coign of vantage offered by the Rood. The listener was Mrs. Pettet's incorrigible young niece Jenny; and the task was the working in fine silk, from a minute and dingy pattern, an amount of canvas that might serve for a set of screens and rugs. \" We all did it, my mother and aunts, my sisters and myself, all save your poor mother,\" Mrs. Pettet went on ; \" my grandmother was own servant to my lady at the Hall, and got the pattern after the young ladies had sewed it, H"], [112, "98 Industry. and they had it from surrin parts. We had only a year to do it in, and we had many more house duties than you, what with taking a lively interest in the meeting and in all the worshippers, including the poor. Yet we did it there it is.\" Mrs. Pettet's tone was very much as if she said, \" and see what women it made of us.\" As she spoke she nodded her huge cap with its yellow ribands, took snuff, and shook the sleeve of her chintz gown free from any particle of the powder, all the while looking her recusant niece through and through with her clear, round dark eyes. Jenny, on the other hand, had those long eyes which are apt either to languish in laziness or to dart saucy mischief out of their extreme corners. Mrs. Pettet had been the daughter of a Methodist shopkeeper, half a lifetime earlier. She had married and been left a childless widow while still young. She had gone out as a housekeeper, saved money, and had retired from service and drifted to Greenwich. Joan Walton was right when she said that no woman in Green wich lived with more independence and comfort on her small means than did Mrs. Pettet. Neither was she altogether selfish in the disposal of her effects ; she had sent and fetched from the country the half-grown daughter and the little son of a dead sister. The young people's father had married again, and the stepmother, with a family of her own, was hard to her stepchildren. And not without provocation, as Mrs. Pettet candidly idmitted, after she had become better acquainted with"], [113, "Industry. 99 Jenny. Still the young people were so far Mrs. Pettet's own flesh and blood, and she was willing to give them a trial \u2014 to make a man and a woman of them \u2014 imbue them with sound principles ; for Mrs. Pettet was firm in the puritan morality as in the puritan theology. But she was equally determined not to waste her protection and patronage on ungrateful and impracticable young persons, who would not respond to her efforts for their good, or do either her or themselves credit. If Jenny and little Rowley were not likely to turn out as Mrs. Pettet had a right to expect of them, she had given intimation before hand that she would send them back to Dorsetshire, and transfer her care to the children of another sister \u2014 only she was alive and able to mind her own. Mrs. Pettet would much prefer to benefit the girl and boy of the dead, who had nobody else to do for them, if they would only let her. The pair arrived \u2014 Jenny, a girl of fourteen, in a frock and little tippet, with long mittens, and a round eared white muslin cap instead of a bonnet, and Rowley, a child of nine, in the little coat and knee-breeches of a little old man. No sooner had they come than Mrs. Pettet put the boy to the Grey-coat School, that he might learn to read, write, and cipher, acquirements useful to gardener, hairdresser, or cook, and took the girl into her own hands. The charge of Jenny was no sinecure. Mrs. Pettet might have done better to send her to school also. But few decorous, disciplined schools (and it was only these that Mrs. Pettet would have selected) could have en- H 2"], [114, "Industry. 100 dured the infliction without remonstrance. Then Mrs. Pettet was a quick-tempered, bigoted dissenter, and though she contrived to live at peace with her neigh bours, natives of Kent and church people for the most part, worse might have come of their continual reflections on Jenny. Jenny was not a bad girl, but she was a creature with quicksilver in her veins. She was full of impulse, volatile, and, even in her fits of indolence, fickle to a degree. She had hung very much as she had grown in her father's house, managing systematically to shirk the authority of her stepmother, and to pursue her own gratification. She was regarded by her stepmother merely in the light of a plague, who must be pulled up one of these days, otherwise she would come to grief and prove a disgrace to the family. The change from this systemless neglect to Mrs. Pettet's active-minded surveillance was great and trying. Yet there was something good in the child, which Mrs. Pettet did not fail to appreciate, though the evil is her resisted her aunt's ardent, energetic measures. Jenny set them at nought, and was in perennial disfavour ; but she had no wish to return with Rowley to her old home, where her father was little at home and her unattached, self-engrossed stepmother paid little heed to her, except to predict her final disgrace. Mrs. Pettet's threat of packing the young people off was alarming to Jenny. She had not minded it much at first, because she had not believed her aunt would carry it out, seeing, as Jenny was quick to do, how much she"], [115, "Industry. 101 thought about her and her brother. But when Jennv learnt that her aunt did not waste words more than other things, and that she was as sparing of scoldings as of pettings and terms of endearment, the threat began to bulk solidly and acquire somewhat awful proportions, even to Jenny's mercurial temperament. Mrs. Pettet had brought out that bale of canvas and those chamois cases of silk, and proposed their union in a fabric of embroidery so soon as Jenny had arrived. The fact was, Mrs. Pettet had provided the materials and had the lesson ready set for Jenny \" against \" her coming. But perceiving, as the autocratic old woman still per mitted herself to do, the exceeding disinclination of the girl to the arduous undertaking, she had waived it for a time, and substituted this or that trifle for it. She had put Jenny to the making down of old chintz gowns and linen aprons into frocks for her and smocks for Rowley, and to the coarse netting of curtains and chair-covers, with which to beautify their rooms. But the result was unsatisfactory. When a girl would not sit still for five minutes, when she would have different work for every hour of the day, when she was constant to nothing but her chatter, and her clatter out and in on her pattens, what could she grow up but a giddy, good-for-nothing woman, whom Mrs. Pettet would not own or maintain, to the loss of her substance and credit, and the ruin of her peace ? No, the pomegranates and Parmesan violets would cure Jenny, or nothing would. Mrs. Pettet was a Michaelmas goose to have let Jenny off from the crown ing test and finishing stroke put lo her aunts' and grand-"], [116, "Industry. 102 aunts' education. Perhaps had Jenny's poor mother sewed through the ten pomegranates and twenty-two bunches of Parmesan violets, she might have acquired firmness and fortitude, and not given way and died, but continued in the body to rule and guide her daughter. Though Jenny was dressed like an old-fashioned woman, she was not a womanly girl of fourteen. Margaret Copeland, who was the soul and stay of her mother's little house down near the pier, was neither older nor bigger than Jenny. But Margaret, when she was in one of her flights of fancy, adventure, or con quest, looked already like a young sibyl, or such a nymph Egeria as met and instructed the old Roman king. Jenny at this stage presented a curious contra diction. She was slight and puny, but not purely youthful looking. She was thin and sharp, but not exactly old-looking for her years. She bore most like ness to a meddling, dabbling monkey. Still, she was a pretty girl, with lustrous eyes, a trace of carmine in her dark cheek, and something lurking about the corners of her mobile mouth which was artless and confiding, in spite of her folly and greater knowledge of the idle scampish world of two provincial towns than was good for her. Jenny Pettet was a far prettier girl in reference to features and complexion than Margaret Copeland ; but even then Margaret's individuality looked some thing much higher and more precious, a spring of bounty and of security, while Jenny's individuality was a care and worry, a foreboding of mischance \u2014 almost of disaster."], [117, "Industry. 103 The house which Mrs. Pettet occupied was a very peculiar one. It was merely a wooden turret large enough to contain three small rooms, reared on the roof of another house, through which, in the convenience of its common stair, Mrs. Pettet had to descend in order to reach the lower and outer world. These whitewashed turrets were not unusual in Greenwich ; but generally they were only excrescences and additions to houses. Mrs. Pettet's turret was a separate dwelling, and had not merely windows, but a door \u2014 the half of it of glass, which, although it did not lead to the nether earth, opened on a little balcony, that commanded an extensive view. Here Mrs. Pettet spent a good deal of her time in fine weather, and did a considerable portion of her cooking and cleaning, so far as the last had to do with the rinsing and the drying of dels plates and old Nankin cups and saucers. Here she always wound up her cleanings by scrubbing the balcony itself, and by trimming and training its hop, which bore a wealth of leaves, though not more than a meagre apology for berries. These, with a pot or two of scarlet beans, were Mrs. Pettet's attempts at a garden. The old woman would sit in her chair in the balcony among the lavish hop-leaves and gay scarlet bean flowers, and look down on the roofs of houses, as Joan Walton at the Rood looked over on Mrs. Pettet's doings. At the one side Mrs. Pettet could gaze on the Park \u2014 green and undu lating, with its Hospital domes and cupolas ; and at the other away on a bay-like bend of the river, lying in silver or lilac or blue-black light, with a white or brown boat 01"], [118, "Industry. 104 bark gliding across the space between the nearly meeting sheaths of grey masts and tall red houses. And Deborah Pettet, gaunt and strong-featured, sitting, like another Deborah, under a hop for a palm tree, made a picture in herself. Who knows but it might have been as easy to judge Israel in its days of primitive unrest and turbulence as to tame an untamable girl ? Jenny ought to have sat beside Mrs. Pettet and sewed by the hour at the embroidery which was to be worked within the year, and which was a fair year's work. As she sewed she might have listened respectfully, so as not to lose a word, to the treasures of Mrs. Pettet's knowledge and discretion then dispensed to her. Mrs. Pettet, though she did not waste words either in petting or in scolding, had a clever country woman's talent for racy conversation, and was fond of exercising the talent and discoursing on the life which she had seen in service. But Jenny was not so minded. She would be up and away on the slightest excuse, or on no excuse at all. She would be seeing Punch performed, and following the performance half through the town \u2014 or she would be looking at the stump of the sailor's arm which he chose to exhibit as he begged with a placard hung round his neck \u2014 or watching a dog-fight, which she might have left to her brother Rowley \u2014 or peeping at the parties of gay folks come down for a frolic and a row on the river, and having buns and dishes of tea in one or other of the great rotunda tea-rooms. What could be done with such a girl ? Mrs. Pettet, .hough very strict in her notions, had no great opinion of"], [119, "Industry. 105 forcing a girl to her duty. \" You may whip the top to spin, but it will stop spinning the moment the force of the whipping is spent. One man may drive a horse to the water, but ten cannot make him drink.\" Mrs. Pettet would only make one more essay at the attainment of the ten pomegranates and the twenty-two bunches of Parmesan violets. If Jenny persisted in de clining the task and in deserting from it, or if she fell lamentably short in the quality of the work done, then, in justice to herself and to her other nieces and nephews, Mrs. Pettet must give her up, and poor apple-faced Rowley with her, and must try the power of clear-sighted judgment and true kindness on another niece and nephew. \" Though I've a sneaking kindness for the gipsy, and though I feel sure that little Rowley, if he had an elder sister such as he ought to have \u2014 a younger mother to be with him \u2014 would be a fine little dog, yet they must go if Jenny won't behave.\" Jenny had made wry faces and pushed up a shoulder at the first sight of the great heap of dreadfully trouble some embroidery which she was expected to work. She did not take more kindly to the proposal when it was anew laid before her, accompanied by the severe alternative, \" Do as I, my sisters, my mother, and my aunts did before you, Jenny, and prove that you are a domestic creature, and not a wild animal ; that you may become fit for something after all, if you can bring yourself to sit for an hour of an early morning, or afternoon, or evening on a stretch of weeks and"], [120, "106 Industry. months, without being glued or tied to your stool, if you can restrain your vagabond arms and legs, and more than your arms and legs. Either that, or make up your mind that I will have done with you and little Rowley, and you shall go back to Dorsetshire as sure as there are nuts on a walnut tree or pickles on a head of barley. You have a little time to make up your mind, a year to come and go in, but don't go for to think a year is an eternity. Child, it is the tick of a clock, the taking of a pinch of snuff. More than that, if you sulk and loiter during the first three months, you will spend all the remaining nine running after the first three, in order to catch them again, in vain.\" Jenny was not convinced. When was a foolish girl of fourteen convinced that a year was not a long lifetime, and that the most unacceptable task, if ordained, must be met, or its penalty endured ? She had, too, that unreasoning obstinacy which besets only children or childish natures. Jenny still made faces privately at the embroidery. She pmt it aside, and determined to forget it for a long while at least. But she could not succeed in forgetting it altogether, not though the next day was one marked with a white stone in Jenny's calendar. It was Green- wich Fair, and Mrs. Pettet, though she would not suffer Jenny to attend it alone, indulged her and Rowley by walking with them, early in the day, through the stalls and past the shows, buying for them certain little dainties of apples and gingerbread. Notwithstanding this, a precise air which clung about the little party, and sundry protests which Mrs. Pettet had found herself called upon"], [121, "Industry. 107 to utter, drew down upon the group somewhat pointed animadversions and charges of being Methodists and dissenters. Even when Jenny, later in the day, was confined to the house, and chafing at the confinement, she could indemnify herself in a measure by watching from the balcony the famous diversion of lads and lasses running down a Greenwich hill. She itched to join in the helter-skelter headlong run, let her be seized and pulled about in the game ; and this, though her aunt protested that it was a hoyden game only fit for children, and that it was a scandal to see grown-up people having so little sense of propriety as to engage in it. But throughout the fair, like the patch-work quilts hung before the booths, there hovered in the background of Jenny's imagination, haunting and harassing it, these groups and wreaths of deep, tediously pierced, and dotted masses of coloured silks as she had seen them indicated in the pattern. And when Jenny knelt at night to say her prayers, the phantasmagoria and horror of untouched work rose up like a confusing, oppressing stained-glass window between her and the heavenly light. When Greenwich Fair was over, Jenny went so far as slowly, and with but half-concealed pettishness, to lug into the balcony, from a corner of her own and her aunt's room, the frame, the canvas and the silks, where they had been placed to confront her sleeping and waking, and stare her out of countenance. Mrs. Pettet took no notice, and Jenny proceeded to"], [122, "108 Industry. begin on her pattern. She put her head on one side, and shut one eye while she looked hard with the other at the first bud or two, and then she threaded and inserted her needle. She pulled and ravelled her silks, soiled and dragged her canvas, and pushed the frame from her in a passion. She had to be reminded by her aunt to carry in the materials before retiring to rest, and not leave them outside exposed to the night-dews and the chance of rain. When she had \" the horrid thing \" in her room again she covered up the frame closely with an old shawl, just to keep the thing out of her sight ; and when the orange gauze, and the sombre greens, blues, and purples, were safely hidden, she felt triumphant for a little space, like an ostrich that has poked its head into the sand, and thus made believe that it is out of the range of the hunters. Jenny did not touch the embroidery afresh for weeks and weeks \u2014 not till there came a spell of rainy weather and a dearth of events in the town, so far as she was concerned. In the protracted gloom of an endless afternoon at such a season, she bethought herself of her untried task, and, in lack of other entertainment, placed herself before the frame, drew a long breath, and actually began and finished a whole leaf. The em broidered leaf was so much richer, more raised and life like than the embossed leaf in the pattern, and Jenny was so surprised and pleased that she was as still as a mouse, as fixed as is a limpet to a rock, working busily til! supper-time, when she had the gratification of seeing com pleted a little cluster of leaves. \" You never sewed all that bunch, Jenny,\" asserted Rowley, coming in from"], [123, "Industry. 109 his cricket, and opening his eyes, as he hopped about her. \" The skies are going to fall,\" protested Mrs. Pettet, caustically, shaking her cap and yellow ribands. The skies were not likely to fall for any change of girl nature, when Jenny danced a jig with Rowley to the tune of an improvised song, of which the words were, \" I sewed it \u2014 I sewed it. I shall sew the rest. It is so nice, it is grand indeed ! There is no bit of pleasure equal to working embroidery when one has set one's mind to it.\" Jenny was of the same mind next day, and would have sat down to embroider after she had supped the bread and milk which Mrs. Pettet gave her for breakfast, but Mrs. Pettet would not permit that. \"There is a time for everything, as there was a time for the Stuarts.\" Jenny must help her aunt to look after the charwoman, and learn to cook and char \u2014 in the mean time doing more harm than good by her cooking and charing. Afternoon or evening was the time for embroidery, unless she chose to rise in the morning and work at her frame before breakfast. In Jenny's new-born zeal she did so choose, and Mrs. Pettet glanced at the girl from beneath her drooping brows, scrutinising, speculating, hoping against hope. Flad Jenny turned over an altogether new leaf? Was the girl in a fair way of being reformed without further trouble \u2014 cured by the embroidery as by a miracle ? Mrs. Pettet had built some trust on the embroidery, but she had not been half so sanguine as this enthusiasm justi-"], [124, "Industry. 110 fied. Is only the fire which burnt so hotly did not expend its fuel as swiftly ! Jenny, very observant where there was neither pains nor patience required for the observation, was privy to her aunt's shifting opinion of her, as well as to Rowley's open-mouthed mystification ; the consciousness lent a pleasant spur and stimulant, and kept up her dawning appreciation of work and its rewards. She was very sus ceptible to praise, and in truth to notice of any kind, and was not without danger of growing up a vain puss, if her vanity, which as yet had received small food to grow fat upon, did not get a salutary check. For many mornings Jenny electrified and edified Mrs. Pettet by struggling out of bed and sitting down demurely to work at an early hour. In the afternoons Jenny sat as demurely bearing her aunt company, and making rapid progress in the embroidery with which she had fallen in love. For there was no absence of cleverness in Jenny's head and hands, if she would only persevere in turning them to account, tutoring and taxing them to pay their debt. The garlands and clusters of silken flowers growing under Jenny's fingers, dim and dusky as the silken leaves were contrasted with the natural petals, stiff as the shapes and turns of the artificial flowers showed them selves after the matchless grace of the real flowers, had yet a design, a beauty of their own, quaint, fantastic though formal, like the beauty of the borders of Indian woven shawls, or of tapestry betraying the original pen cilling of great artists. Jenny, a passionate lover of"], [125, "Industry. 111 beauty, felt this, though she could not have expressed, in the least, its fascination. Mrs. Pettet was no longer slack of encouragement, and of such sources of inspiration as she could provide. She told Jenny that her piece of embroidery would be the masterpiece of the family embroidery. Part of it should be framed in some fine-grained and polished wood, and preserved under glass, in order that Jenny might still have the trophy of her industry when she was an old woman. Mrs. Pettet had not been able to retain any part of hers, but she did not mind that, since she had saved the pattern which Jenny was copying religiously. Yes, Mrs. Pettet called it religious to work devotedly, devoutly, like the first workers in the intention of the work, and according to one's capacity of fulfilling the intention. She recalled for Jenny's benefit the stories told by the minister of the chapel of which her father had been an official, when he had visited the family in the room where the girls sat at work. There was the primary meaning of the word sampler, \" example,\" speci men. Thus the manner in which each girl worked her embroidery would prove a faint foreshadowing of the manner in which she would do the work of life. The results of the embroidery was an \"earnest\" or \" arles \" of the flowers and fruit which the girl might rear, tend, and gather, going at last with her hands full of them, and her head crowned with them, within the immortal gates, on the great harvest day. The minister had spoken of Penelope and her web, by which she dis tanced her importunate suitors ; of Queen Matilda and"], [126, "Industry. 112 her Bayeux tapestry, in which she and her maidens re corded the exploits of her warlike husband and his knights; of nuns immured in cloisters, who gave not their afternoons alone, but their entire lives to the em broidery- of priests' stoles and of altar cloths, in the mistaken idea of serving God better than if they were free in their own homes, where they might be dutiful daughters, chaste, obedient wives, or faithful, tender mothers, as God ordained. Jenny's imagination was caught, her sense of honour piqued, her heart touched by these stories- Everything was going on as swimmingly as might be, when the dank, misty autumn weather cleared up to a bright late October frost. \" I shall have the more light for my embroidery,\" proclaimed Jenny. But the next afternoon she hesitated a little, and looked longingly out upon the broad lights and shadows, the tawny leaves, quivering in their crisp ness, the fleet deer, and the pedestrians in the Park. Mrs. Pettet was by no means perfect, and in her im perfection she was inclined to keep her niece too closely confined. Open air and exercise had not been considered a necessity of Mrs. Pettet's youth, and she had managed to get through life tolerably well with a limited supply of both. In the same way she did not comprehend that her own companionship, bracing and reasonably cheerful as it was, did not form a sufficient substitute for the com panionship of the young \u2014 fit sympathisers with Jenny. If Mrs. Pettet had been wiser than her generation, she would not have been chagrined, would not have taken the alarm at Jenny's fit of the gapes on this or any other fine after-"], [127, "Industry. 113 noon ; and so would not have precipitated the evil which she sought to avert by the polite clenching dismissal of Margaret Copeland, her own favourite, when Margaret came to ask Jenny to walk with her to Deptford, in order to see Martin Copeland's ship sail, and Jenny had been faltering in her refusal. Jenny was decidedly low and stupid after Margaret Copeland's departure. She did very little work ; what she worked she did wrong, and spent the most of the time in unpicking. The unpicking was not finished when she had to give up embroidering for the night, stretch her cramped arms and legs and make the extra vagant statement, \" This unpicking is my black dog ; I detest it.\" \" See that your black dog does not climb on to your back and sit fast there, my girl,\" insinuated Mrs. Pettet sarcastically. Although she was a fine elderly woman, Mrs. Pettet was often very provoking with her unsparing tongue. Jenny slept-in next morning, notwithstanding that she had not gone to Deptford with Margaret Copeland, who was up with the lark and away to market to spare her mother's bodily strength as well as her purse. By the time Jenny was dressed it was not worth while to sit down to work before breakfast, or to do anything except run down from the turret and inquire what the Lanes \u2014 the occupants of the house \u2014 were about, as Jenny had not seen much of them for a length of time. The less fenny saw of the Lanes the better, Mrs. Pettet i"], [128, "Industry. 114 \u2022was inclined to judge. Though they were respect able, in the estimation of their neighbours, and the family of the owner of one of the larger wherries, and of Mrs. Pettet's landlord also, yet they were one of those robustly independent families which Mrs. Pettet held in such high disapprobation as approached to horror. There were father and mother, grown-up sons and daughters in the household, and each, however young, had his or her will, which he or she exercised vigorously, irrespective of the wills of the others. It seemed no more than a fortuitous circumstance that the Lanes were on the whole well-disposed, and had some natural affec tion for each other. The Lanes on their part did not mind Mrs. Pettet's objection to them, while they stigmatised her as a stuck up old tyrant of a widow. From a mixture of rough and ready large-heartedness and love of teasing, the Lanes tried to get her queer, wild fish of a niece as much out of her hands as possible. As the Lanes were the family of Mrs. Pettet's landlord, and as there was not a great deal which she could positively condemn in their acts, Mrs. Pettet could not forbid Jenny's keeping company with them. They were her nearest neighbours. But she was always uneasy when Jenny was with Luce or Patty, Jerry or Frank Lane. Now it was with a hardly restrained groan of apprehen sion and disappointment that Mrs. Pettet leamt from Jenny, when she rushed up to eat her breakfast, that Jerry Lane was going out in the wherry for a diy's"], [129, "Industry. 115 hunting of clams and other shell-fish, and had offered tc take her along with his sisters, for a holiday on the river. Mrs. Pettet did not pronounce an interdict on the ex pedition in the same way as she had come forward to dismiss Margaret Copeland's harmless proposal. Stiffen ing into sternness she said to herself, \" The child is none of mine after all ; her father's folk are of the Lane sort ; not so bad for people that are rank worldly. I suppose it is ill taking out of the flesh what is bred in the bone ; least ways I cannot mend this girl \u2014only the grace of God and herself can mend her. If the seven devils of laziness, boldness, giddiness, and the like, are to come back into her, and her last state is to be worse than the first, sure it is no fault of mine, nor of nobody's \u2014 not even of these Lanes \u2014 it is the girl's own fault.\" So Jenny was suffered to depart. To all appearance she went in the very abandonment of glee and recklessness, as if to indemnify herself for her late sobriety and stead fastness. \" I knowed how it would be, and how it will be,\" Mrs. Pettet meditated sadly, twirling her thumbs and remark ing how soon the October sun sank low in the horizon. In winter-time Jenny, with the best endeavour, could make small way with her embroidery, and when winter was over and gone she would only have spring in which to complete two-thirds of her task. \" And my word is my word : I shan't go from it \u2014 it be she who has gone. The tiring time has come at last. I long looked for it, and I was a fool to think such as Jenny would ever escape it. She has thrown over her I 2"], [130, "Industry 116 embroidery from this day. Her zeal has gone clean out like the snuff of a candle, just as Scripture says there is a fair show of goodness as vanishes like the morning cloud and the early dew. I was an old fool ever to believe that Jenny could stick in. If she be not drownded with them Lanes, she has returned to her good-for-nothing ness, like the dog and the sow to the tricks of their kind.\" Jenny was not \"drownded\" this time, certainly; but Mrs. Pettet was not appeased by Jenny's share of the fish. But she did not refuse them on account of the unscrupulous hands that had caught them : on the con trary, she cooked the clams in the most skilful manner, and despatched the better part of them, whence they had come, with her \" duty,\" to the Lanes. But Jenny was only restored to Mrs. Pettet that she might press a request which was backed by the weight of resolute Mrs. Lane's influence. Mrs. Lane mounted to the turret for the purpose of bullying Mrs. Pettet, and seconding powerfully Jenny's motion. It was to the effect that Jenny should go on another of these days in the Lanes' boat to Greenhithe, to have an afternoon's nutting in the woods with the lads and lasses, and after wards proceed with Mrs. Lane to the house of her sister, who was married to a yeoman \" down Kent.\" The yeoman was having the last shaking of his orchard in the apples that liked a touch of the frost, and the last brewst of his cyder brewed. There was to be a friendly feast on the occasion, as the fine weather would soon be over. \" Your lass is main slim and sallow, dame. Happen"], [131, "Industry. 117 she'll be the better of a little knocking about ; and you know she's safe with me.\" \" Yes, from right down wrong and bodily danger,\" muttered Mrs. Pettet ; \" as for the rest, you may ask the girl herself, Missus Lane.\" Mrs. Pettet spoke so shortly that few could have guessed what she felt when she added faintly, \"Jenny will choose for herself. In course I'm obliged by your good will.\" Jenny consented with all her heart, and set off like a crazed creature. After all, it was true what Mrs. Lane said, that the fine weather could not last much longer. Of a necessity the boating, nutting, and fall feasting, would soon be at an end for the season ; \u2014 if their effects had been as tran sitory. Jenny had not wanted to be unsettled and un hinged, weary as she was of well-doing ; but she was unsettled and unhinged thoroughly. Joined to the revival of the old fickleness and fidgetti ness, Jenny, when she came across the abandoned em broidery, experienced an amount of vexation and shame which Mrs. Pettet called the just portion of those, young or old, who have gone back in their career, who have had hold of their duty, and, having had experience of its pain and yet its blessedness, have let it go. Jenny took the first word of blame, and assailed her aunt with something like a reproach. \" If you'd only set me some job there is use and sense in ! I'd mend or make my own or Rowley's clothes, or even your clothes, auntie, if you'd let me.\""], [132, "118 Industry. Thus Jenny complained half crying in her peevishness,. and in loathing of her late welcome employment. \" There are Luce and Patty Lane, the one apprenticed to a mantua-maker, the other to a straw-hat maker, and they are making such sweets of hoods to themselves and their mother after work hours. I could do that now, though I was silly and would not darn my holes when I came first. I was only thirteen then, auntie ; I ain't such a fool now. But to spend my days over ugly old embroidery, which will never be of service to mortal man or woman, it is cruel hard, auntie.\" \" Jenny, the embroidery ain't ugly to them who have eyes to see it,\" answered Mrs. Pettet severely, but repress ing her indignation ; \" you thought what you had done the loveliest piece of work you had ever beheld, no farther gone than a fortnight, before you took your tantrums again ; and always as the embroidery gets on, it grows lovelier, I can tell you that, if you will believe me. There are more kinds of apprenticeship than one : besides, Luce and Patty Lane, who are apprenticed to trader, are three or four years older than you. I have said it, Jenny Pettet, that you'll never be a child of mine if you do not work that 'ere embroidery, which trained me and my sisters, always forgetting your poor mother, and our aunts afore us, so that we never grudged sitting long and close, pro vided it repaid us by being the goodliest embroidery of its sort, and eddicated our fingers, eyes, and taste in what was rare comely. You'll pack to Dorset with Rowley, and I'll find how I can manage with your cousins, Nan and Nat. A year agone I tried to be content with your"], [133, "Industry. 119 fly-away patching instead of with your embroidering ; but I was weak and wrong : moreover, I have said the word \u2014 it is the embroidery and my house here, or no em broidery and your father's and stepmother's house in Dorsetshire.\" Jenny ignored the substance of this speech, and began of her own accord to mend and remodel her wardrobe and that of Rowley (she did not dare to touch her aunt's), just as if she had received carte blanche to sub stitute wilful unregulated experiments with the needle for the finished performance of the embroidery. But Jenny's makings and mendings fared no better than the embroidery. Mrs. Pettet could not afford new cloth for Jenny to waste, and Jenny speedily lost conceit of attempting \u2014 no attempt for a 'prentice hand \u2014 to turn and make up, at her own discretion, old stuff. The Lanes, who had promised Jenny patterns and lessons, were even quicker in departing from their promises. They were not unfriendly women of their kind, but they were full of their own individual affairs, and they were not quite so much women of their word as was Mrs. Pettet. Then it was exactly the old errors of Jenny's ways over again, except that the errors were more inveterate. Jenny was up and she was down ; she was out and she was in ; she would try now a seam at her clothes, now a stitch in her embroidery. She had grown hardened, and was able to trifle and make believe to work with the embroidery over which she had been in earnest for a period of weeks."], [134, "Industry. 120 Jenny succeeded in worrying Mrs. Pettet \u2014 wiry as she was \u2014 into a fever by her flights during these last weeks. Going out one chilly morning to the market, Mrs. Pettet returned sick and ill, and retired very unwillingly to bee1 shivering. After dozing for several hours, during which Jenny was at her wanderings, she woke up to look out on Jenny with eyes which no longer knew the girl, and opened shaking lips which spoke to Jenny, making strange allusions to her as if she were another person. It was a dreadful shock to the girl. It is a sad era in any girl's life when the reasonable speech to which she has been accustomed to listen, is suddenly transformed into the babbling of madness. And here there was remorse barbing and envenoming regret. To afford remorse a fitting field, Jenny was not unfeeling or unkind, al though she had been very thoughtless. But she had not been conscious till now how much regard she had enter tained for Mrs. Pettet, whom she had thwarted and tormented. She had been sensible of the reality of her aunt's regard, so far surpassing anything she had known from her father and stepmother ; she had cherished in her memory all the solid indulgences which Mrs. Pettet, quiet and dry as she was, had furnished for her and Rowley ; furnishing them silently, as if the old woman did not even make a claim on the gratitude of the boy and girl for whom she catered. Jenny summoned the neighbours and ran herself for a doctor, whose fiat was not consoling. Mrs. Pettet was down with fever, which would run its course. lasting many days, and might go hard with her. Even"], [135, "Industry. 121 though she recovered, she would not be \"herself' till the fever left her. Jenny must depend largely on her own resources for nursing her aunt. Rowley was too much scared and too young to be trusted. The Lanes would not be unneigh bourly, but they were desperately busy on their own account, as usual, and they had a horror of infection. Besides, Mrs. Lane distressed Jenny by speaking before the sick woman's face, without speculation as that face was, as if Mrs. Pettet were already dying or dead. Margaret Copeland would run in sometimes, and help Jenny to sit with her friend ; but on Margaret's shoul ders, tender and weak as Jenny's, the burden of a whole household already rested. With her bursting heart, Jenny was willing to nurse Mrs. Pettet, so that she were but counted worthy, and if by her nursing she could atone for the troubles which she had brought on her guardian. The very first after noon that Jenny sat by her aunt, she took out her embroidery, and cried bitterly, unseen and unheard now. Bowing her head over it, she prayed : \" Oh, God Almighty and Lord Jesus, if thou wilt make auntie well again, please God, I shall never, never offend her more, but shall sew my embroidery right out as she wished, that I may win the right to stay with her and nurse her for the rest of her dear life.\" But it was one thing to mourn for evil and another to repair it ; it was one thing to pray and another to receive the answer which Jenny desired yet had not deserved. Still she must trust, though God should slay her in"], [136, "Industry. 122 slaying Mrs. Pettet, and she was thankful to work at her embroidery during the long hours she had to watch beside Mrs. Pettet when nothing could be done, and neither food nor medicine was required. \" If I had not my embroidery to occupy me in a way, I believe I should go mad, like auntie,\" Jenny said to herself. In addition Jenny had always the faint hope that she might yet show to auntie how she had obeyed her friend at last, when the old woman could no longer utter her wishes, or recognise their accomplishment. Jenny had fixed to finish her embroidery, whether it were within the year or not, though there was no question now of her retention or aismissal, though she had been weighed in the balance and found wanting, nor of Rowley's, who proved so good a little boy in the present strait. He helped his sister as far as he could, and gave as little trouble as possible. But what did it matter about re tention or dismissal if only auntie's will were done ? AVhen Margaret Copeland could snatch an hour from the avocations for which there was urgent call, or spare an hour from the sleep of which she had need, she came and sat with Jenny. Margaret applauded Jenny for resuming her embroidery, and brought forth some of her own work, which she carried with her. \"lam fain to gain more time for my work,\" Margaret would say, in her eager, bright way ; \" so that it is a boon to me to be allowed to sit up an hour later with your dear auntie. I am afraid it's a piece of selfishness and not of friendliness, Jenny, though you know I do lovt Mrs. Pettet, and owe her much. I do not know in my"], [137, "Industry. 123 own experience if work is a comfort, but I am sure it is a great happiness. It is so much more interesting than play, now, isn't it, Jane ?\" Jenny had come to know in her experience that work was a comfort, and would never forget those November days when she returned to her allegiance, which had been brief enough before, and clove to her embroidery as for dear life, in order that her heart might not break or her brain reel while she besought the Hearer of prayer to grant that if her aunt should open eyes to which the soul was restored but once again, they might see her striving in sorrow and diffi culty to fulfil her appointed task. At the first dawn of Mrs. Pettet's recovery, Jenny was only too happy to work on, and to declare with Margaret Copeland that work was great happiness. She was so serene, so content. At the same time she felt so full of capability, although she was very tired with watch ing and with broken sleep. Nothing seemed too hard for her, as nothing was too hard for Margaret Copeland. She fervently trusted that her old spirit of wilfulness and restlessness had departed from her, and that her spirit had come to her again like the spirit of a docile child. Under the influence of that tranquil light, the charm of her work, which Jenny had once before perceived, returned in greater and more abiding force. The pome granates and violets rising up under her touch grew always more ravishingly lovely, and the truth of Mrs. Pettet's assertion was confirmed. The background of the embroidery, the last the work, in place of being"], [138, "Industry. 124 mere meandering lines, as Jenny had supposed, de veloped into the most delicate tracery, like a moonlight reflection of minor blossom and leaf. Jenny was always finding out something new and more charming in this marvellous groundwork, until she ended by thinking it still more beautiful than the rich and deep wreaths and clusters which it reflected as in a dreamy mist. \"Jenny, you'll have that embroidery done before your year is out,\" vowed Mrs. Pettet, when her voice was heard again in its old accents. \" I got such a step with your illness, auntie,\" replied Jenny, with a smile that quivered on her lips. \" Nonsense, child,\" Mrs. Pettet declared, doggedly ; \" my illness must have been a great hindrance to you, so that it will not be your fault if you cannot keep to the terms. I must e'en go from my word for once, seeing that the spirit has been made good, and it is only in the letter that there is aught wanting. Jenny, our old minister used to say that it was the office of kings and rulers, whether in heaven or on earth, to grant amnesties \u25a0 \u2014 free pardons for offences and the restoration of for feited goods so soon as the offender repented and was in a state to receive grace. More by token, I am con sulting my own interest, for I cannot want your company now, Jenny, and I am sure that Rowley will do well and grow up a credit to me, with a wise, kind elder sister to act as his best friend, and to help me in looking after him.\""], [139, "'ij rv.

The gift must become a gift of ministry, else the neglected or misem ployed talent proves a curse instead of a blessing ; and there are few heavier curses than that involved in selfish and evil adventure. Surely a piteous and tragic spectacle is presented by the man or the woman who, endowed with the first of intellectual gifts, nature's crown of re source and expedient, suffers the crown to rust in sloth, to be soiled by folly, degraded in a low cause, or clutched for a personal mean ambition, even for family provision and aggrandizement. The miserable"], [140, "Enterprise. 126 conclusion certainly comes when talents run to waste, soil inexplicably, midway, in their possessor's career, and bring him or her to ruin by a monstrous excess of sense less speculation, or by wildly unnatural and morbidly spasmodic effort. Thus, originality, like enthusiasm, falls into unmerited disgrace, and listeners hear one of the faithless cries of the day against leaving the beaten track, because in new paths there is danger. As if there could be noble goal the road to which did not bristle with hardship and tribu lation ! Yet real heroes and heroines can traverse these roads, and in place of sustaining harm, derive benefit from the rough ways by which they pass. So again, in the art which pictures life there is a strong tendency to choose commonplace and to in dulge in stale cynicism. Women are classified easily. They are divided into crafty and cruel women, who hare even amazing genius, and into good, innocent, helpless women, who blindly love, and are blindly dragged hither and thither by man and circumstances. The only variety allowed in the last class, save indeed when the character is a pathetic child in the hands of great writers, is that she may be\u2014 along with her mawkishness \u2014 selfish, callous in her superficiality, asking questions she ought never to ask, making experiments she ought never to make, while retaining the possibility of leaping backward in a moment to her primitive state of ignorant helpless ness, or of launching forward, after a still more mira culous fashion, into generous, self-forgetful womanhood. Not such was the definition of the wisest of men, who"], [141, "Enterprise. 127 \u2014 strange and shameful for Christian men and women to recall it \u2014 lived an Eastern life among Eastern women, removed from the pretty slaves of the harem.

Witness the fact of superior ingenuity and power of adaptation in whole nations over other nations. This general result must be the conse quence of training more than of endowment. Quite young children display freshness of thought and corresponding ardour in their games, and may be encouraged in the development of distinctive attributes. But it is no un common thing to hear boys and girls applauded for at taining an object by plodding along a well-worn course (meritoriously without question) ; while other boys and girls who have reached the same goal by devices all their own, demanding perhaps as much, or more trouble, were"], [142, "128 Enterprise. only slightingly noticed as having arrived at the end through hardly warrantable means. Give system its due ; but allow also what is due to invention, which is at once the creator and the overthrower of system. There are few sane persons to be found now who will openly declare that to work is a disgrace ; or that any woman who condescends, because she feels it a duty, to work, descends from her rank as a gentlewoman. But many thousands of women still live out this exploded opinion. Daughters of poor professional men, hangers on, and dependents upon more fortunate or more ener getic relations, wives of incapacitated or incapable husbands, widows, and spinsters, who are only a little removed from starvation, prefer comparative starvation, and any form of dependence, to chalking out a separate career for themselves. Of some of these women it may be said that they look forward to marriage as the one natural solution for their difficulties. Let it be so ; I do not know that the holy state of matrimony is dignified by being treated as a refuge for the destitute. But there are many \u2014 those who are wives already, widows, and elderly single women, who cannot look forward to marriage as the conclusion of their struggles. Yet there remains the striking disinclination on the part of women to take the remedy in their own hands. And the tendency does not spring from idleness, for the mass of such women are busy striving \" to make the way and the end meet.\" It arises rather from an almost incorrigible reluctance to undertake the smallest independent venture. I may be reproached so this assertion in the face of"], [143, "Enterprise. 129 the multitude of English women who are working, or crying out for fairly remunerative work, and cannot get it. But I stand firm by my assertion, that if all the women in Great Britain who need work set themselves to find it, they would get it, for their honest claim cannot be resisted. I doubt that there are many among you girls who indulge a lurking opposition to doing anything (if you can help it) which shall make your lot differ from what is in your eyes the lot of women. I know that the prejudice is to be found where one would least expect it. It is to be found even among working women themselves, and I must quote, at the risk of confuting myself, the sentiments which one distinguished working woman puts into the mouth of another working woman of her creation, with regard to the latter's portionless daughter. The girl is not to be taught or trained to work for herself (though she is the eldest child of a poor widow), she is to have \" her day \" of household interests and affections, worsted-work, music, parties, familiar com panionship and friendship, and, above all, her day of dreaming. In the name of truth, does not the girl who works have her day also ? Is not work as well as play a glad thing in itself when hope is high and all the world is young ? A working girl must be hard treated if she has no holiday time for home ties and social gatherings, which will be all the dearer and gayer to her because she must hoard the moments for them, and take care if possible not to lose a grain of their kindliness and brightness, Has a working K"], [144, "Enterprise. 130 woman no companions nor \" true, true\" friends, and is her life destitute of dreams, higher and purer the farther that they stretch beyond the little world of self? Charity or love should begin at home ; but if it begin and end there, it is but a poor kind of love after all. Has this working woman who has recorded her senti ments for the benefit of the rising generation ever looked closely, with her exquisite power of analysis, beyond con ventional girlhood into the vacuity, the unanswered yearnings, the mean rivalries, and the senseless bicker ings that make up much of the lives of girls who cannot find sufficient household occupation to engage their attention ? Certainly these girls have missed the posi tion of the luxurious, feted and feting fairy princess, who is generally represented as a motherless girl, or the con dition, still more beatific, of the tranquil, dependent being who lives sunk in the most baseless and graceful of dreams.

There are examples in this country of large families of daughters, all grown up, who cannot be, each"], [145, "Enterprise. 131 of them, continually keeping house, working up the family sewing, or even making her own clothes. Surely the welfare of the third or the fourth, up even to the seventh girl, in a grown-up family, is deserving of some consideration even in novels. Her experience is not quite unworthy of being recorded. It is as worthy as that of the only motherless girl, or the eldest girl where the rest of her sisters, at least, have the consideration to be very young. Perhaps it has been the fault of the elder girls themselves that they have not had their romance out of hand, and been married off one by one as they grew up. But this is a non-marrying age ; and, fault or no fault, large families of unmarried daughters are to be met with in this country, where we have no convents, and have but recently taken to sisterhoods. I am willing to grant to the fullest extent, and in all loyalty, that the man is the head of the woman, her lord, her protector, the provider for her wants, and her guide even while she is more truly his helpmeet than many women wot of. But can the relation only subsist on the condition of the man filling the purse and the woman emptying it ? Are daughters necessarily less dutiful and dear to a father because they maintain themselves in honest and honourable independence, and even in extreme cases contribute to his support and solace, giving back a small part of what they have received ? If the father is mag nanimous, and is capable of respecting as well as loving his daughters, the day on which he is convinced that his helpless girls can help themselves may be the gladdest day in his life. K 2"], [146, "Enterprise. 132 Have brothers, husbands, or sons, no pride, as well as tenderness, by right of which they may rejoice in behold ing tokens of power as well as of purity, patience, and affection in their women. Are not purity, patience, and affection a greater homage from the strong than from the weak ? If a woman's humblest, heartiest service is ever a crown to a man, is it not a more kingly crown when it is accepted from a queen in her own right, than from a puppet or a baby ? I admit, as freely as ever advocate for domesticity admitted it, that home is a woman's citadel ; that her maintenance there of her husband's, brother's, father's, or son's honour and comfort, and her bringing up of the children whom God may have intrusted to her, form her first business. But I utterly deny that the sanctity of any save a Turkish home, must be invaded by the woman's having an independent calling with its rights and duties, or that, when it is desirable, a wise and active woman cannot, like the virtuous woman of Proverbs, combine her provision for a happy home with other work. The thing has been frequently done, and well done. Take one case among many others. Margaret Camegie of Southesk, at the time of the Union, obtained her father's reluctant consent to her marriage with a poor suitor, the younger brother of the famous Fletcher of Saltoun. Some time after her marriage she found that her husband's income from the mill at Saltoun, which his brother had given him on lease, was narrow enough. She thereiore represented to her brother-in-law that, if she were to visit Holland, and such of its manufactories of"], [147, "Enterprise. 133 fine linen as the influence of her rank and the fancied in competence of her sex might throw open to her, she was confident that she could learn the secret of fine linen weaving. Margaret Fletcher started on the expedition, accom panied by two skilled mechanics disguised as lackeys. I am afraid that Margaret went too far in acting out the proverb that stratagems are allowable in love and war \u2014 the war of trades as well as of nations. But anyhow she was thoroughly successful. Being a woman who saw both near and far, she picked up by the way other valuable information on which she had not reckoned. She returned to Scotland with her own and her lackeys knowledge of how to weave \" Hollands fine \" for the \" sarking \" of the nobility and gentry, and also with the knowledge of how to make pot barley. In addition to the superior linen manufactories which were set a-going and flourished at Saltoun, the whole 01 the pot barley used by the multifarious kale-suppers ot Scotland, was for a while prepared at Saltoun. Mrs. Fletcher was the presiding genius of the double concern, and for several hours of each day was present in the mill. Yet so little did she neglect her family affairs that her entire happiness in her husband was a noted fact in her history. The son who succeeded to the fortune which she made, as well as to his uncle's estate of Saltoun, had so much of his mother's sound sense and breadth of faculty, and was so carefully trained under her eye, that he made a figure among the statesmen of his day, and was raised to the peerage as Lord Milton."], [148, "Enterprise. 134 That \" God helps those who help themselves \" is an aphorism ; it is likewise true that good men help and pay heed to good women who are earnest, and indefatigable as well as good. With all my poor strength, and for the sake of inex perienced girls and working women, I denounce those writings of the present day, however graced by wit and fancy, which men and, in some cases, women have written in short-sightedness or in heartlessness. These writings are calculated to relax and enervate still farther weak minds, to pamper headstrong wills, and to in toxicate the idle vanity of silly girls ; while the same writings sour and embitter worthier and more con scientious girls. As an instance, there is a grave injury done to young governesses when one of the most highly cultivated and benevolently disposed of contempo rary writers chooses to depict governess life as a weak coveting of what is confessedly but glitter and glamour at the best \u2014 the selfish idleness of the grown-up mem bers of the family in which the governess is but a hireling. The single resource of the poor little girl \u2014 of which, had she known what real womanliness was, she would have been heartily ashamed \u2014 is to fling open the floodgates of her shallow heart to the most foolish and extravagant passion for an unfortunate man who ought to have been completely pre-engaged and beyond the reach of her attractions. Then follows the girl's compulsory marriage while in her right mind \u2014 so far as she has a mind \u2014 to a still more unfortunate elderly gentleman, with all the tragic elements which such a"], [149, "Enterprise. 135 marriage involves. That the girl should wax heroic, and emerge from her toils a somewhat higher order of being, is due to the great genius of the author, hardly to the possibilities in the heroine or to the early stage of her history. In like manner it is holding out false and misleading lights to our girls to offer to them frivolous travesties of heroines, however clever, and bid them believe that by a wave of the magician's wand such heroines are expanded and elevated into noble and gentle women. I shall not dwell on the farther wrong done to both men and women by a master in literature who perpetually photographs women, and men too, not only in the attitude of deciding between rival claimants for their regard, but as the fickle tools of passion, ambition, or circumstance, passing from one claimant to another on the slightest conceivable grounds and by the swiftest, most bewildering transitions. I shall simply record that this master seems to look upon love \u2014 the love of women especially \u2014 as a kind of fatalism most frequently called forth by hardly reputable attributes. These delineations deserved to be reprobated when they were merely folly speaking to folly in Minerva press fashion. They are not less, but more worthy of con demnation, when they employ in the present day the genius and art of gifted minds. These deliberately low-toned delineations of life and character, which receive from high quarters the highest praise, to which they are entitled by their ability, though not by their Christian morality, are a more insidious evil than is the existence"], [150, "Enterprise. 136 os what is vile in literature. To boast of these works that they have never injured manliness or womanliness is only to proclaim the inferior standard which the authors hold alike for themselves and their neighbours. The consistent result of such teaching ought to be a generation without faith, enthusiasm, or earnestness. There are honourable exceptions to this glorification of the commonplace and the frivolous among modern writers of every degree of merit. There are men and women of genius who have not bowed the knee to Baal, who have kept during their whole lives an ideal, and a Christian ideal, whose heroes, while they are mortal, are true men, and whose women in their human weakness are yet earnest and dutiful. I may be looked upon as insisting too frequently and gravely on the spirit of modern fiction and its effects. But not merely do its popular pages reflect the opinions and tastes of the time ; I have also warrant in thus bringing fiction prominently forward because of its sweeping tide, which must have a purpose to fulfil, and because I for one would never exclude girls from drink ing from it, on its purer and more refreshing side. The extent to which modem girls, without asking leave, do read fiction, and are influenced by it, is, I venture to say, my sufficient justification. What more can I urge on girls \u2014 those of them who have the spirit of invention \u2014 in order that I may incite them to its exercise, not in making themselves odd or in indulging in questionable escapades, but in bringing to perfection, either as amateurs or pro-"], [151, "Enterprise. 137 fessionals, whatever gift of art, taste, or organisation is in them ? I should resolve, if I were an enterprising girl be ginning life, that come what might in the form of adversity to me or to my kindred of either sex, I should never, so help me God, be inextricably stranded, while a remnant of health was mine, as I see is the case with so many poor women, mothers even, who have helpless heads besides their own to shelter. In the meantime, I should honour with my highest honour the brave and honest woman who has saved herself from being a burden on her neighbours, and by removing one of their burdens has left them with more power to relieve the infirm and weak. Such a one has become herself a dispenser instead of a recipient of bounty \u2014 has delivered her family in the persons of the young and the old from being engulfed among the wrecks of society. A PEARL. Margaret Copeland lived down by the pier, in an antiquated wooden house, having two gables to the front which was close to the river. All the day long in that house you might see the river flowing by, and the wherries, barges, sloops, and bigger craft (as yet steamers were not) gliding with the tide or stemming it, moving under flapping canvas by a scarcely perceptible motion, or driven along under full sail. Sometimes boats were like things in a dream, coming out of the dim distance and"], [152, "138 Enterprise. vanishing into the dim distance again ; sometimes they were instinct with human skill and effort. In the latter case, muscular rowers and \" smart \" seamen bent to the oars, and manned the masts, making each spar and rag of canvas taut. Occasionally the ships were not complete ships, but mere hulks or skeletons, lying on the stocks; but if their sailors were absent, their carpenters were busy hammering the ships into shape and trim. It might be the incessant life and motion of this picture which had filled Margaret Copeland's soul, from her earliest infancy, with activity and the notion of progress. As a child, she had shown the quality of constructive ness, making her toys as well as playing with them, and never wearying either of the making or the playing. But her favourite game had been copying the occupa tions of older people, and turning them to account in the same way as they did. In following her mother and the maid-servants (for the Copelands were tolerably well to do in those days, and lived up to their means) when they were giving out the household stores, baking, brewing, scrubbing, polishing, nursing the children, or sitting of an afternoon sewing household work, the child showed a curious mixture of native dexterity and appli cation. The only engagement in which little Margaret did not follow the example of her elders was that of enter taining company. Bright and free with her intimate friends, she was painfully shy with strangers. Whether Margaret could have dwindled into an ordinary clever young lady was not tested. She had a different"], [153, "Enterprise. 139 fate from her youth. Her father, a naval surgeon, died while he was abroad with his ship on a remote station ; and Mrs. Copeland was left with a small pension and a large family of six daughters and one son, with none of whom we have much to do except as she or he had to do with Margaret. Margaret was the third daughter, while her brother, Martin, was the second in the family. At the time of her father's death, Margaret was only thirteen years old, while her brother Martin was seventeen, and her sisters ranged from Lizzie, aged nineteen, to Joyce, aged six. To borrow a figure from the water which was con stantly pouring past her house, Mrs. Copeland was left all but swamped ; for her means were far from being equal to her wants. Taking Mrs. Copeland even at her own estimation, she was quite unfit to master the situation. She was one of those women in whom sweetness and a certain simple usefulness form the sole ingredients. And these qualities are acquired very much as a child or a domestic animal may be trained to a limited routine and unreasoning service. She had been an affectionate, compliant wife ; she was an affectionate, indulgent mother; but her very conception of conjugal and maternal duties did not reach beyond ignorant, fostering care, and mild household management. As to furnishing the provision, over the distribution of which she had to preside, she had never so much as dreamt of it, notwith standing that there had never been more than a single exposed life between her and the necessity."], [154, "Enterprise. 140 Mrs. Copeland sat and wept, as if she were minded, like Niobe, to weep herself and her children to stone ; only intermitting her sighing and crying to feed and clothe them, with such food and clothing as she had by her. There she sat, waiting for want to come upon her, like an armed man, and demolish her and her children together, or for some cheering ray to pierce their dark ness, or some way of living to turn up as one, by singular good fortune, may turn up a piece of money or a jewel in sauntering along the highway. A public or a private subscription for the Copelands might be set a-going among richer people, the king might hear of them and send them a donation out of his privy purse, or a benefactor might drop from the skies or rise up out of the river. The only members of the family who objected to this do-nothing and literal take-no-heed-for-to-morrow practice were the blundering lad Martin and Margaret Martin was not clever ; he was anything rather than clear-headed ; but he was manly and reliable. His education at one of the naval schools had been a pro tracted one, and he was just about to be articled to a lawyer in the town, when the news of his father's death arrived, and called upon him to seek employment which would be more speedily remunerative. He committed many errors in the search. His mother was incapable of lending him available advice, and he had no relations, either on the father's or the mother's side, disinterested enough to stand prominently forward and direct him. They preferred to stand aloof, and not run the risk of incurring the crushing weight of a whole family, so many of"], [155, "Enterprise. 141 its members women, just waiting to be suspended round a ivilling neck. At last, Martin very nearly committed a fatal act of injudiciousness. He lost heart and temper in his pursuit of remunerative work, and threw up his higher expectations by apprenticing himself to an old acquaintance of his father's in a ship sailing from Deptford. He should at least cost his mother nothing, and might, if he behaved himself, rise in the course of years to be mate and captain. He tried to console his mother and sisters, and to silence his own doubts, by promising to bring the women boxes of tea and bales of crape from China ; and he wished them all to go to Deptford to see him sail. There was something of a grand spectacle, as well as of a long good-bye, in seeing a large ship sail. But though Martin was a favourite throughout the house, as befitted his solitary sonship and brotherhood, not one of the family, save Margaret, had the forethought or energy to take the proper measures in time. \" Mother, and all you girls, there is no need for us to stick in the world,\" announced Margaret with eager courage the night she came back from Deptford. In some respects she was wont to be reticent and bashful even to her own family, living, as she had lived, in a more or less abstracted atmosphere, engaged with thoughts and speculations with which her mother and sisters had little sympathy. But Margaret was already excited in being the sole narrator of the event of the day to a sympathetic audience. She could tell well any story she had to tell,"], [156, "Enterprise. 142 and had that force of persuasion which accompanies decided conviction. It was significant that in the present case none of her hearers reminded her that three of them were her seniors, and that, to the head of the house, Margaret was still a mere child. Margaret's mother and sisters might have remembered these facts in her absence, but in her presence they forgot her youth and inexperience, much as Louis le Grand's courtiers forgot his low stature so long as they were face to face with their king. Margaret's kindred, with little or no ima gination, believed in her from the beginning to a remark able extent ; while she pined to sway them because she did not think \u2014 she knew that her way was the way, and that in it alone lay her family's deliverance from moral bankruptcy and ruin. \" What would you have us to do, my poor Maggie ?\" inquired the feeble voice of Mrs. Copeland. Her voice was not feeble because she was an invalid, for she was in excellent health, \u2014 a big, fair, small-featured woman ; but there never was any \"body\" either in her voice or in her character. It was suggestive, too, that only Mrs. Copeland called her third daughter \" Maggie.\" The brother and sisters, as well as the neighbours, all said Margaret or Marget; yet Margaret was notbig like her mother. She was a small slight girl, with prominent temples and speaking eyes. When she was animated, she seemed to grow larger and fairer, and her eyes appeared to dart out the words which she was about to speak before she could utter them. She was not naturally handsome, but when she let her spirit out, not a girl in Greenwich, or it might be in great London,"], [157, "Enterprise. 143 could compare with her. Few paused to analyse the attraction, which was that of spirit over matter. The least spirituclle felt it ; and it was to that they referred, when they said after Margaret was older and more in public, \"How well Margaret Copeland looks sometimes. I have seen her face beat all the lily skins and rosy com plexions, the best-formed noses, and the blackest and the bluest eyes in the room. 'Tother times she is quite plain. It is very odd.\" \" Here is what I should do,\" declared Margaret, and it appeared that the girl of thirteen had thought everything out, calculated probabilities, and weighed qualifications. \" I should write and ask our cousins in Wilts whether they could not take Lizzie and Phillis to make themselves useful to the old couple at the farm in return for their board. I should try to get Anne and Nelly on the Brooke bounty \u2014 I think the town would do so much for two of us \u2014 and Anne and Nelly are young enough yet to be regularly trained to trades. I should keep our little Joyce at school \u2014 of course it must be the free school now. For myself, I shall go out at once as a sempstress. I made all my own black frock for poor father, and I did the most of the fitting on of mother's and Lizzie's ; but I am afraid that people would not like to trust me, for a bit, on my own account, so I shall go and work for Miss Gill, Mrs. Pettet's friend ; I am sure she will take me in. Before and after work hours I shall do the cleaning and housekeeping for mother.\" Margaret's unhesitating summary took away her family's breath, and was followed by a loud and general protest,"], [158, "Enterprise. 144 for the summary involved both a coming down to the Copelands' gentility and a blow to their enormous amount of inertia. But the protest proved no more than the inevitable prelude to the adoption of the programme, since there was nobody to concoct and advocate another feasible scheme. Margaret was left the only available daughter (as she had always been at home), while she went out and sewed in a quiet mantua-making establishment. Mantua-makers in those days were not unfrequently ladies of birth and education in reduced circumstances, and their modest businesses were on rather a higher social platform than the great businesses of the dress makers' \" houses \" of the present day. That was one advantage which the last century possessed over the present \u2014 the advantage of unquestionable lady mantua makers and lady abigails. Margaret did not altogether lose her prestige as the daughter of a deceased profes sional man, with fair nurture and middle class connections, by going out and sewing for a wage. It is but fair to Margaret to state that she would not have consented to starve or to be in any sense a parasite, in order to avoid being sent to Coventry by her circle. \" Work is all one to me,\" she used to say, with her bright, quick face, \" so that it is honest work. I like it all. I am afraid I must be low-minded, for I do find something to interest me in making a bed and putting on a fire, and I take pride in mopping a floor and scouring a cupboard on what I call my own pattern, as well as in \u2022stu king together shell-work brackets, and moulding wax-"], [159, "Enterprise. 145 fruit. My hands ? \u2014 why I can wash my hands afterwards ; there is the whole Thames if I want water, and I can use sand-paper to rub out the scores, and elder-flower water to soften the chaps : if I could not, there are worse things in the world than scored, chapped hands.\" Margaret did not scruple to try to the very utmost any false pride and shame which belonged to her set. She had to give to her mother's life what brightness it could still receive, by being maid of all work, morning and evening, and by being at the same time child's maid and nursery governess to Joyce. Margaret was so \" clever at her needle,\" as folk said ; she could so concentrate her mind on her work when she was at it, and thus so flash on it new lights, and hit out in it new strokes ; while her eye for the harmonious and graceful served her in such good stead in mantua-making as in other lines of her career, that she became a favourite and head workwoman with Miss Gill. She was allowed to do what might be called piece-work at her own time, because her own time was always the shortest. So conscientious and ardent was she, and at this period her buoyant constitution could do with so little rest, that it was well known she would sit up a whole night, \u2014 as young ladies will dance the better part of a night, \u2014 sooner than fail in her word or disappoint an employer. The gain of her being thus trusted and allowed to adopt her own methods was that Margaret had occa sionally a little time to herself, which it was the delight of her life to improve. In the first place, she kept in order that wooden house down by the pier, and made Mrs L"], [160, "Enterprise. 146 Copeland and little Joyce quite spruce and natty by her feats. Instead of suffering the surroundings of home to run out and its inmates to become woe-begone, Margaret restored very much of their primitive brightness by her skilful repairs and fresh touches. The old house was not suffered to retrograde and sink into decay. The wine of life was poured afresh into Mrs. Copeland's cup where she sat, no desolate burden, but one of the neatest and most nicely kept of widow ladies, served with the daintiest of cheap luxuries. The same wine bubbled up and sparkled in Joyce's small glass, when the child s wit instinctively recognised herself no neglected waif, but a well cared-for child, respectable and respected among her companions. It was an unqualified treat for the members of the family who were out in the world to return on their visits to so hopeful and cheery a home. And it served as an incentive, bracing and spurring the laggards and loiterers to come back in such a fashion that they should not disgrace the home which Margaret made and preserved for them. In gathering her stores Margaret used to go herself to Greenwich market and carry home her laden basket on her arm; but though the good custom was not yet gone out of fashion with housewives, her mother would be uneasy about it and would object to it. \" It is not a practice for girls, Maggie,\" Mrs. Copeland would argue ; \" indeed, I was never up to chaffering with the market people in all the years of my married life.\" (Mrs. Copeland was apt to speak to her principal bread winner as if the state of marriage had given her an"], [161, "Enterprise. 147 immense elevation ; something that was equivalent to a sort of second sight over her daughter.) \" I don't like you to go abroad at odd hours and into all kinds of company, though we are poor, and you are a very good girl, Maggie.\" \"Thank you heartily, mother dear,\" Margaret was wont to answer, soothingly. \" Of course, I'll not go to the market if you don't wish it, rest assured of that. But there are different seasons for marketing. I go a-market ing of a morning when everybody is wholesomely fresh and sober. Bless you, the market people know I'm in earnest and have neither time nor pence to spare, and as I don't waste their time \u2014 not if I can help it \u2014 or seek to take advantage of them in any way, my property in time and pence is respected also. Nobody is rude or takes liberties with me. I hope I'm not eaten up with conceit, but I shouldn't like to think that my own mother had not as much confidence in me as the market wives have. I could not afford to get nice potatoes and turnips for you \u2014 not nice ones, dear \u2014 or a chicken and sparrow-grass when there are bargains going, and we couldn't stand a treat, not a cherry or a pippin or two for Joyce, if I didn't get to market.\" So Margaret was permitted to continue her marketing among the brown-throated Deptford sailors, and the brick-red-soced Woolwich soldiers, \" the jolly Thames watermen,\" and the homely countrymen and women who knew her for what she was \u2014 an honest young lady. Mar garet valued the privilege above all as a precedent. A check on her freedom was one of Margaret's sorest crosses. t. 2"], [162, "148 Enterprise. It was a weak point in her character that she would have liked to try (although she was not so foolish as to believe that she could succeed) everything that man or woman had attained. There were such things as holidays and half-holidays then as now ; and Margaret, who had not forfeited her birthright, was not without her share, though it was a limited share, of pleasure : she took these holidays, as she did everything, with a keen zest. She did not lose her balance in them either ; for just as she could bridle and saddle her sense of humour in the market, which was as rough as Mrs. Copeland had suspected, so she could bridle and saddle her keen zest in the matter of social enjoyments. There were some games (games were the fashion then) in which Margaret was a famous per former ; some songs, such as \" My face is my fortune,\" of which she was universally allowed to be the best singer. But, whether from that innate shyness of which she had only conquered the outward expression, or from the entire cast of her character, she never liked company so well as work. When out at one of her little Green wich parties she used to smother a yawn as she sat with her hands in the lap of one of those simple yet tasteful gowns which she made for herself. But she never yawned when she was stitching, cooking, or, as happy as a child, weaving spells and fulfilling dreams with her shells and wax. This last enterprise was the most noted, and, in the end, the most successful, exploit of her life. Everybody in the town who had the benefit of Mar-"], [163, "Enterprise. 149 garet Copeland's acquaintance wondered how she could find time for all she did, and was able to sleep, eat, wash, and dress with propriety and becomingness. Yet Margaret had spare half-hours to spend with Mrs. Pettet, who had always admired the slender but sufficient prop of her family \u2014 the young creature to whom the world had been an oyster which she had proved herself fit to open. Mrs. Pettet applauded Margaret's daring. Mrs. Pettet's aspiration was that if ever her Jenny repented her flighty harum-scarum ways, she might follow Margaret at such a distance as that at which a faithful copyist can follow an original genius. Mrs. Pettet had served in high families, and Margaret Copeland, who wished to know everything, liked to set Mrs. Pettet to talk of her old services and the habits and manners of the wonderful quality, widely removed as they were then from Margaret's class. Among the quality of the time there was a rage for a particular description of art and fancy work at which we have learnt to sneer, calling it perverted taste and misdirected enthusiasm. But our unmeasured strictures are neither just nor logical. We are the wise men. no doubt, but we are not the only wise men who have ever lived, as we sometimes go far to imply. Shell grottos, shell-work for fountains, shell candelabra were at that time in high esteem, and so was modelling of fruit and figures in wax. The Duchess of Portland caused the untimely death of three thousand snails (keeping count, and recording it without remorse), that their habitations might afford materials for her grotto. Mrs. Delany. to the admiration of Dean Delany, Swift, and all"], [164, "Enterprise 150 the fine gentlemen virtuoso of the day, dabbled alike in shells, paper (for flowers), silk, cotton, and wools (for greater samplers, chair-covers, aprons, &c, &c). Mrs. Damer approached more closely to art proper, moulding in clay a dog for Horace Walpole, and David Hume's bust for herself. Mrs. Pettet possessed some small specimens of these crafts, which she exhibited with pride and pleasure to so intelligent a critic as Margaret. Not Palissy himself was more bitten by the solitary fragment of eastern china than the young worker was bitten now. Fired by a kindred ambition, Margaret got up at break of day, stole moments from the \" small hours,\" and, without neglecting her duties, \" cribbed \" the most of her holiday time with the greatest content, that she might acquire materials for these magic arts, and make essays in them. Martin Copeland, happening to be at home at this season, laughed and raised his eyebrows at Margaret's passion for shells. \"I'll send home lots \u2014 the shakings of sailors' pockets. I did not think you could care for such trash, but they will put yours to shame, Marget.\" Martin kept his word, and supplied his sister with untold wealth in the exquisite treasures of the Mediterranean and the Pacific \u2014 raw material sufficient to excite the envy of a duchess. When was inventor, explorer, or true artist repulsed and overcome by difficulties ? And Margaret's fire was contagious ; it could not go on blazing in secret, though, had it been possible, she would have liked it so to blaze. Three-fourths of the upper class women of Greenwich"], [165, "Enterprise. 151 were kindled into making similar attempts. They came begging to Mrs. Pettet and Margaret for specimens, and for lessons in shell and wax work. But Margaret led the van still. Acquiescent, placid Mrs. Copeland was posi tively uplifted by the excellence, as men and women thought it then, and the renown of Margaret's achieve ments. That shell casket, for instance, with the shells grouped into tiger lilies, white arums, pink roses, and purple peas was a trophy ! Lady Maria Cavendish offered any money for the casket ; but as Lady Maria's money was not always forthcoming, Margaret sold the casket for twelve pounds to Mr. Annesley, the vicar, who was so fond of china and such like things that he kept a house full of them. The casket was thought a bargain ; but Mr. Annesley got Margaret ever so many orders from shops, and from gentlemen of taste in London. The furor, in its diffusion, was soon exhausted ; but in its centre flame it burnt on steadily with no want of fuel. There was one essential difference between Margaret Copeland and her followers. She was never known to tire of a pursuit and throw it up in a kind of satiety, though she might resign one occupation for another more congenial, as she resigned her dressmaking at this era. By her instrumentality a taste and a trade were established in Greenwich, and she was imperatively called upon to supply the demand for her shell and wax work. There was no probability of the demand failing in her day. It might not have failed even yet, if such a woman as Margaret Copeland had continued to group rainbow-coloured shells and to manipulate wax. So"], [166, "Enterprise. 152 great was the demand at first that she had not only to give up her dressmaking, and employ a deputy house keeper, but was in a fair way of making a fortune. It would be wrong and foolish to say that Margaret did not relish her triumph, or that she had not an honest pride in it as well as a hearty thankfulness for it ; but the triumph did not render her egotistical and hard, as it might have rendered her had she been a smaller woman in heart or mind. In effect, the woman was so much greater than anything she ever did, and so devout in her doings, that she could not be puffed up. Margaret had always owned admirers. Men were not so doltish as to fail to see something in her ; and, after she came out as an acknowledged artist, when the first drawing rooms in her town were thrown open to her talents and attainments, her admirers increased. But in a life so charged with occupations and interests there did not seem time or opportunity for acquaintance to grow into friendship, and friendship to ripen to a more tender seeling. There was a general impression, con firmed by her having early appropriated the chief pro prietorship in her mother and little sister, that Margaret would not marry. She had not time or thought to spare for marriage ; whereas Lizzie Copeland, who had been as great a dawdler as she could well manage to be, was married long ago, and Phillis, the second daughter, who resembled Lizzie, was engaged. Even the younger girls, Anne and Nelly, had their budding \" affairs,\" and lads in connection with these affairs, which would in all likelihood blossom into engagements and marriage."], [167, "Enterprise. 153 And still Margaret remained unattached. There was a certain gallantry, though men themselves were unaware of it, in their thus supplementing the incapability of a household. But the sequel gave the lie to these signs and prognostications. That was a marrying age. Mar garet married while still young. And she married, for love, one of those tall, fair, blue-eyed, serenely-handsome, but yet good and clever men, who might be younger brothers, at a modest distance, of Joseph Addison. There was a similarity of taste in this case of true lovers. Edgar Massey's amateur carving in wood, in which he was apt to shut himself up, unmistakably gave proof of genius. It was in this wood-carving and in Margaret's shell-work that the intercourse between the two naturally took its rise. He came to look at her work and to give her advice, and he solicited her in return to look at his work and to allow him the benefit of her opinion. For a time the couple believed themselves impartial, dis interested critics, and doubtless were so. But in marrying for love Margaret made also, as it were, into the bargain, one of the best marriages in Greenwich. Mr. Massey had been left his own master while yet young, and was a man of independent fortune, gentle birth, and college breeding. He was the possessor by inheritance of a pleasant half-country house on Maize Hill. For all that, it was not reckoned a mesalliance when he married Margaret Copeland, the daughter of a de ceased naval surgeon \u2014 a girl who had been a dressmaker for ten years, and with her own hands had done her mother's household work all the while. If the reader will"], [168, "Enterprise. 154 take the trouble to look back for a generation or two, and enter on statistics, she will find that there was then a much wider, a more wholesomely wide field of marriage, especially where capable women were concerned, for the upper middle classes, than there is at this day. In addition to his other advantages, Edgar Massey was a liberal man. He made such a settlement on Mrs. Copeland (greatly elated at what she held a woman's proper promotion in the person of her Maggie) and on Joyce, that they were no losers by Margaret's fortune, as a professional artist, being thus brought to a conclusion. Margaret would have said this estimate of her husband's merits was insufficient. She loved him dearly, with a passionate, almost pathetic appreciation. She always maintained that there was infinitely more in the quiet, un assuming gentleman than ever came out, even in his wood carving; and she who came so close to him ought to have known him best. When Margaret told Mrs. Pettet of her marriage the old woman was a little halting in her congratulations. \"It is all very fine, and you deserve it, if it be good for you, but your gifts will be clean thrown away. You oughtn't to have married at all, Marget, you who could do so well for yourself; or if you must marry, it ought to have been a poor man whom you could back up and pull through. I cannot fancy you a rich lady, Marget.\" Margaret looked thoughtful and just a little vexed. \" If by a rich lady you mean an idle lady, I cannot fancy that myself, Mrs. Pettet ; however, I need not be that \u2014 not though I were Queen Charlotte. But if you"], [169, "Enterprise. 155 think I am spoilt for being a wife, and must perforce hanker after separate power and excitement, then I trust that you are mistaken, because, among other reasons, your notion is not flattering to artists and working women in general.\" Margaret lived to prove the fallacy of this notion aiso. She went to Mr. Massey's pleasant house, and for twelve years she was happy and conferred happiness there, only working in shell-work and wax after an amateur fashion, as her husband worked in wood. But she did not give up her work entirely on that account. On the contrary, she pursued it for its own sake with considerable fidelity, and with something of the old spirit and success. But she was dependent on her husband, as he desired. She derived dignity, ease, and every comfort from him, not only for herself, but for her mother too ; and Margaret was pleased so to derive them. She would laugh and declare that her friends accused her of growing fat and lazy, but that it was not true. She found enough to do in loving God and loving her neighbour, in looking after Edgar Massey, and in bringing up their children, in minding their house and garden, and in seeing that she did not lose the accomplishments which her husband prized as she prized his wood carvings. She might be stiller, and look a little less keen and eager than she had once looked ; but there could be no doubt that Margaret Massey was a fortunate woman, thoroughly alive to her good fortune, and as she had more leisure for society, she was a more captivating woman, socially, than she had ever been before."], [170, "156 Enterprise. At the end os these twelve years, by a sudden, violent reverse \u2014 the failure of a bank in which Edgar Massey was a partner \u2014 he lost every shilling he had pos sessed. The man staggered, and almost fell under the blow. He had been born to prosperity and was altogether unaccustomed to provide for himself, save out of a full purse. In a moment he was left destitute, with a wife, children, and poor relations. Margaret had an acute sympathy with her husband's sense of utter, irremediable loss. But there came a light to her eye and a glow to her cheek, and she said to him wistfully at the close of the third day after the calamity, when his sense of it was somewhat blunted. \" Edgar, you'll not think it cruel of me, but I cannot be altogether sorry that we have become poor. We can work together, and you will not mind the idea of working for a livelihood after awhile. As to the labour, why I have seen you slave at an oak branch, or a dead pheasant, neither seeking food nor sleep, as if ten times more than bread depended upon it. It will be better for the children to be brought up working men and women, with nothing save their brains and hands to depend upon, than to have a little money on which they could fall back, and which they would magnify into a great deal, until they tried the spending of it. I see what we can do so plainly, and we have no reason to call out, or crave pity. We ought rather to be thankful that the catastrophe has come to people who can help themselves. Nearly svery time that I have been up in London since our Xiarriage I have gone to the curiosity shops just from a"], [171, "Enterprise. 157 love os curiosities, and to see what the trade was doing, and so I know that a brisk trade is still driven. Mrs. Admiral Onslow and Lord Tintern both asked me where one could get, at any price, rock-work approaching to that which is in our wilderness, or wood-work like that of our screen. Yes, Edgar, some of that work is very dear to us ; but you are dearer to me, and I to you, and the children are dearer to both of us. We'll replace the old work with newer and better. Please God, I feel I am good for work these twenty years, and for far better work than I have ever yet done. Oh ! husband, think what it will be to work for you and the little ones, and to have you to work with me, and instruct and encourage me ? That kind old fellow Martin, having once got the process into his dear lumbering head, has always been sending me such loads of beautiful shells, corals, china, birds, butterflies, and beetles, that we might furnish a charming curiosity shop of our own on the spot, and he will send us loads more whenever we like to ask him. We are starting with a stock in trade and ample materials for a larger stock, Edgar.\" Edgar Massey was looking at her with eyes stirred to their depths. \"Yes, I believe there is hope for us and ours, Margaret. It will be worth a mighty loss to work with you, wife. Did you so far misjudge me as to imagine I should be ashamed, and not proud to do it ? Fie upon your judgment ! \u2014 the only thing I ever cried fie upon in you. We'll have each other all to ourselves too, for it will cease to be selfishness to shut out the world \u2014 all save particular friends. And come what may, the old mother"], [172, "158 Enterprise shall not lack. It is the least I can do for her after taking her ' Maggie ' from her \u2014 the greatest treasure that a woman ever gave up, or a man acquired.\" High-spirited and single-hearted as the husband ana wife were, they had up-hill work in commencing to earn their living, and that of those dependent on them, in the second decade of their married life. The incessant strain of application, which was once comparatively easy, now that it had been relaxed, was harder to resume for Margaret ; and for Edgar Massey, who had not undergone it at all, it was more difficult still. Margaret's wants and expectations in her maiden days had been far more modest and far more within her reach. Her aspirations soared indefinitely when they had Edgar Massey and her children for their object, and, if these aspirations were to be fulfilled, they called for correspondingly boundless effort. One trial common to the family was that of having to quit the handsome, rambling house with its picturesque grounds on Maize Hill, beyond Sir John's turretted castle, and not far from Inigo Jones' Cherry Gardens Farm. Here Edgar Massey had been born, and here children had been born to him. To occupy \u2014 instead of this hand some, half-country house \u2014 a shabby, confined house opposite the dull buildings of Queen Elizabeth's Row, in the heart of the town, was a sore trial. But the family were together, and it was home where the members were, for they themselves were far more than house and grounds. Margaret was not made to be beaten in the essentials of victory, and Edgar Massey, though he was more easily"], [173, "Enterprise. 159 hurt and cast down than Margaret, proved even more patient and persevering. In the course of fifteen more years Margaret and her husband had struggled and striven, and had got some of their children enlisted in their undertakings ; for one of their sons was an artist of some distinction, and both of the daughters were singularly tasteful and neat-handed. These girls were the best copyists of the works of foreign fan-painters in the country. And so the Masseys were again a well-to-do family, sheerly by the exercise of their gifts. They were winning as well as prosperous, singularly attractive to many a languid out sider, who looked longingly at the circle of children who had inherited a share of their parents' earnest ness and enthusiasm, and were re-established in the old family house among the artificial rock-work and French fountains, the English roses and acacias on Maize Hill. By a lucky chance, that house had come into the market again, and on the repurchase there hung a tale. Margaret had secretly intended to buy the house with her earnings. She had been instant in her labour of love, and had hoarded for the purpose of offering the old home as a birthday present and surprise to her husband. Edgar Massey had privately promised himself to redeem the house with his winnings, and offer it as a birthday present and surprise to Margaret. The two met by accident at the office of the man of business who conducted the sale. They stared, laughed, twinkled away tears, and clubbed together their purses in the repurchase. It was Margaret's lot, after having been the centre and the main-spring of large families both in her youth and"], [174, "160 Enterprise. her middle age, to be lest very much alone in her last days. Her husband died some time before her, and her fine family married, and settled at such distances that, while she could constantly rejoice in their welfare, she could only occasionally see them and their children. But she did not grow a moping old woman. She was quick and kind \u2014 at once thankful in heart, and brave in spirit \u2014 and to the last she was specially fond of the side walks of art, and of trying her old skill in them. She executed and sent to each of her children, and to the children of her old friends, specimens of her work, to be kept as mementoes of her. It was a pretty sight to see the beautiful old lady (with a candid, capacious brow, crowned by a \" hoary head,\" humorous, penetrating eyes, and a mouth as benevolent as it was in youth, and yet blander), sitting in her close cap and silk shawl, working at the old pretty work with so much of the old zeal and naivete\". When her eyes were too far spent for her to pick up and arrange the tiny shells, and her hands too tremulous and feeble to press and form the wax, she still found refreshment in preserving and embellishing her house and grounds. The acacias had never been brought to so snowy a bloom, or the roses to such crimsons, buffs, and whites, although, according to Mrs. Massey's own will, the place was to be sold after her death. She had not even the inducement of the thought that she was keeping and adorning a home for one of her own children. A forward, foolish interloper who had come into the c:d woman's presence, dishonouring it by the absence of"], [175, "Enterprise. 161 reverence, took it upon him to wonder, in her hearing, why she laid out money on improvements of which neither she nor her kin would reap the benefit, and to ask her if she did not think that it was \u2014 well, a waste of the last sands in a nearly empty hour-glass to employ them in leaving behind her trifling tokens of her small art, rather than in preparing for the great realities of the life ever lasting. Margaret Massey, at the officious rebuke, sat up in her chair and spoke some words which burnt with the fire of her old acts. She wished to know whether a devoutly active life, with continual penitence for continual miserable imperfections, and continual dependence on a great spotless Substitute, was not a better preparation for death than disobeying the Lord in judging one's neigh bour, and in perpetually seeking, through mean doubt and cowardice, to be reconciled to Him who declared Himself already reconciled \u2014 our Father in Heaven ? Being at peace with God and his creation, were not all things lawful ? Was any work which expressed the love of the beautiful, ever so faintly, common and unclean, insignificant and base ? As for the house where Edgar Massey had been born, where she had come a bride, with which her faithful husband had sought a second time to endow her, where her children had been born and where their father had died, and where she would die when her t;me came, it did not matter so much to her that it would pass to strangers. It was right that it should be so, foi her children had built nests of their own, and this old nest, from which the birds were flown, would only be an encum- M"], [176, "162 Enterprise. brance to a younger generation, though they might be willing to bear the encumbrance for her sake and for their father's sake. Was she not to care for the place because strangers were to have it after she was done with it ? That sounded small and grasping. For her part, she should like the strangers to have the best bargain which she could give them. She should be pleased to leave behind her one spot of earth greener and lovelier. Down by St. Alphege's, Edgar Massey's bones lay resting, and there her own bones were to lie beside his ; and for any thing further, she was pleased at having improved and beautified even one little corner of that very world at seeing which, on the morning of its creation, the sons of God had shouted aloud for joy."], [177, "163 V. ORDER. \"Her husband is known in the gates, when he sitteth among the elders of the land.\" \" She looketh well to the ways of her household. \" \" T ET all things be done decently and in order\" is an apostolic injunction. \" Order \" is also to be found in that charge of the Lord's, after He had fed the multitude : \" Gather up the fragments that nothing may be lost.\" Disorder, unpunctuality, absence of method, form the most flagrant sources of waste in bodily and mental strength \u2014 in skill, in learning, and in material of every description. Disorder is at the bottom of the uselessness and the folly of much undisciplined force which is lavishly expended in many directions, serving only to choke the paths, and to deter new workers, by the wrecks which are left behind. Everybody knows that ten times the work can be accomplished by rule and law. One would think that every honest worker, above all every young worker, would carefully study these controlling influences. Not so. It is a notorious fact that some great and good workers have done their day's service in the most M 2"], [178, "164 Order. adverse circumstances, amid the distraction of a constant muddle, and in spite of baffling and counteracting con fusion. Had this only been in the beginning conquered and converted into order, the worker would have been enabled to do double his work with half the trouble and half the worry. Not only is less work done, but life is shortened to great workers, by the huge drain, the incessant leak of disorder. Among you girls, and young women especially, there is an impatience of plan and method, of regularity and repetition. There is a fondness for unauthorised and unexplored tracks, a tendency to impulsive efforts and desultory performances, which has nothing to do with originality and enterprise, and would be very comical if it were not grievous. Is it not written for all poor doers by fits and starts, \" Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel ?\" Many men attribute the peculiar lack of accuracy and application in women to their defective education. There may be truth in this ; for from the instances of able women who have been fully educated, it appears that it is more natural for women to be precise than for men to be exact ; while again, in matters on which women's minds have always been drawn out and cul tivated, it may be seen that women can be scrupulously correct, and, as a body, are more methodical than men. But why should not all men and women be more orderly, even without the severe study of mathe matics ? Good men are agreed that order is an essential property of harrrony, of goodness, of true greatness, nay,"], [179, "Order. 165 that the antithesis to the chaos and Babel of error is the cosmos of God's all-pervading, unbroken law.

Endlessly varied and elaborate in their variations have been the directions laid down for the assertion and main tenance of order in body and estate, in soul and spirit. Grim and grotesque the directions have sometimes been. Godly men have, with reason, connected order intimately with the practices of devotion and prayer. But formulas founded on right principles have not always been far sighted or practical. Still, their constantly recurring apothegm \u2014 to consider and settle as definitely as possible in the morning the duties and engagements of the day, and to review at night the steps which have been gained and the lapses which have been suffered to occur in the programme \u2014 is a reasonable and possible exercise. The system is elastic and capable of being carried into every interest and occupation. Indeed the business, science, or art, which is not so conscientiously under taken and executed, had better be let alone at once both for its own sake and that of the executor. Above all other arts, the art of living well needs this process. George Herbert calls it the dressing and the undressing of the soul ; and to a soul restored to purity \u2014 brave, sweet, and holy, as was George Herbert's soul \u2014 the custom should be, in the main, as natural and refreshing as the dressing and the undressing of the body. The aversion to order and the prevalence of disordei"], [180, "Order. 166 owe their origin largely to two causes. Tire habit of order requires a thorough training, and more than most habits, an early training. Children, in the beginning careless, and allowed to grow up inveterately careless, often remain careless to their dying day, though they are partly conscious of the damaging nature of the defect, and sincerely regret it. Still, they are careless of their carelessness, which fits in with the sensational but slovenly Christianity that people are induced to prefer to the sober, strict-principled Christianity which is lofty in its holiness, and aims at being perfect, as God in Heaven is perfect. There is still another enemy to order. It is a virtue particularly liable to abuse \u2014 a righteousness which, more than other descriptions of righteousness, is apt to degene rate into righteousness over-much. Not a few of us have suffered from fidgetty, dogmatic, over-punctual men and women, and we recoil from the experience. A certain class of idealistic men and women, with beautiful and grand dreams, go farther than recoil from the ordeal \u2014 they revolt at it. With multitudes of girls and women this spurious fashion \u2014 prim, pedantic, hard, and unlovely \u2014 is their only conception of order ; and, while they do not have that inner strength which produces revolt, such order as this is antagonistic to them, offends them, and drives them to the opposite extremity of recklessness and scorn for all rules and ordinances whatever.

Withal she must watch that her precision do not degenerate into rigidity, her perseverance into slavish adherence to habit and custom. But without precision and perseverance she will not make a tithe of the progress which she might have made ; she will not possess a tithe of the peace and satisfaction in her work which she might have possessed. Finally, with every desire to be tolerant and fair, it is beyond denial that the great prompting motive to disorder and confusion is self-indulgence.

On one of the heights in Greenwich Park stands a com plex building. The main part of it is like a dome with curious turrets added to it, and the whole is surmounted by a flag-staff pointing to the sky. That building on the site of good Duke Humphrey's tower of Mirefleur, with its chivalric, medi\u00e6val memories, is as old as the older parts of the great Hospital, and still the purpose of the tower is not served, or its day past. In it \" the fairy tales of science \" have taken the place of old romance, working with a power to which romance never attained, even over its chosen heroes. Europe and the world acknowledge the guidance of that tower, with its finger-post pointing to the heavens, and in a sense submit to it. The ships which have sailed from London Bridge, Deptford and Gravesend, since Drake dropped down the river, and long before Cook weighed anchor, have obeyed the indications given forth from this tower and looked to it for directions as to a guiding star ; for \" the blue sky bends over all \" in God's beneficence, and the stars themselves, which run their courses in that sky, serve as never-failing lighthouses, shedding trails of light across the blank pathway of water.

In the Royal Observatory of Greenwich literal and practical star-gazers, the chief of their high guild in England, have resided and presided ever since the fables of astrology died with other superstitions out of men's heads, from Flamsteed, in the reign of the Merry Monarch, to Airy, in that of good Queen Victoria. There they have sojourned, taking their observations, making their discoveries, noting, night by night, the planetary changes, testing the progress of time and the instruments which measure it. A lofty abstracted life one would think these astronomers must lead; but, it is certain, that what of grand vagueness and everlasting speculation belongs to it, is balanced and corrected by the necessity for absolute accuracy, for the finest calculations, for regularity as unswerving as the strokes of a pendulum, for proven deductions where the field is not as yet solid and abiding, but is intangible ether, set with shifting sparks of fire. The astronomers, royal and plebeian, like Shylock the Jew, are much on the model of other men, after all. If you tickle them they will laugh, if ycu prick them they will bleed ; they love and hate, wage war with pen and ink and paper, though the questions in dispute be excep tionally abstruse ; they marry and rear children, after the same fashion as that of their brethren grubbing in the earth,"], [184, "Order. 170 with their heads for ever declined over ledgers, in mouldy offices, where the light of the sun enters by dust-begrimed and cobwebbed windows, and into the sordid recesses ot which one can hardly believe that the moon and the stars will condescend to look. Among these men \u2014 wise with the craft of the old Chaldeans, but very human, sometimes very simple \u2014 was Dr. Holland. He was a little man \u2014 not handsome, but with a kind of natural elegance about him, although he was of peasant extraction, as if he had derived harmony of pose and motion from the harmony of the spheres. His best feature was his eyes, which were not puckered together, dragged out, or scorched up, but large, lustrous, looking far into the distance. They were vigilant, yet dreaming dreams in their vigils, as if they too were borrowed from the starry sky. He was about fifty years of age, but, sallow and worn as he was, he still looked young, with a half-pathetic, half-glorious youthfulncss, for he was young in the world's ways, and young because of the everlasting youth of knowledge, by right of which an aged philosopher will have more of the fire, the ingenuousness, of youth than a blase, dissipated boy or an exhausted fast young lady can hope to possess. The spirit which was in him over-mastered the body and strained it by an unquenchable hunger and thirst after wisdom, a noble panting of the finite to comprehend the infinite. There was a fascination about Dr. Holland. He walked, as it were, over the heads of men. A peculiar tenderness was felt for him ; when he descended from his mountain summits, and went \u2014 a stumbling stranger \u2014 in"], [185, "Order. 171 beaten, miry paths, there was an inclination to take him by the hand and lead him along in safety and honour. In curious combination with his elegance, Dr. Holland was an absent-minded, almost an awkward man. Only his awkwardness was never ungainly ; it was the awkward ness of a gracious, graceful creature, rapt in other things, and therefore liable to a sort of acquired and factitious awkwardness, which did not sit ill upon him \u2014 nay, was even picturesque, standing out as it did against his innate dignity and refinement. His genius was acknowledged, his reputation esta blished, and he himself so famous, that though born under a cottage roof, and nurtured among kindly gaffers and gammers, he ended by being the sympathetic friend, the cherished correspondent of the Keplers and Le Verriers of his day, and yet it was written of him that he was con demned to struggle with gnawing disappointment. So much was to be done, such heights were to be scaled, and Dr. Holland had done so little after all. The heights were so unattainable to human strength and swiftness. The farthest height, the greatest secret of the universe, baffled the farthest forward of the inquirers, till his day was spent and his place on earth empty, with his heap of data \u2014 in the gathering of which he had toiled for half a century \u2014 lost perhaps, or misinterpreted or misap plied by his successors. Well might Albert Durer's Melancolia sit crowned with poppies \u2014 the flower of oblivion \u2014 and leaning her head on her hand, gaze sadly on lever, screw, and wheel as being unable, in the end, to solve the world's deep problems. This dim dissatisfaction"], [186, "Order. 172 and dash of melancholy did not form the let of Dr. Holland alone. They form part of the inheritance of all great seekers, and an instinctive appreciation of such men's blameless weakness in this respect may lie at the root of that pitying tenderness which is felt by common men for their leaders. In addition, Dr. Holland had held too high an ideal of the acquirements possible in life, even including the gains of friendship and love, notwithstanding that he was a reasonably happy man in his home life and family affections. He was a good husband, and had a good wife, though she was not nearly so popular a woman as Dr. Holland was a man. She was generally regarded as one of those every-day, commonplace women, who are often the portion of distinguished men, serving, if in no other respect, at least to dilute their partner's brilliance. Mrs. Holland was, in person, an altogether insignificant woman. She wore ancient black mode and scoured silks. She might have had beauty in her youth, but while her husband still looked in his prime, she, who was ten years younger, and but an ordinary house wife, had fallen away from rosy plumpness to freckled thinness. Dr. Holland was likewise the kind father of promising children. But notwithstanding, he was some what of an isolated man in his watch-tower, guarding the transits of his planets. In course of time Dr. Holland, in spite of his esteem and affection for his wife, had grown in a degree disunited from her, and in consequence from his children. It was not that wife and children were not his greatest admirers,"], [187, "Order. 173 but that they were not familiar with him in proportion to the nearness of their relation to him, and into this com parative distance there had crept a coldness. It was as if the husband and wife had grown so far out of acquaint ance, and the children had failed to bring them nearer. The man himself was hardly conscious of this fact. His whole life \u2014 bountiful and triumphant as it might have appeared to a more shallow man \u2014 had been to him toned down and shadowed by disappointment, which might have grown upon him, saddening him heavily, even embittering him, had it not been combated by his faith and manliness. As it was, he took it for granted that, as there was failure in everything, there must be failure in domestic relations, and that the terms on which he stood with his wife and children were the only terms possible or proper for them to maintain. Therefore he was almost contented to have the bread on which he sought to be nourished in so intimate and delicate a quarter half a stone. He was incapable of de liberate disloyalty to his wife and children ; he was not even sensible that he was inadvertently disloyal to them. Keen as his perceptions were, there was a limit to their keenness, or, rather, over active here, they were dormant there. Dr. Holland, while yet young, had married one of the most conscientious and quiet-natured of women, who had been reared entirely by women. She had been so engrossed by her anxiety to do her part well as woman and as wife, that she had failed to sympathise with his part as man and husband, or else her sympathy had been"], [188, "Order. 174 so undemonstrative that he had missed seeing and securing it. Her scrupulous exactness, her nervous sinicalness in tire fulfilment of obligations, and her ex aggerated view of the importance of these obligations were constantly condemning her, as falling short of her own rigid standard. This gave Mrs. Holland something of the unpleasantness of a Pharisee, and yet she was neither haughty nor hypocritical. But she had no more than divided interest and attention to spare to her husband's aims and aspirations. Young Mrs. Holland would gently beg to be excused from trying, at the moment he wished, the new fine lens of his telescope because she had to look after the wash or the breadbaking, according to the notable practices of her generation. When she was looking out with him for an eclipse of the moon, or the transit of a satellite of Jupiter, she would get so busy with the stocking she was darning, or the frill she was hemming for him, that she would forget all besides, and omit to ask her turn of inspection, or would even inquire innocently what he alluded to when he burst out into exclamations of wonder and admiration. And withal she was an intelligent though ignorant young woman, and could be instructed and stirred up in her latent enthusiasm when she let her intelligence have fair play. But the intelligence, constrained and cramped as it was, narrowed day by day. The narrowness increased after children were born to her, and she was full of her duties as a mother, as well as of her duties as a wife. It is true, hei heart was fed ; but granting heartily the heart's supremacy,"], [189, "Order. 175 a good woman is not made of heart alone ; and this good woman's mind was starved. Dr. Holland learnt the experience and witnessed the process with half unconfessed surprise and mortification, and \u2014 though he strove sternly against the last manifesta tion \u2014 with a little contempt. In course of years he accepted the situation so far as to believe that he was to blame in expecting anything else. A wife had one sphere, a husband had another. There was no such thing between husband and wife as thorough companionship and entire partnership, with their intimate confidences. He left Thirza to manage the house and the children, and he was thankful that he could trust her thoroughly to fill her place, while he was withdrawn from her to occupy his post, with which she had no call or capacity to meddle. In the same way the children were removed from Dr. Holland in their tasks and amusements. Of course there was an intermediate ground on which they could meet and be friendly all the while that Dr. Holland and his wife and family were comparative strangers to each other. They were well disposed, but each knew only his or her own tongue with no more than a bare smattering of another language, so that they could net, with the best will, hold anything save a slight and stinted intercourse together. Dr. Holland indulged but moderately in any fault finding with his wife and children, or any coveting for them of other qualities than those which they had inherited and developed. His wife was a good woman, better than he deserved ; the boys were fine boys, and he"], [190, "176 Order. was justly proud of them and of the girls, though he had no title to boast of them. If only Thirza had been a shade less prim and precise, and if the children were not quite so tame and decorous \u2014 well, it would be a relief to him. He supposed it was perverse in him to desire these questionable improvements. He did not know, learned man and astronomer royal though he was, that the protest was a revolt of the man's nature against the defects which had cheated him out of his due. But all the time, Thirza's heart, as has been said, was being educated more highly than her head, more highly even than her husband's heart. The woman had her children for her closest associates and dearest friends, while the man, though he had his men friends, was with out entire substitutes for his wife and children. In this advantage there was an unfairness to the man. Be that as it may, through her heart there came gradually enlarge ment and enlightenment to Thirza's intellectually narrow womanhood. She was now an older woman in more than years, and she was no longer content with the position which she and her children occupied in regard to the husband and father, as he was beginning to be content with it. If she had to live her married life over again, she would act in many details differently, though it might be on the same principle. She would be more liberal both to herself and to him, more mindful of essentials than of accessories, more careful of her husband's con fidence than of his comfort. The wheels of wedlock might not have run so smoothly in that case ; there might have been hitches and jolts ; but"], [191, "Order. 177 if there had been deeper love and higher duty on the road where the hitches and jolts occurred, such would have only thrown the occupants of the car more together, and not condemned them to slide apart. However, time had passed, habits were established ; and Thirza Holland, like most quiet, methodical women, was tempted to be the slave of habit. She was shy too, as sensitive in her way as her husband was in his ; and if she had not been haughty in those days when she was pragmatical about trifles, she was certainly humble and backward instead of forward, since she had grown wiser. Dr. Holland was engaged in a momentous observation of a \"clock star.\" There had been a deviation in its course, for which he accounted by an explanation of his own. To verify this, an intent watch of the sky on the nights when the star was visible became imperative. Never had shepherd to keep a more unslumbering eye on his fleecy flock than the moonherd and star-gazer had to keep on the flock made up of golden patins studding the sky. And Dr. Holland was exposed to such an amount of adverse influences of the elements as could not beset a rustic shepherd of the plain. On the whole, he was patient, as a philosopher ought to be, smothering his excitement and keeping it to himself. The custom might not afford relief or be the most healthy for himself, or prove the justest, most generous treatment of his neighbour ; but it had one recommendation, cold as it was : it promoted outward tranquillity, and failed to torment where it had not conferred honour, or imparted knowledge and happiness. It was a period of years now N"], [192, "178 Order. since Thirza had known when Dr. Holland was making one of his great experiments \u2014 measuring this spot on the sun, or analysing that comet's tail. These investigations were made on the sacred ground of the upper floors, among mysterious instruments, some of them self-acting, with audible throbs and restless jars like living creatures, and where nothing short of her own impending decease, or the danger of one of the children, would at last have carried Thirza, unbidden. She aud her sons and daughters inhabited the lower portion of the building. It still commanded a notable view of the domes of the Hospital, the town of Greenwich, the docks, the Isle of Dogs, the thick-set shipping running up to London and down to Gravesend in the distance, on strips and basins of water, varying in colour from grey to green, like the skin of a chameleon. Depending from the building was the hanging green garden. Close to it the world came pressing to learn the world's time by the great observatory dial, and to contemplate one of the three best prospects of the great English river with its freight, the woodland park, and the vast pile of chimney-stalks, walls, gables, church-spires, half revealed through their pall of smoke. To the family rooms, Dr. Holland paid visits at stated intervals, and was always received with great deference, which was not without affectionateness, but the aftec tionateness was curbed and crushed. He was mostly bland, and sometimes he unbent so far as an attempt at playfulness. But commonly he was silent and abstracted ; taking his domestic pleasure very soberly, enduring rather"], [193, "Order. 179 than reciprocating faint touches of familiarity on the part of his household. There was a good deal of the French domestic element in Dr. Holland's intercourse with his family, if it be remembered that he had nothing of Gallic lightness and flexibility, but a large inheritance of English gravity and ponderousness, elegant though he was, both mentally and bodily. There was French polite ness in his elaborate, careful remembrance of Thirza. He attended her to the Hospital and the town festivities, and walked with her and his family on the slopes beneath the chestnut trees, and the few dark Scotch fir trees which, like stragglers from a Cameronian regiment, have broken in upon and diversified the uniform lines of chestnuts and elms, by occupying the sandy ground that descends from the brow of the hill on which the Observa tory is built. In like manner, the Governor in his cocked hat, and his wife in her train, along with their children, were to be seen, of a Sunday afternoon, on parade, followed at a respectful distance by the inferior officers with their wives and families ; while the alleys were bor dered by old salts, holding talk of the Nore, the Baltic, and the Nile, with holiday visitors from town, who nodded and curtseyed, and enjoyed the sight of the upper classes in the park. The fashion was set by George III. and Queen Charlotte, with their princes and princesses, who took a weekly saunter, to delight the eyes of their loyal subjects, on the royal terrace at Windsor. But these social demonstrations were the exceptions in Thirza Holland's lot. Her husband's life of study, pr the separate casts of character in husband and V 2"], [194, "180 Order. wise, had caused that Dr. Holland, with all his gifts and graces, should tend more and more to leading the life of a hermit. Thirza, in her isolated circumstances, was intensely faithful to her husband, training her children to devote themselves to their father at a respectful dis tance ; but her household became a small colony ot hermits within the Observatory \u2014 against the walls ot which the tide of life from all quarters of the country and of the world surged up. The Hollands were as much hermits as if they had filled rocky cells in Syrian deserts. But the minute survey of the clock star was a crisis in Dr. Holland's life, which could not be entirely concealed from his family. If he were to equal Flamsteed and Halley \u2014 in deed, not in fame, for Dr. Holland was guilt less of a feverish craving after fame \u2014 he must apply his whole energies, and take endless precautions to avoid proving unsuccessful at this juncture. Dr. Holland came as usual to drink a four o'clock cup of tea in his wife's drawing-room, not as the introduction, but as the supplement, to his two o'clock dinner. That brown and yellow hung drawing-room was a little dark and a little stuffy, because those fine star-gazing eyes shrank from broad daylight, and the watcher, permanently chilled by the night air, was fain to shiver before the fresh breeze which awakes at dawn and sinks to sleep at sunset. Thus the curtains were always half drawn, and the blinds half down, when Dr. Holland honoured the scene by his august presence. Moreover, young feet and tongues were hushed to \" slipping \" and whispering so soon as the step of the master was heard on the threshold."], [195, "Order. 181 Therefore there was danger of the great man's nodding off to slumber, had he not promptly received what he sought, his fragrant cup sugared and creamed to a nicety. Dr. Holland was in the practice of leaning back in one corner of the settee, as he drank his tea, and making a few languid observations on the weather, on Thirza's having been abroad or having received visitors, on the children's tasks at school or their play in the park. Thirza was in the habit of responding willingly, but with a formality which was growing upon her. On this occasion the conversation was a little varied. \" I have some particular observations \" (he did not stop to tell what observations, or how important they were) \"to make to-night,\" he said. \"Batchelor\" (his assistant) \" has been called oft\" to his father's death-bed without previous warning. I might have the help of Deering \" (another assistant), \"but he is clumsy, writes a bad hand in taking down notes, and the slightest mistake would be fatal to my calculations. I cannot be at the telescope and the desk at one and the same moment. I have thought of bespeaking your services on the emergency, Thirza,\" he proposed anxiously ; \" I observe that you write a clear hand in your recipes and day-books which come across me, and I know you are exact \u2014 for a woman.\" Thirza smiled a little at the idea of Dr. Holland having remarked her writing in her recipes and day-books \u2014 he who could not tell how a dish was cooked or when a house account was paid \u2014 but she acknowledged his compliment. \"I am very much uplifted by your praise of my hand-"], [196, "182 Order. writing, Doctor \" (she addressed him \" Doctor \" in the old fashion). \" Let me see, can I be your clerk to-night ?\" and then Thirza paused, for a rush of set avocations crowded into the martinet mind. This was the appointed evening on which she should write to her sole surviving aunt. As this night fell, she arranged her work-table for the week's work. She had put apart this night for her annual pickling of walnuts. Thirza's character inclined to run in one groove, and she had so long complied with the inclination, that it was a painful wrench for her to be plucked out of this groove, to have her established plans upset, and new and uncalculated duties substituted for these plans. \" If there is any obstacle, never mind,\" exclaimed Dr. Holland, drily, secretly chafing not at his wife's duti fulness, but at her want of sympathy, her equal but not obliging temper. However, Thirza had got time to consider, and had thought better of it. \" I am at your service, Doctor,\" she said, with so much decision, that not only was he surprised at the tone, she was surprised at it herself. \" Thank you, I am glad of that,\" he answered, still a little shortly ; \" for the least accident puts me out in my work. I left a paper lying about some weeks ago, and I find I have lost what I shall never be able to replace.\" She looked up at him quickly, but before she could speak, one of her sons entered the room, as it sounded to her, noisily. She turned immediately. \" Have I not told you, Ned, to let yourself cool down after you are"], [197, "Order. 183 heated \u2014 dismiss that flurry, and not move with a clatter ? Why, how is this ? It is four o'clock and you have not fetched your books to be ready for your tutor, neither has your sister Fanny returned from Mrs. Dyer's. I cannot allow you children to be so careless in your ways.\" \"We are only ten minutes behind time,\" replied the lad, frankly, \" and I see Fankin cutting across the park, mother.\" \" Fanny, not ' Fankin,' since you and she are fast arriving at years of discretion,\" corrected Mrs. Holland, solemnly; \"and I should say walking, not 'cutting,' would be the proper term, if you wish to pay respect to your father and me, by speaking correctly in our presence. Ten minutes are ten minutes ; and I shall desire you to beg Mr. Bartholomew to stay just so many minutes more over your Latin verses. As for Fanny, if she has forgotten her reticule, as I think I can detect she has, she must recross to Mrs. Dyer's and back again, before supper.\" Dr. Holland could not help listening a little discon tentedly. His Thirza was a slave to punctilio of every description. It must be irksome to the children, he thought, as it was to him. Regarding it to-night in his state of restlessness, it seemed to him that he had been dreadfully bored by Thirza's priggishness, that his well-managed house and well brought-up children formed portions of a piece of stiff mechanism. The clock-work routine was galling and wearisome. At this moment, he stretched himself in spirit and gasped longingly for liberty, even to snatch a meal when he was hungry,"], [198, "184 Order. and a draught when he was thirsty, to go out and come in at what hours he pleased, to see the children making havoc with the household gods, racing through the house and roaming through the park and the country at large. He was sufficiently sane to know that the wish was a delusion. He was a gentleman at heart, and it fretted him as much as it fretted Thirza when, through neglect, he sailed in deference to the mistress of his house. He still remembered how proudly her kinsfolk had told him that, in giving her to him, they were not afraid of her, though she was so young. Thirza was likewise so prudent, careful, and kind. She would conduct the government of his house discreetly, his home would be safe in her keeping. He had pledged himself in return to do what he could to promote the success of Thirza's housekeeping. Thirza had not forfeited her kinsfolk's bond for her. More than that, he knew in his secret heart that order was good, was best. He was satisfied that it had saved him treasures of time, strength, and worldly means ; that his good children would yet live to thank their mother, who was their dear friend as well as their mother, for the strictness of her integrity. Only this night the man's nature, in a ferment, rose up against the yoke. Punctually before the hour when the clock star was expected to rise in force, Mrs. Holland joined her husband in his working-room in the observatory. He had had no reason to apprehend that she would be ten minutes too late. It was so long since Thirza had been there with Dr. Holland, that the litter of gun-like"], [199, "Order. 185 telescopes, compasses, and charts, over which she had no control, was strange to her ; and the feeling of being among them with her husband was different from that of having him with her in her drawing-room, where she was mistress and queen. In nursery and kitchen and, to a certain extent, also in the dining-room, she was the presiding genius. But these upper rooms were his territories, though his power there was not absolute, for he grappled on that ground with grand possibilities and infinite laws, as if he stretched a hand, trembling in its reverent daring, to the roots of the world's growth, whose network of extreme twigs alone Thirza's assured hand kept from ravelling. Her calling was a small one matched with his, which humbled while it ennobled him. As for hers, if she could not look above, and beyond it, it must dwarf her. When Thirza had been with Dr. Holland to view his field of the sky long ago, she had always been so divided in heart and spirit, so weighed down with some of her household burdens of children and servants, that the lesson which she might have learnt, had been lost to her. Now she was at least mistress of herself and her work. She knew what she could do. Doubt and fear had vanished largely from her housekeeping horizon, and, though in her very devotion she had narrowed that horizon, still by the uprightness with which she had discharged its functions she had acquired the same fruit ful consciousness that pursued her husband in every branch and stage of his labour \u2014 the consciousness of what she had not been able to do."], [200, "186 Order. The weather was propitiously fine, and the moon, nearly full in the unclouded sky, shone down on the clumps and long rows of trees in the park. It silvered the darkness of the cupolas of the Hospital, glinted on the river, with black lines of masts athwart the path of light, and revealed a new world of beauty. That world was more familiar and more homelike to the spirit of the Doctor than the bright variegated world of day, but he was sensible of the impression produced on Thirza as well as gratified by it. He had begun to discredit her sus ceptibility to such impressions. Now he not only cast his unbelief to the winds, but his own spirit thrilled in unison with hers. The might and the mystery of life was in the night world from which the hum of the great city in the distance had died out, so that the faint chirp and rustle of a wakeful bird could be heard, breaking the silence. The life of the couple standing together there and witnessing the scene, passed before their minds, and especially that in it which belonged equally to both \u2014 their love in its first sweetness. It had not been all which it might have been, but nothing else could have taken its place. Surely it had been after all a mainstay and staff of life to the two, though they had gone their several ways and diverged somewhat from each other since the hour when they had come together. \"The moon looks as it used to do at Barley Lane, Giles,\" said Thirza, falteringly, dropping the \" Doctor,\" and referring to the village in which she had spent her youth and where he had sought and won her."], [201, "Order. 187 \"Should it look anything else than its old self, my wife ?\" demanded he, with a man's attempt at jocularity in all circumstances, but with a deeper meaning under the jocularity. \" I cannot say how that may be, but I am sure I have not seen such a moon since you and I were at Tun bridge,\" continued Thirza. Her sentence reminded him of- the occasion of their visit, the loss of the little baby, which had at the time overwhelmed the father more than the mother, on whose breast no baby lay, so that she had turned and comforted him. The couple had gone for a week's change to Tunbridge Wells, and, in the gentle sadness of their mourning, had been kept apart from the gay company, with no want of words and thoughts between them. Only the husband and wife could not remain permanently at Tunbridge. They were bound to return, the one to his stars and telescopes, the other to her remaining children and housekeeping. Thus the season had slipped out of their hands, and Giles and Thirza Holland had relapsed into their old separate ruts. \"Yet it is the same moon all the while, my dear,\" he pressed, still half jocularly, but with a yearning fondness in the jocularity. \" Giles, I must not make you talk of the moon when you should be looking at your star,\" exclaimed Thirza, starting up. He laughed at this. \" I am always safe with you, but I have not forgotten, I could not forget to-night, of all nights, my star, which is not notified for three minutes"], [202, "Order. 188 yet. I can depend upon her keeping her time as upon you: though ladies are proverbially unpunctual, such has not been my lucky experience. But listen, Thirza.\" He spent the three minutes in explaining to her what he had anticipated this examination of the transit of the clock star might be to him ; and to his gratification, his wife, for the first time, followed him closely with bated breath and unwandering attention ; and, though she was stimulated, she was not shaken. She seated herself at the desk as he took his place at the telescope, heard the announcement of the star's appearance, and from that second to the second of the star's setting, she wrote down every one of his brief communications, without re quiring them to be repeated, not swerving in a single sign, and inscribing each so legibly, that he who ran might read. Dr. Holland rose from the telescope with a damp brow and a lip quivering with eagerness as he sprang like a lad across the room to examine the result. Her hand began only then to tremble, and her lips fell apart as she handed him the paper. Standing with clasped hands and head inclined a little to one side, she waited for his judgment on her work, her thin freckled face flushing up under its delicately fresh lace cap, and looking wonderfully young and pretty again, if he had only had time to remark upon it. He bent his brows as he read, his face grew dark with vexation. She could bear the uncertainty no longer : \" Giles, Giles, have I done anything wrong ? Have I"], [203, "Order. 189 spoiled the work which you intrusted to me?\" and the particular and prim lady actually wrung her hands. \" Not you, not you,\" he groaned ; \" but there is a point which could only be verified by the contents of that paper which I lost weeks ago, and I shall not have another opportunity of replacing it \u2014 for the calculations were made on the last sight of one of the stars which pass out of sight in our sky for long intervals. I shall not have another opportunity, Thirza, for two hundred years.\" In the sharpness of his need for pity, he did not see the ludicrous side of his words, neither did she ; for her face was in a glow of tender triumph. \" Oh ! dear Giles, I am so proud that I can help you at last. In case of such a catastrophe as this, I have had all the torn scraps of paper which were left in your room gathered, sorted, and laid aside, ever since I came here. I went to the drawer after you spoke to me this afternoon, and I found a paper answering in date to that which you have lost,\" she said, drawing a paper from her pocket-book and placing it before his greedy eyes. \" I meant to give it to you so soon as the night's work was done, though I did not guess that the paper was of such moment. Ah ! I am glad now that I have been the careful housekeeper that my dear old aunts taught me to be.\" \" Housekeeper !\" cried hoarsely the inconsistent but sincere man, \" you are a guardian angel ! your creaturely order and care are on the model of the divine order and fidelity.

STRENGTH OF BODY AND MIND. '* She girdeth her loins with strength, and strengtheneth her arms.\" \" Strength and honour are her clothing ; and she shall rejoice in time to come. \" A STRONG mind in a strong body is the distinction of a thoroughly armed man or woman. Bodily delicacy is no longer regarded as a womanly attraction, any more than mental imbecility. Disease has ceased to be courted in order that a factitious element of interesting weakness may be superadded to the charms of a fine woman. Yet, it is a sad truth, that there are girls and women mode rately educated who, like the ladies in times gone by, pinch their waists until they acquire wasp-like propor tions, procure a chalky paleness of complexion by the use of blood poisons, and proceed to obviate the effects of weather, or constitutional coarseness, by stuff ing up the pores of the skin with violet powder. It is somehow regarded as a less objectionable practice to powder than to paint. There are women who, drawing one of their fine lines of demarcation, think there is little harm in beflouring themselves white, while they would consider it stagey and detestable to paint themselves red. But even the last enormity has been"], [206, "Strength of Body and Mind. 192 reached and surpassed. An observer cannot look around in the streets or parks of a capital without witnessing in numerable instances of folly, \u2014 tricks of lacing, stuffing, and dyeing. Still, these do not appear much in modest girls of any class, and not at all, save in scandalous exceptions, in girls of the upper classes. In spite of all the ignorance and the bad tone which exist in the world, its standard of morals, knowledge, and taste has been elevated since the days of Horace Walpole and his crimson-painted, white-leaded beauties, with wooden busks and steel-braced corsets. The laws of nature are now better understood. The laws of proportion in figure, and harmony in tint, are generally acknowledged. In spite of a certain relapse and reaction, it is felt that the girl who compresses her ribs and causes her face to blanch and bloom fixedly, at will, is guilty of a gross violation of good taste as well as a humiliating infringe ment of morality. I do not hesitate to make this assertion, recollecting the while, that the acts of the scum of every class, apt to make itself the most conspicuous, may seem to contradict me. Nay, I make the assertion standing in the full current of that portion of \" light \" literature which is a disgrace to our century and our country, and which would persuade you girls and young women that it is well-nigh a general thing, among people of repute and cultivation, to encounter women made up and touched off to their very eyelids and finger-nails. These dreary extravagances and degrading absurdities are the property of miserable charlatans of the Madame Rachel type, with their half witted dupes, to whom the charms and spells may be left,"], [207, "Strength of Body and Mind. 193 if the law do not come in and destroy the revolting stock in-trade. I say my say once more, fearless of being confuted by the almost universal departures from true art and right reason, which undoubtedly are to be found in the women's dress of the nineteenth century. Everywhere still, not withstanding the just censures which have been delivered against it, there is to be seen in some form or other, on the head of the high-born and high-bred woman, as well as poised less gracefully on the head of the respectable working girl \u2014 the monstrous chignon. Crinolines have been modified, but have not vanished from the relieved view ; in the street trailing skirts are not yet entirely dis placed, while trains work as mischievous entanglement as ever in the drawing-room. But I maintain that, though these fashions may vex the fastidious taste, their very universality proves the comparative absence of evil. They belong to a different category from that of the untransparent deceptions and renovations by which fools are gulled and good men and women unspeakably shocked. I have also to declare to you girls, that my confidence in girlhood and womanhood, and in the improvement of manners, is not shaken by such painful excesses as those of the Grecian bend and the Alexandra limp, which occur, one is thankful to record, but rarely, compared with the far more numerous instances of wasp-like waists, mock golden, or raven hair, and imparted hues \u2014 whether of rose, or lily, or walnut. It would be harsh and cruel to stigmatise all the silly girls who are guilty of these offences as radically o"], [208, "Strength of Body and Mind. 194 vicious ; but few will deny that at least their ideal of personal grace and beauty is utterly perverted. Such girls are chiefly represented by milliners' and dressmakers' apprentices, shop-girls, and the daughters of the humbler tradesmen. These form the division of the community which takes under its special patronage extreme taperness of waist. The ranks are swollen by minor actresses and minor public singers, who are mostly hardened in their distinctive operation of rouging by the mistaken exigencies of their profession. Now, the mass Of dressmakers' girls and shop-women, and even actresses, excepting really good actresses, are in all, save their professional and trade departments, notoriously ignorant and ill-nurtured. But such ignorance and vulgarity were far more widely spread a century ago. The women who, when Richardson and Goldsmith wrote, induced incurable skin disease and deadly ailments by the use of powder and paint, and courted lung and heart affection by aiming despe rately at clipsome waists, were ignorant and more or less vulgar-minded ladies. The women who bring upon themselves the same punishment in the present age are generally ignorant, and more or less vulgar-minded, working girls and members of the corps of great and small theatres. The cure is plain. The ignorance must be removed. As gentle and generous agents in striving to this desirable end, let all praise be given to those women, honourable in every sense, who are striving to raise the lower middle classes, who are seeking to exemplify a more practical Christianity, to furnish homes deserving of the name, and to supply higher pursuits for the dressmaker's apprentice,"], [209, "Strength of Body and Mind. 195 the shop-girl, and the small tradesman's daughter. Would that the movement could extend yet farther ! It would be a great step towards the purification and moral re generation of the theatre if the young actress who is still virtuous were also cared for, and rescued from the false influences which haunt her, \u2014 rescued even from her own levity and boldness. I have said nothing of the light-minded, evil-disposed women of the higher classes, whom no amount of educa tion can educate, whose frivolity and folly are deep-seated and well-nigh inveterate. To them meretricious arts come as naturally as simplicity comes to the honest and true. In this place I can only leave such girls and women hors de combat. But I would fain test my statement, that no woman in this country who deserves to be called good, and who is above the position of an inferior actress or a shop-girl (and many an actress and shop-girl would scorn the thought of the weak attempt), dreams now of violating the well-established laws of health, cleanliness, and pro priety in the treatment of her person. I ask you, my readers \u2014 and I have no dread of affronting you by the question \u2014 how many of you frank, sensible, self-respecting girls ever painted (unless in a game of charades) ? I am afraid some of you may have been silly and vain enough to advance a little way in the pinching of the poor breath out of you, by way of adding to the attraclior. of your figures ; but even this shortsighted process has been under limitation. Still, if you have been guilty of the cruelty of putting the smallest screw to the region of your lungs and heart, let me ask, with how many good o 2"], [210, "Strength of Body and Mind. 196 girls and women were you ever acquainted of whom it could be pronounced positively that they veneered and lacquered their faces ? I call upon you, from your own experience, to give contradiction to the odious lying of the evil light literature of the day, so far as it professes to promulgate its knowledge of English girls and women from other than low and degraded sources. Yet, while the old sins against strength of body are virtually exploded in all regions where light prevails, very many women remain wilfully ignorant of God's clear laws of health, or, if these laws are known, women systematically slight and break them. Nevertheless, the rules are few and simple of which it can be confidently written, that when they are faithfully kept, they go far to promote and restore vigour, to prepare an elastic youth for a robust prime and a green old age. Abundance of air, abundance of exercise, a liberal allowance of plain and nourishing, but if possible not stimulating, food, sufficiency of em ployment and sufficiency of recreation, together with peace of mind \u2014 these are the simple but needful elements to aid the dutiful girl and woman in securing her share of serenity and patience, along with her share of tribulation. Let it be granted that, while all men and women may have peace for the honest asking, the other essentials are not completely within the reach of thousands pent up in cities, dwelling in poor homes, or toiling incessantly for bare bread. Still, there is left at least a large proportion of the upper and middle classes of young women who could have all these good things, these best of natural"], [211, "Strength of Body and Mind. 197 things (all God's best natural gifts being the commonest), for the taking, and who either withhold their hands altogether, or hold them out reluctantly and withdraw them speedily, only half-quarter filled, thus stinting and impoverishing their lives. Girls and women, true and tender, who are obedient in the discharge of every other obligation, will trifle with these sacred laws of health till they have recklessly thrown away the jewel which fonned the foundation stone of their power and usefulness. Day after day, a girl or woman will occupy herself busily, or dawdle loungingly, or make mischief, within doors, forgetful always that it is ordained that for her gain and her enjoyment, if she will but cultivate such enjoy ment, she must go abroad in every variety of season and weather, unless it may be in tempests of rain and snow, against which she cannot defend herself. This is needful that she may flush her lungs with fresh air as the tidal wave flushes the rivers. Her blood will then be made to circulate more freely, and will be purified by motion and change, while her mind may be exercised and enlivened by the contemplation of the primitive perfect beauty of a forest or a mountain, a single dappled cloud, or a fresh blade of graa-i. Her spirit within her, which while it is in a body is seriously affected by the body, may thus, too, have its own sweet delights of exhilaration and strengthening. Girls and women with a sneaking kindness for a sedentary life crazily avoid as much as they can (save in violent reactions which constitute them Amazons of hunting fields) every opportunity of bracing their nerves and muscles by wholesome out-of-doors exercise, such as"], [212, "198 Strength of Body and Mind. may be found in regular long walks, gardening in earnest, botanising, or study of any branch of natural history from the life. Girls and women of fair intelligence are painfully unaware of what is good or bad for them in eating and drinking. With a false shame, they eschew the subject altogether, pooh-poohing and turning their shoulders on questions as to the materials which are calculated to insure and preserve their health and strength ; or else they take up eating and drinking with another end, and pursue them for the purpose of pampering their own and other people's palates. And this not entirely for self-indulgence or gourmandism, but because it is the fashion in certain circles, aping certain higher circles, to be learned in sauces, pickles, wines and liqueurs, as it was the fashion among the old French noblesse, from Louis the Well beloved, and intensely-hated, downwards. In this light it may be affirmed that, while the old bread-and-butter misses, who would not be so gross as to do more than nibble at the substantial beef and mutton which our northern climate demands, were bad, and the trashy pastry and lollipop misses who succeeded them were fully worse, the pas in unwholesome and dangerous pro clivities may be unhesitatingly awarded to the young ladies of sauce, pickle, and wine celebrity. For girls and women to eat with happy, healthy relish, in order to live in health and to the full tale of their days, no very extensive or expensive bill of fare is necessary. But the bill must include beef or mutton, from which saucy eaters, without training, are apt to"], [213, "Strength of Body and Mind. 199 turn in disgust. So far as the dwellers in this foggy island are concerned, it is only in strict subordination to animal food and bread that vegetables and fruit may be taken freely, according to constitutional capacity. Pastry ought to be sparely eaten, and never made one of the principal articles of food. Milk, when it can be had in purity, is a first-rate ally \u2014 greatly preferable to tea, coffee, chocolate, cocoa, and to any form of beer. It is most desirable that, in health, there should be but a very moderate use of all save the lightest wines. Such a diet may be infinitely varied and made to tempt the most dainty ; and the leading principles of cookery in it are, one is pleased to reflect, easily acquired by all women, except the most giddily flighty or densely stupid. Therefore there is little occasion for our better educated girls and women renouncing all their higher pursuits that they may become mere skilled cooks and active housekeepers, like their shrewd and kindly grand mothers. Excellent as these old ladies were in their day, the day has gone by, and a step backwards will not recover their excellence, but only make a poor travesty 3f it. Wisdom is justified of all her children, of women as of men. The good women of the nineteenth century may be different and yet gladly sympathise with the good women of all centuries, with Roman maidens and matrons, back to daughters of Judah, and mothers in Israel. There are certain dyspeptic \u2014 we shall suppose, gloomy literary men who urge upon women this retrograding process. To deal fairly and be consistent, they too ought to retrograde \u2014 but let us come to an understanding"], [214, "Strength of Body aud Mind. 200 with them. Do these litte'rateurs wish to indicate by cookery the correct and careful preparation of fare which must be nutritious, and to be nutritious should combine the good gifts of tastiness and recurring novelty? for these qualities are now recognised as bearing closely, at least, on the act of digestion, and dishes to be really good must be like the best, the highest order of French cookery, piquant and varied. If so, then let the cumbered, depressed man have recourse to some of the clearly written works on animal physiology and to the multifarious and clever cookery books, and unless his opinion of women's intellect is the very lowest held by man out of Turkey, he will admit that these studies are quite within the comprehension of any girl not a downright fool or an arrant dunce. He will admit that, while she cannot learn duty and discipline too soon, though she were to defer the serious consideration of cookery books till she were about to be married, even then an attentive and thoughtful perusal of what was most necessary in the stores of information presented to her, would render her largely familiar with the business of her kitchen. \" Ah ! but,\" moans and snarls our dyspeptic friend, \" this is forming acquaintance with theory ; I demand that my model woman be practical, able to boil a potato and bone a fowl with her own hands. There is nothing like practice. Only a mistress who has had personal experience in cooking can teach a servant experience.

But if you devote our young middle-class women to cookery and housekeeping from their infancy, what if in this non-marrying age they never have a kitchen of their own to superintend, or a house to manage ? At the best, if they do find a field for their powers, what of that higher field of wide sympathy, generous interest, and intelligent appreciation of all that is good and noble which is situated in quarters above and beyond those provided for the satisfaction of animal wants ? Is that unseen, spiritual field, which is after all the better field, to lie barren or be choked with weeds, that the body may be more certain of its comfort \u2014 granted the comfort were certain ? If you would deign to try in your own person one of those experiments in cookery to the daily repetition of which you tell off your women for months and years, as you might require to do were you a soldier in camp or a squatter in the Australian bush, I would venture to say that, if you were only mode rately alert and painstaking, you would be astonished and delighted with your own feats. You would find that the fair practice of cookery does not insist on a long and arduous apprenticeship.\" At the same time it is possible that no bright, handy missus of them all will ever, nowa days, that is, without giving her life to it, attain the entire ease and skill in stirring, tossing, and dishing, which is shown by her heavy, clumsy-looking Betsy Jane. The question is, whether the attainment is worth the expendi ture of a life ? No woman, however experienced, can teach"], [216, "Strength of Body and Mind. 202 experience. As to the German precedent, the Fatherland has stood still in many a habit and custom ; and that is the sole reason why German ladies work more with their hands, but not more or better with their heads, than do English housewives. Simple habits and customs in do mestic life may be best ; but unless our friend is also prepared to return to them in toto \u2014 to wear his dressing gown at table, to be as musical and as easily satisfied and amused as the German house-father \u2014 then he ought not in justice to propose that his women should be changed into sac-similes of German mothers and daughters. But if our dyspeptic antagonist means by cookery, the science of high spicing, of dexterously tickling and pro voking the jaded palate, then in the interest of his own dyspepsia, not to say his moral freedom from the base slavery of gourmandism, I should earnestly recommend that he continue to intrust his cookery to professional cooks, who would be paid in handsome instalments of the current coin of the realm for their elaborate exertions and unremitting toil to an unprofitable end. There are bracing atmospheres and exercises for the mind as well as for the body. These, too, women often grievously neglect and forsake, for the reasons that sloth and self-indulgence steal over us all, and that many false dogmas and influences have also contributed their utmost to enervate women. The education of girls has long been deficient. The emotional part of a woman's nature is often sedulously and solely fostered, or, at the worst, her animal nature is over-excited and drawn out ; while the reasoning faculty is left to pine and dwindle or grow"], [217, "Strength of Body and Mind. 203 distorted. Unquestionably the best training-school for girls and women is affectionate, serious, intelligent inter course with good, thoughtful men of the world ; not worldly men, but men of enlarged knowledge of the world who have maintained their principles and retained their sensibilities. Such intercourse with your fathers, brothers, husbands, and friends, many of you girls and women may have at will, if you will but seek it. Take pains, then, to make yourselves fit for it ; give your sense and wit fair play by thinking and reading on the topics which interest the best men, if you will prize, as next to your chief possession, this strengthening and softening inter course. Such intercourse is not without its gallantry and grace, because these are the gallantry and grace of two thoughtful, kindly human beings, and not the qualities perverted and smitten with folly and madness in the hands of an ape and a jay. But such intercourse is not always to be had. There are women wiser and stronger than the men of their households, who swagger, and lean upon the women. There are households of women who have little familiar intercourse with the world without. Must these women shrink into undeserved insignificance, and give themselves up in despair to weakness and narrowness ? My specially maidenly sisters, you have a specially maidenly grace to me, and whether in youth or in age, I believe there is no more necessity for your becoming visionary and fantastic on the one hand, or hard and prejudiced on the other, than there was a necessity for Jane Austen and Joanna Baillie, with hundreds more like them, growing unreal or"], [218, "Strength of Body arid Mind. 204 irresponsive. But you must be earnest, and, as far as you can, large-minded and large-hearted. Don't confine your reading to devotional reading, to one style of biography, to those novels, however good, which appeal perpetually to the emotions and passions, or to that poetry, admitting it to be high and pure poetry, of which feeling is the staple. All of these prompt to introspection, to incessant and, at last, morbid analysis of the world within and the providence without you \u2014 analysis of your own motives and sensations, and your own and your neigh bours' fates in this world. Try to let yourselves slip out of sight, to project yourselves beyond yourselves, and for this marvel there is no force equal to true godliness, true Christianity. Try to take events in their large significance and sequence, not in the subtle undercurrents of their influence. Seek to be broad, tolerant, hardy, cheerful, and contented \u2014 to take things, in one sense, as you find them, really believing that \" whatever is, is right ;\" \" God is in heaven, all's well on earth.\" Quit books (save one), rather than leave unopened the broad book of nature and human character. Mix, when it is in your power, frankly and trustingly in the equal society of your fellows ; do good to them always, and above all, when you find them poor, ignorant, or suffering. Take a science when you can get one to your mind. If you cannot master it as Mary Somerville has mastered astronomy, you can at least be its humble, happy hand maid.

Do your little devoir as Margaret Copeland did hers \u2014 gallantly, though it were only to contribute to the Watteau side of art. I have kept one class of studies to the last, and for a reason. Odd as my opinion may read to some of you, I count the imposing array of dead and living languages, history, mathematics, metaphysics, the proper machinery of colleges ; and the colleges which supply it I regard as a less sure and safe means of making strong, many sided, healthy men and women than a sensible, active minded improvement of the plainest ordinary education and commonest experience of life. But I would be very far from undervaluing scholarship. I rejoice to hear of colleges, lectures, and examinations for women. Let every woman who has it in her become a scholar, and she will become so much the more an enlightened, cultivated human being ; but do not let her become a pedant ; and this she will be, if she put learning before living, or even the teaching of schools before the teaching of nature. For a similar reason, while I would counsel you girls and women to read (and still more to reflect on) history, biography, essays, and travels, as a means of strengthen ing and informing your minds, I would beg of you to keep in view that these are, at the most, but means to an end, and that the end is not that you should be the old deservedly decried pricieuse or blue-stocking, but that you should be a modest, bright, intelligent woman,"], [220, "206 Strength of Body and Mind. ready in conversation \u2014 for the talent of conversation, if it owes most to mother wit, owes much to reserves ot observation and knowledge, to capabilities of comparison and contrast evoked by familiar acquaintance with kin dred topics and their associations. Especially the gain coveted for you is that you be ready in action. A woman really strong in body and mind will be up and doing whenever she has a call for action, in place of spending her strength in frothy talk and wordy declama tion. There is an antipodes to strength of body and mind which is the keynote to those satires of the day that hold up to public ridicule gushing women, women whose emotions are forward and their understandings backward, women who have no staidness, no reticence, no moderation, who bring a scandal upon earnestness and enthusiasm, because they mistake in themselves, and cause others to mistake in them, the excessive expression of a quality for that quality itself \u2014 extravagance noisy and fantastic for enthusiasm still and deep. THE WOMAN WHO TRAMPLED ON DRAGONS. Judith Thynne's father was a man of independent means. He lived on the edge of Greenwich Park, in one of the straight, stiff brick houses, with light facings and copings, grey wooden screens canopying the windows, and grape-vines and Virginian creepers canopy ing the screens. Mr. Thynne had been an eager searchei after truth in his youth, and he was an independent,"], [221, "Strength of Body and Mind. 207 determined man still. He had travelled more than most of his neighbours, and had been in France just before the great French Revolution. In Paris he was brought into close contact with the mighty dogmas of natural right and common brotherhood , which were then thrilling the hearts of philosophers and philanthropists, and paving the way for the Revolution. Mr. Thynne imagined that he had weighed and sifted these dogmas, and had only brought back to England with him, as part of his creed, what was pure gold in the mingled gold and dross. But his first display of latter-day wisdom was not an entire success. Admiring the pretty young daughter of a Greenwich bargeman, he married her in vindication of his theory of social equality ; and, having little patience with ignorance and helplessness, he soon developed into a kindly tyrant, whilst his wife was little removed from a contented, well-treated slave. Judith was the first daughter born to this couple, in the wake of several boys. After Judith there were more boys, and then more girls wound up the large family. Mr. Thynne had his theory on the rearing and education of women, as on every other question. It was the pre revolution emancipation theory which, in the room of the big sweet babies and artless dolls drawn from convent parlours, matured on the hot-bed of a French soil such women as Madame Roland, Madame de Stael, and the beautiful, pitiful terror, Charlotte Corday. Mr Thynne did not allow his wife the credit or discredit ot bringing up their first daughter. He claimed Judith, as well as her brothers, from her earliest childhood. . With"], [222, "Strength of Body and Mind. 208 her brothers she was educated in classics, mathematics, and, above all, in political economy, by a capable tutor, under Mr. Thynne's eye. He would have sent Judith to college with her brothers, had such colleges admitted women-students in his day. In place of keeping Judith practising her music, or sewing her sampler in the brooding sunshine, or at the utmost taking a short, formal walk with a governess, he took her to walk with him and the boys, as soon as her little legs could keep up with longer legs. In every kind of weather she accompanied them, in disregard of the destruction of her tiny garments. He also encouraged her to join in the boys' games of hare and hounds, ball, shooting with bows and arrows ; her proficiency in play culminating in her youthful promise as a cricketer. Amid all this progress towards forming an Amazon, Mrs. Thynne did not interfere with misgivings. No doubt she wished that Mr. Thynne would let her have Judith, or at least suffer their girl to grow up delicate, and prettily behaved, like other girls of her position. Mrs. Thynne, subdued in her good fortune, and never at ease in her happiness, looked on with covert envy at the mothers of such girls. But she never dreamt of going farther than a longing wish. Little Judith liked her father's tactics very well, though she would cry when her Greek lesson was hard, or when her limbs ached with the vigour of some of her sports. By-and-by, Judith, beginning to get young-lady-like, and to consort with other girls of her own age, ceased to approve of her father's system. She was abashed at"], [223, "Strength of Body aud Mind. 209 differing from other girls, and craved to lay aside for the rest of her life all the learning and muscular development in which she was superior to them. If only her mother (Mr. Thynne had not suffered even baby Judith to lisp \" mamma \") would claim her right, and take Judith in charge as mothers took charge of their daughters ! Then, she was vexed that her mother was not like other girls' mothers. For Mrs. Thynne had never learned to play the spinnet or the guitar, to read execrable French, or to work on catgut. She could not so much as whip a syllabub ! She was only good for coarse hemming, to gather fruit and vegetables in their season, or sit and doze with her clumsy hands in her lap. If any one would only be so good as to get ill, and let Mrs. Thynne have the opportunity to pet and coddle him or her ! So long as there was a baby it was a perfect God send to Mrs. Thynne, whose time hung heavily on her hands. As to Judith, she was fairly clever, with a great amount of sensibility, which might prove her stumbling block and scourge. Mr. Thynne was acute enough to observe Judith's girlish restiveness under his yoke ; but he did not speak of it. He had decided that she should wear the yoke, and he did not waver in his decision. As a full-grown woman, Judith had become more than reconciled to her father's sway and her mother's sub mission. She was pleased to acknowledge now, that she owed to her father's maintenance of his views her singularly capable body and mind, and her power of congenial companionship with her father ana her p"], [224, "Strength of Body and Mind. 210 brothers in all their pursuits when they were at home. Nay, her influence over the younger members of the somily, and the success with which she could deny and restrain herself, she now perceived were due to this cause. Even her large capacity of enjoyment had grown out of it. A strong nature takes kindly to cherishing a weaker nature. It is not to be wondered at that Judith's affection and care for her mother quickly grew. She could no longer wish that her mother were other than she was. Judith now laughed at the notion that a foolish, un grateful girl had ever blushed and fretted because the dearest, most homely mother in the world had never wasted her time thrumming on guitar strings or tugging at worsted and catgut. Judith was above such nonsense. But she was not at all supercilious and insolent ; for these qualities belong essentially to littleness and meanness however they may be disguised. Hers was not a small soul, and her faculties had not been frittered away on little objects. She had her father's kindness and liberality, dashed with her mother's sensibility. Her education had been so far excellent that it had taught her self-mastery and self restraint. Still she was intolerant of smallness wherever she met it, and was inclined to be disdainful now on the question of being peculiar. While she continued secretly sore on being condemned to stand aloof from the ranks of other girls, she was tempted, too, against her better judgment, to make a vaunt and challenge of that standing alone."], [225, "Strength of Body and Mind. 211 There was a still graver evil in Judith's education. While it was professedly Christian, it had a tendency to preach original virtue, and a self-reliance verging on audacity. Thus it finally struck at the root of the Christian religion in practically denying its necessity and the call and work of its founder. An old Methodist across whose path Judith came, dubbed the girl \" a fine unconscious young heathen,\" and the definition was not unjust. In physique Judith was a splendid girl. Yet she was not splendidly beautiful. Her features were too irregular; but everything that could be made of the original face and figure had been made of them. The whole person was knit, set, tinted to the utmost degree of good of which it was possible. The hair was of mouse colour ; but never was seen such hair for luxuriance and flexibility elsewhere than on the head of a woman who works with her head uncovered in the open air. The eyes were nondescript as to colour, but never were eyes clearer, better opened. A critic did not mind the bluntness of the nose, or the slight projection of the upper jaw, or the breadth of the lower portion of the face. The greater breadth of the forehead, the plump roundness of the contour, the sunny ripeness of the cheeks and the lips, and the whiteness of the slightly prominent teeth amply made up for these defects. In the same way the chest was expanded without the employment of a chest expander, and the bust was fine. The shoulders were at the proper altitude ; the arms were firm and lithe, and hung to a hair's breadth ; the hands were neither large P 2"], [226, "Strength of Body and Mind. 212 and shapeless, nor meagre and pinched, but cleanly cut pointed, dimpled \u2014 not too white and not too pink. They were hands which could sustain a burden as well as grasp a support, gifted alike with character and capacity. The waist was the waist of a Grecian statue, or of a working woman who has not sinned against her body by copying the follies of her fine lady sisters ; while the feet were like the hands \u2014 not Chinese feet, but very well turned and expressive. Judith was fond of morning gowns which fitted but did not cumber her, and in which she could go out of doors with merely the addition of a hat, scarf, and gloves. In winter she used to wear pelisses of cloth ; and in summer of nankin or some other washing stuff. In the evening she always wore the very simplest of made and trimmed gowns, whether of blue silk \u2014 for she had a great par tiality for blue \u2014 or clear starched muslin with blue girdles. More than most girls, she dispensed with trinkets and chains, necklaces, buckles, and bracelets. The only adjunct she would have to her gown was a little crape or silk neckerchief, generally blue, which she knotted round her throat. This would enable her to stand at an open window, or to go out on the balcony without the risk of catching sore throat \u2014 the single form of cold to which she was liable. \"Judith,\" said Mr. Thynne to his daughter, one boisterous autumn afternoon, taking her aside after dinner, which he had eaten silently, \" I am hoiribly afraid an accident has happened to Mr. Whyte next door.\""], [227, "Strength of Body and Mind. 213 \" Oh, dear ! why?\" cried Judith. \" Tom Merrick tells me that Whyte went out this morning in his boat, accompanied by a strange young man ; and they have not returned. It is dirty weather, and both the waves and the tide are running high, and knocking about the shipping in the river by this time. Of course Whyte's boat may have put in at some other landing-place ; but Mrs. Whyte does not think so, for she has been down at the pier, like a ghost, looking out at the driving rack, a dozen times this afternoon.\" \" What are you to do, father ?\" inquired Judith, directly. \" That is just what I cannot tell,\" he answered, in perplexity. \" One does not like to meddle, and there is a plaguey mystery about these people. Such queer reports with regard to them are flying about, that one cannot come bound beforehand for the consequences of raising the town, on an expedition of Whyte's. But I cannot bear to think of that poor woman sitting in terrible suspense all alone next door to fellow-creatures. The last time she was down at the pier, she told the watermen that it was her brother who was with her husband, and she said it was on account of the lad she feared most. Whyte himself was an experienced boat man, and could run for shelter anywhere ; but the other might embarrass him.\" \"Could that be?\" \" Well, if all tales be true, WTiyte has plenty of com rades down on the coast, and knows enough of craft of all kinds, to warrant him in letting his boat drop down with the tide, taking the chance of being picked up by"], [228, "Strength os Ifody and Mind. 214 some lugger or other. But the presence of a stranger, il he be not of the same set, may have tied up Whyte's hands and seriously interfered with his man\u0153uvres. But all that is no business of ours ; what I want is that you should get a shawl and step down to the pier with me, and try if we can learn anything more definite of the fate of the boat.\" \" And then, father ?\" suggested Judith. \" Then, if the worst is apprehended, you may surely go in and offer to sit five minutes with the woman, whom you know very well by sight, to lighten her watch,\" put in Mr. Thynne, in insidious parenthesis. \" I should send your mother, but she would only shake like a leaf and gasp in the other woman's face.\" \"And it's possible I may not do more, and perhaps Mrs. Whyte will not like my going in,\" Judith remon strated. \" Try her,\" responded Mr. Thynne. \" At the worst she will not take a bite of you ; and if anything is wrong the wife must be the least to blame.\" There was a strong suspicion in Greenwich that there was something wrong with the Whytes. Few suspected families came so far up the river as Greenwich. They came occasionally to Gravesend, and more frequently still to Deal, Dover, or Rye. Their purpose was to act as scouts, and they tried hard to disarm suspicion. From London itself down to the open sea no place could boast itself certainly free from them. Mr. Whyte belonged to no profession, and the domestic reputation of the family <vas not of the highest. It was known that he drank and"], [229, "Strength of Body and Mind. 215 slept alternately for several days in succession. The servants \u2014 the worst in the place, who came and went in rapid shifts \u2014 reported the prodigal waste, and the reck less practices of the couple. Even open windows be trayed violent rows ; and it did not make matters much better that the rows were sometimes succeeded by equally violent demonstrations of affection. Then Mrs. Whyte, decked in a new and extravagant silk or satin gown, and loaded with gold chains and trinkets, would sit in the same window with Mr. Whyte in blue coat and white waistcoat, and wearing a huge signet ring. Thus they would scandalize retiring people by the spectacle of Mrs. Whyte leaning on Mr. Whyte's shoulder, or Mr. Whyte chucking Mrs. \"Whyte under the chin. Judith shrank from coming in familiar contact with the tawdry beauty \u2014 half fool, half virago \u2014 next door. Mrs. Whyte might be more innocent than her husband, as to active smuggling, but she was anything rather than a desirable associate for Judith. This opening to visiting terms, supposing that Mr. Whyte turned up and affairs went on as before, might entail a highly inconvenient acquaintance. Judith was touchy, almost without know ing it, on the subject of her associates. She had per suaded herself, in her wounded pride, that she did not care for being suffered to stand alone among the Greenwich girls of her station, seeing that she could not be snubbed by them. She was the daughter of as blameless a woman as ever lived in Greenwich, though Mis. Thynne had been humbly born and her exaltation"], [230, "216 Strength of Body and Mind. had put an extinguisher on what small brightness she had possessed. Judith's father was an eccentric gen tleman who had stooped in marrying, and had brought up his eldest daughter in what was judged a masculine fashion, so that she knew Greek and Latin, read more than the births, marriages, and deaths, the accidents and offences in the newspapers, and faced as bleak blustering weather as the gentlemen of the town in taking as regular and longer walks. Altogether, she was largely disqualified from entering with good grace into the feeble qualms and quavers, the peddling and fussy occupations which the women who engaged in them called work. She had no relish for the infinitesimal chatter, the maudlin fondnesses, and the spiteful hatreds of the ordinary young girls in her rank in Greenwich ; and on those combined counts the young girls fought shy of her. But Judith held up her head, and told herself that she did not mind being a solitary girl among girls \u2014 that was a small price to pay for her advantages. She had her little sisters, though they were too young yet to be her com panions ; and she had her mother ; albeit Mrs. Thynne was more like a nurse than a mother. She had, too, her father, who was, to be sure, almost as solitary among the blunt naval officers, and dogmatic, timid clergymen of Green wich, as she herself was amongst the women. She had also her elder brothers, when they were at home from barracks and ships \u2014 from the Temple and the hospitals in London ; and her younger brothers when they had school holidays. And she had the true instinct which"], [231, "Strength of Body and Mind. 217 enabled her to settle the question within herself, that il the cream of the Greenwich womankind would have none of her, she was better without the scum. It was due to herself \u2014 to her mother \u2014 to Mr. Thynne's principles, that she should vindicate herself from any disparagement. Accordingly, no girl in Greenwich had been so discreet in her behaviour as Judith, or so careful in the selection of her few friends. Yet here was Judith's father asking her to call and sit with this exceptionable Mrs. Whyte. And Judith did not see how she could help doing so ; for, though her father had accustomed her to give her opinion at all times, and had freely permitted her to differ from him on many points, she never dreamt of disobeying an express desire of his. Again, if her next-door neighbour was in sore trouble, she ought to do what she could to give succour, even if that neighbour was not exactly what she should be. Judith believed the flighty woman would be very dependent on any support, if her husband's support, such as it was, were withdrawn from her. She must let what might come of the deed, even though the sequel shou'd be the mortification of having it tattled over Greenwich, within the week, that Judith Thynne, with her learned books and her masculine propensities, was reduced to making friends with \" that Mrs. Whyte.\" Judith did not mind wrapping a cloak round her, and running down to the pier with her father, though the wild afternoon was waning to evening. She liked that part of the programme. She had already been out with her httie sisters, tempting them, by her example, to do battle"], [232, "Strength of Body and Mind. 218 with the wind on the open heath ; marvelling why everybody who had health did not relish the rousing contest. She had come in and refreshed herself by change of dress, and had proceeded to amuse her mother by detailing to her minutely the aspect of the river ; for Mrs. Thynne, a waterman's daughter, liked to hear how many barges were out and in, with the details of the cargoes ; and what government ship was reefing sails and lying-to in the distance. Finally, she had read Lucy Aikin's contribution to that year's ' Annual Register,' and a page or two of her old Homer. Now it was an experience worth undergoing in the gloom, to stand holding her father's arm, but keeping her feet as well as he did on the pier, which felt as if it rocked under them, among the little crowd of men's spensers, and blue jackets of all grades, with their wearers vociferating, sparring, and staring out at the churned, seething water ; while the masts of larger barges, sloops, yachts, swayed to and fro in threatening proximity. \" Any news of Whyte's boat, Tom Merrick ?\" asked Mr. Thynne, who was looked upon as an enthusiast and a schemer, and did not receive much attention from the practical men. \" Ay, ay, sir,\" said Tom, throwing the words over his shoulder ; \" and there has been rare mischief. She was sighted, after I see'd you, a-keeping company\u2014 empty, mind you, sir, empty \u2014 and towed along in the swell by an outlandish build of a brig, to which the revenue cutter gave chase, but the wind chopped round, and the brig did for the cutter \u2014 got right away. More's the pity"], [233, "Strength of Body and Mind. 219 that rogues should beat honest men. And here is Whyte's boat \u2014 he do be a first-rate steerer, and no mistake \u2014 a-coming in as cocky as if we were all blind, and her master had got nothink whatsoever to do with a brig, or a chase, or anythink.\" \" It is a mercy, anyhow, the fellow is not drowned,\" rejoined Mr. Thynne. Then he turned to his daughter, and said, \" I think we'll go home, Judith, and leave a word in passing to tell his wife that the bad lot of a husband is safe yet. How far he has been tracked and detected this turn in carrying tidings to some smuggling crew is another piece of news, which may be left to tell itself.\" But the drama of the afternoon was not quite ended. Mr. Whyte did not come home with the cool swagger which Tom Merrick had anticipated, and Mrs. Whyte's brother, who had gone out in the boat in the morning, lay disabled and apparently insensible across the planks, while his place was supplied by a stranger of the roughest seafaring class, whom Mr. Whyte had shipped in the course of his row. \" For the love of God some of you men help us !\" shouted Whyte, turning his white face up to the pier. He was flurried and agitated, but at the same time sober and subdued enough ; and, in the teeth of every suspicion and prejudice, plenty of stout arms threw ropes and drew in and secured the boat. \" My brother-in-law has met with an accident, and must be carried up to my house,\" explained Whyte ; \" there is no time to be lost.\""], [234, "Strength of Body and Mind. 220 \" Certainly not,\" Mr. Thynne agreed, promptly step ping forward, when the remaining listeners began to show symptoms of drawing back. \"Your wife ought to be prepared and a doctor had in immediately. My daughter will tell your wife. Here, Tom Merrick, walk up with Miss Thynne, and I'll fetch a doctor.\" Mr. Whyte nodded his thanks. He was either sullen, or careless, or too much engrossed to acknowledge further the neighbourly kindness which, withheld from him till now, was not wanting in his strait. \" Travelled Thynne \" would always be burning his fingers, rescuing his neighbour's goods from the fire. Fine sentiments those of universal brotherhood, but look how they had worked over the water. What although this flashy accomplice of smugglers went out in a storm ; made a mess of one of his unlawful transactions ; had his brother-in-law slip his foot and get a knock on the head with an oar, serve him \u2014 serve the whole disreputable party right ! This was not an accident which officers of his Majesty's service and retired gentlemen of Greenwich could be called upon to repair. Since the scoundrels were beyond the risk of drowning they would come-to soon enough. Thus the magnates of the gathering on the pier melted and vanished ; while Mr. Whyte was in such haste to get himself and his brother-in-law under shelter, that the common bargemen and street waifs who were assisting in the transport had to cry a halt and protest that their leader would have the breath jolted out of the wounded man's body. Judith had obeyed her father's injunction, and walked"], [235, "Strength of Body and Mind. 221 back, escorted by Tom Merrick, to the door next hei own. Knocking an ill-assured knock, one of Mr. Whyte's peripatetic servants flung the door wide open. Soon was heard a rush by Mrs. Whyte, the rest of the household being out under the plea of looking for master. The revelation of that glimpse was even worse than Judith had apprehended. The house was disorderly, stuffed with costly, unmatched, and inappropriate fine furniture ; there was no management anywhere. Remnants of the three or four last wasteful meals, lying about in trays and in dabbled plates and glasses, were strewn in various direc tions. Nor was there any attempt at decent self-restraint on the part of the mistress. The golden braids of her hair hung about her ears, and her skirt was still draggled with the mud she had got on her journey to and from the pier, as she ran, screaming at the pitch of her voice \u2014 \" Has Whyte been taken ? Has Cyril been seized in Whyte's company ? Have both of them been fighting, and killed \u2014 dead ? Oh ! how could they do it, and take no thought of me ? I have been nigh beside myself, I can assure you, Miss Thynne, for I know you very well, having looked at you, and had all your pelisses and hats by heart, for weeks and months.\" In the middle of this irrelevant conclusion, Mrs. Whyte clutched and clung to Judith. Strong as the latter was, she believed her arms would be pinched black and blue, and her whole body pulled to the ground, before she could free herself from Mrs. Whyte, who happened to be an overgrown, biowsily fair beauty, quite as tall as Judith. Even after Mrs. Whyte's worst fears were set at rest,"], [236, "Strength of Body and Mind. 222 and the arrival of her husband with her injured brother imperatively demanded calmness, Mrs. Whyte, to Judith's pain and disgust, continued as full of her own suffer ings as ever. She was fainting, dying of the suspense and the shock. She must have her drops \u2014 brandy ! She should drop down at the sight of blood \u2014 she could not hold a candle \u2014 she did not know what a bandage was made of, or where linen was to be found \u2014 it was in some of the drawers, she daresaid ; but she had been obliged to lock them, for these vile wretches of servants' pilfering, and she believed the keys were lost. When Mrs. Whyte had followed her husband into another room, she seemed to recover strength to accuse and taunt him \u2014 always at the pitch of her voice. He had destroyed her brother. He had decoyed Cyril into a wicked hole of a smuggling vessel. He had meant to entrap the poor fellow, who had come down with the intent of taking her away to peace and safely, if possible. But there was no more peace for her in this world : she had been an instrument in murdering her darling brother. It was no accident. Why, Whyte had wanted Cyril put out of the road in one way or another. For some time Mr. Whyte submitted to defend him self in low mutterings. But at last he could bear no more, and he too raised his voice in loud recrimination, till its harsh accents were equally audible to the un willing assistant and auditor. \" Have done with that horrid chaff, Clary, when I'm hard enough pressed with out your folly into the bargain, I can tell you. Look here, if you care to be with me, and to spend the money"], [237, "Strength of Body and Mind. 223 in my purse \" \u2014 the rest of the sentence sank into a hoarse whisper. It was impossible that Mr. Thynne and Judith could go home till the doctor, whom Mr. Thynne had brought, had finished his examination of the patient, and instituted some rule by which his directions might have some small chance of being attended to. Mr. Thynne, who had acquired a smattering of medicine as well as of other things in Paris, had to act as the doctor's assistant. Judith had to stimulate the incapable maids to procure necessaries, and to listen and try to fulfil orders. The doctor did not think very badly of the young man's state : he had been stunned by a fall, in which his head had been cut, and he had only partially recovered from the stupor. Mr. Thynne confided to Judith, when the two got away, that it was a relief to him to find that Dr. Chapman's opinion confirmed Mr. Whyte's account. There was no evidence to prove that the young man had sustained anything worse than a fall, in which his head might have come in contact with the edge of a seat, or the end of an oar. Very likely the accident had happened in the confusion of quitting the strange brig, and returning to the boat during the chase. Judging from the young man's complexion he was a landsman, and not accus tomed to seafaring pursuits as Whyte was. \" From what all the house heard of Mr. and Mrs. Whyte's domestic confidences,\" supplemented Judith, \" I should say that this young man is comparatively innocent of offending against the law, and has got what"], [238, "Strength of Body and Mind. 224 your Scotch friend, Mr. Dryburgh, calls 'the Tedder's lick.' But these good folks may settle their quarrels as they please, without any farther intervention on our part, may they not, father ? I, for one, hope that we may have nothing more to do with them !\" exclaimed Judith fervently. \"They won't take a bite of you, child,\" repeated her father abstractedly. The next morning all Greenwich rang with the end of the Whytes. It might be striking as an instance of want of natural seeling, but it was not otherwise unprecedented in the circumstances. When the first sleepy servant of the Whytes got up late after the excitement of the previous night, she found that her master and mistress had made a moonlight flitting, leaving Cyril Gale disabled from the effects of his accident, to the tender mercies of strangers. Mr. and Mrs. Whyte, carrying with them those of their valuables which were portable, had slipped out in the early morning, walked unobserved to the next landing-place, and taken boat for \u2014 -none save themselves knew where. The next step was for the good-for-nothing servants to follow their master and mistress's example with what spoil they could secure. A visit of the officers of the law was clearly impending. The officers of the law arrived duly in the course of the day. But another visitor came before them, to the great comfort of Mr. Thynne, who in his character of burn ing his fingers in saving other people's goods, was fain to consult with the doctor on what was to be done with the"], [239, "Strength of Body and Mind. 225 young man, who was as yet unaware of his having been deserted. This first-comer was an elderly, London city gentleman, round, rosy, and dapper, in gold chain, super fine broad-cloth, and neat knee-breeches. He fraternised immediately with the other two elderly gentlemen, and showed himself devoutly thankful to have such trust worthy coadjutors, even though they were in no way responsible performers in the drama. The stranger at once admitted that Mr. Whyte was a flash adventurer engaged in illicit trade ; but he added, in explanation of his own interest in the matter, that a Miss Gale, an orphan who had inherited a small fortune, had met Mr. Whyte at Ranelagh, had run away with and married him. Her younger brother, who was still the city man's ward, had repeatedly tried to interfere in order to save the wreck of his sister's fortune, and to induce her to withdraw from Whyte unless he gave up his desperate enterprises. The guardian pledged him self that this was Mr. Cyril Gale's sole connection with Whyte and his entanglements. Mr. Cyril had gone down to Greenwich with the laudable intention of making a last attempt to rescue his sister from the exposure and catastrophe which would eventually come. The guardian, discovering the young gentleman's errand, and fearing that he might be duped and compromised, had followed, but too late, as it proved, to save his charge from falling among thieves. The man of the city wound up with a little peroration and a bow. As it had happened, Mr. Cyril might have fared worse, for he might have missed the second part of the parable, the 0"], [240, "226 Strength of Body and Mind. meeting with the Good Samaritan. The listeners were left to draw their own conclusion. Whyte had doubtless taken his brother-in-law out in his boat with no particular intention of good to himself, or harm to the other, unless it might be to render the inevitable sharp discussion more private, by tackling the landsman with the difficulties of the situation, so as to silence some of his great guns of indignation. An unforeseen encounter, and the rising of the storm, had in all likelihood produced the disastrous consequences which had ensued. The guardian was prepared to account to the officers for Mr. Cyril Gale's temporary association with Mr. Whyte, and to answer for his ward's innocence. When the officers appeared they accepted the explanation, having an assurance that the city man had some weight on 'Change, and being eager to pursue their real prey. It remained to be settled what was to be done with the young man, who was a passive burden on his friends' hands. This proved a more difficult question to solve. His guardian would have taken him at once back with him to London, where his own presence as a man of business was indispensable, but the doctor forbade the sick man's immediate removal. The doctor also strongly .-rdvised that the galling news of Mr. Cyril Gale's sister's flight with her husband, and their abandonment of her brother in the precarious condition to which he had been brought for her sake, should be broken to the young man gradually. Young Mr. Gale could not remain to have his wounds healed in a house vacant save for him ; but there was Mr. Thynne's house next door, and to"], [241, "Strength of Body and Mind. 227 Mr. Thynne there was no alternative but to throw his house open to the forlorn stranger, in whose name the guardian closed gratefully with the offered hospitality. But after a night had passed, and the doctor had visited the young man in his new quarters, Mr. Thynne came from a conference with the doctor looking very troubled. \" No, he is not doing very well,\" he replied to a question from Judith. \" Chapman observed a degree of fever setting in last night \u2014 don't jump, ma'am\" \u2014 Mr. Thynne could not resist being polite and satirical to his wife \u2014 \" the young fellow isn't going to die just yet, at least I hope not ; that is not what I am anxious about. Well, there is no use in concealing it, as steps must be taken immediately. This Gale must have come down with the infection hanging about him ; there is no mistaking that he is in for small-pox.\" In these days small-pox had lost some of its horrors, but only some. Mr. Thynne was a believer in the virtue of inoculation. He had caused himself to be inoculated, going into quarantine while he was undergoing a mild form of the disease. Those of his family who had attained such age as qualified them to make the choice, he had invited to be inoculated also. Had Mr. Thynne made the acquaintance of a young physician at Berkeley in Gloucestershire, he would no doubt have substituted vaccination for inoculation, and included his whole family in the use of the antidote. As it was, he had refrained from imposing inoculation on his younger children and on his shrinking wife, who would have tottered forward Q 2"], [242, "Strength of Body and Mind. 228 and laid her head on the block at his mandate. Onh. Judith and the elder sons of the family had consented tc submit themselves to a mitigated type of the disease. They had been shut up together, and waited on by their father and one of the servants, whose face \u2014 honey combed in bearing the full brunt of the malady \u2014 had never been a source of promotion to her before. The sister and brothers had passed through the ordeal with out serious suffering or injury. Being light-hearted young people, they went through it not only with hearty thankfulness, but with a merry time among themselves. Thenceforward, so far as small-pox was concerned, they were like Achilles, all but invulnerable. But it was with a thrill of reluctance and a pang of repugnance that Judith anticipated being left to hear, if not to see, all the stages of the disease in its original loathsomeness ; and that, too, in the case of a strange young man cast upon the household by the defalcation of his natural protectors \u2014 reprobates like the Whytes. Yet Judith only said, \" Father, you and I must stay on together in the house with the sick gentleman, and keep Patty Gardiner with us, while we send my mother and the children away.\" Judith might have added, \" and the entire inhabitants of Greenwich, with the exception of Dr. Chapman ;\" for, so far as the public were concerned, not a soul would come near the Thynnes for many weeks to come. Mrs. Thynne shook in every limb. She remembered what shrouds and coffin splinters she had seen in the"], [243, "Strength of Body and Mind. 229 candles and fires for months and years past ; and then became almost forgetful of omens in standing up for her rights and, for the first time in her life, contradicting her husband and Judith, when she heard their proposal. What, provide for her own health and ease, and leave Mr. Thynne and Judith behind ! The obnoxious Whytes had not done much worse than that came to. Mr. Thynne laughed his wife's protest to scorn, and put it down summarily while he provided carefully for her exemption from danger and fatigue. Judith stopped her mother's mouth with kisses ; and the good woman saw directly that her place as nursing-mother was with the very youngsters of her brood, who would grow and get beyond her capacity as the others had got beyond it. Then Judith and her father entered on their under taking, and were rewarded by finding it considerably lighter than they had ventured to expect. Mr. Cyril Gale had the disease in such a mild form that his case might have been incurred voluntarily by the process of inoculation. Patty, whose face was a seared and dinted testimony of what small-pox could prove to the survivor, and a standing monument to the young man of his own deliverance, sufficed as an attendant. Judith rather enjoyed this season of seclusion with her father, as she had enjoyed her imprisonment with her lively brothers. She had so much in common with her father, that the two were thoroughly companionable. Besides, this space of leisure, while it enabled Judith to clear off the family needlework, which she was proud of doing for her mother, gave to the father and daughter the oppor-"], [244, "Strength of Body and Mind. 230 tunity of discussing together those treatises on popular education which were making a noise in the intellectual world, and were occupying Richard Lovel Edgeworth and his daughter, Maria, with their friend, Mr. Day. Judith looked forward to Mr. Gale's first appearance in the drawing-room as laying her under the necessity of making an uncongenial acquaintance and practising a difficult hospitality. But in spite of Judith, her father had become interested in the young man to whom he had afforded shelter, and stood up in the lad's defence against Judith's implied disparagement. \" He is not at all profound \u2014 this gay young spark,\" Mr. Thynne would admit; \"but he is conversable and likeable.\" \"When was a gay young spark profound?\" Judith would ask, and finish off emphatically, \" If you will believe me, sir, it is easy to converse with you.\" \"Because I do all the talking myself, Miss Sauciness ? I should say you dispute the position with me there. But I know a good listener when I find him ; you will admit that. It is the more creditable to Mr. Cyril Gale that he can listen well when he is cut up and stung \u2014 not so much by the loss of his beauty, which besides being skin deep, will not be seriously damaged, as by the heartless conduct of his sister.\" The Spartan cast of Judith's education came out in her rejoinder : \u2014 \" I cannot understand how a man unkindly dealt with and unfortunate, can show his feelings to a casual observer.\""], [245, "Strength of Body and Mind. 231 But there was more in Judith than the effects of education. When she encountered the empurpled scarred young face, and was forced to recall the unhappy antecedents which, without any fault of his, had burdened the Thynnes with an unwelcome guest, she could not help a shade of embarrassment and agitation. She turned away her head to avoid looking at Cyril Gale more than he would like. By sedulously lending her aid to the conver sation, she contrived to avoid the most distant allusion to the storm and his accident. And she liked the young man as her father did. He was original if he was not profound ; and while he was frank and affectionate, with an impulsive trust in their good faith, he maintained a discreet reserve on his family trials, and did not appeal for pity. Very soon in their intercourse Judith grew sisterly towards Cyril Gale, who was at least three or four years her senior. He had neither mother nor sister, and he had not been so hardily educated for a man as Judith had been for a woman. He had been brought up with a shy, fastidious private tutor. The tutor had not made the pupil shy and fastidious, but the master had encouraged in the scholar fancifulness and waywardness. Events and Mr. Thynne's philanthropy and eccentricity were against that couple. Bringing them to dwell under the same roof, and leaving them to comfort and cheer each other, were unfavourable to them. Yet why should events and Mr. Thynne have not been in favour of the man and woman who were capable of blending and of bringing richer harmony out of contrast ? Worldly"], [246, "Strength of Body and Mind. 232 circumstances were not adverse in this instance. Cyril Gale was in possession of independent means. Only his city friend could have interfered with the young man's inclinations. And so far from the city friend being churl ish, he believed that it would be the best thing which could happen to Cyril, the most certain deliverance from all concern in his brother-in-law's miserable fortunes, if he should fancy Mr. Thynne's spirited, sensible daughter, and ally himself with a family equally strong minded and high-principled. Mr. Thynne was inclined to like the young fellow, and might very well entertain the idea of Cyril in a new relation. Mrs. Thynne was ready to welcome the stranger. Judith's brothers would have found no fault with the invader, who had entered their territory in the right of his gracious qualities. Some people would say that it must at least have been a malignant star which shed so baleful a light that it was likely to blast all this promise. The writer does not believe in malignant stars, but in a good Providence which shapes men's destinies \" rough hew them how they will ;\" believes also in a martyrdom which sometimes in this world crowns good men and women with a peculiar distinction; believes, lastly, in a punishment which, so long as the wheat and the tares grow together, involves the innocent with the guilty. There is on record a fatal accident in horsemanship in which if the rider had been a less perfect rider\u2014 that is. less firmly seated and fairly balanced \u2014 he would have been thrown when the animal reared, and might have survived, sustaining little injury. If Judith Thynne had"], [247, "Strength of Body and Mind. 233 been a weaker woman, with less power of restraint over herself and her lover, she would probably have been un seated from her throne of freedom and independence in the first struggle between them. She would have been abashed and mortified, perhaps, but she would have been raised by his gratified pride and tenderness, and drawn to his side for life and death. A stronger man than Cyril Gale would not have desired that Judith should be dethroned, in order to prove that he was her conqueror. He would have held his conquest even more triumphant and honourable for him, far sweeter and safer for her \u2014 for both \u2014 had she but bowed her head and whispered her allegiance in his ear, a secret between them for all time. The fact was, that Cyril Gale, with all his attractions, was not a strong man, and so he was in danger of losing Judith, and Judith of losing him. There were first these blissful weeks, when the two learned to know each other intimately, whilst they were shut up like Miranda and Ferdinand, with none save the banished duke to share their confinement. Greenwich, \u2014 with its river traffic, its bustle, noise, and mud ; its discontented old sailors, striving to reconcile themselves to national charity \u2014 however gallantly earned, charity still ; its astronomers watching the stars ; and its crowd of ordinary men and women, \u2014 was a desert island to Judith Thynne and Cyril Gale ; or rather, to the fated pair, it was the forbidden town of Camelot. There was the lesson of love, with the lurking anguish, which is the under side to all human love and bliss, yet is itself blissful."], [248, "Strength of Body arid Mind. 234 Then a difference came between the couple; one of those trifles light as air which baffles foresight, and the very flimsiness of which prevents its being dissipated. Cyril Gale wished to induce Judith to lay aside some of those books on natural philosophy and popular science which were beginning to inundate the world, and which she and her father were fond of mastering. He wished her to study with him Waller and Shenstone, to aim at something more akin to the \" Shakespeare and musical glasses \" cultivation, in which he was the more proficient. Judith had no individual objection. It was one of the great advantages of her healthy rearing, that her tastes were catholic and cosmopolitan. But she demurred at deserting her father in his intellectual pursuits when he counted upon her company. She was hurt at what sounded to her as an undervaluing of their sympathies. \" My father intends that we should read this work together, comparing notes on it,\" Judith urged in argu ment with herself. \"My father's pleasure should be para mount to-day, for the very reason that I'd as lief\u2014 I doubt I'd liefer \u2014 learn by heart the verses on which Cyril Gale sets store. But if he does not care for the practical knowledge, in which I have been taught to take the great est interest,\" Judith reflected, disconsolately, \"it seems as if he could not care for me any more than a Beau Fielding or a Beau Nash would care for a girl who plays on the spinnet but sorrily, and has no turn for dancing.\" Cyril took umbrage at his want of power to con strain Judith to renounce her own and her father's"], [249, "Strength of Body and Mind. 235 lines of thought in order to adopt his, so that Judith's loyalty to her father actually shook her influence with her lover. He said to himself in his turn, \"Judith Thynne does not care for me much, will never care for me except in a calm cold way. Women like her have benevolence but not tenderness.\" (Ah ! fool, fool, to judge that he should miss tenderness \u2014 slow of welling to the surface, for the very reason that the spring is deep and inexhaustible.) \" It is my loss and misery that we have been thrown together. After all, what should a noble, handsome woman see in an idle, changeable fellow like me ?'' If Cyril Gale had not been liable to depressing un belief in himself, if he had inherited or acquired more confidence, more self-conceit even, he might have safely weathered the rocks on which the bark of love was ready to founder, sinking him with his love. Cyril was already uneasily conscious that among his fine gifts of frankness and cordiality, constancy did not yet flourish. The difference between Judith Thynne and Cyril Gale arose at that advanced stage of his recovery when it was decided that the infection of small-pox had passed away. Mrs. Thynne and her children, whom Cyril had banished from home, were at liberty to return. But to render assurance doubly sure, Cyril left before the absent members of the family came back, and stayed away a short time to reappear speedily. He was again at Greenwich, in the old house opposite the park, this time as a familiar friend. But the little dryness between him and Judith had not vanished, and the unfettered"], [250, "236 Strength of Body and Mind. intercourse which had existed between them when they were under quarantine, could not be resumed when the large family were reassembled, with many more claims besides her father's upon Judith's time and attention. Cyril lingered a while in Judith's neighbourhood ; but waiting was not in poor Cyril's way, waiting was for such as Judith. Suddenly, like a child taking a pet, he departed a second time, and came back no more. The bald conclusion is easily written, and yet something like it often holds crystallized the story of a whole lifetime and of a death-blow. Judith waited \" forsaken,\" waited through the months when the thorns in the park were white and fragrant, till they were covered with blood-red berries, till the berries blackened and shrivelled, till the bushes themselves were stripped and bare \u2014 on through the years when the Spanish chestnuts were renewed once and again in their yellow feathery sprays, their ripe prickly nuts, and their gaunt arms against a wintry sky. There was nothing more to be done than wait, silent, without a sign of wrong done or taken, stiffening in womanly pride, as Cyril had been silent as to the scandal of his kindred. Waiting meant no more than a slow starvation of heart, to be followed by stabs to the quick. In the meantime Cyril Gale was too much stung by regret to retrace his steps. He was diverted and drawn into the whirl of other amusements and engage ments. The Thynnes heard of him incidentally without speaking much of him among themselves. They were too sorry and ashamed on his account to allow them-"], [251, "Strength of Body and Mind. 237 pelves to speak of him, while they writhed under the gossip which his behaviour had provoked. He was in the gay world. He frequented the watering places, which i'ere so much the resort of the idle and foolish, as well as of worthier company, in the beginning of the century. There was a rumour that he was about to contract a rash marriage, ill-assorted, though it would be the means of repairing the fortune which he had already damaged. There was a second rumour that the erratic spirit had entered the Peninsular army as a volun teer, and the report was certified by proof that he had been slain in his first battle. Judith had never been without a spirit of devotion ; but hers was not the sort of devotion which could make her thankful with a sense of escape when she heard how Cyril Gale had perished. In the first burst of her anguish, the feeling which she experienced was much nearer to that confessed by an apostle. Like St. Paul, she would sooner almost that her own life had misgiven and failed, than that his had been wasted, because she had loved Cyril as her own soul. Judith suffered from the tribulation of her love in pro portion to the strength of her nature. A weaker nature would undoubtedly have suffered less, but a weaker nature would have been in greater peril of succumbing to suffering. It is the simple truth that many a woman dies of such suffering, dies either in body or spirit ; and a spiritual death is worse, more cruel than a bodily death. Judith was strong, and, therefore, she did not die ; but"], [252, "Strength of Body and Mind. 238 she fell under a sickening of body and spirit, which was strange and grievous to her, and to all who loved her. Thus late in the day, Mr. Thynne asked himself, had he done wrong to mould Judith of sterner stuff than women are wont to be moulded of, so that light fancies \u2014love lightly placed, and to be as lightly displaced, with its wounds easily healed \u2014 were not for her? Had he been more merciful to a stranger in distress than to his own daughter whom he had thrust into danger? Mrs. Thynne could only smooth her daughter's hair, cool her brow, and pat her hand as she had done when she soothed the child Judith to sleep. In Judith's sickness and sorrow, the mother was a little consoled because she had got back the child. Judith's brothers bent their brows in pain and wrath. The very children in the house stood hushed by Judy's incomprehensible helpless ness and apathy; while the servants could hardly be restrained from crying out, in rough sincerity, \" What a shame that a man could have so hurt the bravest of women and mistresses !\" But Judith had not gone down to the very place of dragons to be beaten by them. She saw the suffering of others amid her own suffering ; she had regard to the misery in the wistful eyes, once so keen in their specula tions, which looked into her worn and faded face. She summoned all her forces to do battle with the deadly bitterness and dejection which had taken possession of her. What did it matter though she lived a few or even many years more? It was her duty to live, and God would enable her to do her duty, were it only in"], [253, "Strength of Body and Mind. 239 response to the fatherly love which had been lavished upon her all her life by her earliest and oldest friend, to whom her death, little as she was worth, would be sore loss. Judith would not die. She would look up to her Father in Heaven, and then she would look out on her father on earth with restored light in her eyes and breath between her lips. She would rise up again and walk by his side, his chosen friend and companion, making up to him for the deficiencies in friendship and companionship which his life had known. Judith fought her battle and conquered ; partly because she was strengthened, partly because she was herself strong in body and mind, and able to overcome and shake off bodily and mental ailment. Judith was given back to her people dearer and wiser than before. Her nature was purified and elevated, for she had been compelled to recognise her own powerless ness to redeem either herself or another from faults and sins, and sorrows. She had been compelled to trust another dear as herself, and with him to turn to divine merit and mercy.

What would she do without the full faith of a Saviour in whom Cyril Gale might have believed and repented ? and if for Cyril in his sointness, which became falseness, then for herself in her strength, which might have been hard ness \u2014 which indeed had been hardness to heavenly influences.

ENDURANCE. \" Her candle goeth not out by night.\" T^NDURANCE can be variously classed \u2014 as self- \"' restraint, foresight, perseverance, and loyalty. To produce self-restraint is one of the great ends of education. Where education has done its best and this result is still wanting, the education has been a failure, whatever other results may have been attained. And this is equally the case whether the education has been radically wrong, or only wrongly administered, or whether adverse circumstances have destroyed what ought to have been its fruit. It is a fact, however, that a liberal education may be so far depended upon to cultivate this form of endurance \u2014 self-restraint. During the Crimean war the sufferings of the officers, who often worked, and shared their camp-stores, with their men, were less than those of the common soldiers. Being well-nurtured and intelligent, the officers could sustain and surmount greater hardships by dint of their clearer comprehension of the bearings of the case, and by resolution and anticipation. The private soldier showed himself really softer and more effeminate in his R"], [256, "Endurance. 242 rudeness and ignorance than his superiors, and frequently fell a victim to circumstances where they escaped. It is notorious that if you subject a thorough gentle woman and her servant to the same severe test of fatigue \u2014 scorching and drenching by \"the elements,\" or starving and poisoning by insufficient and bad food \u2014 in nine cases out of ten it will be found that the delicate mistress will come triumphantly through the ordeal, even to the solacing and supporting of her stricken-down servant. I would have you girls and women to remember, as I would fain remember myself, that there is no more decisive mark of essential low-breeding than a fretting at all worries. This is what distinguishes a peevish woman, be she a sulky young beauty or the wearing scold of middle-aged matronhood and spinsterhood. Not to be fit to bear even the changes of the weather without murmuring ; not to be equal to contemplating with equanimity a chance wetting by a passing shower, or a chill from a north-east wind ; not to be able to patiently bear the deferring of some excursion or visit, which depended on the weather \u2014 is so silly in a reason able being, so undignified and ungracious in a Christian girl or woman, that one could hardly credit the possibility of such offences, were they not frequently obtruded on the observer's attention. As a slight proof of the wide incapacity for the simplest form of endurance, let me instance the increas ing use of the fans of continental and tropical countries in our large, commonly cool, and not over-crowded churches and chapels. Evf n while clergyman and con-"], [257, "Endurance. 243 gregation are engaged in the solemn act of prayer, a gentle waving to and fro of those doubtful instruments of relief is carried on by languid and languishing fan-bearers. In the lower walks of private life there are cases innumerable of this deficiency in self-restraint. We see it in the coat thrown off, and the sleeves of the gown pulled up to the elbow, and we hear it in the puffing and groaning, which of themselves add a thousand runlets to the perspiration streaming from every pore ; or we see and hear it in the group shivering and huddling together and suffering their teeth to chatter at the first approach of frost. These things betray the same ungallant and fatuous revolt against the mild grievances which are common to all, and which descend far more heavily on field workers than on tradesmen and trades men's wives and daughters \u2014 on toiling members of families and on helpless, suffering invalids, than on those rebels against God's beneficent ordinances of the seasons. To be put out of sorts by the loss of precedence in going into a room, by the misfitting of a gown, the malflavouring of a dish, or the breaking of a specimen of china, is not only undignified but despicable ; while to cry out under every spasm of headache or sickness is unworthy of girls and women who know better and pretend to higher things. Yet these are not rare exhibitions. Leave Englishmen and Englishwomen the luxury of grumbling by all means. But there is grumbling with a difference. There is humorous, kindly grumbling \u2014 a sort of banter, as good as rejoicing. And there is growling and snapping, from which may we be delivered.

I beseech them to think better of their practice in this respect, and to lay it to heart that nothing worth having can be attained without endurance. Let such girls recall all the old texts of the old Bible on endurance of hardship, and perseverance in well-doing, from \" Her candle went not out by night \" onwards and downwards in the stream of time. Moreover, I ask such readers not to misunderstand me ; I do not seek to make self-martyrs of them, even in trifles. I hold with the maintainers of a fair feature in the Protestant creed, that endurance for endurance's sake has not, and cannot have, any possible merit without casting a horrible stigma on the goodness of God.

Carried into a lofty region, the excru ciating self-tortures of ascetics were sublimely sincere and constant, but they were examples of a sublime blunder and of constancy in a delusion. Self-restraint has a farther development when it deals not with minor but with major trials. When families are reduced from affluence to poverty, and strong men and women brought by one blow to the condition of children who will never grow to maturity \u2014 when men and women are stripped and left bare in human friendlessness \u2014 if the loss can be but modestly, cheerfully borne, it is at least freed from its bitterness. There is a curious law of compensation in losses as in other things in this world. Poor men have joys which, paradoxical as it may sound, are beyond the reach of rich men. Invalids have their exquisite relish of this or that pleasure which the coarser palates of their healthy brethren never taste. Even the friendless (God help them !) are surely helped by God himself. They are lightened of half their burden of care and fear for the friends whom their souls loved and still love. They are enabled to look wistfully to the land which is far away, where not alone will the dead be given back, but alienated and estranged friends, with eyes cleared and hearts drawn afresh, may once more approach like Jacob's brethren and recognise a brother once rejected but now accepted for ever. The French proverb of accepting the situation may sound conventional and politic, but it is truly good when truly held. It is marvellous what heights can be stormed and what spoil can be won by simple endurance"], [260, "246 Endurance. \u2014 how in verity \" the worst turns the best to the brave.'' What richness and raciness, what sunshine, all the more rainbow-like in its splendour that it holds unshed tears in its beams, may be discovered in adversity which is courageously and heartily sustained, such as were never yet distinguished in the blinding glare and heady fumes of prosperity ! Here is the reason why the struggles of many a worthy couple have been sweeter to them than the subsequent deserved successes. The difference of one age from another has not had everything to do with it. Whole generations and classes of men who have suffered from persecutions, and been charming people in their day of trouble, have become much less delightful so soon as they rose in the scale and had their day of honour and power. No doubt, even worldly prosperity is good, and a gift of God which we do well to desire ; but He still keeps his best for the beaten who can consent to be beaten at His hand. I believe that there is no jewel in the front of prosperity so precious as that which is set in the head of adversity. At the same time true endurance is an endurance of evils which do not admit of being cured. To substitute endure for cure is to abuse the quality and the term. No special blessing, no blessing at all in the nature of things, can follow upon indolence or indifference, or on weakness akin to wickedness. Endurance which takes the shape of foresight is endurance which is deliberate in the fulfilment of duty and in the faith of reward. It has been said already that such foresight or endurance is a near ally of genius,"], [261, "Endurance. 247 as well as a strong element in religion. Palissy the potter, Watt, and Jenner, foresaw or endured. So the Apostle Paul foresaw, when he looked forward from earth to Heaven, from his toils and afflictions to a just recompense of reward. The fostering of this foresight, like the fostering of enterprise, would prepare the way for many a hopeful contest and triumphant achievement. At the bottom of much disastrous wreck and ruin lies the wilful blindness alike of gifted and non-gifted. The cost must be counted before the battle is engaged in, else the first defeat will in all likelihood prove the last. To try and calculate honestly all the probabilities, to anticipate and to make preparation for all the casualties, and even to provide a way of retreat, is half to win the day beforehand, or, if not to win that day, certainly to win another, perhaps a more glorious day. The head of a house or family who will go on following his own way, and the ways of his household, in self-indulgence and in family indulgence, profanes and falsifies the command to take no thought for the morrow. He is cowardly and foolish, and justly demoralised into being a pauper on the future. If a painter, a poet, or an inventor, will faithfully follow the bent of his genius, let him shun, as one would shun dishonour and disgrace, lavish expenses and luxurious habits. To incur debts which have only to be reckoned in order to be recognised as beyond the hope of discharge \u2014 to acquire tastes, and to give-in to customs the renunciation ot which will be a life -long penance \u2014 these are not the acts of pure idealists, but of gravely culpable men and women.

Shame on the genius who thus disgraces genius and holds a gift in dishonesty 1 Let men and women see to it that they lead simple lives, and do not run into temptation or encumber themselves with weights which may sink them. The pampering of vanity and pride, which the old prophet called thick clay, is thick clay still, and will clog our steps and tend to corruption. Endurance regarded in the light of perseverance is a compound of patience and activity. It is the receiving of the cup and the drinking of it to the dregs; the walking onward until one drops ; the working till the 'ask falls from the relaxed fingers. While it is the crown ini! culmination of the virtue of endurance, it becomes easier than may be imagined. The great effort is to make a genuine beginning, and not a mere flourish of trumpets. Once begun, it is less difficult to continue. The longer man and woman maintain well-doing, the more possible, the more practicable the well-doing will be. In the end it grows absoluteh hard to leave it off. But unquestionably there are to the end slips and stumbles, pit-falls, and unexpected rocks ahead, to be met with and overcome. The Pilgrim of Pilgrims was in the land of Beulah before his trials ceased. There is nothing more awfully sad in human history than the final wreck of man or woman who started well, and who long"], [263, "Endurance. 249 weathered ground-swell and storm, only to founder within sight of the haven where the tossed ship might at last have anchored in peace. Humility, self-distrust, faith in God and godliness, is the safeguard against ultimate destruction \u2014 the pledges that man or woman will resist unto blood, and continue stedfast to the end. Loyalty belongs also to endurance ; for without the practice of endurance one cannot imagine the existence of loyalty, which may best be defined as chivalrous endur ance asserted for the sake of another. There is a general impression that women are at once the most capable and the most incapable of the higher examples of loyalty. Among women are to be found the most loyal and the most disloyal of human kind. I don't know that this proves more than that there are good and bad women as there are good and bad men ; and that in all questions of feeling, women's qualities, whether good or evil, stand out in bold relief. I deny that the sole line of loyalty in which women excel, and in which their fame has been largely sung and painted, is the line of romantic and extravagant homage to kings and chiefs, like poor Prince Charlie. I deny emphatically that the pith and grace of women's loyalty lie in the blind idolatry with which some women regard their lovers, brothers, husbands, sons ; endowing them with god-like qualities, the very reverse of any which the men can claim ; whilst the women are inca pable of seeing in them the faults and follies for which the men are conspicuous in the eyes of other men. I am ready to qualify my denial by admitting that many a weak silly woman who can do nothing but cling, and does not see"], [264, "Endurance. 250 save by the eyes of another, may still have treasures of kindness and constancy in her tender heart. But I insist that there is no good woman with wit and sense who is so blind to the weaknesses and errors of the friends whom she loves, as to prove the most efficient ministers to their flaws and failings. Especially in the case of children, I do not believe that any upright and intelligent woman will ignore naughtiness in the child till that child has grown man or woman, to turn and rend the heart of the unhappy mother who did what she could to ruin her darling. I acknowledge that good and rational women who are keenly alive to their own defects are better furnished than men to throw a veil of charity over shortcomings which they deplore. But it is idle in men and women to flatter themselves that any woman who is not a fool can be blind to demonstrations and deeds which have a patent existence. It is worse than idle; because an honest, not to say a noble-hearted man or woman ought not to crave the love which is grounded on self-deception. He or she knows little of the true love of woman who fears to trust her with a whole catalogue of lapses however pitiable, and of sins however grievous. That unbelieving man or woman who demands gross idolatry from his or her nearest friend has no hunger and thirst after righteous ness, and no burning desire to grow clean in heart, and pure in spirit. I think that there have been as many women righteously and honourably loyal as there have been women sordid, incapable, and bigoted. Women have never failed in men's deepest need. In those"], [265, "Endurance. 251 religious struggles in which women have taken a deeper interest, and been placed more on an equality with men than in other social struggles, they have shown them selves at least as devoted as men. Granted that Roger Williams's wife remained behind him and consented to his banishment from New England on account of his doctrine of religious toleration, other wives \u2014those, for instance, of the pilgrim fathers, whose children drove out Roger Williams \u2014 went cheerfully into banishment with their husbands ; nay, were forward in urging them not to bate one jot or tittle of their faith. Again, the German women hailed Luther on his way to the diet at Worms, and called out to him, \" He who denieth me before men, him will I also deny before my Father and his angels,\" and thus bore their testimony. In purely secular reforms, and in scientific and artistic progress, women have been cramped by great ignorance. But from the days of the Roman matron Cornelia to those of the Spanish Queen Isabella, there never have been wanting women ready to take up and pro mote great projects, offering up gallant sons and crown diamonds, ease and pleasantness, and innocent dreams. If Agnes Diirer and Madame Palissy harassed and burdened the already harassed and burdened painter and potter, Margaret Van Eyck listed a share of drudgery from the shoulders of her painter brothers ; Caroline Herschel learned mathematics in a few weeks in order to act as assistant to her astronomer; Rachel Lady Russell stood nobly by her martyr. But loyalty too must count the cost before accepting"], [266, "Endurance. 252 its enterprise. No undisciplined, self-indulgent girl 01 woman need aspire to endure for another any more than for herself. Think of it, you girls, who refuse to learn hardness, who fancy that it is womanly to be luxurious, who are small-minded, whimsical, exacting in various ways, and in all things irrational and selfish. You shut yourselves out from the noble office to which you were ordained. You may be toys for worthless men, and spoilt children for superior men ; but you have frittered away the better part of your inheritance. You can never hope to be friends and fellow-labourers of men deserving the name, because there are no Cinderella transformations in real life. There is a field of loyalty on which I can but touch, and that belongs as much to mercy as to loyalty. When the member of a family sins and comes to grief, the remaining members, if they are true kindred, will not only suffer with him, but seek to rally round him, to raise him up, and to save him if it be possible. They may have blamed and shunned him before his sins brought their punishment ; but he is punished now, and their lips refuse to condemn him when other lips are opened against him. Kindred asserts itself and comes forward to shield and defend kindred. Thus many poor women serve their unhappy men, and if there is a lurking remnant of good in the sinner's heart, the loyal service may be his salvation. But there is another, and a mistaken dealing with the sinner who is not punished, who is only hardened and brazen under his punishment. This is a dealing which,"], [267, "Endurance. 253 while it is disloyal to the law of righteousness, is also disloyal to the sinner,because it can be of no avail to him, save to increase his condemnation. I do not care to speak of such disloyalty, I do not take it upon me to judge the men and women who practise it. I can only hope that God will show them that it is not faithfulness to others to be false to themselves and to their Maker ; that there are eternal verities of right and wrong which no man or woman can change, and which every man and woman is bound to maintain intact. To blur and distort these verities, or so to confound them in the apprehension of one's neighbour that he is in danger of being bewildered and led astray, is to commit what is in itself a grave sin, and what with regard to the original sinner is but sowing the wind to reap the whirlwind. One hears a great deal in strong condemnation of what is called lip loyalty ; but I wish to speak a word in disfavour of lip disloyalty. I am ready to acknowledge, with a considerable amount of vexation, that this is a species of disloyalty in the display of which women are more conspicuous than men. There is a loyalty which forbears to tattle about the disagreeable peculiarities of one's friends, which demurs at prying into every fold of their coats \u2014 or rather of their gowns \u2014 until it has picked holes in them, and then holds up the holes almost exultingly for the benefit of a sneering public. The reverse of this, which is exhibited in the contempt of the venerable obligation of bread and salt, the kissing with a bland mouth, and, immediately afterwards, sticking pins in the back of the woman kissed, is an ungenerous"], [268, "Endurance. 254 habit, verging on what is base, and I fancy it is more common in women than in men. It is not by any means confined, as has been alleged, to single women, though naturally it is more dominant in them. It is to be recognised everywhere, in matrons as in maidens, and at all ages. It may be that, as women have more tact, men on the other hand may have greater largeness and breadth of nature ; and that therefore men are neither so fastidious and hypocritical, nor so driven lo proclaim their criticism to the world, as women find them selves. But I can never believe that good women are inherently jealous and spiteful any more than that good men are radically envious. My impression is that the foundation of this carping and small snarling arises from the comparative idleness of many women, in combination with the great tendency to gossip which such idleness engenders. I don't condemn gossip wholesale as many moralists do not hesitate to condemn it. I am prepared to defend friendly gossip as not only a necessity to men and women, but as a valuable safety-valve for their abounding sympathies by which they may blow off their spare thoughts and feelings, and so avoid a horrible explosion of selfishness. The most unamiable, and I need not say the most selfish, nay, sometimes the weakest of men and women, are often alike in this, that they are remarkably exempt from an inclination to gossip, an exemption, too, on which they are apt to pride themselves with little cause for pride. I have taken pleasure in tracing out the word gossip \u2014"], [269, "Endurance. 255 God-sib, in vindication of an alliance through God in a common humanity, with a fellow-feeling in humanity's joys and sorrows. Christian men and women are bidden to weep and rejoice at the due seasons of family weeping and rejoicing. How shall Christian men and women weep and rejoice for that misfortune or that blessing of which they have no knowledge, or know at best but the meagre outlines ? But to use gossip is one thing, to abuse it is another. There is gossip and gossip. Let gossip degenerate into scandal and slander, and it has gone far beyond the province of gossip, has ceased to be gossip. If what is ordinarily decried as lip loyalty - \u2014 loyalty which is confined to the lip \u2014 is bad, then lip disloyalty is also bad. May girls and women, when they are together \" talking over \" other girls and women, recoil from the kind of treachery involved in suddenly seizing the microscope, to detect all the flaws in the very person to whose face the same speakers were full of nothing save endearments and approbation ! I am aware that many girls and women are alive to this duplicity w-hich is allowed to prevail\u2014 so much alive that they fall into the opposite error. If they own a bosom friend, or even an intimate acquaintance, they are so frightened lest they should drop a word in her disparage ment, that they are tempted to praise her right and wrong, to overwhelm and bury her under a load of indiscriminate praise. Simplicity and truth would no more choose the last extreme than a kindly nature would rush into the first. All praise is no praise, and she who cannot"], [270, "256 Endurance. censure, cannot praise ; but haste to censure one's dear friend and delight in the work of censure is a frame of mind not to be admired in woman \u2014 or in man. After all, I can believe that this failure in friendship frequently does not go beyond lip disloyalty. I am satisfied that many of the girls and women who indulge in cutting comment and biting satire on the members of their circles would be ready the next moment to do a kindness to the very women whom they have been ridiculing and cavilling at, yet surely it would be well to get rid of this abuse of gossip, this ugly blemish of lip disloyalty which is oftener to be met with in women than in men. The great security against it may be sought in a more enlightened comprehension of the civilisation and refinement of Christianity and a more thorough practice of its rules. The next antidote is in the greater expansion of mind, together with the corresponding increase of interests and occupations, which a better education will provide for women. STANDING IN HER LOT ON GOD'S EARTH. The old Fullers of Maymead were a family of good i epute in Kent. They were small gentry, and had been paper-makers. About the same time that Evelyn had taken to powder-making at Wotton, the Fullers had a mill at Maymead. It was in the Fuller blood to be pioneers and social reformers, were it only by making a record of"], [271, "Endurance. 257 \" Worthies.\" Septimus Fuller was a great friend of \" Travelled Thynne's \" in those days when Mr. Fuller gave over the mill at Maymead to a brother, and opened a bookseller's shop whence knowledge was to be shed abroad upon the people of Greenwich. But Septimus Fuller, public-spirited and disinterested as he was, proved deficient in those qualities of tact and prudence which are quite as requisite as liberal daring to render an enterprise successful. Neither was the time nor the place ripe for the man and his opinions. Mr. Thynne had found that, in a measure, Mr. Fuller went a good deai further and fared a great deal worse than he had done. 'she \" flitting \" from Maymead was the first of a series of flittings which fell to the lot of Cassandra Fuller. She was a young wife then, and had not been long established in her husband's family home. But she had become already greatly attached to it \u2014 all the more that she had suffered \" the misfortune,\" as she was wont to call it, of having been brought up in London. Although she was the child of parents in good circumstances, her home had been \" a dear dull house, in a dear dull square.\" To the day of her death she would descant with enthusiasm on the fields and grounds of Maymead when she first made its acquaintance as a bride \u2014 on the paddock, the strips of plantation, and the wild shrubberies. Her blue eyes would deepen and darken in the zest with which she would describe the snowdrops, crocuses, wild hyacinths and daffodils, primroses and cowslips, white lilies and tiger lilies ; bowers of early roses, and carpets of late stock; the murmuring limes and the mountain S"], [272, "258 Endurance. ashes (\"though,\" as she always paused to remark emphatically, \" there were no mountains, you know \"J, the elms \u2014 hedgerow elms and wych elms ; the oaks \u2014 English oaks and Turkey oaks. Maymead remained a cherished memory to Cassandra, but she left it without a grudge, and came with her husband to a pretty house called Dairy Farm, which was in the same plight as the mountain ashes at Maymead, inasmuch as there was no dairy then at Dairy Farm. But it had the advantage of being within an easy morning or evening's walk from Mr. Fuller's low-browed, square-windowed shop in the High Street. Cassandra was impressed with her husband's work there, though she herself belonged to that rare type of men and women who are so bright naturally that they seem to be in a manner independent of derived knowledge. Her husband declared that to listen to her original observations on men and manners, on animals and their habits, on what she had noticed in her walks and in her gardening, was better than reading most printed books. And his testimony ought to have been of worth. He was a bookworm of the first water, ready to expend his patrimony on supplying the people with enlightening books, and to take the chance of winning the money back again. Cassandra was not only a light in herself, but light came to her from many sources. She had less need than most of us to apply hard to a printed source. Yet she was fond of reading, and delighted to be read to, interspersing the reading \u2014 whether her own or another's \u2014 with lively observations. In the same way she was fond of chatting ;"], [273, "Endurance. 259 exceedingly fond of listening to chat. Besides, she was fond of walking, of gardening, of housekeeping, of making friends with and fostering the whole animal world. Septimus used to declare that Cassandra's name was a great imposition. If he had married her, founding upon her name an expectation that she would prove a make weight or check to hold him back in his schemes, by anticipating the losses which would ensue, he had been dreadfully taken in and ought to be let off from his share in the contract; for in her youthful prime she was the soul of sanguine, sunny-tempered womanhood. She could interest herself in every occupation and aim, however foreign to her own pursuits and aspirations. She would listen to Judith Thynne reading Greek, which was dead letter to her, and be taken up with the trans lation, although the spirit of the translation escaped her largely. She would collect shells for Margaret Copeland, and would never weary of watching Margaret grouping them, though, for Cassandra's part, she continued re verently ignorant of art and its technical applications. She was ready to go with Tilly Bond and read to the illiterate old pensioners, or teach the beggar children, though for the greater part of her life she was forced to acquiesce in the advice which bids charity begin at home, and had little time or means to spare for outside charity. She was not a whit behind in admiring the exquisitely fitting surroundings of beautiful Bennet Le Strange. Everything which Cassandra Fuller took part in she did it with all her might. She was not a highly gifted, or s 2"], [274, "260 Endurance. particularly well-informed woman, in the world's sense; but I think that, in width of sympathy and power of adaptation, she was very clever ; and that if she had been the moying spirit in her husband's enterprise, instead of a mere coadjutor in it, it need not have failed as it did fail. Above all, Cassandra was \" everybody's body,\" and won derfully popular through the affections. She was a little thoughtless when she was young, and got herself and her friends into a few scrapes by her indiscretion ; but even then she always managed to bring herself, and especially her friends, out of \" the abominable pickle \" into which she had misled them. The process of extrication was successfully effected by her simple straight-forwardness and perfect good-will. In person, Cassandra Fuller was not so much a beautiful, as a winning woman. Her figure was good, though, at the various periods of her life, it tended to different extremes. She was slim in youth, and portly in middle age. She had high cheek-bones and was a little sallow, while her eyebrows were too drooping. But she had a good, well-marked nose ; a gem of a mobile mouth ; lively, kindly eyes, and the clearest of candid foreheads. She liked gay, light colours in dress, as Mrs. Culpepper at Formidable House liked deep, bright colours. The primrose, the peach blossom, the pale green \u2014 and in particular certain pink ribands which Cassandra wore in her caps, \" became Mrs. Fuller mightily,\" as people still said in her day, even after she was somewhat stout and heavy. The youthful heart of the woman was reflected in her bodily presence."], [275, "Endurance. 261 Cassandra soon took root at Dairy Farm, and had pride in the old red-brick house with the steep red porch The house would have been altogether too red had it not been draped with the broad rich green of wild vines, garlanded with the piled white snow of clematis, and set with the purple and amber fruit of plums. Maymead had been the paradise of Cassandra's honey moon, which began at seventeen. Dairy Farm was her earthly home till she was a wife of thirteen years' standing, and was thirty years of age. She had left May mead very much as she had come to it ; but at Dairy Farm she had lived to see the slips of willow and cherry tree, which she had planted, give her shade and afford her fruit ; while the primroses and hyacinths which she had borrowed from Maymead had become almost as abun dant at Dairy Farm. And Dairy Farm had its special boons. There was a damp corner where such miniature forests of lily of the valley grew, and there was a sunny bed which furnished such baskets-full of sweet violets as Cassandra had not known at Maymead. The Maymead hay had been sweet, but the Dairy Farm woodrufte and lavender were sweeter and grew nearer home. At Maymead, Cassandra's animal kingdom had included carriage horses, ponies, cows and calves ; at Dairy Farm these dwindled to a watch-dog and a pet lamb, but never had horse been so faithful as Oscar, or calf so playful as Phillis.

The Fullers quitted Dairy Farm because Mr. Fuller, who had started in life with many advantages \u2014 the suc cession to his father's paper-mill, \" lying money,\" excellent business connections, and extensive credit \u2014 had so far got rid, happily in a good cause, of all these good things. He was entering on the pecuniary difficulties from which he did not emerge. He was liberal in politics at a time when conservatism was not only rampant, but when the excess of the French Revolution had brought all liberalism into shocking disrepute. The publications which Mr. Fuller supported for the enlightenment of Greenwich and its neighbourhood, were more or less tinged with dis satisfied dissent from church and state establishments. They not only failed to secure adequate encourage ment, but gradually drew down on the devoted head of their propagator an always increasing storm of potent public wrath. Not a whit did Septimus Fuller abate his liberal and dissenting bias. On the contrary, in his doggedness, he threatened to out-Cobbet Cobbet, and to wax rabid in his radicalism. It was at this period that Dr. Aikin, a cool, accomplished physician, so offended his aristocratic and wealthy patients by holding the same principles, that he was forced to resign the practice which was leaving him every day, and quit Yarmouth to spend half a lifetime in learned, and not unbeneficial leisure. It would have been well for"], [277, "Endurance. 263 Mr. Fuller if his principles had induced him to abandon his trade instead of pushing it. Following the latter course, he was virtually condemned to persecution, and had to meet the hostility of nearly an entire class and generation. Not only was he subjected to slander and abuse ; he was at times even in danger of his life. Yet the prolonged martyrdom was not without its indem nifying circumstances both to the martyr and his wife. But Septimus Fuller's losses in trade, and the bad odour in which he was held by his neighbours, had not reached their climax, when the couple were compelled to sublet Dairy Farm and draw yet farther into the town, to occupy cheaper quarters in a moderate-sized house in one of the side streets, with an apology for a garden, in the shape of a back green running up between other back greens and their shadowing walls. Cassandra declared that her fourth home reminded her of her first, \" the dear dull home \" in the London square, where she had been brought up, and where Septimus Fuller of Maymead had come a courling her. In making the comparison Cassandra chose to forget that there was a difference between the spacious house of the opulent London merchant, and the shabby, inconvenient house of a Green wich bookseller, who, by insisting on going before the world, was falling behind the world, and getting into decidedly embarrassed circumstances. What did it matter to the world that he was one of the gently born Fullers of Maymead ? That only served to aggravate his offence, since he was as much a renegade from his order as Lafayette and Mirabeau were renegades from"], [278, "Endurance. 264 theirs. Cassandra, at this date, could not exalt too much the animated life of the streets, the old attraction of the street cries, and the amusement which she found in the sight of the ladies going shopping and paying visits in their furs or laces, attended by the gentlemen of their houses or by polite acquaintances. What did it signify that hardly one of these ladies called upon Cas sandra Fuller \u2014 their equal both by birth and marriage \u2014 or welcomed her to the town ? She had been almost as much a favourite with them when they had known her at Maymead and Dairy Farm as Margaret Massey was a favourite with them so long as she was at liberty to be a social favourite. Cassandra asserted that she had not been sufficiently intimate with many of the ladies to be much hurt by their defection, and maintained, with cheerful ingenuity, that it was a gain to her at this time to have few visitors and to live almost out of the world. Her health was delicate just then, and her accommoda tion for company was deficient, at least till she had learnt how to make the most of the accommodation. Making merry over the antithesis, she could tell that she was not the first great person who had sought and found retirement in Church Street, Greenwich. Not many years before, as violent \"v Tory as Cassandra's husband was a Whig, had taken lodgings there for quietness, cheapness, and country air, as he had thought the air of Greenwich. Big, lumber ing, shambling man as he was in his ill put on snuff-coloured suit, he had not wanted much accommodation for himself or his work, seeing that he composed his famous tragedy of Irene rambling about the glades and alleys of the park. It"], [279, "Endurance. 265 is to be feared that Dr. Johnson would have sent Septimus Fuller to the galleys along with the seditious traitors of history, had the worthy bookseller come within the great lexicographer's ken. But the friend of blind hot-tempered Mrs. Williams would have had great pity for Cassandra (which doubtless she would have scorned) and her sickly baby. Her only child was born in Church Street. But it was so sickly, that its mother held that any larger field of operation or walking ground than was included in her cosy little parlour and her sheltered strip of garden would have been lost on them both, for she could not have ventured to take baby further excursions. Cassandra's son lived to be three years old, then pined altogether, and his body was deposited among the heavy stones of St. Alphege's churchyard. \" The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away,\" sobbed Cassandra. \" It would be a sin in me to reflect that my child might have lived and thriven in the fresh country air, among the calves and lambs of Maymead, (my little lamb was so fond of being beside young things like himself), or even in the sunshine, and among the flowers of Dairy Farm, for the Lord gave Johnnie to me here, where the Lord has taken Johnnie back to himself. I must not think of what might have been. I must rise up and comfort Johnnie's father, who takes on worse than I \u2014 men always take on worse than women in the beginning.

I had not time to rear even the commonest. Ah ! dear, I thought I should make that and everything else up to him ; and his father believed that Johnnie would grow up a fine man to utter his protest against tyrants, and herald the reign of political truth and freedom whenever that may come.\" Cassandra was not an entire convert to her husband's opinions ; though she was less of a conservative than n'_3ny women. Good, easy tempered as she was, she was passionately indignant with wrongdoers of every description. She sympathised deeply with the sufferers of wrong, and with her husband as a chief sufferer. She was proudly convinced of the purity of his motives. She was even a little vain of his martyrdom, and of her share in it. \" I don't care though everybody knows that I have never any better stuff than bombasate and calicot for my gowns now,\" she was inclined to boast; \" it is better that the public should 10b me, than that I should rob the public. I should not mind either that people were aware how plain we have to live, how I am parting with Molly Tuck, my last maid, (I began housekeeping with three, and a man or two,) because I cannot afford her wages, and I am able for all the little work in the rooms we're going to.

I won't have anybody's pity, I count myself clean above it. So I'm glad that I chance to thrive like the Hebrew youths on their pulse and w-ater, and that it comes natural to me to wash my face and anoint my head when I fast, otherwise I should be ashamed to be fat and fair, while my poor good man is as brown and shrivelled as a mummy, though he must allow himself his share in the jug of beer which he is forced to offer to a friend and customer \u2014 that is not often, granting that politics is a thirsty trade \u2014 nor in most cases is the friend without need of the beer.\" In spite of the vindication of her position, Mrs. Fuller was only an advanced liberal of the eighteenth century \u2014 a liberal before her time. It was not in her character to look out for abuses and to sit in judgment on them, even in order to make the world better. She was more inclined to take all the good she could get in existing institutions, and to make the best of them. Cassandra's hand left to itself, would not have been the one to fling the torch of civil war into the church in which she had been brought up, and in con nection with which she had affectionate recollections of fatherly rectors and brotherly curates, however changed"], [282, "268 Endurance. their faces might have become to her. So far as vehement opposition to the Church of England went, she was but a lukewarm dissenter. In this respect she incurred from some of her husband's friends the open accusation of being a false sister, hankering after the flesh-pots of Egypt, and looking back to the towers of Sodom. \" As if flesh-pots had not grown very scarce to Septimus and me,\" she protested, with her inextinguish able humour, \" and as if I had not always preferred the country to the town.\" Cassandra forgave, the more freely and generously that her eyes were open, what was intemperate and stubborn in her husband's conduct. He got over his violent fit of grief for his son, and was so borne along on another track, that, after a few years, he almost started when he found that his wife still hoarded a lock of soft, thin, flaxen hair, and still visited at set times a mound in the crowded churchyard. She said calmly and gently that it was no wonder that Septimus should partly forget ; it was a mercy that men did not feel exactly as women felt, for men had enough of other burdens. Septimus Fuller held his head erect, and was deter mined not to shut his shop with its liberal publications till he had spent his last penny. He was ready to starve with his wife. He did not mind though he were hustled in some of the Greenwich crowds in election times and at public rejoicings, particularly by the old pensioners, dockyard men, and naval tavern frequenters, who"], [283, "Endurance. 269 hated all dogmas except the dogma of obedience to the powers that be, and conceived that they had a special call to stand up to and pound a factious land-lubber in the noble cause of church and state. Septimus did not care though he saw his effigy in quaker-like hat, and shoes as quaker-like in their broad points, in checked neckerchief and coat with out a collar, set up beside the effigy of his wife in her light printed cotton gown, and a round cap, shading in an unsubstantial fashion a figure and face which were draggled and watery-looking in their old full comeliness. Septimus could stand the spectacle of these represen tatives, though the ugly mockery was followed by the uglier end of burning amidst howls and hootings. It is credible that Septimus could have borne greater extremities had they been tried. He might have endured to have had himself and his wife trodden to jelly in the mire, or their morsel of a house adjoining the shop set on fire as a den of pestilential treason, and the couple (for Septimus had no longer any reason to keep a shop boy) suffocated and roasted together like beasts of prey, with regard to which it is no cruelty to drag burning brushwood to the mouths of their holes, and to gloat over the enemies of men perishing without the chance of escape. Septimus held his head erect, and strode defiantly along the street. But his head was grey before its time, his gait was broken, and his back bent. Even his earnest, tenacious temper (he had never been cheerful and hopeful like Cassandra) had become morose and"], [284, "Endurance. 270 stern. This soured, almost monomaniacal man was nearly the sole associate of his more patient, more reasonable wife. Her patience found its perfection in her relation to him. \" I have nobody but Septimus to attend to,\" she said, taking pathetic comfort out of her losses, \"and he is so worthy of attention. I don't mean to say that he has been altogether right, or that he has made the people so much wiser and better by forcing on them knowledge, which they could not apprehend, and which most of them did not wish to have, about unfair taxes, iniquity in high places, sinecures in the offices of statesmen, and of beneficed clergymen who are not like my man, and who never think of their duty. The question is not of what is purely right, but of what Septimus believed to be right. For this he has given everything and borne every thing, and so taught the people a lesson of unworldliness, if naught else.\" Cassandra became very skilful in soothing her husband's asperity and cheering his gloom. Her great triumph was when she could entice him into a return to his old eagerness and energy. Every disappointment would then be forgotten. He would repeat eloquently his old, half-chimerical prophecies of free parliaments, cheap bread, universal knowledge, and, in the honest fire of his predictions, would half believe that they were already accomplished. \" Ay, Septimus,\" his confidante would echo his exulta tion. \" Please God, freedom, and plenty, and truth will reign one day, when there shall be an heap of corn in"], [285, "Endurance. 271 the earth high upon the hills,- and God's fruit shall shake like Libanus, and shall be green in the city like grass upon the earth.\" A sister of Mrs. Fuller's visited her towards the close of her life, and was disposed to lament bitterly her reduced circumstances. \" You never confessed to us how ill off you were, Cassie,\" complained the half-aggrieved prosperous kins woman. Cassandra stared in sheer amazement. \" 111 off ! sister. What do you mean ? What put such nonsense into your head ? I was never more comfortable in my life. We need so little, and it is so easy to do everything for one's self and one's husband, so much easier than directing, and keeping in order, and finding fault even with so good a servant as my old Molly.

LIVING CHARITY. \"She stretcheth out her hand to the poor ; yea, she reacheth forth her hands to the needy.\" ' I 'HE thirteenth chapter of First Corinthians gives ar. infinitely wider view of charity than that which is conveyed by the two commoner views of alms-giving and toleration. It seems to me that this chapter sums up the whole Christian life. Every duty, every engagement, may be discharged in the light of such charity. Therein is the losing one's life that one may save it, the being born again by the life and death of the Lord. This dying to one's self \u2014 to the vain strife of self-seeking, to the dreariness of worldly ambition and the irksomeness of conventionalities, as well as to the drudgery of compul sory obligation, is the great hope for man or woman, young or old. Only in youth, when every energy is yet buoyant, and the heart is full of expectation, before experience has come to teach us that there is but one salt to preserve every pleasure from palling, it is hard to believe that, without this solution, life is the saddest of unsatisfactory problems. But Christian men and women \u2022those of them who have really accepted Christianity \u2014 T"], [288, "Living Charity. 274 are not left to the old Greeks' mere mournful acquies cence in fate. Certainly, if we believed a part of our lite rature \u2014 our literature of the highest culture, we should be tempted to suppose that Christianity had drifted back into the old sense of hopeless helplessness. Mighty, im placable powers might be believed to baffle our bravest and most faithful efforts ; with no consolation possible beyond the vaguest notion of a goal of ultimate com pleteness and harmony to which our broken and jarring courses may tend. When so much of our more thoughtful literature has a deep undertone of sadness, verging on despair, no wonder that the reader rises from its classic pictures and delicately finished studies enervated and depressed, instead of being braced and strengthened for the rough yet breezy, sunlit road of life. The anti dote to such old foes of Christian faith lies in that omnipotent attribute good. The fight, however fierce, is a good fight. It has a meaning, and a good meaning, \u2014 an end, and that end the triumph of goodness. If it were not so, we might well be tempted to renounce Christianity altogether, and to return to the woefully brief conclu sions of the ancient pagan philosophers, as the best after all that man has arrived at, in his history of six thousand years. But vital charity is vital Christianity, and there may be something in it. There is surely something in that which can be said to have stood for ages the test of the most searching trials. It has sprung up afresh after the declension of centuries ; and this, not in the renewed wail of the natural man, but in echoing shouts of deliverance"], [289, "Living Charity. 275 raised by the spiritual man. Some of the wisest ai.d best of men have found in it sufficient explanation of the mystery of their destiny. Until to-day, far on in the nineteenth century, it has retained the same reality and potency which it possessed for St. Anthony, St. Simeon, and St. Francis, when they renounced their every worldly prospect and withdrew to the desert, to the sordidness and squalor of poverty. The man of society, of letters and clubs, will still renounce them all, and with them each prospect and scheme of his old life. He will sail for virgin soil and try Christianity yet once more, in a latter-day form, since he has quarrelled with all the earlier forms of this divine Christianity. \" Come and see,\" said the apostles to the men who doubted the Messiahship of the Master. \" Come,\" said the Master himself, and invited men to drink of the water of life. The water of life \u2014 for in Him was the verification and fulfilment of heathen myth and philosophic experiment, the draught which would give a new nature, a bloom as of amaranth to the spirit and the life of man, a clue to the labyrinth, a rod and staff for the dark valley, an inheritance and a possession among the many mansions of the Father's house. To do all things, the little as well as all the great things of life, in the charity of Christianity, is to dignify and en noble life, to re-create it, to bring it nigh to heaven, nay, to make it the very gate of heaven. And if to love God with all our hearts, and our neighbour as ourselves, because the Lord lived and died for all, sweetens and irradiates our whole intercourse and business with men, Uiere is a large ciass to whom our love is of special value T 2"], [290, "276 Living Charity. \u2014 those who are left, as it were, to our beneficence, and who will be with us always. The poor, under whatever poverty of bodily or mental affliction \u2014 worldly loss, infirmity, ignorance, and even under that most grievous poverty of sin \u2014 are our brethren, and we are here to do our best to make them better, in the Lord's name and for the Lord's sake. Our best may fail ; that is no matter of ours ; we can only try and try again, not knowing when and on whom the spirit may blow, stirring the dry and crumbling bones, only sure that they must be stirred in good time. It is hardly necessary to record of this living charity to the poor, that it is not wrought out by means of names in subscription lists representing sums however handsome, by crumbs from the rich man's table, or rags from his back. We must spare from our substance all that we can in this country and century of prodigious pauperism ; but the heart and soul of all undertakings must always con sist in personal sympathy and friendly intercourse. Charity working by proxy, or charity which waits till it is called on in an extremity, may alleviate some small pang of want, may be a drop of water among a thirsty multi tude to cool one tcngue ; but it is not living charity, and certainly it cannot be that charity which, like mercy, is twice blest, \" in him that gives and him that takes.\" It is impossible to conceive of a single individual so circumstanced that he or she cannot come in contact with one waif from the myriads of poor who is waiting to be solaced, if not to te relieved.

Notwithstanding this, it is sometimes the busiest who con trive to be most active in this department of charity. It appears to me that it is one of the peculiar privileges of women, above all of young women, in the present state of society, that they have often both leisure and opportunity at their disposal to be of essential sen-ice to the poor. All the poor may not be for their care. I doubt whether it is wise in the old to send the young, in the rawness of their simplicity, to the depraved, or even to the deeply afflicted, for the purpose of benefiting the sinners or the sufferers. The greatest danger to be feared is a kind of mutual imposition, an assumption of what is not so much as comprehended on either side. But to the orphan boy and girl, to the bedridden, honest old man or woman, however stupid and stolid, what woman or girl may not go, endeavouring in humility and tenderness to lighten the load and comfort the suffering? Doubtless here is work provided for many of those idle hours of which young women and girls complain. Here is a substitute for the trifling, mischievous pursuits, the gadding from house to house, the tale-bearing, the trying of morbid and foolish experiments on the characters and relations both of themselves and their neighbours, which girls allege they are driven to owing to utter lack of more interesting and satisfying employment to fill up their vacuity, if we are to credit their historians and prompters in light literature. At the same time such work has been brought into"], [292, "278 Living Charity. undeniable disrepute by the historians and prompters just referred to. The play and fashion of charity, taken up in idleness and curiosity as the favourite role of Lad) Bountiful, have evoked witty and well-bred sneers. As these are bestowed by lynx-eyed observers of \"life,\" they are without question deserved, and are not without their use. But do these clever satires exhaust the subject ? Are they not essentially superficial in their very class popularity ? Is charity in the hands of women, only, or even chiefly, administered by domineer ing middle age and coquettish youth, in each case with the main, if secret intent of ministering to the donor's pride and vanity? It is well to hold up a mirror which may reflect the follies of each generation. But are there only follies to be reflected ? Are follies the principal thing to be considered, after all ? Are satires to be our staple intellectual food ? On the contrary, is not the super fluity of satire eating out our faith and enthusiasm in all the great and good deeds of life ? Do we not eat out our own hearts when we give ourselves up to the politely cynical diet \u2014 bitter in its blandness ? I would record the law-ful warnings against girls engaging in the work of charity to the poor. Never let such charity take the psoce of the charity which begins at home. That is to drag charity into heavy disgrace. Never let charity to the poor supersede that charity which is the earning for one's self of an honest and honourable independence; the providing, as even a weak woman may, for the wants of her household. It is a sorry way of assisting the poor to suffer one's self to sink, more or less, into a gentle beggar."], [293, "Living Charity. 279 Take care of working for the poor in the world without, rather than of working in the homely domestic sphere which ought unmistakably to come first. Working for the general poor may afford more excitement and variety, but the charities of home are at once safer and more fruitful. Take care, again, of working for the poor in simple search of diversion and amusement. If the last be the motive, the work will be of a forced and desultory description \u2014 a mere mockery of work, and will without fail come to a speedy conclusion. The poor will be no better \u2014 rather the worse for this work : they will be affronted and aggrieved by such an artificial kind of work in their behalf. With their sharp eyes for selfish inducements, they may naturally come to regard their richer benefactors as being in this case the obliged persons \u2014 obliged to the poor who have consented to be bored and tormented, with some small remuneration, in order to afford, their richer brethren a credit account with their conscience, an object and an entertainment in life. The confident, careless girl or woman who plays at working for the poor as a sop for her conscience, or as a pastime, or a means of distinction, will be decidedly the worse for her ill-fulfilled mission. So for as women are concerned, the best safeguard against their adopting charity to the poor in lieu of tape trimmings and card playing, is to deepen and elevate their natures by practical Christianity. The second best preventive is to afford them a wider field for their unemployed energies, a virgin soil for their cramped, crushed talents."], [294, "280 Living Charity. \" A-WEARY.\" Tilly Bond came from a district of England where the Christian name of Elizabeth was once abbreviated and familiarised into Tilly. By-the-way, this fine name of Elizabeth has been more played upon and fondled by us, than any other name. We leave out of the category the Highland version Elspeth \u2014 recalling an old nurse with the second sight as one of her least gifts, and owning her own special diminutive titles of Eppie and Elsie. We still have Eliza, which is but an attempt to bring the comely stateliness of Elizabeth nearer to the tawdry finery of the Rosa-Matilda school. Then there is Bess, short and quaint; and Bessie, domestic and endearing. Betsy is a compound once tolerated in all ranks, but now reduced to hopeless vulgarity. Betty, of the Pope and Georgian era, is more coquettish in its quaintness than Bess. Lizzie has a Scotch ring, and a tendency to tack on to it Lindsay as a surname. Libbie is a humbler example of the Betsy type ; while Lisabee is a fantastic musical invention of the Norfolk and Suffolk downs ; and Bethia is a hard and stiff creation of the Scotch borders. But Tilly is a corruption of Elizabeth practised by no less an authority than Dr. Johnson towards the elderly vapouring wife at whom Davie Garrick laughed, yet whom Samuel Johnson never ceased to yearn after. Tilly Bond had enjoyed (!) a remarkably smooth, prosperous life. In the year 179- she came on a visit to"], [295, "Living Charity. 281 Greenwich, just for the sake of a little variety There was hardly a creature \u2014 let him be a toiling, starving workman (for what with war prices and bad harvests, toiling workmen were starving then), or a hunted aristocrat caught and caged like a wild beast in the choke-full French prisons over the water, or a suffering invalid tossing on a bed of pain \u2014 more sick at heart of every good under the sun, than Tilly Bond. It was not the restlessness of youth. She was no longer young, though she was still handsome. Neither could it be chagrin at remaining a single woman. With her fine person, and fine breeding, her good connections, and good fortune, she might still have married had she greatly cared to marry, or had any confidence that marriage would help her in getting rid of this fatal sense of the hollowness and emptiness of life. It seemed to her that most of the married women of her set were secretly as discontented and depressed as she was. The only difference was, that they had to bear the discontent and depression, or, what was still worse, the gross animal content and obtuse hilarity of others in addition to their own burden. For Tilly's part, she felt that she was weighted enough ; it required all her strength to drag her load along in decent silence. To do Tilly justice, she did not seek to cast her shadow over others. She had been passively and not actively selfish all her life, and she had too much honest pride to complain, when she had lived long enough to be certain that her life was a failure, nay, to suspect with a groan, that all lives were failures, save one life. In"], [296, "282 Living Charily. Tilly's perverted creed that one life was entirely separated from ordinary humanity save for its records, anil the doctrines and ordinances which were drawn from them \u2014 as completely separated as Tilly's actual life was from her baptism, confirmation, attendance at church, receiving the sacrament, reading the Bible and saying her prayers. There was an absolute divorce, which had not struck Tilly, between her own poor, palling or ferment ing worldliness, and Christ and Christianity. All that Tilly knew was that life had been tolerable to her when she was young. While in her health and high spirits, she had taken friends and sunshine very much as they came, giving nothing back, to be sure, except the shallow sparkle of her smile, the undaunted arbitrariness of her favours. Nothing more seemed to Tilly to have been required of her then, than to be lovely, light-hearted, and tolerably good-natured. No doubt such prettily convenient terms as those of \" butterfly queens \" and \" fairy princesses \" were not bandied about, exactly in the modern fashion, for the delight of a former read ing world. But that world still raved of Pope's Belinda, and moulded its fine women on the heathen model. In looking back upon that past life, it would shine out as positive happiness contrasted with the present. But sometimes when Tilly's eyes saw more clearly, she suspected that the past, at best, had been but pinch beck and tinsel, else it would not have grown dim and tarnished so soon. Yet, granting that this vanished happiness was no more than comparative, why should it come to an end by people growing old, as they could"], [297, "Living Charity. 283 not help growing? Where was the reason and justice of the sentence ? And Tilly was not so very old. There were no silver threads in her hair of browned flaxen tint like that of a fawn's coat. Her profile would still have been perfect in its Greek correctness, had not the mouth been drawn down by ennui, let her remain as silent as she would. Her tall, well proportioned figure was rather improved by the lack of any impetuosity in the gait. The coming haggardness and spareness which would be the bane of her fine looks were as yet barely discernible. Though Tilly was over thirty her beauty was very little impaired, as is the case with some women's beauty. New admirers were ready to substitute themselves, with tolerable rapidity, for the old ones who had passed out of her power and beyond her ken. The circle of her immediate friends was unbroken; the world not only of seed-time and harvest, but the social world of routs and drums, continued unchanged. Yet what although so much wore well and lasted, when other things did not, could not last, and when these were after all the main things ? The charm was gone, the spell was broken, departed with youth. The zest had vanished out of the half-frivolous, half-heavy, altogether self-seek ing life. Tilly could not be as she had been, or do as she had done. She had a keen perception of that fact. Had she been a woman less capable of better things, she had been without this perception, to her permanent blindness. It was all very well, in Tilly's half-opened eyes, for1 a girl of eighteen or twenty to have gone dancing along."], [298, "Living Charity. 284 nodding to her reflection in a mirror, mincing and bridling to every fresh partner whom she encountered on a ballroom floor, tripping and dancing to the edification and delight of her public, at rural fetes on the grass, at archery meetings, or at what were then called not picnics, but \" exploring parties,\" as if England had remained to be explored till that day I The last time Tilly was at Green wich, eight years before, she had caused her very horse to dance, as it caracoled with her on its back in mounted cavalcades, where she was the most handsome and spirited horsewoman. But a woman over thirty could not go on dancing through life, not even if she had the inclination. Tilly was not tempted to try the unnatural impropriety of persistent lightheartedness. She had not the inclina tion. Food, without savour, had soon grown distasteful to the appetite of which omnivorousness was only an early and temporary distinction. Neither had she an intellectual bent or artistic pursuit in which to take refuge, when the days came of which it could em phatically be said that she had no pleasure in them. Her mind had nothing creative in its quality ; she had been well-enough educated for her time and station ; but no branch of education had been more to her than means to an end \u2014 the desirable end of making her a fairly accomplished girl who could pass with credit in society. So a moderate acquaintance with English literature, the French language, with music, drawing, embroidery and dancing had been acquired, and had played their part in moulding the woman. Having moulded her, she had nothing more to do with them,"], [299, "Living Charity. 285 except languidly to take up a book, or a sheet of music, a pencil, or a needle, to serve as a dull make-shift for passing the time. As it was, it seemed to Tilly Bond a great mistake to grow old ; she did not know of what use growing old had been to her, unless as an inevitable declension, a sort of vengeance wreaked upon whatever flash there had been of anything too bright to linger in her life. The reader may observe that this notion fitted in very well with the old Greek theory of a baffling adverse fate with which universal man contends in vain, and to which the wise yield with a mournful, while lofty resignation. Indeed, though Tilly had not the modern Greco-English literature, any more than that other modern literature of deliberate worldly levity, for her study, she sang pagan lines in the style of \" Gather ye rose-buds while ye may,\" and conned pagan pages of old essays and sermons, not the less pagan that they were written in good English, and were sometimes furnished with verses of Scripture for texts. Tilly had come to Greenwich on this occasion for the sake of a little variety, but the variety was rapidly ex hausted. The dinners were substantially the same ; the suppers (people gave suppers as well as ate them, then) were the same ; the parade of society bore a striking resemblance ; the toasts and sentiments were as hack neyed. Worst of all, any admiration which Tilly excited \u25a0 \u2014 and she generally excited a good deal \u2014 was of an exactly similar description, and proved as great a bore to her at Greenwich as away in the country house which was her home, and the county set which was her set. There"], [300, "286 Living Charity. might have been a little novelty to begin with in Tilly's living in the Hospital, for she came to visit the Governor's family ; but any novelty wore off in no time. The broken bosky park was a wilderness to her, she grew sick of its huge sweet chestnuts and elms, its sandy hills and hollows, its observatory \" like a dog kennel,\" where a few men made a fuss about the stars which shone for every body. Tilly learnt to detest Vanbrugh Castle, with its towers and turrets, where heavy Sir John was flighty for once in his life. When she was just a little less tired of her own thoughts than of other people's talk, she \" sailed \" for exercise on a rainy afternoon up and down the painted hall, where the pensioners and officers of the Hospital no longer dined in common, and which was not then converted into a naval portrait gallery, but, like the whole Hospital now, was in a haunted and dreary state of disuse. She would look up at the grand cupola and wonder sardonically what William and Mary, Anne and Prince George'-, the painter Thornhill himself, and any other real person whom he had held worthy and had chosen to introduce on the ceiling, had ever done to sit aloft there amongst the gods and goddesses of mythology : surely human life was too dwarfing for such an association. She had almost ceased to believe in the heroic element in humanity. She questioned whether the weather-beaten veterans, reading the newspapers, and squabbling, and chewing their quids of tobacco on the benches outside, had ever done anything gallant that they could have helped doing, any more than some of them could have helped losing the arm or the leg which thev had lost."], [301, "Living Charity. 287 They took care that the world should know their loss, notwithstanding that they would have retained their limbs if they could. She had grown so incredulous, so impatient of heart as it were, though she was generally esteemed a quiet and courteous woman. Tilly had heard the extraordinary Greenwich legend, that Lady Jane Grey, in place of lying in her proper place at the Tower, sleeps below a nameless mound in the people's park. She could not even let Lady Jane, so young, so wise, and so unhappy, alone in her last bloody bed, whether in Greenwich Park or away on Tower Hill. She would have it that Lady Jane, with all her meekness, must have been exacting in her last tragic requirements, else so unlikely a tradition could never have arisen. And why should Lady Jane not have been exacting in the disposal of her body ? What was she, in plain speech, but a pragmatic tool of two ambitious men, her father and father-in-law, and of that silly youth her whining husband \u2014 a traitress against her cousin and lawful queen ? Tilly was to be pitied as well as Lady Jane \u2014 the victim of an old barbarous tragedy which has its compensations in the very pity and terror that the recollection of it awakens. A Lady Jane is not the only victim in this world. There are innumerable victims to their own low conceptions of their calling. There was no rousing current in Tilly Bond's life ; what was worse, there was hardly a grain of salt in it. The wonder was not that the life had grown stagnant, but rather that it had stopped short of corruption."], [302, "Living Charity. 288 \" Miss Bond,\" said the Governor's wife one lay, \" I shah be greatly indebted to you if you will make a call for me.* \" Surely ma'am,\" answered Tilly with a slight gape. One call more or less did not much signify to her, but she secretly hoped that she was to be sent among people whom other people knew, who had the entrance to Tilly's society. The Governor's wife had a visiting list of many columns, and among other weaknesses which were growing upon Tilly were a fretful exclusiveness and fastidiousness. \" I should just like you, my dear, to run up to Christi ana Apsley \u2014 Captain Apsley of the Dolphin's sister. Christiana is an easy, unaffected mortal, perfectly acces sible ; she is everybody's body in Greenwich, and her house is common ground.\" Tilly drew her shawl round her with an imperceptible restrictive motion. The description was not attractive. \" Tell Christiana I must have her opinion on my dinner to the Chatham people ; she need not stay herself unless she wishes it, but she must come over and tell me whether she thinks the bill of fare will suit, and if the seats are properly placed \u2014 I mean as to the men who are to fill them. Of course, you know, Miss Bond, that Christiana Apsley is in some anxiety about her brother Matthias, for the Dolphin has not been reported since last March, and she ought to have been heard of at Macao by this time.\" \"No, I did not know,\" answered Tilly, coolly enough; \" but will not a visit from a stranger be an intrusion under the circumstances?\" she proceeded to suggest"], [303, "Living Charity. 289 blandly. \" Pardon me, my dear ma'am, but don't you think Miss Apsley in her affliction cannot be expected to look after dinner dishes and seats?\" \" Dear ! it has not come to that,\" protested the Governor's wife, hastily. \" I did not say the ship was wrecked, only not spoken with for a month or two \u2014 not so rare a case with a vessel in some latitudes. I, for one, hope and trust that Captain Apsley will return and bring me the ivory combs that he promised me before winter \u2014 not that I care a straw for them.\" The worthy lady spoke a little indignantly, almost as if Tilly could have compassed by her remark the total foundering of the Dolphin with the loss of all hands. \" I'm sure I hope so too, since you wish it,\" agreed Tilly, with imperturbable politeness. \" There must be good reason to suppose that your expectations will be fulfilled, since Miss Apsley takes her brother's disappear ance so quietly.\" \" You are farther wrong than ever, Miss Bond, if you mean by that remark that Christiana Apsley and the Captain are not an attached sister and brother \u2014 why, not a young or an old couple in the place are fonder or more faithful to each other than that pair.\" The Governor's wife was quite red in the face at this point in the con versation. \" My dear ma'am,\" Tilly sought to mollify the speake; again, for she had really some regard for an old friend, \" I am fully convinced that .all the men of your acquaint ance are as brave as the Governor, and all the women a ; kind as vourself.\" u"], [304, "Living Charity. 290 \"Ah! that is all very well, Miss Bond,\" owned the aggrieved woman, slightly softened, \" but you do not know Christiana Apsley.\" \" Nor do I care to know her, you good old goose,\" Tilly was guilty of saying to herself; while her friend said to herself, in a discomfited state of feeling, \" I do not know what has come over Tilly Bond ; I used to think her a sweet pretty creature, but now she seems a mere fine lady. I'm vexed I have sent her to turn up her nose at Christiana, only Christiana may do even a fine lady good.\" Miss Apsley lived in a tall narrow house on the verge of Blackheath. Tilly Bond paid little heed to the wind swept heath, which retained then in many places its ancient thick cover of furze and gorse, as it stretched away to Shooter's Hill. She was spiritually choking even with a horizon so wide and free that nothing save a sea-border was equal to it. The clouds sailed in the sky above the heath and were reflected in dappled shadows on its broad surface, as the clouds sail over the face of the sea and are reflected on it. There were blushing sunsets there which crimsoned an uninterrupted plain of earth and sky for miles and miles. There were moonlights which flooded a territory of their own, unoccupied, when the footpads were not out, except by linnet and lapwing, and rabbit. It was wild, and still and hoary as moonlit territory should be. The freshness of the heath, glitter ing like silver and sown thick with pearls in the early morning, was the freshness of the virgin wilderness. But the heath was as ploughed fields, or sunk lanes, or even"], [305, "Living Charity. 291 as labyrinths of houses to Tilly. Of course she had heard of the robberies committed there, and they were not agreeable subjects of consideration, though really she did not mind them much in her present frame of spirit. Almost anything would have been welcome for a change. If Tilly had ever listened to annals of Joan of Kent, of Wat Tyler, or of King Hal with any or all of his wives, she had forgotten, in her prevailing indifference, person ages who were buckram if not prunella to her in their out of-date habits. Miss Apsley's was an unpretending house among the sprinkling of large houses of red or yellow brick, or white painted houses, with peaked sogades, steep roofs, and fine stacks of chimneys, which marked the neighbour hood. It had no claims even to picturesqueness, and was lamentably destitute of space. But it was not with out a quaint uprightness and an honest coming to the light and air. Every tiny cabin-like room (and the rooms were all of the same size) had a couple of windows, slim, in the style of the house. The very stair, which went up in the most straightforward manner, in the centre of the house, had a window on each of the landing places. All the windows had high window seats, and these too were ship-like. Christiana called them \" bunkers,\" though they did not open, and therefore contained no stores. The only approach to picturesque ness lay in the hardy homely flowers and herbs, the honeysuckle, the red June roses, small but dainty, the white daisies, the trailing wreaths and yellow stars of creeping jenny, and the sweet marjoram and basil which u 2"], [306, "Living Charity. 292 flourished in the morsel of ground within the paling before the house. Christiana Apsley loved flowers as she loved every living thing, and somehow the flowers would spring beneath her footsteps wherever she went, and be induced to tarry in the most unlikely places, as if she carried fairy flower-seed in her slippers. There was proof positive that Christiana's narrow house did not symbolize a narrow heart on the part of its mistress. On the contrary, Christiana's heart effected a magical expanding influence on her house. Evidence of this was afforded by the circumstance, that when Tilly Bond stepped softly up and knocked at Miss Apsley's door, a mingled din was issuing from the open windows. Only in wintry weather did Christiana Apsley keep her windows shut ; otherwise, her friendly satirists (she had just a few enemies) asserted that her overflowing house would have certainly burst, and its multifarious contents been scattered to the ends of the heath. The sounds which greeted Tilly's sensitive ears were the shrill singing of Christiana's bird ; the gruff barking of Christiana's dog; the lively gossiping of Christiana's maid with an old Greenwich pensioner on the area stair (for Christiana's house was furnished with an area stair and door, and a back stair and door of doll's dimensions) ; the merry laughter and chatter of some young cousins \u2014 girls lately emancipated from school, and boys in the mongrel cur stage of an upper school uniform ; and lastly Christiana's somewhat bass voice endeavouring to make itself heard. Tilly was nearly driven back in distraction and"], [307, "Living Charity. 293 disgust. She hated noise \u2014 vulgar noise. She was able to endure the rattle of carriage wheels, and the medley of street cries, when she was in town. She could put up with the full chorus or the crashing band at an opera or assembly, with the beat of feet, the muffled clack of dowagers' tongues, or the hoarse murmur of male voices in a drawing-room. Even the scream of a macaw or the yelp of a lap-dog, introduced as a privileged inmate in a privileged locality, did not disconcert her. She was accustomed to these sounds; she believed they were of some, though not of much value to her. Sickeningly dull as her life was with their accompaniment, she believed that it might be still duller without some such accompaniment. But this uncalled-for hubbub, including the piping of a common bird, the barking of a common dog, the cockney jargon of a maid of all work, together with the naval jargon of an old \" man-o'-war,\" the giggles of monkeys of girls, and the growls of cubs of boys, wound up by the stentorian voice of a woman so lost to delicacy and dignity that she could tolerate the uproar and strive to talk it down, was wholly distasteful and almost unbearable to Tilly. She shrank from the trials of such an encounter. But she might overlook bird and beast, and she would get quit of the maid and her crony. Miss Apsley was a naval officer's sister and a friend of the Governor's wife, and however homely, might retain a remnant of ladylike consciousness so as to recognise a lady in Tilly Bond, and behave like a lady to her. The very boys in their hobbledehoy uniform might be tolerated, because the rudest boys were embryo admirers"], [308, "Living Charily. 294 of a woman like Tilly Bond ; and in her hopeless ennui it sometimes amused her a little to twist the young fellows round her fingers. Her pet aversion was girls \u2014 girls with sharp eyes to detect incipient wrinkles, and sharp tongues to turn these wrinkles into ridicule, anil with simpers or pouts to attract attention on their own account. But girls, immensely inferior to Tilly Bond in every other respect, were her acknowledged unde niable superiors in this, that they were only entering on the sway and sovereignty which she was relinquishing, because she had so for undergone that most undesirable process of growing old. She had entered on her third lustre, and any sunshine of good which she had been able to see, since her feet had trodden the fields of this world, was fast waning and setting, while some higher voice still struggling within her prevented her from taking refuge in growing grossness, arrogance, avarice, and utter heartlessness. But oh ! how Tilly's sore heart hated young girls, in so far as her weary misspent nature could hate anything ! Tilly could not have drawn back, even at the last moment, though she would. Christiana Apsley, not withstanding she was always professing that she was a little deaf in such a noisy house as hers, detected Tilly's knock and had her shown into one of the rooms, with chintz hangings and cane-bottomed chairs. Christiana's rooms were all much the same, save for the presence or absence of the smallest beds fit for grown-up persons to stretch themselves upon. Christiana could not afford supernumerary furniture in the space that was too small for"], [309, "Living Charity. 295 her flow of company. She accommodated her brother when he was at home, and frequently brother officers of his who were on shore and yet not near their own family, or not so fortunate as to have a family to whom they could go. But all sailors were so handy in stowing themselves into infinitesimal quarters, and in improvising conveniences in the shape of shelves and boxes, that Miss Apsley protested that, in her happy experience, it was the simplest matter in the world to play the hostess to them. When Captain Apsley was with his ship, there were always country cousins and old neighbours looking Christiana up, for she had not been a Greenwich woman all her life. These were entertained by her to her last penny, though not beyond it. Christiana was quick enough to take poor weary Tilly Bond's measure at the first glance, and she was willing to do as she would be done by. She meant to take Tilly Bond apart into one of the chintz bowers, and to screen her as much as possible from all that would offend her. Christ iana would hear her errand, and send her on her way back to the Governor's if not rejoicing, at least not scandalised, or exasperated in her languidness. But the fates were against Christiana ; or else a providence was watching over Tilly Bond that day. She had come to Miss Apsley's \u2014 there was no name to the house, for everybody about Greenwich knew Christiana Apsley's without the need of further designation \u2014 at an orthodox calling hour. But all hours were alike to a woman of Christiana's popularity, while her callers were by no"], [310, "296 Living Charity. means of an orthodox description. As she would not deny the more pressing claims of her other friends in order to satisfy a fine lady's fastidiousness, Tilly had to sit disconsolate and disdainful, and take her turn in the panorama which unfolded itself before Christiana Apsley. To begin with the one stationary figure fo its comely sobriety of garment and unmistakable cap on its un varnished grey hair, whatever Christiana Apsley might have been in the days of her youth, not a human being with a heart could look in her face now, and call it \"painfully\" or \"hideously \" plain. However rough the skin or irregular the features, there was so much heart there, that it sat on the brow, in the eyes, and especially in the mouth \u2014 that feature which more than any other feature is moulded by character and life. I have spoken and am going to speak a good word for tho mouths of many of the women of that district of Kent and of that era ; but none of them all was so perfectly peaceful, such a home of benevolence as Christiana Apsley's mouth, at her age. She was not far beyond the trying period of middle life, not so very much older than Tilly Bond ; but in the purely outward aspect Christiana had not worn nearly so well. What says the German proverb ? \" Weeds wear well.\" And this cheerful kindly woman, with innumerable interests, who listened to every one, and heard many a tale, had suffered great trials and sustained heavy losses. She had worked for bread under greater disadvantages than Margaiet Copeland had worked. Margaret had duly seen her friends, first and last, go forth at her bidding"], [311, "Living Charity. 297 into the world, where she had helped them to prosper, and from which she had constant tidings of them. Christiana had parted on this side time from a precious host of near and dear kindred, who had left her one by one, in obedience to a summons that would not brook denying. She had not formed fresh ties. She was still in care and trouble on account of the one dear man who was spared to her. Had not Captain Apsley's ship failed to be spoken with since the month of March \u2014 a year back ? Little marvel that Christiana's hair was grey, and her cheeks furrowed, though the spirit within her was fed from sources which no tribulation could drain \u2014 to which tribulation only added its choice nourish ment \u2014 so that the spirit was green and fresh and capable of gladness, as in the days of her youth. The first scene of the panorama which passed before Tilly Bond as she sat passive in one of the chintz bowers, was the departure of several of the young country cousins, who had been holding high revel in another of the chintz bowers. These hoydens had to kiss and hug Miss Apsley, and be kissed and hugged by her in turn. She had to examine them on the question of wraps ; supply them with after-thoughts for their comfort and satisfaction ; send messages by them to their relations. Withal Miss Apsley's house was so small that all its transactions, whether they were conducted in one chintz bower or another, became of necessity public property. \" Corne soon and see us, cousin,\" the girls called heartily at parting ; \" we are coming soon back to see you again.\" \"Do so, my dears; I'll like nothing better.\" Miss"], [312, "Living Charity. 298 Apsley thus gave the girls more than leave, explaining afterwards to Miss Bond, \" They make a stir about the house, and that is pleasant to me ; I was used to a stirring house, there were so many of us when I was young. The girls like to come here for a change ; girls like a change, you know, Miss Bond; but I think these girls must be very affectionate, poor things, to care to be with a middle aged woman like me. I do try to make the house agreeable to them ; it is the little I can do for my young friends, and it is sometimes an advantage for them to have friendly quarters at their service here. The Uptons have been seeing their brother off in the Spits re; and Fanny Rushworth is waiting for her father. The girls' spirits get up when they are together with some of their brothers,\" Christiana ended, apologetically. \" So I could hear,\" remarked Miss Bond, with a quiet ness which was reproachful. \" I do not think it is right to damp young people with older people's fears\u2014 mere fears which we are so apt to indulge in,\" repeated Miss Apsley, half stoutly, half with a little nervous constraint in her voice. \" It is time enough to moan when misfortunes really come ; and God knows they will come soon enough to the most thoughtless girl or boy.\" \" Very likely,\" answered Miss Bond, indifferently, nay, with a certain spiteful self-congratulation in her well modulated voice. \" However, I think boys and girls have a very good time of it,\" she wound up with an envious note. \"But of course not so good a time as we who are"], [313, "Living Charity. 299 older have,\" amended Christiana, with undoubting con viction. \" It is such a comfort to know our own minds, *o have gained experience, to feel that our faith is some thing like faith.\" Before Tilly Bond could do more than stare, and wonder whether Miss Apsley was a hypocrite, or a Methodist, or both, the second act of the panorama was displayed. Miss Apsley's servant, unaccustomed to say that her mistress was too much engaged to see an additional visitor, had obeyed another tap at the knocker, and she was now heard ushering in another visitor. \" It is lucky that there are no secrets in this house \u2014 there could not be,\" said Christiana Apsley, quite con tented with the local incapacity for secrets. \" Excuse me, Miss Bond, I think I distinguish the voice of an old friend, whose mother is bedridden, and who only gets out herself for five minutes' exercise and relaxation. Middle aged people need less variety than girls, but one would not like to deprive them of their five minutes' movement, especially when they have earned it so well as my friend has earned hers. Can your errand wait, Miss Bond ?\" Tilly, who had half the day before her, was at least too well bred to say that her errand could not wait. The woman whom Christiana Apsley had twice named emphatically her friend was a shabby, dowdy, neutral tinted woman, whom Tilly would have been ashamed to own anywhere. During the most of the time the stranger remained she talked of her old mother in a monotonous absorbed voice \u2014 of the amount of time the invalid had"], [314, "Living Charity. 300 slept the previous night, what food she had taken for breakfast and dinner, what food she might take for supper, and the extent to which she might be expected to sleep during the next night. Christiana Apsley listened with un affected interest, and offered thoughtful suggestions, as if she had studied the subject, and as if it were of para mount importance to her also. \"You are amazingly good, Miss Apsley,\" Tilly Bond took the liberty of saying, not without a suspicion of a sneer, when the five minutes were at an end, and this specimen of a Cinderella had disappeared; \"you have sacrificed five minutes, and your friend might as well have been at home for the amount of new ground she has gone over.\" \" I am not amazingly good,\" answered Christiana, bluntly, in her deepest voice. \" I had the privilege of having an old mother of my own once. We all had or have mothers. It is a relief to my friend to go over the business of her life to me, though she cannot go away entirely from it, not for five minutes, and would not wish to do so if she could.\" \" But ought one never to think of one's self? Is there no duty one owes to one's self?\" inquired Tilly, with as much scorn and asperity as if she derived the utmost satisfaction from doing her duty by herself. \"My dear,\" answered Miss Apsley, with a broadening smile, for the question struck her as too comical to be replied to quite gravely. But she took herself back the next moment and explained that she had fallen into a bad habit of saying \" My dear \" w-ith speaking often to"], [315, "Living Charity. 301 girls. She would not wilfully indulge in such un becoming familiarity with Miss Bond. \" Oh ! never mind, Miss Apsley,\" retorted Tilly, growing as brusque as Miss Apsley ; \" answer me.\" \" I meant to say that I have always found that I do my duty to myself best when I forget myself altogether. Oh, dear ! Miss Bond, I am trespassing on your patience a great deal too far. There is old Black Tom,\" she said, hurriedly, indicating through a window an amalgamation of ebony and white cotton entering by the little gate ; \" I forgot that I had appointed him to come at this hour to get the flannel and the medicine. I am afraid that I have not sufficient method,\" continued Christiana, peni tently ; \" besides interruptions will occur and overthrow the little method I can boast of \u2014 no, don't consider yourself an interruption \u2014 how rude I am ! but not so rude as that \u2014 or only a very pleasant interruption, indeed, you are, Miss Bond ; it is a treat to me to see so perfectly appointed a lady, if you will forgive me for saying so. But now allow me to guess that Mrs. Ludlow wishes to see me about the annual Chatham dinner. Just mention the day ; I was not aware that it was fixed, and I'll look in at the Hospital before then, so that I need not detain you farther.\" \" If you please to allow me to sit out the rest of your visitors for the afternoon \u2014 you said you had no secrets,\" Tilly suddenly proposed. A flush, part shame, part hope, which had been all but extinct, faintly rose on her face once more. \" I should like it \u2014 I cannot tell what has come over me, but there is enough grace in me to wish to witness the rest of your doings this afternoon.\""], [316, "Living Charity. 302 Miss Apsley made no objection, though she was a little puzzled and put out. There was nothing to witness in her doings; and for a sine lady like Miss Bond to sit and play with her solitaire and look on and listen was both absurd and trying. Nevertheless, if a sine lady liked, Miss Apsley need not baulk her of a trifling diversion. Tilly Bond saw Christiana Apsley assist Black Tom from her modest stores. And not only did she assist him, she conversed with him, as friend with friend, although he was a Malay cook, and she an officer's sister. All the while Miss Apsley did not descend a step from her proper position, nor did Black Tom ascend a step from his. Tilly Bond saw other Black Toms, unlike the first only in being white and not black recipients of such aid as Miss Apsley could afford them. Some times it was no more than a bit of cold mutton, a yard or two of calicot, the pattern of a gown, or the scroll of a letter; but it was always given willingly and intelligently. Tilly encountered more humdrum old friends ; more of her own enemies, the heedless young girls ; an elderly man or two ; a batch of boys all pressing into the small house to recount their troubles or their triumphs, and either way, to be welcome and to have what they sought for \u2014 fellow-feeling, whether of condolence or congratula tion. One or two individuals dropped in to ascertain how Christiana herself fared, and to inquire if she had heard tidings of her brother. But these were soon answered; for Christiana had not much to say of herself, and she could not expatiate on her own troubles, she"], [317, "Living Charity. 303 could just trust herself to wax confidential on what proved a kindred topic. \" I'll tell you how I came to take up with Black Tom. He reminds me of Tom Rose. Ah ! you never heard 01 Tom Rose, or he has gone out of your head. He was the Malay who was out in the Antelope with Captain Wilson when he was wrecked on the Pelew Islands, and Tom Rose became an interpreter through the other Malay who had been providentially wrecked at the same place a period of years earlier, and had lived long enough with the islanders to pick up their gibberish. The Pelew islanders were very kind to our folk in distress,\" con cluded Miss Apsley, abruptly, yet wistfully, as if she thought of another ship that might be in a strait, and in sore need of such for away kindness. \" They were South Sea savages, were they not ?' demanded Tilly Bond. \" Yes,\" accorded Miss Apsley, simply ; \" and one might not have expected much from savages ; but these were as nice a set of savages as one could hope to find. I used to be about Rotherhithe in those days, and I saw poor young Prince Lee Boo, who was so ardent in the acquisition of knowledge to take home for the benefit of his father and people, and so uncomplaining when he had to die in a strange land and leave all his knowledge behind him \u2014 where it could benefit nobody, as it seemed, far out of the reach of the Pelew islanders. Prince Lee Boo was taken away from the whole fresh world opening up to him.\" \"I could envy that black boy,\" cried Tilly in excite-"], [318, "Living Charily 304 raent ; \" I would give much to have a fresh world open up to me, even for a few months.\" \" My dear,\" said Christiana Apsley, without qualifying the use of the adjective this time, \"do you not think our little world of Great Britain is full of marvels, and that we will never get to the end of them so long as we live ? We are always entering on fresh worlds, if we will but open our eyes to see them. We are perpetually break ing fresh ground in matter and spirit, in companionship, in thought and feeling. Suffering even, though flesh and blood rebel against it, makes us richer by new regions, the highest regions of all, because they are so dearly bought.

Will you teach me to forget myself? Will you give me the hardest things to do, that I may feel so unlike my old self, I shall know I have entered on another state?\" \" Only One can do that for you, and it is not I, madam,\" replied Christiana, gently and reverently ; \" but I'll show you all I can, and I'll go with you to the Hospital this very minute, where you'll show me that you are in earnest in being tired to death of being a fine lady (I believe you are, poor soul !) by helping me and the Governor's wife to calculate the dishes and the seats for the Chatham dinner,\" ended practical, sensible, humorous Christiana."], [319, "Living Charity. 305 \" I'll do anything that I am bidden, which it is right to do ; and I know that you'll not ask me to do what is wrong,\" Tilly pledged herself solemnly. \" But how do you find time for all you've got to do?\" she suggested, wonderingly. \"Things fit in, somehow, and I get through,\" Miss Apsley assured her listener, cheerily. \" Why, last night I had a quarter of an hour to spare to admire the moon. Did you see the moon last night, Miss Bond ? and don't you think the moon grows bonnier and bonnier ?\" \" I sat and stared at it for two hours, Miss Apsley, and I did not see it after all ; at least I only remember I wondered that it looked down on such a poor affair of a world as this. But when you've helped me to find new worlds, perhaps I shall find new moons too. Only remember, Miss Apsley, that you must apprentice me to your hardest work,\" insisted Tilly, with almost a fierce accent in her earnestness, \" that there may be the broadest distinction between my past and my present, for I want that.\" It seemed true that Tilly Bond wanted extreme tasks to confirm her in living charity, for she long held to them, before she would turn to pleasanter lines. She would seek out the lowest dregs of old watermen and their wives, who would take her help and then snap their fingers at her and curse her ; and then she would try to teach the most befouled little children grown old in cunning and hard-heartedness, who would fawn upon and mock her.

BOUNTY, DIGNITY, AND DAINTINESS. ' ' She is not afraid of the snow for her household ; for all her household are clothed with scarlet. \" She maketh herself coverings of tapestry ; her clothing is silk and purple.\" T'HERE is a religion which is austere and ascetic. There is a second religion which is essentially worldly in its godliness. There is yet a third religion, which teaches that neither of the former is the true religion of Christ. The first affects to wear a garment of camel's hair, and a leathern girdle about its loins. It frowns on all pleasure, whether of the body, of the mind, or of the \u00e6sthetic taste. Nay, it even looks askance at kindly human nature rejoicing in the happiness of its kind. Such a religion is a monstrous as well as morose travesty of the precepts of the most human, because divinely human, of men, who looked abroad among simple men, women, and children for examples by which to point his lessons. He recalled King Solomon and referred to his glory, not depreciatingly, by declaring that a flower of the field excelled that glory. The Lord cited the Queen of Sheba, and praised her, because according to her light she did well, and would rise in ?\u00a3 2"], [322, "308 Bounty, Dignity, and Daintiness. judgment against another generation that had no thirsv after knowledge to bring to Him to be quenched. He in whom the sense of fitness and significance dwelt in perfection, did not despise or condemn the polished stones of the Temple \u2014 not even the purple and sine linen of Dives, though He used them to remind His disciples of truths greater and more lasting than any principle of \u00e6sthetics. He showed them that the costly stones of the Temple must give place to a temple not made with hands ; and that the rich man's luxuries, which were his sole goods for time and for eternity, were as dust in the balance when weighed against the claims of the beggar whom the dogs loved. The Lord com mended the breaking of the alabaster box of ointment in His service, even as He commended the giving of a cup of cold water in the name of a disciple. When God consents to take of His own \u2014 in such majesty and bounty as man's fancy can devise and his skill can compass \u2014 He does not deny to man, who is lord of God's creation, the exercise of his faculties on his own behalf. God has implanted in man's inmost nature a love of the beautiful, a per ception of the suitable, an instinct which allots to each man his surroundings according to his possessions. No doubt these primary laws are continually sinned against ; nevertheless they lie at the root of all proper grandeur of lodging, sumptuousness of clothing, all right grace and charm of life; and it is exactly as these laws have been remembered, adhered to, and kept in abeyance under still higher laws, that bounty, dignity, and dainti-"], [323, "Bounty, Dignity, and Daintiness. 309 ness are admissible \u2014 nay, most desirable and worthy of admiration \u2014 in the Christian world. Of course, there are seasons of national and family distress and suffering, when all that pertains to outward show of tapestry and fine linen is out of place ; but the exceptions do not invalidate the rule. The Christianity which sternly sets its face against bounty, dignity, and daintiness must be prepared to renounce the inspiration and authority of the Wise King, when he included among the excellences of the virtuous woman the fact that she clothed her household in scarlet, and made for herself coverings of tapestry and fine linen. The same Christianity must also deny all meaning to the assurance that Wisdom is justified in all her children. The godliness which is essentially worldly owes some thing of its desperate taint to the utter misunderstanding of these primary laws of beauty and suitability, to the setting of such laws at naught, and to the confusion and disorder implied in the spiritual condition which exalts these laws over yet higher laws. A great architect and painter will tell his school that there can be no real merit and abiding joy in an edifice or picture which is not true \u2014 true in its lines, its pro portions, its drawing, its building. So entirely does falseness compromise and condemn the work, that any other advantage it may claim of lofty or picturesque form, of mellow or tender colouring, of delicate or gorgeous ornament, becomes spoilt to integrity of eye. It becomes oositively meretricious and repulsive, by reason of the"], [324, "Bounty, Dignity, and Daintiness. 310 falseness which it illustrates. The same reasoning holds good, though unfortunately it is not so widely ac knowledged, in that department of art which is literature. All falseness to the highest moral standard, as well as to nature, in writing history, poetry, or fiction, is so far fatal to every achievement as a work of art In the same way, you young girls and women ought to know that over your habits, your toilets, your houses, where you have the ordering of houses, bounty, dignity, and daintiness can only preside with power so long as they are consistent with truth. Every practice of free expenditure in which you indulge, and which you may per haps call open-heartedness and open-handedness, must be weighed in this balance. Such practices may be liberality in a rich man's daughter or wife, or in the heiress to a fortune, and may benefit her \u2014 provided she will use and not abuse her gift, regarding it at best as being only a trust and an attribute. But the same practices in the daughter of a poor man are only the indulgence of gross selfishness, little short of dishonesty. They are sheer folly and wanton improvidence in a woman labouring for her bread, and earning the money which she recklessly throws away without laying up a store for her future. The world is everywhere full of compensations, except for sin. There is a noble beauty in economy as there is in liberality. For that matter, there are innumerable circumstances where economy is synonymous with liberality, and where in order to be liberal and generous you girls and women must be economical. You must not run far and wide, and grasp at the mirage of"], [325, "Bounty, Dignity, and Daintiness. 311 bargains \u2014 you must be ready to pay the tradesman his due, and the working woman her hire, as well as to add the Good Samaritan's two pence to the earnings of the hard-toiled and poorly paid, or to bestow the pence freely on the helpless sufferer who has fallen among thieves. But in order to do the last, you must begin by foregoing the lavish, unnecessary expenditure of more than two pence, by saving the pence ana having them by you when the occasion comes for spending them. You may say that it is too difficult a task for you to discern between waste and liberality, as it is too hard an undertaking for you to decide between the deserving and the undeserving ; but that is just what you are called upon to do, and to spare no pains in learning to do, if you would be the children of the Just One \u2014 if you would shed blessings, and not curses, around you in this world. No sooner is the foundation of suitability laid, than women are at liberty, are enjoined, to build upon it the superstructure of bounty, dignity, and daintiness. Do not let any girl dream that such a building is con temptible, or fear that it is beneath the consideration of a rational creature. It is true that the Apostle Paul forbade women's adorning to be merely outward, and directed them to a nobler adorning. But the for bidding of the abuse was no condemnation of the use of adornment. On the contrary, like the Lord's analogy between Solomon's glory and the far higher glory of the lilies of the field, St. Paul, while he is discouraging excess in such ornaments, in a certain sense commends the brilliant and refined ornaments of gold, and pearls,"], [326, "Bounty, Dignity, and Daintiness. 312 and broidered hair, as he turns from them by a direct inference to the infinitely transcending attraction of good works. If nothing in God's universe is common and unclean, is it not meet that women should take care that their surroundings, which include a portion of their empire, be seemly and winning ? Only remember that the things which are seen and temporal, are but types, and changing types, of the things which are unseen and eternal. Happily, bounty, dignity, and daintiness are relative terms, and are by no means confined to one class and con dition, or limited to one superlative degree of excellence. Bounty may be dispensed in a cottage as well as in a palace. There is dignity in cotton, as there is dignity in velvet. Daintiness may be maintained by the help of a service of earthenware, as well as by the help of a service of marble or porcelain. Here, again, the principle of compensation comes in. Along with sufficient refinement, bred of education and competence, there is a bright sociality and a home simplicity in the country retreat of the merchant, the snug seat of the small squire, the rectory, or the vicarage. Men miss these in the hall and the castle of the millionaire and the nobleman, quite as much as men miss space and state and treasures of art from the smaller houses. Descending still in the social scale, the house in the street of the country town, and the very cottage of the peasant, have often a cosy compactness and a sweet rusticity which evade houses but a little removed from them in status."], [327, "Bounty, Dignity, and Daintiness. 313 So that men and women be pure and kind, reverent and tender, the homes which will reflect their occupants' natures will also, if the occupants so choose it, reflect their graces. Each home will do this according to its kind, not vying with other kinds, but preserving its distinct individuality, and its own unapproachable merit. The daisy not only can exist in the same world with the rose, but there are actually elements of delight in the daisy which belong to it, and to it alone, and which the rose must leave out in the summing up of her perfections. The great essential is that the daisy grow in the daisy's turf, the rose in the rose's garden. Men and women may \u2014 nay, they sometimes must \u2014 rise in rank and pass into different circles, with altered pursuits ; and sometimes the germ of this necessity is visible in the nature of the immature man and woman. There is thus presented the anomaly of men and women who seem born with tastes above their stations. But where the anomaly is real, it is generally a case of coming events casting their shadows before. In spite of the anomaly, there need be no envying and striving for place on God's earth, if men and women would only believe it. A girl's ways, her work, her dress, and amusements can only become her in so far as they are hers by right, and not by assumption. Being hers, they will surely become her, if she will only be wise, and content to exercise upon them her womanly skill and what cultivation her taste has acquired. A girl in a printed calico or a brown holland and coarse straw bonnet, may be more nicely (that is, more fitly) dressed than the same girl in silk and lace"], [328, "Bounty, Dignity, and Daintiness. 314 fabrics. What is more, for the girl's innocent consolation, the printed calico or the brown holland and coarse straw have a beauty of their own, which the silk and lace want. Of course, on the other hand, the silk and lace have advantages which the calico and straw cannot command ; and so the justice of the award is rendered equal. I have heard ladies praise the modest, becoming dress of their neat and tidy housemaids, and wish, almost longingly, that the mistresses could lay their heads together and assume such another dress as that which the servants are foolish enough to despise, while they seek to exchange it for coarse finery. But here the mistresses are wrong in their turn. The dress which becomes the servants would change its character the moment that it was worn by the mistresses. It would cease to be modest, quiet, and tasteful. It would be no better than a piece of stagey affectation. Let the mistress's dress be modest and becoming in its kind ; but let it be a dress after the fashion of mistresses' dresses. Class is not the only question which has to do with bounty, dignity, and daintiness in their fit development, though it is an important question in more lights than one. There are questions of the suitability of the sur roundings to age, to size, to complexion, above all, to individuality. Suitability to climate, to the neighbourhood, and to the household, has likewise to be considered. There are also great fixed laws of harmony, and from these no discordant practice, however universal in the world around, can justify the broad departure. But the field is far too"], [329, "Bounty, Dignity, and Daintiness. 315 wide for present discussion ; and it is one that every woman who seeks to be well equipped for the encounters of life, must master for herself. Enough to say, no woman or girl can be well surrounded and clad, unless she is surrounded and clad in keeping with her character and position. No more can any girl or woman entertain herself well, whether in studying Greek or Latin, or in playing croquet, in riding and dancing, or in cooking and stitching, if these occupations and entertainments are not hers, not merely on the ground of talent and taste, but of propriety and duty. Granted this, there is no harm, there is great good, in the woman or girl being as boun tiful, as dignified, as dainty as she can succeed in being. The attainment is then a species of thanksgiving, a source of refinement and a perfectly lawful pleasure. After all, little injunction is needed to induce a true girl or woman, unless she may have been blinded or crushed by a false education, to cultivate bounty, dignity, and daintiness. These qualities belong to womanliness, are among its most sacred traditions and cherished instincts. It is only when womanliness itself is more or less stamped out, that the wreck of the woman ceases to care to give good things, is insolently or cravenly mean, and waxes slovenly and squalid. \u2014 .*o*~\u2014"], [330, "316 Bounty, Dignity, and Daintiness BENNET LE STRANGE. /^\\F all the women who graced Greenwich and its neighbourhood a century back, Bennet Le Strange was the finest lady and the loveliest woman ; she had the most charming house, and gave the most delightful parties. All the fascinations of her presence and management were entirely Bennet's own doing. She was left early a childless widow, and spent her considerable income according to her own will and judgment. She had Miss Le Strange, her husband's sister, to live with her; but Miss Le Strange, though she could not in conscience avoid criticising the conduct of the sister-in law of whom she was fond, did not attempt to exercise any control over Bennet's actions. Indeed, Bennet was one of those soft creatures who have yet back bone in their constitution. She might be influenced, but she would not be controlled, save by those who had a title to control her. Hardly any one who was not harsh and malicious could have accused Bennet Le Strange of downrightly misspending the talents which she had received. And Miss Le Strange was not harsh and malicious. She was a good woman of her kind, deservedly respected and liked by those who knew her. Bennet also was a good woman, and loved to distraction by her circle. Every relation of life which Bennet had filled she had filled with credit. She had been a good daughter, wife,"], [331, "Bounty, Dignity, and Daintiness. 317 mistress, friend; she was upright, merciful, charitable in a double sense, apparently devout, and certainly faithful in her religious sendees. She was held in high favour by some of the best clergymen of her day. Wherein did Bennet outwardly fail of what she should have been? She was only too agreeable, and too lovely in her wonderfully fresh delicate beauty up to middle age. The last might be a constitutional excess ; and if a woman like Ninon D'Enclos was allowed to continue fair for seventy years, might not a woman like Bennet Le Strange be permitted to retain her sweetest comeliness till her fiftieth or even her sixtieth summer ? But again, Bennet's surroundings were too much in keeping with her beauty. Bennet's house \u2014 a seasoned and picturesque cottage \u2014 had been built of wood originally, and had been largely added to. It had a genuine thatched roof, with masses of amber-flowering woodbine and purple-flowering clematis wreathed about the chimneys, and hanging down and meeting the old white jessamine and the pale passion-flower which clung to the walls, and the house leek that made a golden crown on the porch. This house of Lacey Lodge was situated in a sunny park-like paddock, sinking down at one side into a mossy dell with a brook running through it, and shaded by some of the bravest trees out of Greenwich and Charlton Parks. Bennet's garden w-as that beauty of gardens \u2014 a hanging garden, with quaint terraces, grassy and pleached alleys, flowery beds and borders, cool bowers, a fountain, and a sun-dial. Above all, it was the sweetest-smelling garden"], [332, "318 Bounty, Dignity, aud Daintiness. that ever was smelt. Then it held the finest tulip-tree which was grown at that time in England \u2014 a tree whose leaves were like huge ivy leaves, and whose exquisite cups of flowers were the wonder and pride of every florist far or near. If it is true that there are things too sweet to be whole- some, I am afraid that even the outside of Lacey Lodge might come under the category. Bennet had not made the place, she used to say almost piteously. It was part of her inheritance as a Lacey by birth, and had belonged to the Laceys, existing, in part at least, and omitting the tulip-tree and some other accessories, when the hospital was a palace, and when the Virgin Queen rode to Eltham, and on another occasion, with a corslet on her breast, to Tilbury Fort, to review her troops, and give them in charge, for their encounter with the Spaniards, to her \" well-beloved Lord of Leicester.\" But if Bennet had not made the ancient beautiful woodland lodge, it was well known that her heart clave to it ; that she exulted in every blossoming of her tulip-tree with a child's ecstacy over a perishing treasure. Even within doors, she had succeeded to more than she had \"made.\" The old cabinets, the china, the sylvan spoils of horns, antlers, and tusks, the pieces of armour, the glorious torn flags, the wild- beast skins, the ivory and sandal wood, that Laceys of past generations, who had been soldiers and sailors, fighting under Essex and Peterborough, under Drake and Blake, had gathered and garnered, were not of Bennet's accumulation \u2014 far less of her creation. But it i-as Bennet who arranged and grouped the treasures with"], [333, "Bounty, Dignity, and Daintiness. 319 corresponding genius, so that they looked as they had never looked before her day. Her daily congenial employ ment for an hour or two every morning was to fill and dispose of all the flower-jars and beau-pots, to trim and arrange the standard flowers on the stands, and to put the finishing touches to curtains, cushions, and footstools in all the pleasant rooms. In the same way, the servants were mostly old servants who had been with Bennet's father and mother. Some of them were old servants of the Le Stranges, but it was Bennet's kindness, tact, and discretion that made the Lacey Lodge servants the best for general worth and fidelity, and thorough knowledge of their business, within a circuit of many miles. The parties at Lacey Lodge were longed for beforehand, and relished w-hen they took place as no others were longed for and relished. And Bennet gave both a summer and winter series, besides exceptional impromptu parties. These two series were on a sliding scale, beginning with carriage and county neighbours, and ending with charity school children, poor widows, the halt, the maimed, and the blind. Social intercourse, scenic effect, viands, and service, were all unapproachable ; but there was no doubt that the chief charm lay in Bennet as the hostess. People would earnestly consult her on the arrangement of their rooms, the setting-out of their furniture, the ordering of their domestics, the inviting and classifying of their guests. Bennet's minage and entertainments were so notoriously perfect, and she was as willing to give advice and lend help as Christiana Apsley was, while she bad inspirations of taste to which Christiana was a stranger."], [334, "Bounty, Dignity, and Daintiness. 320 Bennet's face was a commentary on Donne's lines \" No spring nor summer beauty has such grace As I have seen in an autumnal face.\" Her beauty was a little hectic, perhaps, like that of red leaves in autumn. She was delicate \u2014 more delicaie *han most people supposed. But it was also such a balsam-like beauty that the fairest young girl was apt to look coarse by comparison. She had those \" red, red \" smiling lips and shining eyes which fade more or less and cloud with years in ordinary cases ; so that it was difficult to believe that she was beyond a woman's grand climac teric, notwithstanding that she did not seek to disguise the truth. There was the fact, too, of Nature's \"gentle powdering,\" as she was wont to argue in its defence, point ing to the silver threads already plentiful enough in her dark, silky hair, and alleging that they were just waiting to relieve the wrinkles which must soon follow. She dressed to perfection. She could not altogether avoid it, for she had a fine block on which to perform her dressing, and a fine taste with which to do it. But she certainly dressed, deliberately and with aforethought, her best. That was not extravagantly, for she was rich enough to afford ex pensive dress \u2014 and I don't know that hers was the most expensive in the end. Nor was it showily, for her delicate taste forbade such an offence. Nor was it with a restless itch for variety and change, since she was a constant woman in all her ways. Any way, Bennet Le Strange dressed to perfection. In her day the fashion of dress for women of fortune and of confessedly mature age was rich and"], [335, "Bounty, Dignity, aud Daintiness. 321 enduring. In the morning there were fine cloths, claret coloured or hunter's green, and in the evening always brocades and lutestrings, which \" stood alone \" in the thickness of their silken warp and woof. The last might be of delicate and resplendent pearl-white or pale rose dyes, or of quiet and subdued chocolate or deep violet hues, such as Bennet preferred. These somewhat stiff and heavy dresses were fashioned with a still more elaborate stiffness of fluting, plaiting, or honeycombing, or with an equally elaborate negligence were just gathered together below the bosom and above the waist, while they hung loose from the shoulders. The dress was completed with sandals for the feet, and a scarf twisted round the head by way of turban ; and its richness and sobriety were set off and lightened by clouds of lace and white muslin about the throat, at the elbows, in aprons, in light cloaks and hoods. In such a costume Bennet Le Strange was to be seen, whether in private or in company. Young and old among men gazed on and admired the whole ; young and old among women gazed on the parts, copied them, and wished to attain to something like them. But Bennet was more than a spectacle at her parties, She provided sedulously for the comfort and entertainment of her guests, and in the provision she had always one or more of the \"meats \"and drinks, whether of substantial cutlet and pastry, or of lighter syllabub and flummery, or of cool cup of home-brewed wine, which was as much hers as the Eastern princess's cream tart with pepper in it was the princess's. On account of these she was besieged for Y"], [336, "Bounty, Dignity, aud Daintiness. 322 recipes. She was also very ready and ingenious in those games of the intellect and wit, such as \" The traveller,\" or \" What is my thought like ?\" which diversified the staple of dancing, and anticipated pool and billiards. All these attractions and accomplishments vexed the soul of Miss Le Strange, who was a good woman, and fond of Bennet as she might be of one who was a sister in affection as well as a sister in law to her. But Bennet's very grace and graciousness caused Miss LeStrange to have fears \u2014not for Bennet's being giddily gay, coquetting with her numerous admirers, and contracting a second, possibly an imprudent, marriage. Miss Le Strange knew better than that ; besides, the time was past for such dangers. It was concern for Bennet's spiritual condition and lasting peace that occasioned Miss Le Strange trouble. Yet neither she nor any other body could accuse Bennet of hard worldly ambition or of idle personal vanity, farther than that she cherished the gifts which Miss Le Strange denounced as vanities. Miss Le Strange's personal experience made her to recoil with something like horror from what she called the vanities of life. For three generations before the last Le Strange had married the heiress of Lacey Lodge, dying before he had time to prove his slavery to the narrowing bent of his family or his exemption from it, the Le Stranges had been alternately spendthrift and avaricious, self-indulgent and cruel to their own flesh. Alike in scattering and in withholding, they had been signally selfish men ; and the women of the race, while they had been sufferers from the sins of the men, had"], [337, "Bounty, Dignity, and Daintiness. 323 infotuatedly copied them in corresponding foibles. Miss Le Strange's mother had been an elder sister of Lady Maria Cavendish's ; and, though Lady Matilda Le Strange had not carried matters with quite so high a hand as Lady Maria carried them, still waste and want had grown beneath Lady Matilda's feet as flowers grow beneath the feet of some other women. Lady Matilda's unmarried daughter would have been reduced to a crust had it not been for the generosity of her widowed sister-in-law. Miss Le Strange had known these evils from her youth up, and so abjured them that she could not look with tolerance on the tastes and habits which had led to one or other of the stages of selfishness run mad. When Miss Le Strange was moved to confide her doubts and distress to common friends, Bennet had equally willing and able defenders. Cassandra Fuller, who regarded with the fullest appreciation Bennet's entire success in the arts of living, dressing, and housekeeping, urged each old shrewd argument as to its being the truest benevolence and charity on Bennet's part, to live con formably to her station, and to afford honest work and wages to her servants, and to the tradesmen who supplied her wants. Christiana Apsley, to whose multifarious pensioners Bennet's purse was ever open, represented with parallel weight that she was aware Mrs. Le Strange kept within her means, for she left herself an ample allowance with which to befriend the shabby genteel, and to relieve the destitute. Miss Le Strange only shook her head despondently. \" I do not question Mrs. Le Strange's right to dispose Y 2"], [338, "Bounty, Dignity, and Daintiness. 324 of income. It would come ill off my hand to do so, nor do I doubt her worldly wisdom in disposing of it ; she is very particular and precise, and she is the soul of compassion. But, alas, if it be only natural truth and sweetness with Bennet 1 How much grace dare I attribute to a poor sinful worm who does not grudge the time and attention that my sister freely bestows on worse than trifles ?\" \" To call Mrs. Le Strange a worm !\" rebelled Cassandra Fuller ; \" though it should be an eastern form of speech.\" \" Then I wish all spiritual qualities were equal to Mrs. Le Strange's natural qualities,\" witnessed Christiana Apsley, stoutly. \" ' By their fruits ye shall know them,' \u2014 not only the men and women, but the sources of the fruits, don't you think, Miss Le Strange?\" pressed Christiana. \"And worms may be as beautiful as other creatures,\" amended Cassandra, recovering her satisfaction with the statement ; \" I know a hairy worm, striped black and yellow, who is quite a gorgeous fellow.\" Miss Le Strange was too much in earnest even to dispute this version of her similitude, or to suspect that it savoured of profanity. She still shook her head \u2014 hand some and high bred, but gaunt and without adornment in its good faith. \" None can understand and value Bennet Le Strange's merits as I understand and value them,\" she said, simply ; \" but they only serve to show how deceitful and deteriorating a love of what is beautiful and pleasant may become when it carries my sister up to"], [339, "Bounty, Dignity, and Daintiness. 325 London once a fortnight, in all weathers, merely to learn the fashions \u2014 for she mentions no other business, nor alludes to any friend or poor person whom she has visited. I think she is ashamed of the weakness, for I may say she pays this fortnightly homage to Vanity Fair by stealth, and does not care that I should speak of it to her.\" \" She may not go for the fashions ; and though she go for them, I do not see any great harm in that,\" insisted Cassandra. \" Surely a woman like Mrs. Le Strange may be trusted to go where she likes,\" Christiana improved upon the defence. As it happened, Bennet Le Strange had gone on her last mysterious mission to London. Before the next week came round she was openly and resignedly dying of a cancer (that beautiful, beloved woman !), which she could no longer conceal. She had been in the practice of going to London, that an experienced doctor might watch the progress of the disease and dress the wound. \" Forgive me, dear,\" she begged of Miss Le Strange ; \" but the knowledge would only have shocked you and the world, and your knowing it would have done me no good. Perhaps I was wrong, but I did not care to inflict upon others pain which I could keep from them. I shrank from shocking everybody ; and the doctor believed I might live for many years. The more my poor body was becoming a burden and a humiliation to me, the more I sought to cheat myself of my care, which I could thus make mine alone, by having even-thing"], [340, "Bounty, Dignity, and Daintiness. 326 about me fresh, sweet, and cheerful, and giving only pleasure\u2014 as well as what profit I could furnish to my neighbours. I could not bear to be a living sepulchre, an offence and a terror to young and happy people. Was I called upon to be only seen and heard of among them reluctantly ? Might I not innocently hide the sepulchre by decking it with flowers, and trees, and singing birds ? I do not think it was wicked. I thought it all out when I knew first what had come upon me, and set my house in order. I resolved to press my cross to my breast and cover it over, and live as I would have lived without it, having made my peace long before, and being, as I humbly hoped, on the road to my Father's house. I believed that was the bravest and best course, and it seemed the easiest to us all.\" \"Oh! Bennet, how I misjudged you!\" sobbed Miss Le Strange, interrupting the plaintive monologue. \" Hush, sister !\" objected Bennet ; \" if there was mis judging, it was my fault, but I trust the fault was not committed in pride and defiance. You know I could not be puffed up or led astray by my dress, or my table, or my garden, not even by my winsome tulip-tree, seeing the correction which I had by me day and night, waking and sleeping.

The verse which I have used as a motto reads thus : \u2014 \" She openeth her mouth with wisdom ; and in her tongue is the law of kindness.\" I believe there is a deep truth in the association. True wisdom is kindness, and true kindness is wisdom. I need not say, therefore, that the harsh, overbearing dogmatism which sometimes passes for wisdom, is not to my mind wisdom ; or that the ready complacency or weak good-nature which is frequently reckoned kindness, appears to me to be no more than a stolid indifference, which may be an unconscious cruelty, but is in fact a great cruelty. There is a wisdom which is tender in its severity, and a kindness w-hich is caustic in its truth. The heart incapable of softness cannot be humanly wise ; the heart incapable of honest indignation cannot be faith fully kind. When you think of wisdom, do not call up before your mind mere intellectual breadth and weight"], [342, "Wisdom and Courtesy. 328 (sometimes not even so much), fatally qualified by narrowness of soul, by selfishness, and by brutal morose ness. When you think of kindness, do not conjure into the front of your vision unprincipled suavity, unthinking sweetness, or that habit of caressing which is only a habit. No doubt there is wisdom of this world which is essen tially knowledge, and is purely the working of the com bined forces of imagination, aided and abetted by reason, with their trusty servant, memory. There is also wisdom, which is nearer, if it is not a very part of heavenly wisdom. Such wisdom can no more exist without the supposition of a noble, tender, human soul for its dwelling-place, than you can fancy light without also fancying a benig nant sun for its source. As I understand it, the last is the true wisdom. In addition, I think it is generally acknowledged that where large brains have existed without large hearts, the defect of the latter has marred and greatly diminished the effect of the former. With regard to women, I venture to write something stronger. No woman, however acute and sagacious, brilliant and exceptionally gifted, has ever made any influential and abiding impression on her contemporaries and on posterity, if she has not also possessed a sympathetic and loving nature. Witness, in confirmation of this, the different degrees of regard in which Lady Mary Wortley Montagu and Madame de Se'vigne' have been and are still held by men and women of letters and of the world. The highest of all wisdom cannot be had for the searching after it, though it may be had for the asking"], [343, "Wisdom aud Courtesy. 329 for it. Neither can that lower wisdom, which, although it is allied to heaven, belongs likewise to earth, be got entirely by cultivation. Like enterprise, like many other good gifts, when held in a large measure it has always been a gift originally. But let us take comfort in the fact that the germs of wisdom, like the capacity for grace, may be found in every son and daughter of Adam. These germs, too, can be sedulously guarded and nourished till they bear fruit in their degree. The quick hearty interest in what concerns our neighbours, the scru pulous heed paid to their rights, the kindly desire for their happiness, the skilful tact, the careful thoughtfulness, the delicate discretion, may not come naturally to many of us, but they belong to that goodness or godliness of heart which we are bound to promote in ourselves and others with all our soul and all our strength. What I would specially try to enforce on you girls is genuine friendly interest in what concerns your neighbours, with watchful consideration for their welfare. I have mentioned that not a few of the influences of your youth are against the development of the qualities which I am exalting. But I have not affronted you by supposing that you view any man or woman, ay, or any animal or plant in God's creation, in the light of \"common and unclean.\" You and I shall take leave to put such veritable snobbishness, such mean and vulgar illiberality of nature, at once out of the category. But you may think that youth, in its freshness and liveliness, is less fitted to sympathize with its fellows than middle age in its jaded bustle, or old age in its"], [344, "Wisdom and Courtesy. 330 languor. That thought is in itself a proof of inexperience. There are exceptions, of course ; but, as a general rule, it is youth, and not middle age, or even old age, which is most liable to show itself absent-minded, \"dreamy\" (according to the pet term of a popular writer), unobservant, im patient, or listless, \" as humour inconstantly leans,\" when one's neighbour and not one's self is in question. Once upon a time, there was a family discussion on the ex pected visits to the family of two companies of elderly and of young friends in separate detachments. The following remark was then made with quick conviction : \" I am sure our old friends will enjoy their visit, for they will see a great deal to interest and amuse them : it will not be hard to please them. But the girls \u2014 ah ! there is the rub ! because girls don't know what they would be after, and are chronically unamusable and dissatisfied.\" Is this a bad character to give of you girls ? Not so. It is but part of the inheritance of your crude, restless youth, which has grand compensations in its buoyance, exu berance, and endless promise. What I am pressing upon you is to do your best to curb and neutralise this defect, so that you may possess your youth as far as possible without a flaw. I would put the argument on lower grounds first. \" The study of mankind is man.\" All book knowledge comes, as it ought to come, far behind knowledge of man. There is no other study, unless it be meditation on the perfection of God, which can lastingly engage and satisfy men and women of every variety of mental calibre. It has been widely said and believed that the true biography of no human"], [345, "Wisdom and Courtesy. 331 being, however great or small, could be uninteresting, because w-e have so much in common, every man, woman, and child being bone of the bone and flesh of the flesh of every other. If this can be credited of a biography, which is at the best but the written reflection of a life, what is to be said of the numerous lives which are lived around us ? That they would be deeply interesting if we held the clue to them. But we do hold the clue to many of them ; only we hold it loosely, unreckingly ; we do not care to follow it, and so we miss the most absorbing and instructive phase of our present ex istence. Another of the lower grounds for urging on you to think and feel with your neighbours, to put yourselves in their places literally, and understand their situations, is that there is no recipe for winning friendliness like being friendly. You have heard the pleasant climax that \" the best way to be liked is to seem amiable, and the best way to seem amiable is to be amiable.\" No doubt there are persons in the world so mean that they may be tempted to value you by the value which you put upon yourself. You will hear them speak consistently of haughtiness as a recommendation in a man or a woman, and find them suffering without resentment the rebuffs of the arrogant and supercilious, counting themselves repaid by a little scornful notice from their small great man or woman. These false judges of human nature hold that the humble and generous man or woman, however great in other respects, has made himself or herself too cheap. They take the individual at his or her own low estimate,"], [346, "Wisdom and Courtesy. 332 and either despise, or, what is worse, trade upon and abuse the very qualities which are the test and crown of all others \u2014 qualities that would have been specially sacred to nobler natures. But these would-be knowing and crafty characters, whether they are many or few, are not the cream, but the scum of society ; and surely it is not their approval that you seek, or their awards that you set store on. I would have you \u2014 after whatever ap prenticeship to ingenuous wrath and vexation \u2014 learn to put past you with a smile or with a sigh, as being worth less and foreign to any real honour or dishonour, the verdicts of the purely self-seeking and basely worldly. Happily for us all, there remains a large class who are to be touched and penetrated by our friendliness. Of your friendliness I am speaking above all, and, believe me, though beauty and grace may prove more attractive at first sight, there is no possession which, on longer acquaintance, will so secure and retain affection, so enshrine you in loving hearts, and consecrate to you good offices and kind deeds throughout your whole life, as a friendly spirit on your part. But remember it must be a disinterested and unselfish regard for others, delighting to give regard, and not demanding \u2014 not even deliberately contemplating \u2014 return. It must not be a specious pretence at regard, with a private motive to serve and a personal end (in strict justice often baulked) to be gained. Now for the higher inducement to wisdom and courtesy. I do not know what the religion of Christ means if it is not self-surrender \u2014 after His example to give"], [347, "Wisdom and Courtesy. 333 ourselves to God and our neighbour, and by thus giving ourselves to receive ourselves back again in the best sense \u2014 new creatures, ransomed from worse than Egyptian bondage to self and sin. It is only carrying out this religion to be enlightened with respect to our neigh bours' wants and wishes \u2014 to know our neighbours as we know ourselves, and to sen-e them as we serve ourselves. It has been a fashion to describe this knowledge of mankind, this tact and skill in acting on the knowledge, as being employed for evil purposes, and by the Becky Sharps of the world. I shall not stop to ask whether such knowledge is more frequently the portion of the bad than of the good women \u2014 whether the Becky Sharps out number the Florence Nightingales. I shall content myself with saying that it is neither a necessary nor a desirable condition of Christian humanity that the undue preponderance of wisdom should be with the bad, reminding my readers of the Apostle Paul's double injunction, \" Be ye wise as serpents \u2014 and innocent as doves.\" The soft answer, the kindly reminder, the gentle warning, the honest reproach, the humorous retort \u2014 which may be next to the soft answer in turning away wrath \u2014 all imply, in order to be effectual, wisdom as well as courtesy. A large amount of sympathy with one's neighbours' interests is the nearest faculty \u2014 or con densation of faculties \u2014 to the highest order of genius. Shakespeare and Scott were wonderfully endowed with this world-wide sympathy. On its familiar expression in conversation, Sydney Smith, the best talker in England"], [348, "Wisdom and Courtesy 334 in his day, prided himself with a half boyish, innocent exultation. In truth there is no spice for conversation \u2014 not even the wicked spice of malice, or the lawful spices of mother wit and learning \u2014 equal on all emergencies to the spice of sympathetic interest in what your neighbour is saying, and consequent capability to answer him or her intelligently on subjects varying with the speakers. Let us hear no more of girls who have the mistaken notion that they are well educated and accomplished because they can play or sing with taste and execution a fragment of a great opera, draw or paint a ruin or a group of figures which might perhaps pass muster as the work of a fourth-rate artist, or converse for a few moments more or less grammatically and idiomatically in a foreign language, when it is their fortune to meet with a foreigner who cannot speak English. These attainments are all very well ; but they are trifles, after all, when the girls who have made them have no other resource for con- versation, unless what limited visiting lists supply. Such girls will take refuge in corners, in tittering knots and clusters of young people, who, if they have all other graces, want the sine qua Jion of generous appreciation ; or they will quit the drawing-room altogether, to escape the task of entertaining man or woman who has not a small conventional stamp, and whom the girls have taken it into their shallow heads to stigmatise as commonplace, dull, and tiresome. The guest whom a Shakespeare and a Scott would not have found unworthy of their respectful consideration, is turned over with characteristic shortsightedness and selfishness, as a subject just fit"], [349, "Wisdom and Courtesy. 335 for the over-strained energies of tolerant fathers and patient mothers or aunts. Yet if the girls had brains and hearts to fathom the difficulty, they would discover that it is their own brainlessness and heartlessness which prevent them from recognising in the slighted visitor a study, not merely of more value than lacet-work and croquet, but of greater moment than a copy of a Michael Angelo or a sonata by Beethoven. Let us hear no more of the senseless apathy of young girls in the circles of their elders. Let the girls modestly contribute their fresh quota to whatever discussion is going on, with credit to themselves and benefit to all concerned. And let girls themselves help to put an end to the flippancy and pert arrogance which will induce girls and women without womanly wisdom to silence the wise words of the wisest of men, in order that some foolish girl or woman may descant singly on her own petty experiences, adventures, views, and prospects, to the full stretch of her exhaustless tongue and her invulnerable self-con fidence. Any man or woman deserving the name, who has the misfortune to be among her audience, can only be by this conduct put to shame and confusion of face. TWO VISITS IN TWO LETTERS. Canterbury, July, 17 My dear Hester, I sit down to write to you to-night as I have really nothing else to do, and I am afraid I may weary and feel low. You know I have not yet got drops like those to which my aunt flies on all occasions when she is not"], [350, "Wisdom and Courtesy. 336 sufficiently amused and excited. I must make writing a letter serve instead of drops \u2014 heigho ! it will pass the time till supper, though it should do nothing else, and though it should be an equal infliction to you and to me I might read, but there are literally no books here to which one can turn for entertainment, not even the ' Ladies Magazine,' which my sister takes in for its fashions. There are only the ' Vicar of Wakefield ' and ' Gulliver's Travels ' to serve as light reading, and for heavier fare, trash of poetry and the Prebendary's sermons, written, or borrowed, when he was a curate. I think it would be some relief to me to tell you what a dreadful disappointment my visit to the Conqueror proved. I am so unlucky, I am always meeting with disappointments. Other girls seem to have good times now and then ; I don't know what I do that I have so often \u2014 invariably, I may say \u2014 bad times. If my ex pectations happen to be higher than usual \u2014 I mean about enjoying myself \u2014 I may be certain that a cor responding downfall is in store for me. Of course, I don't intend to blame you for raising my hopes with regard to visiting a commodore's family on board a ship of the line. One man's meat is another man's poison. You might have liked ways which were simply intolerable to me. I should not wonder though Susie Prior liked them. You have heard that she was to go out to the Conqueror after I left. She is an odd girl, Susie. I dare say it is because she has seen nothing, or because she has no sensibility, such as I have. Or it may be affectation \u2014her professing to like everything. No, I am wTong"], [351, "Wisdom and Courtesy. 337 there ; I have seen Susie dead set against trifies at which I should not have stuck for a moment, while she thought fit to magnify them into shocking sins. But to leave Susie \u2014 I can count on your not being so silly as to mind the plain unvarnished tale of my expedition, though the Fiveashes are your friends and connections. For that matter, I propose that my letter should divert you a little, force you to cry \" that's well hit off,\" \" that's like the poor souls,\" if not to scream with laughter; so after all you owe me gratitude instead of indignation. To cut a long story short, I reached the coast without any serious difficulty, beyond encountering the usual offences of a seaport \u2014 the coarse provision and outfit shops, and sailors' lodging-houses, the horrid smells, and the rough-looking men and women about. These offences, together with the strong sun and the glare from the sea, were so overcoming that I could see no point in people congratulating me on having had a prosperous journey so far, with fine weather to make it in. If I had arrived at a fashionable watering place, and had commanded time to dress and go out on the parade, or the pier, under proper escort, I might have enjoyed the weather \u2014 supposing it was as fine as people said \u2014 though, I must own, to me it was scorching, battering one with particles of sand and salt only next worse to rain, mud, and a howling tempest. Having to walk out in a common low place, among common low people, brought all the bad out and left all the good in the weather \u2014 I have no doubt that you understand me. The Commodore's boat came off for me. I cannot z"], [352, "338 // 'isdom and Courtesy. tell what boat it was \u2014 I have not a head for pinnaces, cutters, jolly-boats, so shall say no more about them, except that Tom Fiveash and I were out in the pinnace one day, as I have reason to recollect, and it was not that boat I went out to the Conqueror in. It did strike me on starting that some member of the family might have come to meet me. Not that I was a bit frightened, or that I am ever so weak and foolish as to get sea-sick. To be sure there was a triangular, cocked-hat of a note given me by a sailor as he pulled his forelock. The note begged me to excuse the omission because Philadelphia and Penelope had been obliged to go with their father in one of the other boats to pay a farewell visit on Philadelphia's part, whilst Mrs. Fiveash never went ashore, and Mr. Tom was already ashore absent on a visit. However, all the Fiveashes had the comfort of being aware that I was a good sailor, and the girls hoped to be back in time to meet and welcome me, almost as soon as I arrived at the ship. Tolerably cool treatment this, to begin with. I think it would only have been proper attention in some of the Fiveashes to have broken their engagements and changed their plans to look after me. But they are such a selfish family (you will excuse me for writing it), and so wedged into their strange seafaring habits, that I don't believe a wreck would upset them in any sense save one. Only fancy, the boatswain took it upon him to carry out the aunt or grandmother of a sailor who had met with an accident on board the Conqueror along with me !"], [353, "Wisdom and Courtesy. 339 The creature \u2014 she was hideously scraggy, and she wore a frightful yellow shawl \u2014 was sick, and actually I was nearly upset. I was not slow to tell the boatswain \u2014 or whoever he might be \u2014 he looked like the rest of the sailors, with his nasty, bare, wizened brown throat. and shapeless blue flannel shirt \u2014 that I should directly inform the Commodore of the liberty of which he had been guilty. But what could I expect? The brute shrugged his shoulders, and went through the farce of declaring that he had got the Commodore's orders for what he had done \u2014 a lie, I make no question, if I had chosen to expose it. I did not need to be hauled and lugged up the ship's side like the sick woman. I quite skipped up, so that one or two sailors near w-aved their absurd hats and gave me a little cheer, which put me in better humour. The decks were well enough, considering ; and there was an awning over part of the quarter-deck, which caused it to look almost like a tent at Vauxhall. The girls \u2014 not to say Tom \u2014 were not back. I need not mention that I did not care, though I missed their father. These gruff old bears of sailors are my horror. I should not care to try to wheedle and get round them ; and, without some such process, they cannot appreciate repartee or small talk. Besides, Commodore Fiveash having been stranded for three months among savages, has brought back from the contact a portion of the savage, which he has never lost. You may argue as you like against the conclusion. What do you make, in any other light, of his habitual silence, his grunts of assent or Z 2"], [354, "Wisdom and Courtesy. 340 dissent, and his ominous growls when he is opposed in any degree ? I was taken by a maid-servant, of course not half so neat or polite as a maid on shore, and wearing all man ner of eccentric manufactures of her own in the shape of cap, neckerchief and apron, to Mrs. Fiveash in the stuffy saloon ; for though it was a saloon, how could it appear otherwise than stuffy to a person accustomed to nice drawing-rooms in town and country ? I vow that in that limited space Mrs. Fiveash's face, in its turban, showed like a full moon : she had laid in stuffs for dresses to serve her whole life when she went on the first foreign station with her husband, so that the body to match the face was clad in antediluvian mode silk. She will wear black, though it is more than a year since her son, who was weak in his mind, died, and rid the family of a lasting burden, and though the girls are out of mourning. Mrs. Fiveash was happy to see me ; she could not be less when I was there on the Fiveashes' invitation, and when our families had been intimate years ago. But I wish she had not displayed her happiness by going into all the particulars of the intimacy which came to a natural end by deaths and marriages before I was born ; and by insisting that I was the very picture of my Aunt Grizel. Now I put it to you, as an impartial person, can I bear any striking resemblance to Aunt Grizel, whom I can just remember before she went out to America, with two buck teeth and red hair ? The idea is outrageous, since I have no buck teeth, and my hair is not even auburn. Mrs. Fiveash insisted that the likeness lay in the eyes"], [355, "Wisdom and Courtesy. 341 and the turn of the head, but I cannot be expected to own even so much in common with poor Aunt Grizel, the \" fright \" of my mother's family, who was just saved from dying an old maid by marrying a backwoodsman \u2014 after she was well up in years, and becoming a squatter in his company. But as you may have noticed, old women are so tenacious, that I could not, with all my efforts, put down the preposterous fancy of my having \" taken after \" Aunt Grizel in Mrs. Fiveash's doting imagination. When I had got hot and disconcerted \u2014 for a notion like that would disconcert a saint \u2014 my pre cious hostess gave me more than time to cool by launching into all the petty, monotonous details of her life \u2014 her marriage, her cruises, her children \u2014 dwelling especially on her lost Lewis, as if I had experience in imbeciles. For that matter, what was it all to me ? I was not married yet ; I was far from having made up my mind to marry a sailor. I had no children, not to particularize imbeciles. Could not the infatuated soul take such plain reasoning as that into account, as well as that I might be fidgetting to get my dress changed before the others came ? I was so sick of everything already, that it began to rankle in my mind whether it might not be the disorder in my travelling habit (which I had intended in duty to myself to be fairly becoming), with the coach drive, and the sail, which had put it into Mrs. Fiveash's stupid head to conjure up the gross impro bability that I had a look of Aunt Grizel. I contrived to change my dress \u2014 for I am clever in dressing \u2014 before the rest returned. I had a little dog-"], [356, "Wisdom and Courtesy. 342 hole of a sleeping saloon, which I was to endure the grievance of occupying along with the girls. They had certainly left it clear for me, since, peep as I liked, not a stray article of sash or hair-band or shoestring could I detect in order to form a guess of what the girls, or rather their toilets, were like ; for, you know, I had not seen them since we were all rough monkeys of children. Nothing was visible save bunkers, sea-chests, morsels of mirror fixed into the wall, or what served for a wall, cots, as if we were all children still, dressing-boxes and workboxes tidily closed \u2014 everything ship-shape, as I heard the girls call it afterwards, when they would instruct me : \" Why, Cecilia, if we kept our things lying about as you do, we should soon not be able to turn our elbows or find our goods in the great tangled heap they would make.\" I put on my cherry- coloured gauze with my ruby clasps and buckles, though it was simply a waste of good clothes. I was ready by the time the girls arrived, and at liberty to criticise them. I am surprised that you described them as fine girls. In spite of their great disadvantages, I admit that they are well-grown, round-faced, frank and good-natured looking ; but I should not have said fine-looking. I do not except Phila delphia, or Philly, as she is called here (how I should look if anybody made me Cecy !), with the interest attached to her from her being on the top of her marriage. The girls came up to me in an easy, warm sort of way, without waiting to curtsey ; but I think that, far back and"], [357, "Wisdom and Courtesy. 343 hovdenish as I found them in their dress and manners, they were a little struck with my appearance. \" It is almost a pity to wear so elegant a gown just to sit down to dinner in our family party,\" Philadelphia ventured to suggest after we had \" got on \" a little together. I was not long of discovering that the Fiveash girls, with their short curls combed out and smoothed, wore nothing better than fresh white cambric muslins. I fancy they have worn the same gowns, only getting a little bigger, with exactly the same plain bodies, and little puffed-out sleeves, and red morocco shoes, since they were babies. Yet Captain Ducat, of the Zephyr (how dead tired I grew of Captain Ducat, and the Zephyrs), who is to carry off Philadelphia in three weeks, came on board to dinner. I did not pay too much heed to Captain Ducat, since he is another woman's pro perty, and I hope that I am too well-principled to desire to poach on my neighbour's presen-es. But I cannot pretend that the property was very enviable in this case. From what I saw of Captain Ducat, I should say that he is a lean, dark, bilious-looking fellow, twenty years older than Philadelphia Fiveash if he is a day. Nobody need tell me that climate and yellow fever are in fault for his middle-aged looks \u2014 climate don't thin a man's hair and line his cheeks like that ! As to his having been fond of her since he used to visit her father's ship, and take her on his shoulder up and down the companion ladder, that nonsense is always talked when a girl marries a man old enough to be her father, and a scarecrow of a man to boot. Philadelphia"], [358, "Wisdom and Courtesy. 344 may use her freedom and chatter to him as she does for a few weeks, I am much mistaken if he has not a temper, and will keep his wife in order, and pay Phila delphia out, when the honeymoon is over. He contra dicted coolly some remark which I made, and stared more rudely than admiringly at my dress. But he is everything with the Fiveashes, and as sweet as sugar to them at present. He told his servant to cut off the braid from one of his coats and took it to Penelope, when she ran out of braid for a cap that she was making ; and he allowed her to bind his eyes with his handkerchief when she chose to play blind-man's-buff. I wonder if Commodore Fiveash acquired a fortune in prize-money, and if his daughters, living so simply as the Fiveashes do \u2014 your rich people are generally scrubs \u2014 are \" fortunes ?\" I need hardly chronicle that Mrs. Fiveash spoke of my look of Aunt Grizel before every member of the party at dinner. Happily none of them had seen Aunt Grizel ; but I felt my ears tingle with righteous indignation. What made me still more oppressively flushed was the crib of a dining-room. The odd thing was that every body seemed to expect me to marvel at its space ; and Penelope remarked to me, in the patronising accent of superior wisdom, \" I am sure you never thought that we sailors were so well off, Cecilia ?\" I could have answered her that I had thought very little about it. To complete the infliction, there was the presence of the Commodore. I have said nothing of him, and the severest observation I shall make will be"], [359, "Wisdom aud Courtesy. 345 that he ought to have remained in that desert island where he was once stranded. A more absent, surly-looking old man, to be a gentleman, I never beheld. The joke is that he was made as much of as if he was the greatest treat in the world. One girl asked me with breathless interest if I did not think her father looked well, reckon ing everything. When the Commodore gave forth a nice little growl occasionally, Philadelphia appealed in an ecstatic undertone to Captain Ducat, was it not pleasant to see her father in such spirits ? If you will believe me, the hypocrite replied in the affirmative, and added that a single monosyllable from the Commodore was so much in point that it was worth bushels of talk from other people. I heard him also hoaxing Mrs. Fiveash with the monstrous assertion that he anticipated that her husband would be quite the life of the party on a certain happy occasion. Depend upon it that the Commodore, half stark, half bristling as he is, must have had the nous to save a load of prize money. I sang during the evening \u2014 I need not record that I had no harp. The Fiveashes have no musical instrument worthy of the name; nothing but a jingling old spinnet which Mrs. Fiveash had taken on board ship when she married, and which must have had its strings thoroughly rusted with sea damp long ere this, and a squeaking violin on which the Commodore, of all men, plays an accompaniment, when he is in the humour, to his wife and daughters' jigs. I have taken such pains with my singing, and have spent so much of my little income on"], [360, "Wisdom and Courtesy. 346 lessons \u2014 indeed, people have told me that I have inherited with my Christian name a gift which I have been bound to cultivate, for \" a Cecilia must sing \" \u2014 that altogether I confess I half counted on creating a sensa tion, even in this primitive company, such as I have created in my aunt's drawing-room here, or at my sister's in London, or even in the Pump-room at Bath. My vanity had no such small triumph with my masterpieces \" La ci darem \" and \" Di tante palpiti.\" The Fiveashes and Captain Ducat listened with the greatest attention \u2014 I must confess that \u2014 but they kept their enthusiasm for \" Black-eyed Susan,\" piped by Philadelphia with about as much art as a bird pipes, and for \" Rule Britannia,\" beaten out of the old box of a spinnet, and scraped out of the coffin of a violin \u2014 fiddle the family named it. I owe the simile of a coffin to the grim solemnity with which the Commodore shouldered his instrument. I desire to be fair, so I do not say that this instance of unsophisticated musical taste proceeded purely from selfishness, though the Fiveashes are as selfish and narrow-minded a family as you may count on finding among worthy people who are strictly domesticated and keepers of home, especially if it be on board ship. The Fiveashes inquired quite eagerly if I could sing \" Cherry Ripe,\" \" Old Dog Tray,\" \" When lovely Woman stoops to Folly,\" \" On the Banks of Allan Water,\" and ballads of that stamp, and went into raptures over the per formance of a young lady who had been visiting the Conqueror, and who had given her entertainers\u2014 I should say, every street ballad from \"Barbara Allen\" to"], [361, "Wisdom and Courtesy. 347 \" Sally in our Alley.\" These were in the poor Fiveashes' style. I was glad to get to bed, though I could not sleep, and in the dead of the night a thought of ships foundering at anchor, and all souls on board perishing, which would only have made me laugh had it crossed my noddle by day, caused me to feel creepy with eerieness and misery. I got up and stumbled across our narrow quarters and woke up Penelope Fiveash, who sat up, rubbed her eyes, laughed, and protested, \" Bless the child !\" as her mother might have done. It would have been rather impertinent had she been wide awake, for she is two years younger than I by the sun, and a lifetime by knowledge of the world. Then she said more gravely, for the Fiveashes are touched with Methodism, which seems a natural result of so much domestic virtue, \"We're in good keeping, Cecilia dear; not to speak of my father's care, and that of all the dear old Jacks, who would leap overboard to keep a hair of our heads from being wet.\" Next day I was all right again \u2014 as to timidity I mean ; but I could not understand what Penelope meant when she said after breakfast, that now she was ready to show me the wonders of the Conqueror. The girl spoke with glee and pride, as if she had shops and public gardens, or a substitute for them, bucks and beaus without end to show me, whereas I had already learnt the contrary, to my discomfiture. I write it frankly \u2014 for it is a necessity with me to be entertained, and I cannot be entertained without men, well-bred men, who know a pretty, accom-"], [362, "348 Wisdom and Courtesy. plished woman when they see her, and behave ac cordingly \u2014 not grisly bears like Commodore Fiveash, or Janus-faced cynics like Captain Ducat. Alas ! I had soon found out to my mortification that the only available young man in connection with the Conqueror was Tom Fiveash, absent without leave \u2014 from me. All the other officers were either superannuated married salts \u2014 not worth their salt, or the officers had been paid off when the ship was going into dock, or they were at home with their families. As for the few lieutenants and middies on duty, they were intolerable hobbledehoys, brown powder monkeys, uncouth infants saying their drudging lessons to a disgustingly snuffy schoolmaster, and playing at furling and reefing sails, and coiling ropes, in addition to every kind of detestable mischief between their lessons. I like nice men ; I hate boys, especially such boys. I am afraid the service is deteriorating. Penelope Fiveash's wonders were the decks, with the men mopping them ; the carpenters' shops \u2014 such shops ! and the men's messes \u2014 well entitled messes, between decks; the black holeof a cock-pit, with the louts and flibbertigibbets of boys fighting over their oil lamps and spelling books ; the cook's coop of a pantry, with the man stirring a pudding fifty times more clumsily than a cook-maid would have stirred it on shore ; the yawning port-holes, the lumbering cannon, the rough masts, the creaking, tarry rigging, in which men were always sitting like birds in nests, and from which you were in constant apprehension that an ugly bird would drop and crush, not your smart cap or hat alone, but yourself into a nasty jelly. Then there was the tiresome"], [363, "Wisdom and Courtesy. 349 sea on all sides washing, splashing, surging against the barnacled sides of the ship, with the small novelty of the line of coast seen from the sea. The sole animation lent to the prospect, was by the other ships of the Commodore's division lying here and there like floating houses, with their masts representing the steeples of a town, and the boats rowing between the ships playing the part of the coaches and chairs of the same town. I was particularly called on to notice the bowsprit of the Zephyr, the rest of the ship being just round a point of land. Would you have believed that a girl of eighteen could have been so childish as Penelope Fiveash was, when she expected me to be delighted with such wonders? I imagine that if she had got any encouragement she would have gone on to get me the sight of the ship's compass and chart. She looked so blank and disappointed, though she tried to hide it, when she saw that I did not care for her wonders, that she actually put me out, and I had to dwell on having no nautical bent in order to clear my character, as if I had done something wrong. And again when I told her, with the slightest touch of satire, that Captain Ducat's ship should be called Boreas and not Zephyr, she seemed vexed, and came plump out with the question did I not like Captain Ducat ? \u2014 they were all so pleased with Philly's choice \u2014 rather with his choice of Philly. He was so sterlingly good and brotherly, and they thought his short, sharp speeches wonderfully witty\u2014 Philly had often complimented him on them, and told him that she liked a little spice better than butter in tauce\u2014 and Captain Ducat was talkative and compli-"], [364, "Wisdom aud Courtesy. 350 mentary, in his turn, compared to their father \u2014 only every word which fell from their father was worth treasuring. Did you ever hear such family bigotry and fanaticism ? Afterwards Penelope asked me doubtfully what I should like to do when I did not care to see the ship ; and I could think of nothing better than sitting under the awning and strangling sickening fits of the gapes \u2014 at least I should be sheltered there from the sun and the sea breeze, which tans the complexion so dreadfully that I wished I had not risked it for all the fun which I was likely to get on board the Conqueror. Penelope sat by me, and when Captain Ducat had gone back to his ship, and Philadelphia had played her part in the farce of watching through her father's telescope till her scarecrow was no longer visible, she joined us. I think the girls would have been well enough pleased to listen to me telling them something of life, and I should not have minded telling them when I had nothing else to do, but their heads were so full of that trumpery marriage of Philadelphia's that when I was in the very middle of great doings at Ranelagh or Kensington Gardens, I was subject to such worrying interruptions as \" Excuse me, Cecilia, but have you written to Mrs. Latham about the satin, Penny?\" or \"Oh, I beg your pardon, Cecilia, but did you have any word yesterday, Philly, whether the Moores are to be here before you go ?\" The day wore away somehow (I slipped away and had a good sleep after luncheon), and so did the evening. Next day Mr. Tom Fiveash turned up, and I thought for"], [365, "Wisdom and Courtesy. 351 f. little while that I was going to have a tolerable time of it after all. He was not at all like the rest of the family \u2014 indeed he has lived very little with them, having been educated on shore while the Commodore was on his foreign stations. Mr. Tom is the heir of his uncle, Sir Cornelius Fiveash, of Nuthurst, and was fresh from his college, though he has not much of the air of a reading man. Indeed, from what he has said to me quietly, the uncle must have kept the nephew's pockets full, and the latter must have taken many a run up to town. I cannot deny that Mr. Tom looked somewhat insignificant and commonplace, particularly after one had been regarding the battered hulk of a Commodore, or even Captain Ducat in his uniform ; but Mr. Tom Fiveash had the air of a man of fashion, and was very elegant in all his gestures. I speculated what he could think of his family ! He did confide to me that his sisters were rustic things whom my example might improve. He and I had a great deal in common, and did not need to make conver sation. I may say that I enjoyed being squired by him over the ship \u2014 we two laughing \" consumedly,\" as he said, at everything. He sat next me at dinner, and he told me a shocking scandal of our common friends the Ryles, which would have caused the ladies of the family to prick their demure ears had they heard us. Even that old donkey Mrs. Fiveash, with her muddled remi niscences of Aunt Grizel, would have jumped like a young girl and stared like a greenhorn, had she been a party to our discussion. I sang a little to him in the evening, and he begged and implored for more \u2014 I don't"], [366, "Wisdom and Courtesy. 352 think that it is outrageous vanity in me to state here my honest impression, which is that my singing put the finishing touch to the favourable effect that my looks had produced on Mr. Tom Fiveash, for he is a great admirer of beauty \u2014 particularly of cream-tinted skins and dark eyes. More days passed away, really quickly. I could not have credited the difference\u2014 until I could comprehend, without being guilty of anything so low as eaves dropping, just by catching up and putting together muttered words and sentences which I could not help overhearing, that the family did me the honour of being jealous and disapproving of the constancy of my associa tion with Tom Fiveash. She did not like her elder son to go so far with any girl unless he meant something, the old lady puffed and panted (a gross pretence !). \" Won't do at any price \u2014 finishing of Tom,\" growled that horrid Commodore. Mixture ofprettiness, ignorance, affectation, and arrogance, he, for one, should not envy Tom, sneered Captain Ducat \u2014 I daresay not, Captain Ducat, and you would not get the chance of envying Tom Fiveash. If Tom had fallen in love, nothing more was to be said, sighed the girls ; otherwise they feared that we should not all be comfortable \u2014 as if I should trouble myself with their fears, or mind whether anybody was comfortable save myself \u2014 my business was to please myself. But a greater misfortune than the Fiveashes' displeasure, supposing I had agreed to marry Tom Fiveash, was hang ing over me \u2014 I always am so unfortunate. My tolerable times never last many days ; it is as if detection and"], [367, "Wisdom and Courtesy. 353 demolition dogged my heels. Mr. Tom had often asked me to take a pleasure sail with him in one of the small boats. Of course it was not convenient for the other girls, good-natured as they give themselves out to be, to accompany us. Captain Ducat wanted Philly, or her mother wanted Penny, or the dressmaker had come on board to try on dresses, or visits were due from some of the ladies in the neighbourhood, and so there was always an end to our proposed excursion. We, that is, the leaders in it, Tom Fiveash and I, were not to be baulked, but determined to take the sail by ourselves ; however, as there was sure to be a fuss made about this arrangement, if it were known, we agreed to steal a march upon the rest, take French leave, and have our row before they were aware of what we were about. The secrecy, the stratagem, the tete-il-teteishness of the affair added immensely to its zest \u2014 though I had a suspicion that we should get into grief, and made up my mind to be found fault with and lectured, as much as any one dared, afterwards. I did not belong to the Commodore, and, at the worst, I was a lady and he was a gentleman, in spite of his savageness. We managed to get away unobserved in the course of the morning, at some \" bells \" or other, just as one \" watch \" had gone down and before another had come up. The boat struck me immediately as terribly small, and the weather was not propitious. It was dull and grey, with a mist coming on, which I felt would soon take the starch out of my lace and muslin, and the curl out of my hair, render me draggled and miserable, and chill the marrow in my bones. I had no sooner entered on 2 A"], [368, "Wisdom aud Courtesy. 354 our adventure, than with my quickness I detected that it would prove a failure ; but though I am apt to give way to my feelings, because I am so sensitive, I did not like to be beaten. I made a great effort, tried to be as com fortable as circumstances would permit, leant back in the stern of the boat, paddled with my ungloved hand in the water, and chatted easily with Mr. Tom. I counted on being repaid by his admiration, which he had been already showing me pretty plainly. But it would not do, he was occupied with the care of the boat, and could only lend me divided attention. There was a ground swell, and, horror of horrors, I became sick ! Judge of what my feelings were, sensible that a fine gentleman and an admirer of beauty like Mr. Tom Fiveash would hate to be put about, and would be affronted at being compelled to contemplate beauty in its worst dishabille. It was a small compensation that I nearly forgot all about him, I was so occupied with groaning over my own sufferings. I suffer so keenly when I do suffer, that I cannot bear to think of it ; but he showed some pity, men generally do in these cases, and sought to pacify me ; for so far as I could speak, I was naturally demanding to be taken back to the ship ; besides, I was cross with the sickness, and with Tom Fiveash for bringing me into such a plight. I found that it was a good deal easier to leave a ship and row half-a-mile with the wind and tide, than to row back against them, and procure all the relief within my power of being once more on something like solid ground and under shelter. We, or rather Tom, had contrived to row so far,"], [369, "Wisdom and Courtesy. 355 keeping clear of the ships belonging to the fleet ; but now the mist descended like a thick dripping sheet, we \u2014 that is, he \u2014 did not know where we were, while the swell rose into big waves, and it became more and more difficult for him to prevent the water from breaking into the boat and to pull her along. He had not much experience in boating, or, as I understand, he would never have taken me out on such a day. He ought to have known better, and if I had been drowned, my drowning would have lain at his door, and my ghost would have haunted his ghost, which I fancy would have been easier than for a ghost to haunt a living man. The more disagreeable and dangerous our position grew, the more I insisted on being taken back at once to the Conqueror, and after he had explained that he was doing his best to take me back, and argued with me till he was tired, he held his tongue and sulked, whatever I chose to say, which w-as certainly behaving very unlike a gentleman. At last the water began to spout in little jets into the boat. I screamed and flung myself to the other side. He swore that if I did not sit still I should upset the boat and drown us in two seconds, and that if I did not liy to bail out the water, using his cocked-hat for a pail, he could not help it gathering until it swamped us. I never, never thought that I should bless the nut cracker, parchment-covered face of Captain Ducat, but I was nearer blessing it than I ever was blessing face before or since, when, at the height of our predicament, after faintly distinguishing (and not daring to trust our 2 A"], [370, "356 Wisdom aud Courtesy. ears that we distinguished it) the sound of shouts and of the beat of oars advancing through the mist, a long boat full of strong, skilful sailors, with Philadelphia Fiveash's intended husband steering, broke upon our sight, swept up to us, threw out a rope and dragged us to the long boat, and took us from our nutshell and our danger into its comparative space and safety. We had been absent from the Conqueror above two hours. The family had missed us, had taken alarm from the state of the weather, and boats had been sent out in all directions, this one with Captain Ducat in charge among others. I am told there would have been no great danger had it not been for Mr. Tom Fiveash's landsman's incapacity for boating on anything save a river, and his being hampered with me, who could not have been expected to act otherwise than I acted. Altogether I am not astonished that when I got up late next day I discovered that Mr. Tom had resolved not to show face, but had taken his departure before I could come on deck, and was gone ashore again on a short visit to his uncle, of which there had been no word the previous day. If that was not small and childish behaviour in a grown man \u2014 not even waiting to hear whether he could obtain my forgiveness \u2014 I do not know what is. But I saw that it would be better that I should go too and look up my aunt, the Canon's widow at Canterbury, before the autumn gaieties with the last new curates and the hand somest of the bachelor canons, were over. These would be infinitely more amusing, not to say profitable, than"], [371, "Wisdom and Courtesy. 357 more days on board ship, where all the good I had accomplished was to waste several dresses and injure my complexion. I am nothing short of blowsy with that last day's work at Mr. Tom's instigation (does he not owe me reparation if ever he cross my path again ?), and I have caught a cold. Besides, if the Fiveashes do not keep my counsel for their son and brother's sake, I may have spoilt my character for dignity and discretion among prudish, spiteful matrons and spinsters. The Fiveashes did not press me to prolong my visit, which was stingy enough, although, of course, I would not have stayed, not for ten thousand worlds. But it was as little as the Fiveashes could have done to put staying in my power, seeing how little satisfac tion I had derived from accepting their invitation, the slender entertainment which they had provided for me, and the positive disastrousness of my poor attempt at procuring entertainment for myself. I hope that I shall bear them no grudge, but upon my honour they deserve that I shall. For my own credit I parted with the Fiveashes in peace and charity, and here I am about to be launched on the round of dinners and suppers of the dozy, drowsy cathedral city. What do you not ow-e me for passing an idle evening in writing down my unfortu nate adventures with all these particulars of your friends? At the same time, if I cannot hunt up a frank the budget may never reach you.

It seems that the frank had not been secured, and the writer had not spent postage money on despatch ing to the person to whom it was addressed an epistle which had served its purpose when it had helped her to get rid of a heavy hour, and served her as a vehicle to carry away what she called her sensibilities. His Majesty's Ship The Conqueror. Off \u25a0 , 1 6th July, 17\u2014. My dear kind Friend, Since it was your goodness which procured me all this week's pleasure, I have had a letter ready written for you, with all the particulars of my delightful visit here noted down at intervals, up to the last day, when I was to go ashore, and post it right off before I started in the coach, that you might have one of the first accounts of my week's life on board ship. Even with my best telling you can hardly understand how bright a week it has been, and how I shall not only quote from its experience, but keep it as a white spot throughout the rest of my life. The journey to the great seaport was perfect in its way ; and it was so nice to put my head out of the coach window, and feel the crisp salt-flavoured wind, and know I should have it blowing all around me, with"], [373, "Wisdom and Courtesy. 359 nothing but water between me and France and Germany, for days and nights. The town was very busy, and was unlike our landward towns, with a rollicking Jack-tar air as if to qualify the terrible earnestness of its anxiety when ships are long past due, and boats are a-missing. I would fain have stayed a while to grow familiar with the bleached brick and seasoned wooden houses ; the projecting shop-windows, sometimes with the trunk of a living and green tree, used as a support for an upper Story ; the wharves and building yards ; the forest of shipping ; the men with blue shirts for white smocks, and the women\u2014 every one with gold ear-rings. But some thing still better was awaiting me. The Fiveashes had considerately placed one of the Conqueror' s boats at my disposal, and there it was, lying at the pier, in order to take me and Mr. Tom Fiveash, who was returning from a visit to his uncle, out to the ship. Mr. Tom and I had not been introduced ; but, of course, we guessed each other's identity, and bowed and curtseyed, and he bade me welcome quite civilly. I say quite, for I must acknowledge I had entertained a considerable dread of Mr. Tom Fiveash. Cecilia Maynard had told me, when I met her the night I stayed with the Lovels near Canter bury, that Mr. Tom Fiveash was a very fine gentleman indeed, and a great admirer of beauty. She hinted that they two had been good friends, which might well be, since Cecilia is a fine lady, a belle and a toast ; but I am nothing of the kind. On this special occasion, to increase my panic, I remembered too well, that, on the only time I had ever been in a small boat before, the motion had"], [374, "Wisdom and Courtesy. 360 not agreed with me, and I had no confidence that I should not repeat the misdemeanour. I could only resolve on giving as little trouble as possible ; and upon my word, when the giddiness and nausea went off, I think the contrast enhanced my satisfaction. As for Mr. Tom, I am pleased to bear witness that he behaved with forbearance and indulgence. He told me that I was not to say again I was a bad sailor ; he had a bad sailor in his eye when he spoke, he added. The idea of going up the perpendicular side of all these decks made the giddiness return ; for I am sorry to have to confess that I have a weak head. But there were so many strong friendly arms stretched out to gird me round, and pull me up, that I shut my eyes and submitted myself to them, finding that the anticipation was a great deal worse than the reality, as I have lived long enough to discover is true in many trials. One felt as in a castle when one stood on the firm deck, with all the pillars of masts and chain-work of cordage. There are bulwarks in ships as in castles, and port-holes and drawbridges. Captain Ducat told me that the first notion of a man-o'-war was as nearly as possible a floating castle, and that the early ships were even more like castles than ships are now. Another fancy of mine is that a great ship is like a church, with the cross beams between decks instead of a roof, the ribbed sides for walls, and the masts foi a whole cluster of steeples. But I'll not tease you any longer with my fancies. The young ladies your friends answered closely to your description, and received me \u2014 for your sake it must"], [375, "Wisdom and Courtesy. 361 have been, to begin with \u2014 as if they had known me all our lives. They loaded me with kindness. They are nice unspoilt girls, and very like ladies in their simple freedom from self-conscious airs and graces. Being far from a beauty myself, I only venture to give my opinion on the Misses Fiveashes' beauty deprecatingly. To my mind they are both of them very pretty girls \u2014 there is such a sparkle and freshness about them, qualities which belong to their sea. I call it theirs, because they amaze me by the information that, as the Commodore has been allowed to retain his wife and family with him, they have passed the most of their lives on foreign stations and at sea. However, they have never been in a battle, when they say petticoats are least wanted on board, and only once in a chase. Still, is it not a convincing proof, my dear madam, that girls may grow up well-mannered anywhere, to see your god-daughter and her sister what they are, when they have only been taught, like their brothers, by a chaplain, had lessons on the spinnet from their mother, and got an odd lesson or two in dancing from some dancing master at a convenient station ? I assure you they are as prettily behaved as you could wish them to be. I am only a country girl myself, and am no great judge, but I am sure judges would agree with me. As a proof of it, a good and clever man and tried officer, Captain Ducat, has made choice of Philly before all other women far more finished and trained, for his companion and partner, and that after knowing her all her life. If the girls were kind as girls could be, Mrs. Fiveash was even kinder, with the motherliness which belongs to"], [376, "Wisdom and Courtesy. 362 warm-hearted women of her age. To own the truth, 1 had felt just a little lonesome since I left my own mother, and went, even for no more than a week among strangers, to seek my fortune, as you and the dear Squire would say to plague me. But I should have been mortally ashamed to mention my silliness, after all the regard for me which made you get me the treat of a week on board ship in your place. Because the Fiveashes wrote, and begged for your company, and you replied that you were too old a woman, (which you are not,) to go so far from home, but you had a young friend who would relish such a novelty. Further, you persuaded my father and mother that it was not good for girls, even eldest daughters, to remain always at home, and that when a fitting oppor- tunity offered they should see a little of the world, so long as they were young, strong, and free. Lastly, you rode into Aldersleigh, and bought the prettiest gown I ever had, in order to make me presentable ; and when I tried it on and showed the Squire how sine I was, he turned me round and round, then kissed me, and clasped the loveliest gold necklace round my throat, and said that was for coming to tell him the news, and to read the prints to him when he was laid up with the gout. As if I needed reward for what had been real enjoyment to me ? I like to sum up your and the Squire's bounties, and think what I owe you, since it is to you that I owe it. I hope I shall never be ungrateful for all the benevolent interest which you have taken in me and my people, and that I shall always strive to do it credit. I merely tell you of the little home-sick-"], [377, "Wisdom and Courtesy. 363 ness which has worn away long ago, to bring out in bolder relief the goodness of Mrs. Fiveash, and its effect \u25a0, for I was no sooner with her, sitting on the sofa beside her, holding her skeins of wool (she is working footstools for Philly's drawing-room on shore) and talking of you, than I felt as if I were all right and at home again with you and mother. But how delightfully people do contrive to live on board ship ! I always knew that forks and knives and spoons w-ere to be had, with meat to employ them on (so the Squire is not to laugh at me, and pretend that I did not know so much), but Mrs. Fiveash's saloon is like any lady's drawing-room which is not very large \u2014 only fresher, and with a view of the waves and other ships, where your drawing-room looks into your flower-garden, and ours into Blackberry Lane behind the vicarage. There was nothing different in the bed-rooms, or rather sleeping-berths, from other small unpretending family bed rooms, any more than the saloon was different from other drawing-rooms, except that furniture, basins, and mirror, as well as the very drawing-room ornaments, were all fixed in their places, not merely to make more room where space is the first consideration, but as a necessity in stormy weather. Penny Fiveash declares that it is very funny to brush your hair when, if you drop the brush, it keeps rolling away from one side of the room to the other as the vessel lurches ; and that she and Philly have often had to catch each other round the waist \u2014 Penny to keep Philly, and Philly to keep Penny \u2014 from rolling away too, in the midst of their laughter."], [378, "364 Wisdom ami Courtesy. That is a kind of fun which I should rather hear of than see, though I dare say, as the girls assure me, I might appreciate seeing it in time. At present it is the finest weather, so that I do not apprehend having practice in storms. It seems so friendly in the girls to let me share their cabin just now, when they have so much to say to each other \u2014 sisters who have been together all their lives and are just about to part. I could hear the sound of their whispering for an hour after I was in my bed or cot. They spoke low in fear of disturbing me, and I made as much haste in falling asleep as I could manage. I was glad to find that Philly and Penny dressed usually as inexpensively as myself \u2014 my father could not provide me with constant holiday suits, and I should not have liked to take them if he had thought of such a thing, because there are so many young ones at home. As for my dainty crape, I keep it for great occasions, but I wear the Squire's gold necklace every night just now, and it is more than enough to set off my clear muslins. After all, I think our clear muslins \u2014 -I say our, for Philly and Penny both wear just such muslins as mine \u2014 serve their every-day purpose very well ; and I know I like mine all the better that I worked the flounces and epaulettes myself. I can sit and look at the pattern any time and recall pleasantly that \" the Franklins were with us when I sewed that ;\" \" I finished this when I was sitting by father after he had been thrown from his horse, and we were so thankful that the worst of his accident was a broken arm.\" Philly and Penny have not worked their gowns because they were ill off for patterns, but now"], [379, "Wisdom and Courtesy. 365 they are delighted to borrow- mine. They call my gown my \" log \" when I recount the passages of my life \u2014 the haymaking or nutting parties, the fright which we had with supposed highwaymen \u2014 that are embroidered along with the cotton in the different scallops. The girls are wild to begin their gowns, and say, were these already done, the scallops would be \" the day we sighted his French Majesty's ship the Vengeance;\" \"the evening after the squall, when the men were splicing the broken yards, and Mr. Yeames the surgeon had good hopes that Ben Oakley would recover from the effects of his fall ;\" \" the little dance on the quarter-deck for the visitors from Cape Town.\" Before dinner I was presented to Captain Ducat, and I think, my dear friend, you may rest secure as to his being worthy of Philly, and as to Philly's happiness, so far as it is in her husband's keeping. Captain Ducat is a fine dignified man, though he is thin and delicate looking through his bronze, but that only renders him more interesting, and I believe the delicacy is more in look than in constitution. He is a scholarly man, as Blake was, and has gathered a choice little library on board the Zephyr. They tell me, and I can believe it, that he fights like a lion, and at the same time he has far greater power over the seamen than the officers, how ever gallant, of the old school, who, in general ignorance and coarseness, were little above the standard of the men. Captain Ducat seems quiet and reserved in com pany, as I have observed scholars are apt to be ; but he also makes quick ironical speeches, which would be"], [380, "Wisdom and Courtesy. 366 only too cutting if he were not thoroughly good. One soon learns how he fires up at a tale of wrong and injustice, and how he is touched by a tale of patient suffering. But the girls admit that Captain Ducat, much as they love him in their several ways, is not, any more than the Commodore (as if the Commodore could be spoken of in a breath with any other man !), a fitting representative of a sailor. To see a true joyous sailor, I should see their second brother Billy, who is a lieutenant on board the Cracken. With regard to him they have a faint hope, as the Cracken is ordered home with troops, that he may arrive in time for his favourite Philly's marriage. Philly is not shy or coy with Captain Ducat, as probably she might have been with any other dis tinguished man fifteen years her senior, because he has been so much on the same stations and is such an old friend of the Commodore's that she remembers him coming about the house \u2014 the ship, I mean \u2014 all her life. She is as playful as a kitten with her lover, and he brightens so and is so terribly witty, but with a kind of harmless sheet-lightning brightness, in response to her skittishness, that you cannot imagine anything sprightlier or more amusing than their wooing at this advanced stage. Philly reminds me of Lady L. in \" Sir Charles,\" without Lady L.'s self-conceit and pertness ; but Captain Ducat is not at all like poor cowed, confounded Lord L. Captain Ducat terms Philly \" chatterbox \" and \" sauce box,\" and threatens to tame her as Petruchio tamed Katherine, by educating her afresh from the foundation, with the first rule to leam to hold her tongue and to"], [381, "Wisdom and Courtesy. 367 pay him prompt, implicit obedience, and Philly counter threatens that she will lead him such a life ! and compel nim to burn his books. I write this for your and the Squire's benefit. Think, if you can, what my feelings were when I was presented to the Commodore ; I had so often wished to see him after what you had told me of his story. He escaped from the wreck of his gunboat, and was cast ashore with three sailors, and the small stock of pro visions which they had been able to save, on the dreadful reef with the single palm-tree and the spring of water. The Commodore, Captain Fiveash then, remained there with his men for a month while the provisions lasted. They had succeeded in kindling a flame by rubbing two pieces of wood together, and afterwards they kept up the sire which they had made, by watching it day and night, as the flame from heaven was kept up on the altar of the temple at Jerusalem, only watcher after watcher dropped off with the weeks. One seaman, turbulent and mutinous, put off without leave on a raft, and perished before his companions' eyes ; another, in seeking wild fowls' eggs, missed his footing on the rocks, fell, and was dashed in pieces; while the third pired, grew melancholy mad, and died on the rude bed which the shipwrecked men had contrived for themselves. Captain Fiveash saw them all die, buried the two last as decently as he could, struggled to keep up his fire, sleeping only by snatches, and was found at last by the boat's crew which put ashore on the reef from the merchantman whose \" look-out \" first descried Cap tain Fiveash's signal that had been flying for weeks. His"], [382, "368 Wisdom and Courtesy. deliverers found their solitary man sitting with his head in his hand by the dying-out fire, the last eggs which he had been strong enough to gather, placed in the sand near him, and the last shell which he had been able to fill with water, at his side. I repeat all this to bring before your mind with what breathless expectation I had looked forward to seeing this hero. He was like a grand rugged rock himself \u2014 more like that than a wreck, though he has never entirely shaken off the effects of the awful loneliness which he endured and survived. John the Baptist could not come out of the desert and comport himself like other men. But there is nothing unpractical or morose in Commodore Fiveash's habits of silence and brooding reflection. He is perfectly alive to everything which concerns the honour and welfare of every ship in his fleet and every sailor in his own ship. He is an active as well as an experienced sailor when active service is in question. There is something beautiful in the tenderness with which his habits are regarded and respected, not merely by his family and friends, but by his sailors. I have noticed the roughest man-before-the mast stop his yarn or step stealthily in order to preserve the stillness of the Commodore's walk on the quarter deck, or of his seat in his cabin. Of course the Com modore did not take much notice of me beyond a nod and a \" glad to see you, young lady \" (wasn't that honour enough ?), on my being named to him. I should have been abashed if he had said anything more at that time. But he did speak to me aftenvards \u2014 he actually spoke to me, and in reference to his strange life on the desert"], [383, "Wisdom and Courtesy. 369 island. This was how it came about. Captain Ducat had spoken at the tea-table of his disappointment in not being able to get a Delphine classic on which he had set his heart. He was speaking to Mr. Tom Fiveash, who seemed only half attending, not to me. But I remem bered that my father had procured such another classic siom one Lisle in Gray's-Inn Lane, London, and I thought I might mention the circumstance. Captain Ducat listened with attention, announced that he would have recourse to Lisle, and declared that he was greatly obliged to me for the information, asking, between jest and earnest, what he could do for me in return. \" Nothing,\" I answered, \" unless,\" and I said this after a little struggle with false shame, \" to allow a girl like me to think that through my father, who is nearer Captain Ducat's level, I have been of a little service to him.\" He laughed at this, and said that he had always imagined it was ladies who stooped, and as they could not help the process, he wondered why young ladies should be tortured by the application of back-boards \u2014 not that Miss Philly Fiveash (who was within hearing) would not have been much the better for a back-board and a starched ruff, supposing ruffs had not gone out of fashion before hoops. Afterwards, he was very pleasant with me, so that I tvas bold enough to say that I was surprised a naval officer could have found opportunity to be a scholar. To Ivhich he replied, that where there was a will there was a way, particularly w-here there was no lack of time. 2 B"], [384, "Wisdom and Courtesy. \u25a017\u00b0 Blake, so far back as his day, had not only been an incomparably greater officer, but also a far finer scholar than such poor pretenders to scholarship as he, Captain Ducat. Blake had not only emerged from the tro 'des of the civil wars, but had been first a country gentleman, and then had risen to the rank of a general on shore, before he went to sea at all. At the same time, Captain Ducat remarked that he would not give an original observation for all the mere book learning in the world. I supposed that he alluded to the Commodore, who is not bookish ; but I also thought of my father's friend, Mr. Curror. After retiring from business in London to the Cherry Gardens farmhouse many years ago, Mr. Curror has lived to attain a marvellous knowledge of animals, plants, and the weather, so that he is consulted by farmers on their stock, and on grubs and insects ; by herb doctors, for miles and miles round, on herbs ; while no old wife in whatever rank, far or near, would think of undertaking a longer journey than usual without first sounding Mr. Curror on the signs of the sky and the earth, whether it is to be rain or fair, cold or heat. Mr. Curror would have been burnt for a wizard had he lived a hundred years earlier. I ventured to quote some of his singularly accurate prog nostications of blights in crops and of storms, seeing that Captain Ducat cared to hear them, when, to my con fusion at the time, though it is to my pride when I think of it now, I became aware that the Commodore had come up behind us, was listening to our conversation, and at last joined in it, for a moment addressing me particularly : \" I learnt to foresee a gale from the south-east, which"], [385, "Wisdom and Courtesy. 371 always damaged the hut, by an exceptional commotion among the petrels, and by distinct tints in the colour of the water where it poured over the shelving rocks, when I was on the island.\" I had just presence of mind to reply, \" I shall store up that fact for Mr. Curror, sir,\" and the Commodore nodded and turned on his heel. I fancy he has taken notice of me more and more kindly ever since, especially when he has caught me watching the descendants of the grey rabbits which he brought back with him from the island, and which he always feeds with his own hands. Penny tells me that her father says the rabbits were among the best friends that Providence ever gave him. If he had not made friends with the rabbits and the birds, so that they quickly made friends with him again, and would come leaping and flying to his knee and shoulder, he would have gone melancholy mad, like poor Baker who pined and died, and never returned to his fellow men, his country and his home. You will see that I was right when I stated that the Commodore was not morose. In additional proof of my statement, he is fond of music, and plays almost every night in a family concert with his girls \u2014 I never felt what a loss it might be not to have a musical ear till I saw and heard the father and daughters. And Mrs. Fiveash told me with beaming eyes, that though she leaves playing mostly to the girls now, it was her music which won the Commodore, and there are some tunes which he is never satisfied with, unless they are given by the fingers of his old wife. She met him first, soon after he came home like a man from the grave, 2 V. 2"], [386, "Wisdom and Courtesy. 372 when he was staying with his brother, Sir Cornelius, to recruit, and everybody was making much of him, as he deserved, but he shrank from everybody. Only she was his sister-in-law's cousin, and she was living in the house with him like one of the family. She knew and was care ful of his feelings, and at last he would come into the drawing-room and sit silent in a dark corner, listening to her when she played on the spinnet and sang her ballads of an evening. From listening he got to talking and walking with her \u2014 not that there had been much talking and walking needed, for the wedding was brought about at Sir Cornelius's place within three weeks of their having made each other's acquaintance. She went with him when he was posted to a new ship, to comfort and cheer him as Rebecca went to comfort and cheer Isaac. She was only to go for the first cruise, and until they reached a station ; but she was permitted, by savour, to remain. And so the sea has been her home \u2014 and yet to think that Mrs. Fiveash, when she set sail with her sailor, had not seen the sea any oftener than I had, when I came on board the Conqueror! She allows that she felt the life strange and lonesome at first, with so very quiet a man as the Commodore ; but if he was quiet he was true and tender of her to the heart's core, and he was never violent as many sailors are. He had left all fumes and frenzies on the desert island. He did not need to rage and storm ; a word from him, with or without his speaking-trumpet, has always been enough to the Vice-commodore and to the smallest powder monkey. Then she had her duties to do, and her children were born to her. I do not"], [387, "Wisdom aud Courtesy. 373 know., though, that before going to sea at all, she would shiver and feel that \" the waters were going over her heart,\" as I did when I thought beforehand of my first night at sea, with but a few planks between me and the treacherous waves ; yet when the time came I had only a soft awe and a quiet confidence, realising that He \" holdeth the waters in the hollow of his hand.\" The pen cannot record the world of nautical and marine wonders to which I awoke next morning. Penny was so good as to leave all the marriage preparations to take me over the ship. What busy life there is in these streets between decks ; each street is, as it were, a hive of bees \u2014 male bees, for the Fiveashes' women-servants don't come here, unless on sight-seeing, as Penny and I were doing. Yet these clusters of blue-shirted, brown-tanned, hearty men are not, one is thankful, really cut off from family ties, like monks in cells. I could not help thinking how many women's hearts were beating for them in tidy little rooms in seaport alleys, or in cottages on the shingle in fishing villages. And do you know Penny minded, and I am so glad that it occurred to her, that she had heard one of the men \u2014 one Nat Pound \u2014 was from our parish in Kent ? She had him called, and he proved to be a brother of Farmer Pound's of Deepdene. He had been long away, and had not heard of his friends for years ; I suspect he had run to sea in his youth, and so had quarrelled with his family. But he looked touched and proud to learn his brother's prosperity, and asked me bluntly, when we had done speaking, if I would take charge of a few things which he"], [388, "Wisdom and Courtesy. 374 had picked up in his voyages, and which his brother's family might have as a remembrance of him, that is, if so be they liked to take and keep 'em. I answered, \" With all the pleasure in the world,\" and who knows but these tokens may be the olive branch between severed kin ? Penny went about in these long, dim workshops recognising old and young, intelligently and pleasantly, inquiring for this old man's rheumatism, and pro mising to that young man to write for him to his wife, just as I should do in the village at home. I have often heard of the good hearts and the gallantry of sailors, and now I have had experience of these desirable qualities. The different groups of officers and men made way for us willingly ; they took pains to show me what they were doing, and they looked positively gratified by the interest and admiration of a plain country girl like me. They would have me taste their biscuits and grog while they drank my health along with Penny's, so that you must tell the Squire I, too, have been a toast for once in my life. How enchanted the boys at home would have been with the furling of the sails and the coiling of the ropes. Some of it was done by boys no bigger than themselves \u2014 the brave little middies \u2014 who are just like other boys, dogged and merry by turns over their lessons, but who when they are in full dress going on shore, never fail to remind me of princes in fairy tales and \" bonnie boys \" in ballads. One of the middies had a dear curly head like that of my dead brother Charley, and he climbed up the rigging just as Charley used to climb the"], [389, "Wisdom and Courtesy. 375 apple trees in our orchard. What would you and mother say to the tailoring, the shoe-making \u2014 that is nothing \u2014 the baking, the boiling, the roasting, the washing, the scouring, all done, and done to perfection, by men ! Would not you two hold up your hands as you passed through these departments ! But you two would believe your eyes, not so our Peggy and your Ann. I shall not dare to open my mouth before them on these matters when I go home. What I liked still better, and what would have amused the Squire, was to go round the hatches where were the Commodore's cherished rabbits, and coops of common poultry \u2014 the cocks crowing and the hens laying as much at ease as in barn-yards on shore. Then there were the pens and stalls where sheep, oxen, and horses are quartered, though they are empty at present except for two sedate, sea-seasoned milk cows ; and a silver-bearded goat, \" Queen Dido,\" Penny called her, which has sailed for the last five years in the Conqueror, knows and will follow all the Fiveash family like a dog or a pet lamb, and is Penny's special possession and favourite. The Fiveashes have been most kind in not making a stranger of me \u2014 beyond showing me the marvels of life on board ship, and in letting me work with the rest in the merry wedding doings \u2014 indeed we girls have been merry. But I cannot think that I have been of much use, although I could tell what I had seen at my cousins' weddings, and it is in the Fiveashes' generous hospitality that they have insisted on my prolonging my visit and staying over the wedding, as if I belonged to the family. No doubt I shall enjoy it immensely. I shall surely have some"], [390, "Wisdom aud Courtesy. 376 partners at the ball in the evening, when the Commodore is to entertain the families on shore in the neighbour hood with whom he is acquainted, and who have been attentive to the officers of the fleet. They will be strangers to me ; and Mr. Tom Fiveash, who has always behaved like a courteous gentlemen to me, may give me a turn, though he will have a great deal of dancing on his hands, besides his individual call to look out for beauties. I heard him asking Philly to tell him the girls who were not to be frights at her marriage ball ; of course, he said, he excepted the company present. The Squire may chuckle as he pleases, but it is a serious question this of partners or no partners to a girl on her first great ball, and it is not as if I were at home where all our neigh bours are indulgent and would befriend me for my father and mother's sake, and yours, and the Squire's. If I do get my share of dancing here, I shall owe it to the mind fulness of the Fiveashes, or to your crape and the Squire's necklace. Any way I shall have enough of entertainment watching the other dancers, and I must take a deal of notice and pick up all the new fashions in turbans and scarfs for you and mother, and in figures of dances for little Rosy and Dolly. I am provided with a partner \u2014 at least I have got an interest in one with all the other sitting girls on the quarter-deck, where the ball is to be held, while the rigging is to be hung with coloured lamps, so that, with the reflection in the water, it is expected that Vauxhall or Ranelagh will be nothing to the scene. Mr. Billy Fiveash has arrived. He posted from Portsmouth, seized a"], [391, "Wisdom and Courtesy. 377 waterman's barge, boarded the Conqueror in spite of the watch, and knocked us all up at five o'clock in the morning. He does look as if he would dance right on through the ranks of the company \u2014 nay, as if in his good humour he would prefer a dowdy of an ordinary girl at a time, even though she did not wear white crape and a gold necklace. He is the life of the family, of the great ship itself, now that he is come. He is a good fellow to everybody, from cracking jokes with the old sailors, who adore him, to holding his mother's worsted. He brought Philly a crimson and gold China brocade gown-piece that no woman who was not the Queen of Sheba, and had not made up her mind to be pointed at as one of the wonders of the world, could wear for a gown. But Philly says, \" I shall manage to get good use of it in scarfs, aprons, and turbans, somehow, for the love of Billy.\" He brought the girls, also, charming carved combs ; ivory boxes for his mother ; a Chinese manuscript for Captain Ducat ; Chinese vest stuffs for Mr. Tom ; neckerchiefs and tobacco to old friends among the women-servants and sailors ; and to his father a tiny growing plant which had evidently cost the bearer the greatest trouble of all. He believed it to be a specimen of a rare plant which the Commodore had met with on his island. How eagerly the Commodore examined the seedling, rewarding the son who was so unlike him with a wistful smile ! But although Billy Fiveash forms as great a contrast to his father as day to night, it is delightful to see how strong an attachment the old Commodore has for the gay sailor lad. His father is much more in the"], [392, "378 Wisdom and Courtesy. saloon since Billy came home, and never seems to weary of the never-ending tales which the youngster pours forth, without bragging a bit \u2014 unless of his ship, his captain, and his messmates \u2014 about foreign countries, strange men, wild animals, engagements with the French, storms and calms. After Billy Fiveash had distributed his presents all round he had a private conversation with Philly, and then he came and asked me as modestly as if he were not the liveliest of blue-eyed, chestnut-haired, handsome sailors, whether I would not do him the honour of accepting from my friend's brother one of the charming carved combs which I told you he had brought for Phiily and Penny. He had been appealing to Philly whether he might take the liberty of offering me a Spanish rosary, which was a little curious in its way, and which he was sorry to say was the sole trifle he had left. Philly had informed Billy that while she had the magnificent gow-n-piece he had brought her, Captain Ducat had already given her a comb almost the same as Penny's \u2014 and Philly was sure I admired Penny's comb. What could I say to this kind brother and sister but gratefully accept their gift, and promise that it should adorn my head, every time I wore my hair, while I had hair to wear ? I declare the good fellow notices the becoming contrast between the dark tortoiseshell and my \u2014 what shall I term them ? \u2014 even the Squire's par tiality would not make them out anything save red locks ; but in this instance they happen to match with the tortoiseshell as coral matches with it ; and he nods his"], [393, "Wisdom and Courtesy. 379 innocent approval every time I stick \" into my head \" the work of an artist ; for a genuine artist, though he might be of tawny skin, must have worked for days at the palm-trees and the long-tailed birds of my beautiful comb. I should not care for our boys seeing Billy Fiveash \u2014 the danger would be that they w-ould all turn sailors. As for the girls, they too would be captivated with his dash and joyousness, but not more than one of them could go after him to a foreign station, and it is to be hoped that she, for the credit of the sex, would be just the right one. I wonder if Billy Fiveash is always light and bright as the foam when the sun is flashing upon it, or if he has a shady side ? I cannot quite take to a lad even, however winning, who has not a shady side. I am sure that Billy Fiveash has a shady side, though he is young and light-hearted, and does not show the shade without occasion. The occasion was here, and when Billy was weighed in the balance he was not found wanting any more than the gravest, sternest man. A singular thing, which might have been a terrible thing, has befallen us in the course of my experience on board ship, but it is all over in peace and quiet, and we have no feelings to express but praise to God, who watches over us continually. We were all to have gone on a visit to Captain Ducat and the Zephyr yesterday \u2014 even the Commodore was to go \u2014 only Mrs. Fiveash, who has a weakness in one of her knee-joints, and hardly ever quits the Conqueror, was to remain at home. But I awoke with one of my sick headaches, of which the sea"], [394, "380 Wisdom and Courtesy. air has almost cured me. I begged to be left behind with Mrs. Fiveash, as I was not fit for the excursion, and would be a drag on the others. Penny entreated me to let her remain with me, but I would not suffer it, so dear Mrs. Fiveash and I had a nice day's rest together, during which, to our satislaction, we went over again her courtship and marriage, and the infancy and youth of all her children, especially of Billy and of poor Lewis, who was so unlike Billy. She was very graphic in her narratives, and I declare it was almost as good as being courted and married myself. I was so much recovered that I was quite able to pour out tea for Mrs. Fiveash as I do for my mother at home, when who should step in \u2014 or on board \u2014 but Mr. Billy, come back in the gig two hours earlier than the others, lest his mother and I should have wearied. After tea I went on deck with him for the air. As we leant over the rails admiring the orange sunset, suddenly I had a notion that I smelt a singed smoky smell. I told him, without thinking of anything serious in my speech, \" If I were on shore, now, I should say there were some careless folk letting their chimney go on fire there,\" and I pointed to a particular spot in the ship. He cried \" nonsense,\" but stopped short in what he was saying, and raised his head as he too smelt the faint smell of burning. In one instant he bent his smooth brows, set his merry mouth, and a clear dogged light came into his glancing eyes : \" Don't stir, Miss Prior, till I come back ; if I can, I'll be here again in a moment,\" and he was gone in the direction which I had indicated."], [395, "Wisdom and Courtesy. 381 Then it flashed upon me, when I saw his profile hard and white, relieved against the sunset, as he sprung below, that yonder, whence the smell of burning came, lay the powder-magazine. He was the hope and darling of his father and mother, the pride of his sisters, and even of Tom Fiveash \u2014 a bright, noble young fellow given to a family for its best treasure. His mother had told me all that, this very afternoon, and I thought of it when I questioned whether we should perish with him in the heroic daring of his effort to arrest, by entering the jaws of destruction, the ghastly evil which threatened many lives. I wondered, in the quickness of thought, how the news would travel to a quiet Kent vicarage, and what my friends would be doing when the tidings would strike them dumb. My prayers were frozen ; all that I could think of for him and me, for his mother in her uncon sciousness, and for the hardy sailors, men and boys, to whom a wild storm was but a welcome tussle with the elements of which they were the masters, was the evening prayer said in my father's voice in our country church. \" Lighten our darkness, we beseech thee, 0 Lord ; and by thy great mercy defend us from all perils and dangers of this night ; for the love of thy only Son, our Saviour, Jesus Christ. Amen.\" Was my father praying this prayer at that moment ? I did not stir from the spot where Billy had bidden me stay. He did not leave me many seconds, during which the night wind was kind, and was like a cool hand \u2014 my father's hand \u2014 lifting the damp hair from my temples, and keeping me from dropping down in a swoon and losing my"], [396, "382 Wisdom and Courtesy. senses. Billy came back very quietly, and spoke com posedly as men do when they refuse to make a fuss, or show their feelings, but his voice was low and his lip quivered. \" It is all right and safe, Miss Prior,\" he assured me. I asked him what had been wrong. It was only a stupid fellow who had been assisting in moving part of the stores (the powder), and though he ought not to have had a light there, had dropt a spark among some bagging in an awkward quarter; but he \u2014 Mr. Billy \u2014 had arrived in time to stamp out what had grown into a score of sparks, and the captain of the gunners, whom he had met, had finished the business with a wet blanket. \" But how well you behaved, Miss Prior !\" Billy flamed up, forgetting his determined depreciation of the danger. \" If you had made a row and detained me, nothing short of a miracle would have prevented all on board the Conqueror from being in eternity in a few moments. Even if the accident had got wind and thrown us into confusion, there is no saying how the matter might have ended. I, who am in the secret, shall always thank you for all our lives, and for my dear old mother's twice over. Had a whisper of the terrific danger reached her, with my father absent, I am certain it would have cost her life on the spot.\" Was not this turning the tables on me, and when I haJ done nothing in the world but mention the smell of burning and stand still ? Billy Fiveash laughed when I made this protest, and demanded whether I did not know that half of the battles of life were fought and won by standing where one was bidden and holding one's"], [397, "Wisdom and Courtesy. 383 tongue. I should have preferred if he had held his tongue afterwards, and I think, open as the day, and free as the wind, though he is in talk, he would have been silent where his own infinitely greater share of the exploit was concerned. But he was so full of what he chose to call my courage and self-command, that before many hours were over he had told the story in con fidence to every one in the ship whom he could get at to speak to, even to his mother. The consequence is that I have been overwhelmed with thanks and praise. Even Mr. Tom Fiveash has pulled up his collar and paid me a compliment for just holding my breath and standing still. Well, I shall at least be grateful to my dying day for having been of use, and for having been kept from doing mischief in an extremity \u2014 I shall also cherish to my dying day the remembrance of the moment when the Commodore patted my head as if I had been one of his daughters, and said briefly, \" My dear, you would not have been in my way on my island, yet I used to thank God that no women were there.\" But I would rather that no more was said of that night, I don't wish it to make too deep an impression on me. I feel ashamed and as if I were an impostor, when the brave old sailors who have come with honour out of a hundred battles and storms give me as it were the right hand of fellowship, by hailing me with congratu lations, \" Give you joy and our hearty thanks, miss, that you stood firm and did your duty \u2014 a slim lady and lass, no offence, though you be. Master Billy, we begs his"], [398, "384 Wisdom and Courtesy. pardon, the second lieutenant of the Cracken, he have told us, and mighty proud he do be of your behaviour, to be suie. The like may not happen on shipboard while the timbers of the Conqueror hold together, but, if we ever have a chance, we'll do as much for you.\" Philly's marriage is close at hand, and, do you know, I think it will not be long before there is another marriage in the family, from what I heard Philly and Captain Ducat say, when they seemed to forget that I was within hearing. I fancy Mr. Billy will marry soon, and that his friends have reason to be pleased with his choice, which is a wise, though a hasty one, like his father's. But I have not seen the young lady, to my know ledge, since I came here. Philly was telling Captain Ducat, as she was showing him the wedding favours, and I was writing at another table in the saloon, that there would be no reason for this couple waiting as Captain Ducat had done, since both were grown up, a young man and woman, and if they were of one mind and knew their mind, and could make the two ends meet, they might be as blithe as birds in a nest. \" And as poor as rats in a hole,\" Captain Ducat supple mented. \"Yes,\" Philly acquiesced fearlessly, \" for the smallest in come on which a married pair can get along is enough, when the pair are young and strong and have faith in promotion, in each other, and in God, as we have, Richard. But our friends will not be as poor as rats, any more than we shall ; for though Tom is Uncle Cornelius's heir, and will be the rich man of the family, which he is free to be, don't you"], [399, "Wisdom and Courtesy. 385 remember Billy has not been forgotten by his maternal grandfather, from whom he has inherited a tidy little addition to his pay?\" There was no mistaking Billy's mind, Philly added, and for her, she had wished the match from the beginning. She did not believe that the lady would say him nay, because it was Philly's firm conviction that the two were made for each other. No doubt Billy was a prettier man \u2014 in the Scotch forecastle-man's phrase \u2014 than she was a woman ; but for Philly's part, she considered her future sister, who had undeniably a good supple figure, an exceedingly comely girl, when one came to know her. Even Tom owned, at this date, that she had personal merits \u2014 a soft round cheek, and the pleasantest smile. Besides Philly held by the homely, pithy proverb, that \" handsome is as handsome does \" \u2014 she was the most intelligent, entertain ing, truest, most friendly girl. After that unutterably stilted and petted wax-doll, and mirror of fashion and folly, Cecilia Maynard, whom they had been in horror of Tom's going after, she was sufficient to redeem a man's opinion of women. Captain Ducat desired to say that his opinion of women, except in their employment of superlatives in applauding their friends and in abusing their foes, did not want to be redeemed. Neither did he stand in need of Philly's proclamation of her highly elegant proverb, as she was about to afford a convincing proof of her prin ciples with which he had no heart to quarrel \u2014 for once. But what did the Commodore think of this leap in the dark which Billy was to be so easily betrayed into taking? 2 C"], [400, "386 Wisdom and Courtesy. It was not a leap in the dark, neither was Billy betrayed, but led by his good genius into taking it. They were both led by the unerring beneficent hand of Providence, for Billy would be the most affectionate and faithful of husbands \u2014 with one exception. Philly's father said \u2014 let Captain Ducat hang his diminished head for his snarling, which was all pretence, because, as everybody knew, nobody had a higner opinion of the young lady than he had \u2014 that such a wife was all that Billy required. Captain Ducat owned that he really had the highest opinion of the young lady \u2014 with one exception. He wished he could help Billy to win her. Philly demurred at that, for naturally the sister could not see that the brother might soil in such a suit. I am of Philly's opinion. Billy Fiveash is not like a man who would be an unsuccessful wooer. Perhaps I shall see the young lady at the ball after the marriage \u2014 I am to leave the Conqueror and my kind friends the day after \u2014 I am sure I shall never forget any of the Fiveashes, but wish each and all of them, every happiness, always. Philly Fiveash is no more, she is Philly Ducat since yesterday, and I am adding a few additional lines to this journal-letter, which is certainly a log, instead of just sending my affectionate service to you and the Squire, and signing my name, before putting the letter up, in order to post it the first thing when I go ashore and start for home. It is all a mistake about Billy Fiveash's marriage \u2014 at least not about the marriage altogether, if all friends are pleased \u2014 as they cannot fail to be except for his profession, and one may learn to love the sea instead"], [401, "Wisdom and Courtesy. 387 of to dread it entirely, as I have found in my pleasant ex perience. The mistake was about the strange young lady, with regard to whom I fell into so foolish an error, and made myself so miserable for twenty-four hours. But I shall be home the day after to-morrow, and shall walk over to Elm Grange the next morning. And if I am not alone, you and the Squire will receive and welcome a friend for my sake, as well as for his own and his people's sakes. To be sure Billy was not unsuccessful in his suit \u2014 who could resist my sailor? You will take to your heart him who has made very happy your loving and faithful Susie Prior. P.S. \u2014 You told me that I had gone to seek my fortune, and I have found it. He says I must no longer call that a treacherous sea on which I found my fortune. Nor will I, though it has rocks and quicksands, and its waves can be lashed into relentless fury ; for the stormy wind fulfils His word, after the storm comes the calm, and at the end of every voyage lies \" the haven where the voyager would be.\" Note. \u2014 This letter was found among an old woman's treasures. It was carefully tied round with white riband, and docketed fondly, \" From my dear young friend, Susie Fiveash, on the happy occasion of her visit to the Conqueror, with the announcement of her marriage. The day after I received it the Squire and I rode into the town and bought her a silver tea-service, and a roquelaire lined with fur, for travelling.\""], [402, "388 XI. NOBLE SATISFACTION \" Give her os the fruit os her hands ; and let her own worki praise her in the gates.\" T^HERE is a heroine, to whom I may have alluded, who seems to have been connected with Greenwich long ago. She made a noise in the world and gained a high worldly prize. Lavinia Fenton went up to London, and played Polly Peacham to Captain Macheath, in the ' Beggar's Opera.' She was the rage of the town ; so that fine ladies sang her songs and borrowed her airs ; while she ended by wearing the strawberry leaves as Duchess of Bolton. The general impression of her is that she played a bold stroke for fortune, was not over-scrupulous in the means she used, nor over-sensitive as to the drawbacks in the attainment of her object. Let us not presume to judge this queen of pleasure and gaiety whose dust rests not for from that of a true hero, James Wolfe, in St Alphege's churchyard. She had temptations which happily do not befall many young girls and women ; she is not answerable to us for the degree in which she resisted or foiled in the strife. But, taking the fortune of Lavinia, Duchess of Bolton, at the best, and granting"], [403, "Noble Satisfaction. 389 that all which glittered in her lot, was gold, and not coarse tinsel, was hers, after all, the really satisfying portion in weakness as in strength, in old age as in youth ? Were hers truly the works which would praise her living and follow her dead ? I cannot think it \u2014 I cannot imagine that the rashest and most inexperienced of you girls can believe it. Let us sum up such good fortune \u2014 fine clothes, fine food, fine houses, and fine company, which, if it deigned to acknowledge a Polly Peacham, had for her the open or the covert taunt at her extraction, and at the buskin which she had worn to some purpose, and which her Bohemian heart loved. For more summing up, we have the envy, as well as the admiration of the crowd, the strain to keep up popularity and swell the ranks of her courtiers, the unweighed responsibilities which must have borne her down, or which she must have disowned in defiance, the alienation from early friends, from old habits and associations. Do these materials form the substance of which noble satisfaction is composed ? Would a good man \u2014 father or brother \u2014 court such gains for the daughter or the sister of his love because of the contentment and peace which they would bring ? \" Contentment and peace !\" the sim plest of you girls might cry in derision, \" better fretting discontent, and gnawing, ceaseless unrest.\" Yet I trust that neither you nor I, in order that we may be sensible and temperate in our opinions, would deliberately under value God's great gifts of wealth and rank \u2014 countless thousands and strawberry leaves\u2014 or would be mad enough and bad enough to condemn the possessors of"], [404, "Noble Satisfaction. 390 these gifts for the mere possession and enjoyment of God's bounty. But these, though they may be splendid opportunities for the exercise of the highest gifts, are not the veritable gifts ; and the career of a Lavinia Fenton may be wide as the poles from the career after which true women are bound to strive. All outward gifts, however excellent, and however excellently used, are but outward attributes, to be stripped off at death. Man or woman's true life consists not of the things which he possesses in money, rank, power, fame, learning, beauty, favour, strength, and youth. There is a deep, underlying con sciousness of this, which may escape you girls many times, but must visit you sometimes \u2014 in the gentlest and kindest intercourse of home and its affections, in scenes of un dreamt of beauty, when you are near to God in church, or brought face to face with Him in sudden danger, or sore sickness, or heart-breaking bereavement. Instead of Lavinia Fenton with her player's masque, and her duchess's coronet, I have tried to place before you some other girls and women, \u2014 heroines in their obscurity, as they might have lived and moved through the little stories of their lives in the place where her name yet lingers. I invite you to consider this question, bring ing it to the test of your most earnest moments. Boar in mind that the noble satisfaction of which I am now writing, and which may be secured, or may be renounced by any girl or woman of you all, is not a temporary but an abiding possession \u2014 part of your inner nature, of your very self, to carry with you into the spirit world, and to ripen in a perfect sphere."], [405, "Noble Satisfaction. 391 Dio. not this satisfaction belong rather to the heroines whom I have been endeavouring to hold up before you, than to Lavinia Fenton, so far as we know her? We may ask the question without seeking to cast stones at one who may have leamt her hard lesson, and been sar rowful and humble in her way. Is it not good for you and me to reflect on such satisfaction ? Would it not be part of these simple heroines' reward to realize this satisfaction when their hearts were foiling because of what was coming upon them, when they were sad, or sorry, or feeble, or forlorn, or very old ? Polly Culpepper vindicated the trustworthiness which had grown into her very nature. Joan Walton exhibited single-hearted magnanimity in seasons of trial. Jenny Pettet overcame her desultory waste of time and character. Margaret Copeland's daring and determination were a strong tower to her and her kin. Thirza Holland's method and precision, though they were all but driven into the excess of punctiliousness, worked a deliverance for her husband. Judith Thynne's vigour of bodily and mental constitution, exercised in a good cause, stemmed the tide and lifted her above her crosses to ultimate victory. Cassandra Fuller's sweet, wifely endurance lit up the darkness of poverty, making the worst the best, through evil report, unto death. Tilly Bond was born again, under the vivifying sun of Christiana Apsley's charity, into a brighter, gladder world of middle life and declining age than she had known in her heathen youth. Bennet Le Strange's bounty, which had patient self-denial and love at its core, was kept from all taint"], [406, "Noble Satisfaction. 392 and corruption of pride and vain-glory. Susie Prior practised the wisdom and courtesy which were to her the best beauty. Are not such doings among the works *-hich will praise women in the gates, and follow the dead who die in the Lord ? All women may not have husbands to praise them, or children to rise up and call them blessed. All women are not even free, literally, to entertain strangers and bring up children ; but all women, if they will be good women, can and must show their faith by their works. What girl or woman would desire to stand in her place, at last, empty-handed ? The summons is to work while it is called to-day, to obtain a good report ; and while no worker receives the full reward here, to go forth and receive the crown yonder.
