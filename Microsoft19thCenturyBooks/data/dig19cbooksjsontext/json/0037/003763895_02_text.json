TN this volume, as in the volume preceding it, my object is not simply to enumerate causes and to discourse about them, but to present them along with the facts in which they exist as living influences. It is my wish that no other book should be needed to enable the reader to realize the purpose for which the present book is written. But my narrative is neces sarily constructed on a principle of selection. Facts have their place in it from their relation to change and progress ; and those so related in the greatest degree, are made the most prominent. In looking back on what I. have written, I see that in the chapter on the reformed doctrine in England, before the meeting of the Reformation Parliament, I should have acknowledged my obligation to Merle DAubigne in pointing my attention to some facts connected with the life of Erasmus, with which I might not otherwise have become acquainted ; and no writer can traverse the first half of the sixteenth century in our history in the time to come, without feeling indebted to the industry of Mr. Froude. All"], [12, "VI PREFACE. the printed authorities, however, consulted by that gentleman, I have, I believe, myself examined ; and in the degree which seemed necessary for my design, I have extended my investigations to the manuscripts in the Rolls Office. On some of the points in which Mr. Froude's judgment concerning the past differs from that of his predecessors, he appears to me to have war rant for the new ground he has taken ; but on some others, and those the most material, I have not been able to see evidence as he has seen it. Mr. Froude, however, will know how to cede to a fellow-labourer in the same field the independence which he has himself claimed. The present volume, it will be obvious, must be concerned with characters and events which have been the ground of much controversy. My own convic tions as a Protestant, and as a friend of free insti tutions, are settled and strong. But in writing this work, it has been my earnest wish to write as an Englishman, and to commend myself, to the best of my ability, to sound English sense and English feel ing, irrespective of sect or party. In the autumn of my life, Providence has given me comparative leisure, and in the present publication, I am endeavouring to write the kind of history of which I felt the want in my youth, and which has long been before my mind as the work with which I have hoped to occupy some of my riper years.

NATIONALISTS AND ROMANISTS. CHAPTER I. HENRY VIII. AND WOLSEY. IN a preceding volume my subject has been she ad- book ' mixtures of race in English history, and the changes C'\"AP\" produced by them. My aim has been to describe those \u00b0ri8ij\u00bb \u00ab races, to show how they were distributed on the soil people.\" of this country, and how they were at length welded together so as to become the great English people. Through more than twelve centuries the revolu tions in our history came from the conquests and the settlements of new peoples. The men of the Celtic race, with their restless sensibility, their vivid imagina tion, and their soul of fire ; the Saxon, with his graver foresight, his rooted bravery, and his sense of social right ; and the Norman, with a strength like that of the old Roman, a strength to conquer and to rule, \u2014 all these had their work to do in making England what she was when the great revolutions in her history came to be Revolutions in Religion. Religion is a great want of man, as truly so as food Religion and clothing. We speak of the fine arts as distinctive tory. of a state of civilization. But the rudest savage has his sense of ornament. So we never fail to find reli gion, in some form, wherever we find humanity. The wants of our nature in regard to social life and religious life have the same spontaneous origin, and develop themselves according to the same laws. When a II B"], [24, "2 NATIONALISTS AND ROMANISTS. BOOK VI Chap, i. Religious Revolutions in England. people once come under influences favourable to pro gress, it is natural that they should go on from bad to better, and from better to better still. It is so with religion \u2014 even with revealed religion. There are social influences by which even that may be deterio rated, and others by which it may be purified and elevated. Motives coming from our physical and moral nature contribute alike to make intelligence progressive ; and the growth of intelligence tends, in its turn, to ensure a growth of cultivated feeling. So men come by degrees to have new convictions in regard to tbe just in social life, and to the true and pure in religious life, and are prepared to endure much, and to dare much, in defence of such convictions. It is a narrow philosophy, a philosophy falsely so called, which contents itself with holding up the igno rance, the prejudice, and the intolerance too often found in religious men as demonstrating that every thing belonging to the history of religion must be contemptible or vicious. The folly and crime which belong to the history of civil government do not de monstrate that government itself is a folly and a crime. The evils of bad government may be great, but the evils of no government would be greater. Horrors have been perpetrated in the name of religion : and what horrors have not been perpetrated in the name of order and liberty ? The susceptibilities of religious thought and feeling in man which have made errors connected with religion possible, are from the Creator. Kings and priests do not create them, could not eradi cate them. They are inseparable from humanity ; and the presumption is strong, that a capacity so distinc tive of human nature, must be destined to be tributary to whatever is noblest in the history of the race. In man we have never to do with the perfect, but always with the more or less imperfect. In the narrative before us we shall meet with many things which modern thought will account as religious folly or religious crime. But this struggle between"], [25, "3 HENRY VIII. AND WOLSEY. opposing convictions was a conflict in which the feel- book vi ing of the combatants often rose high above the little- C\"AF\" '' ness and selfishness of ordinary life. In those days a stern antagonism to error was accounted by religious men as inseparable from a real conviction of truth. It may be perplexing to us that nations and churches should have to learn the lessons necessary to their growth by passing through long stages of misconcep tion and misdeeds. But it is by such slow and unequal steps that the just and wise obtain their destined ascendancy in the history of mankind. The time had now come in which England was to learn her great lesson in religion, and we shall see in her course the common admixture of good and evil. Under a con fused surface it will be easy to trace the presence of fervent moral and religious motive, striving towards a much higher standard, both in religion and morals, than had yet been reached. Politicians did their work ; but religious men had a greater work to do, and it was done. Under influences which were but dimly apprehended at the time, it became the resolve of the Teutonic race in Europe, and especially of English men, that their religion should no longer be something external and artificial, but something inward and real ; and to men of this temper England owes her Pro testantism, and her place in relation to Protestant Christendom during the latter half of the sixteenth century. The history of England from the accession of the house of Tudor to the Revolution of 1688, is the history of a people committed to the work of self renovation; and the fixedness of purpose, and the ultimate success, with which this object was prosecuted, were such as might well lead us to regard them as a people who were guided and sustained in their great enterprise by an Eternal Providence. The present chapter will embrace a general view of English history from the accession of Henry VIII. to the fall of Wolsey. Henry VII. died in the fifty-third year of his age, Death or and in the twenty-second of his reign. His funeral H\u00b0X\u00bb. B 2"], [26, "4 NATIONALISTS AND ROMANISTS. BOOK VI. Chap. i. Early years of Henry VIII. was a grand ceremony, bespeaking the wealth both of the king and of the kingdom. Its pageantries were more elaborate and costly than anything of the kind that had been known in our history. Six hundred torches lined the streets through which the procession passed after nightfall. When the body was lowered into its resting-place in Westminster Abbey, the Lord Treasurer, the Lord Steward, the Lord Chamberlain, and the Comptroller of the king's household, all broke their staves, and cast them into the vault. Whereupon, Garter King-at-arms cried with a loud voice, ' Long ' live king Henry VIII., king of England, France, ' and Ireland.' Our authority adds : ' Wonder it were ' to write of the lamentation that was made for this ' prince among his servants, and others of the wiser ' sort; and the joy that was made for his death by * such as had been troubled by the rigour of his law. ' Vet the toward hope which in all points appeared in ' the young king, did comfort the heavy hearts of those ' who had lost so wise a prince, and also did put out ' of the minds of such as were relieved by the said ' king's death all their old grudge and rancour.'* The deceased king promised on his deathbed an amnesty to all offenders, except such as were under the charge of treason, murder, or felony ; and ordered that money should be given to persons confined in certain prisons for small debts, sufficient to release them. The young monarch strengthened the popular feeling in his favour by confirming the will of his pre decessor in these particulars.! Everywhere, indeed, the accession of the new king was hailed with an im passioned loyalty. The first two years of this reign were years of peace. But the tastes and amusements of the king, which as a matter of course became those of the nobility and the people, were in a high decree warlike. Mock encounters with the sword, the battle- * Hall's Chronicle, 555\u2014557. t Herbert's Life and Reign of Henry VIII. 1-3."], [27, "HENRY VIII. AND WOLSEY. 5 ,t axe, and other weapons, in which the monarch took book yi. his part, and was always declared to be victorious, C\"AP ' called forth applause from the queen, the ladies, the foreign ambassadors, and from crowds of spectators. The history, indeed, of those young days of royalty consists almost entirely in the history of such spec tacles, and of revels in the palace when the season was not favourable to such scenes in the open air. Henry's acquirements as a scholar, his manly presence, and his thorough English feeling, disposed his people to asso ciate almost every virtue with qualities in which there was so much to admire. How far such an estimate of the character of this memorable person was well founded will appear as we proceed. So far back as the year 1496, prince Arthur, the Marriage a eldest son of Henry VII., had been promised in mar-^unr\"Ar\" riage to Catherine, the fourth daughter of Ferdinand, king of Castile and Aragon. The prince at that time was not more than twelve years of age. When he had entered on his fifteenth year, it was decided that the marriage should take place. The princess landed at Plymouth. The ceremony was performed isoi. in St. Paul's. Great was the holiday-making in court and city on the occasion. The prince was amiable, in telligent, and beloved ; but his health began to fail soon after his marriage, and he died at his residence, >5\u00b0* in Ludlow castle, when he had not been more than four months a husband. It was expected that Catherine would now return Henry w to Spain. But the importance of placing a check on cthenne. the power of France, which had led to this marriage, was still felt. It was accordingly proposed that the widowed princess should be betrothed to Henry, and so still be the wife of the heir-apparent to the English throne. For this purpose it would be necessary to obtain a dispensation from the pope, marriage with the wife of a deceased brother being marriage within the prohibited degrees. But the militant pontiff, Julius II., had political interests at this juncture in"], [28, "6 NATIONALISTS AND ROMANISTS. BOOK VI. [IAP. J 5oS June 28. Character os Cathe- rine, common with Spain, and was prepared to^ make almost any sacrifice to secure the good offices of England. The required dispensation was accordingly granted, and Henry and Catherine were betrothed. But this measure had been opposed, both on religious and political grounds, by Wareham, archbishop of Canterbury, and considerable uneasiness was felt in relation to it. The king himself became dissatisfied with it, fearing that a doubtful marriage, entailing a doubtful succession, might lead to a renewal of the miseries that had been attendant on the late civil wars. Influenced by this feeling, the king determined to relieve himself from the responsibility he had incurred, and on the day when the prince became of age, he required him to declare, in the presence of Fox, bishop of Winchester, and of many of the nobility, that he would not proceed in the said marriage, but intended, ' in full form of law, to void it, and break it.' Henry made this declaration ' fairly and of his own accord,' and his father upon his deathbed besought him to act upon it. But the councillors of the young king knew the nation to be exceedingly desirous of retaining their commercial relations with Spain and the Low Countries ; and were not unmindful, probably, that Catherine had brought 200,000 ducats with her as her jointure. In conformity with their advice, Henry became the husband of Catherine of Aragon.* The character of this ill-fated princess contrasted too strongly with that of her second husband to afford any large promise of happiness. In the love of litera ture, the king and queen possessed a taste in common ; and there were times when Henry seemed to regard the piety of Catherine with a feeling of reverence. Her religion, however, was of a kind that would have qualified her for the head of a convent, better than for the head of a court. She had entered the third order * Herbert's Life of Henry VIII. 24, 116, 117. Burnet's Hist. Res. i. 62-65. Hardwick, State Papers, i. 1-20. Rymer, xiii. 81-80."], [29, "HENRY VIII.

Saturday and Sunday were her fast-days, and on the vigils of the Virgin she took only bread and water. In the middle of the night she rose to repeat her prayers, and by five in the morning she left her chamber dressed for the day. Six hours every morning were spent in church, her. knees bent for long intervals on the bare floor. Twice a week all her feelings and thoughts were unbosomed to her confessor. When dinner was over, two hours were given to reading the lives of the saints. On these oc casions her maids were with her, to be edified by her reading, her counsel, and her example. What time remained was occupied with reading or prayer, until the hour for supper, which was always a simple repast. So the day ended. Henry was a man of religious con viction and feeling ; but a wide gulf separated between the queen's temperament and his own on that subject. In many other respects the divergence between them was great * The wise and pious dowager-countess of Richmond, who had been the great educator of Henry VII., lived long enough to influence the course of Henry VIII. on his accession to the throne. f In accordance with her advice, the men who had been found trust worthy by the late king were retained as servants of the crown by his successor.

It CHAP- '\u2022 was a misfortune that there was no sound constitu- tional lawyer among them. It had been the policy of Henry VII. to make but a limited use of parliaments. The nobility had become few and suspected ; and the commons, standing alone, were not strong enough to make themselves formidable. Hence, the ministers of the crown, from the accession of Henry VII. to the middle of the reign of Henry VIII., seem to have little thought about those constitutional rights which had been won by Englishmen in past time. The people, as we shall see, retained feelings and traditions on this subject which seem to have almost died out among their rulers. Such was the political atmosphere in which Henry VIII. found himself on his accession. As a rule, the council were careful to be agreed upon their measures before submitting them to the king. Henry left affairs considerably in their hands ; but from the first, he was much more attentive to his kingly duties than has been commonly supposed ; and during the greater part of his life he was most assiduous in that respect, and rarely so guided by the judgment of others as to relinquish his own. State papers, pub- lished and unpublished, place this fact beyond dispute. Hemy vii. Almost the first business that devolved on the ments in council was of a nature to test their wisdom and money- fidelity. The late king had been too much possessed their pu- wfth the idea that to diminish the wealth of the great mshinent. iis\u00bbi men, and to increase the wealth of the crown, tended eminently to the safety of the state. In pursuance of this policy, he had issued a commission to ascertain how far certain claims of the crown relating to feudal tenures had been neglected of late years. It was known beforehand, that in consequence of the irregu larities of all sorts which had been introduced and perpetuated by the civil wars, the men of property who might be convicted of neglect in such matters were very many. It was possible, accordingly, to exact large sums, in the way of fines and confiscations, under"], [31, "HENRY VIII. AND WOLSEY. 9 BOOK VI. Chap. i. such pretences. The men who especially undertook to work this commission, were two barons of the exchequer, named Empson and Dudley \u2014 the former a man of low origin, who did the bidding of the latter, and who employed a number of subordinates to do his own bidding. By adopting the most inquisitorial methods of inquiry, and by means of packed or inti midated juries, money was obtained to an enormous extent. But, as will be supposed, it was at the cost of filling the country with loud complaints. The king had good reason to believe that the cry thus raised against the rapacity of his officers was not with out foundation ; and one of the penitent acts of his last hours, was to require that compensation should be made by the government to all persons who could show that the proceedings of the commissioners towards them had been unjust or harsh. Proclama tion was made to this effect, and the result was such an outburst of disclosure and denunciation that Empson and Dudley were immediately put under arrest. Empson pleaded that he had simply executed laws which his accusers had never attempted to repeal, and that for ' the whole frame of his proceeding' he had the warrant of the king. It was insisted, how ever, that he had abused the king's authority, and had strained even bad laws so as to have made them worse. For awhile ihe two delinquents were lodged in the Tower. Subsequently they were charged with treason. The charge was based on very doubtful evidence ; but it served its purpose. Juries convicted them. Both were beheaded. Some of their instru ments were placed in the pillory, and all died of the treatment to which they were exposed. Empson and Dudley may have been bad men, chargeable not only with injustice, but with cruelty ; but the law, loose as it was in those times, was manifestly strained when it was made to convict them of treason. The most material circumstance in the indictment against them was, that they were accused of having written,"], [32, "10 NATIONALISTS AND ROMANISTS. BOOK VI, Chap. i. Continental politics \u2014 state of Italy. Dudley to nine persons, and Empson to seventeen, urging them to come armed to London, in the event of the king's death, and the names of the persons were given. On this fact, the charge was founded, of an intention 'to destroy the king, and to depose, remove, ' and deprive him of his royal authority.'* _ But it had become expedient that the popular indignation should be appeased by the death of these offenders, and in this instance, as in many more during this reign, what could not be legally proved, was accomplished by means of inventions or appearances which were made to pass for such proof. In continental politics, on the accession of Henry VIII., Spain and France were the great competitors for power, and Italy was the country towards which their ambitious schemes were especially directed. Italy was the residence of the supreme pontiff, who was supposed to sway the spiritual forces of Christen dom ; and influence in that quarter was of great im portance on that ground. Italy, moreover, while separated from Spain and France by seas or moun tains, was near enough to be accessible to both, and was always sufficiently isolated, and weakened by internal dissension, to become an easy prey to such formidable neighbours. In addition, it was accounted a great honour to rule where the masters of the old world had ruled, and France and Spain alike felt, that if one were only absent, the other would naturally rise to that eminence. In this strife, the two powers spared no pains to strengthen themselves by alliances, * MS. Rolls Office, Baga de Secretis, pouch iv.

AND WOLSEY. and as the assistance of England, from its pecuniary book vi. resources, if not from its military power, was especially C\"AP\" '' prized, this country was drawn considerably into the vortex of Italian politics. Henry was flattered by the notion, that if he could not act as a chief in this con test, he might hold the rank of umpire in relation to those who were such. In the meanwhile, the condi tion of the country whose cities and provinces were the prize sought by the belligerents, was most pitiable. Beautiful were many of those provinces, and rich were those cities in all that constituted the advanced culture of the age. Michael Angelo and Raphael, Dante and Ariosto, had contributed all that genius of the highest order could supply to give refinement and splendour to Italian life. Every street bespoke the national taste. Every palace exhibited that taste in higher development than had been witnessed since the days of Pericles. But the country of great poets and painters, of great sculptors and architects, was not the country of great patriots. The \u00e6sthetic susceptibilities were highly trained ; the more homely and manly virtues, which alone make nations great, were despised. Sensuousness and selfishness fell there, as from the wand of an enchanter, upon all men. City was jealous of city, and man was jealous of man. All was isola tion. The union which gives strength did not exist \u2014 was not possible. The usual effects followed. The country suffered from all comers \u2014 was at the mercy of all. The year before the accession of Henry VIII. the warm memorable league of Cambray had been formed. The I\u00a3J|; great agent in calling this confederation into existence Dec was the warlike pontiff Julius II. Its purpose was to humble the pride of Venice, which menaced the in dependence of the other states of Italy, not excepting those of the papal see. France, Austria, and Spain were parties to this compact, and each power stipulated for the portion of the Italian territory that should fall to it, as the result of the conjoint enterprise. The"], [34, "12 NATIONALISTS AND ROMANISTS. book vi. object of this undertaking was soon realized, and be- c^!_1' came the source of no little disquietude and suffering to the Italians for a long time to come. The Venetians sought the friendship of Julius, and the pontiff pleaded the intervention of England, and other considerations, Feu'iz as reasons for concluding a separate treaty with that republic. The consequence of this proceeding was a rupture between France and the papacy. The French arms soon became so successful as to promise to be ascendant everywhere south of the Alps. Julius suc- ceeded in persuading Ferdinand of Spain, Maximilian of Germany, and the king of England, that this aggrandizement of France could not be to their interest, and secured all these powers as allies against Louis. >5n. Henry was flattered with being declared the 'Head of ' the Italian League' thus formed, and the title of ' Most Christian King' was to be taken from the crown of France and attached to the crown of England. In short, England was to renew her claim to the soil of France, and to enter on a new career of military glory in that country.* Failure of Ferdinand and Henry engaged to assail Guienne and of the ' with their combined forces by sea and land.

As the autumn wore away, the last remnants of the French army were driven from the Italian soil. Julius did not long enjoy this much-coveted triumph. He died in the following February, and was succeeded by Leo X.* Having unsheathed the sword against France, it was not probable that Henry would allow his relations with that country to be settled on the basis of a campaign so little satisfactory as that of 1512. In the following spring an alliance was formed between France and Venice. Opposed to it was another league, to which Ferdinand, Maximilian, Leo X., and Henr}', were all parties. In the former year, Ferdinand had played false that he might seize the province of Na varre. This year he pursued the same course, that he might retain his hold of that valuable acquisition. Henry vested the regency of England in queen Catherine. The English army marshalled on the French soil amounted to 15,000 men. The earl of Shrewsbury and lord Herbert had preceded the king, with their respective divisions of this force ; and when his majesty landed with the last contingent, those commanders were engaged in the siege of Terouanne in Picardy. Maximilian paid a visit to the king of England near the walls of that city, with 4000 horse. Henry went out to meet the emperor, richly attired, and with a retinue of persons hardly less splendid in their apparel, and in the trappings of their steeds. But the rain fell heavily, and it was observed that the very plain suit of the emperor, and the ordinary cos tume of his attendants, happened to be much more in place on so foul a day than the display of the English. The emperor flattered the vanity of Henry, and consulted his own convenience, by accepting the payment of 100,000 crowns daily for his services, as the voluntary soldier of the English crown. So early does the interference of England in continental disputes * Guicciardini, Hist. bk. x. xi. Herbert, 8-11."], [36, "14 NATIONALISTS AND ROMANISTS. come to be an interference based on her exchequer. Maximilian returned to his field of operations at Aire, and Henry resumed his place in the entrenchments before the besieged town. Six weeks passed and the English army was still before Terouanne. The eager expectation of the English people had not been realized. Henry VIII. had done nothing to remind them of the glories of Henry V. The German auxiliaries became weary and disaffected. Their quarrels with the English came to blows, and cannon were discharged between them. It required the presence of Maximilian to restore order. The people in the besieged town, and the French army which hovered in the distance, were apprised of these occurrences. Meanwhile, the distress of the towm became great, and the French in the field saw no prospect of being able to relieve it without hazarding an engagement. This was at length resolved upon. On the morning of the sixteenth of August a de tachment of French cavalry appeared on the neigh bouring hills. The English army consisted almost wholly of infantry, the French now in sight wholly of cavalry. The small body of cavalry at the disposal of the king of England moved in advance of the in fantry, and the advanced cavalry of the French re treated slowly towards the army in their rear. But the English cavalry, though few, even in comparison with the force which was retiring before them, broke away from the infantry, and rushed upon the enemy with the old English cry of ' God and St. George !' The Frenchmen, after a spirited but short resistance, fled in the greatest disorder. The English followed. Both spurred their steeds as if for their lives, and the light-hearted Gauls gave the name of 'the Battle of ' the Spurs' to the encounter which came to such a ter mination. Had there been a general of adequate capacity in the English camp, this success would have been followed up, and the result might have been dis astrous to France.

Tournay, an C\"AF\" '\" inland town of no value, without a garrison, and with feeble means of defence, was also captured; and with this performance a campaign from which so much had been expected came to its close. Its only important Henry result was to show, that if the military arrangements proves, hap of Europe were to be materially disturbed, it would beamiiV'' not be as the consequence of any military genius pos- tar)' genius sessed by the present king of England. This was not a welcome discovery to Englishmen, but it was a fact pregnant with happy consequences. Louis died in the following year. His successor was Francis I.* If the arms of England achieved little during the Disagree campaign of 15 13 in France, something memorable [^\"scots' was accomplished by them in that year nearer home. James IV. of Scotland, had married Henry's sister Margaret, but was suspected of being more disposed towards an alliance with France than with England, notwithstanding this family relationship. Henry, before leaving England, had sent envoys to Scotland, in the hope of ensuring the fidelity of his kinsman during his absence. James spoke of having none but the most friendly feelings towards the king of Eng land, and of being very desirous to remain neutral in regard to this difference between him and the king of France. But when pressed to pledge himself to this line of policy in a satisfactory form, James urged excuses, and the distrust which had prompted this pro posal was not removed. f It soon became known that James had entered into negotiations with Louis, and had signed a treaty which bound him to make war upon England, so soon as Henry should have become the invader of France. James alleged that Henry had detained jewels in his possession which had been bequeathed to Margaret by her father ; that he had dealt with certain men of the name of Barton as * Herbert, 15, 16. t Ellis's Letters, 1st Series, i. 64-78.

The point about the queen's jewels was an obscure matter, and hardly an affair to be settled by the sword;* the Bartons, if not licensed to act as pirates, had certainly become such ;f and the case of Sir Robert Ker, accordingly, was the only circumstance that could be adduced with any show of reason as warranting so grave a proceeding as an appeal to arms. The man charged with that deed of violence had been outlawed. But that was not deemed enough. All men, however, knew suffi- ciently well, that the true cause of the threatened hostilities was to be found in those feelings between the two nations which had so often placed them in deadly antagonism to each other \u2014 feelings which had always been deriving strength in the mind of the Scotch from the idea that the weakness of England must be the safety of Scotland. On all the grievances alleged, Henry maintained that 'reasonable answer, ' founded upon law and conscience,' had been made before the Scottish king and his council. James iv. James sent a herald to Henry, while before the war against walls of Terouanne, to renew the above complaints, England. an(j caji Up0n rifm to retire without delay from the soil of the king of France, threatening war in case of a refusal.

He denounced the course taken by James as perfidious and base, as only too much like what the conduct of the men from whom he had descended had always been towards England. But * This alleged bequest is not found in Henry's will.

He would not find England un prepared to meet him. Let him take warning from the king of Navarre, who must needs be a partisan of Louis, and had ceased to be a king.* Before this epistle could reach Scotland, James was in arms, and a hundred thousand men, who flocked to his standard on Burrow Moor, testified to the feeling in which the war had originated. Of this multitude many fell away. But the army with which James crossed the Tweed was the most formidable that Scotland had ever sent into England. Norham, Wark, Etal, and Ford, all places of strength along the English border, surrendered to the invader. The earl of Surrey summoned the northern counties Prepara to the standard of their king. Some twenty-five English\u2014'6 thousand men, about half the number of the invading strategy of O, Hie livo ar army, were promptly obedient to his call. Many ol miea. these men were not unacquainted with border war fare, and all were intent upon showing their estimate of the bad blood which had prompted an onslaught upon their country at such a moment. Surrey was not unknown to the king of Scotland. He had ac companied Margaret into that country at the time of her marriage, and was in great favour, it seems, on that occasion, with James. f He now sent a mes- sage to the king, challenging him to an engagement on the following Friday. James answered the mes sage courteously, accepting the challenge; but re moved immediately to a strong position on the side of the Flodden hill, one of the Cheviot range, which overlooked the vale of Tweed. In taking that ground * Halliwell's Letters of the Kings of England, i. 216-219. t Ellis's Letters, 1st Series, i. 41.

Chap. i. the king had a heavy marshy soil to his right, the circle of the Cheviot hills to his left, the only access to him being through a moderately open space below, and there he had planted his artillery. Surrey com plained that, by so disposing of his army, the king, instead of accepting a challenge on equal terms, had done all he could to render an engagement of any kind impossible. James, however, deemed it sufficient to reply that he should wait for the promised attack of the English on the given day. Surrey was annoyed on finding himself so placed. To assail the enemy as thus lodged would be to fight under the most perilous disadvantages, while his declining to do so would be construed as a failure of his pledge. His brave son, the lord admiral, had the merit of rescuing him from this dilemma. He advised that the English army should march towards Scotland, and that, wheel ing about at some distance, they should return along the hill side, and descend upon their enemies from the high ground in their rear. The march com menced. James became alarmed. He was led to fear that the object of this movement was to ' burn and ' forage the plentiful country called the Marche.'* In the direction the English were taking lay Bramston hill, an important position, of which it was supposed they would be eager to possess themselves. James resolved, if possible, to seize that eminence before them, and gave order that a large mass of camp stuff should be set on fire. The wind so drifted the smoke thus raised, that it rolled along the track between the two armies as they were moving in the same direction \u2014 the Scotch on the high ground and the English on the lower, concealing them from each other, though often no great distance apart. When the smoke cleared away, the advanced body of the English found themselves at the foot of Bramston hill, with the Scots, marshalled in four battalions, on the hio-h * Hall, 561."], [41, "HENRY VIII. AND WOLSEY. 19 ground above them. The lord admiral, who com- book vi. manded this advanced division, knew that the force at Chaf\" '\u2022 his disposal could not be expected to keep its ground against the odds opposed to it. He took his Agnus dei from his neck, and sent it by a swift messenger to his father, urging him to come to his side with the bat talion at his command as speedily as possible. It happened that this could be soon done; and at the foot of Bramston hill the English army was arranged in order of battle, forming a line from west to east, with their backs towards the north \u2014 thus placing themselves as a living wall between Scotland and the Scotchmen. The English were still at disadvantage as to position. They were certainly not much more than half the number of their enemies ; and from the hurry of their coming together, and of their march, they had now been two days without food. But the two countries had come face to face, and had their work to do. The Scots begin to descend from the hill. They Battle of do so without noise. Presently the artillery on both 1513\u2122 sides begin to play. But the discharge of the Scotch Sept- 8' does no damage. The master-gunner of the English, on the contrary, sweeps away the master-gunner of the enemy, and all who are serving with him, and then sends a destructive fire into the midst of the battalion commanded by the king. The artillery arm of the Scotch being thus broken, the four battalions advance towards the English lines, and everywhere the fight becomes a fight hand to hand. The face of the English is towards the south. Seen from their rear, their right wing is on the extreme west, and is com manded by Sir Edmund Howard, the second son of the earl of Surrey. The next division, stretching eastward, is under the command of the earl's eldest son, the lord admiral. The next battalion in the same direction, forming the main body of the army, is led by the earl himself; and the left wing, in the extreme east, is entrusted to Sir Edward Stanley. c 2"], [42, "20 NATIONALISTS AND ROMANISTS. BOOK VI Chap. i. The charge from the Scots upon the right wing, by a host of spearmen, some ten thousand strong, is so overwhelming, that the English ranks, after awhile, are seen to yield. Their leader, Sir Edmund Howard, is three times beaten to the ground. But Heron, a border chieftain, with a rude band of followers, comes to his aid. ' Never was lord's son ' nearer death than you have been,' cries Heron ; ' but, \u25a0 though my own wounds are not slight, while I can ' stand I will be at your side.' Heron rallies his men, and prolongs resistance, until lord Dacre, with a reserve of fifteen hundred horse, comes to his aid, and then the face of the field near the right wing is changed. The Scots opposed to the second division, under the command of the lord admiral, are led by the earls of Errol, Huntley, and Crawford, and are not less than seven thousand in number. Deadly is the strife in that quarter. The men meet in silence. Little is heard save the stroke of their weapons, or the cry from the wounded. All are intent upon the death-blows they can deal. Hundreds fall ; the living stride over the bodies of the dead and dying in their strife. But, one by one, the earls and the great men among the Scots are struck down, until resistance becomes faint, and flight ensues. Then the loud shout is raised by the victors. While affairs are in this course with the vanguard and the west wing, the battalion under Surrey is opposed to the king himself with the flower of his army, thousands of whom are clothed in mail, which long resists the arrows and weapons of the English. The courage of the king, and of his devoted adherents, is great, steady, such as seems to promise suc cess. Surrey does all that man can do, with his brave Englishmen, against such odds and disadvantage. But the Scots are gaining upon him. They have fought their way nearer and nearer towards the royal standard. It is not known that the success of the English in the other parts of the field has been such as to allow of their coming to the aid of this division."], [43, "21 HENRY VIII. AND WOLSEY. BOOK VI. Chap. i. But at this crisis Sir Edward Stanley is seen descend ing the hill lately occupied by the Scots, and is about to fall upon the rear of the king's force. In their ad vance towards the left wing the Scots have been signally galled by the English archers. Stanley has availed himself of their confusion to throw them into rout, and has chased the division commanded by the earls of Argyle and Lennox from the field, and over the opposite hill. He is now returning from the pur suit, and lord Dacre, with his reserve of horse, and the lord admiral, are ready to join him. And now the day is won ! The king of Scotland, on foot with his followers, falls under the weapons of his assailants. His nobles, and the ecclesiastics in his train, are strewed everywhere about him. The Scots are all in flight. The English have not cavalry to pursue the fugitives, and they are exhausted with hunger and fatigue. But a chase there is, and the moment of discomfiture brings death like a flood upon the van quished. Twelve thousand Scotsmen lie on that field. The loss in killed to the English is not a tenth of that number. This difference must not be attributed to auy difference in courage between the two nations. It must be traced, in part to inequalities in military skill, and in part to those accidents which often do so much to determine the issue of such encounters. The Scotch camp was found to be well stored with provisions ; and through that memorable September night the English slept on the field which their steady bravery, and their experience in war, had made to be a great landmark in British history. The battle commenced soon after four o'clock in the afternoon, and extended itself at once to all parts of the field. In little more than an hour it was over. Scotland, happily for both countries, is not to take ground against England in such force in the time to come.* * Hall, 55I-563. Gait's Life of Wolsey, app. 333 et seq.

Louis, in the cSfon- meanwhile, if not successful in the field, became suc princees8sthe cessful in diplomacy. During the ensuing winter he Mary. convinced Henry that neither Ferdinand nor Maximi- lian was to be trusted as a confederate. He made his use of the pacific preferences of the new pontiff, Leo X. ; and he so far prevailed on the powers lately in arms to accept terms, that, before the close of the year, he became the husband of the princess Mary, sister to the king of England. The princess was young and beautiful ; Louis was old and infirm, and died a few months after the nuptials. It is one of the misfor- tunes of royalty, that in marriage, reasons of state commonly take precedence of all other reasons. Mary was subsequently wedded to the duke of Suffolk, an accomplished nobleman, who had been the object of her affection before she had given her hand to the French king.* QaUreetnandr Scotland, though by no means disposed to prosecute affairs in its war with England, did not soon become tranquil. Margaret, in pursuance of the will of the late king, became regent, in favour of her son, then in the second year of his age. Six months after the death of her husband she gave birth to a second son. Only three months later, she married the earl of Angus, a young nobleman too much wanting in the power of self-government to govern others. This ill-advised step gave strength to the French faction in the Scottish not all strictly agreed in their descriptions either of the numbers included in the two armies, or of their movements, but the above account may, I think, be relied upon. Besides the death of the king, the Scots had to mourn the loss of an archbishop, two bishops, two abbots, twelve earls, thirteen barons, and of a large number of gentlemen. 60,000 horses, and nineteen pieces of cannon, fell into the hands of the victors. Queen Catherine wisely spoke of the victory as more important to the future of England than any possible amount of achievement in Erance.

The duke was son to a brother of James III., but had been so long in France, that his property, language, and tastes were all French. This was in the spring of 1515. In the summer of the following year Henry prevailed on Francis to recall the duke, as a subject of the French crown, to residence in his proper country.* Before conforming in this matter to the wishes of Francis 1. the king of England, Francis had shown that his newsettu influence in the affairs of Europe was not likely to be \u00b0'\u2122t of a very pacific description. In the summer of 1515, an army was collected in France, which, it was given out, would march against the Swiss. But this army Francis conducted suddenly, and by an unexpected route, into the plains of Lombardy. He there defeated sept. .3. the imperialists, and took possession of Milan. Henry joined with the emperor Maximilian in opposing this aggressive policy on the part of France. But the exchequer of the emperor, though considerably re plenished by Henry, did not prove equal to the demand of his mercenaries ; and the only hope of success rested, it was said, on the possibility of in- oct. ducing England to assist with men as well as with money, f To secure this object, a startling overture was made Henry in to Henry by Maximilian. The latter declared that l'Ze 1 e Europe would not long submit to see Milan in the^^y hands of Germans or Frenchmen. Would the king of England assume the sovereignty of Lombardy? In isio. that case, the emperor professed himself willing to combine his forces with those of England, to march with Henry from Treves to Milan, to proceed from Milan to Rome, and there, in the presence of the * Pinkerton, Hist. ii. bk. xii. t Slate Papers, vi. 33-40.

Henry's advisers cautioned him against being dazzled by this strange proposal. Before much thought could be bestowed upon it, Francis succeeded, by skilful concessions, and by large pecuniary considerations, in bringing all the powers that might be expected to look with jealousy on his success, to acquiesce in it. So closed a seven years' war in Italy, leaving the relations of the belli gerents to each other, in the end, very much what they had been at the beginning. In support of this new settlement, Francis urged the necessity of peace and unity among the states of Christendom, that their common strength might be directed against the Turks, who were ravaging Hungary, and were menacing them all with a common ruin. This plea was reason able enough, only all parties must have seen that it might have been urged before France had made her recent acquisitions, with quite as much propriety as afterwards.* In all these proceedings the king of England was greatly influenced by one mind in his council- \u2014 the mind which, in a short time, had taken precedence of every other in the conducting of such affairs. In the town of Ipswich, in the year 1470, the wife of a butcher, well to do in his calling, gave birth to a son, who was found, as he grew towards manhood, to be possessed of capacity much above the common order, f At an early age the youth was sent to Oxford, where he became distinguished, not so much by the extent of his acqui- * Ellis's Letters, 1st Series, i. 134.

But that was the common belief in his lifetime, and on all men's lips ; and if it could have been shown to be in correct, it would not have been left to the men of a later time to deny it with such a total want of authority for so doing.

He obtained book vi a fellowship in Magdalen college, and became tutor Chap\" ' of the school connected with that foundation But he seems to have reached the thirtieth year of his age with his path in life undetermined. In his thirty-first year he must have taken orders, as he then becomes known as Thomas Wolsey, rector of Lymington, in Somersetshire, a living given him by the marquis of Dorset, whose son he had educated at the university. It was said, that the manners of Wolsey as a country rector, were so little clerical, as to have subjected him to a kind of punishment rarely inflicted except upon brawlers and vagabonds.* We know that afterwards he was for a short time one of archbishop Wareham's domestic chaplains ; that he filled the same office in the household of Sir John Nefans, treasurer of Calais ; and that, through the influence of that gentleman, he was advanced to be one of the king's chaplains. The king living at that time was Henry VII. In this position Wolsey endeavoured to acquire friends, and to make it evident that he had some capacity for business. Fox, the venerable bishop of Winchester, and Lovel, the chan cellor of the exchequer, became disposed to serve him. Through their recommendation he was entrusted with a mission of some importance from the king, to the emperor Maximilian who was then in Flanders. Henry was a cautious man in all his doings. He his mission was careful to see Wolsey before deputing him to this errand. The interview was satisfactory, and the new envoy received the requisite papers and instructions. That forenoon passed, and the next day. But on the following morning, as the king was on his way to prayers, he saw Wolsey. and was about to rebuke him for not being on his journey to the Netherlands, when, * The story is, that one Sir Amyas Pawlet, a magistrate, sent him to the stocks for being drunk and disorderly at a fair.

His promo tions. to his surprise, Wolsey dropped at his feet, and holding forth a packet, said that he had been and re turned, and begged his majesty to accept the answer. One material point in the message had been over looked, to the king's great regret ; but Wolsey had detected the omission, had ventured to supply it, and so the answers were in all respects satisfactory. The reward of this achievement was the deanery of Lin coln.* Henry VII. died in the following year. Wolsey was then thirty-eight years of age. Henry VIII. was nearly twenty years younger. Wolsey was well known to the young king. Within six months from his accession Henry gave him the forfeited residence of Empson \u2014 a noble mansion, which stood about where St. Bride's church now stands, in Fleet-street, having gardens and orchards reaching down to the Thames. By that time, also, the rising churchman had become almoner to his majesty, and a member of the council. The next year, another rec tory, and a prebendal stall in Windsor, were conferred upon him. In the year following, another stall and another deanery passed into his hands. In 1513, a third deanery, with the office of registrar of the Order of the Garter, fell to him. His next advancement, little more than twelve months later, was to the archi episcopal see of York. Subsequently, he retained more than one bishopric in his hands, wholly for per sonal reasons. His last ecclesiastical promotion was to the dignity of cardinal, with the authority of papal legate for all England. This princely rank raised him above all the nobility of the realm, civil and ecclesiastical. It should be remembered, too, that all these acquisitions were realized in little more than five years from the accession of the present king. During those years, moreover, no man was so much occupied in the diplomatic and civil affairs of the * The Life of Cardinal Wolsey, by George Cavendish ; edited by S. W.

On this point, all is in keeping with that adroit run to Flanders and back again, of which mention has been made. Henry VII. had designed prince Henry for the see of Canterbury, and the early studies of the prince received a tinge from that cir cumstance which never ceased to influence his tastes. Wolsey knew how to address himself to such tastes as no layman could. It was in his power also to make himself acceptable as an instrument of much value in matters of business ; either in assisting his sovereign when inclined to give his attention to affairs, or by enabling him to dispense with such occupation when so disposed. In the court spectacles and pastimes, with which the king was much occupied during the intervals of study or of business, Wolsey could make himself conveniently serviceable and agreeable. In his intercourse with the king he could be grave when gravity was in place ; or gay \u2014 gay as the gayest, when the royal humour ran that way. In the more artistic amusements of the court, whether private or public, no man catered for the royal gratification with the assiduity and success of Wolsey. t * Cavendish. Piddes. Turner's Hist. Eng. bk. i. c. 7. f Such in substance is the account given by Polydore Vergil. (Hist. 633.) But Wolsey had a quarrel with Polydore, had sent him to prison for six months on account of his alleged misconduct as a papal collector, and this sarcastic description, as it is called, has been attributed to Polydore's resentment. But Cavendish, one of Wolsey's household, undertook, in his Life of the cardinal, to refute the slanders which had been sent abroad by ' the madness of the rude commonalty,' concerning his old master. His account, however, as to the above particulars, is not more in Wolsey's savour than that given by Polydore (81-83). Nor is there any reason to think that Cavendish adopted this description from Polydore. Caven dish no doubt wrote from what he had witnessed, or had fair means of knowing. In fact, both writers describe what was generally credited,"], [50, "28 NATIONALISTS AND ROMANISTS. BOOK VI Chap. i. Aspires to the Papacy His case on the death of Leo X. So did this memorable person rise to his place in English history. In the greatness of the king of England, and in the greatness of England, Wolsey learnt to see his own greatness. His loyalty and his patriotism never ceased to be allied to the personal. Nor was it enough that he should have grown to such eminence, and should often seem to hold the balance between the great powers of Europe. He aspired, as is well known, to become the spiritual head of Chris tendom, and never ceased to aim at that object so long as there was the slightest ground to hope that it might be obtained. To describe the intrigues, the expenditure, and the double-dealing to which the car dinal resorted in furtherance of this scheme, would require a large space. Henry, from policy or per suasion, encouraged these high thoughts in his fa vourite minister, though much was done in relation to this object of which the king had no knowledge.* In the election of a pope it was necessary that two thirds of the cardinals assembled should agree in their suffrage. But the cardinals who were prepared to ohej the influence of Francis I. on the one hand, and the imperialists, as they were called, who were under stood to be pledged to the interest of Charles V. on the other, were so numerous when taken together, and must, we think, have been in the main true. We know enough of the manner in which Henry threw himself upon his favourites, and of the manner in which his favourites were obliged to become the slaves of his humour, to make this entire description highly probable. The first edition of Polydore's History was published on the Continent in 1534. Before that time, the pious and honest John Tyndale, who had a deep interest in knowing whatever might be known in regard to Wolsey, thus writes of him : ' He came unto the king and waited upon him, and was no man so obsequious and serviceable, and in all games and sports the first and next at hand ; and as a captain to courage others, and a gay finder oufof new pastimes to obtain favour with all. He spied out the nature and disposition of the king's playfellows, and all that were treat, and whom he spied meet for his purpose, he flattered, and made faithful with great promises.' \u2014 Practice of Prelates, 307, 308. * See Cavendish, Hall, Burnet, Herbert, passim.

His case on the death of Adrian. and so nearly equal when divided, that the choice of a successor to the chair of St. Peter was hardly possible, except as these two factions might be brought to some measure of compromise. The bitter rivalry between Francis and Charles, was faithfully reflected in their respective adherents in the conclave ; and Wolsey's success, unfortunately, was dependent on his being able to make friends from both sides. Hence much of the duplicity which marked his foreign policy, espe cially at particular intervals. Leo X. died in 152 1. But his health had been fail ing for some time, and Wolsey's hope of becoming his successor can be traced to 1519, if not to an earlier period. The French cardinals, and the imperialist cardinals, resolved to uphold their respective interests. During fourteen days they remained closeted together, facing each other in angry debate. Wolsey had his friends among the disputants, but he had no real chance of success. In the end, the choice fell, con trary to all expectation, on the ecclesiastic \u2014 a stranger to Rome and to its vices \u2014 who became known as Adrian IV.* The new pope had been tutor aud minister to Charles V. This election, accordingly, was a triumph of the imperialists, though, from its cir cumstances, and from the character of the man, the resentment of the defeated party was not of long con tinuance. Two jrears of ceaseless effort to improve a state 0!' affairs which had become too bad to admit of mend ing, brought the pious Adrian to his grave. The * John Clerk, sending his report of these proceedings to Wolsey from Rome, says, 'On my faith, were it not for the king's persuasions, I should stand greatly in doubt whether your grace would accept it [the papacy], if it were offered you. The thing is in such disorder, ruin, and decay, and shall be every day more and more, except God help and Christian princes set their hands. It should be too long to write unto your grace of the reported chiding, brawling, and scolding between these cardinals, and of their great schism, dissension, their malicious, unfaithful, and uncharitable demeanour one of them against the other, which every day increased while they were in conclave.'\u2014 Ellis, Orig. Let. 3rd Series, i. 304-316."], [52, "30 NATIONALISTS AND ROMANISTS. BOOK VI. Chap. i. history of the next election was even more scandalous than the last. Wolsey was now very earnest in his suit. He spared nothing in the way of correspondence, intrigue, or money. The old fight between the two factions was resumed. It is evident that Wolsey, throughout this business, had no real friend either in Francis or in Charles. The checks imposed on the ambition of those princes by England were formidable enough already, and promised to be much more so, if an Englishman, and a favourite of the king of Eng land, should ascend the papal throne. No aggressive policy would be possible to either, if opposed by Henry, and by an able pontiff in league with him. Of late, the papacy had become as much a military as an ecclesiastical power ; and in this renewed battle of the cardinals, accordingly, we see a conflict intended to determine, not merely who should be pope, but what power should be ascendant in the politics of Europe. The cardinals, in this instance, were occu pied through no less than fifty-nine days with their various debates and schemes. In the end, the impe rialists were again successful. The cardinal de Medici, who spoke of the French as his ' capital enemies,' be came pope as Clement VII.* Five years later, when Clement became unwell, Wolsey still looked with hope towards the triple crown, and was again in action. f But this whole affair was a mistake. For a con siderable interval Wolsey's bias in all matters of foreign policy was greatly influenced by his expecta tions of assistance when the papal throne should next become vacant. The vacancy came, he found himself deceived, and he then became intent on being avenged upon those who had deceived him. His quarrel with Charles came from this source. Rome was his Mos cow. His campaign in that direction brought evils upon him which were too great to be borne. He was crushed by them. * State Papers, vi. 175-184, 190, 195-201 t Burnet, i. App. 53."], [53, "31 HENRY VIII. AND W0ISEY. The revenue of the cardinal from all sources was book vi, such as almost to defy conjecture. His income from CnAF ' the offices which were combined in his person as a His p\"'\" \u2022 -l sions from churchman must have been without precedent m foreign English history. Added to this wealth, were the pnnce emoluments derived from his office as chancellor, and from his other civil functions. Beyond the princely means thus assured to him, were the large grists, and fixed annuities, which passed into his hands from the foreign princes whose affairs came under his influence. We do not know the extent to which he descended to fill his costers by such means, but we know more than enough on this point. So early as 1515 the duke of Milan pledged himself to pay the English minister 10,000 ducats a year. In 151 7 Charles V. bestowed on his ' dear and special friend' a pension of 3000 livres annually. Soon afterwards Charles promised his friend the bishopric of Badajos, together with 5000 ducats a year from a second bishopric in Castile, and 2000 from a third in Valentia. Francis I., not long after his accession, engaged to pay Wolsey no less a sum than 12,000/. annually. In 1522 Charles promised the cardinal a further pension of 9000 ducats in gold. Subsequently, an additional annuity of 2500 ducats was promised from the same quarter ; and when Clement VII. and the republic of Venice were in league against Charles, the gain of Wolsey from that source was to be a yearly pension amounting to 10,000 ducats. It has been said that the acceptance of such gratui- ties is not in itself evidence of official corruption. We marvel greatly that any honourable man should see these proceedings in any other light. In nearly all the connexions above mentioned the province of Wolsey was that of a magistrate. He was the admi- nistrator of international law. In nearly all the instances named, the moneys granted were granted to him in that capacity, and with a reference, avowed or understood, to services rendered in the past or expected in the future. The first grant made by"], [54, "32 NATIONALISTS AND ROMANISTS. BOOK VI, Chap. i. Foreign re lations of England resumed. the French king wTas made with a view to the sur render of Tournay, and Tournay was surrendered. In the subsequent proceedings of this nature, on the part of Francis on the one side and of Charles on the other, the objects in view were similar. It is true a pension of 9000 crowns in gold, promised by Charles in 1522, was promised expressly as an indemnity, inasmuch as Wolsey's services to Charles had caused the temporary loss of his Tournay pension from Francis. But the original grant had been a bribe, and the promise of the duke of Milan, and that of Clement and the Vene tians, were both manifestly open to that charge.* We have seen what the foreign relations of England were to the year 151 8. On the 12th of January, in the year following, Maximilian died. The choice of his successor, according to the laws of the empire, rested with seven electors, who could exercise their suffrage in favour of any candidate according to their pleasure. We have seen that Maximilian proposed to resign his crown in favour of Henry. f Charles and Francis now became competitors for that prize. Both affected to think that the vacant throne could hardly be an attraction to the king of England, and both applied to him for support. The correspondence on this subject was so conducted, that both kings were led to calculate on Henry's influence, while, in fact, he was not disposed to assist either, and at the eleventh hour he became a candidate himself. The result of this policy was such as might have been ex pected. The election fell upon Charles, and both Charles and Francis felt that there had been covert practice on the part of Henry and Wolsey. The car dinal legate was no doubt the chief delinquent. His * Rymer, xiii. 370, 525, 610, 710, 725, 769, 770; xiv. no. Fiddes, bk. ii. c. 12, 14. Turner, bk. i. c. 8. Ellis's Orig.

Charles looked with distrust on i5*>. this proceeding, and contrived to pay a visit to the Moy z5' English monarch a week before his intended interview with Francis. The visit of the emperor was con fiding and unostentatious. The French interview was marked, in its earlier stages at least, by suspicion, and was showy and gorgeous to the last degree. The French. people were then, as they have always been, the people in Europe the most fond of spectacle and gaiety ; and, of all nations, the English were the most in danger of taking the French as models. The meeting between Guisnes and Ardres lasted many days, and many thousand ladies and gentlemen were present to witness the jousts, and pastimes of all descriptions, which took place there, many of them being remark able alike for their extravagant fooling and their great cost.f This feeling on the part of Charles and Francis in Policy of relation to England, betrayed their deep distrust of \"Sn\"to each other. On both sides there was only too much \u00a3\u2122n\u00ab and reason for this want of confidence. The love borne by those princes to their subjects, weighed little against the feeling of jealousy with which they re garded each other, or against their common passion for territorial aggrandizement. To promote such objects, none of the arts or insincerities of diplomacy were spared on either side.

Sfew rup ture be tween Francis and Charles. ness of England to make herself felt in the affairs of those potentates, each of whom aspired to give law to Europe ; and Wolsey found a large field in which to gratify his love of pomp and power by meddling with all the departments of their policy. In the pacification of 151 8 it had been agreed between the three sovereigns, that if one of their number should renew hostilities against the other, the third should take part against the aggressor.* But, unhappily, by 1521, Charles and Francis had become intent on war. Pretences, as usual, were soon found. Complaints in some small and doubtful matters had been mutually urged, when Francis proceeded to de mand the surrender of the province of Navarre, or that an equivalent, said to have been promised in lieu of it, should be furnished, f The reader has seen the manner in which that province had been seized by Ferdinand, and will hardly be surprised to find the question concerning it assuming this shape. Charles was not disposed to comply with the demand thus made upon him. Whereupon, Francis sent the young king of Navarre, at the head of fourteen thousand men, to take possession of the disputed territory. Charles, it was alleged, had not only forfeited his word, but had at the same time assembled a large force in Franche Comte, with the manifest intention of invading France. The natural course of the Eng lish cabinet in this case was to mediate in favour of peace. Francis seemed strongly inclined to war. But circumstances arose to render his prospects of success less satisfactory. An attempt of his army to pene trate into Castile sufficed to allay some popular dis contents in Spain, and to rouse the patriotism of the people. The effect was, that Navarre was lost as speedily as it had been won. At the same time, it became known that Leo X. had allied himself with Charles, and had given the kingdom of Naples to that * Herbert, 43. t M. du Bellay, 101-104."], [57, "35 HENRY VIII.

But it was evidently to be an arbitration in name only, inasmuch as neither side would consent to be bound by any decision which did not cede its own rights according to its own estimate of them.* Wolsey, however, passed over to Calais, and ap- wolsey peared there in great pomp to act as arbitrator. While Caiais\u00b0as Francis assented to this much, from deference to nmpire\u2014in -\u00bb-|- -, . P -. . ... . sincerity of Henry, and to gratify his minister, it was not without the English reason that he suspected treachery on the part of both. J^ne It is now clear, from letters still existing in manu script, and not examined until recently, that Wolsey and Henry, while declaring themselves concerned to do justice to the king of France, were in secret communi cation with the emperor, and committed fully to his policy. f It was by Wolsey's suggestion that six * State Papers, i. 12-17, Y1- 70-82. t The following extract is from one of Wolsey's letters to Henry, before his departure for Calais : ' It may please your grace to understand I have received by the hands of the emperor's ambassador, letters from his master, written with his own hand, for my repair to your town of Calais ; which letters I send unto your grace herewith, by the tenour whereof the same may perceive how desirous the said emperor is of my speedy acce leration thitherward, and how greatly he is inclined to the straiier conjunction between you and him. Over this, by such communication as I have had by the French ambassador Delabaty, I do continually per ceive the French king to be glad and well-minded towards an abstinence of war for a season ; wherewith the emperor as yet will in no wise con descend. Nevertheless, I shall not fail by all politic means and persuasions continually to solicit the Emperor to be agreeable to the said abstinence till such time as it be seen what effect shall come of this diet at Calais, and the said straiter conjunction be concluded.' \u2014 State Papers, i. 20, 21. In a letter written by Pace to Wolsey, at Henry's dictation, the meaning of this ' straiter conjunction' is made clear. ' Please it your grace, the king hath concluded, according to your advice and counsel, to put in readiness five or six thousand archers, the same to be ready to do service as shall appertain, at such time as your grace shall have con cluded his affairs with the emperor, according to such communications, devices, and debatements, as hath been had betwixt you both on that behalf.

Grand re ception given to Wolsey by Charles. iSzi. Aug thousand English archers were to be put in readiness to act with the imperialists ; and we now know that the cardinal was prepared, in the manner of the mailed ecclesiastics of the Middle Age, to lead this force himself into the field.* Henry shared fully in the martial ardour of his minister, and allowed himself to be drawn into the duplicities which have marked the policy of Wolsey at this juncture. While the pre tended arbitration was in process at Calais, Charles was at Bruges. Wolsey insisted on its being necessary that he should see the emperor in person, and for this purpose he removed to the latter city. The emperor received the cardinal with all the ceremony that would have been due to his sovereign. After thirteen days of conference and amusement at Bruges, a secret treaty was matured, which was to give Navarre, Lombardy, and something more to Charles, and the crown of France to Henry. The real purpose of the proposed arbitration had been to gain time. Happily for his own affairs, while Calais furnished its talkers about peace, Francis had relaxed nothing in his preparation with diligence. His highness thinks that at such time as all things shall be concluded betwixt the emperor and him, according to his mind, and a resolution taken to invade France, then it shall be necessary for them both to provide for the destruction of the French king's navy ; and his grace would that, at time convenient, this matter might secretly be broken to the said emperor, and treated in such wise that this enterprise might suddenly be made against the French king. And the king taketh this for high and great enterprise, if it may thus by wisdom and good policy be brought to pass.' \u2014 Ibid. 23. Care was taken that Henry and Wolsey should be fully indemnified for all their losses in the shape of annual payments from Francis, as the consequence of going to war with him ; and the best forecast was exercised that these matters should be kept secret so long as not to endanger the last quarterly remittance that mio-ht be obtained from the French treasury ! \u2014 See much on this subject in State Papers, i. 23-58. Dr. Lingard makes no mention of this secret pre judgment of the case on the part of Henry and Wolsey, before the latter had set his foot in ' your town' of Calais, and leaves the reader to infer that the compact at Bruges was purely on account of the failure of negotiations at Calais.\u2014 Hist.

He had sent his generals into Cham- book vi. pagne, Picardy, Guienne, and Milan, and stood pre- f^jj pared himself to meet the emperor. During the same interval his enemies had been no less active.* At the close of the campaign of 1521 the French found themselves expelled from Milan. Elsewhere the balance of advantage and disadvantage was more equal. All that the policy of England would do to aid the imperialists, by obtruding new expostulations and new proposals upon their enemies, was done. Nothing could be more pitiable than the course into which England was dragged at this juncture by Wolsey and the king. But in the spring of 1522 the drift of the secret treaty at Bruges the year before was no longer a secret. Francis, on being told that Henry had decided to take part against him, replied with calmness and dignity, that he trusted he should be able to meet even that exigency, but that henceforth there was no living prince on whose word he should ever depend. f The result of the campaign of 1522 was on the Progresses whole so little satisfactory, that the parties chiefly Deilpoie concerned would probably have been disposed towards j^ Bour\" peace, had not some new elements of irritation come into play. When England declared herself hostile to France, Francis did not hesitate to become the patron of the exile De la Pole, a pretender to the English throne by his descent from the house of York. Of this person the English government had been so far jealous that spies were kept upon his track. On the * M. du Bellay, 113-118.

Failure of the great scheme of the allies. other hand, the duke of Bourbon, the most wealthy and influential subject of the French crown, had a r quarrel with Francis, and tendered his services to Charles and Henry, should they persist in their de- termination to humble the pride of that monarch. Bourbon pledged himself to sustain the pretensions of Henry to the crown of France. Great importance was attached to his defection, and by the month of August the parties were all agreed upon the diplo- matic and military arrangements which were to deliver Francis and the French into the hands of the invaders. The English were to be in France by the 25th of August, and the kingdom was to be entered by large forces, from different points, at the same time. Up to this period the French cabinet was so far in ignorance of these projects, that Francis was about to pass into Italy, in the hope of enlarging his territory in that quarter. But at the given time the chiefs opposed to him were all at their given places \u2014 except one. At the eleventh hour the mind of Bourbon had wavered. He did not quit his home until it became necessary he should do so as a fugitive and in dis- guise. He had then to avoid all the beaten paths of the country, armed men being everywhere in search of him. Weeks were thus consumed. Neither friend nor foe knew where to find the duke. So all the parts of the carefully-wrought scheme fell into disorder. The man from whom so much had been expected had thus marred everything. His own friends did not rise. The Germans kept in waiting for him now be- came mutinous for the want of pay. The English and the Flemings were left to act irregularly and fruitlessly. Bourbon, indeed, when he made his ap pearance, would still have accomplished something but, after his recent failure, men distrusted his judg ment and firmness, and were slow to commit them selves to his guidance.* * Mem.

By a series of skilful enter prises, he succeeded in compelling the French to re treat in great disorder from the soil of that country. Charles, Henry, and Wolsey now urged him to devise another scheme for the invasion of France. He did so : but in that responsible undertaking he had to depend mainly on assistance from England, and that assistance never came. The language of Wolsey in substance was : ' My master aspires to the crown of ' France ; make such progress in the invasion of that ' country as to assure him that you can place its ter ' ritory, or some considerable portion of it, at his dis ' posal, and you may then expect large assistance from ' him in men and money, but not till then.'* Pace, the English envoy, in pressing a bolder and a more confiding policy on the cardinal, went so far in one instance as to say, that if another course were not taken, he should impute to that minister the loss of the crown of France. Such words were new to the car dinal. He never forgave them.

With an English dynasty on the throne of France, it was urged, Europe might have rest, and the head of the church, and the church her self, might be secure and prosperous ; but by no other policy could those ends be accomplished.

He was not, therefore, to be seduced by such represen tations. He had other views concerning the best method of giving tranquillity to Europe and stability to the church. Could he have hoped for such results from the policy described, the difficulties in the way of prosecuting it were great. France soon made it manifest that her existence as a nation was a fact independent of the fate of her king. The invasion of that country, with any prospect of subduing it, would still be a very costly undertaking ; and Charles and Henry had both so taxed their subjects in support of their war projects, that their people had become weary, discontented, all but rebellious.* In the course of the summer of 1525 it became Rival evident that Spain was intent on making such arrange- Hen\u2122ean\u00b0d ments with France as should be best for herself, and Charles that England would be left to take the same course. The pope, in the meanwhile, was most urgent in his persuasions on the side of peace. Henry was by no means satisfied with this aspect of afl'airs. Charles was bound by treaty to a personal invasion of France, but he had failed of his promise. England had ex pended vast sums in support of the emperor's wars, and to this hour without the least advantage in return. On these grounds, and others, Henry decided to make peace with France ; and he did so without waiting to consult Charles on the subject. Added to all such grounds of discontent, in the case of Wolsey, was the wolsey's remembrance of the manner in which Charles had j\u00a3\u2122at,on failed him when he was a candidate for the papal Charles. chair. And Wolsey was not so cautious in the ex pression of his feeling as his sovereign. The whole confederacy that had been formed against France became distasteful to him. In his talk he learnt to * Hall, 695-697. Fiddes, 322 et seq."], [64, "42 NATIONALISTS AND ROMANISTS. BOOK VI. Chap. i.

Charles was apprised that the cardinal so spoke of him. In less than four months after the battle of Pavia we find the emperor stating to the English ambassador at Madrid, that his confidence in Wolsey for the future would be founded upon his deeds, not at all upon his words.* Two months later Henry is made to find reasons for concluding a treaty with France without waiting to obtain the concurrence of his nephew of Spain, though bound by treaty so to have clone ; and Wolsey then writes to the English ambassadors, in forming them of the altered feeling of Henry towards France, and in a letter to the pope he takes to himself the entire credit of the changes No sooner was Francis released than Wolsey began to exercise his ingenuities to the utmost to persuade * See the joint letter of the three ambassadors in Spain, bishop Tun stall, Sir Richard Wingfield, and Master Sampson, to Wolsey, in Ellis's Letters, 3rd Series, ii. 12 et seq.

Dr. Lingard speaks of the assertion first made by the imperialists, aud since taken for granted by historians, that the alliance between Henry and France and the divorce of queen Catherine were suggested by Wolsey, in revenge for his disappointment in regard to the papacy, as a mere assumption ; and the historian adds : * For eighteen months after that disappointment no traces of disaffection appear in his despatches, but the most eager desire to promote the common cause of the allies.' \u2014 vi. 106, 2nd ed.

Francis did not mean to be bound by the conditions which Charles had extorted from him, but he did not go readily into this scheme. He was, however, brought over to it.

Wolsey had found excuses * See these instructions in Strype, Eccles. Mem. i. 93-100, Oxford ed. State Papers, i. 158, 159. t Hall, 712-714. Charles proposed going to Rome to be crowned. ' Pope Clement VII., a man of great wit and vice, and of little virtue or learning, much doubted in himself what damage might come to him if the emperor had Naples, Sicily, and the duchy of Milan, and also were crowned emperor.

Even the freest pillage failed to save them from almost the last stage of famine. Nothing but the assurance that the spoil of some rich city was to follow as a compensation for such suffering kept them together. It was in the end decided that Rome itself should be the city assailed. The pope had been the prime mover in bringing on the war ; upon him and his, therefore, it was said, let the heaviest penalty descend. Clement flattered himself that the attack misht be Rome be- ... resisted, at least for a few days. In that case, famine sacked.'\"1 would do its work among the besiegers, and help might l5i7. be expected. The storming commenced early on the morning of Easter Sunday, amidst a thick fog, which prevented besiegers or besieged from seeing more than two yards before them. At the same time, the as sailants, being without artillery, had no means of entrance except by scaling the walls. Bourbon, who well knew the difficulty of the enterprise, to encourage his men, placed himself in front of the danger. Soon a shot from an arquebuss entered his body, and he fell to the ground a dying man. Even at such a moment his military self-possession did not fail him \u2014 ' Throw ' a cloak about me \u2014 let no man know it,' were the last orders from his lips. The siege was still prosecuted. Onset followed onset, and a thousand of the besiegers had perished, but Pome was not taken. Two hours had thus passed, when an aperture was discovered in the wall, which had once served as a window to an apartment within. It was all but concealed by the accumulation of soil near it. Excavation was com menced, and an entrance was secured. The besiegers rushed in. The astonished defenders of the walls, on finding the enemy in their rear, were seized with a panic. All was confusion. The pope, and many of the citizens, fled to the castle of St. Angelo. The whole city beyond the walls of that fortress fell into"], [68, "46 NATIONALISTS AND ROMANISTS. BOOK VI Chap. i. the hands of the enraged soldiery. The scene was one of boundless licence. Pillage, lust, and bloodshed were without restraint.* Pome, as the residence of the head of the Church, should have been the great peacemaker, and the great pattern of all Christian virtues. But during the last half-century, the Roman pontiffs, in their capacity as temporal princes, had been among the foremost in taking to the sword ; and Rome itself had been cha- racterized beyond any other city by its treacheries, its sensualities, and its crimes. It now reaped as it had sown. It was, indeed, a memorable sign of the times, when an army, acting under the name of the successor of Charlemagne, and bearing the title of the ' Most ' Catholic' king, brought such a flood of retribution and scorn on the seat of the papacy. Many of the soldiers under Bourbon were Lutherans, and this signal dese- cration of sacred things has been attributed mainly to the fanaticism of that portion of the spoliators. But the charge was not likely to be true ; and we know, from sources that cannot be suspected of partiality, that the Spanish Catholics were much less restrained in their excesses than the German Lutherans, f No * F.

Charles gave no sanction to the deeds of this banditti, but he profited largely by what they had done. t The testimony of Luigi Guicciardini is not that of a Protestant, and is explicit. Rome, as described by him, was ' a corrupt city, full of abomi nable vices, and with manners wholly unlike those of its famed antiquity :' \u2014 and of Bourbon's men he writes : ' I know that I am about to say what many will perhaps hardly believe ; it is that the Lutheran and Ger man nation, though commonly supposed to be more cruel, and more hostile to Italian blood than the Spanish, yet questa volta, in this affair, showed itself to be in its nature more benign, less covetous, and more tractable, than the Spanish or the Italian.

Scotland, doubt Romanism in Rome had done much to make some men Lutherans, but it had done much to make infidels of multitudes who still professed themselves Catholics. While the foreign relations of England were assum ing this complexion, what was the influence of these events on the relations between England and Scotland ? We have seen that in 15 15 the duke of Albany became a conspicuous person in the affairs of that country. In 1522, when another war had commenced between Francis and Henry, Albany had become regent, Mar garet's eldest son being in his minority. The duke leagued with France, and the Scottish borders were again menaced with war. Albany collected some eighty thousand men, and possessed more than forty pieces of brass cannon. The resources of England had of course been directed towards France. Money wherewith to oppose this second foe there was none ; and in the history of war, a scarcity of money means a scarcity of men. But lord Dacre, the warden of the West Marches, put on a bold front. He reminded the enemy of what had happened at Flodden field ; boasted of the multitudes that were flocking to his standard ; and so alarmed the duke, that he descended to solicit a truce for one month, that communication might be made to Henry. The result was, that the Scots were dispersed by the fear of an army which had never been assembled. These events belong to the autumn of 1522. In the spring of the following year, Albany, who had been absent from Scotland during the winter, landed with 5000 men. This force was to serve as the nucleus of an army for the invasion of England. The parlia ment favoured this project; and by the autumn the duke had mustered 60,000 men. The earl of Surrey, the hero of Flodden, had spread an utter desolation along the Scottish border, but looked with some dis may from the few armed men about him to the myriads opposed to him. He called on the cabinet to"], [70, "48 NATIONALISTS AND ROMANISTS. book vi. send all the young men who were idling about the CHAF- '\u2022 court to their duties in the field. He at the same time commended his family to the protection of those who should survive him, and was prepared for the worst, if the worst should come. Happily, the men of the northern counties came nobly to his aid. To his own amazement he soon found that he could march fifty thousand men against the enemy. He came upon the Scots while engaged in the siege of Wark castle, towards evening. Albany was not inclined to face such a foe. During the night the siege of that place was raised, and the Scots hastened homewards in much disorder. The English horsemen would gladly have followed the retreating foe, but the com mission of Surrey was to defend the English border, not to invade Scotland ; and that work was done. The men north of the Tweed had now placed their last trust in Albany. Margaret attempted to resume the government of the country. Henry encouraged her husband, the earl of Angus, to take upon him the office of regent, and during nearly twenty years from this time the two nations ceased from hostilities.* Attempts to We have seen that the soldiers engaged in the wars forSthTproy- 0I> Europe in the early part of the sixteenth century, secution of were to a large extent mercenaries, and that the in- fluence of England in relation to those contentions was mainly the influence of her exchequer.

The forced loans, under the name of ' benevolences,' to which Edward IV. had resorted, were condemned in a statute under Richard III. as illegal. But while the nation as such, was thus careful to protect the fruits of its industry, it did not extend the same protection to individuals, when exposed, on other grounds, to the displeasure of the government. The officers of Henry VII., and the king himself, committed many grievous oppressions against private persons. But so sensitive were the people at large on all money questions directly affecting them, that even the grants made bv parliament were more than once openly repudiated, and the feeling against the attempts made to raise money by way of loan was, as will be supposed, still stronger, especially among the more wealthy classes. Archbishop Morton, in dealing with the discontent of those classes, was insolent enough to say, that such of them as lived exjiensively gave sufficient evidence of lnwing money to spare, while those who lived more frugally might be reasonably suspected of hoarding. In either case, a moderate loan should not be taken as a hardship. This was spoken of at the time as ' Morton's fork,' which left the malcontent subject no way of escape. It was not, however, from such sources that the avari cious king acquired the larger portion of his wrealth \u2014 that came rather from fines and forfeitures, exacted under the colour of law. It should be added, that our money-loving and comfort- loving ancestors of those times, while so zealous to uphold the authority of parliament in relation to taxation, were not so sensible as they should have been to the importance of up holding the legislative power of that assembly. It is true, nothing became law without consent of parliament, but parliament did not adequately protect its own laws against straining and misinterpretation ; and the next evil to living under bad laws, is to be left to the mercy of bad interpreters of law.

One other good deed was done by that parlia ment. It passed a law which declared that no man should be adjudged a traitor for obeying a king who was such in fact, though it should afterwards be ruled that he was not such by right. The principle of this enactment promised to be of great value, and it was often appealed to in later periods of our history, though not always successfully. The great business of the first parliament under Henry VIII. consisted in the proceedings against the delinquents Empson and Dudley. Three years later Henry convened his second parliament. The purpose of its meeting was, that the two houses might concur in a declaration of war against France, and that the requisite supplies might be voted. The war was popular, and a subsidy and a poll-tax were granted. In 15 14, the third parliament in this reign was assembled. It had not been deemed expedient to enforce the poll-tax on the humbler classes. The king was in want of money. Some sumptuary laws, and others concerning trade, were passed. English wool was not to be exported, and English cloth was to be produced free from certain faults and deceptions which had much impeded the sale of that article. Tillage land was not to be turned into pasture ; and new regulations were imposed concerning wages. But the most significant fact in the history of this parliament wras, that as the session advanced, many of the members withdrew, and it was observed that those who remained, consisted very much of persons who combined together to oppose or carry particular mea sures, and who were described, on that account, as factious persons. The members who exposed them selves to this charge must have been men who felt their parliamentary influence to be of some value. The provision made against this alleged evil was, that any"], [73, "HENRY VIII. AND WOLSEY. 51 member leaving his duties without permission from book vi. the Speaker and the house, was to lose his wages.* Chap- ' It will be remembered that in the spring of 1522 woiseys Wolsey's pretended arbitration between Charles and al7moVey Francis had come to an end, and that Henry had iu ,5\" committed himself to a new war with France. The earl of Surrey was to conduct a powerful army into that kingdom. But the means were wanting. Henry VII., by avoiding wars, and by adding to his wealth from all available sources, had succeeded in rendering himself almost independent of parliaments. Henry VIII. and Wolsey were not much disposed to consult the humour of such assemblies. But in their case, there were habits of expense, both at home and abroad, which were not compatible with independence of the public purse. What Wolsey could do to suppress the constitution of his country in regard to taxation he did. In the present instance, the course taken by him was to convene the mayor and aldermen of London, and to inform them that a commission had been ap pointed for the whole kingdom, to levy a rate on all property above the value of 100/., for the prosecution of the war. ' The king,' said the cardinal, ' would ' have met you in person, had not urgent business ' elsewhere prevented. But his majesty confides in ' your readiness to show the affection of your ' loving ' hearts' towards him, by granting him a tenth on ' your lands and moveables ; and as to the ' spiritu ' altie,' ' said his grace, ' they ' shall and will ' pay a ' fourth part.' This the cardinal described as 'the ' least reasonable thing' the citizens could do. But the citizens did not so judge. They complained that only two months since they had lent the king 20,000/., and that in war time the poor merchant generally found money scarce and uncertain. Still more loud was their complaint when told that they should be put upon oath as to their means. ' The credit of the * Herbert, 23. Parl. Hist. i. 477-483.

At length, it was left to each man to send in his own return in writing, which was not to be made public. It was promised that the money so lent should be repaid from the first subsidy granted in parliament. But the lenders had little faith in the word of the borrowers, and great, we are told, was 'the mourning of the common people' on being thus burdened. The clergy claimed that the assessment in their case should be made by clerical commissioners \u2014 which was granted. On the basis of the returns thus obtained, Wolsey determined the extent of the military force that should be raised by the men of the maritime counties, on the plea of guarding the coast against invasion.* No trouble, however, in getting money sufficed to make Henry or Wolsey careful in spending it. The next year the want of money was the great difficulty. But the feeling called forth by the recent attempts to replenish the exchequer by loans had been such as to show that a continuance of that policy might become dangerous. In 1523, accordingly, Henry assembled his fifth parliament. Seven years had then inter vened since his fourth had been dissolved. The new parliament met in the Blackfriars. The summons which brought the two houses together stated that the object of their meeting would be to promote the in terest of the commonwealth by amending old laws and enacting new ones \u2014 not a word was said about money or the war. But when the commons assembled, Wolsey at once laid before them the grounds of the war with France ; and stated that not less than 800,000/. would be re quired to prosecute it successfully. His proposal was, that a property-tax to that amount should be imposed. When the house was left to itself, Sir Thomas More, who, through the influence of Wolsey had been chosen * Hall, 645, 646. Herbert, 50."], [75, "53 HENRY VIII. AND WOLSEY. Speaker, took up the case as presented by the cardinal, book vi. and urged that the sum named should be voted. (JtIAP' '\u2022 But the commons alleged that the coin of the king- Eftiisted br - . \u00b0 & the com dom was not sufficient to meet such a demand ; that mons\u2014 re-, an exaction so enormous was wholly without prece- p>en\u00b0to dent, and would be ruinous to the country. Some Wolse> '\u2022 days had been occupied with such protests, when Wolsey claimed to be admitted to the house with a message from the king. The majority were in doubt as to the fitness of allowing the cardinal to present him self before them for such a purpose, especially with such a train as usually attended him. More reminded them that his grace had lately charged them with a light use of their tongues in the business of that house, and urged that his eminence should be received, with ' his maces, his pillars, his pole-axes, his cross, his hat, ' and the great seal too,' if such should be his pleasure. Thus attended, the cardinal entered the house, said much against the king of France, much about the necessities of their sovereign, and much, too, about their own style of living, as showing that there was nothing in the king's demand that might not be readily complied with. The cardinal waited for some reply, but, to his amazement, the house was silent. He called on some members by name to answer. Still no voice was heard. At length, the Speaker, falling on his knees, excused the silence of the members, 'abashed,' Jtore-a as he said, ' at the sight of so noble a personage, who SteJLui ' was able to amaze the wisest and most learned men nal ' in the realm.

It is certain * Hall, 655-657."], [77, "55 HENRY VIII. AND WOLSEY. .s that all classes were resolved not to submit to a diminu- book vi, tion of their substance for such a purpose. The pro- C\"AF '\" posal was to raise a sum from the property of the realm at the rate of one fourth from the clergy and one sixth from the laity. But the clergy were resolute and unanimous in affirming that it did not become a king of England to ask for any man's goods except by order of law ; that this attempt to raise money by commission was not according to law ; and that the cardinal, and all persons upholding him in this course of proceeding, were enemies to the king and the com monwealth.* ' How all men took it,' says a chronicler of the time, ' was a great marvel. The poor cursed, ' the rich opposed, the light wits railed, and all heaped ' their imprecations on the cardinal and his adherents, ' declaring, that if men should give their goods by ' commission, then were it worse than the taxes of France, ' and so England should be bond and not FREE.'f Some of the commissioners finding it impossible to High-hand obtain so heavy a rate, ventured to write to the car- Wo^y!Lc \",JM1\" o\u00ab LKDO.MJ a lo,u<d, vciiiuicu. no VV.HUC uu i, 1 1 c >. cii - yVolsey\u2014 dinal inquiring if they might not accept half the b\"'\u2122ffl,l> required amount from some who were disposed to con tribute to that extent. Wolsey replied in high dis pleasure. He admonished the timid functionaries, as they valued their estates and their heads, to execute their commission to the full. The discontent, how ever, thus called forth, tended so much towards rebel lion, that Henry deemed it prudent to write to the city of London, and elsewhere, stating that he had been in ignorance of what was doing, and that he re quired no further contribution from his subjects than they were able and willing to make. Wolsey made this communication to the corporation of London ; but in so doing was pleased to assume, that the sixth which had been claimed from the citizens had been promised by them; that the contribution had thus become an honest debt ; and added, that, nevertheless, t Hall, C96. * Hall, 696."], [78, "56 NATIONALISTS AND ROMANISTS.

But the citizens had made no such promise ; the minister had made no such intercession in their favour ; and the mayor and aldermen, who knew what the history of the matter had been, retired ' sore grudging at the ' lying of the cardinal.'* Some of the city authorities now attempted to raise voluntary contributions in the different wards. But they had undertaken a thankless office. Nothing better than ' evil words' could be obtained. Wolsey, finding these agencies fail, censured the persons who had taken this service upon them, reminding them that it was not to them that his majesty had entrusted his commission, and stating that he should himself see the citizens one by one, and ask a benevolence of them in the king's name. One of the city council was bold enough to say that such a mode of proceeding would be a novelty, in many ways injurious, and contrary to law ; and added, that a statute in the first year of Richard III. had declared any attempt to raisj money by wTay of benevolence to be inconsistent with the known rights of Englishmen. Wolsey answered, ' Sir, ' I marvel that you speak of Richard III., who was an ' usurper, and a murderer of his own nephews. Of so ' evil a man, how could the acts be good ?

But the councilman rejoined, that the act mentioned was not to be taken as the act of the king merely, but as that ' of the whole realm, which is the parliament.' Coaxing now followed scolding.

It required all the address of the duke of Suffolk, and of the lord treasurer, the duke of Norfolk, to restrain these tendencies to disorder. At length Henry convened his council, and wished Henry dis to know how a course of proceeding so wanting in pXVof consideration had originated. Wolsey pleaded that ae^arfii what he had done had been done with the concurrence nal'\u00ab <\u00bbe of his colleagues in the government, and from a loyal wish to supply the manifest necessities of his majesty's exchequer. For himself, he was willing to bear any measure of blame which his zeal in the king's service might have brought upon him ; and with regard to the principle of what had been done, the king of Eng land had been merely encouraged to do as the king of Egypt had done long since by the advice of Joseph ! But the king is said to have been ' sore moved that ' his subjects should have been thus stirred.' Letters were now sent to all the commissioners requiring them to abstain from their office ; and in those docu ments an attempt was made to take the blame of all this trouble from the shoulders of the cardinal. But not the slightest credit was attached to such repre sentations. The last act in this drama was an attempt on the part of the cardinal to bring the citizens to confess publicly, that they were ' the king's, body and goods, ' at his will and pleasure.' This confession he would have had them make, that all Frenchmen might thereby see their devotion to the will of their sovereign. In other words, such were Wolsey's profound ideas of political science, that he held a king to be great in the measure in which his subjects were submissive, and if Englishmen would only consent to express themselves as abjectly as Frenchmen, then it would be seen that the king of England was as great a king"], [80, "58 NATIONALISTS AND ROMANISTS. book vi. as the kmcn 0f France.

The proceeding against him appears to have been felt at the time as harsh and cruel.

C\"AP' '\" Henry was mindful of the letter of his promise ; but in his will, instructed his successor to see that the sentence against the earl was carried into effect ; and Henry VIII. , some years after his accession, and apparently without any new ground for such a pro ceeding, sent the imprisoned nobleman to the block.* The case of Sir William Stanley, who was beheaded la under Henry VII., furnishes another instance of the manner in which the crown in those days often thrust its resentments into the place of the law in the case of state offenders. The conduct of Stanley, moreover, is illustrative of the unsettled loyalty, so observable in the upper ranks in England during the fifteenth cen tury. Stanley had saved the life of Henry at Bos worth ; and, as the man who decided the fortunes of that day, he had placed the crown of England on the brow of the new king on the field of battle. As in the case of the Percys, of the great Warwick, and of the duke of Buckingham, in past reigns, this eminence of service in a subject was not found compatible with the reverence due to a sovereign. The remembrance of such deeds generated large expectation \u2014 such ex pectation as could hardly fail to end in discontent and treason. Stanley had been imprudent enough to awaken suspicion of his fidelity by talking lightly about the lawfulness of unsheathing the sword in support of an undoubted descendant of the house of York. Henry, though there was some limit to his bounty, had heaped wealth and honour on Stanley, and the ingratitude which his secret disaffection betrayed was interpreted by a natural feeling of resentment, and cost him his life. It is not certain that he had done or devised anything realhy treasonable. f The only proceeding of this nature, during the r>uke os J r o ' o Bucking- ham. * Hallam, i. 35, 36. f Hall, 468-470.

The father of this duke, it will be remembered, perished by order of Richard III. The son appears to have inherited the restlessness and dis content of the parent. The present duke was too vain of his rank, and too aspiring, to take his place submis sively in the train of Wolsey. The quarrel between these persons became bitter, and the cardinal well knew how to bring the king over to the side of his vindictive policy. Unfortunately, Buckingham, though a man of eloquent speech and popular manners, was no match for such an antagonist. He was not merely ambitious, he was weak and passionate in pursuit of his objects. An obscure monk near his residence affected to have revelations from heaven, and secretly predicted the elevation of the duke to the English throne. Credulity in this form was a feature of the age. In the mind of Buckingham such predictions found a soil only too ready to receive them. He does not appear to have meditated anything hostile to the personal rights of the king ; but he appears to have indulged the illusion, that should Henry die without issue, he might possibly himself become the next sove reign. He disclosed his thoughts on this subject in con versations with two of his confidential servants, and to one or two friends beside ; and he was accused of court ing popularity, wTith the intention of using it to treason able purposes, should the imagined crisis arrive. But this seems to have been the extent of his folly. Had Henry died without offspring, Buckingham might have pleaded a certain pedigree of which he boasted, and might have attempted to enforce his claim by the sword. The king, however, had not so died, and nothing of that nature had been done.* But after the fate of the poor earl of Warwick, it must have been * MS.

In the case of Buckingham, Wolsey appears to have been a chief actor ; for the people it is said, lamented the fate of the duke, and ' libelled the ' cardinal for it, calling him Carnificis fdium, the son ' of a butcher.'* In 1525, the cardinal had matured his plans for wolsey's founding two colleges, one in Oxford, the other in suppression Ipswich. Through his influence with the kins:, a great f some i i\u00bbT* \u25a0 i t r\\ r t r lesser mo number of livings were assigned to the Oxford founda- nasteries tion. To such an appropriation of church property little exception was likely to be taken. But it was otherwise when Wolsey obtained powers, both from the king and from the pope, to suppress some of the lesser monasteries, and to transfer their revenues to his new establishment. It was alleged, and not perhaps untruly, that the monasteries selected were of a class which had greatly deteriorated ; that they did not carry out the will of then* founders ; and that they had, in fact, become worse than useless ; while the new appropriation of their funds, it was urged, could hardly be called an alienation, inasmuch as the design of the proposed colleges was to further the interests of sacred learning. But plausible as this reasoning may have been, it did not suffice to prevent loud complaint. The sufferers, thrown for the most part homeless upon society, went everywhere denouncing these proceed ings as sacrilege. The enemies of the cardinal were generally disposed to take up the same language : and many dispassionate men looked with alarm on what * Hall, 623 et seq. Stow, 510 et seq.

' So the cardinal ' endowed his college, which he began so sumptuously, ' and the scholars were so proud, that every person ' judged the end would not be good.'* It required, however, a much graver error than this innovation in support of his colleges to bring Wolsey to his fall. w ar with The covert adhesion of Henry and Wolsey to the kague~with Italian league of May, 1526, was perpetuated, with as Francis and much concealment as possible, to the close of 1527. Not until January, 1528, did Henry declare wTar against the emperor. This war was not popular. The people of England regarded the subjects of the emperor as their natural allies, their foreign traffic being almost wholly with them, especially by means of the great marts of the Netherlands. Fifteen thousand Flemings were said to be resident in London for the purposes of trade. France, at the same time, was regarded with an hereditary jealousy. The old Cressy and Agincourt feeling, though much abated, had not passed away. But the king and his minister had valid reasons for being dissatisfied with the conduct of Charles, and for joining wdth Clement in his attempt to redress the balance of power between France and Spain, which the battle of Pavia had done so much to disturb. Above all, by committing himself thus to the side of Clement and his Italian league, Henry was willing to believe that he could hardly fail of securing the services of his holiness in a matter which now began to occupy much of his thoughts \u2014 viz., his divorce from queen Catherine. Wolsey was strongly in favour of this anti-Spanish * Hall, 694. Fiddes, bk. i. c. 25 ; iii. 1-3. Strype, Eccles. Mem. i. App. Nos. 28, 29."], [85, "63 HENRY VIII. AND WOLSEY. policy. He ventured his all upon it. He braved the book vi. popular disaffection in defending it. From this time CHAr '' nothing but success, where success was to the last de gree improbable, could possibly secure to him a con tinuance of power. To no question in English history has the heat of origin of party feeling contributed a larger measure of contra- control\u2122 diction than to this question concerning the divorce of versy' Henry VIII. from Catherine of Aragon. The Ro manist version is very simple, and may be stated in few words. Henry's guilty passion for Anne Boleyn was not to be gratified except on condition of making her his wife.. So strong did this passion become, that, in the end, no opposition to it was to be tolerated. To this feeling, and this feeling alone, we owe the project of a divorce, Henry's second marriage, and the great ecclesiastical changes which followed. But this is a one-sided representation, and by no means satisfactory. There were sagacious Catholics in those days who could not accept such statements as reason able \u2014 who, in fact, looked upon them as absurd. Two papal legates, who had examined the case in England, on writing to the pope, describe it as nothing less than madness to imagine that the king of England should do as he was doing merely on the ground of preferring one woman to another. The manners of the queen, they admit, may have been rigid and gloomy ;* but no man, they affirm, could believe the king ' to be of so ' weak a disposition as to allow himself to be led by ' mere sensual attraction to dissolve a relationship in ' which the flower of his age had been passed without ' a blemish [persancte], and in which he had borne ' himself, through the present change, so reverendly ' and honourably.'!- There are three points included in this case which Three mate deserve the attention of the reader : First, the suspicion, \u00ab*a\u00abn,g to this con- trovtr.-/. * ' Duris moribus aufc injocunda consuetudine.' f Burnet, i.

CnAP. i. as diffused at this time touching the validity of the marriage between Henry and Catherine, did not origi nate with the king ; secondly, the man who, according to the best evidence, had been the first to suggest the doubt which now began to be felt on this subject, was Wolsey ; and, thirdly, the notion of a second marriage had been entertained, and proceedings had taken place in relation to it, before the name of Anne Boleyn is mentioned. Some eighteen months before that time, while Anne was in Paris, and unknown in the English court, Henry, according to contemporary writers, was contemplating a divorce, and began to look towards Margaret, the accomplished duchess of Alencon, sister of Francis I., as his future queen In this stage of the affair nothing was said about the marriage between Henry and Catherine as having been from the begin ning unlawful. Other grounds were alleged.* But Margaret was one of those ladies who adorned the times of the Reformation by their ardent love of letters, and by their deep religious principle. According to the language attributed to her, she could not consent to ascend the throne of England at the cost of break ing the heart of the woman who would be displaced by her so doing. Margaret soon afterwards married the king of Navarre. f In the spring of 1527 negotiations were in process for a marriage of the princess Mary, either with Francis or with his son, the duke of Orleans. In the course of the deliberations on that subject, the bishop of Tarbes, on the part of France, suggested that probably, * Hall, writing in June, 1527, speaks of the rumour as common, that the king should marry the duchess of Alencon, sister to the French king, and states that the viscount Rochfort had procured a picture of the said lady. But he is in error in supposing that the alleged unlawfulness of the king's marriage had been urged in support of that project. What had taken place in respect to the duchess belongs to the preceding year, and happened before that point was mooted. \u2014 Chron. 728. f Le Grand, Hist. liv. i. 46.

Was it lawful for a man to marry his brother's widow ? This, it is alleged, was the first mention of distrust on this ground, and the bishop is supposed to have spoken to this effect under the prompting of Wolsey. It is certain that Henry always declared that the scruples now felt on this point had not originated with himself, but had been called into existence by the opinions of learned men. Wolsey also affirmed, on all expedient occasions, that he had himself been the first to raise difficulty in this form, and to urge that there should be a second marriage. Within two months from the time of the delibera tions above mentioned, the cardinal made his well known visit to France, and the common talk was, that the purpose of his embassy was not limited to the con templated treaty between the two countries, but was intended to secure a new wife for the king. Wolsey made communications with this view to the princess Eenee, the daughter of the late king, Louis XII. ISTo great progress would seem to have been made in this delicate business. In the meanwhile, Henry appears to have felt that it did not comport with the respect which a king of England owed to himself to hazard overtures of this nature with the probability of failure ; and the attractions of Anne Boleyn may be supposed to have helped his majesty towards this conclusion. There could, indeed, have been little hope of success opinions of in ' the king's matter,' as the divorce question came concerning to be called, if the ground of that case had consisted tbe a \"\"\"'\u25a0 solely in Henry's preference of Anne Boleyn to Catherine, or had there been room to suspect that a seeling of that nature was the main reason for what was to be done. We have seen that the marriage of Henry with Catherine was regarded from the first as of doubtful expediency and legality, and that Henry had renounced the contract, under his father's direc- tion, when he became of age. The pope, indeed, had II F"], [88, "66 NATIONALISTS AND ROMANISTS. BOOK VI. Chap. i. Henry's supposed motives in seeking a divorce. granted a dispensation. But the prohibition of such marriages was said to rest on the authority of scripture, and was it to be supposed that even the power of the pope could be extended to a rescinding of what had been thus determined ? This was the question which the case had raised. We have seen that rarely have two persons come together whose qualities in common were so few, and so little likely to ensure happiness in married life. As years passed away the health of the queen decHned. Her seasons of pregnancy ended prematurely, or her children died soon after they were born. When these experiences had told upon her constitution in a way to be especially felt by her husband, and there was no hope of her being again a mother, Mary, a sickly child, was the only surviving offspring from this union. The temper and manners of Catherine, naturally cold and ungenial, became much more so under these cir cumstances. But during nearly twenty years the fidelity of Henry to his obhgations as a husband was such as few kings have evinced. He had a natural son, wrho died early, but lived long enough to be created duke of Richmond, and to rise to official rank. We have no proof of a second connexion of that nature in his history. To write about the ' amours' and 'mistresses' of Henry VIII., as though he had been a man wont to form con nexions of that nature, is to insinuate the injurious, in the absence of- proof.* Henry, as we shall see, has faults enough to bear; the case against him is only weakened by being mixed up with exaggeration and falsehood. From natural causes Catherine had ceased to be his wife. He was a man so far conscientious in such matters, that he did not feel at liberty to indulge * Lingard, vi. 151. It has been said that Mary Boleyn had been a mistress to the king before he avowed his passion for her younger sister. But the assertion does not rest on any good authority. We have no doubt of its untruth. See the question discussed by Mr. Fronde, iv. App."], [89, "HENRY VIII. AND WOLSEY. 67 BOOK VI. Chap. i. in miscellaneous amours. From these causes it was natural that the thought of another matrimonial connexion should be agreeable to him, and a feeling of this nature had probably greater influence upon him than he would have been willing to confess even to himself.* When, moreover, we have to deal with reli gious scruples, it behoves us to guard against judging of the times of Henry VIII. by our own. The theo logical indifference and scepticism so familiar to us had small place in the feeling of Englishmen at that time. Henry believed as the sound Catholics of his day be lieved, and what he avowed as religious conviction was, we have reason to think, substantially a real conviction. His scruples may have been exaggerated in favour of his inclinations, but we can suppose them to have been in a measure sincere scruples. We can believe, also, that he saw, or thought he saw, the frown of Heaven on his union with Catherine, in the sad fate that had come upon the issue of that marriage. And if it is possible to conceive of Henry's avowed distrust concerning the religious aspect of his marriage as not wholly insincere, it is quite easy to understand how he should have felt a real anxiety in regard to the succession, should he die leaving the princess Mary as his only child. Henry knew that throughout his reign the question concerning his successor had never ceased to be agi tated. Buckingham lost his head as the price of his imprudent talk on that subject. Suffolk and Norfolk knew better how to govern their utterances, but their thoughts went in the direction of the throne hardly less freely than those of Buckingham.! AVhen doubts * Herbert, 100.

BOOK VI, Chap. i. came to be entertained concerning the validity of Catherine's marriage, the claims of the princess Mary were no longer beyond challenge. The accession, moreover, of a female sovereign, would have been a novelty in English history which might well be re garded with some misgiving under any circumstances, and especially in such circumstances. Supposing the claims of Mary to be set aside, or disputed, the next lineal descendant must have come from Scotland, through Margaret, and a Scottish claimant might always calculate on assistance from France, and would be sure to be opposed in England. Underneath all these elements of unsettledness were the embers of the old York and Lancaster antagonism. Henry VII. was so far from looking on that feud as certainly at an end, that he inflicted a judicial murder on the young earl of Warwick in the hope of guard ing against mischief from that source. But the best blood of the Yorkists was still in the veins of the high - minded countess of Salisbury, and beat as passionately as ever in Reginald de la Pole. Happily for us, the law of succession to the throne is now so defined, and fenced about, as to leave small room for difference of opinion on that subject. But it had not been thus in any period of English history before the reign of Henry VIII., and the recent wars of the Roses had brought all grounds of claim \u2014 the hereditary claim, the parliamentary claim, and the claim of the strongest \u2014 alike into dispute. It may be that no portion of this plea, nor the whole of it together, should have been deemed sufficient to warrant a king in discarding one wife and taking another.

We have no doubt that all these motives had their influence upon him, though the least generous were probably the most powerful. Wolsey wrote to Clement while in France, and subsequently from England, deploring the humilia tions which had been imposed on his holiness and on the cardinals by men acting in the name of the emperor. The king my master, he writes, has been brought by my instrumentality to be one with you in heart and soul in your troubles, and no sacrifice will be deemed too great by us that may be of service to you in this exigency. But, in adopting this course, pledging our selves at all hazards to befriend and aid you, we have confided in your readiness to exercise the high spiritual power vested in you according to the wishes of the king, and so as to save the English nation from the perils which he at present in its path.* On his return to England, however, Wolsey found, Henry de to his great dismay, that Henry had determined to marrylnne marry Anne Boleyn. He at once saw that such a Bol<iyn step would call forth jealousy among the great families ; that his efforts to bind England and France together by raising a French princess to the English throne, would be frustrated ; and that in the new queen and her family he should probably find a rival power too great to be under his control. On his knees the car dinal entreated his master to abandon a scheme so fraught with danger.

So early as the month of June, Catherine had come to know something of the king's scruples, and of his intention to obtain the opinions of divines.* In August, the emperor had been made aware of these circumstances, and was informed that Henry had de cided on seeking a divorce. Attempts were made to pacify both these parties, by assuring them that nothing wras intended beyond a satisfactory settlement of the question. Inasmuch as the doubt had been raised, it was indispensable that it should be examined and set at rest.f During the summer of this year the language of Henry on this exciting topic was com paratively calm, and seemed to be honest. He more than once said, the dispensation in favour of my mar riage was valid or it was not ; if valid, it shall not be mine to depart from it. j But, as the autumn ad vanced, the influence of Anne Boleyn became ascendant, and a change of feeling was perceptible. Henry knew that great effort would be made by Charles and Catherine to secure the friendly offices of Clement ; and, in his turn, he spared no effort to counteract their influence in that quarter. Early in September, Dr. Knight was sent to Italy on this busi ness. \u00a7 But the pope was then a prisoner in the hands of the imperialists, and so remained until the month of December. On the third day of that month * State Papers, i. 194-196.

But the envoys from England now had free access to him. They found him willing to concede almost anything, if the French would only so far advance as to give him a fair prospect of safety from the resentment of the emperor. Wolsey now matured his plans in favour of the king's matter. f He alleged that the law of revelation and the law of nature were alike against marriage with the wife of a deceased brother, and that the dispensa tion obtained from Julius II. had been obtained on the ground of false representations.} The cardinal prepared four documents which the pope was required Four docu to sign. The first declared the existing marriage by void, if that with Arthur had been consummated ; the the pope second commissioned Wolsey to examine and decide concerning that fact in England ; the third granted Henry a dispensation to marry again ; the fourth bound his holiness against annulling any one of the above instruments under any circumstances. \u00a7 Before these documents were submitted to Clement at Orvieto, the pontiff had bound himself to Charles in Rome not to do anything in relation to the contemplated divorce without his knowledge. Nevertheless, his holiness was now induced to sign all these instruments ; but with the understanding that his having so done should be a secret until the check given to the impe rialists by the allies should be such as to allow7 of his acknowledging the act without danger. || Wolsey was delighted with this measure of success. * Herbert, 87.

Much has been said about the ' conscience' and the ' constancy' of the pontiff during this memorable dis cussion.* But, in truth, the conscientiousness of Clement, from first to last, was near akin to his con stancy, and the latter always left him at liberty to take sides with the party whose fortunes at the moment happened to afford him the best prospect of security against political inconvenience. His feeling was in favour of the English cabinet. If he could only have persuaded himself that the course to which he was inclined might be taken with impunity, not withstanding the menace of the imperialists, the issue would have been speedily reached. He often said, that so far as his own judgment was concerned, he could be content to accept the declared conviction of Henry and Wolsey as his final authority. But the language of Clement in the history of this business was always that of a dual man. His natural man was on the side of the divorce, as being on many grounds desirable, especially as promising to save England from those civil contentions in the sixteenth century which had so exhausted its strength and resources in * Lingard, vi. 196."], [95, "HENRY VIII. AND WOLSEY. 73 the century preceding.* But his official man was always book vi. entangled amidst a mesh of difficulties by the ca- \u00b0HAP' '\" suistry of the imperialists in the consistory, and by their power in the field. The appointment of the proposed commission to hear the case in England could hardly be refused. The powers with which the two legates constituting that commission should be entrusted were the great difficulty. The claim of the English ambassadors had been, that the authority of the commissioners should be final. But the pope's advisers were not in favour of that course. After much discussion, it was pro posed that the pope should sign a ' decretal,' which should bind him not to revoke the commission, and to confirm its judgment should that be in favour of the divorce \u2014 the document so pledging his holiness, to be for a convenient season a secret document between Henry and the pontiff. On no ground was this memorable instrument to be made public, unless the pope should himself violate the pledge there given. The document was duly signed, but it was never allowed to pass out of the hands of the papal agents. It will be obvious that the effect of this piece of The pnpai history on the future influence of the papacy was disclosed in likely to be anything but favourable. It is certain \"JXgT that the real function of the pontiff, and the true 8,roneg<J|lJ,];e nature of the system supposed to be represented in his English eu person, were from this time a somewhat perplexing voy9- * The ambassadors urged ' what danger it was to the realm to have this matter hang in suspense.

The language of the ambassadors became such, at times, as they had never dreamed of using. In addressing his holiness, they argued that the pope could settle this question or he could not. If he could not, what became of the spiritual function with which he was supposed to be exclusively invested ; and if he could do what was required from him, but dared not do it because awed by secular power, who could reverence an authority which might at any time be thus checked and mis directed ? When pressed with reasoning of this na ture the pontiff exhibited a sad picture of bewilderment and helplessness. He said and unsaid : he sighed, wept, sobbed, rose from his seat and paced the room, throwing his hands abroad, so that the envoys were constrained to desist from their appeals, and to stand looking in silent amazement on the spectacle before them. At length, the proposed commission was agreed to, and the cardinal Campeggio was deputed to act with Wolsey, and the pope now signed the promised secret ' decretal.' But care was taken, as we have intimated, that it should not pass into improper hands. It was committed to the safe keeping of Campeggio. It was not to be entrusted to the hands of Henry or of Wolsey. It might be read to them, but they were to have no further knowledge of it. Campeggio was a diplo matist of the true Italian stamp \u2014 reserved, subtle, and intolerant, and his leanings hitherto had been those of an imperialist. When he accepted this commission the great anxiety of Clement was to gain time. Italy was still a battle-field between the imperialists and the French. Clement was watching the struggle with deep interest, to see on which side the scale was likely to turn. Delay seemed to give him his only hope. Campeggio, accordingly, was not to hasten his journey.

Her answer betrayed the feeling by which she was influenced. She would consent to the proposed separation, and would take the vow of chastity, if the king would place himself under a similar obligation. The meaning of this retort was obvious. Henry de scended so far as to inquire whether the pontiff might be expected to release him from such a vow should he consent for a season to be bound by it ! This controversy had not advanced thus far without becoming the occasion of much scandal among the people. We have seen how this war wTith Spain came to be so unpopular; and the meditated divorce of queen Catherine was regarded by many as a part of the same mischievous scheme of policy. Wolsey fell especially under the public censure, and Henry himself did not escape. Henry was vain of the loyalty of his sub jects. He was not a little disturbed when the sharp speeches now made concerning him reached his ears. ' The common people,' it is said, ' especially women, ' and others who favoured the queen, talked largely, ' and said that the king would for his own pleasure ' have another wife.'* Henry, in the hope of re moving this impression, assembled a large body of the nobility and others at his palace of Bridewell, and there stated his case in his own words. In a recent conference, said the king, concerning the marriage of the princess Mary, the bishop of Tarbes expressed some doubt whether the birth of that lady could be accounted as legitimate, the marriage between myself and Catherine being the marriage of a man with his brother's wife, which is said to be contrary to the divine law. Since that time many learned divines have been consulted, and their opinions for much the greater part have been found to be against the va lidity of any such marriage. These opinions, said Henry, have disquieted my conscience, and this conscientious difficulty, and my great anxiety about * Hall, 574."], [99, "77 HENRY VIII. AND WOLSEY. the succession, and not any want of esteem or affec- book vi. tion for the queen, have constrained me to entertain Cha>' ' the thought of a divorce, and of another marriage. Such was the substance of the king's statement. Many, it is said, sympathized with him. Many trembled to think of the probable issue of such a question, now that it had been thus publicly broached. All were thoughtful.* This meeting between the king and his subjects, Catherine o o t o 3 and the was soon followed by a meeting, in the same place legates. between Catherine and the legates, Campeggio and Wolsey. The legates informed the queen that the mission entrusted to them was to examine the grounds on which the marriage between herself and the king had been questioned. Catherine paused for awhile, and then, in the presence of her ladies said in answer : ' Alas ! my lords, is it now a question whether I ' be the king's wife or no \u2014 when I have been mar- '5^8. . _ - . \u00b0 ....

For ' you only has he to thank for all his wars and ' vexations ; and as for me, his poor aunt and kins ' woman, what trouble you have put me to by this ' new-found doubt God knoweth, to whom I commit ' my cause according to the truth.'* Wolsey does not seem to have been prepared for this outburst of lofty, feeling. Judging from the accounts which have reached us, his defence must have been tame compared with the force of the assault made upon him. He appears, however, to have .de nied most explicitly having done anything towards originating any measure or discussion on this matter \u2014 a declaration strictly the contrary of assertions made by himself on many other occasions. Campeggio reached England in October, 1528. The meeting in the palace of Bridewell, above mentioned, was a month later, and six months intervened from that time before the formal opening of the process by the legates. The great hall of the Blackfriars, in London, was the place of meeting. The sort of court there instituted was marked by great pomp and solemnity. Catherine disowned its authority. But Henry left his case in the hands of the legates, and * Hall, 155."], [101, "79 HENRY VIII. AND WOLSEY. the business took its course. Witnesses were exa- book vi. mined. Opinions were received. More than a month C\"AP' '\u2022 was thus occupied. But Campeggio declined to pro-The.Pr\u00b0 nounce upon the case. He privately entreated the come \u00bb pope to recal him. In the end, he pleaded thatnotl\"ns' the season of the year had arrived in which all un finished suits, according to the Roman usage, were postponed to the next term, which would not com mence until October. Several noblemen urged, in strong, and even menacing terms, that there should be an end to these delays, and that the case should be brought at once to a conclusion. But Campeggio was fertile in expedients. He insisted that the evi dence was incomplete. New difficulties had arisen. Delay was unavoidable. In the meantime the pope must be consulted. Finding the proposed adjourn ment inevitable, the duke of Suffolk struck his clenched hand upon the table, and exclaimed with much warmth, ' Now I see the old saw is true, that no cardinal ever ' brought good to England,' \u2014 ' and with that saying,' says our authority, ' all the temporal lords departed rrotest hy ' to the king, leaving the legates sitting, one looking sussoik.1\" ' ' at the other, sorely astonished because they saw the ' temporal lords depart in anger.'* In the words 1529. which accompanied the blow upon that table were the Jullc' seeds of the change now at hand.f Clement now repented of the promise he had made The cause in the decretal bull ; revoked the commission he had Rome. given to the two cardinals ; and, resuming the entire cause into his own hands, he declared that if the king 1519. of England persisted in his suit, it would be necessary Jul> lS' that he should prosecute it in person in the papal court. Even Wolsey denounced this mixture of hol lowness and insolence in most indignant terms, j * Hall, 757, 758. f Cavendish makes Wolsey retort sharply on Suffolk for his saying about the cardinals j but Hall is a better authority, and from his lan guage we must conclude that no reply was made.

What had led to this greatly altered policy on the part of the pontiff? The successes of the impe rialists had prepared the way for the treaty of Bar celona, in which the pope had bound himself, some three weeks before, to be the docile ally of the emperor. Further \u2014 Catherine now asserted more strongly than ever, that Henry in his marriage could not have violated any law, inasmuch as though she was at that time a widow, she had never been a wife. This point she urged anew on the consideration of the pope. Evidence opposed to this assertion had been adduced, and Henry himself denied its truth \u2014 still it was a matter which served as a pretext for delay. But, above all, a new document was introduced, which pur ported to be a papal ' breve ' of the same date with the licence for the marriage, and which was adapted to obviate difficulties that had been raised in the course of this discussion. Whence came this ' breve' ? The original was in Spain \u2014 it might be sent to Rome, but not to England. The question of the divorce was thus made to narrow itself into a question about the authenticity of this new instrument ; and that was a question which could only be settled in Rome. So the whole case was said to have reverted from the two commissioners to the pope. This new brief was no doubt a fabrication \u2014 known by Charles and Clement to have been such. But it accomplished its object. It sufficed to render all that had been done in London valueless. Henry was now made to understand, that if he would obtain his object, he must descend to plead his cause in a foreign court, and a court which had become the vassal of Spain.* When the question came to be, whether the king should submit to this, and even to without the slightest probability of gaining his object \u2014 or that he should resolve to settle this long-agitated affair by means of the au thorities within his own dominions, it was not diffi- * Herbert, 108-121."], [103, "HENRy VIII. AND WOLSEY. 81 cult to see the side of the alternative that would be book vi. chosen. In anticipation of some such issue, Henry Chaf\" '' had more than once declared, that in such case, the judgment of his own subjects should be his ultimate authority. Strong language was now everywhere heard, from ruling of the highest and from the lowest. It had been no wish of the English people that there should be war with the emperor. Few things to them could have been more unwelcome. But as little had it been their wish to see the crown of England thus virtually a suppli cant to the crown of Spain, and to an authority so notoriously weak, self-seeking, and pitiable as that exercised by the papal court. Such were the words which now came to the ear of Campeggio, that he told the pope he could not venture to repeat things so horrible. His holiness was left to imagine the worst as regarded the length to which this nation seemed prepared to go in its resentment.* Good men felt that the place which the name of Anne Boleyn had acquired in the history of this discussion was a circum stance to be regretted ; but the question of the succes sion as now raised, had come to be much too weighty a matter to be laid aside, or to be longer impeded by any foreign pretender whatsoever. Henry resolved to assemble a parliament, and with or that resolve came the fall of Wolsey. The cardinal dared not face such an assembly. In his prosperous days he had looked with suspicion on popular power in such forms. Such strength, and comparative indepen dence, in the subject, were incompatible, in his view, with adequate authority on the part of the crown. He could readily foresee what would now come from such a concentration of the popular feeling. He had ruined the trade of the country, and filled it with dis affection, that he might humble the emperor, and ensure obedience from the papacy. But the emperor * Burnet's Colled, p. 41. II O"], [104, "82 NATIONALISTS AND ROMANISTS. BOOK VI. Chap. i. had triumphed, and the pope had presumed to add insolence to denial. Nor was the fact of manifest failure all the difficulty with which he had to contend. Before this sinister removal of the divorce cause from London to Rome, Wolsey had shown signs of distrust in regard to a material point in relation to it, much to the displeasure of the king. Certainly, the impression came to be, that he had not recently done all he might have done to further the object.* And when unsteadi ness and failure in relation to this matter, came in the train of the many circumstances which had tended for so long a time to fill both court and country with dis affection towards him, it was no longer possible that he should avoid seeing the signs of the coming storm. It has been laid as a heavy charge upon Anne Boleyn, that she now became the enemy of the car dinal, though she had written to him in the most affectionate and grateful terms not long before. Anne Boleyn may have been at fault in this particular, but there had been time for change, and much more cause for it probably than has come to our knowledges Henry, no doubt, heard things from Anne, and from the nobles of his court, especially from Norfolk and * While Campeggio and Wolsey were holding their court of inquiry on this subject, the latter was one day sent for by Henry to his palace at Bridewell ; and on entering his barge to return b}' water from Blackfriars, ' the bishop of Carlisle, being with him in the barge, said to him (wiping the sweat from his face) : ' Sir,' quoth he, ' it is a very hot day.' ' Yea,' quoth the cardinal ; ' if ye had been as well chafed as I have been within this hour, ye would say it were very hot.' And as soon as he came home to his house at Westminster, he went incontinently to his naked bed.' \u2014 Cavendish, 225. If Wolsey really made the speech attributed to him by Cavendish at the breaking up of this court, justifying as it does the entire course taken by Campeggio, it is hardly surprising that the cardinal's earnestness in the cause came to be suspected. \u2014 Ibid. 233, 234. In fact, Wolsey appears to have had some reason for wishing that the pope should interpose to suspend proceedings, though he was by no means desirous to see him take the abrupt and extreme course adopted by him. \u2014 Herbert, 121. t It is not until Campeggio and Wolsey have agreed to declare their commission at an end and a failure, that Henry says to Anne : ' Why then, I perceive ye are not the cardinal's friend.' \u2014 Cavendish, 224."], [105, "83 HENRY VIII. AND WOLSEY. BOOK VI, Chap. i. Suffolk, which satisfied him that the man who had proved so useful to him through so long a period could be used no longer. But his course towards the falling minister was ungrateful, unjust, and, in the vacillations which characterized it, was both un manly and cruel. Henry's feeling and conscience disposed him towards leniency, but he allowed both to be neutralized at intervals by other influences. Wolsey was charged with having violated the pre munire statute, in his capacity as legate \u2014 an offence which entailed heavy penalties. His alleged delin quencies were set forth under forty-four heads. Against many of these charges he might have pleaded that they were not offences against law at all, or that they consisted of acts for which he had the licence and command of the king.* People wondered at the time that the cardinal did not take this ground of defence. Why he did not he afterwards explained to his faithful servant Cavendish. He knew that when the king had thus committed himself against him, nothing could be more galling to his irritable and violent temper than to find himself subject to such a recrimination. Wolsey judged, therefore, that he had less to fear from plead ing guilty, than from pleading not guilty ; and he no doubt judged correctly. f But, by this confession, his wealth and honours were all surrendered into the hands of his sovereign, and sad inroads were soon made upon them. As adversity came, it was at once mani fest, that the greatness of Wolsey had never been a self-reliant greatness. The loss of royal favour left him, in all senses, miserably poor. We have all read how, in the time of his disgrace, he drooped or re vived, from day to day, as the frown or the smile of * Herbert, 124-129.

Character os Wolsey, . the king was supposed to be directed towards him ; how the interval marked by such alternations of feeling was followed by his arrest on the charge of treason, at the close of his pilgrimage through Yorkshire ; and how this last stroke prostrated him in mind and body, so that he breathed his last in Leicester abbey, while on his way to meet the accusations which were to have been preferred against him. Wolsey lived to find that he was a man with many enemies and few friends. Such an experience was the natural result of his character and history. He was too much of an innovator not to be suspected of some unsoundness by the majority of Catholics ; and he was too truly a Catholic not to be an object of dislike to Protestants. Courtiers could hardly have been his friends, inasmuch as he accroached so many things to himself which they naturally thought would have been better bestowed if distributed among themselves; and the people were not likely to be well-affected towards him, inasmuch as he taxed them so heavily, made so light of their liberties, and showed so scornful an indifference to their feelings and prejudices. But unfavourable as this condition of parties may have been to the reputation of Wolsey with posterity, it would be an error to suppose that his memory has suffered greatly from these causes. His career was too public, and the means of information concerning him were too abundant, to allow of any general misapprehension in relation to him. It is no doubt true, that historians, in their estimates of such men, often run in one groove, contenting themselves with saying again what others have said before them. But it is no less true that a disposition towards reaction in such cases, is rarely found to halt at the right place. Exaggeration is its natural tendency. To take up the cause of men everywhere spoken against, may be generous \u2014 chivalrous ; but the cause may be hopeless, and the seeming chivalry of such efforts may be a snare. The verdict of history in regard to AVolsey is,"], [107, "HENRY VIII. AND WOLSEY. 85 BOOK VI, Chap. i. we believe, substantially just. Pleas may be urged in mitigation of penalties, but nothing more can be admitted. A man who could seek office and emolument as Wolsey sought them, may have been a man of a high order of ability in many ways, but he could never have been a man of elevated or refined feeling. Nor could he have been a man of the first rank in intelli gence. With every step in his advancement he grew to be more haughty, irritable, and overbearing. With every increase of his wealth he became more ostentatious in his whole manner of life. All men, save the king, were made to feel that they had to take their place below this man in respect to rank and power. All men, save the king, were made to feel that he eclipsed them in splendour as much as in authority. A man capable of rising from such an origin to such an eminence, might have been expected to see that the enemies made by such a passion for display, and by a demeanour so arrogant, must be many, and that the enmity thus created might some day become dangerous \u2014 ruinous. So Wolsey must have seen, had his genius been really profound and far reaching. But his wisdom never rose above the level of that worldly sort of wisdom which, speaking com paratively, is in its nature coarse and narrow. His greatness, for this reason, was at best but a vulgar greatness. He was not one of the rare men who have the honours of this world thrust upon them. He sought such things \u2014 sought them from first to last with an appetite that could never be satiated. His kindness to those dependents who were faithful to him, and his liberality towards persons of higher station who were prepared to further his objects, was a feudal quality which admitted of explanation without sup posing the presence of any extraordinary virtue ; and it should be added, that his remembrance of good offices was certainly not more conspicuous than the resentment with which he pursued all persons who"], [108, "86 NATIONALISTS AND ROMANISTS. BOOK VI. Chap, i. had been so unfortunate as to incur his displeasure. His attempts to improve the common administration of justice among the people were praiseworthy ; but Asiatic despots, and the ministers of such men, have often shown themselves zealous on the side of right in such relations. Even in his patronage of learning, which was unquestionably munificent, the cardinal evinced too much of the passion which always disposed him to over-rate the influence of secular pomp and splendour. With regard to those civil liberties which good men in past generations had braved so much, and endured so much, to obtain, Wolsey seemed hardly to know of their existence, and clearly was a man much more inclined to extinguish than to perpetuate them. We have seen that he would have brought all Englishmen to feel, and to avow, that in body and goods they were the king's. It was so in France, and he would have had it to be so in England, that so it might be manifest that the king of England was as great a king as the king of France. His foreign policy was invariably a mistake. During the greater part of his career he did nothing but conform himself to the national prejudice which accounted English men and Frenchmen as natural enemies, by encou raging the false, vain, and mischievous pretensions of the crown of England to the crown of France. By so doing, he contributed to give that ascendancy to Spain in the affairs of Europe which was not a little injurious in his own time, and which proved to be fraught with so much danger to the great interests of Christendom in the time to come. At last, war was declared against Spain, but it was not until the balance had been turned against France, and war with the emperor had come to be ruin to the English merchant. It was natural that England, from her position and her resources, should often act as a mediator between the rival powers of the continent ; but, unhappily, Wolsey's policy was always liable to be affected by"], [109, "87 HENRY VIII. AND WOLSEY. BOOK VI. Chap. i. personal and corrupt influences. His aim was not so much to ensure peace to Christendom, as to keep affairs in a constant state of fret and restlessness, so that there might always be occasion for English inter ference, and that England, by means of her exchequer, and her diplomatic meddlings, might acquire reputa tion as an arbiter of differences. It is not surprising that a policy so wanting in elevation should have been wanting in principle. Wolsey could dissemble, or lie, to any extent, when he imagined that the ends he had proposed to himself might be served by such means. It is to his honour, that zealous as he was in support of the papacy, he was much less disposed towards persecution than Sir Thomas More, or than the great majority of ecclesiastics in his day. Catherine charged him with leading a licentious life, and such a charge could hardly have come from such lips \u2014 and have been made as in the presence of the nation \u2014 on slight grounds. It is known that Wolsey left two natural children. But the graver accusations of this nature preferred against him are not proved. The nearest parallel in history to the career of Wolsey is furnished in the life of Granvelle, the great minister of Philip II. in the Netherlands. The father of Granvelle had been an attorney in moderate practice. The son received a liberal education, became an ecclesi astic, and rose through a succession of promotions to the rank of cardinal, and to the highest office as a minister of state. In his manner of life he outshone all the nobles of the old families in the Netherlands, and took precedence of them all in the favour of the king, and in the management of affairs. Disaffection con centrated itself upon him, both from the nobles and the people. It was felt that Granvelle must cease to be minister, and he retired altogether from the scene in which he had been the foremost man. But here the parallel ends both as regards the minister and the monarch. Granvelle relinquished his high place with out an act or a word which his enemies could say"], [110, "88 NATIONALISTS AND ROMANISTS. BOOK VI, Chap. i. Summary, betrayed a want of courage or dignity ; and in his retirement he made himself an attractive centre to the highest intelligence and culture of his time. Philip, too, in place of robbing his fallen minister, and break ing his heart, left him in possession of his large wealth, and ceased not to hold friendly correspondence with him. Such, then, was the general complexion of English history during the first twenty years of the reign of Henry VIII. There was no return of the civil strife of the last century, but men were not free from appre hension on that subject. Scotland was restless, and in league with her old allies the French ; but her policy was frustrated, and her military disasters were salutary in their influence on both nations. The king and his minister were inclined to dispense as much as possible with the aid of parliaments ; but that course could not be pursued more than partially. Attempts were made to raise money under the form of loans and benevolences at the king's pleasure. But the country had not lost its sense of freedom. The illegal pro ceedings were resisted, and the resistance was success ful. The cabinet would have had the king to be as little bound by parliaments as Francis I. The people, and especially the citizens of London, would have made him as obedient to the laws of parliament as Edward III. The people are loyal \u2014 enthusiastically loyal ; but they indulge in much freedom of speech concerning the conduct of the king, and the policy of his ministers, and their industrial power is in such vigorous life, that they become almost insurgent in their opposition to the measures of government when injurious to trade. At the same time, the martial ardour and proficiency of the country are well sus tained, especially along the border counties. Military incursions on France yield little honour or advantage, and our foreign policy is rarely wise or efficient. But, on the whole, the temper of the country is a manly temper. The signs of its capacity for action,"], [111, "89 HENRY VIII. AND WOLSEY. BOOK VI. Chap. i. and of its disposition towards action, are becoming more conspicuous every day, and seem to promise that England will play no mean part in the great struggle which new principles and new feelings must soon bring into existence over the greater part of Europe. Towards this result the recent exhibitions of papal weakness and duplicity could not fail to minister very materially. Much, too, was taking place during these first twenty years in the reign of Henry VIII., both among the people and in our seats of learning, which showed that the seed sown by our earlier ecclesiastical reformers had not perished ; and which showed, no less clearly, that the great religious movement in Germany was destined to do no mean work in Eng land, notwithstanding the royal treatises and royal proclamations opposed to it. This phase of English life will claim the attention of the reader in the next chapter."], [112, "CHAPTER II.

The conser vative element in all social institutions will be found to consist in their real or supposed good ; it does not lie wholly or mainly in their evil. The church of Rome herself, in her early days, became strong by means of her better tendencies, in defiance of many tendencies which were of an opposite description. Her form of Christianity, imperfect as it may have been, was a comparatively benign influence, and men trea sured and transmitted it accordingly. Some conces sion of this nature, we presume, should be made in favour of English Protestantism. If it has become a power, this must have been because it has had its good reasons to rest upon, and its good work to do. It is true it was left to the bold hand of Henry VIII. to strike the blow which should sever us from the papacy. But it is also true that kings, however arbitrary, are not omnipotent. Their power is always a borrowed power. Sovereigns are strong only as their subjects are with them. Henry VIII. greatly valued the good opinion and the loyal feeling of his subjects. Nor was"], [113, "REFORM BEFORE THE REFORMATION PARLIAMENT. 91 he a prince wholly without circumspection or self- book vi. government. When he meditated separating England \u00b0HAF' *' from Rome, he must have known, that rash as such a policy might seem, the feeling of the nation would be found prepared to sustain it. If the case so stood, it is clear, that to find the origin of this memorable re volution, we must go beyond the passions of the king. We must look carefully to the thought and temper of the times. The influence of Henry and of Anne Boleyn was great; but that influence came in the train of many other influences which were greater, and without which such personal inclinations could never have led to such results as are before us in history. The quiescence of the past had ceased. The conflict which was soon to be characteristic of the present had commenced. The principles which ultimately pre vailed in the approaching struggle must have been the strongest. Among the causes which contributed largely to the Effect in . o . , \u00bb England of progress of the doctrines of the Reformation in Eng- the revival land, we must reckon the great revival of letters and of letters' art. In the time of Henry VIII. this cause had be come powerful enough to give a new impress to the his tory of Europe. What was taking place in this respect had ceased to be dependent on individual patronage \u2014 it had become in a great measure the action of society. Throughout the Middle Age there were always Eng lishmen who distinguished themselves in the schools of Italy. In Padua, Bologna, and elsewhere, their shields may still be seen on the walls set apart to such memorials of academic eminence. But the learning which now came from Italy came with a peculiar mission. It \u2022 was cherished by many purely for its own sake. It awakened new tastes, and it gratified them. It did not make our forefathers infidels, after the manner of the Roman courtiers. Nor did it merely supply them, in the manner of their ancestors, with new weapons wherewith to defend the received ecclesiastical system. Its great work was to give them a better knowledge"], [114, "92 NATIONALISTS AND ROMANISTS. BOOK VI. Chap. z. Learned men in England, of the sacred scriptures, and by that means to deepen their religious feeling, so as to prepare them in due time for following in the wake of Protestant Germany. The effects of the religious and political teaching which had characterized the latter half of the four teenth century were by no means extinct. Among leading men, and especially among the people, the traces of that teaching were still largely perceptible, and it did much to prepare not a few to hail that ' new learning,' the effects of which were to be so memorable. It should be remembered, however, that the great work of the fifteenth century was not so much to produce as to restore. Very few works then written are now read. But the works which were then cleansed from the dust, and freed in great part from the injuries which time had brought upon them, became the guide and stimulus of the creative power which was soon to be awakened by them. What classical men did for their classics, biblical men were to do for their Bibles. The one party created a new era in taste, the other was to create a new era in religious thought. Among the distinguished foreigners in the literary gatherings of Florence towards the close of the fifteenth century, were several Englishmen. Selling, Grocyn, Linacre, Lilly, and Latimer are among the names mentioned. Selling was an ecclesiastic, and became known afterwards by his zeal in collecting manuscripts; Grocyn became professor of Greek in Oxford; and Linacre, who, in the judgment of Erasmus, was the best scholar in Italy, practised medicine. Sir Thomas More, begging a visit from dean Colet, says : ' Mean ' while, I pass my time with Grocyn, Linacre, and ' Lilly. The first, as you know, is sole master of my ' life in your absence ; the second, the preceptor of my ' studies ; the third, my dearest companion in all I ' undertake.'* These were all young men at the time * Cayley's Life of More, i. 26."], [115, "REFORM BEFORE THE REFORMATION PARLIAMENT. 93 of which we speak. Among the scholars then resident bookvi. in Florence, through the munificent patronage of the Chap z' Medici, were Politian and Chalcondyles. The meetings in the apartments of the Medici, when the welcome temperature of the Italian summer evening came on, consisted often of such spirits, who there contributed from the stores of their common knowledge to their common pleasure, and to their mutual growth in all things pertaining to the new culture. But such men must have felt that there was little Keig-n of hope for England while Henry VII. lived.* That Hear> v monarch was truly our Louis XI. The shadow of his avarice was favourable to the growth of no good thing. Under a succession of such kings the old heart and temper of the English nation must have died out. His only notion of liberty was a notion of the licence proper to a king, and the value even of such licence was determined too much by the gain in money which it might be made to yield. The quietude of his reign was more the quietude of death than of sound health. Henry VII. had, no doubt, his work to do in that transition stage of our history. But with the acces sion of the next Henry society began to give new signs of life. Henry VIII. had a real sympathy with learning, Early years and a sincere respect for learned men. For such tastes viil\"^ he had been much indebted to his grandmother, the excellent countess of Richmond.

Among the persons whom the countess of Rich mond honoured with her confidence was Lord Mount joy. It happened that Mountjoy, while in Paris, met Erasmus, then a young man, whose fame was in great part to come. Charmed with his learning and wit, and especially with his disposition to employ such powers in exposing the follies of the Schoolmen and the Mendicants, Mountjoy invited the rising scholar to England. Erasmus, fearing the plague, which then raged about him, gladly accepted the invitation. Soon after his arrival he dined with the lord mayor. Oppo site him at table was a young man under twenty, who attracted his attention. He was of a slender make, light complexion, his one shoulder rising some what above the other. But there was geniality and gaiety in the play of his blue eyes, and of his features generally. His pleasant jests were many, and, to the surprise of Erasmus, he could be merry, not only in English or French, but in Latin or Greek. The trial of skill between the two strangers became a smart one. The Dutchman had not been wont to meet with his equal in such encounters ; and having heard of a young English scholar named More, who was the only person he could suppose capable of such fencing as he now encountered, he at length ex claimed, ' Thou art either More or nobody' \u2014 where upon More rejoined, and ' Thou art either Erasmus ' or the devil.' The two scholars became fast friends from that day. But this was not the only occasion of surprise awaiting Erasmus in England. In Oxford, he made the acquaintance of John Colet, a man of. family and wealth, of admirable presence, whose residence every where reflected his gentlemanly culture. Colet, we have seen, was a friend of More's, but somewhat older. His table was excellent, and open to all men of learn ing. Erasmus congratulated himself that he had"], [117, "REFORM BEFORE THE REFORMATION PARLIAMENT. 95 exchanged the stale eggs and sour wine of the scholars book vi. in Paris for more courtly fare in Oxford. But what CaAV1 was more grateful to him, at Colet's table he met accomplished scholars. Amongst them were Grocyn, Linacre, and Latimer, and Mr. Thomas Wolsey, then a bursar at Magdalen, afterwards cardinal. ' I cannot 'tell you,' says Erasmus, in writing to his friend Mountjoy, ' how much I am delighted with your ' England. I could be content to live in Scythia with ' such men.' Erasmus was as familiar with Cam bridge as with Oxford. During this visit he became Margaret professor of divinity in the former uni versity, and delivered lectures there on Greek. But he did not meet with the encouragement he had ex pected, and his services were not long-continued. It was the manner of that age to regard the good Erasmus estate of learning as very insecure if not sustained vm. e\" by the patronage of princes. It is all well, so far, said Erasmus to More, but where is your Octavius, your M\u00e6cenas, your Medici ? Go with me to Eltham, was the reply, and perhaps I can show you an answer to your question ; and to Eltham they went. Eltham was the residence of lord and lady Mountjoy, who had the charge of the king's children. There Erasmus began his acquaintance with Henry duke of York, then in the tenth year of his age, and afterwards Henry VIII. He was delighted with the acquire ments of the young prince, with his capacity, and his love of learning. On his return to the continent he spoke of England as the home of scholarly men, and as not without her Octavius. On the accession of prince Henry to the crown, Mountjoy wrote to Erasmus : ' Our Octavius is on the throne ; come, be ' hold the new star ; all things are changed.' Erasmus, indeed, had received letters from the young king, in creditable Latin, expressing the warmest affection towards him, and urging his return to England. He at length took leave of the pope, bid adieu to Italy, and found court and college in this country prepared to give him a cordial welcome."], [118, "96 NATIONALISTS AND ROMANISTS. BOOK VI. Chap. z. Progress of the new learning in Oxford. liise of Sir Thomas More Oxford now became the seat of one of those move ments which have been so frequent in her history, and which have never failed to make themselves felt in the remotest provinces of the kingdom. Classical literature had come, to a considerable extent, into the place of scho lastic literature, though few classical works were printed in this country, in whole or in part, until towards the close of this period. The sacred scriptures, not merely in the Vulgate, but in the Greek, became familiar to many. The taste for antiquity, and the theology of the New Testament, were alike unfavourable to a con tinuance of the dogmas and superstitions of the Middle Age. Men began to fling: their sarcasms with a new freedom at the idleness, immorality, and insincerity of the clergy, especially of the religious orders.* For the present, indeed, such licence was not to be in dulged on all occasions. Men in authority did not look on without distrust. But the new studies, which had awakened this new feeling, were a force not to be resisted. The king was not disposed to resist it. The cardinal knew that the attempt would be vain \u2014 worse than vain. His flatterers called upon him to be the M\u00e6cenas, or the ' Ptolemy,' as the phrase was, of the movement ; and his policy and his vanity concurred in suggesting that it became him to take that position. His patronage, accordingly, was never more imposing than when bestowed on learning or on learned men. In a suit which arose between the pope and the king concerning a rich vessel which had entered Southampton, More had been chosen by Wolsey to plead the cause of his holiness.

More was made Master of Requests, and within a month was knighted, and became a privy councillor. The king greatly prized the ability of the new states man. He scarcely allows him to leave him, says Erasmus. If he needs help in serious matters, he has not a better adviser ; if he would relax his mind, he knows not a more festive companion.! Henry often sent for More to confer with him in his closet on astronomy, geometry, divinity, and other subjects, and might sometimes be seen walking with him on the leads of the house, conversing about the distances and laws of the heavenly bodies. When More did not come often enough to the palace, Henry would go without state to Chelsea, and would take his place at the family board, contented with the humblest fare that might chance to be placed before him. J To many minds these appearances were full of promise for the future. ' Where,' said Erasmus, ' is the Athens, the ' Porch, or the Academy to compare with the court of ' England? The royal residence is not so much a ' palace as a seat of the Muses. The Golden Age ' returns. I congratulate the world.' The year in which More became a courtier, was that in which Luther signalized himself by his oppo sition to indulgences. Much blame was now cast upon Erasmus. His attacks on the clergy, it was said, had their natural issue in such disorders. He had laid the egg, Luther had only hatched it. His retort was \u2014 The egg laid by me was a hen's egg, that hatched by Luther has given a bird of another kind. * Cayley's Life of More, i. 74, 1 5. f Epist. ad Hutten. % Roper's Life of More.

Already his position lay at about an equal distance between the two great parties\u2014 the men opposed to all change, and the thorough reformers. More was the only man of the former class who could measure strength with him. The leanings of Colet, now dean of St. Paul's, were to the other side.

These were bold words. The crowd of citizens who listened were delighted. They returned to their homes declaring Colet to be another St. Paul. But three prelates, one of whom was Fitz-James, bishop of London, denounced the dean to the archbishop of Canterbury. Wareham was not a metropolitan to take a harsh course towards such a man. He did what Colet had refused to do \u2014 he vindicated what had been said. Greeks and The lectures of Gtocvh in Oxford on Greek attracted oxford.* much attention, and called forth much opposition.

One of these gentlemen attacked the Greeks, as they were called, in the university pulpit. More addressed a Latin epistle to the university, expressing his regret that Oxford, always supposed to be in advance of Cambridge as a liberal instructor, should be losing her place, for the authorities of Cambridge, to their honour, were encouraging the study of Greek.* * ' Notwithstanding the assertions of Antony Wood, there can he no doubt that Cambridge was, during the whole of this reign, at least on a"], [121, "REFORM BEFORE THE REFORMATION PARLIAMENT. 99 He further reminded these Trojans, that in this war they book vi. were opposed to their own chancellor, Wareham, to the C\"A1' z cardinal, and to the king himself. Henry, indeed, enjoyed the contention between these parties, and was often pleased with the opportunity of letting a Greek loose upon a Trojan. But the whisper through all the confessionals was \u2014 ' Beware of the Greeks, if you ' would not be a heretic' The grammar school of St. Paul's, founded by the liberality of Colet, was especially denounced, as the horse of the perjured Sinon, from which every kind of mischief would come forth.* But upon no man did the resentments of the old Persecution routine ecclesiastics of England fall so heavily as upon Erasmus. Standish, bishop of St. Asaph, especially embodied this feeling, and resolved to act upon it. The name, St. Asaph, was sometimes abbreviated as St. Ass ; and Erasmus, after his manner, had spoken of Standish as being somewhat appropriately the bishop of a diocese with such a title. The bishop felt this bit of humour the more, inasmuch as it was no secret that his learning was not such as to bear a close scrutiny. The proceedings of Standish sufficed to show, that the time had come in which Erasmus must relinquish his footing in England, or retain it by braving something in its defence. But deep convic tion on grave subjects, and the courage which such conviction imparts, did not belong to the character of Erasmus. He had a quick perception of moral dis tinctions and proprieties, and an exquisite sense of the ridiculous ; but he wanted the conscientious thorough- ness necessary to the really great man. In this view, compared with Luther, his mind was feeble and level with the sister university, and, indeed, to speak plainly, above it.' \u2014 Hallam's Introduct. Lit. i. 469. * Cayley's More, i. 80.

The Greek Testament by Eras- mus, fragile. Henceforward, the great man of letters gives place considerably in the public eye to the great man in the religious sense. We hear less of Erasmus and more of Luther. Nevertheless, Erasmus had still his great work to do, though a work to be done without noise. This was to retire to Basle, and there to labour, and to constrain others to labour, at the printing of his Greek Testament. That work was his great gift to the cause of Protestantism, but a gift which contributed to the progress of that memorable revolution in a degree not intended by its author. Erasmus tells us, that his labour in producing his Greek Testament was such that he should hardly be credited were he to relate it. He collected many manuscripts, and surrounded himself with the com mentaries of the best of the fathers, that he might lack no aid in getting at the true meaning of a text. In Hebrew criticism he was assisted by Capito, still more by (Ecolampadius. So many were the exception able renderings found in the Vulgate, that he collected and printed them.* What he saw of the probable result of his labours sustained him in the prosecution of them. If the ship of the church is to be saved from the tempest, it must be, he said, by the word which has come from the bosom of the Father, and which still lives in the gospels. f In vain will men seek to slake their thirst in human reservoirs, their waters are stagnant and fetid. Others may contribute marble, and ivory, and gold towards raising a spiritual temple in desolated Christendom, it belonged to him, a poor and insignificant person, to offer a stone that should be laid at the foundation. Nor was this all. Not only would he that men should be free to read the gospel in Greek, he would have all men read it in their own tongue. It might be expedient that the secrets of kings should be concealed, but the mysteries of Christ should be published. ' The Holy Scriptures * Eras.

The husbandman should sing them as ' he holds the handle of his plough ; the weaver repeat ' them as he plies his shuttle; and the wearied traveller, ' halting on his journey, refresh him under some shady ' tree by these goodly narratives.'* The affection with which thoughtful and earnest h\u00bb recep men received the Greek Testament realized the most sanguine hopes of Erasmus. The book was sought after with intense interest, and retained as a priceless treasure. But much followed which Erasmus had not foreseen. The religious orders, and not a few among the clergy, took alarm. The feeling seemed to spread as an infection. The confessionals were all tuned to one note. If this new book should be allowed a free circulation, the land would be overrun with heresy \u2014 not one stone would be left upon another in church or state ! Erasmus was amazed at this storm. It is clear that Tue 8torm had he foreseen it, he would hardly have chosen a course of action so inconvenient. But the work was done ; and now he could only aver that he had done it believing it to be a good work, that it would be ac ceptable to the Lord, and for the good of his church, f But such professions availed him little. He had been so presumptuous as to suppose that he could amend the Vulgate. He would be accounted more holy than St. Jerome. He would set aside a version consecrated by the common consent of the church, and inspired by the Holy Ghost. He had dared to erase the word penance, substituting repentance in its stead. In short, the whole book was the work of an heresiarch \u2014 of an antichrist. So did these men rave. The generalissimo in this anti-biblical crusade was Edward Lee, archbishop of York.

The Trojan preaches before the king. England. The archbishop was not a scholar in the judgment of scholars ; nor was he a religious man in the judgment of men who were thoughtful on that subject. He had now made the discovery that from Erasmus no good thing could come. His Greek Testament was said to be full of errors of the most frightful and mischievous description. Every possible effort was made to diffuse this impression. Good dinners were given, letters were written, agents were employed, criticisms were privately printed, all that could be done was done to sink the reputation of Erasmus, and to raise that of his most orthodox oppo nent upon its ruins. Erasmus knew all this. ' Why,' said he, ' be so modest as to print only for private ' circulation? Why not publish on the subject? Who ' can tell but that the holy fathers, in appointing you ' the Aristarchus of letters, may be willing to give you ' a birch to keep the world in order?'* One of the archbishop's alarmists was called to preach before the king. His majesty was known to have been the friend of Erasmus, and was suspected of being inclined toward the new learning. To put an end to such influences in that quarter would be a great work. But the preacher on this occasion was not equal to the task he had assumed. He declaimed, indeed, with great fluency against the Greek and its patrons, but in such style that Henry was seen to be more disposed to smile than to frown. When the service was over, the talk ran high against the preacher. ' Bring the priest to me,' said the king, and, turning to More, he added, ' you shall defend the cause of the ' Greeks, and I will listen.' But there was no dispu tation.

' By the spirit book vi ' of folly, be sure of it,' said Henry, ' and not by the CnAr z' ' spirit of Christ. Have you ever read Erasmus ?' \u2022 No, sire,' was the answer. ' Away with you, then,' said the king ; ' are you not a pretty blockhead ?' ' And yet,' said the culprit, ' I remember reading some thing about Moria' (Erasmus, in praise of Folly). ' With that subject,' said an attendant, ' he ought to ' be very familiar.' Still trembling, but hoping to abate the severity of his doom, the delinquent said, ' I ' am not against the Greek altogether, seeing that it ' comes from the Hebrew !' With the loud laugh thus raised the curtain fell on this pleasant comedy.* In Oxford, the ' Obscurants,' as these opposers of The ob the new light were sometimes called, were better re- 8Curant8 presented. But the cause was a bad one, and no representation of it could make it otherwise. To allege that the Greek Testament ought not to be read, was to say that it ought not to have been written, and that the utterances of which it is the record ought not to have been made. To the people these communica tions were made then, why should they not be made to them now ? To this reasoning the Obscurants had nothing to oppose that could bear the slightest ex amination. Their only successful weapon consisted in vague declamations about all sorts of known or unknown evils which it was said must come from such reading. But in college and convent, in the homes of the wealthy, and of the middle and humbler classes, there was light enough to cause debates on this subject to become frequent and earnest. One instance may suffice to show the manner mnowcon which this leaven was diffused. In Trinity College, iTa*\u2122\" Cambridge, there was a young man engaged in the study of the canon law, remarkable for his seriousness, his modesty, and his conscientiousness. His priest was to his soul what his physician was to his body. * Eras. Ep. 347, 914."], [126, "104 NATIONALISTS AND ROMANISTS. BOOK VI, Chap. z.

Masses, vigils, indulgences, and free contributions in money, all were tried, but the patient only seemed to grow worse. At times, the thought would arise \u2014 ' Am I in the right path ? May not the ' priest be in error, or be a self-seeker in all he does ?' But the suspicion was instantly rejected as a sugges tion from the enemy. One day the troubled scholar heard two friends talking of a new book. The book was the Greek Testament by Erasmus, with an elegant Latin translation. The scholar was pleased with the sound of the Latin, and would fain have taken up the volume and have examined it. But he knew that the authorities of the university had condemned all such books, and especially that book, as tending to nothing but heresy. He abstained ; but his desire to look into that volume grew stronger. He stole into the house in Cambridge where the book was secretly sold. Having obtained a copy, he returned to his room to read it, and the first text that arrested his attention read, ' This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all ' acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world ' to save sinners, of whom I am chief.' This was to the spirit-worn student as the voice of an oracle. He pondered it, and derived from it what the priestly im positions to which he had so long submitted had failed to give him, peace of conscience and enlargement of heart. Henceforth he sits at the feet of his Lord, and of his inspired messengers. His religious life becomes not only happier, but deeper. This young scholar was Thomas Bilney, one of the earliest and holiest martyrs of the English Reformation.* The reader will have seen that the arguments used to show that scholars should be allowed to read the Scriptures in Greek, were such as might be used with * Thorn.

The ' Obscurants' Chaf' z were alive to this fact. It was, indeed, the great secret of the zeal evinced by the more sagacious among them on this subject. But were the people of Eng land desirous of such a privilege ? Were they pre pared to read the Scriptures in English if made ac cessible to them ? The histories of England most read among us give no answer to this question. But the records of the time furnish large evidence in relation to it. They disclose to us the early germinating of those great principles which were to rise from the popular mind to minds of a higher order, and to issue, in their time, in the English Reformation. The episcopal registries in England in the early years of the sixteenth century, contain many entries concerning persons who were examined as accused, or suspected, of holding heretical opinions. We select a single record of this description, and restrict ourselves to entries in a single year, viz., the register of Long land, bishop of Lincoln, relating to proceedings in the county of Buckingham in 1521. The course taken in these examinations, was to re- wyciitntes quire the accused parties to bind themselves by oath to answer all questions that should be put to them. To re-them fuse the oath was to be accounted heretical ; and to take it was, in most instances, to be perjured, or to become a self-convicted heretic. Nor was this all\u2014 the victims were made in this manner to answer questions so as not only to convict themselves, but to convict others. The consequence was, that husbands gave evidence against their wives, and wives against their husbands, children against their parents, and parents against their children.

From the mercilessness with which questions were urged, the evidence of some one timid and conscientious sufferer was sometimes made to embrace scores of persons, and must have sent"], [128, "106 NATIONALISTS AND ROMANISTS. BOOK VI, Chap. z. suspicion and alarm over a whole district.* From the disclosures made, it appears that the men and women holding the prohibited opinions were distinguished in the common language of the time as ' known,' \u2014 that is, as suspected, or marked persons. In innumerable ways, the peculiarities of persons of this description would be sure to betray them. It was their manner to meet together in lesser or greater numbers for the purpose of religious reading and conference. Printed books were hardly known among them. But they had succeeded in secreting a great number of manuscript books. Those found in possession of one person of this class are said to have been worth a hundred marks, not less than 200/. of our money. Those pos sessed by others were in several instances of consider able value. They consisted chiefly of portions of Wycliffe's New Testament in English. Some pos sessed mere fragments of that precious volume ; some a whole gospel ; some the four gospels ; one treasured up an epistle, another several, or the whole. Wycliffe's Wicket, and some of his shorter exposi tions appear to have been especially familiar to them ; and a book of a similar description, intitled the Shepherd's Calendar. Associations were formed to hear these books read. They passed also in loan from family to family, and from one to another. Their cost, as well as the danger of possessing them, disposed many to commit large portions of them to memory, and what they had so learnt was often recited at length for the instruction and comfort of others. The opinions embraced by these people were those which had descended to them from the times ot * It is important, on account of much that will claim the attention of the reader elsewhere, that the exact features of these prosecutions should be marked \u2014 accused parties who dared not perjure themselves, were com pelled to reveal their thoughts ; the thoughts so revealed were accounted crimes ; and the crimes so brought to light were punished with every grade of punishment down to death at the stake."], [129, "REFORM BEFORE THE REFORMATION PARLIAMENT. 107 BOOK VI Chap z. Wycliffe. They did not believe in transubstantiation. They denied to pope, prelate, or priest the authority to absolve from sin, affirming that power to belong to the Saviour alone. They spoke of confession to a priest, and of the doctrine of purgatory, as inventions of the clergy. They condemned the worship of images and relics. They denounced pilgrimages to holy places as vain and demoralizing ; and they urged on all who were believers in these doctrines to marry only among themselves. In respect to these opinions, they were found to be nearly all of one mind.* The numbers who were thus arraigned in Bucking hamshire alone, and in this one year, we cannot count. Several scores are mentioned by name. Others appear to have been disposed of more summarily. The penalties inflicted were various. Some were made to do public and degrading penance. Others were burnt in the cheek, so as to be made to carry the brand of heresy in the sight of every one to their grave. Others were treated as convicts, and sent to the different religious houses, to be retained there at pleasure in the condition of bondsmen. Of such as were adjudged 'relapsed,' \u2014 that is, as heretics after abjuration, six were condemned to the stake. In the case of one of these, named John Scrivener, as in the case of one Tylesworthy, in the same county, some years before, the hand compelled to apply the * In 151 1, a great number of persons in Kent were found to have em braced the above doctrines; several were burnt.

Many abjured, and those who had so done were accepted as witnesses against others. One woman, sixty years of age, was burnt on evidence which had been extorted from her own husband, and from two of her own sons.

BOOK VI Chap. z. torch to the faggot was that of the daughter of the victim !* Now we have no reason to suppose that the new opinions were more prevalent in Buckinghamshire than in the other counties of England. Certain it is, that the bishop of Lincoln and his coadjutors had come to believe that nothing short of the severest measures would suffice to deter a multitude of persons from casting off all subjection to the sort of teaching which the church had recognized. Nothing would seem to have been further from the thoughts of the ruling clergy than the suspicion that the opinions avowed by these people were in fact rational and scrip tural, and might possibly become the opinions of the most enlightened minds in this great nation. No doubt, if we could have gone to the homes, or to the secret gatherings of these peasants and artisans, shop keepers and traders, we should have found among them persons who might be justly described as igno rant, narrow-minded, and fanatical. But all would not be of that character ; and, with all their faults, it is among this people that we find Lutheranism in England before Luther, and the germs of a real Pro testantism long before the protest which originated that name had been made. From such men the * See the contents of the Register as given in Foxe, Acts and Mon.

English version of the scriptures by the aid of the Enghs!!. printing press. About nine miles from Bristol, on the road which in stage-coach days led from that city to Gloucester, there is a curve where the wheels of the traveller turn northward, crossing ere long a high ground, open as sheep-walk, and patched with furze and heather. The slope from the left of that road, as it crosses that open land, descends into one of the most fertile sections of the vale of Gloucester. The landscape is full of English beauty, undulated and richly wooded, with spire and turret seen here and there above, or between, the wooded level, and made bright still, as in centuries past, by many a rising or setting sun. Through the midst of that valley the broad red waters of the Severn are seen to flow on towards the estuary of the Wye, curving from that point into the Bristol Channel. That noble river, some miles in width, separates the high lands of Mon mouthshire, the country of Caractacus and his Silures, from the ancient home of other British tribes on this side its banks. The district is rich in traces of the past, in the remains of Roman encampments, Roman villas, and Norman castles. So abundant were its religious establishments, that the expression, ' as sure ' as God is in Gloucestershire,' came to be a common expression to denote certainty. On the edge of the valley, and about a mile from the road of which we have spoken, the small town of Sodbury is visible. Near that town, in the time of Henry VIII., stood an old hall, which, like many structures of its class in that day, was spacious in its dimensions, but irregularly built, decorated with ancient evergreens, and overshadowed in its approaches by the more ancient elm, and oak, and yew-tree. The owner of this mansion was Sir John Walsh, an accomplished"], [132, "110 NATIONALISTS AND ROMANISTS. BOOK VI Chat. z. gentleman, who had acquired reputation and royal favour in the jousts and entertainments of the court. His lady was one of those true English women, who, to the accomplishments proper to their sex, and the virtues of the good superintendent of household matters, have added the feeling which has given them an interest in questions concerning the honour of their country and of religion. Behind the hall, at the end of the yew-tree walk, was the small church of St. Adeline, where Sir John and his dependents formed nearly the whole congregation. The knight was hospitable. Men of position in the neighbourhood, especially the more wealthy ecclesi astics, were often found at his table. But among the inmates of the hall was a priest, who preached in the little church on Sunday, and acquitted himself as tutor to the young Walshes during the week. This man, then about thirty-six years of age, was a close student, earnestly religious, very familiar with his Greek Testament, and much out of mood with the prevailing ideas and usages in regard to religion. Judging from what is now known of him, his head and features were such as bespoke capacity, serious ness, and firmness, with enough of a relish for humour to prompt him at times to subject a question to the test of ridicule. We speak now of the first half-dozen years after 1.520, during which time great stir was made both by prince and prelate to put down heresy, and to keep out Lutheranism. The ecclesiastics who visited Sir John, talked at table on such matters, and often in a style neither very intelligent nor very tolerant. But the tutor priest never failed to convert such discoursings into discussions. In these debates, it was his manner to take his Greek Testament from his side pocket, and, opening it on the table, to place his finger on passage after passage as his proofs. As will be supposed, this fencing was not always calmly conducted. The blood sometimes grew hot on both sides. In one instance,"], [133, "REFORM BEFORE THE REFORMATION PARLIAMENT. Ill when the authority of the law of God in the scriptures book vi, was insisted on, a priest was bold enough to say, ' We CnAr \"' ' could do better without God's law than without the ' pope's law ;' to which the tutor rejoined, ' I defy the ' pope, and all his laws \u2022 and, if God spare my life, ere ' many years, I will cause the boy who driveth the ' plough to know more of scripture than you do.' Of course, the man who so spoke soon became a ' known' man. The priests used the confessional, and even frequented the benches of the ale-house, for the purpose of filling the neighbourhood with the rumour of heresy as harboured at the hall. The reputed heretic, however, continued to preach in village and town when permitted. In Bristol, he preached in the open air, upon the college green, then called St. Austin's green. But everywhere he was tracked, and the cry of heresy followed. The preacher deplored his inability to deal single-handed with an enemy whose name was legion. By one expedient only could he hope to become enough like Briareus to meet such odds, and that would be by translating the New Testa ment into the spoken language of his country, and by j)rinting it for general circulation. The English Tes tament might do for the people what the Greek Testament had done for himself. He decided, accor dingly, to leave Sodbury, and to seek the quiet of another home for the prosecution of his object. Already he had been summoned before the chancellor of the diocese, and escaped only through the absence of the witnesses who had been expected to appear against him.* In this narrative we give the life of William J\u2122JJS Tyndale, up to the time of his committing himself to his great work \u2014 the translating and printing of the * Foxe, Acts and Mon.

The tutor at the hall had not forfeited the friendship of Sir John, or of Lady Walsh, by his supposed heresies. The worthy knight gave him introductions to influential persons, both lay and clerical, in London. By this means Tyndale obtained ready access to the pulpits of the metropolis, especially to St. Dunstan's, in Fleet-street, where his doctrine, though deduced for himself from scripture, was on many points substantially the doctrine attributed at that time to Luther. Tonstal, the bishop of London, was a zealous student of Greek. Tyndale sent him a translation of Isocrates ; and, encouraged by the patronage which Sir John's letters had secured for him, he aspired to the office of chaplain to the bishop. But Tonstal's love of Greek had been more literary than theological. It had not made him a reformer \u2014 far from it. The bishop had probably the means of knowing, that the opinions of the suitor were too much of the sort which he had shown himself more disposed to persecute than to encourage. It is certain that Tyndale retired from the presence of Tonstal so far affected by the cold courtesy of his manner, as to determine from that time to look no more to episcopal influence for the furtherance of his object.* Tyndale's preaching had made him friends among the laity of the metropolis. One of these, a rich mer chant named Humphrey Monmouth, having heard of his failure with the bishop, generously said, ' Come ' and live with me, and under my roof you can employ ' yourself as you please.' Monmouth was a citizen of high reputation, a man of an eminently Christian spirit, and his house and table were open to all men who were known to be desirous of seeing the mind of the people brought under a purer religious influence. We are not surprised, accordingly, to find such men * Tyndale's Boctrinal Treatises, 395, 396. Foxe, Acts and Mon. ubi supra."], [135, "REFORM BEFORE THE REFORMATION PARLIAMENT. 113 BOOK VI CHAr. z. as Hugh Latimer among the guests who availed themselves of his hospitality. In the house of Humphrey Monmouth, Tyndale was joined by the pious and learned John Frith, eminent as a mathematician of King's College, Cam bridge. The two Christian scholars there laboured together, translating chapter after chapter of the New Testament from the Greek into the spoken English of their time. But Longland, whose zeal against heresy had produced so much excitement in Buckingham shire, wrote letters to Tonstal, to the cardinal, and to the king, assuring them that the favourers of Luther anism in London were very many, and urging that strong measures should be taken against them. Nor did he urge in vain. Many persons were seized, and were severely dealt with. Their offence, however, rarely extended beyond their being known to have read some fragments of scripture in English. But, if that be so great a crime, said Tyndale, what will my sin be deemed in attempting to make the whole volume familiar to the people in their mother tongue ? He began to fear, and not without reason, that the stake might put an end to his labour before his work was done. He determined, in consequence, to remove to Holland. Monmouth and his friends supplied him with money. After awhile, the exile removed from Hamburg to Cologne, where the facilities for printing were greater. Quental and Bryckmans, printers in that city, had premises in St. Paul's churchyard, London, for the deposit and sale of their books. Tyndale arranged with these persons for printing 3000 copies of his English Testament.* It so happened, that at this juncture, Cochl\u00e6us, dean of Frankfort, one of the most bitter enemies of the reformers, came to Cologne. Cochl\u00e6us, too, had work for the printers above named, and it chanced, that in free table talk, words were dropped to the * Anderson's Annals of Eng. Bih. Biographical Notice of Tyndale. II I"], [136, "114 NATIONALISTS AND ROMANISTS. BOOK VI Chap. z. effect that Henry and the cardinal might be vigilant, but there was a scheme on foot which would place England on the side of the Lutherans. Cochl\u00e6us resolved if possible to detect this supposed conspiracy. In a subsequent interview with one of the printers, he induced the man to take wine freely, and by that means possessed himself of the secret. Three thou sand copies of an English Testament were in the press. Fourscore quarto pages were worked off. English merchants had supplied the money, and would see that they were so imported as to be in circulation before the government should be aware of what was doing. The next step of the dean was to see one Herman Rincke, a member of the senate of Cologne, and to prevail on him to move that body so as to frustrate this undertaking. This was done, and officers were despatched to seize the property.* But Tyndale, while he lived in secret, was careful to make himself acquainted with what the public were about. He had become aware of these proceedings. He succeeded in conveying the sheets from the prin ters' office to a vessel on the Rhine, and ascending the river, found a more secure asylum at Worms. There his work was accomplished. The quarto edition, indeed, does not appear to have been completed. But an octavo edition, which was much preferable in many respects, was put in the way of finding a place among the most treasured possessions of many a family in England. Cochl\u00e6us, irritated by his failure, wrote to Henry and to Wolsey, apprising them of what had happened, and entreating them to cause the ports of England to be guarded against the introduction of the ' baneful merchandise,' which would no doubt be covertly sent thither, f Such precautions were taken, but with no great * Cochl\u00e6us, Opp. 123-131.

It will be proper now to retrace bookvi. our steps a little, and to observe the course pursued CnAF- *\u2022 by the king and the government, in so far as their policy tended to bring on the coming change. Wolsey, the reader has seen, was possessed with Progress of the notion that the tiara might some day rest on his antoTin brow. It is easy to see the course which such a man E\"gland would be disposed to take towards the reformers. Great, in all places, was the talk about Luther and the Lutherans. The works of the Reformer were translated into English almost as soon as published, and found ready purchasers in this country.* The bull issued against him by Leo X. was sent to the king of England. Wolsey, as legate, transmitted it to the bishops. By their lordships, the works of the Saxon monk were pronounced heretical, and prohibited. Many of the Greek literature men, with Tonstal at their head, drew back from the precipice to which they imagined themselves approaching. The doc trine of Luther, said Wolsey, means contempt of the clergy, and as such must be fatal to all virtue. Tonstal had just returned from some very orthodox company in Germany, and said of Luther \u2014 The man is a very Proteus, an atheist; the destruction of to-day pre pares for something worse to-morrow ; nothing sacred will ere long be left \u2014 the hell-dog, and all who have affinity with him, must be crushed, if the church or the world is to retain any good thing. The bull of the pope was followed by a similar instrument from the cardinal. This was in 1521, and the Bucking hamshire inquisition of that year has shown that the voice of the pope and of his legate were not listed up in vain.f On a Sunday in June when congregations would Luther's assemble in greatest numbers to hear high mass, the condemned and pub- licly burnt, * Libros Lutheranos quorum magnus jam numerus pervenerat in manus Anglorum. \u2014 Polyd.

Henry writes against Luther. bull was read in all churches. All persons, it was said, who should be convicted of retaining any writing by Martin Luther, after an interval of fifteen days, would incur the penalty of the greater excommunica tion. The document, which set forth largely the perverse opinions attributed to the German Reformer, was then placed by a notary on the church door, or in the church porch. Crowds collected about it \u2014 one person generally reading the contents for the benefit of the rest. At St. Paul's cathedral an imposing ceremony took place. After a sermon by the bishop of Rochester, the cardinal himself committed the writings of Luther to the flames. But the people do not appear to have been edified by the spectacle. Their sarcasms about the power to destroy books being some thing different from the power to answer them, and about the folly of wise men who could expect to con vince people by burning them, were no secret.* But the cardinal, as if aware that something beside burning books had become needful, now put no less a person than the king upon writing a treatise in* defence of the assailed faith. Wolsey flattered himself, that the high reputation of the king of England in Rome, might probably contribute not a little to his own elevation in that connexion. Under this influence, Henry wrote to the archduke Palatine, urging that no pains should be spared to suppress the growing in subordination ; that Luther and his books should be doomed to perish together, unless he should repent ; at the same time pledging the aid of his own sword to bring about that consummation. Living in the midst of flatteries of all kinds, Henry was ready to believe that he could wield the pen in a royal fashion along with his sceptre. With the help, probably, of more learning than his own, he brought together the con tents of a book in defence of the church, and sent it into the world in the spirit of a man who supposed * Strype's Eccles.

Ordinary men could not move with too Chap' *' much caution in dealing with such an adversary as Luther ; but to look on while the king was the assail ant, was to see the Cerberus of heresy chased back to those lower regions whence he must have come. The book, when completed, was shown to Sir Thomas More. The wary lawyer suggested that the language con cerning the absoluteness of the papal supremacy should be more guarded. It might be cited against the king inconveniently another day. But Henry would not consent to abate an expression, or to soften a word, on that point. The volume was sent to his holiness, through the English ambassador at Rome, with the promise that the sword of the king shoidd be unsheathed to uphold the doctrine asserted in the treatise. The pope, fallen far below the high estate of his predecessors in past centuries, eager to obtain aid from any quarter, received the present with the most studied expressions of favour and admiration ; commending especially, the readiness of the king to cut off the diseased members of the body of Christ by material means. What honourable title should be conferred on his Henry is majesty for services so eminent? Let the designa- \"en'derof6 tion be \u2014 Protector of the Roman Church, said one. the Faitu- Let him be called Apostolic King, said another. But the title voted was, ' Defender of the Faith.' Henry's joy on receiving this mark of distinction is said to have been such as no event in his history had been known to produce. He took his place on the throne ; the cardinal was on his right hand ; the court was about him in its best bravery, and the letter of the pope was read publicly and aloud. This done, the sound of trumpets reverberated through the palace, and heralds proclaimed in Latin \u2014 Henry, by the Grace of God, king of England and of France, Defender of the Faith, and lord os Ireland. The sequel was a grand banquet.* * Strype, Eccles. Mem. i. c. 2. Rymer, vi. 199. Fiddes's Life of Wolsey, 249."], [140, "118 NATIONALISTS AND ROMANISTS. BOOK VI. iHAP z Luther re plies. Persecution in iSzl. Thousands of copies of the king's book were printed at the king's expense, and ten years' indulgence was awarded from the papal exchequer to every one who should read it. Luther read the treatise without dismay, and replied to it so as to show that the pen had not destroyed him, whatever the sword might do. The points discussed by the king, were the efficacy of the sacraments, and the authority of tradition. The essence of the controversy lay there, and great good was done by concentrating the strife upon that issue. If any teaching, said Luther, be opposed to holy scripture, whatever may be its origin \u2014 tradition, custom, kings, Thomists, Sophists, Satan, or even an angel from heaven \u2014 all from whom such teaching proceeds are accursed. Everything true, good, and enduring must come from the scripture; nothing opposed to it can stand. We have seen that the year 1527 was signalized by the capture and plunder of Rome in the name of his Catholic majesty of Spain, and that the outrage perpetrated in the city was horrible. Wolsey never ceased to feel, that in the matter of the papacy, Charles had played him false, and deep was his resentment. The triumph of the emperor, accordingly, in the capital of Christendom, was no welcome news to the cardinal. But the alleged cause of his sorrow \u2014 a sorrow obtruded on the nation in penitential ceremonies, and in in junctions to fast and pray \u2014 was the scandal which had been thus brought upon the church, and upon the Christian name. Fasting, however, was little observed, even by the clergy ; while the laity, it is said, showed ' their grudge against the spiritualtie,' by describing the pope as a ' ruffian,' as out of his place in meddling with temporal dominion, as having begun the mischief himself, and as being only rightly served.* The people were the more disposed to express them selves in this manner, inasmuch as in the spring of this year the diocese of London had been much * Hall's Chron. 727, 728."], [141, "REFORM BEFORE THE REFORMATION PARLIAMENT. 119 BOOK VI Chap. z. agitated by a new search after heretics and heretical books. The Tonstal register shows that the persons brought before the ecclesiastical authorities at this time were made to take the usual oath, binding them to convict themselves, and to become informers against neighbours, friends, and relatives without exception. Some of these unhappy people hesitated so to bind themselves. One of them, William Pykas, steadily refused, and he was sent to the Lollards' tower, to be there ' thrust into the stocks for his manifest and ' manifold contumacy.' But the alternative \u2014 to swear or to burn \u2014 was a terrible one. Even the rack was sometimes threatened in such cases.* The oath was generally taken. Great numbers, especially in London and in Essex, were arrested and examined. The evidence brought against them was often that of their most trusted neighbours and nearest kindred. Mostly they were persons in humble life. But in this instance, as in the previous inquisition in Buckinghamshire, several ecclesiastics were implicated. Mention was made of Sir Sebastian Herries, curate of Kensington ; and of Dr. Forman, rector of All-saints, in the city. The offences of the persons examined consisted in their holding various opinions in common with the Wycliffites and Lutherans ; in their being wont to consort with persons known as holding such opinions ; and in their retaining prohibited books, especially the New Testament in English. The Testament is said to be by ' William Hotchin and Friar Ray.' This means the printed version by Tyndale. So were the ' known' persons sought out, both men and women, in the diocese of London in 1527. The inquisition ex tended over the following year, and courts were held for the examination of suspected persons in Colchester, Walden, and other places. f While the leaven of the new doctrine was thus affecting the common mind of the country, its educated * Foxe, Acts and Mon.

Master Garrett, curate of All-saints, where Dr. Forman, before mentioned, was rector, had jour neyed to Oxford in 1526 to sell prohibited books, and especially Tyndale's Testament. For these wares he found ready purchasers. Great vigilance was exercised by the authorities to detect and punish all attempts of this nature. But the readers of such books, and men who had adopted the new opinions, existed, more or less, in all the colleges and halls of the university, and were in constant communication with each other.* BOOK VI. Ohap z. Progress of the re- formed doc, trine in Oxford. But Cambridge was now to become conspicuous in the movement. We have seen the effect of a study of the Greek Testament on Bilney. He was a man of a delicate organization, and rather timid than cou rageous. But he was deeply conscientious, devout even to asceticism, and intensely solicitous to bring other minds under the religious influences which had given so much freedom to his own spirit. He pos sessed, withal, a ready and winning utterance, and was more skilled than many stronger and greater men in devising means to reach his object. His religious ideas came less from Luther than from Wycliffe, and less from either than from his own thoughtful reading of holy scripture. He did not take exception to tran substantiation, nor to some other points usually dis carded by the class of men with whom his name is commonly associated. His great protest had respect to the lives of the clergy, and to the superstitions and errors especially at variance with the scriptural doc trine concerning forgiveness of sin, and real holiness of life. Through his influence many Cambridge men came to be accounted converted men, and among Luther anism in Cambridge. * Foxe, Acts and Mon.

In 1509 there was a memorable youth in Clare Hall, not more than eighteen years convm of age, who had gained a fellowship. He took his master's degree in 1514. This young scholar was the son of a Leicestershire yeoman, who occupied a farm of no great extent in that county. The good man, we are told, had walk for a hundred sheep, and his wife milked thirty cows. In 1497, at the call of the king, this yeoman had appeared mounted and armed on Blackheath, to resist the Cornish rebels under lord Audley. His son tells us that he never forgot the help he rendered to his sire on that occasion, when only six years old, in assisting to buckle on that armour. The youth had six sisters, who were all brought up in ' godliness,' and settled honourably, their frugal parents giving to each of them a portion. The yeoman's board was hospitable, and from his door the poor and deserving were never sent empty away. The only boy of the family was this Cambridge student. He had been sent early to school, and in due time to the uni versity. He acquitted himself creditably in his studies, both classical and theological; but his force lay in his ex quisite sensibility, the clearness of his conceptions, the vigour of his imagination, and in the readiness, hearti ness, and manifest honesty with which he gave out what was in him. But, with all the ardour of his temperament, he was strongly conservative in his tastes, and, as the result, according to his own account, he became 'as obstinate a papist as any in England.' He learnt that some of the younger mem bers of the university had meetings among themselves for reading the scriptures. When inquiry was made about them, the answer of many was it is only the Sophists. But the son of the Leicestershire yeoman * Foxe, Acts and Man."], [144, "122 NATIONALISTS AND ROMANISTS. BOOK VI. (HAP. Z. accounted those meetings mischievous, and thought the evil should be assailed by something more effectual than a sneer. He one day presented himself in the midst of these readers, and endeavoured to dissuade them from a course so unusual and unauthorized. But, to his surprise, they were not to be so persuaded. His next step was to lay the blame of these irregu larities on Stafford; and his chief reason now for attending the class-room of the professor, is to show his disapproval of much that is said, and to do his best to prejudice the students against their instructor. While in this mood, it happened that he was chosen to preach before the university. The subject of his discourse was, Melancthon and his doctrines, and such was the impression made, that all pronounced him the man above all men to resist the Lutheran heresy, and, under God, to save the church. Bilney had been observant of this man's course, had listened to his famous sermon, admired his zeal, but lamented that it should be so little according to knowledge. The preacher, said Bilney, now bears a strong resemblance to Paul before his conversion ; may he not be brought to resemble him still further ? In the hope of reaching this gifted mind, the good man resolved on a singular expedient. He made his way to the study of the preacher, and there, pale, feeble, and trembling, besought him, for the love of God, to receive from him his confession. The preacher consented, and in this confession Bilney set forth the phases of the spiritual conflict through which he had passed, and the scriptural grounds on which he had found rest and peace. The effect was as the breaking of new light on the mind of the confessor. He became from that time the companion of Bilney in religious studies, and in works of charity, and soon grew up into the same spiritual manhood.* Such was the early history, and such the conversion, * Latimer's Sermons, 334.

Latimer sought forgiveness Chaf' z' from Stafford, attended his lectures in another spirit, Hu?^Iati and valued his friendship. Much now was said about preaching the change which had come over him, and the surprise andlabours that Bilney should have been the man to produce it. Latimer had been a zealous sacramentarian. He now taught that piety, not the imposition of hands, makes the priest ; and that Christian usefulness must come from the influence of Christian truth, and not from a scrupulous observance of ceremonies. These ideas embraced the essence of the Reformation. This was a falling back, not merely on the earlier fathers as distinguished from the later, but on the school of the apostles themselves. Larimer's preaching attracted great crowds. Some, like young Becon, afterwards secretary to archbishop Cranmer, listened devoutly, treasured up his lessons, and became eminently spiritual men. But others, as Becon informs us, were filled to the utmost ' with envy and malice ' against him.' Even of these, however, many who came to mock, remained to admire and to pray. Coupled with this zeal for preaching, was a zeal, scarcely less valuable, which led the preacher to seek intercourse with such as valued his services. Latimer, so effective in the pulpit on Sunday, might be seen during the week in the study of the humblest student, visiting the poor in the most neglected parts of the town, and extending his charitable and spiritual help to the most necessitous inmates of the lazar-house, or to the most abandoned outoasts of the jail. The change, it will be seen, which he had experienced, was not a mere change of opinion. It had given him new feelings, and new motives to action. He had become in heart, and practically, another man.* The great topic with Stafford, and Bilney, and The cam- Latimer, and their whole party, was, the worth and formers are authority of the sacred scriptures.

But so natural does it seem that a church founded professedly on scripture should favour appeals to scripture, that the Cam bridge reformers generally, in common with Wycliffe and the Wycliffites before them, all made such appeals. Their so doing, however, was more to the credit of their simple-mindedness as Christians, than to their acuteness as disputants. To raise the authority of scripture, and the right of private judgment in regard to its meaning, above the authority of the church, was to cease to be Romanists, though they did not appear to see their course in that light. To the more sagacious of their opponents this was sufficiently clear. They saw no distinction between the fall of church authority and the fall of the church. How to show, accordingly, that these appeals to scripture were unwise, unwarranted, and pregnant with the greatest evils, became their great object. The man who took this office upon himself in Cambridge was a certain prior named Buckingham, who insisted, among other things, that the common people, in reading the scriptures, would be sure to understand them in the grossest and most literal sense, and that the greatest mischiefs would follow. The ploughman, for example, reading 'No man, ' having put his hand to the plough, should look ' back,' would soon cease from his labour ; and the woman reading that ' a little leaven leaveneth the ' whole lump,' would use so little as never to make good bread ; while such as read about cutting off the right hand, or plucking out the right eye, might be expected^ to proceed to maim themselves ac cording to the letter of such injunctions ! The pompous and solemn manner in which this nonsense was delivered gave the matter a further air of the ridiculous. BOOK VI. Chap. z. Latimer's encounter with prior Bucking ham.

Great was the crowd ; book vi. and seated, in stately fashion, exactly opposite the CHAF \" pulpit, was prior Buckingham. Latimer did not scruple to tell his hearers, that the real source of all such assaults on the word of God, was the wish of some men to keep the people in subjection, as children, to their authority. But the time had come in which they were to be accounted as of full age, and were to be left to read and judge for themselves. With regard to what had been said about the plough, the leaven, and the right eye, there was no danger of finding the people so devoid of common sense as not to see that these expressions were all figurative. For example, said the preacher, you have sometimes seen the picture of a fox dressed up as a friar, and in the act of preach ing. But who does not know that the design of that picture is not to say that foxes ever preach, but to say \u2014 Beware, lest, under the garb of a preaching friar, you sometimes find a man with the craft and hypo crisy of the fox ? The friar had submitted to some hard thrusts before, but this last was not to be borne. He rose in great excitement, and hastening to the circle of his friends, complained bitterly of the inso lence of these apostles of Lutheranism.* One other incident of this nature should be men- L\u00bb''\u2122r tioned. West, bishop of Ely, had heard much of bishop Latimer, and resolved to hear him preach. But the Ely' preacher was not to be apprised of the bishop's inten tion. When Latimer began to deliver his next ser mon to the clergy, which, as usual on such occasions, was in Latin, the bishop, and several clergymen of his following, entered the church. The preacher ceased from his discourse until his lordship and his friends were seated. He then observed, after a pause, that when the auditory changed, it was fitting that the subject of discourse should also be changed; and leaving the topic he had entered upon, he began to * Gilpin's Life of Latimer."], [148, "126 NATIONALISTS AND ROMANISTS. BOOK VI, Chap. z.

West was not a man to be easily dis concerted. As Latimer left the pulpit, the bishop accosted him, thanked him for his good sermon, and said \u2014 But there is one thing more, master Latimer, for which, if you will do it, I shall be prepared to kiss your foot. What is that thing, my lord? in quired the preacher. Why, said the bishop, that you preach me in this place a sermon against Martin Luther and his doctrine. Latimer replied \u2014 Your lordship knows we are forbidden to read the writings of Luther. I am in no condition therefore to refute them. If his doctrine be in accordance with scrip ture, I have nought to say against it ; if it be con trary to scripture, I am prepared, according to my power, to refute it. His lordship felt that he had gained nothing by this affectation of indifference as to what had passed, and added tartly \u2014 Well, well, I ' perceive you smell somewhat of the frying-pan. ' You will repent this gear some day.' From that time the bishop plotted with the enemies of Latimer, and forbade his preaching in any of the churches in Cambridge, or in his diocese.* But discourse about Latimer was not confined to Cambridge, nor to the diocese of Ely. Unfavourable re ports had reached the ear of the cardinal, and the preacher was required to appear before him at York Place, his residence. At the appointed hour Lati mer knocks at that palace gate, and is shown into an ante-room. Presently a small bell rings, which is the signal that persons in waiting may enter.

' It is, assuredly,' was the reply. The cardinal appeared to be favourably im pressed by the presence of the person before him, and said : ' From what I see, you should be a man ca ' pable of conducting yourself soberly and wisely, yet ' it is reported to me that you are much infected with ' the new-fangled doctrine of Luther, and such like ' heretics, and that you do very much harm among ' the youth, and other light people, by your preaeh ' ing.' Your grace, said Latimer, has been mis informed. I have studied in my time both fathers and schoolmen, and should know better than to afford warrant for such imputations. That is well spoken, said the cardinal : I am glad you can so say ; and calling to a Dr. Capon and a Dr. Mar shall, who were within hearing, he bid them test Master Latimer by some scholastic questions. It soon became manifest that Latimer was better qualified than the doctors to take upon him the office of cate chist. The cardinal was much pleased. He knew not why a man so well grounded in the knowledge proper to his office should have been brought before him ; and turning round, he said : ' I pray thee, ' Latimer, tell me the cause why the bishop of Ely, ' and others, do mislike thy preachings?' Latimer described the scene at Cambridge, when he preached about the office of a bishop, and added, ' from that ' day his lordship hath done his best to silence me.' Wolsey requested him to give the substance of that sermon. Latimer tells us that he did so with fidelity, leaving the issue to Him who has all hearts in his hands. ' And that is all you said ?' subjoined the cardinal. ' That is all,' was the reply. Whereupon, after a little further questioning, his grace said : ' If ' the bishop of Ely cannot abide such doctrine as you ' have here repeated, you shall have my licence, and ' shall preach it to his beard, let him say what he ' will.' Latimer was thus made independent of the"], [150, "128 NATIONALISTS AND ROMANISTS. BOOK VI. Chap. z. Proceedings against Barnes. bishops, and could preach throughout all England. Very honourable to Wolsey was this proceeding \u2014 and for that reason, among others, it is not here passed over.* The next Cambridge delinquent to appear before the cardinal was not so fortunate as Latimer. This was Dr. Robert Barnes, prior of the abbey of the Augustinians in that town. Barnes was a native of Norfolk, had studied at Louvain, and on his return to Cambridge distinguished himself by his lectures on Terence and Cicero. With his passion for the resto ration of letters, he joined considerable zeal in favour of the new religious opinions. But on this latter subject his light was partial. Bilney attempted, and not wholly without success, to show him the way more perfectly. When the bishop of Ely had silenced Latimer, Barnes invited him to the abbey pulpit, which, as an ' exempt' foundation, was not under the bishop's jurisdiction \u2014 and the church overflowed. Barnes was disposed to imitate Latimer, but he wanted the simple-mindedness, the serious conviction, and, above all, the natural sagacity, of his model. In the course of this excitement at Cambridge, a day was fixed on which a special movement should be made in defence of the new doctrine. But the sermon by Barnes touched little on doctrine. It teemed with invective against the manners of the clergy, and with descriptions which all men saw were intended to be pictures of the Cardinal. Report of these things was made to Wolsey. Two of his officials arrested the prior, in the presence of his friends, in the convocation house.f Barnes was not equal to the trial which had befallen him. During his journey to London, he was at one time bold and elevated, at another timid and prostrate. When conducted from his place of confinement to the * Strype, Eccles.

After nightfall he was \u20ac\"AP \"' summoned. He dropped, as was customary with men who approached his eminence, on his knee. Wolsey inquired of his attendants \u2014 Is this the Doctor Barnes who is accused of heresy? Answer being given in the affirmative, the cardinal turned towards the ac cused man, still kneeling, and said \u2014 So, Master Doctor, you have not sufficient matter wherewith to teach people in the scriptures but you must take sore offence at my pole-axes, my pillars, my golden cushions, my crosses, and hold them up as a laugh ing-stock to the people. A merry and scornful meeting you had of it that day. Verily it was a sermon more fit to be preached on a stage than in a pulpit. And at last you spoke of my wearing red gloves \u2014 or, as I should say, quoth you, bloody gloves. What say you to this, Master Doctor? The poor man, thus assailed, answered wisely and unwisely, courageously and timidly, by turns. In the end, he was told that he must clear himself from the charge of heresy by the sort of testimony which he declared it impossible to produce, or be burnt. The next day a paper was submitted to him by the chapter, with the injunction \u2014 Abjure in these exact words, or prepare to be burnt alive. The struggle in the soul of the unhappy man was great. I will die, he said, rather than abjure. Nevertheless, old friends among his judges so plied him with sophistries and terrors, that their end was accomplished \u2014 he consented to dis- honour the cause he had espoused by a recantation.* On the morning of a day soon after, there was a great Barnes and stir in the neighbourhood of St. Paul's. The whole yard men at city seemed to be in motion in that direction. By st Fau eight o'clock, Barnes, and five ' Stillyard men' \u2014 ship- masters or merchants of the Hanse Towns \u2014 were con- ducted, with a strong guard, and great following, from * Foxe, y. 416 et seq.

The crime of the foreigners was that they had brought copies of the New Testament into this country. All were clothed in penitential dresses. One of the Stillyard men was sentenced to bear a lighted taper of five pounds weight. On the summit of the steps before the cathedral, a platform had been constructed, where Wolsey appeared in his scarlet and gems, and with the other insignia of which Barnes had spoken with so little reverence. Six-and-thirty ecclesiastics of high rank were in attendance, consisting of bishops, abbots, and priors, besides a number of doctors, who shone on that day in their damask and satin. On the platform was a temporary pulpit. Before it the penitents were required to kneel, while Fisher, the bishop of Rochester, dis- coursed to them on the enormity of their sin, and on the tender mercies of the church which had consented to receive them back to her bosom. At the close of the sermon the cardinal mounted his mule. His attendants bore the usual magnificent canopy over him, and he proceeded in this manner to his palace. Meanwhile, Barnes and his companions are made to walk three times round a fire kindled outside the eastern gate of the church, casting the faggots they bore, into the flames, as they encompassed them. So the pomp of authority was expected to prove stronger is*?, than the new ideas and the new life which were fast taking possession of many of the wisest and the best.* Garret and We have seen the great precaution which was to be T^tamett taken to seize the Tyndale New Testaments on their reaching our shores.

The bales of books were safely landed, and lodged in the house of Thomas Garret, curate of Allhallows, in Honey-lane, near Cheapside. Garret was one of many in his time, who, though naturally timid, were to show that conscience, which is said to make bad men cowards, can make weak men strong. He was a zealous preacher of the Lutheran doctrine of justification by faith, and went so far as to affirm that every layman capable of preach ing that great truth should preach it. It soon became known that he had the New Testament in English for sale. Purchasers were found in great numbers. Thus, in less than ten years after the New Testament in Greek is found in the hands of our scholars, the New Testament in English is found in the hands ot the people. Tradesmen, artisans, students, and even priests and monks, were eager to possess it. That so many should have evinced this feeling, at so much hazard, is evidence that a sense of religious want had grown up in the heart of multitudes. To such, the scriptures were as waters to a thirsty soil. The words of Christ and of Paul were viewed as full of authority \u2014 as an end of all controversy. The religion exhibited in their teaching was felt to be a genial, a happy religion. It revealed the Fatherhood of the Almighty, full of love and pity. Few in the present day can imagine with what freshness and power this new and living word came upon the spirits of the men and women of those times. Garret had studied at Oxford. He judged, as before Garret and stated, that the English Testament would be a wel- lament come book to many a young heart in that university. *\u00bb o*f\u00b0r(1- With the assistance of his friend, Anthony Dalaber, a student of St. Alban's hall, he made the experiment, and with signal success.

The fact was, that, by this time, Wolsey had become aware that the advice of Cochl\u00e6us had not been acted upon effectually. The books which should have been seized and destroyed were passing into wide circula tion. It was discovered that Garret had been the instrument of this mischief, and that Garret was gone to Oxford. His place of concealment was in the house of a man named Radley ; but it had become known. Radley was a singer at Christchurch. Christchurch, too, the college founded by the cardinal himself, had become the centre of Garret's operations. Wolsey had introduced a number of Cambridge men into his new college. Among these were several who had become deeply interested in the new learning, and were already looked upon with suspicion. Frith was one of these, and Clarke, Su inner, and Taverner were all active men of the same character. Private meetings took place at Christchurch for the reading and exposition of the scriptures, to which many from other colleges were admitted. The men of this association spoke of each other as 'brethren,' and their influence became more considerable every day. Disappointed and mortified by reports of these pro ceedings, Wolsey had now resolved that Oxford should be purged. Those who had been employed in selling the prohibited books, and those who had bought them, were alike in danger. Some of the brethren met for consultation. It was agreed that care should be taken to conceal the obnoxious books ; and Dalaber was to send Garret away with all speed, giving him a letter of introduction to his brother, the rector of Stalbridge in Dorset, who was in want of a curate. But Dalaber himself describes his brother in Dorset as a ' rank papist.' Garret was expected to present himself to this man under a feigned name, and, as the"], [155, "REFORM BEFORE THE REFORMATION PARLIAMENT. 133 only probable condition of finding a home at Stalbridge, book vl was to affect to be himself a zealous Romanist. Garret C\"AF z' fled, but in deep distress. To go forward was to do violence to his conscience \u2014 to return to Oxford would be to place himself in the path of the lion. Through the first day, and part of the second, he was in doubt what course to take. His final decision was, that he would not seek concealment on such terms. His face was again set towards Oxford. He flattered himself that he was prepared for all consequences. It was evening when he re-entered the city, and making his way with much caution to his former lodgings, he went exhausted to his bed. Before midnight the Arrest of proctors were at his door, who led him at once to Lincoln college, where he was given in charge to Dr. Cottisford, the commissary of the university. Great was the joy over this event. News was sent with all haste to the cardinal. On the day of Garret's departure, Dalaber, ponder ing over the gloom of the times, felt inclined to relinquish his divinity studies, and to commence the study of law. With this view he left his rooms at St. Alban's hall, and tookrooms in Gloucester college, which then stood where Worcester college now stands. This was on the Thursday. On Friday, and the fore noon of Saturday, he was much busied in giving a little order to his bedroom and his books. Having accomplished this object, he sat down, and began to Hidden life, read Francis Lambert on St. Luke. But presently he was disturbed by a loud and repeated knocking at his door. On at length opening the door, he there saw Master Garret, who at once said, I am undone \u2014 they have taken me. This he said in the presence of a young man, one Garret's of the college servants, who immediately slipped escape' down stairs. Dalaber marked the sudden disappear ance of the servant, and said, Alas ! Master Garret, by so speaking in the hearing of that youth, ' you have ' disclosed yourself, and undone me.' Garret then re-"], [156, "134 NATIONALISTS AND ROMANISTS. BOOK VI Chap. z. Dalaber's troubles. lated what had happened to him, adding, that while the commissary and his family were at prayers, he had contrived to slip the bolt, and so to escape ; and, without heeding his friend's complaint of his impru dence, ' He prayed me,' says Dalaber, ' with deep sighs ' and many tears, to help to convey him away ; and ' so casting off his hood and gown wherein he came to ' me, and desired me to give him a coat with sleeves, ' if I had any ; and he told me he would go into ' Wales, and thence convey himself, if he might, into ' Germany. Then I put on him a sleeved coat of ' mine. He would also have had another manner of ' cap from me, but I had none but priest-like, such as ' his own was.' The two friends then knelt together in prayer, embraced, bedewed the face of each other with their tears, and were so affected that utterance almost failed them. Garret became once more a fugitive. Dalaber renewed his devotions, and soon went forth to apprise his friends in different colleges of what had hap pened. He then went to the chapel at Christchurch. Evening song had commenced. The dean and the canons were there in their mass dress. Dalaber stood in the door of the choir, listening to his friend Ta vern er playing the organ, and to voices with which his own had often joined when his heart was less bur dened with care. As he there stood, Dr. Cottisford, the commissary, entered the chapel in great haste, looking 'pale as ashes.' He hurried to where the dean was. Earnest words passed between them. As both were leaving, Dr. London, rector of Lincoln, met them in a state of still greater excitement, and Cottis ford was seen to weep as they upbraided him with his negligence. Dalaber left the chapel with Clarke, who saw the cloud gathering, and gave him ' a very godly ' exhortation.' He slept that night with his old friends, and in his own room, in St. Alban's hall. It was a stormy night out of doors that night, as well as within. Dalaber was afoot by five in the morning. The gates of Gloucester college should"], [157, "REFORM BEFORE THE REFORMATION PARLIAMENT. 135 have been open at that hour. He found them closed, book vr. Not until he had paced the road beneath its walls Ckaf '' nearly two hours in the damp and cold morning air did he gain admission.

But one brave resolve he had made \u2014 come what would, the enemy should learn nothing from him touching his brethren that might be used to their injury. On attempting to open the door of his room, he found that the lock was not as he had left it. He succeeded, however, after awhile, in making an entrance. Within he found everything in confusion \u2014 clothes, bedding, furniture, tossed in all directions, and so left. While looking in dismay on this scene, a monk came, and informed him that the commissary and two proctors had been there last night in search of Garret, and had thrust swords and bills through the bed, and other parts of the room, in the hope of finding him. The monk added, that the commissary had ordered that Dalaber, on his return, should appear immediately before the prior, and in the bewilderment of the mo ment the poor youth went, bespattered as he was with his long walking, to the prior's chamber. Where did you sleep last night ? was the first ques- Daiaber be tion. At St. Alban's hall, with my friend Fitzjames, J\u00ab\u00a3\u00bb was the answer. The prior showed that he did not credit this statement. Was not Master Garret with you yesterday ? He was, said Dalaber. Where is he now? ' I do not know, unless he has gone to Wood ' stock ; he told me that he would go there, because ' one of the keepers had promised him a piece of ' venison to make merry with at Shrovetide.' Dalaber power ot himself tells us that this was an untruth. The reader \u00b0fd\u2122 will see that its intention was to save the life of an r^\u00a3s\u00b0 innocent man, by putting the bloodhounds on a wrong scent.

It is of the nature of tyranny that it should thus affect moral conception and feeling. The guilt of those who err thus is small, compared with the guilt of those who may be said to necessitate such error. This prior of Gloucester college was a sample of too large a class \u2014 very orthodox, but very covetous, and devoid of principle. In this interview with Dalaber, he observed that the young man wore what appeared to be a valuable ring. Let me see that ring, said the prior. Dalaber presented it. The prior placed it on his hand, and said, with a sinister smile \u2014 This must be my property, for it has my initials \u2014 A for Anthony, and D for Dunstan. Poor Dalaber had so much to fear just now, that the loss of his ring affected him little. BOOK VI, Chap. z. Prior Dun stan's mo rality. At this point of the dialogue several officials made their appearance, requiring the prior and Dalaber to repair immediately to Lincoln. On entering the chapel, says Dalaber, ' I found Dr. Cottisford, com 'missary; Dr. Higdon, dean of Cardinal's college; ' and Dr. London, warden of New college, standing ' together at the altar. They called for chairs, and ' sate down, and then for me to come to them They ' then asked me what my name was, how long I had ' been at the university, what I studied, and various ' other inquiries : the clerk of the university mean ' while bringing pens, ink, and paper, and arranging ' a table with a few loose boards upon trestles.' These preliminaries settled, Dalaber was required to swear upon the mass-book that he would answer truly all questions put to him. This he was at length pre vailed upon to do, ' partly by fair words, and partly ' by threats.' But it was not his intention, he tells us, to be so bound by this oath as to convict himself, or to injure his friends. To the question, where is ' Master Garret?' he answered, as before, that he knew not, unless he was gone to Woodstock. * Surely, ' they said, they might see, by my foul shoes and dirty ' hosen, that I had travelled with him the most part of Dalaber before the authorities"], [159, "REFORM BEFORE THE REFORMATION PARLIAMENT. 137 BOOK VI Chap. 2. The confeS' sor's lot. ' the night. I answered plainly that I lay at Alban's ' hall with Mr. Fitzjames, and that I had good witness ' thereof. They asked me where I was at evensong, ' I told them at Frideswide, and that I saw first ' Master Commissary, and then Master Doctor London, ' come thither to Master Dean. Doctor London and ' the dean threatened me that if I would not tell the ' truth I should surely be sent to the Tower of London, ' and there be racked, and put into Little-ease.' Finding that nothing further could be learnt by questioning Dalaber, the commissary and his friends led him to an upper chamber, placed him in stocks, with his feet nearly as high as his head, and having made fast the door, left him to his thoughts. ' When ' they were all gone,' he writes, ' then came into my ' remembrance the worthy forewarning and godly de ' claration of that most constant martyr of God, Master ' John Clarke, who, well nigh two years before that, ' when I did earnestly desire him to grant me to be ' his scholar, said unto me after this sort : Dalaber, ' you desire you wot not what, and that which you ' are, I fear, unable to take upon you : for, though now ' my preaching be sweet and pleasant to you, because ' there is no persecution laid on you for it, yet the ' time will come, and that, peradventure, shortly, if ' ye continue to live godly therein, that God will lay ' on you the cross of persecution, to try you whether ' you can as pure gold abide the fire.

Then will ye wish ye had never known this ' doctrine ; then will ye curse Clarke, and wish that ' you had never known him, because he has brought ' you to all these troubles.

In this respect, as in others, the account which Dalaber has given us presents a genuine picture of the times. The exact and minute painting to which his simple-heart edness, and his intense interest in his story disposed him, gives us more than a picture of life as it then was \u2014 we see the reality. The strength and weakness in the character of these men, come out as we find them in the human nature about us, and as we can suppose them to have been. We have stopped the longer to watch this chase after heresy in Oxford, partly because this account of it bears such an impress of genuineness, and partly because what was thus taking place in that city, may be accepted as a fair sample of what was common at that time to a great part of the kingdom. Unfortunately, Dalaber's narrative ends with the Sunday morning incarceration, and the meditation above described. But we learn something more con cerning his fate, and that of the ' little flock so lately ' born in Oxford,' from other sources. On the evening of that Sunday, or on the morning following, Dalaber was again examined. His confession in regard to * Foxe, v. 43 I et seq."], [161, "REFORM BEFORE THE REFORMATION PARLIAMENT. 139 himself was free, and must, as he knew, expose bookvi. him to grave consequences. But in regard to any- Chaf 2i thing that might implicate others, he was ' marvel lous obstinate.' After this examination, he was removed from the great chamber at Lincoln, and sent to prison. Search was made without delay in the rooms of all search for suspected persons. Large stores of Testaments, and chapter other books, were found, Dalaber's among the rest, Garret notwithstanding the ' marvellous secrecy' with which they had been concealed. Many persons were put under arrest, and a report of these things, sounding very like a despatch concerning some great victory, was sent to the cardinal. But a great drawback remained. Garret had not been taken. Orders were sent to all the ports, in the hope of seizing the arch culprit, should he attempt to leave the kingdom. Strange to say, so intense was the solicitude of the Oxford doctors on this matter, that they consulted a great wizard of the time for information, and by so doing exposed themselves to the penalties of heresy in their attempts to crush it. ' He fled in a tawny ' coat, south-eastward, and is in the middle of London,' was the answer of the wizard. His grace the arch bishop, and his eminence the cardinal, were apprised that the oracle had so spoken ! But, as usual, the oracle had lied. Garret had gone in the direction of Bristol. The hue and cry raised upon his track had been enough to shake the nerves of a much stronger man. Had he carried with him a colony of plagues, the stir to apprehend him, and to prevent infection, could hardly have been greater. And what had he done ? He had presumed to sell the New Testament to his countrymen in their mother tongue ! He was at length apprehended at Bedminster, a village on the Somersetshire side of the Avon, near Bristol. He was sent from that place to Ilchester jail, and by special writ to London. AVolsey prevailed on him to make certain confessions and promises, and he was spared"], [162, "140 NATIONALISTS AND ROMANISTS. book vi. for a season. But some years later, the good man HAr \"-' became again obedient to his convictions, and on that occasion met his martyr-death in a martyr-spirit.* Further Meanwhile, the suspected in Oxford, consisting, ac- cording to the language of one of their persecutors, of \"aris tht ' the most towardly young men' in the university, were accused. pUt upon their trial. They were menaced with severe penalties. Clarke would probably have been burnt, had he not died under the cruelties of his imprisonment.* Three of his companions \u2014 Sumner, Bayley, and Good- man \u2014 were reported to be near death from the same cause. Their friends at length obtained permission to remove them from their foul prisons to their college rooms. They were borne on litters. But it was too late. No attention could save them. They were re- moved to die. So the life of three of these ' most ' towardly young men' was nipped in its budding. Of the remainder, some made a sort of recantation, and were sentenced to carry the faggot in Oxford, as Barnes and the Stillyard men had carried it in London. Among these sufferers were several who became men of some figure in after time. Such was Cox, who became bishop of Ely ; Udal, who became master of Westminster and Eton schools ; Salisbury, afterwards dean of Norwich \u2022 Frith, who became a martyr ; and Ferrar, who became bishop and martyr, f Luther Hitherto, Henry had left the cardinal and the Henry\u2014 bishops to deal with heresy pretty much according to cutLn?rse their judgment. It was in 1526 that Luther wrote a letter to the king of England, in which he congratu- lated his majesty on the rumour of his having become favourable to the gospel. Henry's indignation was extreme. The crowned head which had taken up the pen to refute this apostate monk numbered among his converts ! The king published a reply to this letter, in which he cautioned his subjects against un- faithful translations of the New Testament, set forth, * Foxe, iv. 6 1 j. f Froude's Hist. Eng. ii. 61 et seq."], [163, "REFORM BEFORE THE REFORMATION PARLIAMENT. 141 said his majesty, as pure wine, but which would be book vi. found to be mixed with poison.* The bishops pro- Chap\" *' fessed the sincerest sympathy with the feeling of their sovereign on this occasion. Wareham issued a man date against all books containing 'any particle' of the New Testament, f An attempt was made also to move the authorities of Antwerp to prosecute Eynd hoven, the well-known printer of such works in that city. But the attempt was not successful. The law of that city had not provided any penalty for such print ing, and the pleasure of the king of England could not be allowed to come into the place of law. So did the revival of religion tend towards general liberty. } During this excitement Latimer and Bilney were Latimer summoned before the cardinal, and cautioned against preaching Lutheran doctrine. Both professed that they were little concerned about what Luther taught, but that they were deeply solicitous that their teaching should be in all things according to the scriptures. In this same year, Bilney and his friend Arthur preaching traversed the country as preachers. Great was the andArthur. excitement wherever they came. The people listened with delight. Priests tore them from the pulpit. \u00a7 But early in 1527 grave proceedings were instituted against them. The choice set before them was to abjure or to burn. Arthur was persuaded to recant. Bilney came thrice before his judges ; thrice he refused to abjure, and stood prepared to abide the result. But Tonstal, bishop of London, to whom Bilney had written the eloquent letters from his prison which are still extant, was anxious if possible to save him. Sentence was, in consequence, postponed from day to day, and this policy was successful. The man who had resisted all the terror at the command of his * Strype, Mem. i. 91, 92.

Bilney carried the faggot to St. Paul's, as Barnes had done. The Catholics were full of exultation. The Protestants wept with a pious sorrow. But light was their grief compared with the death-struggle which seemed to take possession of the soul of Bilney him self as he returned to his prison.* Bilney, however, like Garret and many more, was to find in his troubles the elevating power necessary to prepare him for the crown of martyrdom. During the space from 1527 to 1532, edition after edition of the English Testament, each more portable, and with better apparatus than the former, was landed, under various concealments, in this country. Some were pur chased abroad by our clergy, purely that they might be destroyed. Others were seized as soon as imported, and burnt. But the greater number escaped detection. Everywhere men and women were found eager to become purchasers. Tyndale was indefatigable. - When reminded that the priests would very likely burn the works he was at so much pains to call into existence, the reply of the martyr was \u2014 Should it be so, they will only do to my books as they will some day do to myself. But the brave man was ingenious in eluding the search of his pursuers. He moved from place to place. Now he availed himself of protection from the powerful, and now he found his home in quarters the most humble and obscure. With the assistance of Frith, he commenced a translation of the Old Testament. Miles Coverdale also became possessed with the idea of giving himself to the same kind of labour. It was manifest, on all hands, that the checks opposed to this new tide of affairs were giving way. Every day the waters seemed to rise higher and higher. f What a * Foxe, iv. 633-638.

E trospect happy land is this, said Master Roper to his father in-law, Sir Thomas More, in which heresy is so watched and so rigorously dealt with. ' And yet, son Roper,' rejoined Sir Thomas, ' I pray God that some of us, as ' high as we seem to sit upon the mountains, treading ' heretics under our feet like ants, live not the day ' that we should gladly be at league and composition ' with them, to let them have their churches quietly ' to themselves, so that they would be content to let ' us have ours quietly to ourselves.'* Writing to Cochl\u00e6us, Sir Thomas More laments that Germany was producing monsters daily, more to be dreaded than any to be found in Africa. Nor was this infamy peculiar to Germans. Numbers of Englishmen, he writes, who, a few years since, would not hear mention of the name of Luther, have grown to be full of his praises. Heretics, becoming bold with numbers, ' have put off hypocrisy and put on impudence.' So did the natural progress of learning, intelligence, and wealth in England, and the success of the reformed doctrine upon the continent, contribute, under the pro vidence of God, to bring the mind of many in this country under the influence of Protestant thought be fore Henry VIII. and his parliament began the work of reformation. It was not always given to the good men so influenced to see the extent to which consist ency required them to go in the course to which they had committed themselves. As we have seen, when Latimer and his contemporaries affirmed, as Wycliffe and his followers had affirmed before them, that the scripture, and the scripture alone, must be the guide of their personal teaching, they appear not to have seen how completely they had elevated private judg ment into the place of church authority. Having gone so far in opposing church doctrines, it behoved them to go much further.

Z cum stances, that its power to look into the future should be thus limited. The issue in the distance is disclosed by little and little, as men are able to bear it. It is not too much to say, that before the meeting of the memorable parliament of 1529, a very large portion, and certainly the most intelligent portion, of the people of England, especially in towns, were full of Protestant sentiment. But it was for the most part an unconscious Protestantism, such as not a few possessing it were by no means prepared to avow under that name. It is thus, however, that all great revolutions are brought about. Men learn to do by degrees what they would never have dared to do at once. As these revelations of the future open upon them, some are seen to draw back in dismay. But others feel, that what they are called to do to-day, is as clearly their duty as the thing they did yesterday, and they go forward."], [167, "CHAPTER III. THE REFORMATION PARLIAMENT. ISZ9. WITHIN a fortnight from the day on which Wolsey book vi. ceased to be chancellor, England witnessed two CHAP ' ;' ereat events \u2014 the formation of a cabinet consisting: The'new almost wholly of laymen, the first of its kind in our sept. history ; and the assembling of a parliament prepared to express the long pent-up feeling of the nation on many subjects, but especially on questions affecting the pretensions of the see of Rome, and the position of the national clergy. The new privy council con sisted of the duke of Norfolk, as president, Sir Thomas More, as chancellor, the duke of Suffolk, the earl of Wiltshire, Sir William Fitzwilliam, and Dr. Stephen Gardiner. Gardiner acted as secretary to the king, and was the only ecclesiastic in the cabinet. Such a ministry was a sign of the times. The great divisions of party which had been long Division ot visible in English history were now to become more fhepast\" than ever conspicuous, and were so to remain for some time to come. In the fourteenth century, England had her extreme Romanist party, consisting mainly of the clergy and their dependents, and represented by such men as Courtney and Arundel. It had like wise its great national party, whose policy was avowed by such noblemen as John of Gaunt, by his friend earl Percy, and by the Lollard members, as they were called, in the lower house in the time of Richard II. It had also its opponents of the church of Rome, who, like Wycliffe and Oldcastle, added dissent from the doctrines of the hierarchy, to dissent from its polity II L"], [168, "146 NATIONALISTS AND ROMANISTS. BOOK VI Chap. 3. Old party distinctions revived, and become more pro minent. and customs. During the fifteenth century these lines of demarcation became at times so faint as to be hardly observable, but they were never wholly effaced. Since the death of Henry VII., every year had ; served to revive these old distinctions, and to bring them into prominence. Wareham, archbishop of Can- terbury ; Fox, bishop of Winchester ; Fisher, bishop of Rochester ; Sir Thomas More, Wolsey, and Henry himself down to the year 1529, were among the most strenuous upholders of the ecclesiastical system of Europe in the form substantially which had been given to it in past ages. But of late, the men who had learnt to look with much discontent on the conduct of the papacy, and on the wealth and power of our own clergy, had become greatly more numerous, and out- spoken beyond precedent in their censures. In pro- spect of the meeting of parliament in 1529, noble lords, and leading men, of this class, discoursed in their homes, and elsewhere, with the greatest freedom con- cerning the revolution in this respect which was about to take place.* It was concluded that there was hardly any conceivable diminution of church authority, or of the wealth of churchmen, which the great ma- jority of the nation would not be found prepared to approve. This party, the national party, whose aim was to secure the national authority, and the national wealth, against all undue meddling on the part of the papacy, was the great party of the time. It was so possibly from its numbers, it was so certainly from the position and influence of its leaders. The only fear on the part of this class of reformers had respect to the king. No other influence could prevent their policy from being largely carried out ; and the danger to be apprehended was, that to win the assistance of the king to the side of religious independence and re- form, concessions might be made to the crown which would trench on the general liberty of the subject. * Legrand, iii. 374."], [169, "147 THE REFORMATION PARLIAMENT. The great want was freedom from ecclesiastical dorai- book vi nation : and from the feeling of the hour, scarcely any C\"AP' '' price would be deemed too great to be paid for that object. The men opposed to the papal ascendancy on the more religious grounds, and who were to become the nucleus of a real reformation, would be sure to sustain decided measures, and while not few in number, would compensate for their want of rank and wealth, by the depth of their convictions, and the activity to which they were prompted by their zeal. The re sistance to be expected from a few aged bishops, and from sympathizers who were regarded as being for the most part not less feeble, caused no apprehension. Nor were these views exaggerations. Such, or very nearly such, was the state of parties ; and the king, who was to do so much towards originating the English Reformation, was to be for his lifetime its great helper and its great hindrance. On the day when Wolsey \u2014 disgraced and stripped Popular of office \u2014 -descended to his barge by his private stairs T%\"s\\ ,',',' at the Blackfriars, more than a thousand boats, filled \\v* \u00a3\" of with men and women, were seen floating about on the Thames, waiting for his appearance. It had been . noised in the city, that an end had come to the great ness of the cardinal ; that he would be sent by water to the Tower ; and this multitude had come suddenly together to rejoice at the sight. The feeling of London in this respect was the feeling of all the great towns, and of the most intelligent and manly portion of the nation almost everywhere. Whence came this feeling ? It came from the conviction that the removal of Wolsey was the removal of the grand stay to an enor mous system of abuses, both in church and state, i Eng-lishmen have sometimes exulted thus over the fallen.

Some of it he condemned, and wished to see removed. But his plans of reformation never passed beyond good intention ; and the lawless ness in the state, and the corruptions in the church, which were virtually sanctioned and upheld by him, were such as readily to account for the strength of the popular feeling now manifested.* The practice of raising money from one seven years to another without consent of parliament was his deed. The war with Spain, so costly, so disastrous, and so ruinous to trade, was his war. The church system, which had become an omnipresent inquisition, from which no fireside, especially among the lower and middle classes, could be said to be safe, was his system \u2014 the system which he had especially bound himself to vindicate and sustain. The temporal peers in the Reformation Parliament were forty-four in number. The abbots were more numerous than the bishops. Altogether, forty-six spiritual persons were present. These forty-six votes would have sufficed, in ordinary times, to have checked any material inroad on the pretensions of the church. But the men possessing these votes knew that the court, the country, the laity in the lower house, and many in the upper house, were against them. Their power, accordingly, was more apparent than real. The dangers with which their personal interests were beset, disqualified them for acting with firmness, according to their real or professed sense of public duty. Nor should it be forgotten, that the majority of the bishops and abbots owed their preferment to the favour of the present king, and some hesitation * In 1523, Fox, the aged bishop of Winchester, wrote a long letter to Wolsey, urging him most earnestly to prosecute the measures for reform ing the manners of the clergy, which then occupied his thoughts. But the hand of the cardinal was scarcely the hand to be employed in such a work. It came to nothing. \u2014 -Strype's Eccles. Mem. i. 72\u201474."], [171, "THE REFORMATION PARLIAMENT. 149 BOOK VI Chap. 3. might have been felt about using a power against the sovereign which had been received openly from his hands. With regard to the lay peers, seven years had intervened since the dissolution of the last parliament, and twenty-five temporal lords now took their seats for the first time. Henry VII. was jealous of his nobles, and did what he could to depress them. His son adopted a more generous and a wiser policy. The instances in which the conduct of Henry VIII. towards the great families was harsh or selfish, were exceptional, not common. It is true, great men knew that his favour was the one avenue to rank and wealth. But they do not appear to have regarded their circumstances in this respect as involving any great hardship. Many of these younger peers had been wards to the king, and so must have been accus tomed to defer to his pleasure. On the whole, the lay peerage was too small a body, and too nearly con nected with the crown, not to be open to considerable influence from that quarter. The house of commons was much more numerous. It consisted of two hun dred and ninety- eight members \u2014 -a number much too great to be subject more than partially to court ma nagement. It is known, indeed, that neither Henry nor his nobles felt any scruple about using their in fluence to secure the return of the right men at elec tions. But at this juncture, the court and the con stituencies were so well agreed, that meddling of that sort could hardly have been necessary anywhere. There was, it seems, a number of men in the house who came to be known by the name of the king's servants, and who were always at hand when a divi sion was to take place on any important matter. But this is a description which can hardly be supposed to have been applicable to the greater part of the mem bers. On the whole, while we do not attribute to the Reformation Parliament an unsullied purity, nor a patriotism wholly free from self-interest \u2014 as little do we regard it as being the mere tool of an arbitrary"], [172, "150 NATIONALISTS AND ROMANISTS. book vi and corrupt policy. Not a little of its work was Cbap- *\" honestly done \u2014 done because it was believed, in the circumstances, to be the right thing to do. If the tyranny of the crown was somewhat too readily sub- mitted to, it was because it promised to be a compa- rative refuge from the less endurable tyranny of the church. spiritual The form of priestly power which grew up in Eu tsumedi0by r\u00b0pe in the Middle Age was more Oriental than the clergy.' European. The jurisdiction and authority of the Christian clergy greatly exceeded anything of that nature assigned to the ministers of religion by the races of the west while in their state of heathenism. Among the Greeks and Romans, the function of the priest was a harmless affair. Such was very much the case with the Teutonic race. The Celts were somewhat more submissive to priestly rule, but ceased to be so when influenced in only a slight degree by the progress of civilization. But it was otherwise with the position of the Christian priesthood. Ac cording to the canon law, the churchman was almost as much magistrate as priest. He had to do with marriages, with wills, and with many other secular matters, and he was the judge concerning all offences' charged upon men of his own order. On the ground, moreover, that the moral is inseparable from the reli gious, there was not a relation in life, nor a duty of it, with which the priest did not presume to intermeddle, and to subject to his special scheme of rewards and punishments. The law of the magistrate was con cerned with the outward acts of men in their social connexions. It went no further. But the canon law took cognizance of sins \u2014 offences which might per tain to mind only, and be wholly secret and personal. At the same time, by means of the confessional, what ever of this nature might be hid, was required to be made known : and as all sin was a sort of taxable com modity, the multiplication of sins was in fact an aug mentation both of revenue and of power. There was a"], [173, "151 THE REFORMATION PARLIAMENT. time when the Christian communities of the Roman book vi. empire did wisely in ceding arbitrative powers of this HAF' 3' nature to their ministers ; and when the conscience of the Christian might naturally look for relief to the intelligence and piety of the Christian pastor. Chris tians felt, for a season, that even their civil interests were safer in such hands than in the hands of the magistrate, the magistrate being often an avowed, or a secret, ' heathen man.' But that time passed away, and, as often happens, the machinery survived, when the spirit indispensable to its wise action was no longer present. In the days of Wolsey the proceedings of these indepen consistory courts, as they were called, filled the coun- mTgutrau'6 try with irritation, which at times broke out into f'aim,ed b* . -. \u2022 r* -i clergy. open violence. What made the action of these courts against the real or alleged sins of the people especially offensive, was the fact, that the clergy themselves were not only one of the most delinquent classes of society \u2014 but that, being judges in their own cause, the penalties imposed by them on each other were so light, in comparison with those often imposed on the laity for the same offences, as to present a mockery of discipline. Men who acted as officers for these courts, were driven out of the houses they entered, hooted, and knocked down in the street. To this pass had the popular feeling come, when the citizens and bur gesses of England were called upon to send men to parliament who should find a remedy for such evils. Henry professed to recognise liberty of speech in the commons as an ancient right. It would not have been favourable to his object to have acted on any other principle towards the new parliament. For awhile, the lower house evinced an admirable mix ture of courage and discretion in the use of its freedom.

But they complain also of the uncharitable behaviour of ' divers ' ordinaries' in attempting to correct such disorders ; and they then proceed to show to his majesty, that ' the causes which daily breedeth and nourisheth ' these factions,' are to be found in the clergy who are so forward to complain of them. Your clergy, they say, enact all sorts of laws in con vocation, which neither the laity nor your majesty have had anything to do with making, and which they en force by their own fines and penalties, invading therein your majesty's prerogative, and doing great wrong to your loyal subjects. In the court of Arches there is a limited number of proctors, who, between them, can occasion much needless delay and cost, the fines at every stage of proceedings there being enormous, and the whole being managed by the said proctors so as to be to their advantage. Especially have the poorer sort of your majesty's subjects a right to com plain, summoned, as they often are, before official persons on slight, imaginary, and malicious grounds ; and being grievously harassed for little or no cause, are only released by paying fines much beyond their means. Often, too, the clergy obstinately refuse to administer the sacraments, even to the sick, unless paid for so doing. . In all matters testamentary the same system of extortion is carried out, the judges, scribes, apparitors, summoners, appraisers, \u2014 all ex pecting their separate gratuity or fee. Exactions of the same description are made from all persons presented to benefices. At the same time, the prelates, who are responsible for all these proceedings,"], [175, "153 THE REFORMATION PARLIAMENT. BOOK VI Chap. 3. do not scruple to give the livings at their disposal 'to certain young folks, calling them their nephews ' or kinsfolks,' retaining the proceeds of such livings in their own hands until their ' infants' shall come of age to be inducted. Great is the number of holi days, the effect of which is a great waste of time, great viciousness, and ' very small devotion.' The men who favour this idleness and vice are the men who summon your majesty's liege subjects on the charge of heresy, often purely from their own pleasure, compelling them to answer all questions put to them ; who conduct such examinations privately, in place of doing so in open court ; and who often send men to their prisons without examination at all, and presume to detain them there six or even twelve months, with out allowing them to know who has been their accuser, or of what they have been accused. Nor can such persons when released obtain any redress for such false imprisonment, however afflicting or ruinous it may have been to them. ' Also, upon the examina ' tion of the said accusation, if heresy be ordinarily ' laid unto the charge of the parties so accused, then ' the said ordinaries or their ministers are wont to put ' to them such subtle interrogatories concerning the ' high mysteries of our faith as are able quickly to ' entrap a simple, unlearned, or yet a well-witted lay ' man without learning, and bring them by such sinister ' introductions soon to their own confusion. And ' further, if there chance any heresy to be by such ' subtle policy, by any person confessed in words, and ' yet never committed, neither in thought nor deed, ' then put they without further favour the said person ' either to make his purgation, and so thereby to lose ' his honesty and credence for ever ; or else, as [with] ' some simple silly soul, the same person may stand 'precisely to the testimony of his own well-known ' conscience, rather than confess his innocent truth in ' that behalf and so be utterly destroyed. And if ' it fortune the said party so accused to deny the"], [176, "154 NATIONALISTS AND ROMANISTS. BOOK VI, Chap. 3. Ki-plyofthe bfehops 'said accusation, and to put his adversaries to prove ' the same as being untrue, forged, and imagined ' against him, then for the most part such witnesses ' as are brought forth for the same, be they but two in 'number, never so sore defamed, of little truth or ' credence, they shall be allowed and enabled, only by ' discretion of the said ordinaries, their commissaries ' or substitutes ; and therefore sufficient cause be found ' to proceed to judgment, to deliver the party so ac ' cused either to the secular hands, after abjuration (to ' be burnt) without remedy ; or afore, if he submit 'himself, as best happeneth, he shall have to make ' his purgation and bear a faggot, to his extreme shame ' and undoing.'* From whatever quarter the inspiration of this address may have come, from the king, from the country, from the honest seeling of the parliament, or, which is most probable, from all these sources together, the words spoken were just and noble words. Henry at once took measures to convert some of the most important sections of this petition into statutes. The document itself he handed to the bishops, as the parties whom it chiefly concerned, and their lordships set forth a formal reply without delay. In regard to certain of the abuses mentioned, it was deemed enough to say, that if some of their order were unhappily so much at fault in respect to them, the same could not be said of all. In regard to the court of Arches, it was alleged that improvement had taken place there ; but it was not added, that the alleged improvements were inconsiderable, and that, such as they were, they were of very recent origin, and had not come until forced into existence by external influence. In short, the bishops were pre pared to vindicate themselves in respect to nearly everything that had been urged against them. They * Foxe, iv. 610, 61 1. Petition of the Commons, MS. Rolls Office. Froude, i. 190-199."], [177, "155 THE REFORMATION PARLIAMENT. were not, for instance, to be censured for promoting book vi. their young ' nephews' or ' infants' \u2014 which meant, Chaf 3' possibly, in not a few cases, their own children \u2014 to the cure of souls, if the revenues of the livings so appropriated were applied to the education of the young people, or to charitable uses. Nor could they for a moment admit that the laws passed in convoca tion should be dependent for validity on the sanction of the civil power. It might be true that the statutes of the realm and the canons of the church were not always in harmony ; but the remedy in that case was, that the state should conform itself to the church, not the church to the state. Concerning imprisonments for heresy, their lordships merely affirm that they do not proceed thus against persons without suspicion of pravity of that kind ; and inasmuch as the persons who have thus come into their hands have been apostate friars and priests, bankrupt merchants, and such like people, they declare themselves unable to see any reason for the sort of complaint that has been made. And in regard to the custom of receiving evidence in cases of heresy from persons without character, their lordships affirm it to be the law of Christendom, that the worst evidence against persons so accused should be accounted as sufficient, when no better can be obtained.* As we read this language, we feel as though the The church. o o o men do not deluge had intervened between the better days of the seethesigns Plantagenets and the days of the Tudors. Nearly all osthe,im\u00ab that had been done in those early times to subordinate the ecclesiastical to the civil power seems to have been swept away. But the case was not so. During the last forty years England had known little of civil strife. Churchmen had been in favour and in power. As the supposed friends of order, they had been allowed to become wealthy, arrogant, and encroacliing. They * Strype's Annals, i. 198-210. MS. Bolls Office.

While such, however, was the tendency of things in the region occupied by ecclesiastics, another stream of feeling had set in strongly among influential laymen. The people also had become more wealthy, and with the increase of wealth had come an increase of intelli gence, of independence, and of an indisposition to sub mit to this growing priestly rule. Ecclesiastics are naturally conservative, especially if well stricken in years, and the leading bishops of 1529 were mostly old men. So far from seeing into the future, it was not given them to read the present. In the manner of such men, they concluded that what had existed long must continue to exist. They flattered themselves that they had only to persist in declaring heresy to be but another name for treason and anarchy, and the civil sword would be sure to be with them. The commons sent several bills to the upper house in accordance with their petition to the king. In these bills they reduced and defined the fees to be paid for the probates of wills and the interment of the dead ; they declared it to be a mischief and a scandal that spiritual men should take upon them secular offices ; they condemned pluralities, except within certain limi tations ; they aimed to put an end to non-residence ; and they provided that no prelate nor pope should grant a dispensation from the observance of these laws under heavy penalties.* The bishops and their friends sounded the usual note of alarm. To touch anything pertaining to the established church, was to endanger everything. They did not see, that times will come in which to cede nothing is to save nothing. Fisher, bishop of Rochester, now seventy-six years of age, spoke in behalf of his brethren in the upper house, and said \u2014 ' My lords, beware of yourselves and your country ; * Herbert, 136-138. Foxe, iv. 612, 61 4."], [179, "THE REFORMATION PARLIAMENT. 157 ' beware of your holy mother the Catholic church ; the book vi.

Wherefore, ' my lords, I will tell you plainly what I think, that ' except ye resist manfully, by your authorities, this ' violent heap of mischief offered by the commons, you ' shall see all obedience first drawn from the clergy, ' and secondly from yourselves ; and if you search into ' the true causes of all these mischiefs which reign amongst ' them, you will find that they all arise through want ' of faith!* Protracted and sharp discussions ensued. The Dispute be- -^ t ween ill prelates would make no surrender. They took their bishops and stand on prescriptive right. The lawyers, on the ' e awyers other side, appear to have spoken freely, at times offen sively, in dealing with such rights. One of them said \u2014 ' The usage has ever been for thieves to rob on ' Shooter's hill, ergo it is lawful.' The prelates grew angry \u2014 Is it come to this, then, that we are to be com pared to highwaymen and thieves ! But the speaker stood to his terms, and said to the archbishop of Can terbury \u2014 The exactions which your order are wont to make from the people, and which these bills require you to make no more, are ' open robbery and theft.

J Sir Thomas Audley, speaker of the house, and about thirty leading sFi^ce\u00a3s members, presented themselves to the king in his palace at Westminster, where they set forth that the shires, cities, and boroughs of England, had chosen them as men who might be trusted to watch over the public interest ; but that the bishop of Rochester had * Earl.

The new statesman. presumed to describe them to the upper house as men lacking the faith of Christians, degrading them to the level of Turks and infidels, and leaving no more au thority to their acts than might be due to the acts of such men. Their prayer was, that the king would summon the said bishop before him, and oblige him ' to speak more discreetly of such a number of men as ' is the commons' house.' Henry called Fisher, and six other prelates, to his presence. When made aware of the complaint of the commons, the courage of Fisher failed him. He descended to equivocation. When he spoke of men as wanting in faith, he spoke of the Bohemians, not of the house of commons. The six bishops concurred in this explanation. It was ac cepted by Henry and by the commons ; but the men who could avail themselves of such means of escape from their difficulty fell irretrievably in so doing.* The English clergy, in common with their order every where, had aimed at more than was their own, and, for a season, we shall see them obliged to content them selves with less than is their due. In what remains of English history, the ministers of religion will generally retain the reverence due to their office, but in public affairs they will not be again the men they have been.

In his youth this man had fallen under the discipline of a father-in-law, and leaving a home little congenial to him, had be come an adventurer in search of a livelihood. He determined to seek his fortune out of England, and appears to have filled some humble office in a mer cantile house in Antwerp. We next find him in Florence, where he is reduced to great straits. It happened one day, that ' a poor young man' presented himself to a banker named Frescobaldi, a name known in London hardly less than in Florence, and entreated 'alms for God's sake.' The banker looked on the ' ragged stripling,' and pleased with what he saw, or thought he saw in him, inquired \u2014 ' Where were you ' born ?' ' I am,' quoth he, ' of England, and my name ' is Thomas Cromwell. I am strayed from my country, ' and am now come into Italy with the camp of ' Frenchmen who were overthrown at Garigliano, ' where I was the page to a footman, carrying after ' him his pike and burganet.' The Italian had com passion on the young Englishman, took him into his house, and, after awhile, furnished him with a horse and means wherewith to return to his country.* It would seem that during some portion of his early Cromw.ii life Cromwell visited Rome, for he is said to have \u2122 committed the Latin translation of the New Testa ment by Erasmus to memory on his way thither. But the report which makes him to have been in the imperial army when it sacked that city, is not to be accepted. That event belongs to the spring of 1527, and Cromwell had entered the service of Wolsey in in the 1525, and seems to have been in the service of the woiTy\u00b0 marchioness of Dorset some time before. f But such * Foxe, v. 392. t Ellis's Letters, 1st Series, i. 218, 219. 3rd Series, ii. 99-113."], [182, "160 NATIONALISTS AND ROMANISTS. BOOK VI. Chap. 3. Faithful to his master. lie aspires to the func tion of a statesman was the rude training of the man whose mind was to give an impress to the future of his country beyond that of any other man of his time. Cromwell soon rose so high in Wolsey's estimation as to become his secretary, and to be entrusted with the delicate task of suppressing the smaller monasteries in favour of the cardinal's new colleges. No man could have performed that piece of service without bringing evil tongues upon him ; and Cromwell did not escape that kind of penalty. But he was on the whole faithful to his master, and stood by him when he was deserted by men on whom his bounty had conferred far greater obligation. He accompanied Wolsey to his wretched home at Esher, and ministered to his comfort there to the best of his ability. Cromwell seems to have despaired of seeing Wolsey restored. He appears, also, to have felt \u2014 as with his transcendent capacity he might well feel \u2014 that there was no man to take the place of the cardinal, still less to do that new and strange work which Wolsey himself would never have been the man to do, though he certainly had done much to make the doing of it a necessity. His mind was full of such thoughts, in that gloomy house at Esher, on the morning of a gloomy autumn day, 'when it chanced me,' says Cavendish, ' to come into the great chamber, to give ' attendance, where I found master Cromwell, leaning ' in the great window, with a primer in his hand, ' saying of our Lady matins.

' Thus much,' said he, book vi. ' will I say to you, that I intend, God willing, this C\"AF \" ' afternoon, when my lord hath dined, to ride to ' London, and so to the court, where I will either make ' or mar, ere I come again.' In the afternoon Crom well had a long secret conference with Wolsey. What that conference embraced no one knows. But Crom well took horse, and rode to London, through the heaviest rain that had fallen for a year past.* \u25a0With some difficultv the future statesman obtained Cromweiit interview access to the king. It is supposed, that in this private with Henry, interview, the man who had been seen some years since as ' a ragged stripling,' begging his bread in the streets of Florence, ventured to urge on the king of England that he should declare his dominions free from all foreign control whatsoever, whether civil or ecclesiastical ; that he should assert this independence by committing the question of his divorce and his second marriage to the decision of authorities within his own realm ; and that he should proclaim himself head of the church as truly as of the state. That words with this bold meaning were uttered, and that Henry was disposed to look upon the advice, and upon the man who had shown himself man enough to offer it, with favour, may be safely believed. The king had become perplexed. He scarcely saw the course best to be taken. But in Cromwell there was no lack of clear apprehension, or of the strong will. His mind seems to have come as the needed light, and the needed force, on the mind of the king. So far, he meddled not with doctrinal differences. He affected no sympathy with Lutheranism. But in clear and strong terms he laid out the course which would not only suffice to free the king from his present embar rassment, but would furnish a basis for other great national reforms ; and Henry appears to have felt that he had found the instrument necessary to ensure suc- * Cavendish, 258-270.

Becomes a member of parliament \u2014 his ser vices to Wolsey. cess to a policy of this bold description, should he decide to act upon it. Having obtained the confidence of the king, Crom well's next step was to induce a junior member of the house of commons to resign his seat in his favour. He was thus in a position to serve the cardinal by opposing the articles of impeachment which had been preferred against him. This he did with so much ability, that the impeachment came to nothing ; and he at once ' grew ' into such estimation in every man's opinion, for his ' honest behaviour in his master's cause, that he was ' esteemed a most faithful servant, and was of all men ' greatly commended.'* It is to be presumed that Henry himself was not unwilling to see the action of the parliament on this case so terminated. Cromwell became secretary to the king, which gave him a seat in the privy council. An authorfty to which we do not attach great value has described him as a disciple of Machiavel, and as recommending the study of that author to all men who would become real statesmen, f His Italian experience had probably brought him into some acquaintance with the works of that pro found writer ; but the authority which describes him as having committed the New Testament to memory, is quite as trustworthy as that which makes him to have been a pupil in the school of so exceptionable a master. Such a man might have seen something to admire in the writings of the great Italian politician, without adopting all his apparent maxims. Cromwell, in common with all men of his order, knew his own capacity for business, and was bent on being occupied in the kind of work for which that capacity gave him fitness. This ambition, if such it may be called, is all but inseparable from natures so gifted. The power to achieve great things, and the passion to achieve thern, are commonly born together. The mind of Cromwell is the mind of the Reformation Parliament. * Cavendish, 276. t Reginald Pole."], [185, "THE REFORMATION PARLIAMENT. 163 But it is time we should look somewhat more closely book vi. to the character of another person whose name will be Chaf 3' for ever associated with the great religious revolution Vise of Anne in our history. Anne Boleyn was the daughter of Boleyn. Sir Thomas Boleyn, of Rochford Hall, in Essex, and of Blickling, near Aylsham, in Norfolk. The grand father of Sir Thomas had been knighted as mayor of London. His father, Sir William, had fought by the side of the earl of Surrey at Bosworth, and that noble man subsequently gave one of his daughters, Elizabeth Howard, in marriage to Sir William's eldest son. Elizabeth Howard became the mother of Anne Boleyn, and Anne Boleyn was thus related in blood to one of the first families in the kingdom. Her father, Sir , Thomas Boleyn, was a man of unquestionable ability, and much occupied in diplomatic and state affairs.* When the princess Mary went to Paris to become Annes res the queen of Louis XII., Anne Boleyn, whose exact p^.\u2122 age at that time is doubtful, accompanied her as one of her attendants. Louis, as we have seen, died soon after the marriage, and his widow returned to Eng land ; but Anne Boleyn remained in France as one of the household of Claude, the new queen. f Claude, though young, was a person of so much intelligence, virtue, and religious worth, that she was known by the name of the ' good queen.' It was beneath such oversight that Anne Boleyn passed the next nine years of her life. Claude died in 1524, and then the young Englishwoman became a part of the household of the famous duchess of Alencon, sister to Francis, and afterwards queen of Navarre. The duchess, as the reader has seen, was distinguished by her beauty, her accomplishments, and her love of letters; and was viewed with disaffection by not a few on account of her religious life, and her known disposition to favour the Lutherans.

It may be doubted if the French court was really more depraved at that time than some others ; and we feel sure, that it would have been hard to find another where the daughter of a gentle- man would have been, on the whole, in circumstances more favourable to character than were those in which Anne Boleyn passed her early years.* Had her conduct been open to any grave censure at that time, would she have remained so long near the person of the ' good queen ?' Would the intelligent and pious isz7. duchess of Alencon have become so readily her friend?

All these acquisi- book vi tions contributed to render a person of great beauty C\"AF' 3' eminently attractive. That such a woman, now in the flower of her youth, conn ru should have admirers was inevitable ; and it would mours' have been strange if the court gossip in relation to her had never verged upon court scandal. Cavendish relates a story which seems to show that a love affair had taken place between her and the young lord Percy, son of the earl of Northumberland; but we do not know that any pledge or contract had passed between them. That nobleman declared more than once, and upon oath, that nothing of that nature had existed. In fact, lord Percy was engaged at the time, or soon after wards, to the lady whom he married. Sir Thomas Wyatt, the poet, appears to have been charmed by the person and manners of the court beauty, and was, perhaps, allowed to demean himself more freely in her presence, from his being a married man, than would otherwise have been tolerated. But the character of Anne Boleyn is not affected by anything known to have happened in that intercourse.* Such had been the history of this lady to the time Umry \u00b0> when Henry declared himself to her as her lover, passion to Anne supposed, as she well might, that the king's in- tension in so addressing her was to secure her as amis- Aus- \"*7 tress, and she is described as expressing herself with the feeling of a high-born and virtuous woman.

When some thing more in accordance with his wishes reached him, it was in a form which bespoke the apprehensions that had been the cause of this hesitancy, and which even then had not wholly passed away. Anne sent him a picture, in which a female was seen alone in a vessel, the ship being in great danger from a storm. Henry was greatly delighted with this present, and with the ' sweet words' of the letter which accompanied it. ' Henceforth,' he writes, ' my heart shall be devoted ' to you alone.'* All thought of a match for the king from any con tinental court had now died away. The divorce ques tion was publicly broached. The pope was said to have promised his sanction of that measure. Perhaps Anne Boleyn might be excused in concluding that the moral propriety of the divorce, and of her own marriage with Henry, had been thus placed beyond doubt. Such was the common faith in the dispensing power of the pope in those times. To such a woman, more over, at such an age, the prospect of a crown may be supposed to have been inexpressibly fascinating. She may also have persuaded herself that the future tran quillity, and, it may be, the future religion of the country, would be much influenced by a course of affairs so unexpected to herself, and so startling to the world. But when all possible allowance has been made in her favour, we feel bound to regard the conduct of Anne towards Catherine as inconsistent with pure womanly feeling, or with high principle.

Her acceptance of such CnAP ]: overtures from the king, in such circumstances, is the first known fault in the history of Anne Boleyn. It was a grave one, and it was natural that it should be followed by others. As the autumn of 1528 wore away, the high and absolute resistance to the king's wishes presented by Catherine, the limit of the powers found to have been entrusted to Campeggio, and the attempt to revoke the case from London to Rome, appear to have satisfied Henry that it became him to abandon all half measures. He now avowed his intention to raise Henr>' Anne Boleyn to the place of queen. Orders were intention to given to prepare apartments for her residence at Soieyif h.T Greenwich. Catherine and Anne were thus placed ?aefnr\\\"-,c under the same roof, and had their respective follow- Greenwich. ing as in the sight of each other. The coarse cruelty of this proceeding needs no comment. The king in proposing such an arrangement, and Anne in accept ing it, were alike at fault. We now return to proceedings in parliament.

That the government should have deemed it safe to adopt such a course towards the whole body of the English clergy, and that the clergy should have deemed it prudent to submit to what was done, are facts which reveal the magnitude of the ec- clesiastical revolution which had already taken place. The clergy, who through so many centuries had divided the empire of the state with the laity, often taking precedence of them, have evidently so fallen as to have become a class of men with whom almost any sort of liberty might be taken. The houses of convo- cation consented to pay 118,000/. in compensation for their delinquency-; \u2014 a sum equivalent to a million, according to the present value of money. It was deemed a politic proceeding to bring the ecclesiastical power down to this lower level ; and a righteous pro- ceeding to do something towards diminishing its enormous and often ill-gotten wealth j and the plea from the case of Wolsey sufficed for this double pur- pose. The measure, in its outward pretence and form, was a shameless wrong ; according to its spirit and intention, it was part of a wholesome policy.* The ung But even this was not the worst. The clergy were preme head not only required to confess their sin, and to pay the churcV money, they were called upon to do so on the ground that the king ' is the sole supreme head of the church ' and clergy of England.' This was a demand which no previous law had made. The clergy entreated earnestly, and repeatedly, that they might be spared the necessity of adopting this language. The govern- ment insisted on retaining it. The bill passed the two houses of convocation with the obnoxious words, but with an additional clause, which said that they * 100,000/. was accepted from the province of Canterbury, l8,oooZ. subsequently from the province of York : the whole to be paid in instalments in the course of the next five years. \u2014 Strype, Eccles.

Chaf 3' Such limitation must always be understood, though in this instance it was no doubt intended to be of special latitude, according to circumstances. What did the government intend by the use of this language ? It is certain they did not use it as de noting a separation of the church of England from the church of Rome in the Protestant sense. But it is observable, that according to the manner in which English laymen had now come to regard the papacy, there was scarcely any restraint that could be laid on the papal authority in relation to national churches , that might not be deemed compatible with the pre servation of Catholic unity. Happily for England, the see of Rome was not prepared to accept allegiance on such terms. The pope, while shorn of almost every attribute which his predecessors had been wont to value, was expected to be submissive, and to be the pope still. How far it was reasonable to calculate on such submission from the spiritual head of Christen dom was a question which hardly seems to have been raised. With Henry and his parliament, resistance and non-resistance seemed to be regarded as questions for others ; the great question with themselves was simply \u2014 What is proper to be done ? Great, in this respect, was the change from the past to the present. In what was now done, intimation was given both to the English clergy and the pontiff, touching the length to which affairs were likely to proceed, should the court of Rome continue to be indifferent to the wishes of Henry and his subjects on the question of the divorce. But when the two houses of convocation had voted Discontent that the money demanded should be paid, the great clergy nT' difficulty remained.

Let the burden fall, therefore, on those who have been most in fault, and who are best able to bear it. Dr. Stokesley, the bishop of London, was apprised of the storm thus rising. It will be remembered that Wolsey had hoped to extort a benevolence from the citizens of the metropolis by dealing with them, not in their corporate strength, but separately and personally. Stokesley resolved to try the same experiment upon the clergy, but it was with no better issue. The clergy of London were summoned to the Chapter House of St. Paul's. Orders were given that not more than six or eight should be admitted at a time. But the crowd of curates and parochial incumbents outside became clamorous, de manded admission, and, after several noisy efforts, succeeded in forcing open the door. All then rushed into the episcopal presence like an insurrection mob. One of the clergy had struck the bishop's servant out of the way at the entrance, giving him a blow in the face. Other officials were roughly handled, and thrust aside ; and a number of citizens had mingled with the men in orders, encouraging them in these riotous doings. It was long before silence could be obtained. At length, the bishop, who is described as a man of wit and learning, but as wanting in discretion and in hu manity, proceeded to remind the angry multitude be fore him that they were men and not angels ; that they had all sinned so as to have forfeited everything they possessed to the king ; and that, inasmuch as his majesty had been graciously pleased to accept of apart of their means in place of seizing the whole, he hoped that, like reasonable persons, they would contribute cheerfully according to their ability. But the malconr tents were sharp in their answers, and the meeting was dissolved. * * Hall, 783, 784. Sir Thomas More sent ten of the clergy, and some half-dozen laymen to prison for that day's proceedings."], [193, "THE REFORMATION PARLIAMENT. 171 The feeling of the lower clergy in London was no book vr. doubt the feeling of the same class of men through Chap' ]' the country. The scene at St. Paul's would be so interpreted. It was clear that the ecclesiastical house in England had come to be a house divided against itself. Men saw that the time had arrived in which it would be safe to attempt such alterations and repairs in the edifice as time and the elements had rendered necessary. The parliament on its meeting in January, I53'-2, appears to have felt that such was its position in relation to the church. The reader has seen, that it was a great principle in The c,cr-v the policy of the Middle-Age clergy, to account eccle- ject to the siastics as amenable in no case, in the first instance, j\u21221. fj\",e.r' to the. tribunal of the magistrate. It was not pre tended that clergymen offending against society should go unpunished ; but it was insisted that it should be left to men of their own order to determine their guilt, and the course to be taken towards them. In no case were they to be subject to penalty from the hands of a layman until divested of their sacred office by a priest. Could we ensure to the ministers of religion the sanctity proper to their vocation, even such an immunity might be safely and wisely granted. It was only on the assumption that the men were in general thus pure that such a law could ever have become preva lent. But, in the times now under review, the character of the clergy was not commonly of that high order, and the law which had been designed to ensure protec tion to the innocent, now often gave a dangerous licence to the guilty. Possessed of such means of impunity, the crimes of the clergy became scandalous, enormous. Much had been done, from time to time, by the civil power to curb this mischief, but with only temporary or partial effect. Experience, said the parliament, has taught us, that all hope of amendment in this respect, as to come from the clergy themselves, must end in disappointment. It is observable, however, that, reso lute as these senators were in the work of reformation,"], [194, "172 NATIONALISTS AND ROMANISTS. they leave archdeacons, and all ecclesiastics above that rank, at liberty to plead this benefit of clergy, deeming it enough for the present, to provide that all clerks below that degree should be subject to the civil magistrate, in all civil matters, in common with the laity.* Something more was done in this session towards diminishing the grievances inflicted on the king's subjects by the spiritual courts. With this view, it was enacted that in future, persons should not be cited to appear in any such court beyond the diocese in which they may be resident, nor be made to pay more than such moderate fines as should be fixed by law.f In another statute, provision was made against certain devices by which the clergy contrived to evade the statute of mortmain. For this object, it was declared that property bequeathed by the dying to secure masses for the soul, should not be so appropriated beyond the space of twenty years. J But the most significant measures of this juncture had respect to the payment of annates, and to the legislative power claimed by the clergy. The annates, or first-fruits, consisted of the first year's value of a bishopric or benefice, required from every man at the time of his promotion to it. This claim had been made by the popes in the first instance in support of the crusades, and subsequently for the general pur poses of their government. Even the clergy in con vocation rose against this exaction, and went so far as to pray the king ' to ordain in this present parliament ' that the obedience of the people be withdrawn from the ' see of Rome,' if this practice be not discontinued. The parliament was not disposed to take this extreme course. The commons would have left it with the BOOK VI. Chap. 3. Further re form of the bishops' courts. Movement concerning annates. * 23 Hen.

But in C\"AP !' 1533, an act was passed which put an end to that im post, and to appeals to the see of Rome under any pretence whatsoever.* With regard to the legislative power of the clergy, The clergy we might have supposed, that with some recent events legislative in their memory, the prelates would have seen it to power' be anything but prudent to take high ground on that subject. But memorials were presented, both to the king and the commons, in which the power to enact laws concerning faith and manners, wholly irrespec tive of state authority, was claimed as belonging to the sacred order by divine right. The answer to these pretensions was, a demand of immediate and entire submission to the supremacy of the crown. The memorialists strove hard to avoid an absolute sur render. But a statute was passed which reduced the clergy to the state of allegiance proper to all good subjects, t Such was the work of the Reformation Parliament Retrospect. in little more than two years from the time of its being convened. It had swept away a vast amount of abuse chargeable on the clergy of the English church, * Strype, Eccles. Mem. i. Ap. No. 41. 25 Hen. VIII. cap. 20. f 24 Hen. VIII. capp. 12,19.

It had put an end to the old and bitter controversy concerning the relation of the ministers of religion to the civil power. It had de clared that the clergy should no longer be allowed to make laws on their own authority. It had made them subject in all things to the laws of the king. It had gone far beyond the premunire statutes of former times in dealing with the pretensions of the church of Rome towards the church of England. Henceforth, according to the language of the new statutes, no con tribution was to be made to the coffers of that see ; no appeal was to be made to its authority. Englishmen were to know nothing of authority, civil or ecclesias tical, above that of the king, or apart from it. The crown was proclaimed as supreme and exclusive in all causes. There is something in this high-handed Erastianism that does not seem natural. We can hardly forbear thinking that judgment concerning what is religious truth, or religious duty, would be more in place in the hands of the ministers of religion, than in the hands of ministers of state ; and that the administrations of religion rest more consistently with ecclesiastical per sons, than with secular functionaries. But these pro ceedings on the part of the English parliament have their explanation in the circumstances and spirit of the times. Had the clergy been truly spiritual men, administering purely spiritual laws, in relation to a people who had become voluntarily subject to those laws, nothing could have been more unwarrantable than any intrusion of the secular power into their affairs. But the laws of the clergy had been made, under one pretext and another, to affect the secular interests of men as much as their spiritual interests. While professing to be only spiritual rulers, they had been wont to claim the aid of the magistrate to assist them in accumulating and preserving their large wealth, and in rendering them formidable as func-"], [197, "THE REFORMATION PARLIAMENT. 175 BOOK VI Chap. 3. tionaries, by enabling them to inflict penalties, not on the soul merely, but on body and goods. It had seemed to them fitting to bring the civil power in this manner into the province of religion, and they had now to meet the consequences of having so done. The alien force which had been called to their help had become their master. And very justly so. It be came secular men to be watchful over the secular in terests of those subject to their authority. Body and goods belong to the domain of the magistrate, and in all attempts to meddle with the one or the other, on the part of the clergy, it was simply just that they should be powerless apart from the magis trate. But thoughts of this nature had no place among thinkers of the times under consideration. The ma gistrate never doubted that it became him, as such, to concern himself with religion ; and the clergyman never doubted that it became him, as such, to seek assistance from the secular arm in the exercise of his spiritual office. This Erastian claim of the state was a natural reaction against the Theocratic claim of the church. The clergy had accounted themselves an order of men divinely appointed to church offices, and they claimed the nation as the church which they were to govern ; and now the nation, through its representatives, seemed to see the meaning and drift of this doctrine. We discover at length, they seem to say, whence the mischiefs so rife everywhere about us have come \u2014 we, the church, should have been the makers of law, and you, the officers of the church, should have been simply its administrators. This was the order of things at first ; it was' strictly reasonable ; it should never have been departed from ; we return to it. It was in vain that the clergy alleged the au thority of their priesthood as being theocratic \u2014 that it had come from God, not from man, and that it was not therefore to be subject to the laws of man. That was a conception which had wrought too much evil,"], [198, "176 NATIONALISTS AND ROMANISTS. BOOK VI Chap. 3. Sir Thomas More. and was much too refined and metaphysical in its nature, to avail against the stern, practical, self-reliant temper of society with which it now had to contend. In fact, both parties were in error. It no more per tained to the two houses of parliament to concern themselves with the cure of souls, than it pertained to the clergy to meddle with questions touching body or goods. The nation was not a church, as assumed by parliament ; and the ministers of religion were not a magistracy, as assumed by the clergy. The two had become usurpers, and it was natural they should be in conflict. The best mode of combining the two func tions, the statesman and the churchman, so as to occa sion the least possible infraction of the principles of social justice, can hardly be said to have been a question of that age, and is still a problem only in course of solution.* The above observations will apply to nearly all the disputes between religious parties in our history under the Tudors. Each party was too much inclined to appeal to force ; and no party, in consequence, had a right to complain when that means of discipline hap pened to be wielded against itself. This fault was more conspicuous in some connexions than in others, but it existed everywhere \u2014 at least until late in the reign of Elizabeth. When Sir Thomas More became chancellor in place of Wolsey, it might have been expected that the rule of a layman, and of a layman distinguished by such culture and acquisitions, would be much more liberal than that of the priest. But strange contradictions met in the character of this eminent person. He was learned, and deficient in learning. Wise, and greatly wanting in wisdom. Humane and cruel. Religious, * In the preamble to the act against appeals there is a sort of reco\u00b0-ni tion of the clergy as the 'spiritualty' of the realm, by the side of the laity as the ' temporalty ;' but the authority left to this spiritualty is merely that of interpretation and administration in regard to spiritual laws, corresponding with the same power as vested in magistrates in regard to secular laws. \u2014 Statutes at Large, ii. 177."], [199, "THE REFORMATION PARLIAMKNT. 177 VI . 3. and disposed to raise external forms and ecclesiastical booi organizations into the place of religion. He could CH1 grow eloquent as the champion of free speech and free action, and could become the zealous patron of almost every form of oppression opposed to such freedom. He could write tender poetry in elegant Latin, and could use that language as a vehicle of the most start ling invective and misrepresentation. In Christianity as expounded by general councils in times much less enlightened than his own, he was a firm believer. Of the earliest and the purest Christianity he knew little. Rome had represented the Deity as making the benefits of an infinite redemption dependent on a due conformity to the mint and cumin of church institutes and rituals ; and the littleness of man, as thus ascribed to the dis pensations of the Infinite, Sir Thomas More could also ascribe to Him. The mission of the medi\u00e6val hierarchy was from God ; the sacraments in the hands of its priests were from God ; and there was no other gate to the celestial paradise. All separatists from the church of Rome, accordingly, were bad men \u2014 rebels, not only against man, but against God. Their own souls were assuredly lost, and all the souls se duced by them were assuredly lost. They were destroyers of men, net merely of their bodies, but of their spiritual nature, inflicting on that an everlasting death.* We may marvel that such a man should have been a believer in such a theory ; but the theory once admitted, heretical people naturally became to him little better than so many incarnations of the Evil One. More never looked on the case of such persons with any approach towards candour. Towards such of fenders, to be pitiless was to be humane \u2014 to burn their bodies was the highest act of charity that could be rendered to their souls. Now, let it not be said, or seem to be said, that seeing Sir Thomas More believed thus, it became him * Dialogues on Heresies. Foxe, iv. 705. More's Life of More, 211. II N"], [200, "178 NATIONALISTS AND ROMANISTS. BOOK VI. Chap. 3. to act thus. His sin had its root in his so believing In a sense, his sincerity was his crime. The Thugs of India say, all men are as selfish as we are. If they do not all rob and strangle as we do, it is simply because they want the skill and the courage. They are, in fact, more selfish in abstaining from our ways, than we are in fol lowing them. Does this reasoning justify the Thugs ? We think not. But the plea that persecution becomes venial when a man's principles naturally lead to it, is to the same effect. The crime of such men is in having such principles. It is folly not to see that a j>rinciple must be fallacious which aims to do what it cannot do ; and it is a crime not to see that a principle must be evil which affects to benefit human nature by trampling upon its natural rights. Men may claim toleration so long as their thoughts are merely thoughts, and their words are only fair words. But if, after the manner of Sir Thomas More, they must pro ceed to unsheath the sword in support of their argu ments, it is only fitting that they should perish by the sword. If there be any opinion which it would be just to punish as a crime, it is the opinion which makes it to be a virtue not to tolerate opinion. It is not necessary, as a current paradox on this subject seems to assume, that we should ignore religion and become atheists, if we would be consistently tolerant. It is only necessary that we should account the affairs of religion as belonging to the administration of a kingdom which is not of this world. When the magistrate affects to anticipate the decisions of the Supreme Judge in relation to such matters, he assumes a province that does not belong to him. It is not too much to say of such a man as Sir Thomas More, that he should have been obedient to the laws of his own intelligence, which would have sufficed to teach him the unreasonableness, and the general inefficiency of persecution: and that he should have been more mindful of the spirit and precepts of Christ, which show that persecution must be unchristian."], [201, "179 THE REFORMATION PARLIAMENT. BOOK VI Chap 3. John Petit, a wealthy citizen of London, to whose intelligent and honest judgment on affairs the king attached much importance, was suspected, and not without cause, of being a friend to such men as Bilney, Frith, and Tyndale. More took upon himself the office of inquisitor in the case of this man. He presented himself at the door of Petit's house, at a place near the river, called Petit's quay. When the door was opened, the wife of the merchant saw who had knocked, and hastened to her husband, who was ' in his closet ' at his prayers,' bidding him hasten from the place, as the lord chancellor was at the door. But the chan cellor, eager to take the heretic unawares, had fol lowed the wife, and entered the closet with her. Petit received him courteously, and it so happened that the visit did not yield the sort of evidence the chancellor sought. No obnoxious books or writings were disco vered. Nevertheless, More gave Petit in charge to the lieutenant of the Tower, and there, in contempt of petition and remonstrance, Petit died of the hard usage for which More was responsible.* The cases of Phillips and Field are instances showing still further how More could offend against law and humanity where heresy was concerned.! This bad feeling seems to have prompted him at times to gross slander. He declared that Bilney, who perished at Norwich, had read a re cantation of his errors at the stake.

Henry had hoped that the course taken by the English parliament would excite apprehension in Rome, and expedite his wishes in that quarter. But with the progress of the spirit of reform in England, came the progress of the imperial arms in Italy. France had lost her sooting in that country, and as it became more and more probable that England would be lost to the papacy, Clement found himself sinking more hopelessly than ever to the condition of a prisoner and a tool in the hands of Spain. He sighed deeply under this bondage, but saw no means of escape. France was enfeebled, England was remote, and south of the Alps Charles could do according to his pleasure.

It was maintained, indeed, that no Englishman, much less a king of Eng land, was at liberty to plead in an English cause in any court beyond the king's dominions.

When the cause was revoked to Rome, the point to be determined was, the validity, as to form, of the dispensation which had been granted by Julius. And now, through the sug gestion of Cranmer, it is said, it was formally alleged that such a dispensation must have been worthless, whatever may have been its form. That a man should not marry his brother's wife was said to be a divine law, and the authority of the pope, it was contended, was never meant to extend to an abrogation of such laws. On this question it was resolved to obtain the opinions of the learned over Christendom. In pursu ance of this object, intrigue, bribery, and intimidation were largely resorted to, and with little scruple on either side. The result is said to have been a sort of drawn battle, the opinions obtained being about one half on the one side, and the other half on the other, f But, if we may credit the language of Clement him self, the scale really turned very much in favour of the kinsr.

In the autumn of 1532 a grand meeting took place between Henry and Francis at Boulogne. It was the policy of Francis to perpetuate the alienation between Henry and Charles, and he was accordingly profuse, not only in his professions of attachment to Henry, but in his measures to render the papal court favour able to his wishes. The Christmas following, Charles was crowned emperor at Bologna, and some further attempt was then made to bring the ' king's matter' to a favourable issue. But the whole business con tinued to be, as it had long been, a contention in which Henry and Francis threatened to withdraw from the papal see if Clement did not sanction the divorce, and in which Charles threatened evils even more formidable if he did \u2014 the policy of his holiness being to oppose the arts of Italian cunning, the only weapon of his weakness, to the strength of these rival masters. f But soon a step was to be taken which would put an end to these protracted insincerities.

Recently the king of France and others had urged Henry to bring the embroilment to a close by that means. The king hesitated ; but, on learning the result of the negotiations at Bologna, he resolved to act on this advice. For some time past Anne had Meeting be tween Henry and Krancis. iSzz. October.

In this amount of forbearance and self-control we see enough to warrant the belief that Henry's great purpose must have been something much higher than the selfish and sensuous desire by which he has been supposed to have been wholly governed. He had often said that the substitution of one woman for another as a wife, would not have prompted him to take a single step in the weary business of the divorce ; and we may accept his words without supposing that his feeling towards Anne Boleyn, as compared with Catherine, had no influence upon his conduct. We are all beings of mixed motives at best. We never rise above what is substantially good. We can suppose Henry in the main a truthful man when he said that he had come to account his marriage with Catherine as unlawful, and when he declared that another marriage, which might give him the prospect of a male successor to the throne, was, in his judgment, of the first import ance to the future interests of the nation.

But it ceased to be so when he gave the state of a queen to another woman in the presence of the woman who was still his wife. Catherine had been unyielding before, surrendering herself to feelings sufficiently personal ; but now her passions became intensely those of the injured woman, prompting her to resist every approach and shade of compromise. The event, however, is now determined, and the actors in this drama, and the nation as spec tators, have to wait the issue. The king's marriage could not long remain a secret, and when known, still more innovating measures would be indispensable. In the following April, Cranmer, now archbishop of Canterbury, obtained a licence from the king to bring the cause relating to Catherine to an end by a decision in his own court. In granting this licence, Henry was careful to make the primate understand, that his sole authority was to judge according to the law of the case, in the name of a king who did not ' recognise any superior on earth ' but only God, and is not subject to the laws of any ' earthly creature.' Cranmer, assisted by four pre lates, opened his court at Dunstable, a few miles from Ampthill, where Catherine was then resident. To lord Vaux aud the gentlemen who waited upon her with the citation from the archbishop, Catherine replied that she repudiated utterly the authority of the tribunal from which they had come, and that she should in no way plead before it. The court, as a matter of course, accounted her contumacious, and proceeded with the trial. Witnesses were examined, and sentence was passed, which declared that ' the said pretended mar * riage always was, and still is, null and void.'* * Slate Papers, i. 394, 395.

Those who had always sympathized Chap\" 3' with Catherine, did so the more deeply, as she seemed \u00a3X\u00bbr to them to be sinking lower and lower in her sadness and her wrongs. Many who regarded the divorce as expedient, if not just, were pained by many of the circumstances which had come to be attendant upon it. But if we may judge from what passed in Lon don, on the last day of May and on some subsequent clays, when the grand pageant of Anne's coronation The corona took place, the mass of the people must have been satisfied that the right course had been taken, and that it became them to sustain what had been done. Hall has given a full and minute account of the pro cessions and holiday doings by which the citizens, and the companies of the metropolis, testified their loyalty ; and Henry addressed ' hearty thanks, with ' many good words,' to the ' mayor and his brethren' for those expressions of their good feeling as his subjects.* Henry sent information of these proceedings to the Henry emperor and the pope, reminding them of the respect cnaries and he had shown them by waiting so long in the hope of Clemcnt obtaining their approval, expressing his regret that necessity should have been laid upon him to act with out their concurrence, and his hope that their amity with him might not be disturbed by what had come to pass. Charles contented himself with saying that he knew what had taken place, and that the future must be left to show what the future would be. He wrote encouragingly, in the meanwhile, to those who as sured him that England would soon be in a state of insurrection, and stood prepared to avail himself of such circumstances, should they arise. f Clement was urged by the imperialist cardinals to launch the thun ders of the church against Henry without delay. But his holiness was busy at this juncture with an intrigue * Hall's Chron. 798-805. t Herbert, 166."], [208, "186 NATIONALISTS AND ROMANISTS. BOOK VI, Chap, 3. Altered policy of Francis. Henry ap peals to a general council, to detach Francis from his friendly relations with England, and he was disposed to proceed cautiously until the result of this policy should be ascertained.* As danger thickened about the path of Henry, the policy of Francis became obscure, wavering, and in sincere. He had so far committed himself to the course of the king of England, that if this country should be separated from the see of Rome, France was to follow her example, and to become an inde pendent patriarchate. But the hope of recovering influence in Italy through the good offices of Clement, now so much affected the French king, that he found excuses for evading such promises.! Not that Francis contemplated a rupture with England. Nothing he declared was farther from his thoughts. But the real object, nevertheless, of the negotiation between him and Clement was to place Christendom under the feet of a triumvirate, consisting of the emperor, the king of France, and his Holiness. The effect of this combination, as dreamers supposed, would be, to crush the Lutherans first, and England next. Henry saw the drift of these intrigues, and in his letters to Francis laid it bare in a tone of remonstrance remark able for its intelligence, dignity, and firmness. \\ Menaced with denunciations from Rome, Henry prudently anticipated the thunder from that quarter, by appealing from the authority of the pope to that of a general council. \u00a7 Clement felt the inconvenience of this move, and proposed a middle course.

It was not, he said, to the honour of the pope to hand over to a commission an act of justice which he should have the honesty and courage to perform himself; nor was it to be expected that the king of England should traverse a cause beyond the limits of his own dominions, to be argued before any tribunal of less rank than a general council.* On the 12th of July, six weeks after the coronation, clement Clement had declared Cranmer's judgment at Dun- SemseT8 stable illegal, and the marriage between Henry and b\"nds\"s\" Anne Boleyn void. But the penalties of excommuni- penalties. cation, incurred by those proceedings, were postponed until the close of September. Time was thus to be given for repentance. f But September passed, and October passed, and the signs of contrition came not. And now the time had arrived for the long-expected conference between Francis and Clement. It took place at Marseilles, in October, and extended to about the middle of November. The liberties ceded to the Oallican church in that conference made it all but independent. Francis urged that the same liberal course should be pursued towards England. It was to the interest of both that Henry should not sever himself from the church of Rome, and that they should both remain on friendly terms with him. Could not this be accomplished ? Clement felt the force of these element representations. He now went so far as to say, that eondha- \u00b0 the cause of the king of England was a just cause, and ,ion that if his majesty would only make a little reasonable concession, so as to furnish a plausible ground for conceding his claim, the imperialists in the consistory, as committed parties, should be excluded from having any voice in the question, and judgment should thus t State Papers, vii. 480. * Foxe, v. no."], [210, "188 NATIONALISTS AND ROMANISTS. book vi. be given in his favour. We do not know the exact 1HAP' 3' words that passed, but they appear to have been words to this effect. Henry On his return to Paris, Francis received a letter from (ormTgTe'a\" Henry, in which he stated that it was not his wish to league8.'1\"\" separate himself from the Catholic princes, but that, if December, shut up to such a course, he should certainly do his best to form a grand Protestant league, by joining himself to the Lutherans. Francis was alarmed by this communication, and sent Du Bellay, the bishop of Paris, to apprise Henry of what had passed in the conference at Marseilles, and to urge upon the king a cautious and conciliatory course.* Du Bellay knew the king of England and the English people well, and was exceedingly desirous of healing this breach, even at the eleventh hour. To be successful might be to prevent Europe from becoming marshalled into two hostile camps on the side of opposite religions. The uiebisho* WS^10P obtained from Henry so much concession, or ot Fans, so much of what looked like concession, that he felt warranted in proceeding with all speed to Rome.

The imperialists in the consistory, who, according to Clement's promise to Francis, were not now to be parties to the judgment, seized on this circumstance, and insisted that sentence should be given on the ground first taken, without delay.

But this is idle dreaming. There was no real contingency in this matter. The later and more visible causes of this change were weak, and apparently from chance, but there were remote and latent causes which were not weak, and in which there was no chance. Duringlong centuries the tendencies towards this result had been in action. True, the men who should have led the English clergy in those days were weak \u2014 but what made them weak ? And the men who were on the side of reform were strong \u2014 but what made them strong? The one represented an order of things which had grown old, diseased, and could not live in such a soil as England had become. The other repre sented an order of things which was indigenous to the people, possessed the vigour and bloom of youth, and promised much for the time to come. Yes \u2014 the mind which operated through the greater influences, in this great chapter of our history, operated through the less. The less came upon a scale which had been all but turned by the weight of the greater. Had not these later and smaller instrumentalities come as they did, others like them must have come in their place. The tide had set in \u2014 its rising higher was inevitable. Nations, like individuals, may rough hew their path, may do it with a strong hand, but, after all, there is a Providence that shapes their ways. How Henry regarded these final proceedings in Rome on this long-agitated question will presently appear. In this place we must halt, to be observant of the measures of the English parliament during the three months preceding that decision. The session opened in the middle of January, and ' there were grave matters then demanding attention. The act which withdrew from the see of Rome the large field of revenue known by the name of annates, or first-fruits, had been passed with the understanding"], [213, "191 THE REFORMATION PARLIAMENT. that it was not to receive the royal assent, should the book vi. pontiff become more reasonable. But Clement had CJ^P_3 given no evidence of greater wisdom, and the act now \u201e's;4 1 1 * TT 1 1 \u2022 COn\" became law. Here, however, a new perplexity pre- ceming an sented itself. Denied his annates, the pope would passed. withhold the formalities of consecration from future bishops. But this difficulty was soon surmounted. The form of election to a vacant bishopric was left *?\" form x. a of electing with the chapters ; the reality of election, which had bishops. sometimes proceeded from the king, sometimes from the pope, and often from both conjointly, was now vested exclusively in the crown. The crown was to nominate, and if the chapter did not elect the person named within twelve days, they became subject to a premunire. f The act which put an end to the legis- Legislative lative functions of the clergy was also finally passed, j the clergy Some attempt, moreover, was made to check the at an end' wrongs and cruelties to which persons were exposed to persecu when charged with heresy. The clergy had never tl0U' been more zealous or pitiless in their proceedings against heresy than during the last two years \u2014 years in which the reforming spirit of the commons might have been expected to suggest what the effect of such a policy was likely to be.$ It was now enacted, that in future, the clergy should not arrest persons charged with heresy, nor examine such persons, at their pleasure. The only cases with which they were to meddle, in the time to come, were such as should have been sustained by lawful witnesses, and before magistrates. The ac cused, moreover, might claim to be admitted to bail, and the ordinary was not to set aside such claim without the consent of two justices of the peace.

The country England had settled its own terms. The answer expected to nnaTjiuuj these terms was simply yes or no. And in all these c^ent. proceedings, the senators in this memorable parlia ment had not only to brave the terrors of the Vatican, but to meet danger at home on which a mind less equal to the crisis than that of Thomas Cromwell might well have looked with dismay. It was not to have been expected that a proud and ancient nation would be found to change its faith in a day, or with out a struggle. The majority of the people might be comparatively passive. But nations are not governed by majorities. The momentum which determines their course comes from intelligence rather than from numbers. Intelligence, however, does not come over all at once from the past to the present, from the old to the new. In England enough had so come to have turned the scale on the better side, but not enough to preclude all hope of a reaction from minds averse to change. Such a marked disturbance on the surface of society, implied a deep disturbance of men's thoughts and passions. Fear, interest, and the honest love of old memories, would suffice to ensure that all the daring and self-sacrifice would not be on one side. Friars preached against the king's policy to his face, in the presence of court and people. And if the pul pit of a chapel royal could be so used, it is easy to imagine what many other pulpits must have been. On the lips of many of the inferior clergy, no language was so common as that of sedition, or that of slander against the king and Anne Boleyn. One of these offenders was told, when his rebel words were repeated in his hearing, that he deserved to be tied in a sack and thrown in the Thames. Be it so, was his reply, there is a way to heaven by water as well as by land.

This young woman was originally a farmhouse ser- vant. She was a person of good character, but of no remarkable intelligence. In 1525 she suffered much from disease ; and subsequently had seasons in which she seemed to be insensible to what was immediately about her, and in those intervals of abstraction, or ' trance,' as they were called, she delivered sentiments which were said to be so holy that they must have been inspired. From this stage, the transition to self deception and imposture was easy. The parish priest reported the matter to Wareham, archbishop of Canterbury. Wareham sent a monk named Booking to examine the case ; and Booking so ordered his com munications with the bewildered woman, as to send abroad the rumour that a miracle in support of the Catholic faith had been wrought by her means. She became a witness for the church as it stood, and, in the spirit of prophecy, foretold the ruin of all who should presume to innovate on its ancient right and usage. Catherine was a great saint. Henry was in danger of a dishonourable death. Even the pope was not so secure as to be beyond the need of warning. In de fiance of the words of the prophetess, Henry married Anne Boleyn, and the time within which a signal retribution was to have fallen upon him, passed away, and no retribution had come. Arrest of During seven years the monks of Canterbury were Kent!and0f allowed to make their uses of this poor lunatic.

Catherine and the princess Mary had book vi. listened to frequent communications from her. Many CnAP\" 3' of the English nobles, with numbers belonging to their households, were implicated in the folly or the crime of similar proceedings ; and so were the marchioness of Exeter, and the countess of Salisbury. These last names brought the Nevilles, the family of the great earl of Warwick, and the White Rose faction, within the circle of suspicion. As the burden of the nun's prophecies consisted in their opposition to the reli gious change now in progress, and in their political and treasonable tendency, it was natural that all persons known to be lending an ear to them should be accounted as disaffected. It is now known to have been arranged, that so soon as the consistory should have pronounced its final sentence against the king, the nun, and a number of ' spiritual and religious ' persons,' were to endeavour, by preaching and other means, to kindle an insurrection ; and there is good reason to suppose that Catherine and Mary were pre pared to welcome events which might reverse whatever had been done against their interests.* The parliament took up this business. The nun Proceed of Kent, and five monks, were declared guilty of Fisher and treason on their own confessions. The poor girl took More' the blame of all the ' falsehood and mischief con nected with what had been taking place upon herself. But much larger blame rested on the weakness of many who had credited her sayings, and especially on the wickedness of those who had prompted her to utter them. The judgment which sent Elizabeth Barton and the monks to the scaffold, passed by the names of many persons who, in other circumstances, would have found themselves exposed to trouble. But the names of Fisher and More were not to be overlooked.

Cromwell apprised them, that if they were prepared to confess their error, and to ask the royal pardon, a pardon would be granted. More readily conformed to these terms. His judgment of the prophetess had altogether changed. But Fisher stood on the defensive. He had looked on the nun as a holy woman. He knew nothing of any intention to arm against the king. In brief, he knew nothing which he had not good reason to suppose the king himself knew. He had, therefore, no apology to make, and could ask no pardon. It is probable that the bishop felt as he spoke. It may be, also, that he had a painful remembrance of the disgrace which he had incurred, not long since, through his want of firmness when challenged by the commons touching the in jurious words he had uttered concerning them. Cer tainly, he now seemed to covet a place among those who suffer for righteousness' sake. It was from his sick bed that the bishop wrote as above, and the government showed its wisdom in forbearing to pro ceed against him.* Tidings of the judgment which had been pronounced against the king in Rome, reached England on the 7th of April. The questioning of Fisher and More, on the affair of the Nun of Kent, had taken place nearly two months before ; and the Act of Succession had not only passed, but, as we have seen, an oath had been attached to it which might be universally exacted, and which was meant to be exacted very largely. The news that the final step had been taken by the con sistory could not fail to dispose men to look with interest for what was to follow.

To these CnAP' 3\" signs of division at home, the probability of war from abroad was now added. According to the common rumour and expectation, the spiritual thunder of the pope was to be followed by the material thunder of the emperor. But Henry was equal to the exigency. He promptly augmented his naval force, strengthened the garrisons of the country, and stood prepared to meet the worst. The very day which brought the news of the final proceedings in Rome, appears to have witnessed the confirmation given by Henry to the pro ceedings in the two houses of parliament, and the two houses of convocation, which declared the authority of the bishop of Rome to be that of an ordinary bishop, and no more.* It has been justly said that \u2014 ' Five ' years before, if a heretic had ventured so desperate ' an opinion, the clergy would have shut their ears ' and run upon him.'f Revolution had been moving apace. The oath attached to the Act of Succession required The Sa\u2122es all persons to whom it was tendered to swear, not only that they would be faithful to the princess Elizabeth, and to such other offspring as should be born to the king from his marriage with Anne Boleyn ; but they were required to declare that the marriage of Henry with Catherine had been invalid, and that his marriage with Anne was alone a lawful marriage. It was a grave matter to call upon such a people as the English people then were to take such an oath. Not a few among them had no decided opinion in regard to the subtle casuistry of this mar riage question, much as it had been discussed ; and * Herbert, 173-175. 25 Hen. VIII. cap. 2. 26 Hen.

BOOK VI Chap. 3. Fisher and More refuse lo take it. Impolicy of the oath. among those who had made up their mind on that subject, there were many who were willing to bind themselves to be obedient to the law of succession as it had been determined by parliament, but who were by no means prepared to say that they accounted the marriage between Henry and Catherine as having been from the beginning illegal and void. This was exactly the position of Fisher and More. When sum moned by the commissioners, they expressed their readiness to accept the law concerning succession to the throne as defined by the statute, and to be faithful to it ; but to the portion of the oath which prescribed a declaration of opinion concerning the king's divorce and his second marriage, they could in nowise con form. Cromwell and Cranmer urged compliance by every argument they could devise, but without effect. It was a serious dilemma which these statesmen had thus brought upon themselves. To accept an oath thus limited from these distinguished men, would be to bind themselves to accept an oath in that form from all persons taking the same exception. On the other hand, to insist that the oath taken should be according to the letter of the statute, would be to bring a sad odium upon their policy, and to entail other evils, in all probability of a very formidable de scription. These wise men had not acted wisely in this matter. The exercise of power contemplated by this statute was such as no conceivable circumstances could justify. To construe a refusal to take the oath in the prescribed form into proof of holding opinions at variance with its purport, and then to proceed to punish the opinions of which the recusant was pre sumed to be self-convicted, as treason, was a stretch of power for which no adequate plea was possible. It is true that the point at issue was one of papal casuistry, and that on such questions Fisher and More had never felt the least scruple in dealing with accused persons as they were themselves now dealt with.

His silence, if persisted in, was his conviction. But injustice, pushed to the extent of cruelty on the one side, does not cease to be what it is now that it has changed sides. Nor was the injustice of this policy less patent than its weakness. If men really held certain opinions, it was not possible they should be made to swear them away. But it was possible to bind them against acting on those opinions either by deeds or words. In the present case, it should have been enough, in the first instance, to have demanded an oath of allegiance to the offspring of the king by Anne Boleyn. Even now, it would have been the wiser course to have narrowed the compass of the statute to that point, rather than to have persisted in a policy which, if not seen to be unjust, was felt to be pregnant with so much discredit and danger. A re fusal to take the oath as thus limited would have been a confession of treason, and the feeling of the country would have sustained any measures of severity that might have been necessary to quell such manifest dis affection. Cranmer, and some other persons, would have retraced their steps to this extent.* But Crom well was not a man to look back. The loss of his only son upon the scaffold, he said, would not have pained him so much as this want of loyalty in Sir Thomas More. It became clear that the government had chosen its course.

An oath without a judg- ' ment concerning the divorce, said the king and his minister, would be an oath leaving all men at liberty to regard the offspring of Catherine as legitimate, and the offspring of Anne as illegitimate. True ; but, if men so thought, was it in the power of an oath to make them think otherwise? Fisher and More so thought. Their conduct could have no other meaning. But it was their lot to find, that Henry and his par liament had come into the place of Clement and his consistory ; and to see the same cruel means employed in support of the new order of things, which they had themselves been so free to use in support of the old. Many ecclesiastics, and laymen of position, were summoned with Fisher and More, but the bishop of Rochester and the ex-chancellor stood alone on that day as recusants. They were committed, in the first instance, to the charge of the abbot of Westminster, and were sent subsequently to the Tower. Within the walls of that ancient prison, surrounded by the busy life of that great cit}r, they were left to their own reflections for the next twelve months. Ought it not to have been foreseen that cases rendering a hesitancy of this kind expedient on the part of the government were likely to arise \u2014 and, foreseen, should they not have been avoided ? The country, however, remained quiet under these proceedings. Charles was kept in check by Francis ; and the papal censures, whether against the king or the nation, seemed to have wasted themselves in air. But it was no secret that many of the clergy, while consenting to take the oath exacted by the govern ment, were by no means well affected towards the great scheme of innovation which that oath implied. But what could they do ? Not only poverty, but martyrdom, would be the consequence of resistance. By one mode of reasoning or another, they brought themselves to the conclusion, that it would be wise to submit, and, in the meanwhile, to hope that a"], [223, "THE REFORMATION PARLIAMENT. 201 state of affairs so new and deplorable might be of book vi short duration.

Nor was it left to them to discharge this duty in any superficial or slovenly manner. The government sent them minute instruc tions showing how they should acquit themselves, and also a condensed report of what had been done, and the reasons of it, which was to be read aloud by each man to his usual congregation. Pulpits were in those days what newspapers are now \u2014 the great media of nearly all state advertisements ; and every pulpit throughout England was to be employed, not only in giving publicity to these state documents, but in in culcating on the people the ecclesiastical and political obedience thus required from them. The bishops were to see that the clergy conformed to these in junctions ; and the sheriffs and justices were to see that the bishops were not negligent in their depart ment of service. At the same time, it was commanded, that the clergy should abstain, for the next twelve months, from preaching on doubtful matters, such as miracles, pilgrimages, celibacy of the clergy, purgatory, and the worship of saints and relics. On all these topics the court orthodoxy had become unsettled. Preachers were to confine their teaching to such doc trines as might be found ' in scripture and in the words ' of Christ \u2014 and not to make God's laws and man's laws ' of equal authority.'

So far had the king advanced in the work of reformation before the close of 1534-* But everything about the proceedings of the govern ment betrayed its conviction that much of the out ward obedience shown would be insincere, and that instances of open and daring resistance should be ex pected. The clergy of the north, and the religious orders generally, were known to be strongly disloyal. Even the archbishop of York, and the bishop of Dur ham, were under suspicion. Prophets affected to predict the speedy return of the ' old learning.' The confes sional whispered the doctrine of mental reservation, and became the school of much covert treason. f Such was the course which affairs were taking when parliament was reassembled in the autumn of 1534. The act against appeals, and that which subjected the clergy to the authority of the crown, had declared the king to be head alike of church and state. But the complete settlement of this doctrine in our history dates from the Act of Supremacy passed in this session. This act marked off the ground for battle between the two great parties\u2014 the Nationalists and Romanists. J To recognise the supremacy of the crown as defined in this act, was to admit its compe tency to do all that had recently been done. To deny it, was to defer to the authority which had con demned the divorce, the second marriage, and the Act of Succession, and which, by declaring Catherine to be still queen of England, declared Mary to be next in succession to the throne.

Chap' 3\" They spoke of Henry as a monster whom the judg ment of heaven must soon overtake, and Anne was classed with the lowest of her sex. It was resolved to check this licentious speech. Six months had passed since Clement had pronounced judgment against the king. Parliament had not met since that memorable event. Henry's Tudor temper had been roused, and the temper of the nation had done more than keep pace with it. An act was now passed, in titled ' An Newstatnt* ' Act whereby Offences be made High Treason,' which declared \u2014 ' That if any person or persons, after the first ' day of February next coming, do maliciously wish, ' will, or desire, by words or writing, or by craft ' imagine, invent, practice, or attempt any bodily ' harm to be done to the king's most royal person, the ' queen's, or their heirs apparent, or to deprive them, ' or any of them, of the dignity, title, or name of their ' royal estates, or slanderously and maliciously publish ' and pronounce by express writing or words that the ' king our sovereign lord should be heretic, schismatic, ' tyrant, infidel, or usurper of the crown \u2014 that all such ' persons, their aiders, counsellors, concerters, and ' abettors, being thereof lawfully convict according to ' the laws and customs of the realm, shall be adjudged ' traitors.'* The government might require any man, at its dis- J*\u2122\"r\"\u00a3,t cretion, to bind himself to obedience according to the of the inter tenor of this statute ; and refusal to take the oath, or j^ven to\" to answer satisfactorily the questions put in relation this sta,l,te to it, was to be accounted as proof of disaffection \u2014 -of high treason. In so far as this statute was designed to empower the government to reach opinion, and to punish that as crime, all that we have said in regard to the oath imposed by the Act of Succession applies to it. On the ground of this act, suspected persons * 26 Hen. VIII. cap. 13."], [226, "204 NATIONALISTS AND ROMANISTS. BOOK VI Ohap. 3.

How far it was intended to be so used does not appear, but no man with the least sense of justice or humanity should have assented to an act admitting of such an applica tion. The king, however, and his minister, regarded the cause to which they were committed as the cause of the nation ; this cause, in their view, was exposed to the last degree of danger from enemies at home and abroad; and the parties, it was said, who had made such instruments of rule necessary had made them lawful. We cannot but regard this reasoning as short-sighted and fallacious. We feel persuaded that the national interest would have been better se cured by milder measures \u2014 measures which, as having reference only to actual indications of treasonable ten dencies, might have been acted upon, even largely, without danger. The policy which makes laws so severe that they can never be more than partially executed, is fraught with evil. The discretion thus lodged with the executive, leaves the complexion of government to be determined, not by the defined cer tainties of law, but by the accidents of character in its administrators. It is clear, from the conduct of the authors of these measures, that they were themselves sensible to the importance of not acting upon such powers except as a last resort. Months passed away, and the Act of Supremacy seemed to have become a dead letter. The inaction of the government, as usual, was attributed to fear, and the men whose convictions as Romanists prompted them to encourage resistance became more bold. ' Sundry persons, as well religious as secular ' priests, and curates in their parishes,' defended and extolled the authority of the bishop of Rome, and prayed for him in their pulpits.

No viewsofthe doubt, many of the men who thus betrayed their feel- S^.68*' ing were men sincerely convinced that their spiritual allegiance was due to the pontiff, and that only their secular allegiance was due to the king. On the ground of scripture and of reason, as they thought, Christen dom ought to have a spiritual sovereign, enthroned with becoming dignity, and so sustained by sanctity and learning as to be qualified to act as an ultimate authority on all great spiritual questions. The in terests of the great Christian commonwealth, and the honour of its common faith, were thought to demand that such deference should be shown to the Christian priesthood, and during ten centuries or more, such homage had been rendered to it. The doctrine, it was maintained, which would tolerate differences of opinion, resolved itself into indifference to all religious truth, and to the fatal consequences of mistake in re lation to it. It was not to be supposed, said these persons, that the Almighty should reveal important truths to men without instituting some authority which should be always ready to distinguish between them and the errors which the ignorance or passions of mankind might be disposed to thrust into their place. Such an authority existed in the Catholic church, and the church or state which made light of that authority opened the floodgates of falsehood, ir religion, and spiritual ruin upon society. To become confessors or martyrs, accordingly, on the side of Romanism, was to tread in the steps of the wisest and holiest of men in bygone ages ; and to suffer in the cause of Christ, of truth, and of humanity. * Burnet, Hist. i. 277, 278.

But this was only one side of the picture, and a side which was accounted by others as more imaginary than real. What the papal hierarchy might have been if the great majority of its members had been spiritual men was a matter for conjecture; what it had become in histor}7, and especially of late, with its great majority of official persons consisting of anything but spiritual men, was a fact. The nationalist party in England judged of this system, not by what it might promise as a theory, but by what had resulted from it as put into action. So judged, it had proved, in their estimation, a signal failure. The nations of Christendom, it was alleged, were competent to con serve truth for themselves, and at much less cost both to their substance and their spiritual independence, than by perpetuating their old relations to the see of Rome. The religious reformers went much further. In their view, it was little less than blasphemy for an order of men to assume that the Deity, in revealing Himself to mankind, had acquitted Himself so indif ferently, as to have made it necessary that they should take upon them to act as his interpreters, and, in fact, to do what He had done but so imperfectly, more as it ought to be done. The effects of this presumption, it was said, were such as might have been expected to flow from it. The little truth thus preserved was in great part neutralized hj error, and was everywhere overlaid with superstitious fancies, and connected with customs the natural fruit of such fancies. The harm which might come from leaving men to interpret the Bible for themselves would be nothing, compared with the effects which had followed the secreting of that volume, and the prohibition of inquiry. The natural tendency of this usurpation over the authoritv both of God and of the human conscience had been, a*s they believed, to darken the popular mind, to deprave its moral feeling, and, in brief, to dwarf and enthral humanity.

But it was determined to select men whose character had given the greatest in fluence to their example. One day, three priors sought 1535. an audience of Cromwell. Their object was to pray Al\"iK that the fraternities under their charge might be exempt from taking the oath of supremacy, or at least that they might be allowed to take it with some modification. Cromwell discussed the question with these men. But neither side was prepared to yield, and the minister sent the ecclesiastics to the Tower. Two of these persons represented monasteries in the country ; Haughton, the third, was at the head of the Carthusians of the Charter House in London. Haughton and his monks appear to have been pious, conscientious, and simple-minded men. They had hesitated to take the succession oath, and the prior had been sent to the Tower on that ground. But, after a painful struggle, he had conformed, and the brotherhood under him had followed his example. The oath of supremacy, however, was, to consciences already somewhat ill at ease, a still greater difficulty. The conclusion of the inmates of the Charter House was, that they could not take it. Being thus re solved, they confessed themselves one to another, par took of the eucharist together, and awaited their fate as men already condemned. When examined, they declined to take the prescribed Examin. oath. Reasoning, persuasion, terror, produced no Haughton. impression on these men, So their fate was sealed; and Haughton then stated plainly, in behalf of him self and his brethren, the ground of their refusal. It was, that they could not, without peril to their souls, cede that authorit)r to the king in religious matters"], [230, "208 NATIONALISTS AND ROMANISTS. BOOK VI. Chap. 3. May 4.

The three priors, and a monk of great reputation for piety, named Reynolds, were sentenced to die the death of traitors. They all suffered at Tyburn, and, to add to the startling effect of subjecting such men to so bar barous a death, they were all sent to the place of exe cution in the habit of their order. Haughton suffered first, and his companions were urged in succession to avoid the same dreadful end by submission, but in vain. Six weeks later, three monks from the Charter House suffered at the same place for the same offence. But this was the end of the work of the executioner on the Carthusians. Ten of those who were left were sent to prison, where nine are said to have died of prison fever. Two were hung in chains as insurrec tionists, in Yorkshire ; the remainder took the oaths under mental reservation, casting themselves, by agree ment, on the mercy of God in so doing \u2014 these were lodged for a time in different monasteries.* After such measures towards the Carthusians, the case of Fisher and More, difficult as it might be to deal with, could not be passed over. Deputations were sent to them in the Tower for the professed purpose of bringing them to compliance by argument and * Historia Marty rum Anglorum. Strype, Memorials, i. 299-^09, 427-430. It' is proper, in recording these severities, that some instance should be given of the temper in which some of the clergy expressed themselves in regard to the king and his proceedings. Hale, who was in dicted as a clerk, was charged with saying to Feron, also a clerk, ' Until the king and the rulers of this realm be plucked by the pate, and brought, as we say, to pot, we shall never live merrily in England, which I pray God may chance, and now shortly to come to pass. Ireland is set against him, which will never shrink in their quarrel; and what think you of Wales ?

Rich, a bad man, who had risen to the office of solicitor-general, was sent to both prisoners on this errand. More, when upon his trial, told this man to his face, that he had been known from his youth as one of the most untruthful and unprincipled men living. Nevertheless, this man had been empowered to make promises, both to Fisher and More, in the name of the king ; and, to induce a freedom of expression, he had pledged himself solemnly that what they might say should be strictly a secret, to be known only to his majesty. The man failed in his attempts to persuade. He then became the one witness on whose testimony these deeply-injured men were condemned as traitors, and the words he had drawn from them by the most artful means, were the only evidence on which the commissioners founded their judgment. It is true, there was treason, according to the bad laws then existing, in the simple refusal to take the prescribed oath. But it is observable that the government did not take that ground. More and Fisher were con demned on the ground of alleged treasonable words, and the only words adduced against them, were the words which this one witness \u2014 this solicitor-general, Rich \u2014 affirmed to have been spoken to himself in the Tower. It is not easy to imagine a more shameless proceeding. And yet the king and his ministers must all have been parties to what was done.* * State Trials, i. 367-408. The words of the indictment against Fisher were \u2014 ' That John Fisher, late of the city of Rochester, in the county of Kent, clerk, also called John Fisher, late of the city of Rochester, bishop, treacherously imagining and attempting to deprive the king of his title as supreme head of the church of England, did, 7th of May, 27 Hen. VIII., at the Tower of London, openly declare in English ' The king, our sovereign lord, is not supreme head on earth of the church of Eng land.' ' \u2014 MS. Baga de Secretis, pouch vii. bundle 2, State Paptr Office. It should be added that Rich denied upon the trial having had any authority in making his communication with either More or Fisher. But he had declared the contrary to those parties, and the government con demned them on the evidence thus obtained. \u2014 Ibid.buudle 3. 11 P"], [232, "210 NATIONALISTS AND ROMANISTS. BOOK VI. Chap. 3. Fisher and More not faultless. There were, indeed, other circumstances which dis posed the government to such action, though no men tion was made of them in court. Paul III., who had now come into the place of Clement, had been so im prudent as to raise bishop Fisher, while under the charge of treason against his sovereign, to the rank of a cardinal.* The feelings of Henry and Cromwell became bitter. They were in no mood to hearken to moderate counsels. Nor was this all. Henry had written to Fisher some months before, hoping to change his opinion. The bishop promised that the king's letters should be private. But he nevertheless sent them to other hands, along with his replies, together with other writings on the same subject. f And if we may credit the assertions of Henry, of Cromwell, and of some other parties, the language and conduct, both of Fisher and More, while in the Tower, had been such as to betray their readiness to encourage opposition to the measures of the government. Certainly, if the sneering and bantering style in which More replied to the bishops of Durham, Bath, and Winchester, when invited by their lordships to accompany them to the coronation of Anne Boleyn, may be taken as a speci men of his manner when touching on current poli tics, he could hardly have been so cautious in his expressions as his statements when upon his trial would lead us to suppose. | If More was thus wanting in prudence, failure of this kind was likely to be much more serious with Fisher. They were not condemned, however, for anything of this nature. Sentence was passed upon them on the ground of what they had said to Rich, and only tacitly on the old ground of refusing the oaths. \u00a7 On the fifth day after listening to his sentence in * State Papers, vii. 604. f See Bedyll's letter to Cromwell in Suppression of the Monasteries, 45, 46.

Aged, sick, and feeble as he was, he ascended the scaffold stairs without assistance. What followed was a sad spectacle. But there the restlessness and sorrows of the good man's life came to a close. As if in defiance of the feeling that would be so deeply offended by what was done, the head of the venerable prelate was exposed to the gaze of the populace on London Bridge. Four davs after the execution of Fisher, a grand An(1 of t J . . ~ More. jury of Middlesex found a true bill against Sir Thomas More, and five days later the commissioners at West minster Hall pronounced him guilty of high treason. More, as the reader has seen, denounced Rich as utterly unworthy of credit ; but when the verdict of guilty was returned against him, he declared openly, that the parliament, by meddling with the question of the divorce, and the question of the supremacy, had entered upon ground beyond its province.* More, strange to say, had walked in the morning from the Tower to Westminster. On reaching the court he was so exhausted from weakness, induced by his long confinement, that he was allowed to be seated during the trial. He returned to his prison by water. On the stairs of the Tower a scene took place which deeply moved all who witnessed it. Mrs. Roper, More's beloved daughter, was there to meet him, and to obtain his last blessing. On seeing him approach, she rushed into the avenue formed by the armed men, and fell sobbing on his neck, crying ' Oh, my father ! ' oh, my father !' The loving father gave the loving child the blessing she sought, and a few brief words of comfort. She then tore herself away, but had passed the distance of a few paces only, when, under a new * Strype's Memorials, i. Ap. xlviii. p 2"], [234, "212 NATIONALISTS AND ROMANISTS. BOOK VI. Chap. 3.

Her woman, too, Dorothy Collis, an old and faithful servant, could not forbear to express her feeling in the manner of her mistress\u2014 she, too, kissed and embraced her master in his trouble. More said of this Dorothy, afterwards, ' It was homely, ' but very lovingly done.' Five days after his trial, More had the feeling that his end was near. On the evening of that day he sent his hair shirt, and a whip, with which he had done his penance, to his daughter. The next morn ing, in accordance with his presentiment, Sir Thomas Pope arrived, and informed him that it was the king's pleasure he should die at nine o'clock. Sir Thomas was an old friend, and taking leave of the doomed man, grasped his hand strongly, and burst into tears. More, who was calm and collected in all these scenes, bid him be comforted, and to look forward to the world where their next greeting would be ' merrily' made, and where they should ' live and love together in ' eternal bliss.' More would have gone to the scaffold in a rich suit of apparel, had not Sir William King ston, the lieutenant of the Tower, prevailed upon him, with some difficulty, to do otherwise. So at nine o'clock Sir Thomas More, late chancellor of England, paced his way, under the usual guard, through the open space between the Tower gate and Tower Hill. He bore in his hand a red cross, g-lanc ing at some moments towards heaven. His face was thin and pale. His beard, which was not usual with him, had been allowed to grow long. Wit and humour were too natural in him to be quelled by any pressure of calamity. His vein in this respect seemed at times hardly consistent with right feeling, from its contrast to such scenes. When sentence was pronounced upon him, he was told that the king, in his great mercy, had ordered, as in the case of Fisher, that he should die by decapitation, and not under the usual"], [235, "THE REFORMATION PARLIAMENT. 213 penalties for treason. ' God save his majesty,' was book vi. the reply, ' from showing any more such mercy, and c\"Ar' 3' ' my posterity from such pardons.' And now, when he had reached the scaffold, the unsettledness of the structure, and his weakness, led him to put forth his hand for help, and he was heard to say \u2014 ' See me safe ' up ; as for my coming down again, I can shift for ' myself When his last religious act had closed, and he laid his neck upon the block, he signalled the headsman to wait a moment, and then drawing his beard forward from beneath his chin, he said, as if to himself, ' Pity that should be cut \u2014 that can't have ' committed treason.'

Paul III. declared that the death of Fisher should be a more memorable tragedy for England than the murder of Becket.* But the world had not been stationary since the thirteenth century, and Henry VIII. possessed means of self-defence which had not been at the disposal of Henry II. Henry condescended to address letters of explanation to the king of France, to Germany, and to the pontiff. But the tone of those documents was that of firm, if not haughty, self-vindication. The men who had suffered, he affirmed, had not suffered simply as holding disloyal opinions, but as having given encouragement by words and acts to disaffec tion, and to treasonable conspiracy. The conclusion of all was, that he deeply lamented the necessity of resorting to such means of self-protection, but that, if such crimes were to be repeated, come what might, such punishments would follow. f Had the seditious words and conduct attributed to Fisher and More after their death been fairly proved against them on their trial, their case would have been of another complexion. Great as was the danger to which the interests of the nation were at that time exposed, it was not so great as to warrant a policy of this nature. If to have spared these men would have been to endanger the reformation ; that cause may be said to have been endangered much more by the course which was taken towards them.

The question concerning the monasteries was one v lsitation t -ii-iT ill of the mo- of great significance. It should be remembered, now - HsobjectT ever, that the commission to inquire into the state of those establishments was a commission, in the first instance, merely with a view to their reformation. It did not contemplate their extinction. f Great changes, it was believed, would be shown to be neces sary, but nothing more was expected. In tender ing the oath on the succession, and on the supremacy, the government found the clergy generally conform able. But the religious orders, both monks and friars, were almost as generally recusants. This difference is explained in part by the special relation in which those communities stood to the papal see. The clergy were subject in all matters of discipline to their re spective diocesans ; but the religious orders, for cen turies past, had been wont to claim entire freedom from such oversight and control, on the ground of ' exemptions' to that effect, which had been conferred on them by the see of Rome. It was natural that this independence of local inspection and authority should become the occasion of disorder; and having proved fatal to the character of these communities, it was ere long to prove fatal to their existence. Com mon fame described them as devoid alike of purity and patriotism. It was time the truth of the matter should be known.

Chap' 3' In theory, the principle which lay at the foundation of all these institutions was the principle of self sacrifice ; and the object of the sacrifice was to create an order of men whose vocation would be, not only to offer prayer for the departed, but to extend the benefits of instruction, consolation, and of hospitality to the living. They were to take this yoke upon them, that their days might be spent in lightening the bur dens of humanity. No wonder that men supposed to have taken up such a mission should have become the objects of popular veneration. We may regret that what seemed so fair in purpose, should have been but so imperfectly realized in practice \u2014 in short, that this department of the papal system, which promised to be its best, should have become its worst. But so it was. No feature in that system did so much to hasten its fall, in all the countries which were to become Protestant. The report which the commissioners presented to Report of parliament, was utterly destroyed by authority under tbe \"\u00b0ltor= queen Mary. But the documents relating to this measure which have been preserved are very many, and enough to show the result of the investigation. The visitors were no doubt men with a bias on the side of reform. But where they found establishments honourably conducted, they appear to have been willing to make a true report. It is manifest, however, that in the great majority of cases they had no good account to give. Manv of the tales afloat on this subject were no doubt exaggerations, or wholly false ; but, rejecting every thing of that nature that could be reasonably rejected, it was found that in some houses the inmates were kept much below the required number, that so the proceeds of the property might be privately appro priated, or become larger in distribution by passing into fewer hands ; that, in others, the number of ser vants kept in the abbey livery sometimes exceeded the"], [240, "218 NATIONALISTS AND ROMANISTS.

From many causes, the C\"AF' 3\" evil in such establishments had come immeasurably to outweigh the good. It was of the first importance to the future of this country that they should, be swept utterly away, and nothing short of this utter exposure would have sufficed to that end.* When this ' report appeared in writing' before the two houses, with the ' names of the parties and their ' factes,' the indignation of the commons was great. Nothing, we are told, was heard, but ' Down with \u2022 them.' However, a ' great debate' ensued, and in the course The smaller of the discussion it appeared that the smaller monas- series, where the vicious could most easily act in concert, were the most corrupt, while some of the larger establishments could be described as places in which ' religion is right well kept and observed.' It was resolved, accordingly, to proceed with discrimina tion. The act passed suppressed all the monasteries where the inmates were less than twelve, and provided that the men in such houses should be sent to some of the greater monasteries, or that they should be released from their vows, and a gratuity assigned to them according to their degree.

The loss of a few schools in the monasteries was well compensated by the foundation of others on a more enlightened plan, and with much better instructors, and, after the lapse of some years, the com munication of substantial learning came in the place of that tincture of Latin which the religious orders had supplied.

This discre- tion was left to his majesty by the act ; otherwise, the property of all monasteries with an income of less than two hundred a year went to the crown.

In this chapter our attention has been directed to such of its measures as affected the position of the English clergy, and the relation of England to the papal see. Its great work lay in this direction \u2014 and a great work was done. We have seen how the spiritual courts were reformed; how the jurisdiction of the prelates was restrained and narrowed ; how the legislative authority of the houses of convocation was brought to an end ; how the clergy were made subject to the court of the magistrate in common with the laity ; how the magistrate was made to act as a check on all spiritual persons in their dealing with charges of heresy; how the same strong hand was extended, first to the limitation, and finally to the extinction, of the papal power in its relation to this country ; how the act against appeals to Rome, under any plea what- soever, was followed by acts against money contribu- tions in any form to the papal treasury ; how being shut out from all authority on English ground, and from all access to English wealth, the papal authority itself was at length openly disowned, the bishop of * 27 Hen.

So far, Wycliffe or Oldcastle would have looked on with gratitude and wonder. But much remained to be done. We call this But much parliament the Reformation Parliament, because its beTo'ne\u2014 '\u00b0 ecclesiastical reforms were many and memorable ; but it was not a Protestant parliament. It grave the ism- not of Protect nation ecclesiastical independence. It removed a antism. heavy weight of ecclesiastical oppression from the mind of the people, so that they began to breathe anew. But, in its own estimation, it remained itself Catholic, and the nation was to remain Catholic, even when separated from the great centre of Catholicism. Its resolve was, to purify the religion of the country, and to secure its independence \u2014 with the concurrence of the see of Rome, if that should be possible, without it, if that should be impossible. In those days, the Catholic powers of Europe were the conformists, the Protestants were the nonconformists, and Henry, and many of his friends, seemed to feel that England would lose status by withdrawing itself from the rank of the former, and taking place with the latter. Hence, in the greatest heat of their innovations, the commons protest, as we have seen, against being regarded as intending to separate themselves from Catholic Christendom. As if to give emphasis to such lan guage, Sir Thomas More and the bishops were allowed to gratify their taste for persecution on a large scale \u2014 the same breath sending forth angry messages to Rome, and sentences which made Protestantism heresy, and sent its disciples to the stake. In 1529, the year in which this parliament was convened, Henry issued a proclamation in which eighty-five works, the production of English or continental reformers, from Wycliffe downwards, were condemned, under their re spective titles ; and the year following, a Protestant"], [244, "222 NATIONALISTS AND ROMANISTS.

These people rejected the doctrine of transubstantiation, and spoke of infant baptism as of no efficacy. This last opinion had become so con nected in the minds of men with ideas of social dis organization and immorality, that these friendless strangers \u2014 innocent enough no doubt of the impurity or treason accounted as natural to their creed \u2014 appear to have passed through their dreadful ordeal without an eye to pity them, and leaving scarcely a hand to give us a record of their fate.f The reader has seen that in 1536 Henry would fain have strengthened his position by forming a league with the Lutherans \u2014 pity that such an effort should have come so late, and that it should have been so inadequate to its object when it did come. It will be seen that, so far, the struggle upon the surface has been a struggle between Nationalists and Romanists. But there is a more religious element beneath, which will make itself felt both above and below, in its season. The following passage from the instructions placed in the hands of the visitors of the monasteries, and which was no doubt from the pen of Cromwell, is much above the ordinary level of thought in those times, and promises well for the country in which statesmen could learn so to express themselves \u2014 ' That ' the abbot, prior, or president shall every day expound ' to his brethren, as plainly as may be in English, ' a certain part of the Rule which they have pro ' fessed, and apply the same always to the doctrine of ' Christ, and not contrary wise, and shall teach them that ' their ceremonies and other observances of religion * Strype's Memorials, i. 253-256. f Stow's Chronicle, $ji."], [245, "223 THE REFORMATION PARLIAMENT.

But more than three years book vij had now passed since that object had been fully Chap 4' realized. Ardent lovers do not always make steady husbands. The king was much changed, and had now learnt to look on Jane Seymour, a lady of the court, whom he afterwards married, as no married man should look on a second woman. Some occa sional misunderstandings, and collisions of feeling, such as often come up in married life, appear to have taken place between him and the queen. The effect of such differences, in most cases, is not a serious matter. In this instance it was otherwise. Before the day of the tournament at Greenwich, Henry and Anne had become mutually jealous. How far the conduct of Anne had been such as to warrant this feeling on the part of her husband, is the question which historians have had to solve, and which they have solved very differently. Enemies of Anne Bo leyn, who were no doubt enemies also of the Refor mation, had probably succeeded in fixing injurious im pressions on the mind of the king.* During the fortnight before the gathering at Green- Proceedings wich, a secret commission had been busily occupied mission in collecting evidence relating to alleged improprieties J^J anV on the part of the queen. So weighty were the pro- flve gemie ceedings contemplated as the result of these inquiries, that writs were suddenly issued for a new parliament. The festival at Greenwich was on a Monday. On the Thursday preceding, Sir William Brereton, of the king's household, had been sent to the Tower. On Sunday, Mark Smeton, a musician, who had been for some time about the court, had been sent to the same custody. Immediately after the festival on Monday, Sir Henry Norris, Sir Francis Weston, and lord Rochfort found themselves prisoners. These were all young men.

Anne, who had gone unsuspectingly to the May-day scene at Greenwich, left it under arrest, and appeared the next morning before the privy council to answer questions touching the charges preferred against her \u2014 charges which embraced adultery, incest, conspiracy, and treason.* Necessary j^ should be remembered at this point, that when invUe*tiga-\"s it was resolved to institute this official investigation, tI0\"' Anne Boleyn was in effect no longer queen. What- ever the righteous issue of such a scrutiny might have been, a woman upon whom the shadow of such sus- picions had fallen, could never again receive the homage of the throne. The undoubted sacredness, the sort of divinity, that must hedge about a woman in that high place was gone. The real, and the only question, accordingly, which remained to be settled was \u2014 how to displace this poor child of fortune most effectually, and with the least hazard to public feeling. Endeavours In accordance with this view, there is one marked accuse! \" feature in these proceedings which it becomes the confess40 reader to observe. It is manifest that Henry hoped to bring this grave business to a speedy issue by in- ducing the accused parties to confess themselves guilty under the promise of pardon. This course was tried with Norris by the king in person, and his majesty made more than one effort of the same kind, as we shall see, with the queen herself. In this case, as in all similar cases, to know the policy of the king, was to know the course which would be sure to be taken by his instruments. All the persons accused were made aware that their only chance of escape from the dreadful penalties of treason was by admitting the charges against them. This policy, we think, implies a want of such decisive evidence as the course to which the king had committed himself required. * Constantyne's Memorial to Cromwell, Arch\u0153ologia, xxiii. 64.

The president osVnnT'* was the duke of Norfolk, uncle to the queen. Norfolk Bolt>'n and Gardiner were strongly opposed to the contem plated league between Henry and the Lutherans. They looked with much more pleasure towards a pos sible reconciliation with Rome and with the emperor ; and such a counter revolution they were willing to regard as practicable, if Henry could somehow be divorced from Anne, and this obnoxious marriage be thus set aside. f And certainly there was enough in * Constantyne's Mem. 64. ' On the first of May the king sent for Norris, and said, if he would confess those things with which the queen was charged, he should neither suffer in person nor in estate, nor so much as be put in prison. But if he did not confess, and were found guilty, he should suffer the extremity of the law. Norris answered he would much rather die than be guilty of such falsehood ; it was all false.' \u2014 Burnet, Hist. iii. 203, 204. t ' I would wish that he [the earl of Surrey] should be one to be sent thither [to negotiate with the Lutherans] ; for there he should be fully in structed of God's word and of experience.

Some years later, the duke was known to say, ' I never read the scripture, and never will read it ; it was merry in England afore the new learning came up ; yea, I would all things were as hath been in times past.' \u2014 Froude, iv. 106. In 1 1543, the duke was at the head of an intrigue in the council against Cranmer. The morning had come in which the archbishop was to have been arrested at the council table, sent to the Tower, and made to pay the penalty of his fondness for religious novelties. Henry allowed the duke and his zealots to take their course, but interposed at the last moment to save the primate. When rebuked by the king, Norfolk's hypocrisy and mendacity allowed him to say, * We meant no manner of hurt unto my lord of Canterbury, that we requested to have him in durance ; which we ody did because he might, after his trial, be set at liberty to his greater glory'l \u2014 Strype's Cranmer, i. 180. Yet we know scarcely a man among the peers at that time of a better moral standing than Norfolk ; not a few of them, we have reason to fear, would have suffered in comparison with him.

In other words, the duke was there, not as the uncle, but as the politician, prepared to receive a confession of guilt, but to be little patient of anything beside.* The four Brereton, Weston, Norris, and Rochfort, all pleaded plead no*t not guilty, though they must have known that to do gmlty' so was to give themselves into the hands of the exe- cutioner. Norris, indeed, after the strongest protests as to the queen's innocence, was prevailed on by the council, and by the hope of pardon, to make some con- fession of fault.

In these pro ceedings so far, we trace the presence of a wisdom which is too clearly a wisdom of this world. The case of the four commoners was of course a case Trial of tin to be decided by juries. They were accordingly tried monersT by juries, both in Kent and Middlesex, the offences charged upon them being said to have been committed in both counties. By a jury, in both instances, they were all pronounced guilty. The indictment presented The indict against them was specific as to time and place. The crimes imputed to Norris and Brereton date as far back as the i rth of October and the 25th of December, in 1533 > those imputed to Weston and Smeton date from April aud May in the following year. So that the first offence, according to this document, took place within a year after the queen's marriage, and just a month before the birth of the princess Elizabeth ! Two years had elapsed, at the time of this prosecution, since the date of the last alleged delinquency. If evidence what was existed on these points, so direct and specific as was d[ea^'f affirmed, in 1536, it must have existed in 1534 and in 1533. And can we suppose that a secret knowledge of such matters, possessed not only by the paramours, who are described as bitterly jealous of each other, but, as the evidence supposes, by third persons, and by many such persons, could have remained a secret so long? These considerations dispose us to ask with much interest, what the evidence really was on which these juries proceeded to their verdict. But here our lights no evidence fail us lamentably. These memorable state trials were appar' the trials of men under the gravest possible charges, such as could not fail to awaken public curiosity, and to furnish men everywhere with talk. The indictment, indeed, not only attributes great crimes to Anne Boleyn, but mentions circumstances and dates.

But, in fact, this document, in Chap' 4' place of proving her guilty, furnishes decisive evidence, in our judgment, that she must have fallen by a foul \u2022 conspiracy. To suppose that Anne Boleyn indulged in the licentious freedoms with the persons of her alleged lovers, to seduce them to her pleasure, which are described in this indictment, and that she did all this in the presence of third parties, must be to suppose her bereft of reason. In the case of the four gentle- men, if there were not third parties to be witnesses, there could have been no witnesses. The evidence, in fact, is of the sort which destroys it\u00bbelf by being out- rageously overdone. Bersons who could credit it for a moment, must have been prepared to credit anything.

On entering her room in the Tower, ' She fell ' down on her knees, and prayed God to help her, as ' she was not guilty of the thing for which she was ' accused.' She felt it a sad grievance that at such a moment the ladies in whom she had been wont to con fide had been put away from her, and that only such as were not friendly to her should be placed about her. And it is a significant circumstance, that one of the ladies thus unacceptable to her, and who was ap pointed to sleep in her chamber, was her aunt, the duchess of Norfolk. The duke of Norfolk, and some members of the council, waited upon her, and in the hope of bringing her to confession, told her that Norris and Smeton had acknowledged the charges against them. But no admission of her guilt could be drawn from her. On the contrary, she declared to Kingston, the lieutenant of the Tower, that she was the king's wedded wife, and had never been unfaithful to him.* But Anne Boleyn, unlike the late queen Catherine, Temper*. was a woman swayed by impulse. Her thoughts and Anne no passions soon came to the surface, and found utter- ance in words ; and a mind never well balanced was [!\u00b0\"\"lllinB all but unhinged by the stunning transition through which she had now passed. She was alternately buoyant and depressed, wept and laughed, and talked very incoherently. The report of the confession said to have been made by Norris and Smeton affected her greatly ; and she fell into conversation with a Mrs. Cosins, as a more cautious and artful woman would never have done, about what had really taken place between herself and those persons. Mrs. Cosins inquired why * Burnet, i. 362. Kingston's Letters to Cromwell in Singer's Ca vendish. Strype's Mem. i. 43 1 et seq."], [254, "232 NATIONALISTS AND ROMANISTS. BOOK VI Chap. 4. What is disclosed by these con- versations, there should have been any talk between her and Norris about love matters. ' Marry/ said Anne, ' I ' bade him do so, for I asked him why he did not go ' on with his marriage/ who replied that ' he would ' yet tarry some time / to which I answered, ' You ' look for dead men's shoes ; for if aught come to the 'king but good, you would look to have me.' Norris rejoined that, ' if he had any such thought, he would ' his head were cut off/ on which Anne said, * I told ' him that I could undo him if I pleased, and therefore ' I fell out with him.' Of Smeton she said, that he had never been in her bedchamber but once, which was when the king was last at Winchester, and then he had come in to play the virginals. ' She never ' spoke to him after that, but on Saturday before May ' day, when she saw him standing in the window, and ' then she asked him why he was so sad ; he said it ' was no matter ; she answered, you may not look to ' have me speak to you as if you were a nobleman.' ' No, no, madam,' said he, ' a look has sufficed me ; ' fare ye well.' Anne further said, that on the last Whitsuntide, Weston had observed to her ' that ' Norris came more to her chamber on her account, ' than for anybody else that was there. She had ' observed that he loved a kinswoman of hers, and ' challenged him for it, and for not loving his wife. ' But he answered her that there were women in the ' house whom he loved better than both ; she asked \u2014 ' Who is that ? Yourself, said he ; upon which she said ' she defied him.'* These conversations, it must be borne in mind, do not come through channels friendly to the queen, nor all at first hand. The documents containing them, moreover, are only partially legible, and it is evident that this Mrs. Cosins, and all the persons near the queen, were placed there to do service to her pro secutors. But we must suppose that words somewhat * Singer's Cavendish. Strype, Mem. i. 430-436."], [255, "233 REFORMATION AND THE SIX ARTICLES. to the above effect were uttered ; and the disclosures book vi. they make as to what could take place between the CaAr' f queen and such persons, are sufficient to explain how affairs may have come into their present posture. But, in our opinion, the front of the offending chargeable on Anne Boleyn will be found in this want, not only of the dignity of demeanour proper to a queen, but of that prudent self-respect which should be found in every married woman. We have no evidence against her like that supplied by her own language ; and that language, while betraying much which it is painful to read, does not imply guilt \u2014 especially when viewed in connexion with the strong and unvarying terms in which she asserts her innocence. Cranmer was much indebted to the queen. He had Cnmmerts also the highest opinion of her worth, and was deeply the mvesti interested in the ecclesiastical reforms which hadgatl0n' become associated with her name. Care had been taken, accordingly, to keep him out of these proceed ings, until the investigation should be complete, and the course to be taken should be settled. On the day after the arrest of the queen at Greenwich, the arch bishop received a message from Cromwell, requiring him not to be absent from his palace until he should hear further from the king. By this time rumours of all sorts were abroad. On the following morning, unable to remain longer silent, Cranmer wrote his memorable letter to Henry. It was a perilous thing to seem to oppose a course to which his majesty ap peared to be committed. But the best that he could do to serve the friendless queen, without incurring the displeasure of the angry king, was done. Here are some of his words : ' I am in such a perplexity that ' my mind is clean amazed. For I never had better h\u00ab letter ( opinion in woman than I had in her ; which maketh Opinion8 ' me to think that she could not be culpable. And \u00b0\u2122\u00a3 ' again, I think your highness would not have gone so ' far unless she had surely been culpable. Now, I ' think that your grace best knoweth, that, next unto"], [256, "234 NATIONALISTS AND ROMANISTS. ' your grace, I was most bound unto her of all * creatures living. Wherefore I most humbly beseech ' your grace to suffer me in that which God's law, ' nature, and also her kindness bindeth me unto ; that ' is, that I may, with your grace's favour, wish and ' pray for her that she may declare herself inculpable ' and innocent. I loved her not a little for the love I ' judged her to bear towards God and his gospel ; so, ' if she be proved culpable, there is not one that loveth ' God and his gospel that ever will favour her.'* It so happened, that before this letter was sent to the king, the chief members of the cabinet invited Cranmer to a meeting in the Star Chamber. In that interview they made known to the primate such things as the king thought should not be kept from him. As the result, Cranmer adds, in a postscript to the letter \u2014 ' I am exceedingly sorry that such faults ' can be proved by [against] the queen, as I heard of ' their relation.' The case, as stated, was no doubt a bad one. How far the statements made were trust worthy Cranmer had no direct means of judging.f On the Friday of the week in which the queen was sent to the Tower, Henry wrote to her, or sent her a message, holding out the promise of forgiveness, if she would confess the truth \u2014 that is, if she would confess herself guilty. This called forth a letter in reply, which has become an important historical document. In this letter, Anne begins by observing, that if the overture which the king had made to her had been really friendly, it would hardly have been made through a person who was her known enemy ; that in regard to confessing the truth, she was quite prepared so to do, but that the truth in her case must be that she was an innocent and a deeply-injured wife ; that inasmuch as it had been purely his fancy that had raised her from so humble a station to a throne, she had always feared that some other object would come BOOK VI.

The king, she said, had raised her to much honour on earth, and now, by her martyrdom, would raise her to the place of a saint in heaven ! t Nothing could have been more natural than the language of these documents, if we suppose the queen to have been innocent. Nothing more unnatural, supposing her to have been guilty. The tone of ex pression, and the allusions, are such as might well come from a heart too full from its sense of injury to be governed by great caution, even where life itself was concerned. The trial of the queen and of her brother should Trial of \"ie have taken place before the house of peers. But it was decided that the place of meeting should be the Tower, and that the whole house should not be sum moned. The number of peers present was twenty- seven.

BOOK VI, Chap. 4. The queen before her judges. Opinion of men who heard the evidence. Sentence pronounced single person friendly to her interest. The most sedulous efforts had been made by the government for weeks past to array evidence against her, but not the slightest facility would seem to have been per mitted for the production of evidence on the other side. The queen, accordingly, fell, alone and power less, into the hands of her prosecutors, from the mo ment of her arrest at Greenwich, to that in which she rose in the presence of this commission of peers as her judges. Such, in fact, was the dismay which the known will of the court had produced, that it mani festly paralysed all opposition. Unhappily, the terrors of power have wrought such effects too often in his tory to allow of our being greatly amazed at them in this instance. The people had their thoughts and their utterances about these proceedings, but there was not a man of any position whose soul did not seem to be scared into speechlessness, and dwarfed below the level of manhood, by the known intention of the government. When the queen entered the hall in which the peers were assembled, she appeared without an ad vocate, and without a single male attendant. She took the chair which had been provided for her, and bent courteously, and with apparent cheerfulness, to several of the noblemen near her, retaining, even in that humbled state, the manner which became her as queen. The indictment setting forth her alleged guilt was read. The queen's reply to this impeachment was in few words ; but we learn from reliable autho rity, that ' both the city magistrates, and several ' others who were there, said, they saw no evidence ' against her : only it appeared they were resolved to be ' rid of her! * The peers, when questioned concerning their ver dict, all answered guilty.

BOOK VI. Chap. 4. Execution of the four gentlemen. She had grown jealous of her husband's affection for his sister, and was said to have dropped much evil in the hearing of the king. Bochfort's guilt was so improbable, that there was heavy betting in favour of his being acquitted.* Two days after the trial of the queen, Bochfort, Brereton, Weston, and Norris were beheaded. Boch fort asserted his innocences The other three had pleaded not guilty, and they never recalled that plea. On the scaffold they restricted themselves to vague confessions of sinfulness, which by some was inter preted suspiciously. But others were heard to say, that if the gentlemen had been guilty, the confession would surely have come out at last. Anne spoke of their death as a sufficient vindication of her good name. It was one of the very bad features of those times, that state criminals were controlled by the terrors of the government even in sight of the block. More and Fisher, the last men we might have supposed to have been thus influenced, allowed their conduct at the place of execution to be dictated by the power which sent them to their doom. In cases of treason, it rested with the crown to say whether the punishment should be by decapitation, or by the degrading and barbarous process of hanging and quartering ; and to determine also whether the families of the victims should inherit their name and property, or be reduced to infamy and poverty. To have died protesting against the course of the government, would have been construed as a defiance. Braises of the king upon the scaffold, accordingly, were so common in this reign, says Sir Henry Ellis, as to suggest that they must have been 'directed by the government.'!

' If juries,' says one of the wisest and most trustworthy authorities of the times, ' do pro ' nounce not guilty upon the prisoner, against whom ' manifest witness is brought in, the prisoner escapeth; ' but the twelve are not only rebuked by the judges, but ' also threatened to punishment, and many times com ' manded to appear in the Star Chamber, or before the ' privy council, upon the matter.

Constantyne's Memorial, which I have more than once cited, is a document in which the writer professes to send to Cromwell the substance of certain conversations in which he was said to have spoken dangerous things. He is justly described by his editor (153) as a ' shrewd, bustling, intriguing' person. He had practised as a surgeon in Brabant, had subsequently taken holy orders, and was servant to Sir Henry Norris at the time of his arrest. But he learnt nothing from his master, or from any other source, about the queen's affair, beyond common rumour. He was present, however, when Norris and the other \"entlemen were executed, and as they did not repeat the assertion of their innocence on that occasion, he appears to have thought them guilty.

The power which dictated false judgments after this manner, was regarded as the power which virtually delivered such judgments. Cranmer saw the queen the day after her trial, as her confessor. The feeling of the archbishop was strongly on the side of saving the doomed life. In the course of confession, Anne was encouraged to make dis closures about a pre-contract of marriage, or something of that nature, before her marriage with the king. The primate appears to have seized on this communication, in the hope that, if a divorce might be founded upon it, the king, on being thus legally free to marry again, might possibly be disposed to spare the life of his victim. Certain it is, that a divorce was formally pronounced. In the then state of the law concerning engagements and marriages, Anne might have con fessed enough to give a colour of legality to a proceed ing of this nature, without having been in any serious degree culpable, f She appears to have had some ex pectation, that on the ground of this confession, the sentence passed upon her would be remitted, and she spoke to Cranmer of retiring to Antwerp. But what ever may have been the encouragement given to such hopes, they were to end in disappointment. It is not enough now that the king should be released from * Observations on the Statutes of the Reformation Parliament, by Andrew Amos, Esq. 167, 168. t It is possible that Anne understood her connexion with lord Percy as involving a contract, though his lordship, as earl of Northumberland, de clared on oath, and on the sacrament, that he had not so understood it.

What the wealth and taste of France could aV contribute towards the brilliancy of a court ceremonial CMl* and was to be seen then in the town of Boulogne ; and what rival splendour of that nature could be produced by England was to be seen in the town of Calais. Henry had his reasons at that juncture for wishing to have an interview with Francis, and the two kings were disposed to vie with each other in the extent and pomp of their equipage, and in the skilful invention of court pastimes. The great lady in the French court was the queen of Navarre, sister to the king ; the lady who filled that position in the English court was Anne Boleyn, now known as the marchioness of Bembroke. Our old chroniclers have shown how the rank and chivalry of France and England did its homage at that time to the lady, who, though not then queen of England, was the queen elect, and was recognised as such.* When six more months had passed, Anne and The corona\" Henry had been for some time married, and town m\u00b0ny.e'e' and country had become full of talk and bustle con cerning the approaching coronation of the new queen. Memorable was the holiday and sunshine of that season. The queen was at Greenwich when the pre parations for this grand spectacle were in process ; and never did the city companies seem more intent on throwing the splendour even of a Venice festival into The river the shade, than on the day when it was left to them to Gr\"em\u2122u escort Anne Boleyn upon the Thames from Greenwich to the Tower. Fifty barges dropped into their place, at * Hall, ad an. II R"], [264, "242 NATIONALISTS AND ROMANISTS. BOOK VI Chap. 4. given distances from each other, on the river, within sight of the palace, all with their flags and streamers floating in the air, with their gold and gay colouring everywhere about them, and sending forth peals of music, and shouts from merry voices. At three o'clock the queen made her appearance. She wore a dress brilliant with gold, and descended to the barge in waiting, with a train of ladies. Near to her person, in barges of their own, were many noble men and bishops. The minstrels now began to play, and the gay flotilla, extending far down the river, was put in motion. As the procession passed, the trading ships, moored up on either shore, greeted it with cheering and with cannon. In front of all was a vessel constructed in the form of a huge dragon, with the figures of wild men rising up from her sides. The dragon was kept always in motion, and dragon and men were made to send forth flame, and monstrous noises, as if to scare the very fish in the river out of the path of the great festive company at hand. Next came the barge of the mayor, on the left of which was another fancy vessel, exhibiting a white falcon crowned with a wreath of white and red roses on the summit of a mountain, with virgins indulging in music and play below. On the right floated what was called the bachelor's barge, which kept its place by the side of the queen, and which her majesty ' took great ' pleasure to behold.' For in this barge were trum peters, and others who played on pleasant instruments, while her decks, and sail-yards, and top-castles were all hung with costly draperies in silk and gold. On her foreship, also, at her stern, and on her castle-work, were flags with the arms of the king and queen skil fully wrought into them. On either side, thirty-six shields were seen, with their emblazonments, with many flags and banners, devised for the occasion by the company of Haberdashers and Merchant Adven turers. As the queen approached the Tower, a gun was fired, which gave a louder signal than had ever"], [265, "REFORMATION AND THE SIX ARTICLES. 243 been heard from those old walls. Anne landed at the book vi, water-stairs. There Henry met her and kissed her. Chap' 4' The queen made acknowledgment in fitting words to the mayor and the companies for their good service. None, we are told, who were not present at that sight, could imagine the multitudes of people that were brought together to behold it. The spectacle through the city did not take place The city until more than a week later. When it came it was spectac e' found to be even more gorgeous and elaborate than the display on the Thames. The streets leading from the Tower to Temple Bar were all overlaid with gravel. One side was railed off, and within that rail the city companies were marshalled, extendingfromGracechurch street, where the ancient Stillyard men stood in their order, to the end of Cheapside, where the aldermen had their place. The opposite line along those streets was fenced off by a chain of constables, all carrying staves, and dressed in silk and velvet. The mayor, clothed in a crimson velvet gown, and otherwise richly decorated, rode to the Tower to tender his services to the queen. The sheriffs accompanied the mayor on this errand, and his lordship was attended by two foot- men in white and red damask. The sheriffs then returned, mounted their horses, and placed themselves at the head of the force expected to ensure order. Before her majesty left the Tower, Gracechurch-street and Cornhill were hung with scarlet, crimson, and other variegated cloths, and in some places with rich arras, tapestry and carpeting ; and along the greater part of Cheapside, the houses were made brilliant with many of the richest productions which the looms of that age could furnish, while all the windows were filled with ladies and gentlemen, and every available place for seeing what all were intent to see was crowded with the populace. In the procession, the first place was ceded to twelve gentlemen in attendance on the French ambassador. The trappings to the horses of these gentlemen were r 2"], [266, "244 NATIONALISTS AND ROMANISTS. BOOK VI. ClIAP. 4. The corona tiou. of blue sarsenet, powdered with white crosses. They wore themselves tunics of blue velvet, with sleeves of yellow and blue. In the train of these equestrians followed their knights and esquires, two and two. Then came the judges, the knights of the Bath, abbots, barons, bishops, earls, and marquises ; then the arch bishop of York and the Venetian ambassador ; the archbishop of Canterbury and the French ambassador ; and then the mayor of London, followed by the earl marshal, and by the high constable of England. Nearly all these noblemen and lords were draped in crimson velvet ; and all the queen's servants, and officers in arms, appeared in scarlet. Immediately before her majesty, rode the chancellor, uncovered. Then came the queen, the great object of interest, \u2014 young, beau tiful, graceful in all her recognitions of the popular feeling. She rode in an open car, overlaid in all parts with white and gold, drawn by two palfreys, with white damask housings dropping from their heads to their feet, and led by footmen. The queen wore a dress of white cloth of tissue, and a mantle of the same, fringed with ermine. Over her head a superb canopy was borne, which was committed to the care of sixteen knights ; the knights discharging their duty in rotation, four at a time. Then came many chariots with ladies of the court ; and then, as the pageant passed from point to point along the given path, schoolboys re cited verses, and companies exhibited their emblematic shows by the aid of a curious mechanism. At length, the queen reaches the great hall at Westminster, and there returns her thanks to the people for the manner in which they had shown their good affection to her sovereign lord and to herself.* All this took place on the Saturday, and the cere mony to which all this was only preliminary was fixed for the following day. Between eight and nine o'clock on that morning, the magnates of the city, and the * Hall, 798-802."], [267, "REFORMATION AND THE SIX ARTICLES. 245 splendour of the court, had come together in West- book vi minster Hall, where the queen stood for awhile under Chap 4' a cloth of state. A path leading through the palace and the sanctuary to the high altar in the abbey had been railed off and laid with cloth. Along that path, monks and abbots, judges and knights, prelates, am bassadors, and nobles, move again in their order. The canopy over the queen is borne by four wardens of the cinque ports. Her dress is a robe of purple velvet, the train of which is borne by the bishops of London and Winchester. On her head is a white circlet, glittering with precious stones. Then come her long train of ladies. From a chair near the choir she is led to the high altar, where she kneels while Cranmer read certain offices, and being conducted again to the elevation provided for her, the crown of St. Edward is rested on her brow, a sceptre of gold is placed in her hand, and then all the quire sing Te Deum* Such was the taste of England in such matters Fast and under the house of Tudor, and such to Anne Boleyn prei was the May of 1533. We have just seen what the May of 1 536 was to bring to her. In the May of the latter year, there was a spectacle at Greenwich, and a voyage from Greenwich to the Tower. But the sequel of the later holiday was an arrest, not a coronation ; and the next landing at those water-stairs, was not to be under the eyes of the jubilant multitude Anne had once seen there, but in the presence of a few old faces wonderfully changed, and without a single heart to which she could look for the help needed in that hour of agony. In her state of sudden alarm and un certainty, she feared that she might be sent to some dungeon cell ; but, to relieve her from that feeling, she was informed that the apartments allotted to her were those she had occupied at her coronation.

The same again \u2014 and yet how little the same ! Anne Boleyn is condemned, confessed, divorced, \u2014 she has only to die. Knowing this, she sent for Kingston, the constable of the Tower, to be present when she took the sacra ment, and to hear her speak concerning her innocence. She said to that officer, ' I hear say I shall not die ' afore noon, and I am very sorry therefore, for I ' thought to be dead by this time, and past my pain.' I totd her there would be no pain, it was so subtle, and then she said, ' I heard say the executioner is very ' good, and I have a little neck/ she added, putting her hands about it, and smiling. ' I have seen many ' men, and also women, executed,' said the constable, ' and they have been in great sorrow ; and to my ' knowledge this lady hath much joy and pleasure in ' death.'* It was arranged that the place of execution should be the greensward within the Tower wall, not on Tower Hill. Nor were the public more than partially admitted. But the city magistrates were there, with some gathering of people ; and the duke of Bichmond, the duke of Suffolk, the chancellor, and Cromwell, are said to have been upon the scaffold. The queen ascended that platform, and passed to the front with a firm step. Under admonition, or from the prompting of her solicitude in behalf of her daughter Elizabeth, she appears to have determined that her last words should not be words of accusation. With a cheerful countenance, and an unfaltering voice, she said : \u2014 ' Christian people, I am come to die ; and according ' to law, and by law, I am judged to death, and there ' fore I will speak nothing against it. I am come ' hither to accuse no man, nor to speak anything of that ' iv hereof I am accused and condemned to die. * Kingston to Cromwell Singer, 461."], [269, "REFORMATION AND THE SIX ARTICLES. 247 ' But I pray God to save the king, and send him book vi, ' long to reign over you, for a gentler and more merciful Chap 4' ' prince was there never, and to me he was ever a good, ' a gentle, and a sovereign lord.

To Christ I ' commend my soul. Jesus receive me.' Then the stroke was given \u2014 and that great gun, which had once told all London and the country round, that the queen had placed her foot in state upon the Tower stairs, now told to that city and country what had befallen the head that had worn a crown ! The body and the head of Anne Boleyn, the queen of England, were ' thrown into a common chest of elm tree, made to ' put arrows in,' and were thus buried before twelve o'clock in the chapel within the Tower, f So did pageantry and tragedy succeed each other in Gumy or the history of Anne Boleyn. Even if Henry believed not gu'Uy ' her guilty, his course towards her was such as might well cause humane men to blush for their manhood. But we have yet to learn that he had a right to think her guilty. She had indeed shown herself to be want ing in the sense of dignity becoming her exalted station, and even in good womanly discretion. But Henry himself was not, in any view, a man of refine ment. The coarseness of his feeling was often patent to every one. He was not a man to have a right to complain of some want of delicacy in a woman so much under his own influence.

BOOK VI. Chap 4. one colour to all things. His determination to marry Anne Boleyn, in preference to any other woman, was the result, as the queen intimates, of a mere fancy. It rested on no principle ; and when the charm of such an attachment should pass away, as pass away it pro- bably would, it was to be expected that there would be a desire of change. Henry's passion for Jane Sey- mour disposed him to listen to tales against Anne Boleyn, and the rest followed. It is true, said Sir Thomas More, his majesty is very gracious with me, but if my head would give him another castle in France, it would not be long before it disappeared.* This witness is true. The character of the man is in that \"utterance concerning him. To see the sovereign of a great people deliver his wife into the hands of the headsman, would, in any circumstances, have been sufficiently revolting. But that such a course should have been taken upon evidence which so manifestly refuted itself, is a chapter in the history of human nature, which, happily, has few parallels. But what are we to say of the ministers, the juries, the convoca- tion of peers, who all gave the king their assistance in so doing ? We can only say that they did in this case as they did in too many beside. Henry had been a humoured and spoiled piece of royalty from his boyhood upwards. It may be men- tioned, also, as a further misfortune to him, that through his whole reign his life continued to be so precious to his people, that they were prepared to sus- tain him under any endurable maladministration of his power. The earnest religious men of the country, regarded him, with all his faults, as the great stay between them and the consuming tyranny of Borne. f The Nationalists, at the same time, never ceased to * Cayley's Life of More, 9 1 . t George Constantyne was a sort of Lutheran, and, speaking of the king, he says, ' What matter for my life, or twenty thousand such, for the preservation of his life.' \u2014 ' It grieved me at the heart to see his grace halt so much on his sore leg.' \u2014 Memorial, 75, 76."], [271, "REFORMATION AND THE SIX ARTICLES. 249 BOOK VI Chap. 4. look on him as the representative and security of their cause. While to the intelligence of the country generally, it was abundantly clear, that if anything should happen to him, there might at once be disputes about the succession, civil wars, and miseries such as no man could anticipate without horror. Some kings would have made a good use of the extraordinary powers which passed thus into the hands of this monarch. But it was in the nature of Henry that he should often make the worst use of such advan tages. The need of his presence was the great secret of submission to his oppressive rule. Concerning the experience which might be expected to come to ministers of state when they ceased to do the pleasure of the crown, sufficient warning had been given in the fate of Wolsey and of Sir Thomas More.* The resistance of juries in state prosecutions was hardly to have been expected, when the modest hesi tancies of cabinet ministers, and even of devout pre lates, could be dealt with in such fashion. The peers, in common with the juries, seem to have soothed their conscience with the thought, that there had been in discretion, if not sin; and that any sentence they might pronounce would leave it with the king to de termine the punishment proper to the case ; and what could be more safe than to leave the penalty that should be borne by a wife, to be adjudged by her hus band ? Such sniffings of responsibility are among the most common devices of humanity. Among all the parties who were concerned in bringing Anne Boleyn to the block, there was not a man who did not see, that any attempt to save the head of that victim would be made at the hazard of his own. It is no doubt true that men even in those times should have been * Roper informs us that the duke of Norfolk, expostulating with More, said \u2014 ' By the mass, Mr. More, it is perilous striving with princes ; there fore I would wish you somewhat to incline to the king's pleasure, for, by God's body, Mr. More, indignatio principis mors est.'

They could face any foe in the field ; but to face the frown of power nearer home in that resolved temper, was left to those more religious men whom that class of reli gionists were often busy in sending to the dungeon, the rack, and the stake. In reality, the king had done all that was done ; and if anything more were needed to show the temper in which he had done it, we see it in what immediately followed. Henry wore white on the day of Anne's execution ; and is said to have hailed the sound of the Tower gun which told that the executioner had done his work, as the signal for starting his hounds at Epsom. On the following day, in conformity with the welcome advice of his council, and of the peers, he was married to Jane Sey mour. One of the first requisites in a courtier is to know how to anticipate the wishes of a sovereign. The pleasure of Henry in the society of his new queen was soon overshadowed by the death of the duke of Bichmond, his natural son, to whom he was much attached. As the autumn advanced, the great northern insurrection broke upon him. The little cloud in the horizon soon became a tempest, wide and dark. The discontents in which this movement originated were various ; but the recent ecclesiastical changes, and especially the suppression of the monas teries, were the great matters of complaint. The historical significance of the rising, known, from its religious character, under the name of ' Bilgrimage of ' Grace,' is considerable. Cromwell appears to have had a special share in the resentment of the insurgents. He had encouraged the impious ecclesiastical innovations. He had caused the alienation of the abbey lands. He had dispersed the monks. By putting an end to the abbey charities he had produced a wide state of mendicancy. Certain hard ships which had come from the government proceed ings about tenures, and from the old policy of the"], [273, "251 REFORMATION AND THE SIX ARTICLES. BOOK VI Chap. 4. The out break in Lincoln shire. gentry in enclosing common lands, and in absorbing small farms into greater, were all laid to his charge. The grievances of the people, in many forms, were sufficient to justify discontent. But to the real faults of the government, the malcontents added faults that did not belong to it. Living in the midst of so much manifest change, they had become apprehensive of change without limit. If the abbeys could be sup pressed, why should the cathedrals and the parish churches be thought secure ? To account for the strength of such feeling in the north, it should be remembered that clergy and laity, rich and poor, in those parts, were iu a condition of rudeness and isolation unknown in the south. The first sign of disorder was at Louth, in Lincoln shire, where, on the arrival of some of Cromwell's com missioners, the people rose, and soon became a multi tude in arms. The furies in this movement were the priests, and the recently-ejected monks. But a large portion of the gentry became committed, willingly or unwillingly, to the enterprise. At the end of the third day from their rising at Louth, the men of Lin colnshire had reduced their demands on the govern ment to a series of written articles. These were \u2014 that the religious houses should be restored j that the subsidy lately imposed should not be raised ; that the firstfruits and tenths should be no more paid to the crown ; that the meddling with tenures according to the ' Statute of Uses' should be abandoned ; that low blood should have no place in the privy council ; and that the heretic bishops \u2014 meaning Cranmer, Latimer, and such men \u2014 should cease to be bishops, and be brought to due punishment. At a meeting in a field near Horncastle, where these articles were agreed to by acclamation, the chancellor of the diocese, who had been dragged from his sick bed, was exhibited on horse back. On seeing him, the ' parsons and vicars' greeted him with yells and groans, and amidst their cries of Kill him ! kill him !' the poor man was drawn from"], [274, "252 NATIONALISTS AND ROMANISTS. book vi. his horse, and, while upon his knees imploring mercy, C-AF' 4' was beaten to death with staves. His clothes were torn from his person and appropriated by the mur- derers.* piyTouT\" Henry replied to the demands of the rebels in demand of emphatic and haughty terms ; rebuking them for their presumption, in supposing that they knew more about the matters in question than himself and his parlia- ment ; and admonishing them, as they valued their lives, their goods, and the future of their families, to return at once to their allegiance. f Within a week, the infection of the revolt had so seized upon the people, that the men assembled are said to have amounted to between fifty and sixty thousand. Measures of Tn meanwhile, the king and the government the govern- ... \u00b0 .-r,. . ment\u2014 ioy. were prompt in their measures. The midland and south. e eastern counties were slow to move ; but the counties of the south and west \u2014 Middlesex, Kent, Surrey, Sussex, Buckinghamshire, Berkshire, Hampshire, Wilt- shire, and Gloucestershire \u2014 were ready the hour the summons reached them. Not more than eight days had passed since the disturbance at Louth, when the duke of Suffolk found that he had more loyal men at his disposal than he knew how to employ. And as the army of the government became strong in numbers, the army of the insurgents became weak through division, and other causes. The rising, though some- thing of the kind had been long intended, had taken place without concert. After a few days, provisions began to fail, and multitudes dropped away, and returned to their homes. The ground, moreover, on which the commons and the gentlemen engaged in the quarrel was considerably different, and jealousy soon Theinsur. rose up between them. Hence it happened, that presS\u00b0ed.sup\" within a fortnight, the Lincolnshire outrage had run its course.

So the insurrection was quelled, but the country remained full of sullen disaffection.* The news of Suffolk's success had scarcely reached R'sin? in London, when Cromwell received a despatch, bearing the inscription 'In haste, post, for thy life !' It told the minister that all Yorkshire was up, and with exactly the same cry that had been raised in Lincoln shire. Lord Darcy, who had the charge of the West Biding, had written in an indefinite and unsatisfactory manner. All was rumour. ' The matter hangeth yet 'like a fever, one day good, another bad.'f It was even so. Soon after the nightfall of the day on which Suffolk entered Lincoln, alarm-bells were heard peal ing from parish to parish over the length and breadth of Yorkshire. Signal lights were seen in the sky in all directions. From hill to hill beacon fires gave answer to each other. Most men knew what these signs meant. Some of the wiser heads regarded this action as premature. The moment was not favourable. It was a juncture when assistance was not to be ex pected from abroad. But the plans of the Yorkshire men were precipitated by what had taken place in Lincolnshire ; and the pent-up feeling becoming once outspoken, seemed to pass like a flood over the whole country. The few who were known as adherents to the government might well tremble for their safety. The great majority were loud in their denunciations of the men who had counselled the king to do grievous harm to the commonwealth ; to bring in many ' new ' inventions contrary to the faith of God / to rob the religious houses of their wealth, the plunder of the abbeys being, of course, only preparatory to a destruc- tion of the churches.

Measures of the king and the go, vernment. Such was the substance of an address which suddenly appeared on all church doors, and in all public places, bearing the signature of Bobert Aske. The person known by that name had come of a good Yorkshire family, of some standing, and honourably connected. He was a barrister, in practice as such in Westminster Hall, and was comparatively a young man. How his name came to be used thus early and thus prominently is somewhat of a mystery. According to his own account, he had been connected with the Lincolnshire rising through accident, and the Yorkshiremen pressed him into their service. However that may have been, when he had once put his hand to the undertaking, he stood prepared to hazard anything in its favour. The leadership in this perilous movement passed into his hands. The earl of Northumberland was sick and in his bed, and otherwise refused to be a party to these proceedings. But there was scarcely another name of any consideration in the north which was not, either by choice or force, committed to them. Truly formi dable in numbers, in organization, and in equipment was the enemy which declared itself willing to obey the orders of Bobert Aske, and which the men of rank were willing to see so commanded.* Henry saw the danger as it was. He knew that it menaced his throne. But his exertions were propor tioned to the exigency. Orders were issued to collect treasure by all available means. His own plate and jewels were offered as a contribution. f The duke of Norfolk, chief in command, was urged to move with caution. It would be better to retreat for awhile than to hazard an engagement where victory might be doubt ful. Every fortified place in Yorkshire, except the castle of Skipton, was in the hands of the insurgents, f * Froude, iii. 121 et seq. f State Papers, i. 478-484, 488.

Lord Darcy, lieutenant of the Chap 4' West Biding, had been found wanting. Nearly all men of similar position in those parts seemed to have followed these examples. Even Norfolk, though his loyalty might in the main be relied upon, was sus pected of being in sympathy with the men he was sent to subdue, especially on religious matters. The principal division of the rebel force was as- Meeting at sembled at Bomfret, and marched from that place to Doncaster. There the king's army was encamped. The followers of the duke did not exceed seven or eight thousand men. Aske, and the disaffected nobles, were at the head of four or five times that number. The river Don separated the two armies, leaving the bridge as the only point of communication. And now the question came to be, shall there be Negotia fighting, or shall there be negotiation ? Norfolk on the one side, and Aske on the other, were in favour of negotiation, and the scale turned in that direction. But no deliberation at Doncaster could be final. The insurgents, confident in their strength, proposed their terms without abatement. It was deemed prudent that these demands, extravagant as they were, should be sent to the king. Weeks now passed, and no answer was returned. Henry was then prevailed upon to grant an amnesty in full, and without exception, and to promise that a parliament should be assembled in Yorkshire in the course of the next summer. The king would meet the parliament, and the occasion should be graced with the coronation of the queen. Norfolk, who had brought the king to this conclusion with great difficulty, appears to have gone beyond his commission, and, intentionally or otherwise, led the insurgent that on the morrow they should see the ladies ' enforced by knaves' under the walls, and the children in front of a storming party, if they did not surrender. Happily, these religious warriors were foiled, for that night Christopher Aske, by a piece of most chivalrous daring, succeeded in effect ing a deliverance for the ladies and little ones. \u2014 Froude, iii. 140-142."], [278, "256 NATIONALISTS AND ROMANISTS. BOOK VI. Chat. 4. l'acifica tion. Fate of Darcy, Con stable. Aske, and others. delegates to believe that much more than had been directly promised might be expected. The armed men, having suffered much from the severe winter weather, had become desirous of home, and dispersed more or less satisfied.* The men who had been most conspicuous in this dangerous experiment were lord Darcy, Sir Bobert Constable, and Bobert Aske. The amnesty passed, Henry invited these persons to see him, that he might converse with them on what had happened. Con stable could not trust himself in the king's hands ; Darcy pleaded sickness ; but Aske, with the frank and honourable temper which characterized him, accepted the invitation.! Months, however, passed, and the pro mised changes came not. Cromwell was still in office. Henry was found to adhere pertinaciously to his ecclesiastical reforms. There was no prospect of the promised parliament and pageantries in Yorkshire. From these causes the minds of many were again unsettled. Treasonable things continued to be said and done. Sir Francis Bigod, who took no part in the former insurrection, was now weak enough to attempt something of the sort after his own fancy. In the confusion which ensued, new signs of disaffection were alleged against Darcy, Aske, Constable, and others, and all who were accused, with one exception only, were found guilty, j. Darcy was beheaded on Tower Hill ; Constable was hung in chains at Hull, the place of which he had been governor ; and A ske was dragged upon a hurdle through the streets of York to perish on the gallows. Such was the fate to which this remark able man, the great captain of the great insurrection, * State Papers, i. 493 et seq. -j- Ibid. i. 523-526.

Nor is it the crowd only that has fallen away. The stream has turned. Beer and gentleman, peasant and artisan, have gone back to their old courses of sport or toil as though nothing strange had happened. It was well, however, that the cause taken up by intention of these men was to prove a failure. Had they been gentses successful, their great work would have been to dis- fectostneir place some bad laws by much worse. The headsman would have had to do their bidding freely, and religious persecution would have become general. The fires of Smithfield would have been kindled about such victims as Cranmer and Latimer. Every good influence with which the English reformation was fraught would have been imperilled. From the preceding narrative it will be seen, that in 1536, Nationalism, to say nothing of real Bro testantism, was far from being everywhere ascendant in England. It will be seen, also, that the great reli gious revolution in process was, to a large extent, a question between north and south. But those who had been pledged to the reformation before, were now pledged to it treble-fold. What a new ascendancy of Bomanism would bring along with it, had been placed beyond doubt, by the proclamations and demands of the men of that faith in Lincolnshire and Yorkshire. With the summer of 1537 the north became quiet. Its lesson had been learnt, and was to be remembered. But the spirit of treason was still at work, and in quarters where the king had a right to expect a dif- * State Papers, i. 5S5~559- PrU3St to whom Aske made con fession writes to Cromwell, he said, ' that my lord privy seal [Cromwell] sundry times promised him a pardon of his life, and at one time he had a token from the king's majesty of pardon, for confessing the truth.

Margaret, countess of Salis- bury, sister to the unfortunate earl of Warwick, was generously treated by the Tudors \u2014 the more so, we may suppose, from an uneasy remembrance of the wrongs that had been done to her family.* Henry VII. gave her in marriage to a Welsh gentleman, named Bole, a distant relation of his own. Margaret was left a widow with four sons and two daughters, and she then withdrew from society, that she might devote herself to the careful training of her children. Begi- nald, her third son, was to become a conspicuous person in English history. In Oxford, he evinced a decided love of letters, and numbered Linacre and Latimer among his instructors. Henry VIII. was disposed to be even more liberal than his father toward Margaret and her children, and especially towards Beginald, from whose learning and ability much was expected. Writing to Henry at a later period, this distinguished representative of the house of York, said \u2014 ' Among all your nobility it was ' your pleasure to select me, that I should be carefully ' instructed in virtue and letters from my childhood. ' If my improvement has been small, the fault has ' been wholly mine, your kindness has assuredly been ' very great. No royal father could have done more ' in this way for his son.'f In 1520, when not more than nineteen years of age, Bole expressed a wish to prosecute his studies in Italy. Henry readily con- sented. But the young scholar was disposed to live expensively. Again and again he applied to Henry for means to defray the cost of his establishments, and the means were always granted. After an interval of five years, passed in associations where flattery in every form awaited him, Bole returned to England. J But the juncture was unfortunate. The divorce question soon came into general discussion. Henry naturally * See page 58. f Be Unit. Eccles. 1 20. X Beccatelli's Life of Pole."], [281, "REFORMATION AND THE SIX ARTICLES. 259 BOOK VI, CllAP. 4. hoped, that a man on whom he had lavished his patronage, would be found ready to further his wishes on a point to himself of so much interest. But he was disappointed. It has been affirmed that Bole secretly aspired to the hand of the princess Mary, and so to the throne itself.* The divorce, once carried, Mary would cease to be heir to the crown. But it must be remembered that Bole's residence in Italy had filled his mind with an enthusiastic admiration of everything papal, and with priestly notions of the most extreme complexion. It soon became manifest, that whatever may have been his motive, Bole had taken, not the National, but the Bomanist side on the divorce con troversy. That there might be no more uncertainty about his opinion on that point, Bole resolved, with his usual self-confidence, that he would see the king, and state to his majesty in person, his views, and the reasons of them. Henry, ignorant of the purpose of this visit, received him so cordially, that this sage monitor of his sovereign found it difficult to bring his tongue to perform the unwelcome office he had assigned to it. He, however, recovered his self-pos session, and said what he had meant to say. Henry was much moved, changed colour, fingered the dagger in his belt, as his manner was when excited, and said afterwards, that it was with great difficulty he had abstained from punishing the presumptuous ingrati tude of the man on the spot But he subdued his feeling, and dismissed his censor, saying he would think of what had been said, and give him an answer another times * Beccatelli's Life of Pole. + Beccatelli, 362. Pole, it seems, committed his thoughts on this subject to writing about the year 1530, and the paper was sent to Cran mer, by the earl of Wiltshire, for his judgment upon it. It is not known to have been seen by Henry. Cranmer's account of it is, that its author lacked judgment, hut that the argument was so eloquently set forth, that, if published, it would be assented to by most people. \u2014 Strype's Cranmer, c. a. Ap. 1. s 2"], [282, "260 NATIONALISTS AND ROMANISTS. BOOK VI. Chap 4. role's De Unitate Eccles. But the divorce came ; the measures of the Befor mation Barliament followed ; and then the indignation of Bole became full to overflowing. _ Henry appears to have had a sincere affection for this man, and to have looked upon him as a gifted, impulsive, inex perienced person, who should be borne with as far as possible. Even so late as 1536, two learned men were appointed to communicate with Bole in regard to the course of affairs in England, in the hope of bringing him to a more moderate way of thinking.* But Beginald Bole was a man to know little of mode ration. He was to see nothing but the hand of Satan in the changes which to so many intelligent and devout Englishmen were signs of the finger of God. Bole removed in 1532 from France to Italy, and until the summer of 1536 continued to subsist on the bounty of Henry, and to be in apparently friendly communication with him. It is a fact, however, that this subject of the king of England, living by his means, was eagerly engaged, at that time, in urging the pope and the emperor to an immediate adoption of the most hostile measures against his sovereign ; and that in the spring of 1535 he had finished the com position of that enormous libel upon Henry and his government, which was ultimately published under the title of the ' Unity of the Church.' Such was the nature of the correspondence between Bole and the agents of the king up to May, 1536, that they were hopeful, even then, of his being won over to the cause of their m aster. f But on the 23rd of that month, Bole's treatise was presented to the king, by the request of its author. And what was the purport of that treatise ? It regarded Henry as responsible for all the reforming measures of his parliament ; it de nounced all those measures as so many monster * Strype's Mem. i. Ap. Ixxx. t Ibid. i. 445 et seq. and App."], [283, "261 REFORMATION AND THE SIX ARTICLES. BOOK VI, CnAP. 4. crimes ; it declared that the king of England, by those Satanic proceedings, had forfeited all right to the crown, all claim upon the allegiance of his subjects, all place in the Christian Church, and all hope of the kingdom of heaven ; and it called upon all Christian potentates to proceed at once to the duty of deposing and punishing the grand delinquent, no work that could be done against Jew, Turk, or infidel being comparable in virtue to such a work against such an offender. Bole assured Henry that this treatise was a confi dential document, which no other eye had seen. But that statement he knew to be untrue. From his own letters, which show the traitor life he had been living for a long time past, it is clear that the work had been read by his friend Frioli, and by the cardinal Con tarini; that Bole himself had submitted it to the judgment of the pope, and at a time, moreover, when he knew the emperor to be in Borne. It is certain, also, that before the production ceased to be pro fessedly a private document, copies of it were known to be in the hands of official persons in Spain and in Flanders.* The whole cast of the composition, ad dressed as it is to the people and princes of Europe, as much as to Henry, abundantly shows, that it must have been intended from the first for the widest pos sible publicity. This the writer himself afterwards confessed. Whatever may have been Bole's con scientiousness, and it would be hard to suppose that he did not possess a strong feeling of that nature, it is manifest that it was not such as to secure him against a course of conduct characterized by insin cerity where the interests of his church were concerned, nor against utterances not in accordance with truth, f * Pol.

It is the more important to mark these facts, inas much as the injurious assertions in Bole's treatise have been regarded by a large class of writers as statements that could not have been addressed thus directly to the king if they had not been known to be true. Had these statements been all really so addressed the infe rence would not be warranted.* Bassionate men, when they find a story to their purpose, feel that such stories ought to be true, and Bole was a man of that tempera ment. His self-complacency and arrogance, moreover, were such as prompted him to say almost anything which it was agreeable to him to say, and to any persons. He was, in fact, one of a class of men who seem to think that they have been sent into the world to assume the tone of the infallible, and to bid other men give place to them.f So little capable was he of taking the place of an opponent, and of seeing with the eyes of such a person, that he rarely calculated with any tolerable accuracy on the effect likely to be produced by his own writings. He professed himself amazed that persons should see anything beyond a fitting expression of honest thought, in a work charged from beginning to end with the most rancorous assump tion and bigotry.

But hope, after awhile, became again ascendant No disciple of Origen could be more expert in wresting scripture to his purpose by means of a childish allegorizing, than this man who aspired to the great practical- work of governing churches and nations ; and no hill-side covenanter could be more free in making the facts of Old Testament history to speak in favour of the schemes of his church -militant, than this accomplished scholar, this high-bred church man.

So another attempt should be made against our revolted church and nation, and that would prevail.* It must be remembered that we have now reached the juncture when Bole's book, hitherto a manuscript, was to be printed, and, including its new infusions of slander and vituperation, was to be sent in great numbers from the printing presses of Borne to all parts of Christendom. Now, too, the pope was to abandon his affected forbearance towards the king of England, and his long-suspended denunciations were to be launched against the grand culprit in language hardly less outrageous than that of Bole himself. New * Epist. Reg. Pol. ii. 158 et seq."], [286, "264 NATIONALISTS AND ROMANISTS. BOOK VI, Chap. 4. attempts, moreover, were to be made to organize dis affection in England, simultaneously with new efforts to dispose Charles to become the invader of this devoted country. Bole was sent to Spain on this errand. Ireland, also, was to be at the same time in arms under the earl of Desmond, as viceroy to Charles or to his Holiness ; and the king of Scotland was to be the new Defender of the Faith, as the reward of his expected services in the conquest of England. But the government of England was in the hands of men who knew the character of the enemy against whom they had to keep their ground. The special hatred of Cromwell, avowed by Bole, and by all men of his class, was a natural result of the skill and success with which that statesman tracked the path of con spiracy, even in its most secret haunts. It was while the grand scheme above mentioned was in process, that the government arrested a man named Holland, at Southampton, on suspicion of his having been the bearer of treasonable communications between Bole and his family. It happened, that Geoffrey Bole, the younger brother of the cardinal, saw this man, as the officers were conducting him to London. Geoffrey learnt enough from Holland to become aware that other arrests would speedily take place, and, hastening back to the metropolis, he volunteered evidence against the suspected persons, even against the members of his own family, on condition that his own life should be spared. Among the persons accused by this base man, steeped himself beyond the rest in treason, were his own brother, Henry Bole, lord Montacute, Sir Edward Neville, representing the great Warwick influence, and the marquis and marchioness of Exeter, whose power through Devonshire and the west was known to be formidable. That all these parties were disaffected, and that their disaffection had led them to indulge in much treasonable talk, and in something more, espe cially as a Spanish invasion became probable, was well known to the government. But evidence of a more"], [287, "REFORMATION AND THE SIX ARTICLES. 265 BOOK VI, Chap 4. direct kind than had been obtained was desired, and such evidence Geoffrey Bole was prepared to supply. All the men named were represented as having been in communication with Beginald Bole, as approving his plans, and as contemplating nothing less than to raise another person to the throne.* Exeter himself, it seems, hoped to be the future king. The marquis had said \u2014 'I trust once to have a fair day on the ' knaves about the king : \u2014 and I trust to see a merry ' world one day.' On this evidence, all the men named, and several others, were tried, condemned, and executed. Such was the issue of Bole's third attempt, and which was to be no failure. One brother he saw delivered to the executioner, another to infamy. But some such end of all this plotting was to have been expected. The schemes of Baul III. were singularly imbecile. The dreams of the cardinal were what they had always been, the dreams of a man whose passions took the place of his judgment. And the emperor was not likely to risk much along with such co-ad jutors.f The next year Charles abandoned all thought of attempting anything against England, and Bole then began to have new impressions concerning his majesty of Spain, as well as about his majesty of England, and seemed to despair of everybody. If the heart of the cardinal was burdened with the memory of what had befallen his brothers, there was * Montacute was charged with saying, ' I like well the doing of my brother cardinal Pole, and I never liked any doing of the king.

If we may tarry for the time, we shall do well enough. It must needs come to this pass some day, and I fear me we shall lack nothing so much as honest men.

His mother, the aged countess of Salisbury, had been arrested with the marchioness of Exeter, and both had been sentenced by attainder as guilty of treason. The marchioness was pardoned, though she had been a meddler with doubtful matters from the time when the Maid of Kent began to talk her treason. Butithe countess was not pardoned. She remained a prisoner in the Tower nearly two years. Her reception of the earl of Southampton, when sent to question her after the arrest of her sons, was such as a proud, brave man, conscious of his innocence, might have been expected to give him. His lordship's first impression was, that her ladyship must really have kept aloof from the dangerous proceedings going on in her family.* But search being made, documents and letters were found of a nature to justify suspicion, and one letter, without a signature, but evidently from the countess to lord Montacute, appears to have contained the matter on which the proceedings against her were mainly based. It was generally supposed, however, that a sentence so long suspended would never be executed. What led the king and the government to take another course is to this day unknown. The presumption is, that some new cause for complaint had arisen. But, on the other hand, the presumption is no less strong, that if any such new cause had existed, it would not have been allowed to remain a secret. In that grass court of the Tower, where Anne Boleyn had met her fate, the countess ascended the scaffold. But she refused to place her neck upon the block. It was for traitors thus to confess their treason. The attendants were obliged to force her body into the re quired posture, and her last words were \u2014 ' Blessed are ' they who suffer persecution for righteousness' sake.' So died Margaret, countess of Salisbury, when more * Ellis's Letters, 2nd Series, ii. 110\u2014114."], [289, "267 REFORMATION AND THE SIX ARTICLES. than seventy years of age, a near relation to the king, bookvi, and the nearest descendant of the Blantagenet line of CHAe' 4\" princes. The defiant pride which had characterized this lady through life she evinced in death. That she approved the course of her son abroad, and had encouraged a similar policy on the part of her sons at home, can hardly be doubted.* Beliirion was at the root of all this antagonism \u2014 of Causes of o t this ex these plottings and risings against law, and of this treme'an free shedding of blood in the name of law. It is ,as\u00b0msm natural to deplore that scenes so appalling should have come up in connexion with a cause so sacred. But these scenes have a meaning of which the student of history should be observant. They nearly all belong to the first ten years after the meeting of the Beforma tion Barliament. They show the strength of the feeling opposed at that time to the reformed faith. They reveal to us, also, that only a strong hand could have been equal to the mastery of such a resistance. They suggest, moreover, that it would not be exactly reasonable to expect, that the hand capable of counter acting such subtle, unscrupulous, and insurgent forces, should be a hand to be stayed in all instances at the right point. In religious revolutions, the earnestness necessary if right is to be done, will always be an earnestness liable to excess \u2014 liable to pass into wrong. And it is scarcely needful to add, that the restrictions on personal freedom, and the severe penalties of law, which would be so much crime in a highly civilized state of society, may be so much wisdom and virtue in states of society much less advanced.

BOOK VI Chap. 4. action of the power above them is found to be sufficient. Those laws of Henry VIII., which re garded opinion as crime, and shut men up to the alternative of self-conviction or perjury, were of the essence of wickedness, and were as impolitic as they were immoral. We cannot look on the dreadful spectacles with which Henry made his subjects familiar during those ten years, without feeling their frequent cruelty. But Henry knew that the parties who were so intent on chasing him from his throne, were not them selves restrained by nice feeling of any description; and he had evidently learnt to think, that it did not become him to deal softly and delicately with enemies whose policy knew nothing of such qualities, and who would be sure to misinterpret them if allowed to have any place in his own course of proceeding. Bole and his friends accounted themselves religiously right. So did Henry and his government. It was the supposed sanctity of their cause that gave such intensity to their passions ; and the huge, complex mass of secular interests which had become blended with the religion of the time, contributed to bring the influence of both worlds into the strife. With Bomanism, more over, there could be no compromise. That system would be supreme or nothing. The point to be settled between the crown and the papacy accordingly was, who should be victor, and who should be van quished. The chiefs felt this to be the issue, and so did their followers. Beligion, when it becomes socially corrupt, presents the worst form of social cor ruption, and when it is socialhy pure, it presents the best form of social purity. Of all reforms, the reform of religion is the most momentous, and it ought not to occasion surprise if such changes are found to be especially difficult to realize, and especially costly in the process.

The aim of Nationalist and Brotestant was bookvi, towards a more rational freedom, and a more true CnAF 4' religion, and as the end was seen to be pre-eminently good, so the affection due to it was felt to be great, and the sin of resisting it was accounted great. We have seen that Henry, while introducing so Henry win many changes into the English church, was forward \u2122un*ed a to repel the charge of having ceased to be a Catholic, rrotestant. Even in his attempts to league himself with the Lutherans, he negotiated on grounds of his own. The disciples of Luther, it was presumed, should submit to him. It was not to be expected that the most learned king in Europe should submit to them. The great majority of the clergy had moved in favour of innova tion only so far as the pleasure of the king had com pelled them to move. In the spring of 1536, the two houses of convocation set forth a series of nearly sixty errors or heresies current among the people, which it became the authorities of the church to suppress. Henry, with the assistance of his divines, prepared a document, which was presented by Cromwell to the two houses of convocation, under the title of a ' Book Book of ' of Articles.' In these articles, the people were ex- Article8 l^ected to see the care that had been taken to leave the doctrine of the Catholic church undisturbed. Such, however, was not the impression produced by them. ' The very same opinions about pilgrimages, images, ' and saints departed, and about instructing the people ' in the principles of the Christian religion in the ' vulgar tougue, for which the Lollards were not long ' ago either burnt, or forced to abjure them, were now ' set up by the king's authority. From which they ' concluded, that whatever the king might say about ' his maintaining the old doctrine, he was now changing ' it.'* But every incumbent was bound to read these articles to his parishioners, and during some months to come, no clergyman was to preach without a special * Burnet, i. 409-412."], [292, "270 NATIONALISTS AND ROMANISTS. book vi. licence from a bishop. The next year the king issued Chap'4' the short treatise intitled ' The Institution of the Kestraint < Christian Man' in which he reiterated his belief in the on preach- ' - ing. leading Catholic doctrines ; declared that tbere could be no salvation where the true sacraments were not iS37. duly administered ; and placed resistance to the royal authority, in any conceivable circumstances, among the deadly sins. suppression On the suppression of the northern rebellion, Henry abbeys. resolved to put an end to the great abbeys which had been spared by the commissioners in that year. Some of the abbots surrendered their establishments into his hands, in the hope of being liberally treated; and others were displaced on the ground of disloyalt}7, immorality, or gross superstition. These proceedings, however, were not more than partially approved. Many of the ignorant were shocked, and some who were not ignorant alleged, that the many had been made to suffer for the sins of the few. To justify themselves, the government exposed the immoralities, and especially the superstition and fraud, connected with the worship of images and relics which they had detected. The revelations of the latter description which were made, show the degraded state to which the popular belief had been reduced. F.xposureof The monks of Beading were in possession of an sraudVnd angel with one wing, who had preserved the spear Pefs'iitionU with which the side of our Lord was pierced. The religious men of the abbey at Bury St. Edmunds exhibited some of the coals on which St. Lawrence was roasted ; and parings from the toes of St. Ed mund ; also the penknife and boots of St. Thomas a Becket, with many pieces of the true cross. They had also relics enshrined which could give rain, and hinder the growth of weeds. In one monastery, a vial was exhibited which was said to contain some of the blood shed by our Saviour. When the worshipper was to account his prayer as answered, the vial, otherwise opaque, became transparent, and the blood could be"], [293, "REFORMATION AND THE SIX ARTICLES. 271 BOOK VI Chap. 4. seen, and the brethren had their means of causing the opaque side to be presented until the offerings of the devotee reached the satisfactory point. At Boxley in Kent, there was a famous crucifix which was seen to move its eyes, to bend its brows, and to shake its head, to the great wonder and dismay of the people. Hilsley, bishop of Bochester, placed this image before a large congregation, preached about it, and then exposed to the people the wires aud mechanism by which these profane tricks had been performed. The land was full of such things. In Wales, this heathen ism under a Christian name, was, if possible, of a still grosser description. Many of these sacred things were now removed, and burnt or destroyed by authority. The shrine of Becket himself was thus desecrated. Becket, said Henry, was a man whose life showed no signs of sanctity. He brought his death upon himself by his insolent demeanour towards the men who slew him. He died under the guilt of treason. The votive offering's at the tomb of Becket had come to be of inestimable value. The money contributions to his shrine in one year amounted to 954/. 6s. 3d. of the money of that time, while not a penny was presented at the shrine of the Saviour, and only 4I. is. Sd. to that of the Virgin.* With the fall of the religious houses came an end to the abbots as spiritual peers. The ecclesiastical power in the upper house was thus diminished by more than one half, while the secular power was much in creased by the new disposal of the abbey lauds, which favoured the rise of new families, and of families pledged to the side of reform. f * Burnet, i. 427-445; v. 237, 238. f Sixteen mitred abbeys had revenues exceeding 1000Z. per annum.

BOOK VI, Chap. 4. English Bible to be placed in churches. Tyndale his end. In the year 1536, Cromwell, in the name of the king, required every parish priest to supply his church with a copy of the whole Bible in English for the public use. It should be mentioned, that the copies thus provided, were all largely based on Tyndale's translation, and that the year which thus saw the hope of that good and brave man's life realized, saw him perish by strangling and by fire at Antwerp.* In 1 53 1, an agent of the English government named Vaughan, was employed to decoy the exile into Eng land, where he would soon have been added to the list of destroyed heretics. Tyndale, 'with the water in ' his eyes,' said to this man, ' If it would stand with 'the king's most gracious pleasure to grant only a ' bare text of the scripture to be put forth among his 'people, be it the translation of what person soever ' shall please his majesty, I shall immediately make ' faithful promise never to write more, nor abide two ' days in these parts after the same ; but immediately 'to repair unto his realm, and there most humbly ' submit myself at the feet of his royal majesty, offering ' my body to suffer what pains or tortures, yea, what ' death his grace will, so this be obtained.'f So spoke one of the firmest, most self-reliant, and devout spirits in English history. To accomplish his object, Tyndale had given himself deliberately to homelessness, labour, poverty, and danger through life, with the full ex pectation that the end would be a martyr's death. The shadows resting for the most part over his years of solitary wandering, make the glimpses we obtain of him only the more impressive, leaving the unknown in his career to fill the imagination as with the picture of a remote ideal heroism.

But they did nothing \u2014 perhaps dared not do anything. Now, in 1538, Cromwell sends the primate a copy of a new and improved edition of the English Bible ; the primate receives the book with abundance of gratitude and joy ; and the king issues new injunctions enjoining, not only that it shall be made accessible to all people in all churches, but that all shall be encouraged to read it, ' as being the true living word of God, which ' every Christian should embrace and follow if he ' would be saved.'* Nothing could seem to be more promising for the h\u00ab\"7 \u25a0* cause of reform than such proceedings.

The king of England, said those opponents, has be come more than ever a schismatic, has separated him self more manifestly than ever from Catholic Christen dom, and has degraded his ancient crown to the level of a vulgar Lutheranism. Henry was not sufficiently enlightened to be insensible to such reflections. His pride was wounded. His feeling towards those who separated from the Church of Bome further than himself, became at times most bitter and intolerant. * Burnet, i. 452-455. Anderson's Annals of the English Bible.

Severe penalties, Among the more influential of his own subjects there were many who were ingenious in their modes of awakening and strengthening such feelings. The majority of the peers, and of the bishops, had never been in favour of anything like a separation from Borne, and the powerful duke of Norfolk was at the head of this formidable body of discontented persons. In the spring of 1539 the influence of this party with the king proved to be very great, and the effect of that influence became memorably mischievous. In the parliament of that year the lords appointed a committee to consider the diversities of opinion in the country ; and to check the licence then abroad, by determining certain great points of doctrine which no man should dare to impugn. But the prelates on this committee differed so greatly and so tenaciously from each other, that nearly a fortnight passed in warm discussion and nothing was settled. Norfolk, who acted as chief minister in the lords, urged the king to take the matter into his own hands. Henry went to the house, reasoned long in support of some of the most obnoxious tenets of the Church of Borne, and succeeded in compelling Cranmer and his friends to feign assent to opinions which in their heart they re pudiated. It was under such influence that the act known by the name of the ' Six Articles' was passed. On the eucharist, this act determined that the natural body and blood of Christ are present under the forms, but not in the substance, of bread and wine ; that com munion in both kinds is not necessary to salvation ; that married life in the clergy is contrary to the law of God ; that vows of chastity, whether taken by man or woman, should be accounted binding ; that the custom of private mass should be continued ; and that auricular confession to a priest should be used as in former times. To render these decisions effective, it was provided, that if any person should preach, dispute, or write"], [297, "275 REFORMATION AND THE SIX ARTICLES. book vi. Chap. 4. Ascend ancy of the reactionists. against the doctrine of transubstantiation, it should not avail him to abjure, he should certainly forfeit goods and lands to the king, and die as a heretic ; that any person offending in like manner against any one of the other five articles, should, for the first offence, forfeit lands and chattels for ever, and suffer imprisonment at the king's pleasure, and for the second offence should die ; that priests or nuns who had married should at once separate, or be dealt with as felons ; and that priests or nuns living carnally with the other sex should suffer imprisonment and forfeiture on the first conviction, and death on the second. Truly the people of those days did well in designating such articles, to be enforced by such pe nalties, as 'the bloody six articles.' Cranmer did what he could to make them less atrocious. But Gardiner, bishop of Winchester, succeeded in making them what they were. It is said, and with apparent truth, that Henry himself was opposed to the severity of these punishments, though holding strongly to the prescribed opinions. But he assented to the act. It was therefore in reality his own.* The passing of this act was a triumph to the duke of Norfolk, and bishop Gardiner, as representatives of the parties favourable to the old faith ; over Cromwell and Cranmer as representatives of the national party, and as known to be inclined towards Lutheranism. The party which now became ascendant were disposed to make a prompt and a full use of the terrible in strument which seemed to be placed at their disposal. But Henry, to whose proclamations parliament was pleased to give an authority proper only to statutes of the realm, placed a check upon the zealots, and made them feel that his own pleasure was to take precedence of the amiable law to which they had given so cordial a welcome. For Cranmer, Henry seems to have felt something more than esteem, and the services of * 31 Hen. VIII. 14. t2"], [298, "276 NATIONALISTS AND ROMANISTS. book vi. Cromwell had not ceased to be valuable.

The startling rumour that the great minister had been sent to the Tower, and with no prospect of restoration, was rapidly spread through the country, arresting all men's thoughts, employing all men's tongues. Grandees assembled in baronial halls, and news-hunters in city, and borough, and village, were full of it. The genius of Cromwell had been so omnipresent, so self-sustained, so potent, through so many years of change and storm, that to common minds his fall was hardly conceivable.

What these ministers did without the sanction of law, they did, for the most part, believing it to be for the good of the commonwealth, and in accordance with the wishes of the king. But such a plea, though it ought to have been of weight with the sovereign, could be of no"], [299, "REFORMATION AND THE SIX ARTICLES. 277 BOOK VI, Chap. 4. Anne of Cleves. weight in any court of judicature. Both had always hoped that they should find a friend in the king if other friends should fail, and both hoped in vain. In the view of his enemies, Cromwell was not only an upstart, but *a violator of the law, and a heretic. Nearly everything the king had done as an ecclesias tical innovator\u2014 the severance from Bome ; the abridg ment of the secular power of the clergy; the sup pression of the monasteries ; the exposure and dis couragement of popular superstition ; the detection of conspiracies ; and the sharp punishment of traitors \u2014 all were largely attributed to the influence of this man. It was well known, also, that Cromwell had often checked the persecuting tendencies of magistrates and priests ; had not unfrequently taken their victims out of their hands ; and by every such act, if he made himself friends, he had also made himself enemies. Of late, moreover, the policy of the minister had not been successful. Charles and Francis had sud denly become great friends. The emperor had paid a visit to his Most Christian brother in Baris, in the most confiding manner. Bole was doing his utmost to direct the hostility of the papacy, of Spain, of France, and of the Netherlands against England. Such a combination, it was said, would compel the king of England to retrace his steps, or to resign his crown. Meanwhile, Henry's treasury had not been so economically managed as to furnish the means that might be necessary to meet such a posture of affairs. It was this aspect of foreign politics, taken along with the papal reaction at home, which made Cromwell especially desirous that an alliance might be formed between England and the Lutheran states of Germany. Hence came the unhappy engagement of the king of England to marry Anne, sister to the duke of Cleves. What the Anne Boleyn affair had been to Wolsey, the Anne of Cleves affair became to Cromwell. Henry found his betrothed, when she came to England, to be anything but the person that had been described to"], [300, "278 NATIONALISTS AND ROMANISTS. BOOK VI Chap. 4. Charges against Cromwell him. His aversion to the unfortunate princess was such as nothing could remove. But a quarrel with Germany was not to be hazarded when hostility was bristling up almost everywhere beside. Henry sup pressed his feehng, and consented to be married. But Anne never became his wife. The man who had become enamoured of Jane Seymour before resolving to dispose of Anne Boleyn, now became the lover of Katherine Howard while standing in the relation of a husband to Anne of Cleves. Katherine was niece to the duke of Norfolk, and that nobleman, on his return from a visit to Baris, assured the king that there was no probability of any cordial action between Charles and Francis. So the motive for seeking a German alliance, a policy which had always been dis tasteful to Henry, and never thought of except to meet some difficulty, had ceased to operate. It is easy to see how all these influences would be made to bear against Cromwell. The evil of this ill fated marriage, and evil in a hundred directions beside, was laid to his charge, and the king seems to have allowed him to become a scapegoat to bear . away a multitude of sins \u2014 sins which, in many instances, were more those of the master than of the servant. All this had happened before the day on which Norfolk and his friends congratulated each other on the suc cess of the toils which they had been secretly placing about the path of their victim for a long while past. The charges preferred against Cromwell were, that he had released persons imprisoned on conviction or suspicion of treason ; that he had enriched himself with bribes, granting licences to merchants contrary to law for such considerations ; that he had sent out commissions in his own name, saying that ' he was ' sure of the king ;' that he had infringed in many ways on the rights of his majesty's subjects ; that he had threatened, should the lords take measures against him, to chastise them as men of their order had never been chastised before ; that being full of heresies, he"], [301, "REFORMATION AND THE SIX ARTICLES. 279 was always in league with heretics, discharging them book vi, from prison, rebuking their prosecutors, and encourag- nAP' 4' ing the distribution of their writings ; that he had said, after listening to the false and unlawful teaching of Dr. Barnes and others, ' that if the king should ' turn from it, he would not ; and if the king did turn, ' and all his people with him, he would fight in the ' field in his own person, with his sword in his hand ' against him, and all others ;' that, unsheathing a dagger and brandishing it aloft, he said he would so do, ' or let this dagger thrust him to the heart ;' and that if he should exist only another year or two, it should not be in the power of the king to resist the reformed doctrine if he should be so disposed.* To suppose that Cromwell really uttered such Ground of language, and made such an exhibition of himself, men\" 8 would be to suppose that England during the last ten nfmmst years had been in the hands of a maniac. Cromwell was prime minister fifteen months after he is said to have played the madman in this fashion. Could the king have been left so long in ignorance of such con duct ; and if Cromwell must have ceased to be Crom well in so committing himself, must not Henry have ceased to be Henry, in seeming for a day to have been insensible to what had happened ? We know next to nothing of the evidence on which the above series of accusations was founded. Much of it might be sound, much of it was beyond doubt worthless. It may be true that Cromwell accepted bribes, and often acted unduly on his own authority ; that he be friended reformers, and imposed restraints upon their persecutors ; that he at times spoke strongly against the enemies whom he knew to be plotting his destruc tion ; and that he had been known to declare that if the king should abandon the reformed faith, he would not himself abandon it. Supposing all this to be true, it remained to be shown that there was treason in it. * Burnet, i. 505, 506."], [302, "280 NATIONALISTS AND ROMANISTS. But whatever might have been the evidence, Henry should assuredly have ceded the chance and right of a fair trial, to the man who during so many years had rendered him service such as no living man beside could have rendered. Depositions were taken ; they were deemed sufficient by the partisan officials before whom they were made ; and parliament was summoned to pronounce judgment, without seeing a single witness, or hearing a word from the accused in his own defence. Unhappily, Cromwell had been concerned in dealing such hard measure to others. Six weeks after his commitment to the Tower, he closed his career on the scaffold, the ' ragged knave,' says Hall, who officiated as headsman, performing his office most villanously. As usual, attempts were made to extract a vindica tion of the proceedings of the government from the last words of its victim. In what purported to be a speech uttered by Cromwell on the scaffold, he was made to confess that he died according to law, that he had been seduced into error, but that he had repented, and died a Catholic. It was convenient that some thing of this nature should be credited.* But a prayer which this sagacious and bold statesman appears to have drawn up for his use in the Tower, and which he repeated on the scaffold, has been preserved by those who were concerned that justice should be done to his memory. It is the prayer of an enlightened and devout Brotestant, such as Luther himself might have offered. f Cromwell, indeed, appears to have been one of that class of men to whom it is given to see the truth of things clearly, in matters of opinion and in affairs, but whose moral susceptibilities, while cultivated and right in the main, form the weaker part of their nature.

HAF' 4' He looked on Henry as destined to free England from the usurpation and the corruption which had come from that source ; and so momentous in his estimation was this work, that the arbitrary and violent proceed ings associated with his name, were regarded as justi fied by the magnitude and sacredness of the object to be accomplished by them. With him, the safety of the reformation was always present as the supreme law. His intentions were patriotic and benevolent. He was a refuge to not a few under oppression \u2014 a strength to many in their weakness. He would have made the English church, not only all she became under Eliza beth, but an institution much more liberal. He would have subdued the Bomanist party more speedily, by leaving less room for division among Brotestants. The great puritan schism, which has issued in severing half the nation from the established church, would have proved less formidable, from being made less reasonable. The via media course chosen in those days was plausibly wise, not really so. Bomanists could no more be at one with Nationalists than with Lutherans. Cranmer, who knew Cromwell well, pleaded his Pcrsecu cause when all beside had deserted him \u2014 as he had pleaded for Anne Boleyn, in similar circumstances, four years before. He knew that he must not seem to doubt the guilt of any one whom the king regarded, or affected to regard, as guilty. But he could not forbear to assure his majesty, that his impression of Cromwell had always been, that no king could pos sess a more able, diligent, or faithful subject. Even Cranmer, however, had now ceased to be safe. He owed his life to the personal feeling of Henry towards him.* Two days after the execution of Cromwell, Dr. * Strype's Cranmer, c. 27.

The three sufferers met their trial by fire firmly and faithfully, and fill an honourable place in the band of martyrs who were to contribute so largely towards the liberation of their country.

Among the persons who fell into the hands of these people was Anne Ascue, the daughter of Sir Thomas Ascue, of Lincoln shire.

To that time the six articles re- vni.y mafned on the statute book as expressing the doctrine of the English church. The penalties connected with some of the minor points were softened, and the en forcement of the statute was impeded and moderated by the intervention of the crown, but the terror which its existence could hardly fail to inspire was always present. In the polity and ritual of the church, and in many things beside, Henry had introduced great reforms, and he adhered to those reforms to the last. But the church he left, while so sternly Brotestant in many of her aspects, continued rigidly Catholic in doctrine. Transubstantiation, the mass, the confes sional, and the sacredness of religious vows remained as they had been. But such a footing could not of course be long retained. A change for better or worse there must soon be, and the cost of going forward must be small, compared with the cost inseparable from going backward. From the fall of Cromwell, the leaders of the Bo- g^rtyln manist party in the government and in the court were the govern the duke of Norfolk, his son lord Surrey, the bishops poseduTre- Gardiner and Bonner, and Wriothesley, the lord chan- sorm cellor.

But, in their confidence of power, they attempted to number such men as Cranmer and La timer among their victims. Their conduct towards persons who were less capable of self-defence, was in * 35 Hen.

Even the members of the king's household, and the queen her self, were not, it seems, secure against their insinu ating and malignant policy.* At the time of the king's death, Wriothesley was the only man among those above-named who retained position and power. Lord Surrey hoped to become regent in the event of the king's death, and probably something more, and paid the penalty of his ill-regulated ambition on the scaffold. The duke of Norfolk could not plead igno rance of his son's rash proceedings, and was concluded to have been more or less a party to them.f The duke was under sentence of attainder when the king died. Gardiner had fallen so much under Henry's displeasure, as the consequence of his intriguing policy, that his name was erased from the list of persons appointed to act as his majesty's executors, and as guardians of the realm on a new accession. Bonner shared in the sus picion which his colleagues had brought upon them selves, and which had left them so powerless. Henry's leanings, after the first triumph of this party, were not in favour of their proceedings. Latimer and others, when assailed by these men, made the king their refuge. Henry still clung to the doctrine of transubstantiation. On other points Gardiner's inqui sitors did not find it easy to obtain convictions. And those who best knew the final sentiments of the monarch, affirmed, that had his life been spared an other twelvemonth, he would not have left a mass to be said in all England.

So many years of access to the English Bible, sent by tens of thousands through the land ; such a free use of English prayers, full of scriptural ideas, breathing so much scriptural feeling, and provided by command of the king ; and such a profuse distribution of books, licensed and unlicensed, on religious sub jects \u2014 all had tended to set the mind and utterance of the nation at liberty, so that every man had his share to bring to the wisdom or folly, the moderation or excess, of the common strife. To such a degree had this polemical spirit taken hold of the people, that the unseemly brawls said to be taking place in churches, in public places, and even in alehouses, about the meaning of scripture texts, led the king and the par liament to forbid the reading of the scriptures in English, except by persons known to be of some edu cation.* But the floodgates had been taken away. No hand could replace them. The mind of a nation never changes as the mind of the English nation was then changing without generating some such excesses.

It has been common to attribute the mass of social evil found in England under the Tudors to the bad government of those princes, and especially to the religious innovations for which they were so greatly responsible. But there is scarcely a form of that social evil which cannot be shown to have come to the Tudors as a bad heritage from more feudal times. If there was to be a regeneration of Eng land, the great processes of change which are conspi cuous in our history under the house of Tudor were indispensable. The errors in administration under those sovereigns were nearly all traditional. They were accepted from the past. And if the new policy seemed at times only to aggravate the old disorders, such effects were by no means unnatural.

It happened, not always because the things broached were so new, but often because they were not new enough ; or because the new men had not risen to the level of the new principles by which they professed to be governed. We shall have to speak of much that was then done as being neither wise nor humane, but the evils to be dealt with were for the most part old grievances, and they would have been removed sooner, if the remedies applied to them had not been so often the old remedies. To describe England under Henry VIII. and Edward VI. as a country which had de- teriorated, if compared with what had preceded, is to discourse unreasonably, ungratefully, and untruly. In this chapter an attempt will be made to show how far the state of society under Henry VIII. had its roots in the past, and the manner in which the old was affected by the new. Our history has been a growth \u2014 a growth in all things. It is possible to exhibit the feudal system as em- bracing so much compactness, completeness, and splendour as to fascinate the imagination in its favour. Such a network of relations, found everywhere, de- scending from the high to the low, based in all con- nexions on vows of mutual fidelity, and directed avowedly towards a high and common object, seems to bespeak the presence of no ordinary measure of intelligence and of social virtue. But, in fact, the system was not so much a combination between the high and the low, as a combination of the strong against the weak. Centralized as it was, it did not suffice to preclude local disorder, but tended rather to create it. It was in contentions of that nature, more than in hostilities between one nation and another, that feudalism found outlets for its martial temper. Only under such a system could the wars of the Boses have been possible. Feudalism despised commerce. It bestowed but a partial encouragement even upon agri- culture. It cannot be said to have been a friend to"], [311, "BOOK VI Chap. 5. ENGLAND UNDER THE FIRST REFORMATION. 2S9 literature. The highest style of man in its estimation was man in arms. To a large extent, it was a com bination by which men who had weapons extorted services from those who had none. It is true, in those days, nobles were often checks upon kings, and kings were often checks upon nobles, and the classes below sometimes profited by these quarrels between the men above them. But the mass of the people felt that those fighting men were their masters, and that the service to which they were doomed by those strong hands was often a hard bondage. Beneath the shadow of this system, the villain and the serf were wronged and depressed in every way possible. Such men could plead no right, could possess no property, but were in reality slaves in the hands of the owners of the soil. Among the evils of those times were the cruelties inflicted in defence of the forest laws ; the robberies perpetrated under the name of purveyance ; and the arbitrary dealing with the property of heirs and heiresses during their minority, and in respect to marriage. The chivalrous glitter seen on the distant surface of this state of society is deceptive. Beneath it was a deep and dark flood of social evils which time was to bear away. The preamble to a law in the time of Bichard II. describes a large portion of England as overrun with bands of armed men, who plundered the people, murdered without scruple, carried off women, and had become so bold as to take possession of estates by no other title than their swords.* These were the disorders which Henry VII. sought to remove by making the armed following which had been so common among the feudal nobility unlawful, f * 2 Ric.

BOOK VI, Chap. 5. Military training. In the time os his successor, the fruit of his wise and firm policy in this respect had become manifest. The influence of the commons and of the crown had come to be powerful enough to awe the temper of the nobles, and had made that vigorous action on the part of the government possible without which there could have been little progress. Until very recently, we have been so much accus tomed to think of military training as belonging only to men who are soldiers by vocation, that to realize the England of the past in this respect requires some effort of imagination. In the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, all men liable to be taxed by the state were expected to qualify themselves for appearing in arms in its defence. The soldier was combined with the yeoman, or with the citizen, in the person of the free man. The men holding so much property were to be armed after one manner, those holding less after another, but all persons above the lowest, even the servants in ordinary households, were to be enrolled and equipped in some form for military service.* The Englishmen who acquitted themselves so well at Flodden field, had been suddenly summoned to the strife from those village greens and town neighbour hoods where they had been wont to give the fragments of their time to exercises in arms. Every locality had its military organization. Every village was to pro vide ' a paire of butts,' \u2014 an archery ground for bow practice. Laws were passed to suppress ' unthrifty ' games,' and to encourage the people to seek their taking of money by juries, by great riots, and unlawful assemblies, the policy and good rule of this nation is almost subdued.' \u2014 3 Henry VII. c. 1. * ' With regard to the land forces, speaking of the infantry, or the soldiers serving on foot, these would indeed be innumerable, if we took into account all those who, in case of need, would rise for the defence of the kingdom, remote as they are.

France confided Chap 5\" most in her men-at-arms, Scotland in her pikemen, England in her men with the longbow. It was this last weapon that had given the Engbsh their victories at Cressy, Foiotiers, and Agincourt. So strong and steady was the arm of the Englishman in the use of this implement, that he could send an arrow from it with fatal effect to the distance of more than two hundred yards Men-at-arms had sometimes only to look on, while the bowmen brought the enemy down by hundreds, and ensured victory before the hand-to hand struggle became possible.* While the feudal system was in its vigour, these The king local organizations stood related for the most part to the place of the local nobility and gentry, and were commanded by \"wesTn\"' them. But the wars of the Boses prepared the wav mili,ary for their being brought into a more direct relation to the crown, by means of the authority vested for that purpose in the sheriff. From that time, the oath of the armed man was no longer the oath of the vassal to his lord, but the oath of the subject to his sovereign. This great transition could hardly have become so complete in so brief a space, had it not been hastened, and made imperative, by the civil wars. The crown, however, did not become at once so powerful in the support of these usages as the nobility had been, who had divided the work between them, and who had each his personal interests to secure by attention to it. Hence, in the time of Henry VII., men did not use the longbow as their fathers had done ; and a law * 3 Hen. VIII. c. 3 ; 6 Hen. VIII. c. 2 ; 13 & 14 Hen. VIII. c. 6 ; 2$ Hen.VIII.c.17; 32 Hen.

On the accession of Henry VIII. new enactments on this subject were published every four or five years. No pains were spared by the king to en sure that his subjects should be found brave and skilful men in the face of an enemy, whether upon the land or the deep.* Happily, an army so constituted was better adapted to defensive than to aggressive war. It could not be relied on for the prosecution of foreign service. On the continent, mercenary troops were coming rapidly into the place of forces of this order. But in England, the sword was not to pass more than very partially from the hands of Englishmen. In this reign the arquebuse \u2014 the first form of the musket \u2014 came into frequent use. We have seen at Flodden, the execution that could be done with English cannon. Subsequently, the English ordnance was often made of brass. All the headlands of the coast, and the high places in the interior, had their beacon stations, whence, in 'times of danger, the signal-mark by day, and the fire by night, could send forth a quick summons to arms. * Down to the time of Cromwell, the nobles were known to have large supplies of arms at their disposal. Cromwell, describing to Henry a visit that had been paid him by the marshal de Castillon, says, ' I took him into my armory, and showed him such store of armour and weapons as I have, which he seemed to esteem much, and I told him that there were other particular armories of lords and gentlemen in this realm, more than the number of twenty, as well or better furnished than mine ; whereat he wondered, and said, that he thought your grace the prince best fur nished thereof in Christendom.' \u2014 MS.

The national feeling in regard to piantage foreigners consisted especially in a feeling of hostility Tudors. to that country. Wolsey, as we have seen, took up this feeling, and made his use of it through the greater part of his administration. The interests of English trade were strongly on the side of an alliance with Spain and the Low Countries. The fact that Catherine, the wife of prince Arthur, and afterwards of Henry, was aunt to the emperor, was also favourable to Spanish influ ence in England. The cardinal, during the greater part of his career, conformed himself to these circum stances. He aimed to perpetuate friendship between Henry and Charles, and to secure weight to England as the natural umpire in disputes between the rival powers of the continent. With the battle of Favia came a new complexion of Effect of affairs. It was then to become manifest, that the0fraviaon tendency of the course pursued by Henry and Wolsey, J^nns of had long been, to give a dangerous ascendancy to Spain; Europe. and that the power which England had done so much to aggrandize, was utterly indifferent to Engbsh inte rests. The feeling of Henry towards Charles ceased to be what it had been ; and Wolsey had his private rea sons for encouraging the new policy dictated by this new feeling. Next came the question of the divorce, and the Effect ot startling events which followed. The pope, on whose contra-0'' friendly services Henry had so much depending, proved intractable, and intractable from being a mere puppet t'o^ in the hands of Charles. For awhile, the king of England became an ally of France, and even of the Frotestants of Germany, and little disposed to culti vate the friendship of his holiness or of the emperor. But in that interval men not favourable to Henry's reforming policy came to have their place about him, and Charles was prepared to make the change subservient to"], [316, "294 NATIONALISTS AND ROMANISTS. book vi. his policy. The asperities which the divorce controversy chapj. had ca]led forth were gra(juai]y softened. Francis was tIiveIto0newfound to be as little grateful, and as little scrupulous combina\"\u2122 as his great rival. Hence the relations of England, during Henry's later years, become, through many con- tradictory influences, perplexed, uncertain, and such as no sagacity could have foreseen. Francis, intent on making acquisitions in Italy, persuaded himself that the sultan might be a more useful ally than the king of England. The pontiff, and his more passionate adherents, were inclined to look on an alliance with Mohammedan or pagan as more tolerable than any friendly relation with the schismatic power recently set up in this country. In 1542, Spain and France were at war, and the high- handed policy of Francis, and his repudiation of his English debts, led Henry to meditate taking part with the emperor. Scotland, in the meanwhile, faithful to her traditional policy, is found ready to take side with France against the English. But the French faction in the Scottish government were to find their reward in the defeat at Solway Moss \u2014 an event the shame of which broke the heart of their king. Long negotia- tions followed that disaster. But the national party, under the able and artful guidance of Cardinal Beaton, succeeded in frustrating the plans of the English party, which was dependent at that time on the feeble, perhaps the insincere, policy -of the earl of Arran. iienryaiiies -^ was n\u00b0t before the opening of 1543 that the con himseifwuh templated treaty between Henry and Charles was progress of brought to a conclusion.

Neither was to think of any settlement with France without the concurrence of the other. Great care was taken to guard this compact against an unsatisfactory issue, by giving the greatest possible explicitness to its terms, and by a mutual renunciation of all diplomatic finesse or artifice in the interpretation of them. Should"], [317, "ENGLAND UNDER THE FIRST REFORMATION. 295 Francis reject the demands about to be made upon bookvi. him, Henry and Charles were to join in an invasion Chaf s' of France. Great was the consternation produced in Faris and in Borne by this appearance of amity in quarters where it was so little to have been expected. Francis was now called upon to desist from all hos tility against Charles, to pay his debts to England, and to cease to be a 'confederate with the Turk.' So did circumstances affect religious thought and feeling in that age. The ' Most Christian king' could dare to send his subjects to fight side by side with the disciples of Mohammed in their onslaughts upon Christians ; and the crowned head wliich was to be taken beyond all others as representing soundness in the faith, does not fear to become allied openly with the monarch who had presumed to account the bishop of Bome as bishop of Bome, and no more ; had rejected him as head of the church; and had assumed that title as his own. We wish we could speak of these proceedings as indicating the progress, not only of public opinion, but of public virtue. But we cannot so do. As the war fluctuated, Charles seized his moment for making DuP's'^h a separate treaty, contrary to his most solemn oath, ness of the leaving his good brother, the king of England, to cmper< obtain such terms as he best might single-handed.

She now has her position as part of a great European system, and her influence, in these new relations, is not only to be perpetuated, but is to be felt as a constantly increasing influence.* We have seen, that Wolsey, and Henry under his management, almost dispensed with the use of parlia ments during the first twenty years of this reign. Within that space, parliament was assembled five times. Seven years had passed since the last was dissolved, when that of 1523 was summoned. Another seven years intervened before Englishmen were to see the next meeting of their legislature. This was a widely different course of proceeding from what had obtained under Edward III.\u2014 when parliaments were convened, on the average, even more frequently than once a year. But amidst the disorders of the fifteenth century, they had been assembled, or dispensed with, * In a memorial by a Venetian ambassador, written a little before the accession of Henry VIII., and recently published by the Camden Society, we have the impression of an intelligent foreigner concerning England and the English people at that time. Our ancestors in those days, it seems, possessed a strong feeling of nationality \u2014 a feeling which our neighbours sometimes intimate is still in excess among us. ' The English are great lovers of themselves, and of everything belonging to them ; they think that there are no other men than themselves, and no other world but England ; and whenever they see a handsome foreigner, they say, ' He looks like an Englishman,' and that 'it is a great pity he should not be an Englishman;' and when they partake of any delicacy with a foreigner, they ask him whether such a thing is made in their country.' Speaking of culprits who, on leaving sanctuary, are obliged to leave the kingdom, the writer remarks \u2014 ' It is not unamusing to hear how the women and children lament over the misfortune of these exiles, asking how they can live so destitute out of England, adding that ' they had better have died than go out of the world,' as if England were the whole world.' \u2014 A Re lation of the Island of England, 20, 21, 35."], [319, "297 ENGLAND UNDER THE FIRST REFORMATION. according to the exigencies of faction ; so much so, book vi. that the churchmen who came into power on the HAF\" 5' accession of Henry VII., seemed to have had scarcely any idea of the real nature of the English monarchy, and would have sustained almost any stretch of authority in the king. The expenditure of Henry VIII. was large. But Illesal at the fixed revenue from the customs, and from many raise other sources, was also large. We have seen, also, the money attempts made by Wolsey to raise money illegally, in the form of benevolence and loan. The popular protest, in city and country, against such exactions, did more to save the right of parliament in matters of taxation, than anything done by the parliament itself.* When the Beformation Barliament was convened, Henr5' ia , cm do we red Henry was greatly in debt. One of the services to defraud rendered to him by that house of commons, as a part of the understood price of his compliance with their reform policy, was to relieve him from difficulty in that form, by empowering him to repudiate the claims of all persons from whom he had obtained loans of money. The plea set forth in the preamble to this memorable enactment is, that the sums so obtained had been honestly expended in the cause of his holi ness, ' The Head and Brince of the World ;' in repress ing ' a damnable schism ;' in imposing a check on the ' inordinate ambition of those who aspired to the ' monarchy of Christendom ;' and in assuring safety, rest, and property to his majesty's own subjects. But, plausible as this language might sound, its fraudulence becomes palpable when compared with the words of the king to the money-lenders. 'We, Henry VIII., ' by the Grace of God King of England and of France, ' Defender of the Faith, and Lord of Ireland, promise ' by these presents, truly to content and repay unto our ' trusty and well-beloved subject, A. B., the sum of ' , which he hath lovingly advanced unto us by * See pp. 48-58."], [320, "298 NATIONALISTS AND ROMANISTS. BOOK VI. Chap. 5. The bene volence ex acted in 1545 ' way of loan, for defence of our realm, and maintenance ' of our wars against France and Scotland. In witness ' whereof we have caused our Frivy Seal to be set ' and annexed day of , fourteenth year 'of our reign.'* That the money so lent would be honestly applied was of course supposed, and could be no reason for evading the repayment which had been thus solemnly pledged. It was competent to the house of commons to levy a tax that would enable the king to pay these debts ; or, seeing that all such modes of raising money for government purposes were mani festly illegal and dangerous, they might have left the borrower and the lenders to adjust their affairs between themselves ; but to pass such an act, was to use their supreme power to perpetrate a public fraud. That what was done would be thus regarded must have been foreseen. ' When this release of the loan,' saj^s a contemporary, ' was known to the commons of the ' realm, Lord ! how they grudged and spoke ill of ' the whole parliament ! For almost every man ' counted it his debt, and reckoned surely on the pay ' ment of the same, and, therefore, some made their ' wills of the same, and some other did set it over to ' other for debt ; and so many had loss by it, which ' caused them sore to murmur. But there was no ' remedy. 'f In one view, the effect of this proceeding would be wholesome. It was well for the liberties of the country that the credit of our kings as borrowers should not stand very high, and after this event it could hardly stand lower. We should be glad to think that a motive of this description had something to do with the conduct of these thrifty commoners, but we have no evidence to that effect. In 1544, indeed, there was a recurrence to a measure of this description ; and in 1545, a large benevolence was solicited, which was in effect as compulsory as a regular tax. It is true the * Hallam, Constitutional Hist. i. 26. t Hall."], [321, "ENGLAND UNDER THE FIRST REFORMATION. 299 country was then in great danger. Charles had bookvt. treacherously deserted Henry, and had left England Chaf' 5' exposed to formidable hostilities from France and Scotland. But these circumstances were hardly an excuse. Any reasonable supply might have been ob tained through a parliament ; and if an immediate loan was necessary, it was not necessary that it should have been in the form of personal assessments, or of what were virtually such. But such modes of raising money had strong recommendations to a king of Henry's temper. It made resistance the act of private persons, and every such person found himself exposed single-handed to the whole strength of the government. Beed, an alderman of London, refused, on constitutional grounds, to contribute to the loan of J545- With an arbitrariness worthy of the Grand Turk, Henry sent him to serve against the Scotch on the border, with instructions that he should be ex posed to the severest hardships and dangers of camp life. Nevertheless, the money so extorted was described as a ' benevolence' \u2014 as money given from a good will. Bersons whose will did not happen to be good, were expected to remember the city alderman, and to be wise. The revenue of the crown under Henry VIII. came crown re from the port dues called tonnage and poundage ; Henry from fines imposed on merchants, traders, and persons vm. in various occupations, for permission to follow their respective callings ; from imposts levied upon amuse ments and dress ; from the appropriation, after the separation from Bome, of the first-fruits and tenths from all livings ; from the spoils of monasteries ; from the forfeited estates of persons convicted of treason ; from the Statute of Uses, which gave a tribute on lands, in place of the feudal profits on wards and marriages ; from the old feudal domains of the crown ; and from exchanges, and new appropriations of lands, under various pretexts.

The position of our ancestors as islanders saved them from much of the danger of invasion, and from much of the expenditure that would otherwise have fallen upon them. Subsidies, when they were said to amount to a fifteenth or a tenth upon a man's substance, seem to be a heavy burden ; but it must be remem bered that these were generally paid in instalments, extending over years, and it is certain that the property returns made to the commissioners were generally at a rate much below reality.

Jerome Cardan, writing in the time of Edward VI., states that during the reign of Henry VIII. , not less than 72,000 persons were executed, prin cipally, it would seem, for theft. The authority given by Cardan for this statement is the bishop of Lisieux, in Normandy, who was then in this country. From Cardan the statement was taken by Harrison, the author of the account of the state of England introductory to Holinshed's Chro nicle, and from Harrison it has passed into the pages of our historians. Mr. Froude (vol. iii. 408) does not at all credit the statement. But it does not seem to me to be incredible. England and Wales include fifty two counties, and an average of a little more than forty executions for each county in a year would give the specified number for the whole reign. From what we know of the number of executions in later and less severe times, we can suppose the work of the hangman under Henry to have made a much nearer approach to what the bishop has stated fhan Mr. Froude is inclined to admit.

The lower classes, with rare free labour. excep+ji0ns, were thus placed in a comparative indepen- dence which did not tend at once, and in all instances, to their advantage. When landlords became unfeeling, or when inclination prompted, labourers often became wanderers. It was observed of this class, that such as had once seen war scarcely ever went back to steady occupation. In those days, it was a comparatively new thing for a labourer to be at liberty to take his labour to any market, according to his humour, and many abused their liberty in roaming from place to place. Becoming homeless, they often became penni- less, and in the end criminal ; and the man who had once entered on such a course of life was rarely re- claimed from it.

It must be book vi. confessed, we think, that the idea of society suggested CHAP' s' by these facts is not of a very romantic or agreeable description. If we are not to account'these measures as greatly wanting in wisdom and humanity, we must regard the habits of the lower classes of the people as deeply disordered. One of Henry's later thoughts was, to institute a The poor poor-box in every parish, that the beggar might be box' relieved to a certain extent, and placed in the way of finding employment. But the supply in the box was left to voluntary contribution, and afforded but small assistance. The fines imposed on those who failed to cut the gristle of the ear close, or to flog women until the blood came, attest very plainly that the cruelty of the king was often rebuked by the humanity of his subjects. It does not seem to have been suspected, that to fix the mark of a vagabond upon a man for life, was to make him a vagabond for life. This prin ciple holds in all such punishments \u2014 they wed the degraded to his degradation. And what are we to say of the government which hands over young children to servitude \u2014 to a virtual bondage, after the above fashion ? In all departments, the administration of criminal \u00a3\u00a3\u2122j\u00a3'*\"f law under Henry VIII. was loose, arbitrary, and more criminal or less oppressive. The custom of proceeding against rany^oV. state criminals by attainder,, suspended some of the first principles of justice in favour of the crown, and to the injury of the subject. For the parliament, as we have seen, in pronouncing its judgment upon offen ders after that form, did so on the report of depositions by witnesses whom they had never seen, and in the absence of the accused persons whose lives were in their hands. ' Nor was there a single apparent secu rity to which persons charged with treason could look with confidence, inasmuch as the terrorism exercised by the government sufficed to ensure the most ser vile submission, both from judges and juries. It was II x"], [328, "306 NATIONALISTS AND ROMANISTS. BOOK VI Chap. s. Court of the Star Chamber. left to a statute under Edward VI. to enact explicitly, that in cases of treason there should be two witnesses placed face to face with the person accused.* An instrument which contributed not a little to make the power of the crown thus formidable was the court of the Star Chamber. This court came into the place of the old council of ministers and nobles, which from the conquest downwards had been supposed to be always at the call of the king. An act in the third year of Henry VII. gave a legal and settled basis to this authority in regard to the sort of offences which fell within its province.! ' It is the ' effect of this court,' says a contemporary, ' to bridle ' such stout noblemen or gentlemen as would offer ' wrong by force to any manner of men, and cannot ' be content to demand or defend the right by order ' of law. It began long before, but took augmenta ' tion and authority from that time that Cardinal ' Wolsey, archbishop of York, was chancellor of ' England, who of some was thought to have first ' devised that court, because that he, after some inter ' mission, by negligence of time, augmented the autho ' rity of it, which was at that time marvellous ne ' cessary to do, to repress the insolency of the noble ' men and gentlemen in the north parts of England, ' who being far from the king, and the seat of justice, ' made almost as it were an ordinary war among them ' selves, and made their force their law, binding them ' selves, with their tenants and servants, to do or ' avenge an injury one against another as they listed.'

But it is no less clear, that it was in the nature of such an institution that it should encroach on the province of the laws which it was originated ostensibly to sustain. This court, as now constituted, took under its cognizance, not only ques tions concerning the retainers and the conduct of the nobles \u2014 sheriff's empanelling juries, and juries in giving their verdict, were held responsible to it. But Sir Thomas Smith, on mentioning the conduct of the Star Chamber in punishing jurors for their verdicts, states, that such proceedings, even at that time, were ac counted ' violent, tyrannical, and contrary to the liberty ' and realm of England.' That there were instances in those days in which juries were bribed, or per jured through self-interest or party feeling, is not to be doubted. Indeed, the complaints generally made are complaints against the corruption of jurors, more than against the dishonesty of witnesses. But it was not probable that the oversight of the Star Chamber would be restricted to the conduct of jurors in cases of treason. John Tyndale, brother- to the martyr, and Thomas Batmore, merchants, were sentenced by Sir Thomas Ware, in this court, to ride round the city with their heads to their horses' tails, with papers round their heads, and to be fined at the king's plea- sure. The crime of these merchants consisted in their receiving and distributing Tyndale's Testaments. Bart of their punishment consisted in their being made to commit the books in their possession to the flames in Cheapside ; and in the matter of the fine, it was the king's pleasure, it seems, to take from the merchants some two thousand pounds in mone}'. One man is sent to the pillory for uttering ' slanderous words' about the council, and another is sentenced to have his ears nailed to that instrument. These instances are enough to indicate the range of offences which x2"], [330, "308 NATIONALISTS AND ROMANISTS. BOOK VI. Chap S. Benefit of clergy, and rights of sanctuary, came within the cognizance of this Erastian Inqui sition.* Among the great impediments to the administration of justice in the Middle Age, were the benefit of clergy, and the rights of sanctuary. Clergymen, and even laymen who could read, might claim, when charged with offence, to be exempt from the authority of the magistrate until tried by an ecclesiastical judge. The reader has seen that the Beformation Barliament did much towards putting an end to such distinctions, and towards placing all persons on the same level in the sight of the law. But the rights of sanctuary survived the other privileges of this description, and passed in a diminished form from the time of the Tudors to that of the Stuarts. Anciently, every church was a sanc tuary. But certain places were especially privileged as such. The Hebrew cities of refuge, which were the precedent adduced by the clergy in support of these institutions, were available only to the manslayer. The Christian sanctuaries were thrown open to of fenders of all grades \u2014 even to debtors. In course of time, much was done to abridge these rights, as they were called. In the reign of Henry VII. statutes were passed which denied this privilege to traitors, pirates, or servants. Sanctuary in a parish church was limited to forty days, after which time the fugitive must surrender himself for trial, or abjure the realm. The privilege offered by some of the greater sanctuaries might be enjoyed for life, and the men in such places were often the perpetrators of much crime in the neighbourhood of their respective homes. f By a law of this reign, sanctuary men, if chargeable with * In 1 5 29 we find the Star Chamber enacting very stringent regulations for the conduct of foreign artisans. \u2014 21 Hen.

But an inconvenience Chaf' 5 followed from the action of this law. These exiled offenders, it was said, were often ' expert mariners, and ' apt for the wars, so that the strength and power of ' the realm was greatly diminished ; that others of the ' abjured had instructed foreigners in archery, to the ' great increase and fortification of outward realms, ' and had disclosed their knowledge of the commodities ' and secrets of this realm.' It was enacted, ac cordingly, that in future, such persons should not be exiled, but be restricted, on pain of death, to their particular sanctuaries.* But what must the state of society have been, when its exiled murderers and felons were so numerous, as to make their influence to be thus felt among the seamen and soldiers of other states? Shut off thus from the general community, these masses of moral putridity became of course more putrid every hour. The fall of the great abbeys di minished the number of these plague districts. But even the Beformation Barliament allowed two large settlements of this description to flourish close by their own place of meeting in Westminster. In rude times such places of security had often shielded the weak against the strong. But, as commonly happens in such cases, the institution survived when its evil had come to be greater than its good. Our lawyers assure us, that the use of torture to The u^e oi extort evidence from a prisoner is unknown to our torture law. But in this respect prerogative has been above law.

' And because I lay still, and did not cry, the lord ' chancellor, and Master Bich, took pains to rack me, ' with their own hands, till I was nigh dead.'* This is the employment to which a solicitor-general, and a lord chancellor of England, could give themselves in the reign of Henry VIII. It is proper to add, that this lord chancellor was the lord Wriothesley, and that this ' Master Bich' was the one witness produced against Fisher and More. The instrument of torture known in after time by the dreaded name of the Scavenger's Daughter was an invention of this reign, and so called from Sir William Skevington, who was lieutenant of the Tower when it came into use.

The truth is, however, these changes were rife, and these murmurings were loud, very long before an acre of church land had passed into the hands of the laity. Henry VII. had looked on these evils in his time with considerable apprehension. He saw the yeomanry, the strong middle class in the rural districts, becoming, from * Anne's narrative in Foxe\u2014 a document which has every mark of authenticity."], [333, "ENGLAND UNDER THE FIRST REFORMATION. 311 BOOK VI. Chap. 5. these causes, fewer than formerly. His fear was that the nation, apart from the towns, might soon come to consist of two classes only, the wealthy, and an abject class far below them. Such, observes lord Bacon, was the state of society in France and Italy, to the great detriment of both countries ; and such, if not checked by wise laws, it bid fair to become in Eng land. Hence, so far back as 1489, it had been enacted, that every farmhouse, having not less than twenty acres of land attached to it, should be kept up as such, that so the small farmers \u2014 the stout yeomen of the land \u2014 the class that should have place between the rich and poor, might not die out, but be perpetuated as a great element in the nation's strength.* Men did not see it, but, in fact, it was the commercial pro sperity of the country which had brought up this diffi culty. Land had become too valuable to be left unen closed. The clothing trade, moreover, had become so productive, as to call for a large space of sheep-walk, that there might be an adequate supply of wool. Wool was then to the commerce of England what cotton is now. Commercial men became purchasers of land. ' The merchants,' says Edward VI., ' become landed ' men.' They take their place among the gentry, and expect, says the king, to be made magistrates. Not only abbey lands, but land generally, passed consider ably into new hands. These changes no doubt dimi nished the value of labour in some forms, but they would ensure a greater value to it in others ; and we are tempted to think that the unemplo}red must have consisted, for the most part, of the more helpless of their class, or of idlers who were such from choice. It was not in the power of the legislature to impose anything more than a partial check upon a social tendency of this nature. But with the ideas then prevalent, it was natural that something of this kind should be attempted. * Bacon's Henry VII. 59^."], [334, "312 NATIONALISTS AND ROMANISTS. BOOK VI. Chap. s. Condition of the labour ing classes. The nation, in the judgment of Henry VIII. and his senators, was by no means competent to walk alone. The landlord was not to do as he pleased in letting his land. The farmer was not to be left to his discretion in the cultivation of his farm. Em ployers and employed were not to be accounted the best judges in regard to their mutual interests. And to have left the prices of commodities to regulate themselves, would have been, it was thought, to neg lect one of the most humane and patriotic duties of a government. The statute book of this reign, accord ingly, is crowded with enactments relating to these subjects. Tillage land, it was reiterated, was favour able to population. Small farms, it was maintained, were necessary to multiply the number of substantial yeomen. By fixing the price of labour, the labouring classes were to be fairly remunerated, but in fact were placed in the hands of the classes above them.* In settling the price of commodities, if there was some care for the poor, there was care also for the heads of large feudal establishments, who hoped by such means to obtain convenient supplies on convenient terms. What the state of the labouring and artisan classes really was, as the effect of this intrusive policy on the part of the government, is a question of some interest. It is, we think, quite clear, that it has been a great mistake to assume that the conduct of the legislature in meddling with the labour market proceeded from a generous wish to protect and befriend the labourer. The language of all our statutes on this subject, from the time of Edward III. downwards, is against such a * Sir John Mason, writing concerning this way of attempting to make food cheap, says \u2014 ' I have seen so many experiences of such ordinances ; and ever the end is dearth, and lack of the thing we seek to make good cheap.

BOOK VI Chap. 5. supposition. It was not enough to tell the labourer that he must be content with a certain rate of payment, it was provided that he might be coerced into working on the prescribed terms.* It must be remembered, that the rate of wages can never be justly determined apart from the current price of commodities. Hence, to make wages per manent, and to leave the price of provisions to fluc tuate, must often have entailed a cruel injustice. It is true, attempts were made to settle the price of food. But such efforts were necessarily vain. The scale of value in the market rose and fell continually, some times above or below the ordinary level far beyond anything known in recent times. But if we take the fixed rate of wages in those times, along with the average rate of prices in the market, it will be found, we think, that the wages of the common male labourer were about eight shillings a week of our present money, and not, as recently stated, double that sum. In the statute of labourers two scales of payment are given, a scale of payment by the day, and a scale of payment by the year. Taking the former scale as our guide, the wages paid rise so high as to become on many grounds incredible. Following the latter, which would certainly seem to be the safest course, the rate of payment is reduced one half, which comports far better with what we know in relation to this subject from other sources. f The fair conclusion seems to be, that * In one of Henry's laws on this subject it was considerately provided, that if there were shires in which a lower rate of wages had obtained than was now fixed by statute, such shires should be empowered to exact labour at that lower rate, t Froude, i. 23-6. The Statute on Wages in 1514 provides that ' a chief hind, carter, or chief shepherd' shall receive it. for his yearly wages, and 5s. for his clothing, in addition to his diet. For a common servant, the payment was 16s. 8d. for the year, and 4*. for clothing. Ac cording to the scale of those times, the proportion of charge for ' meat and drink' was as one-third to the wages ; so that the entire wages of the above persons, if not boarded, would be, for the first class il. 15s., and for the second, 1 1, gs.

Diet of rich and poor. the higher wages were in harvest time, almost the only time when engagements were made by the day. And some distinction of this kind may be supposed to have obtained among the craftsmen, whose daily wages are rated, in some instances, considerably above what would seem to have been the ordinary standard. An authority of the time gives the following account of the diet of rich and poor in the time of Elizabeth, when the country will hardly be supposed to have deteriorated. ' The bread throughout the land is ' made of such grain as the soil yieldeth, nevertheless ' the gentility commonly provide themselves sufficiently ' of wheat for their own tables, while their households ' and poor neighbours in some shires are forced to ' content themselves with rye and barley bread, and ' in time of dearth, many with bread made of beans, ' peas, or oats, or of all together, and some acorns, ' of which scourge the poorest do often taste.'* In scale, as equal to a shilling now, the first of the above classes would receive in all 1 8/. a year, or at the rate of 6s. lid. a. week, according to the present value of money; and the second, j <^l., and at the rate of 5s. cjd. a week. \u2014 Brit.

Concerning the state in which the lower class of the people were left by the policy of Henry VIII. some judgment may be formed from the fact that a law was passed in the first year of his successor which required that any runaway servant, or any person living idly for the space of three days, should ' be marked with an hot iron on the breast, and be the slave of him who should bring him, for the next two years, who should cause him to work by beating, chaining, or otherwise ;' and should he desert his employer, he was to be branded on the forehead with the letter ' S,' and to be the slave of his master for ever ! In this merciless act the word ' slave' is repeatedly used, and the victim might be ironed about the neck, arms, or legs. * Harrison's Bescription of England, 31J . Latimer, in one of his sermons, speaks of bacon as a portion of food which the labourer ' may not lack.' On which a good authority upon such matters has remarked \u2014 ' I have no doubt, however, but that it formed a very inconsiderable portion of the labourer's fare ; and that even at the latter end of the fifteenth century, he lived, as the peasants of the north do now, on oat and rye-bread, milk and pottage.

What the artisans and trading classes were in the towns, the yeomen, or small landholders, were in the country. Both were comparatively well-conditioned, and together formed the strength of the nation. But the agriculture of those times was something state os very different from our own. During the Middle Age, industry in this department struggled on with little sign of improvement. To make land somewhat more than usually productive, was only to subject it to special burdens from the short-sighted cupidity of some feudal neighbour. The civil wars during the latter half of the fifteenth century were especially unfavourable to the labours of the husbandman. When the country became more settled, recovery from the depression of the last fifty years was slow and unequal. In the time of Henry VIII. the yeoman found a portion of his winter employment in making his own implements. There was little skill in manuring. Marl was the substance chiefly used for that purpose, and in disposing of it care was to be taken that the wind should be ' westerly,' and the moon in the ' wayne.' Great virtues were attributed to salt, but there was great difference of judgment about the kind of salt that had virtue. The advantage of diversifying crops on the same soil does not appear to have been much observed before the close of the sixteenth century. ask who is our captain, forsooth, his name is Poverty, for he and his cousin Necessity hath brought us to this doing j for all these persons, and many more which I would were here, live not of ourselves, but of the sub stantial occupiers of this country, and they give us so little wages for our work that scarcely we be able to live, and thus in penury we pass our time, we, our wives and children.

Crows were supposed to be greatly injurious to corn, and parliament called on the people to destroy them utterly, not knowing that by removing that evil they would be making way for a greater. The legislature further required that a certain proportion of land should be sown with hemp, that there might be a supply of that article for the fireside spinning-wheel. We have seen, also, that great effort was made to en courage tillage. The intention of these laws was good, but the fair price of corn in the market did more than the prescribed penalties to secure a measure of obedi ence to them. A work entitled A Boke of Husbandry, published by Sir A. Fitzherbert, in 1534, may be said to be the oldest work belonging to the literature of agriculture in our language.* In that day, every substantial farm' or country house was a little settle ment in itself. The linen of the house, and much that was worn as clothing, was homespun. So with articles of consumption.

' All the lands of the nobility are not in cultivation ; great portion lies barren and waste.' The writer had received an exaggerated account of the number of parks in England at that time.

We have said that attempts were made to fix the Lawstoset price of commodities as well as the rate of wages. ep\"c The doctrine of the English parliament during the reign of Henry VIII. appears to have been, that there could never be any want of commodities in the mar ket, at a reasonable price, and of good quality, if men disposed to forestall could be brought to punishment for such wickedness, and if deceitful dealers could only be made honest. Great effort accordingly was made, to reach these two classes of offenders, who were re garded as the root of so much social evil. An act of 1534 provided that persons rearing cattle and refusing to sell them to butchers at prices to be assessed by a justice of the peace, should be bound to appear in the Star Chamber, and to suffer such punish ment as should ' be thought convenient.' In like manner, merchants were made to sell their wines, or to incur heavy penalties. Butcher's meat, poultry, cheese, butter, all had a government price fixed on them. But these legislators often found that there were circumstances to which these laws could oppose no effectual resistance. In 1534, an act recites, that meat was sold at a price so ' excessive,' that his majesty's needy subjects could not gain by their labour ' salary ' sufficient to pay for their convenient sustenance.' The butchers, accordingly, were put under new and more stringent regulations. But the butchers rebelled. During three years the conflict went on between the butchers and the parliament. In the end the but chers prevailed, a law being passed which said that his highness, ' considering the dearth of all means of ' victual by reason of floods and unseasonable wea ' thers, and that if former statutes were put into ' execution, the butchers would not be able to live, nor ' his commons be well served, by his accustomed good ' ness is contented, that, during four years, all but \u25a0 chers, and others selling flesh by retail, may lawfully"], [340, "318 NATIONALISTS AND ROMANISTS. BOOK VI, Chap 5. Office of ' searchers. ' sell beef, pork, mutton, and veal, at their pleasures and ' liberties.'* It was not in the way of these legisla tors to see that the causes which had made it impossi ble to settle the price of meat, were allied with causes making it impossible to settle the price of anything. But though the parliament was slow to confess its folly in this respect, we should err greatly in our estimate of the condition of the people in this reign, if we accepted the prices of provisions settled by statute, as having been uniformly the real prices. Other causes besides ' floods and unseasonable weather,' were in constant operation to baffle such a policy. The precious metals are said to have increased fourfold within a century after the discovery of America ; and in the face of this disturbing power prices were to be stereotyped ! To ensure that goods brought to the fair or market might be what they should be, 'searchers' were ap pointed, with an authority resembling that of the modern exciseman. Too often, however, the men de puted to mount guard upon the supposed culprits be came culprits themselves. So even that expedient was to a large extent a failure. The presumption of the government seemed to be, that the nation was made up of two classes \u2014 the sellers, who were all rogues, and the buyers, who were all fools. On this ground, it came in with its own good offices, to curb the wickedness of the one class, and to protect the simplicity of the other, f * 24 Hen. VIII. c. 3 ; 33 Hen.

The corporation of London in the time of Henry VII. would have obliged their citizens to sell only in the London marts. Against this restriction the citizens rebelled, petitioned parliament, and alleged that the effect of such a regulation would be to destroy the fairs in the provinces, to the great inconvenience of his majesty's subjects. In setting forth their case, the petitioners mention some of the articles sold in those fairs.

Henry VIII. had respect mainly to the supposed de- Chaf\" s' sirableness of converting nearly all trades into mono- Jealousy os polies, and to the duty of precluding foreign from coming into competition with native industry, by sub jecting the former to every sort of disadvantage, or by shutting it out altogether. It will not be denied that there might have been good reasons for a policy some what of this nature in that age. But the extent to which it was carried was so rebuked by experience as to render it inexcusable even in those days. In the preambles to many laws concerning trade in this reign, it is alleged that multitudes of people in this country lacked employment, and in consequence became vagrants and rogues ; and that the cause of this evil was to be found in 'the great number of ' wares and merchandize made and brought out of all ' parts beyond sea into this realm, ready wrought by ' manual occupation.' In this manner, it was said, foreign countries are enriched and England is impo verished. In other words, Henry VIII., who regarded Englishmen as capable of competing with any nation under heaven in arms, despaired utterly of their power to compete with the foreign trader in their own markets \u2014 more strange still, this abject ground was taken by the popular feeling. It could not rely on its own skill and manhood, it could hope to be pro sperous only as heavy taxes should be imposed on foreign produce.

So have these aliens multiplied in this city and in its neighbourhood, that they have large settle ments to themselves in Holborn, in Southwark, in Westminster, in St. Martin's, in St. John-street, in Aldgate, in St. Catherine's, at Temple Bar, and on Tower-hill. The men whom we thus harbour among us forestall every market, and ' Englishmen want and ' starve, while foreigners live in abundance and ' pleasure.' One of the men who spoke thus, named John Lin coln, prevailed on a Dr. Bell to indulge in invective of this nature in a sermon preached before the citizens in the Spital church. The text of the preacher was, 'The heavens are the Lord's, but the earth hath he ' given to the children of men ;' and the drift of the discourse was to show ' how this land was given to ' Englishmen ; and as birds defend their nests, so ' ought Englishmen to cherish and maintain themselves, ' and to hurt and grieve aliens, for respect of their com ' monwealth.' This was on the Tuesday in Easter week. It now began to be whispered, that on the approach- May-day, an onslaught would be made upon the foreigners. Wolsey sent a caution to the city cor poration. On the evening preceding May-day, the aldermen met, and a little before nine o'clock each alderman was sent to his ward to enjoin that no person should be absent from his home after that hour. It happened, that as Sir John Mundy was returning from his ward through Cheapside, two young men were fencing with their weapons, and others were looking on. The alderman called upon them to desist and disperse. The young men wished to know why? Whereupon, the magistrate would have them sent to the Compter. But the apprentices on the spot inter-"], [343, "ENGLAND UNDER THE FIRST REFORMATION, 321 BOOK VI. Chap. 5. posed, and shouted ' 'prentices, 'prentices, clubs, clubs.' In answer to this call, multitudes, not only of 'pren tices, but of servants, watermen, and others of better condition, rushed forth from every lane, court, and doorway, and the city passed suddenly into the hands of a riotous mob. The first object of this multitude, was to release some persons from prison, who had been committed a few days before for maltreating foreigners. Next they directed their steps to the houses of the obnoxious strangers, where they committed much havoc. Fortunately, the owners had been made aware of their danger, and had fled. Towards three or four o'clock in the morning the rioters began to disperse, and many were then seized and imprisoned. So for midable was the disorder, that the lieutenant of the Tower had discharged several pieces of ordnance against the city in the course of the night. Some days later, a number of the rioters were brought to be tried. Several were sentenced to be hanged, drawn, and quartered. A moveable gallows was pro vided, that the executions might take place in the different localities which had been the chief scenes of the outrage. But after diffusing no little terror by this means, Wolsey used his influence in favour of the culprits, and they were all pardoned, with the exception of Lincoln, who was hanged.* It should be added, that this jealousy of foreigners had come down with the history of English industry from the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. It was not surpris ing that the feeling should still exist. But it was little creditable to the age that time should seem to have done nothing to abate it.f * Hall. f 21 Hen. VIII. c. 16.

The mono poly policy, It was quite natural that the policy designed to guard Englishmen so rigorously against the incon- venience of competition with the foreigner, should be extended to protect them against competition among themselves. Monopolies in the home trade, were only a natural corollary to such a system of restriction in regard to foreign trade. In the time of Henry VII. the company of Merchant Adventurers presumed to take the whole foreign commerce of the country into their hands. Heavy complaints were made by enterprising men. Barliament was induced to look at the grie- vance.* But the utmost that could be done was to make the licences issued by the company to private traders less costly, and less difficult to obtain. The great Stillyard company, consisting of foreigners who represented the Hanseatic League, still existed, and re tained its privileges. The jealousy between this com pany and the company of Merchant Adventurers, as may be supposed, was great. The discovery of the way to the East by the Cape had affected the power of the league, and confederacies disposed to act inde pendently of it had made their appearance on the continent.! In 1520, the English company prevailed on Henry to appoint a commission to inquire concern- * From the petition of these non-content merchants it appears that they had been accustomed to vend their commodities in France, Normandy, Brittany, Spain, Portugal, Venice ; also in Brabant, Zealand, Holland, Flanders, Dantzic, and many other places. \u2014 Statutes, 12 Hen.

In all these in stances, the chief men in the several manufactures petitioned the parliament against these irregular pro ceedings, alleging that the articles so produced were of an inferior description, and that the effect must be, that the reputation of the staple would be lost, that the poor people would soon be without employment, that the towns would fall into decay, and that the credit and wealth of the kingdom would be diminished. The parliament credited these representations, and the great manufacturers, who had driven their fellow-wor kers into the country by their restrictions, had now the pleasure of seeing them driven back again by act of parliament. Much to this effect was the condition of nearly every branch of trade in the kingdom.* In some instances, the intention of this policy was good. In others, it owed its origin to private cupidity \u2014 cupidity on the part of the trader, who wished to be a monopolist ; and cupidity on the part of the govern ment, which was concerned to enrich itself by grant ing licences for such purposes.

One showing being accepted, the con trary rarely comes to the surface. Until the accession of Henry VIII. the navy of England consisted of merchant vessels, hired and armed according to occasion by the government. Henry, two years after he came to the throne, built the Great Harry, which was the property of the crown, and ex clusively a ship of war. The history of the British navy, in the sense we now attach to that expression, dates from the launch of that vessel. Two years later, the Begent, a ship of a thousand tons, and capable of carrying seven hundred men, including the crew, was sent to sea. The Grace de Dieu, subsequently built, was still larger, and more powerful. Much was done, in many ways, by Henry, to ensure efficiency to every thing connected with the maritime power of the coun try. The corporation of the Trinity House was in stituted by him.* But to the decease of Elizabeth, the English navy consisted largely of hired vessels. Henry's ministers, however, in their correspondence with James V. of Scotland, declared to that monarch, that in the event of a war he would find that England was mistress of the seas, and the assertion passed unchal lenged. It was in this reign that guns were first dis charged from the port-holes of armed vessels. Hitherto they had always been placed on the deck or the poop.f It is certain that the industry and wealth of the country increased considerably during this reign.

Laws were passed to remedy this evil, some threatening to transfer the land thus neglected to the lord of the manor if not rebuilt upon by its owners. To account for these facts without supposing a decay of industry, it must be remembered that there are always causes in action to ensure that trade will pass, after awhile, from place to place ; that until re cently, the unsettled state of the country had com pelled merchants and artificers to seek safety for their persons and property within walled towns ; that with the decline of feudalism, and the more settled power of the crown, the open country had become more secure as a place of residence than it had been at any time in our history; and that the monopolist policy of the more wealthy classes in the great centres of trade, naturally tended, as we have seen, to scatter a large portion of the population into villages and other towns. Eminent merchants, who had often joined in the lament over the ruin of towns, when they became sufficiently wealthy, began to rear their stately halls in the country, and felt an honest pride in placing the aristocracy of wealth, in this manner, by the side of the aristocracy of birth.* chants, and also as I myself can vouch from what I have seen.

The London of those times, however, was not the London with which we are familiar. About the middle of this reign acts were passed which required that the road over Holborn hill and through St. Giles's, and that leading from Temple Bar to Westminster, should be paved \u2014 made hard with stone of some description. Gray's Inn -lane, Chancery-lane, Fetter-lane, and Shoe-lane are all de scribed as thoroughfares where the roads are 'very ' foul, full of pits and sloughs, very perilous and ' noisome for all the king's subjects, as well on horse ' back as on foot and in carriages ;' and the inhabitants are required to cover the space before their respective houses with fixed stones. The sides of the great road from the bottom of Snow-hill to Tyburn, were then only partially built upon. The same was the case with the space now known as the Strand.* But if the streets and lanes of London were much less agreeable as thoroughfares in that age than in our own, the Thames was much more attractive to pleasure-seekers than at present. The city was not then so large as to affect its purity, the traffic upon it was not so great as to leave small space to those who would float upon its surface in holiday seasons ; while on its bosom Southampton, Poole, and even Plymouth and Portsmouth, are among the places which suffered from this artificial influence. \u2014 Anderson's Hist.

That royal bird was then accounted a dainty dish, and was brought to table where the richest fare was expected.* The houses forming the streets of London were such Architec as they had been long before, and such as they con tinued to be long afterwards. Boots steeply pointed, stories one projecting over the other, with a plastered surface worked into arches, panels, or according to some other notions of ornament, and the corners beneath the floor of each story, supported often by ob truding figures, of very rude and unsightly workman ship. In ordinary buildings, the use of brick may be said to have been unknown. The cottages of the peasant class were described by a foreigner as formed of ' sticks and dirt,' that is, of wood and clay ; and buildings of a superior description were rarely constructed of material more durable than wood and plaster. The narrowing space formed by these ancient houses, projecting, as they rose in height, might suggest that the object of the architect was to secure large floorings at a small ground rent ; and as ground within a walled town was always so valuable, it is not improbable that they were somewhat influenced by that consideration. But so long as they were obliged to build with such perishable material, no other form could have been so well adapted to protect the surface against weather. Erasmus complains that the windows, which should have permitted ventilation, were gene rally fast, while the walls, which should have precluded wind and weather, too often allowed inconvenient access to 'both.

In the change which came over the higher order of domestic architecture about this time we see_ signs of the change which was rapidly taking place in the structure of society. Castles built of stone, and de signed as fortresses, cease to make their appearance as in past times. Those which exist are for the most part dismantled, or gradually become more domestic than military in their aspect. It belongs to the king and the government to rear and perpetuate places of strength, not to the subject. The halls of nobles, and even the palaces of the sovereign, are valued as models of taste, more than as places that could stand a siege. These were the signs of a momentous revolution. They proclaimed everywhere, that feudalism had done its work \u2014 that a new and better order of society had been inaugurated. What is called the Tudor style in archi tecture is not easy to describe. It was not classical \u2014 it was not Gothic. It was a fanciful mixture of both, including elements which had been imported from the East. Native and foreign artists made their contribu tions to it. From this time, no one attempted to rival the grand specimens of pure Gothic, which, in our cathe drals, had done so much credit to English taste during the Middle Age. Only partial imitations of the past, in that respect, are to be expected from the time to come.

It abounds with every article of luxury, as well as with the necessaries of life ; but the most remarkable thing in London is the wonderful quantity of wrought silver. In one single street, leading to St. Paul's, there are fifty-two goldsmiths' shops, so rich and full of silver vessels, great and small, that in the shops in Milan, Bome, Venice, and Florence put together, I do not think there would be found so many of the magnificence that are to be seen in London. These great riches of London are not occasioned by its inhabitants being noblemen or gentle men ; being all, on the contrary, persons of low degree, and artificers who have congregated there from all parts of the island, and from Flanders, and from every other place.'\u2014 A Relation of the Island of England,^, 43."], [351, "ENGLAND UNDER THE FIRST REFORMATION. 329 in a special relation to Romanism, and the great re- book vi, action against the religion of the Romanized states cf^J' upon the continent, came to be a reaction, in some degree, against the tastes, as well as against the faith, of those nations. It was seen how the arts had been allied with a debasing superstition, especially in Rome, and never more than within the last hundred years ; and not a few felt towards them as Hezekiah felt towards the serpent of brass, that ' brazen bauble' which his subjects were bent upon worshipping. England had now some weighty duties to discharge, both towards God and humanity ; and until certain great results on which the significance of religious and social life was dependent should be secured, the external refinements and ornamentations of existence were left compara tively to bide their time. It was not that the English men who had imbibed the reforming spirit were deficient in culture. It was rather that their culture was of too high an order to terminate in art. Their minds had become intent upon the beautiful and the grand in the region of realities, not in the region of mere imita tions. The fine arts do not make nations great. They come in the wake of greatness, and have often contri buted their share towards bringing that greatness to an end. They were at their highest when the wave of Greece crested and disappeared. It was so with old Rome. For the moderate patronage bestowed on art in this country during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, there are reasons to be assigned which no Englishman need blush to avow. But what was the general state of knowledge and General of literary culture during the reign now under review ? In these respects we have not a favourable report to make. Great events had preceded the accession of Henry state of VIII. Columbus had discovered the new world. Vasco^r\u00c6 de Gama had made his memorable passage to India by r^y cul the Cape. The coasts of North America had been explored by the Cabots of Bristol. The French and"], [352, "330 NATIONALISTS AND ROMANISTS. BOOK VI, Chap. s. Spanish monarchies, after centuries of weakness and conflict, had been consolidated. The weakness, the trea sures, and the fame of Italy, had attracted the cupidity and vanity of diplomatists and potentates. The com merce and policy of England were powerfully affected by those events, but their influence on the knowledge and literary culture of our ancestors was not so great as might have been expected. For a time, as we have seen, a hopeful impulse was given to the mind of this country by the new learning. But the uncertainty and violence of the king's temper grew with his years ; and his unsettled policy, and the many cares which he brought upon himself, left him little power or incli nation to make himself felt as a patron of literature. Before his death, the learning of Oxford and Cam bridge had sunk very low. Some attempt was made to revive it under Edward ; but revival can hardly be said to have taken place until some while after the accession of Elizabeth.* The progress made in physical science was very limited. Alchemy, and astrology, and belief in other occult influences, remained much as in the past. In all countries, indeed, the age Was, in this respect, the age of Baracelsus and of Cornelius Agrippa. Mathematics and medicine were mixed up with such influences. But the signs of improvement were most visible in those studies. Even in geography, it is justly said, that ' the acquaintance of Europe with the rest of the ' world, could as yet be only obtained orally from Spa ' nish or Bortuguese sailors or adventurers, and was ' such as their falsehood and blundering would impart. 'f Mental speculation was somewhat less stationary than natural science.

Men like Cromwell and Bole HAF' ' were evidently familiar with the writings of the great Italian. More's Utopia, imaginative as it is, and in consistent as it is, both with itself, and with the known principles of the writer, indicates a strong movement of thought in the direction of some better construction of society. The treatise under the title of the Governor by Sir T. Elyot, might have been expected to furnish additional evidence as to the conception possible to an intelligent Englishman in that age on the science of government. But his work does not accord with its title. It has been rightly described as treating of education rather than of government. What our ancestors were capable of thinking on political ques tions, in the time of Henry VIII. , we shall best learn by observing what they did in relation to them. The great characteristic of our prose literature Literature during this period consists in its simplicity. No- ~ pr08< thing could be more natural. In verse men might be fantastical without limit; but it seems to have been tacitly understood, that in prose, authors were to write as they were accustomed to speak. The pe dantries and conceits so observable in our prose litera ture under Elizabeth, had no place in it before that time. Dudley, the colleague of Empson in his extor tions, was a man of learning, had been speaker of the house of commons, and wrote a treatise in prison intitled, The Tree os the Commonwealth, which shows what good English prose was at the beginning of this century. But the man holding the first place as a prose writer in this age is Sir Thomas More. Dispense with the old orthography, and his English, especially in some of his letters, shows that our language had then become nearly all we now find it. It is the English of the time of Henry VIII., and eminently the English of Tyndale, that has become familiar to us in our Bibles, and in the Book of Common Brayer."], [354, "332 NATIONALISTS AND ROMANISTS. BOOK VI. Chap. 5. Poetry- Skelton, Wyatt and Surrey. In poetry, we have the names of Skelton, Wyatt, and Surrey, as belonging to this period. Skelton, though a priest, was a severe censor of the manners of the clergy. His invectives against Wolsey obliged him to seek refuge in the sanctuary at Westminster, where he ended his days. No poet since Chaucer had delineated character with the same freedom, vigour, and reality. But Skelton was mainly a satirist, and a coarse one, \u2014 coarse even for the time in which he lived.* The transition is great in this respect, from his pages to those of Wyatt and Surrey. Of these writers it is said, that ' they modelled their poetry on ' the same originals ; they cultivated the same class of ' subjects, and were the first to treat the passion of love ' in a refined and courtly spirit. Their sympathies ' carried them in the same direction, and led them to ' prosecute the same ends ; and in both there was a ' purity of taste and morals which rejected alike the ' corruptions, pedantries, and licentiousness of their ' age. To these circumstances may be referred the ' homogeneity of character which has linked their names ' together almost as inseparably as those of Beaumont ' and Fletcher The comparison between ' them on general grounds, must unhesitatingly be ' admitted to be largely in favour of Surrey. He was ' more impassioned, and had a finer sensibility, and a ' more exact taste. But Wyatt possessed high merits ' of another kind. His verse is more thoughtful than ' Surrey's ; more compressed and weighty. He uses ' comparatively few expressions that are not intelligible ' to the modern reader. His vocabulary is extensive, ' and imparts constant novelty to his descriptions.'! We scarcely need say that Sir Thomas Wyatt and the Earl of Surrey were courtiers. Their poetry reflected their own refinement. But the reign of Henry VIII. * The Poetical Works of John Skelton, with Notes, and some Account of the Author and his Writings. By the Bev.

It was not England taking no part in continental politics, except as consisting in efforts to possess herself of the soil of France, \u2014 it was England acting as an influential power in relation to the struggle nearly always going on between the great monarchies of Europe. It was not England as proud of her orthodoxy, and boasting of her unwavering fidelity to the chair of St. Beter, \u2014 it was England as severed from the spiritual supremacy of Rome, as fixing on that supremacy the brand of usurpation, as declaring the Bishop of Bome to be simply the bishop of that diocese, and as subordinating its own clergy in all things to the sovereignty of the civil power. It was not England as in the hands of a king and his ministers with little or no check from the influence of a parliament, \u2014 it was England with the recognition of a high authority in the representatives of the nation, an authority deepened and made strong by frequent assemblies and frequent acts, though often neutralized, under various pretences, by the power of the crown.

BOOK VI. Chap. S. Character of Henry VIII. in the sight of past and present. great maxim that no Englishman should - be taxed without his consent. Nor was it England as submitting to severe laws and an arbitrary policy, from an indif ference to liberty, \u2014 it was England, in a much greater degree, as rising up against such forms of oppression, and as submitting to lesser evils from the rule of a king and his ministers, rather than hazard far greater from the rule of the pope and the hierarchy. It was, indeed, England, with many harsh laws, harshly ad ministered ; with an amount of crime and vagrancy beneath the surface of society, which no laws seemed to reach; with a labouring class, whose toil yielded them but a poor subsistence ; with manufactures and trade hemmed in on all sides by fiscal restrictions and monopolies ; and with physical science and polite lite rature in no flourishing condition. But the crisis in our history in which an old order of society was to pass away, and another was to acquire place and sta bility, was naturally a crisis of stern conflict ; and if the lot of the lowest class of the people was very low, the yeomanry of the land were well- conditioned men ; the artificers, in town and country, were in easy circum stances ; the merchant could send his ships to every part of the world ; the city alderman could adorn the open landscape with edifices which vied with the homes of nobles ; and everywhere, though much error and dis order are visible, and much has to be learnt andunlearnt, it is easy to see that the intelligence and the moral nature of a great people have been called, in a hopeful measure, to their work, and that though the future may include action and re-action, the issue will be, that the withes of a decayed superstition, and of a med dling and foolish legislation, will be snapped asunder, and the strong man will be seen in his time to revel in his strength. No intelligent reader can need to be reminded that there is a wide, and apparently irreconcilable difference, between the character of Henry VIII. as estimated by the great majority of his contemporaries, and as esti-"], [357, "ENGLAND UNDER THE FIRST REFORMATION. 335 BOOK VI, Chap. 5. mated by men of later times. As we look on this picture and on that, we feel obliged to suspect that neither can be more than partially truthful. We are prompted to say, that the man concerning whom such impressions have existed must have been a man capable of harsh and cruel deeds, but that he could not have been wholly devoid of better qualities. What then were the grounds of the affectionate loyalty with which the English people seemed to regard the sway of this monarch ? Henry, it should be remembered, came to the throne at an age which was sure to enlist the popular feeling in his favour. He was not so young as to leave the nation wholly in doubt concerning his character, and all that was known of him seemed to promise that his reign would be a welcome contrast to that of his pre decessor. To the gloomy distrust, the severity, and the money-loving temper of his father, Henry opposed a frankness, a geniality \u2014 a temper and tastes so tho roughly English, that men felt everywhere as if pass ing from the cloud to the sunshine. During many years the impression thus made was perpetuated, pre paring the people to judge charitably when the time came in which there was only too much room for the exercise of such judgment. When attempts are made to raise money by loans and benevolences, rather than by consent of parliament ; when the purpose of the sums thus raised is to be war with Spain and the Netherlands, which was to increase the public burdens, and to destroy the power of bearing them ; when the two houses are required to pass sanguinary laws, and to cede power in so many dangerous forms to the crown ; and when the people are seen to be so far sub missive to all this, \u2014 the conclusion forces itself upon us, that there must have been some special and strong reasons on the side of such submission, or it would never have taken place. We have seen how the citizens of London, and the industrious classes else where, could resist the attempts of Wolsey to tax"], [358, "336 NATIONALISTS AND ROMANISTS. BOOK VI Chap. 5. them illegally. We have seen that when the bad pobcy of the cardinal had brought great distress on artisan and peasant, in Suffolk and in other parts, the people rose in insurrection. We have seen, also, that when two dukes assembled men to suppress this dis order, these armed men were heard to say \u2014 We are ready to protect the persons and properties of your lordships, but we are not ready to use our weapons against our starving countrymen. We know also that the citizens and yeomen who so spoke, were only a fair sample of the armed citizens and yeomen of all England. Why then did a people of this temper, all with arms in their hands, submit to such a rule as that of Henry VIII. \u2014 a rule under which they might find themselves at the mercy of judges who held their office during good behaviour, and were often among the most servile of instruments ; at the mercy of juries who might be fined and imprisoned for their verdict at the pleasure of the court ; and at the mercy of the Star Chamber, where royal proclamations and royal caprice came ordinarily into the place of statute law and common law ? One reason of this passiveness will be found in the fact, that the policy of Henry towards the mass of his subjects was to a great extent a policy of comparative leniency. He was not so jealous of noblemen as his father, but he was not free from that feeling. His two great ministers, Wolsey and Cromwell, were not men from the great families, but were men of humble origin. He could often refuse to see things not agreeable to him in the conduct of the people. But he never failed to see and to punish disaffection in men of rank. Flebeian rebels he could sometimes pardon. Towards noblemen who became traitors he showed no mercy. He had accordingly few real friends among those boasting of their aristocratic blood. The feeling of the upper house was not with him, and he knew it. His strength lay with the house of commons, and with the people. It was es-"], [359, "ENGLAND UNDER THE FIRST REFORMATION. 337 BOOK VI. Chap. 5. pecially thus in regard to his reforming policy. The majority of the lords were not in favour of such changes ; but they were changes in harmony with the opinion and feeling of the better informed and more energetic portion of the people. The south of Eng land was then, as it had always been, greatly in ad vance of the north, and in that more favoured divi sion of the kingdom the new opinions were rife on all hands. The subjects of King Alfred \u2014 the men of the old kingdom of Wessex, were still in the van of British civilization. As we have said before, the king, who promised only a partial relief from the ecclesi astical oppressions to which these people had been so long subject, might ask much at their hands, and not be refused. The iron of that sort of tyranny had entered into their souls, penetrating their thoughts that those thoughts might be converted into crimes, entering the sanctuary of man's dearest affections, and arraying the nearest kindred \u2014 even husband and wife and parent and child \u2014 against each other, for their common degradation and destruction. Well they knew, that heavy as was the yoke which their king was at times disposed to lay upon them, it was light in comparison with that which his strong hand had broken and cast away. They coveted a milder disci pline and greater liberty ; but they knew that resist ance to Henry would probably be anarchy in the state, and the old sway restored to the church. During the first half of his reign, the feeling of Henry was with the new learning, and was in nearly all respects the feeling of the better class of his subjects ; and his policy did not assume a severe tone, until the libera tion of his people from the Bomish tyranny had bound them to him by ties which could hardly be broken. It was not a new thing in our history for subjects to make the power of the crown their refuge from a less endurable power elsewhere, and at no juncture had there been greater wisdom in that policy. Even the protection laws in trade, were regarded, in those days, 11 z"], [360, "338 NATIONALISTS AND ROMANISTS. BOOK VI. Chap. 5. as evidences of the patriotism and humanity of the sovereign. But while the above facts help us to account for the loyal feeling with which Henry VIII. was re garded by a large portion of his subjects, there are other facts belonging to his history which are sufficient to account for the less favourable judgment concerning him which has prevailed in more recent times. By Bomanists, in that day and since, every possible slander has been heaped upon his memory. Some effect would be produced even by libels so overwrought. But discarding calumny, and after all that may be said concerning the nature of the crisis, and the state of society, Henry's later conduct towards Catherine ; his savage course of proceeding in regard to Anne Boleyn; his marrying Jane Seymour the day after that injured woman's execution ; his sending a second wife to the scaffold, even supposing her guilty ; the disgusting affair in the case of Anne of Cleves ; the abandonment of Wolsey and Cromwell to their fate when the time came in which as tools they could be used no longer ; the relentless injustice which disposed of Fisher, More, and other victims, that the doctrine of the ecclesias tical supremacy might be maintained ; the policy which spared the sincere Brotestant as little as the conscientious Bomanist ; the monstrous assumptions set forth in the Six Articles, and the atrocious penal ties by which they were to be sustained ; added to all this, the enforcement of proclamations as having the authority of laws, the dispensing with laws, and the things done without any colour of law- \u2014 all com bine to present a picture which might well be held up, not as a model of kingly rule, but as a beacon to warn subjects of what may follow when princes are allowed to surrender themselves to sensuous and selfish passions, to lawlessness and a spirit of revenge."], [361, "BOOK VII.

The most earnest and devout book vii. men among the Nationalists during the last reign C_H^_' were now to become Brotestants ; and the men who opposed this Brotestant pariyT, did so, not under Bomanist colours, but as Anglo-Catholics, pleading that religious matters should be allowed to remain in the state in which the late king had left them, until \u2022 his successor should be of age. Under this pretext, some hoped simply to prevent further innovation ; while others, who were disposed to restore the old order of things, were desirous of seeing as little as possible done that might need to be undone. Bomanism, as an avowed faith, seemed to have almost passed away, and the fight came to be, for the time, between those who took their stand on the Nationalism of the last reign, and those who were intent on pass ing beyond that landmark, and on becoming some thing more Brotestant. The first movement in opposition to the Brotestant case of party, and especially to Somerset, was made by the chancei- Wriothesley, the chancellor. Wriothesley had been lor very zealous in support of the Six Articles, and had shown no pity in his attempts to enforce them. It was this man, the reader will remember, who, while holding this high office, had strained the rack with his own hands, to extort confessions from Anne Ascue. He was now at the head of the Anglo-Catholic party in the council. It was with the intention of employing himself more effectually in counteracting the reform ten dencies evinced by the Frotector and his supporters, that Wriothesley took upon him to place his chan cellorship in commission. He deputed four lawyers to discharge the duties of that office in his stead. But both the bench and the bar complained of this proceeding as without precedent. Two of the persons appointed, moreover, were canonists, and the authority of the common law in that court could not fail, it was said, to be impaired by such influence. So the"], [364, "342 PROTESTANTS AND NATIONALISTS. BOOK VII. Chap. i. March Misrepre- sentation of the Protec tor. , measure which was to have set Wriothesley at liberty to compete with the Beformers, placed him at their mercy. His haughty and insolent bearing when first questioned concerning what he had done, only hastened his fall. The council declared that he had ceased to be chancellor, and made him liable to fine and imprisonment at the king's pleasure. He was deprived of his office, and the tacit condition of his not being subjected to imprisonment and forfeiture was, that he should acquit himself with more modesty and submission in the time to come. This happened within three months after the accession of the new king. From that time the reform feeling in the council became thoroughly ascendant.* It has been often said, that this resistance on the part of the chancellor, furnished Somerset with a pre- text for seeking an enlargement of his powers as pro- tector, and that he, in fact, succeeded in rendering himself independent of the council, by an instrument drawn up for that purposes But after reading this instrument with some attention, we are disposed to think that it can hardly be said to have invested the duke with any new authority. It simply professes to set forth in ' writing,' what had hitherto been declared only ' by word of our mouth.' The commission is described as ' a charge and commission given unto our ' said uncle and council' The only words in it which seem to lend a sanction to the imputation mentioned, are those which allow the acts of the Brotector to be legal, if done with the concurrence of such advisers as he should ' think meet to call to his assistance.' But this option seems to have had respect to the supplementary committee of councillors, which, from the first, might or might not be summoned ; or it may have been intended to ensure that the decisions of the board should not be wanting in authority, though some of its members, from reasonable causes, should not have been * Burnet, i. 28-31:.

That it was book vii intended to empower the Brotector to dispense with the cj^_' council, or to pack it according to his humour, is a supposition at variance with the tenor of the docu ment, and to the last degree incredible.* But what places this matter beyond dispute is the fact, that when the members of this council preferred their accusations against Somerset, at the time of his fall, their charge on this point was, not that he had possessed himself of a commission to act independently of them, but that in so acting he had, from first to last, violated pro visions by which he professed to be bound. f The course that should be taken in regard to religion was the first and great question to be deter mined by the council. Somerset and Cranmer were the leading spirits in favour of a greater change. But it became them to consider well how far the nation, or the most intelligent and influential portion of it, might be expected to go with them in such a policy.- It seems only reasonable to suppose, that men so familiar with public life, had better means of knowing the state of feeling about them than we can possibly possess. Their conclusion manifestly was, that the tendencies of opinion, and the authority of parlia ment, would be found sufficiently Brotestant to sustain them in the further reformation on which their hearts were set. Should they be disposed somewhat to strain their authority for this object, it would be, as they believed, on the side of that portion of the mind of the country which was really ascendant, and which ought to govern. Somerset felt as one in the place * Burnet, iii. Collect.

Opposition to image worship. of an old Hebrew king, and aspired to be numbered with the men of that class who were commended as doing good and not evil. Cranmer, too, remembered the zeal of the Hebrew priest and prophet, and hoped to be found faithful. In those days men lived, lord cardinals and hill-preachers alike, in the region of such ideas. No feature of Bomanism is so generally and deeply offensive to the Brotestant as the worship which is so openly rendered in that church to images and relics. Differences in speculation are often obscure and tri- vial in popular apprehension, compared with differ- ences which affect external forms. It is not surprising, accordingly, that the first manifestation of the sup- pressed Brotestant feeling of the country should have been in an assault upon image worship. The curate and churchwardens of St. Martin's, in Ironmonger- lane, London, removed images, pictures of saints, and ct crucifix, from the walls of that church, and set up texts of scripture, and the king's arms, in their place. Bonner, bishop of London, and the Lord Mayor, com- plained of these proceedings to the council. Grave deliberations followed. The Anglo -Catholics, of whom Bonner was a conspicuous representative, would have inflicted a signal punishment on these delinquents, that others might be deterred from following so dan- gerous an example. But Cranmer reminded such persons that the late king had decided that all images which had been superstitiously used should be de- stroyed, and argued, that inasmuch as it was not pos- sible to say what images were or were not so used, the wisest course would be to abolish the worship of such objects altogether. So a mitigated sentence was passed on the zealous curate and his friends. They were reprimanded, and required to provide another crucifix, but nothing was said about restoring the paintings and the other images. Gardiner took special umbrage at some proceedings of this nature in his diocese. He wrote to the Brotector, urging vehe-"], [367, "ECCLESIASTICAL REFORMATION UNDER EDWARD VI. 345 mently, that a profanation of sacred things of which book vii, even Luther would not have been guilty, should be Chap' \" stayed. The reply of the Brotector presented a good summary of Brotestant reasons against image worship, and the bishop at once saw that no assistance towards his object was to be obtained from that quarter.* The next question of a religious nature which came Questions up in the council, related to the alleged efficacy of private masses for the dead. It was found that Henry had mas8es left an endowment in his will to perpetuate services of this description for the health of his soul. Some scruple was felt about acting on this portion of that document. It was evident, from his suppressing the monasteries, and so completely alienating their lands, that Henry could not have attached any great value to such services. It was stated, moreover, as a fact of great importance, and well known, that before his decease, his majesty had resolved to make great alter ations, and was contriving 'how to change the mass ' into a communion.' It was not therefore in accord ance with the real will of the late king, that such services should be instituted in his own case, or that church affairs in general should remain stationary. f Cranmer, sustained by the Brotector, and by the Jnja\",c!'on* i-i \u2022 i \u2022 i iii issued by Brotestant party m the council, arranged that an the council ecclesiastical visitation should take place through o7tnewh'oi\u00ab the whole kingdom. The country was divided for Mnsdom' this purpose into six districts. The visitors for each circuit consisted of two gentlemen, a civilian, a divine, and a registrar. The articles of instruction given them required, that the wholesome proclamations of the late king against the pretensions of the bishop of Bome, and in discouragement of superstition, should be republished ; that all images to which pilgrimages were made, or offerings were presented, should be re- * Burnet, iii. 16\u201423.

Via media course of the Re- formers, moved ; that the epistle and gospel read at high mass should be in English; that the litany used in pro cessions should also be in English, as commanded by the late king ; that on every Sunday and holiday, a chapter should be read out of the New Testament at matins, and out of the Old Testament at evening song, in English ; that the clergy should be careful to qualify themselves for giving sound scriptural guidance and comfort to the sick ; that holidays, de signed to promote devotion, but which had become the occasion rather of all kinds of wickedness, should be seasons for reading the scriptures, for attending prayer and the communion, and for offices of charity; that the people should be taught to respect all cere monies not abrogated by authority, and not to despise priests, but to show them reverence for ' their work's ' sake ;' that they should regard charity to their neigh bours, as of much more virtue than pilgrimages to shrines, and should abstain from certain heathenish ceremonies savouring much more of magic than of the gospel ; that prayer should be offered ' for souls de ' parted this life;' and, finally, that the bishops should see that these injunctions were duly observed.* It will be seen from these requisitions that the Beformers in the council were taking their measures with a discreet mixture of firmness and caution. There was little in the injunctions enumerated to which exception could be taken. The authority of Henry, as head of the church, had come to be a very large authority. That authority was supposed to have devolved on the government which he had ap pointed to act as in his name, until his son should be of age. In this view, the council might plead, that, in so far, at least, they had precedent sufficient for doing * Foxe, v. 706-714 Cranmer was the only prelate on this commis sion.

But the Beformers did not confine book vii themselves within these limits. The great innovation Chap '' in this stage of proceedings, consisted in the publica tion of Cranmer's book of homilies, and in the place assigned among the means of popular instruction to the paraphrase on the New Testament by Erasmus. The homilies were designed to be read by all preachers. The work b}r Erasmus was to be placed, in an English translation, in all churches, that all persons so dis posed might read it. These publications were charged with the seeds of a Brotestant theology beyond any thing found in the standards of doctrine hitherto sanctioned by the English legislature. The policy of Cranmer, however, was still to keep a middle course. While inclined to put an end to the system which had taught an ignorant people to be lieve that priestly absolution, like some performance in magic, settled everything, he was concerned to guard such persons as had taken up the new learning against supposing that salvation could come by the mere faith of such learning, any more than by the mere ritualism of the old system. To mark out a path, removed to an equal distance from an antinomian Pro testantism on the one hand, and from a superstitious Bomanism on the other, was the object attempted by the primate in this volume of discourses. One of these sermons set forth the Lutheran doctrine of justification by faith in distinct and emphatic terms. Of course, such a publication would never have ap peared if the government could have confided in the capacity and disposition of the clergy to acquit them selves in a satisfactory manner as public instructors. To issue such a volume, and to make such a use of the work of Erasmus, were bold measures, considered as resting purely on the authority of the council. But, if not strictly constitutional, it was sufficiently known, that the men who were most inclined to denounce them on that ground, were men who had given their sane-"], [370, "348 PROTESTANTS AND NATIONALISTS. BOOK VII, Chap. i. tion to proceedings much more open to such exception during the last reign.* These transactions belong to the spring and sum mer of the year which opened with the accession of Edward VI. During those months the relations of England to the continent, and the affairs of Scotland, made a large demand on the care of the Brotector. Through the last two years the council of Trent had been dragging its dreary length along ; and the policy of France, of Spain, of the papacy, and of Germany, had presented its old mixture of civil and religious embroilment, and its wonted fertility in cross pur poses. The war against the German Protestants, to which Baul III. had stimulated Charles in 1546, had not been successful ; and on the death of Henry VIII. the pontiff would gladly have roused the emperor to send his imperial forces against England. But Charles had too much upon his hands elsewhere to allow of his committing himself to such an enterprise. The death of Francis I. soon after that of Henry VIII. , placed the sceptre of France in the hands of Henry II., a mo narch whose feelings were strongly hostile to this country. Boulogne was in the hands of the English, according to treaty, for the next eight years. There were circumstances which seemed to indicate that neither Henry nor Somerset would scruple to infringe this compact, if a decent pretext for so doing might be urged. This irritation in France extended itself to Scotland, where the French party, under Cardinal Beaton, had recently succeeded in frustrating the efforts of England to bring the two kingdoms into nearer amity, by contracting a marriage between Mary Stuart and Edward. Henry VIII. had been concerned that the opponents of this marriage should be crushed by force, if the end could not be otherwise accom plished. Somerset, encouraged by some two hundred noblemen and gentlemen in Scotland, who had secretly * Strype's Eccles. Mem. ii. c. 7. Cranmer, bk. ii. c. 3."], [371, "ECCLESIASTICAL REFORMATION UNDER EDWARD VI. 349 pledged themselves to support this policy, resolved on book vii. an invasion of that country. Early in September, Chap\" '\" the English army marched along the Scottish coast from Berwick to Musselburgh, within sight of their ships and supplies. On the eighth of the month, a par tial engagement took place, which was in favour of the English. Thirteen hundred men, including the best por tion of the Scottish cavalry, were destroyed or disabled. On the following day, Somerset, in the hope of prevent ing a further effusion of blood, proposed that the Scot tish government should promise to allow the young queen to remain free from any matrimonial connexion with France until she should become of a marriageable age, and that she should then be left to her own prefer ence in that respect. Let this very moderate concession be made, and the Brotector pledged himself that the English army should at once return to England. Un fortunately for both countries, the Scotch rejected this overture. The battle of Binkie Cleugh ensued, which placed the country at the mercy of the invaders. Had Somerset made the best of his advantages, all the places of strength in Scotland might have been taken. But the English parliament was just about to meet. The duke's most dangerous enemies were not the enemies he had faced in the field. His presence in England at this juncture was of no small importance. The shame of defeat, and the relentless slaughter perpe trated by the victors, rendered amicable relations between England and Scotland more difficult than ever. But in this country, Somerset was hailed as the hero of the hour. By the parliament, the severe laws which had cha- Parliament racterized the legislation of the late king were promptly jjT-dat?ve \"\" repealed. The new laws concerning treason and chang\". felony, the Six Articles, and the law which had made royal proclamations of the same authority with acts of parliament, all ceased to exist.

Revision of the com- munion service. religion pass unchallenged, but by formal acts of its own, the cup was restored to the laity in the com munion, and an end was put to private masses. The latter measure, by taking departed souls so far out of the hands of the clergy, discouraged for the time an incalculable amount of superstitious fraud.* In the course of the next year, a proclamation was issued which enjoined a respectful conformity to the public service as then recognised ; forbade some usages which had hitherto prevailed ; and especially required that all images to which worship, or offerings of any kind were rendered, should be removed. In the second year also, a commission of prelates and learned men was appointed to revise the offices relating to the communion. By this authority a change was made in the service of the mass, which converted it into a communion service. With this innovation came another, one effected apparently with little difficulty, but of the greatest moment to the future of the Eng lish church and of the English nation. This was a regulation which left the confession preceding absolu tion and communion, to be henceforth confession to a priest, or confession only to God, according to the conscience of the worshipper. This repudiation of the vast and complex system of priestly power, which had been built up on the alleged necessity of confession to a clergyman on the part of all who would be saved, was itself a revolution of the greatest magnitude. Without this change, all other changes would have been comparatively inefficient as means of spiritual, and we may add, of political freedom. This accomplished, the priest could no longer rule in the affairs of this world by wielding the terrors of the next.f Cranmer soon afterwards set forth a catechism on the elements of the Christian religion, which is chiefly remarkable for the earnestness with which it denounces image worship, and as showing, that the * Statutes, i Edw. VI. cc. l, 2, 12. t Burnet, iii. 1 20."], [373, "ECCLESIASTICAL REFORMATION UNDER EDWARD VI. 351 author, while content that confession to a priest should book vii. be left optional, was by no means desirous of seeing CaAF '' that custom wholly abandoned.* But the great event in the ecclesiastical affairs of Origin of 1548 consisted in the instructions given to a commis- coemim$n ' sion of learned men to revise the form of public wor- Frayer ship generally. By these commissioners the first Book of Common Brayer was issued. Barliament, and the two houses of convocation gave their sanction to the new liturgy. f An act was also passed which allowed the clergy to marry, but the bill on that subject did not become law without considerable opposition, j The great difficulty in respect to the Book of Com- Disensdmu mon Brayer related to what should be its teaching the doTt'rine concerning the eucharist. In the summer of 1 549, \u00b0ns^t'u' discussions took place in Oxford and Cambridge, in public, and in the presence of commissioners from the king and council, on that point. Eminent men from the ranks of the foreign Brotestants had been encouraged to settle in England. Beter Martyr had become professor of divinity in Oxford. Bucer and Fagius exercised a similar influence in Cambridge. Beter Martyr's lectures had touched on nearly all the topics of controversy which were then occupying men's thoughts, and his teaching concerning the doctrine of transubstantiation had called forth special disaffection. On this tenet, the adherents to the old and to the new faith were to be especially, and irreconcileably, divided. By the opponents of Beter Martyr it was resolved that he should be challenged to a discussion on a certain day, by Dr. Richard Smith, a man of some mark among them. But the professor was to be in ignorance * Burnet cites this work as showing that the archbishop now fully owned 'the divine institution of bishops and priests.' \u2014 Burnet, iii. 131. f Statutes, 1 Ed.

On entering the hall, at the usual hour, on that day, Beter Martyr found it crowded with persons from the university, and from the town, prepared to uphold the ancient doctrine by noise, if not by argument. When challenged to a disputation, he replied that he was not to be taken thus at un awares ; that he was prepared to meet any man, or any number of men, in discussion, but it must be with time and place, and some other preliminaries, fully settled. It was not found possible to resist the reason ableness of these conditions. The vice-chancellor, who was present, declared that the terms laid down were only just. The result was, that a formal dispu tation took place, which extended over four days. In Cambridge, Bucer conducted a discussion on the same topic, and after the same forms. Bidley, bishop of London, who presided on both these occasions as royal commissioner, declared in favour of the Bro testant disputants. Great progress was thus made towards a repudiation of the Romanist doctrine on that subject.* The doctrine of the Church of England in relation to this article, as now settled, was in some degree peculiar. Three conceptions in regard to the eucha ristic mystery were at this time prevalent. Opposed to the transubstantiation doctrine was Luther's con substantiation, and the more intelligible doctrine of Zuinglius, which accounted the elements of bread and wine as being merely the signs of a spiritual presence. The doctrine of Beter Martyr is not distinguishable from that of Zuinglius. Bucer discoursed somewhat more mystically on the subject, leaving, by the obscurity, and apparently the designed obscurity, of his language, room for some notion as to a kind of presence that has been called a real presence, though in what that reality consisted it was impossible from his words to determine. His influence on this inquiry * Strype's Eccles. Mem. i. cc. 25. Cranmer, c. 13, 14."], [375, "ECCLESIASTICAL REFORMATION UNDER EDWARD VI. 353 was not a, purely good influence. However, in the hook vii. articles of religion, 'published by authority during Chu' '' this reign, and in the Brayer-book itself, as left by Edward, anything resembling the doctrine of tran substantiation was carefully avoided.* The Brayer-book sanctioned by convocation in the second year of Edward VI. differed in some respects from that now in use. Matins and evening song began with the Lord's prayer, and ended with the third collect. The litany was placed after the com munion service. There was no direction for its use as a part of morning prayer. The address to the Virgin Mary, and similar invocations to the angels and the patriarchs, which Henry had allowed to remain, were now omitted. The communion service began with an Introit or psalm, sung as the minister ad vanced towards the altar. The decalogue was not read. The prayers differed more in arrangement than in other respects, from our present form. In the praise offered for the saints, the name of the Virgin Mary was especially mentioned. In the consecration, the minister prayed that the elements might be sanctified by the Holy Ghost, and by the Word. Water was mixed with the wine. The sign of the cross was retained in the eucharist, in confirmation, and in the visitation of the sick. Baptism was by triple immersion, and was accompanied by exorcising and anointing. In the burial service prayer was offered for the deceased person. f But in the following year the book was again sub- second re mitted to revision, and Bucer was consulted on this \u2122\u2122 \u00b0ff\"'e important subject. His suggestions indicate that common much remained to be done. He advised that there Bu\u00abr4~ should be a stricter discipline to exclude scandalous suesest'ons * Strype's Cranmer, 283-291. Eccles.

BOOK VII, Chap. i. livers from the communion; that the old clerical habits should be laid aside, since by many they were used superstitiously, and pious men were not disposed to use them ; that the people should be required to commune more frequently than once a year ; that the priest should place the sacramental bread in the hands of the people, not in their mouth ; that all prayer for the dead should cease ; that the rubric which prayed that the elements might become the body and blood of Christ to the recipient should be discarded, as savour ing too much of the doctrine of transubstantiation ; that the hallowing of water, and the chrism, in baptism, should be laid aside ; that the language of adjuration in the exorcising should be converted into prayer ; that candidates for confirmation should be examined more thoughtfully and scripturally ; that extreme unction, and the chrism in the churching of women, should be abolished ; and that much more care should be shown in the ordination of men by the bishop, the great want of the times being a larger number of duly qualified preachers and pastors.* Many of these suggestions were adopted. In the book as revised a second time, the opening sentences, the exhortation, the confession, and the words of absolution, were placed, as we now have them, at the beginning. The decalogue and the responses were added to the communion service. The name of the Virgin, the thanksgiving for the patriarchs and prophets, the sign of the cross, together with the in vocation of the Holy Ghost and of the Word at the consecration of the elements, and the mixing of water with the wine, were all now omitted. In delivering the bread and wine to the communicants direct men tion of their partaking of the body and blood of Christ was avoided. Brayer for the universal Church was restricted to prayer for the Church militant. In baptism, the triple immersion, the cross, the exorcism, * Burnet, Hist. Res. iii. 286-288."], [377, "ECCLESIASTICAL REFORMATION UNDER EDWARD VI. 355 and the anointing were discarded. In the visitation of book vii the sick, the directions for private confession, the CnAP *' anointing, the mentioning of Tobias and Sarah, and the instructions which required that portions of the consecrated elements should be preserved, were all can celled. In the burial service, prayer for the deceased, and provision for the communion were rescinded. More simple instructions also were given concerning the vestments of the clergy. But the great advance in this revision was, in its more explicit language on the eucharist. It was now distinctly affirmed that Christ is present with the bread and wine only as He is present everywhere in answer to the prayer of the faithful. All these changes in the direction of a more decided Brotestantism, were confirmed by parliament. While some professed reformers accounted the new service-book as going too far, others viewed it as not going far enough ; and this latter party, who were now in the ascendant, succeeded, at the eleventh hour, in appending an explanatory clause about kneeling in the communion. ' It is not meant hereby,' the}T said, ' that any adoration is done, or ought to be done, ' either unto the sacramental bread or wine there bodily ' received, or to any real or essential presence there ' being: of Christ's natural flesh and blood.'* What had been thus done did not obtain the approval of the parliament and convocation before the spring of 1552, and the new book did not come into use before the autumn of that year.f In the meanwhile, Bidley, on visiting his diocese as Edu-y bishop of London, had sent forth admonitions to his S00LL\u2014 clererv, discouraging1 manv trivial customs to which aal,arst,is- o* ' no J plai-ed by table: * Clay, Prayer Book Illustrated, 126.

But the bishop only spoke in the way of exhortation. Some did not obey. Before the close of the year, however, the council spoke in the language of authority, and altars were displaced in all churches by tables, though the use of the words altar and table was left indifferent in the liturgy.* Something had been done towards shadowing forth the theological doctrine of the future English Church by the publication of the Book os Homilies. But it was not until many preliminary matters had been settled, that this weighty subject came under formal consideration. Cranmer and Bidley are supposed to have prepared the substance of the Forty-Two Articles, which were adopted by the laymen and divines of his majesty's council in 1552, and which, with a few subsequent modifications, became the Thirty-Nine Articles, since sufficiently known.- In these Articles, and in the Book of Homilies, we have a sufficient statement and exposition of the theo logy of the Church of England as reformed under Edward VI. Fersons who know anything of the theology of Augustine will readily discover the source whence Cranmer and Bidley derived much of the thought which, in this second reformation, was to become the recognised belief of our national church. Great pains were taken to guard the doctrine of the spiritual helplessness of man through the fall of Adam ; and the doctrine of salvation purely by faith and grace through Christ, against the abuse to which those tenets are liable. Emphatic, too, was the con demnation of the alleged idolatry of the church of Bome in the worship of images, and other objects ; * Foxe, vi. 5\u20147."], [379, "ECCLESIASTICAL REFORMATION UNDER EDWARD VI. 357 and not less earnest was the inculcation of the doc- book vii. trine of passive obedience. Even wicked rulers, it CHAr- '\u2022 was said, should be accounted as responsible only to God. Happily, England was not to believe in this servile teaching. The hierarchy was retained sub stantially in the form in which it exists at present, though Cranmer had taught that the offices of bishop and priest ' were both one office in the beginning of ' Christ's religion.' The substance of the old ritual also was perpetuated, but with many modifications. The Brayer-book of 1552 was the production of times The Prayer too unsettled, and came from minds too little in har- anaiiy re mony, and subject to too many opposition influences, E'dwardder to be remarkable for consistency. The book to be revised was itself full of medi\u00e6valism. Some of the commissioners were disposed to retain as much as possible of that element Others looked not to fathers or schoolmen, so much as to the more advanced men among the continental reformers. Hence the volume was found to resemble a piece of mosaic, rather than a developed unity. Hoary fragments from the past, stood side by side with some of the most startling novelties from the present. The teaching of the book was teaching wholly from bygone times, and this was to be only partially displaced by contributions which could be traced to such modern thinkers as Luther and Melancthon, Zuinglius, Beter Martyr, and Bucer. Hence it continued to be episcopal, but not without some infusion of Bresbyterianism. The doctrine con cerning the sacraments is not wholly from Bome, nor wholly from Germany or Switzerland, but retains a midway complexion of its own. Its theology, as we have said, was taken largely from Augustine ; but it gave a Lutheran prominence to the doctrine of justifi cation by faith, and was otherwise so guarded and ex plained, that it seemed to avoid the extremes both of Calvinism and Arminianism. But perhaps the very defects and faults of the book should be accounted an excellence. Such as it was, it had come from the"], [380, "358 PROTESTANTS AND NATIONALISTS. BOOK VII. CnAp. i. mind of the time, and was adapted to it. Men of widely different views, if they found much in it to disapprove, found much to admire. The error was not so much in doing what was then done, as in accounting the possible in 1552, as the best for all coming time. Already there were signs of that great difference of feeling and judgment on such matters, which was to become the source of so much resolute contention, and to end, as we see at this day, in a secession of nearly half the worshippers in the kingdom from the church still claiming to be national. But the revo lution in religion under Edward VI. was a great revolution. The pent-up mind of the country found the vent it had long coveted, aud the impetus was too strong to be resisted."], [381, "CHABTEB II. STRUGGLE BETWEEN PAST AND PRESENT. IT must not be supposed that the succession of book vii, changes described in the preceding chapter took CHAF' *' place without opposition. The }*oung king was much s,atcof influenced by religious feehng, and in so far as years allowed the least weight to be attached to his opinion, the reformers in the council could plead his known preference as in favour of their proceedings. They could look also to the house of commons as sure to be with them. The peers, moreover, though largely dis affected, were constrained to obedience, partly by the share which they had obtained in the church property, and partly by new creations, and by the joint influence, as in time past, of the government and of the lower house. We have seen the failure of Wriothesley's attempt rroce\u00abi to check the tendencies towards reform in his col- Bonner\"\" leagues. But to subdue resistance in the council was not to subdue it in the church. Bonner refused to conform to the injunctions winch the government had sent forth, except in so far as they should be in accordance with the laws of God and of the church. When his lordship was informed that the ' ill example ' of such a reservation in the person of the bishop of London was not to be admitted, the prelate recon sidered the case, and promised everything required. But this was done with so little appearance of sincerity, that as a punishment to himself, and as a warning to others, the bishop was sent for awhile to the Fleet prison. He was released after three weeks, but his imprisonment at all, under such circumstances, was an"], [382, "360 PROTESTANTS AND NATIONALISTS. BOOK VII. Chap. z. unauthorized and unwise proceeding. It did not promise well for the political sagacity of the men into whose hands the cause of reform had now passed.* Bonner was left in the quiet possession of his bishopric during the next two years. Before the close of that interval, however, it had become manifest in many ways, that his submission to the authorities above him had been reluctantly and disingenuously given. What he did in conformity with the injunc tions of the council, he did in the most perfunctory manner, and whatever he could leave undone he did not fail so to leave. The Bomanist party knew that he was altogether with them. But his temporizing conformity was so carried out, that Brotestants found it difficult to bring any distinct and weighty accusation against him. In the summer of 1549 he was sum moned before the council on various charges of remiss ness, enough to show, when taken together, that his sympathies were deeply hostile so the religious policy of the government. Many things which he had not been wont to do he was now required to do ; and he was appointed to preach a sermon at St. Baul's Cross, in which there should be a free declaration of his opinion on some topics, and especially on the point of the king's authority while under age, in relation to affairs both in church and state. But in his discourse this last point was omitted, and in some other respects he failed to express himself in a satisfactory manner. On these grounds, a commission was appointed to examine and judge concerning his case. The conduct of Bonner towards these commissioners was scornful, defiant, insolent. He insisted that he had spoken in his sermon on all the subjects prescribed, except the one relating to the king, and that omission he declared had happened from a failure of memory, and from his notes having become deranged while preaching. In appealing from the commissioners to the king, he spoke * Burnet, iii. 66, 67."], [383, "361 STRUGGLE BETWEEN PAST AND PRESENT. BOOK VII Chap. z. of them as his 'pretended judges.' One witness he de scribed as a goose \u2014 another was a woodcock. The people present, on their showing sympathy with the proceedings of the court, he denounced as dunces and idiots. Hooper he branded as a varies, and an ass. Several examinations took place, in all of which there was much more passion than progress. On one occa sion, Sir Thomas Smith, secretary of state, displeased the angry prelate, whereupon he said \u2014 'As you are a ' privy councillor, I can honour you, but as Sir Thomas ' Smith, I say you are a liar, and I defy you as such.' This was language addressed to a man who had hardly an equal in learning and probity in that age. At another time this model of the meekness proper to the Christian bishop broke out in bitter invective against Cranmer, charging him with having poisoned the mind of the people with his heresies, and warning him that he would some day have to answer sharply for such proceedings. Having appealed to the king, he declined to answer any further questions. Bonner' s great argument against the reform policy of the council had been, that according to law, such measures should proceed from the king ; that the king was not of years to exercise authority in such grave matters; and that thus all that had been done was without any valid basis. It required some effrontery to appeal to the king in person, after having thus openly denied his natural competency to meddle with such questions. According to the theory of Bonner, and of his friend Gardiner, a nation sinks into a state of paralysis so long as a sovereign is underage \u2014 a pro tectorate or a regency is nothing, parliament itself is nothing, for that interval. The demand made on these persons was a demand of obedience to the law, though it was not their pleasure to see it in that light. Even yet, some effort was made to soften the feelings of Bonner, and to render him more practicable. But he was not a man to be influenced by such a policy. He would see in it only the sign of weakness."], [384, "362 PROTESTANTS AND NATIONALISTS. BOOK VII, Chap. z. Prosecution ofGardiner. He was at length condemned as contumacious, and was deprived of his bishopric. This sentence was unavoid able, if the English church was to be Brotestant, and Brotestant at all after the form determined, not, as Bonner affected to think, by Cranmer and the council, but by the two houses of convocation and the two houses of parliament. When, however, the com missioners added imprisonment to deprivation, the justice and the policy of their proceedings were open to grave exception. The best that can be said in their defence is, that Bonner was a recusant who would be sure to convert lenity into licence, and that bearing in mind the temper of the times in relation to such cases, he may be said to have been mildly dealt with in being subject to no heavier penalty.* Gardiner, bishop of Winchester, as the reader has seen, fully sympathized with Bonner. Similar pro ceedings were instituted against him. In the course of more than one examination, he declared himself strongly opposed to the doctrine of justification by faith, as set forth in the homily on that subject, and to the placing of the paraphrase by Erasmus in churches. He cited many things from that work, from the homilies, and from the injunctions issued by Cranmer and the council, as being contradictory, and as opposed to the law of God. Gardiner was no doubt right in affirming that the council had stretched its authority to a questionable degree in some of its pro ceedings. But he knew that such latitude had been assumed by the crown in relation to ecclesiastical affairs in the last reign, when he was himself in the government. He knew also, that however questionable some of the first acts of the council may have been, they had all been confirmed, virtually or directly, by acts of the legislature. Gardiner's real objection was, an objection to the main points of Brotestantism, and to all meddling with religion by the civil power. lie Foxe, v. 717-797; vi. 42-55.

Bad men often invoke laws in their weakness, on which they have trampled in the time of their strength. f Bonner, when he first came into trouble, promised a full submission. Gardiner would not so pledge him self, and was at once imprisoned. Much correspondence took place between him and the Brotector. But diffi culty was not removed by that means. The bishop con tinued under restraint until the close of I.S47- He was then allowed to return to the exercise of his functions at Winchester. But he never ceased to betray his passionate aversion to the course of public affairs. He was, in consequence, again summoned before the council, and on the ground of the neglect and fault attributed to him, and from the impossibility of placing any reliance on his temper or on his professions, he was committed to the Tower, where he remained a prisoner nearly two years. At the close of that interval he was subjected to a series of examinations, similar in all respects to those through which Bonner had passsd. The conclusion was, that Gardiner appealed, as Bon ner had done, from the commissioners to the king, and the same sentence for contumacy, was followed by the same penalties, deprivation and imprison ment. As the church of England was then consti tuted, it was not to be supposed that the episcopal office could be entrusted to such hands. For Gardiner still adhered to the doctrine of transubstantiation. He insisted on the efficacy of masses for the dead. * Within a month after the death of Henry, Gardiner complained in strong terms to Paget, because the bishops, and himself among them, had been required to take out new commissions, binding themselves to recog nise the supremacy of the crown, \u2014 which was in fact objecting to do under Edward as he had done under Henry ! t Foxe, v. 42-55.

Bonner had a right to complain of some hardships to which he was subjected on his first brief imprison- ment. Gardiner, too, might well complain on the ground of being detained a prisoner so long without trial. But in removing such men from all place in the church of England as then established, the states- men of those times discharged an obvious duty.

In the autumn of 1551 he was sum moned before the council, and much effort was made to induce him to reconsider his opinions. But he was not to be moved from the ground he had taken. He was in consequence deprived of his bishopric \u2014 -a loss, he declared, which was a small matter to him, compared with the pleasure of retaining his conscience un sullied. Day was a much less estimable man than Heath. Day. His offence consisted in his refusal to take down the altars in his diocese, and to supply their place with tables \u2014 and in his preaching so as to excite the common people to oppose all such changes. The council seemed as little disposed to proceed to ex tremities with the bishop of Chichester as with the bishop of Worcester. But at the close of a fourth examination, Day also was deprived. These prelates, however, were no longer prisoners. Heath was allowed to reside with the bishop of London \u2014 Day with the bishop of Ely. Day, whose conscience was so tender about substituting tables for altars, lived to gratify his sensibility in religious matters by sending pious men and women to the stake in the next reign.* Tonstal's case was not a case of nonconformity.

But towards the close of 1 55 1, proceedings were instituted against him in the house of lords, on the charge of his having been privy to a conspiracy in the north. Cranmer opposed this action, declaring the evidence insufficient. But the votes were against him. The commons, how ever, insisted that the accused should be placed face to face with the witnesses against him, and the case was dropped.

Disaffection among the inferior clergy. among the papers of the deceased Brotector, which the prelate could not deny to be in his handwriting, and the contents of which convicted him of having been privy to treason without revealing it. Tonstal, in consequence, ceased to be bishop of Durham, and was confined within the liberties of the Tower to the close of this reign.* The remaining bishops were ready conformists, or persons who occasioned little trouble. But the in ferior clergy, with less worldly wisdom, and less to lose, were sometimes difficult to govern. To many of these, the late changes had brought homelessness and want. Not a few of them had been monks, and had been recently expelled from the suppressed monasteries. Many churches had been allied with those religious houses, which commonly absorbed the tithe without giving the parish the benefit of a resident priest. The inroads now everywhere made on that kind of property, had left a large number of livings to be livings only in name. Cures of this description, as signed to the class of persons above mentioned, were generally so poor, that the needy incumbents sold their services in the administration of the sacraments, and especially in singing masses for the dead, at the best price they could obtain, no other means of sub sistence being open to them. The people who desired such services for their departed friends, commonly paid twopence for a mass ; a groat was accounted a liberal acknowledgment.! But now even this source of revenue had failed. Private masses were prohibited. Among persons so conditioned, nothing was more natural than a feeling of disaffection. The clergy in possession of better incomes suffered more or less from the same cause. We must suppose, that in both classes, considerations of a selfish nature were often associated with memories which bound the heart in * Strype's Cranmer, ii. c. 32. Eccles. Mem. bk. ii. c. 15. t Burnet, iii. 210-213."], [389, "367 STRUGGLE BETWEEN PAST AND PRESENT. generous sympathy with things as they had been in book vii, other days. Hence, soon after Edward's accession, CuAP' *; the pulpits of England began to send forth a most uncertain sound. In most country parishes the cry was on the side of the old ways and the old belief's. In towns and cities, the reform feeling was generally strong, and the pulpit orators levelled their artillery against each other, not always in a way tending most to edification or to good neighbourhood. Many con tinued their old teaching in defiance of authority. Many were disposed to innovate without waiting for authority. From the first \u2014 it had been ordered, that no preacher should preach out of his own pulpit with out a special licence. Subsequently, it was deemed prudent to silence preachers for a season altogether. When this season had passed, carefully prepared in junctions were issued directing the clergy how to dis charge their pulpit duties.* Poverty and religious prejudice, which prompted so Popular many ecclesiastics to insubordination, were causes which n\u00b0'a\u00b0i' tended towards still greater disturbance among large classes of the people. In less than eighteen months from the king's accession, there were popular risings over the greater part of England. The first commo tion made its appearance in Hertfordshire, and it passed thence into Somersetshire, Gloucestershire, Wiltshire, Hampshire, Sussex, Kent, Essex, Suffolk, Butlandshire, Warwickshire, Leicestershire, and York shire, becoming especially formidable in Devon and Norfolk. Many writers, in attempting to account for this * ' That you do in all your sermons exhort men to that which is at this time most necessary ; that is, to the amendation of their own lives, to the observance of the commandments of God ; to humility, patience, and obe dience to their heads and rulers ; comforting the weak, and teaching the right way, and to flee all old erroneous superstitions, as the confidence in par dons, pilgrimages, beads, religious images, and other such of the bishop of Rome's superstitions and traditions.' \u2014 Letter to all Preachers, Burnet, iv. Coll. 24."], [390, "368 PROTESTANTS AND NATIONALISTS. BOOK VII Chap. z. Causes of this dis- content. general inquietude, have been disposed to lay the blame largely upon the new government, and especially upon Somerset. The truth is, the disturbance had come from causes, which, for the most part, were much older than the accession of Edward, and which Somerset had done what he could to check and remove. To this time, though hostilities had arisen both with Scotland and with France, no new pecuniary burden had been laid upon the people. The customs had been voted to the crown as usual. But no general subsidy was granted under Edward before the third year of his reign. The new government, accordingly, had done nothing to produce this feeling, except by its religious innovations, and it is certain that nine-tenths of the malcontents were not moved by considerations of that nature, but purely by their social grievances. So far, indeed, as Henry's seizure of the abbey lands may be accounted a religious act \u2014 the religion of the last reign may be said to have done something towards increasing this general restlessness. It had been enjoined on those establishments by the will of the dead, and by the law of the land, that they should be centres of hospitality, and be charitable to the poor. In many instances this obligation had not been well remem bered. But such customs of course wholly ceased when the foundations themselves came to an end. The doles which the idle had been wont to receive at the convent gate had failed, but the mendicant habits which had been thus induced remained. The vagrant classes of those times were scattered by the suppression of the monasteries \u2014 it should always be remem bered, that they were not created by that measure, except as we suppose the monks themselves to have become beggars. But the laymen who came into the place of the ecclesiastics as landlords often added to the number of hard masters. They are said to have exacted higher rents for their estates ; they pur sued the old custom of enclosing land that had been left as common to the poor; and as wool-growing"], [391, "369 STRUGGLE BETWEEN PAST AND PRESENT. BOOK V II, Chap. z. continued to be more profitable than corn-growing, i they were disposed, as their fathers had been before them, to convert much arable land into pasture. By so doing they no doubt lessened the demand for a particular kind of labour. When we remember that Luigi Guicciardini describes the English woollens as among the ' rare and curious' in the great Antwerp fair, and as fetching a high price, no more need be said in explanation of the course taken by the land owners. Somerset saw the suffering from this cause as becoming very formidable, while his colleagues seemed to be little concerned about it. Soon after his accession to office, he issued a proclamation to stay these encroachments on the privileges which the poor had been wont to regard as a kind of right. But the effect of his interference was not so much to make the landlords obedient, as to seem to excuse popular dis order, by ceding that the people had a right to com plain. In the meanwhile, no restraint was laid on marriage, and according to a law natural to such cir cumstances, the lower population only increased the more as the poor became poorer. Many dajrs in the year having ceased to be holidays, the labourer found, that with more time for work, he had less work to do. Food, at the same time, had become unusually dear. Frices, in fact, were rising all over Europe ; and no government should expect to be very popular while markets are dull and bread is not cheap. Nor was it possible that bad times and changes in religion should come together, without the one being more or less regarded as parent to the other. Malcontent monks and priests would not fail to preach zealously about such relations between cause and effect. And while some religious minds looked with a sincere affection to the past, other minds, not at all less religious, drew licence from the present. Delivered from the bondage in which they had been so long held, both \\>y priest and magistrate, these earnest persons were sometimes unduly elevated by their imaginary freedom \u2014 so that II B B"], [392, "370 PROTESTANTS AND NATIONALISTS. BOOK VII, Chap. z. Society in England be for*: flie Re formation. even devout men did not always retain a becoming deference to authority. We read also of a class con sisting of homeless idlers, of felons, prison breakers, pirates, and the refuse of garrisons, who went from place to place to stimulate the people to revolt, in the hope of finding opportunity to plunder the rich, while affecting to be moved by sympathy with the wrongs of the poor.* In truth, if an attempt be made to estimate the influence of the doctrines of the Beformation on the condition of society in England at this time, it is important to remember that there were not a few things in the circumstances and habits of the English people at the opening of the sixteenth century, which were by no means favourable to the appreciation of any teaching of a really spiritual tendency. We have seen that the effects of the wars of the half century which preceded the accession of Henry VII. had been to generate a violent and turbulent temper in all classes. Long indulgence had done much to give root to those passions, to make them strong, and even here ditary. To curb this evil, lords were no longer to have military retainers ; and the laws against crime and va grancy were made to be terrible. When robbery, crime, and idleness abound on the one side, it is only natural that selfishness, covetousness, and hardness of heart should abound on the other. The reader has seen that the enclosure and sheep-walk grievances go back into the last century. Beside the evils which came from this source, were others which came from causes much less obvious, but hardly less potent. The his tory of marriage is very largely the history of society. In those days, the king disposed of his wards in marriage as he disposed of his advowsons ; and in common life, from the keen sense of the value of money which had come to be very prevalent, children were expected to be obedient in that matter to the * Strype's Mem. ii. bk. i. cc. 12-21."], [393, "371 STRUGGLE BETWEEN PAST AND PRESENT. BOOK VII. Chap. z. absolute authority of their parents. Marriage, in conse quence, was too commonly a question of finance, much more than of affection, and the vices natural to such a mode of looking at that relation were known to be common with the highest class, and with many below them. ' In England,' says a foreigner then resident among us, ' I have never noticed any man, either in ' the court or in the lower orders, to be in love. Either ' the English are the most discreet lovers in the ' world, or they are incapable of love. I say this of ' the men.'* The domestic virtues are the root of all virtues, and this marriage law was not favourable to such virtues. The love a man has for his own hearth, is the best guarantee for his love of country ; but mar riages of convenience do not often make home a paradise. The writer above cited further says \u2014 ' This ' people take great pleasure in having a quantity of ' excellent victuals, and also in remaining long at table. ' I have it on the best information, that when war is ' raging most furiously, they will seek for good eating, ' and all their other comforts, without thinking of ' what may befal them :' and almost anything, adds the same authority, may be compensated by money. We may see in this England before the Beformation, a country with an upper and military class hard to be curbed into order ; with a strong mercantile middle class, and a powerful yeomanry, growing in the love of money, and in the love of the sensuous gratifications natural to men whose money has been thus gained ; and below this upper and middle class are the disor dered, idle, and dangerous classes. Some of these last are what they are from causes for which they are not themselves to blame, and some from their being unable or unwilling to cast off the violent or unproductive habits which they have derived from the unsettled state of society about them. Looking to the bulk of the nation, apart from the highest or the lowest, we * A Relation of the Island of England, 24. B B 2"], [394, "372 PROTESTANTS AND NATIONALISTS. BOOK VII. Cuap. z. Insurrec- tions in the provinces may see in them a bluff, brave, independent people \u2014 a people much more independent than the frequently arbitrary proceedings on the part of the government seem to suppose. But they were not a people to be much influenced by very nice distinctions in religion, by mere novelties, or by anything very transcendental on that subject. And while the soil had been thus far unfavourable from the beginning, it had been the work of Henry VIII. to crush the reformation as a spiritual power, in favour of a reformation almost wholly poli tical. The change for the better which had come over the moral and religious feeling of a large portion of his subjects, had come, for the greater part, in defiance of his policy. Henry laid his strong hand on the more turbulent elements of the times, but the less palpable disorders, which were at the root of all the mischief, he never touched. The men, however, who were religious in that age were earnestly religious, and it required all the strong conviction by which their faith was characterized to subdue the tendencies of another kind by which their course was im peded. It was the misfortune of Brotestantism under Edward, that, with a king so young upon the throne, it had to deal, in its early days, with this accumu lated mass of disorder bequeathed to it from the times of another faith. The first signs of discontent in the summer of 1548 did not attract much attention. It was supposed that a little wrise management would suffice to restore quiet. The government issued proclamations pro mising pardon to those who had been engaged in ' routs and uproars,' on condition of their returning peacefully to their homes ; and at the same time announced that commissioners should be appointed to inquire concerning the dearness of provisions, and the grievance of enclosures. Bopular preachers were sent into various parts of the country to reason with the people, and to urge them to obedience."], [395, "373 STRUGGLE BETWEEN PAST AND PRESENT. In many counties the excitement was allayed by such book vii means.* Chap l- But the rising in Cornwall and Devon in 1549 was Rising m not to be so suppressed. In that quarter, and in that Devon' quarter alone, men of some position and influence were found at the head of the malcontents. The name of \u2022 Cardinal Bole was a power in those parts ; and we have reason to believe that he had spared no pains to fan the embers of discontent into a flame. In the other districts, the sources of the inquietude were mainly political, having scarcely any perceptible relation to religious questions. But in the west the insurgents went so far as to demand that Cardinal Bole should be one of the king's council, and, in brief, that the old order of things in religion should be restored. In this connexion, as in many more, the statesmen under Edward VI. had to grapple with the consequences resulting from the violent policy so dominant in the last reign. The severities which crushed the Exeter conspiracy, and the fate especially of the high-minded countess of Salisbury, were not forgotten in the west. The feudal blood of the people was now up, and religious prejudice contributed to make its heat not a little dangerous. The host was carried before the rebels under a canopy. Crosses, and other church emblems, were paraded through town and country. In this manner they laid siege to Exeter, and in such force, that the place must have fallen into their hands, had it not been well fortified, and had it not been defended with great courage and endurance by the citizens. Many attributed this boldness in the rebels to the lenity of the government. ' Mild mea- * One of the commissioners sent by the Protector into the disturbed parts writes \u2014 ' The people in all the circuit that we have passed, who were suspected to be disobedient, and inclined to sedition, we find most tractable, obedient, and quiet, and of such nature that they may be easily brought to do anything that is for God's glory and the king's honour.' \u2014 John Hales to the Protector, July 24, 1548.

Lord Bussell was sent against the besiegers, but could not drive them from their entrenchments. He did not succeed in so doing until reinforced by the German horse under lord Grey, and by some Italian mus keteers under their commander Spinola. Compelled to raise the siege, the retreating force made a skilful use of its cannon, and resisted a succession of attacks. But in about a month from its commencement the rising in the west was put clown. The success of the government in Devon, however, did not prevent the movement in Norfolk from becoming formidable. The disaffected in those parts were led by one Ket, a tanner, a man who had realized considerable property in his trade. The war of Ket's followers was not a war against the new faith, but was altogether of the Jack Cade and Wat Tyler com plexion. Its force was directed against the property and privileges of the gentry. All had conceived, says the Brotector, when writing to the king, ' a wonderful ' hate against gentlemen.' They insisted that there should not be the present distinction between rich and poor ; and that the latter should be raised to places of trust and honour in common with the former. Ket took possession of Norwich, and proclaimed himself king of Norfolk and Suffolk. He instituted courts of law, and heard causes beneath an oak on a hill near the town, which he called the Oak of Beformation. The marquis of Northampton drove the rebels out of Norwich. But the next day he was obliged to evacuate the place, leaving lord Sheffield among the killed. The\" gentlemen of Norfolk and Suffolk now came to the strife, under the command of the earl of Warwick. Even now, the royalists were not at once successful. Ket and his twenty thousand men kept their ground in several encounters. But presently came the want of food. The rebel multitude had fasted three days, when they threw themselves in despair on the king's troops. The result was the"], [397, "375 STRUGGLE BETWEEN PAST AND PRESENT. natural one. Their disciphned antagonists brought book vii. them down by hundreds. Ket himself was among Chap \"' the prisoners, and was hanged some time afterwards. This success in Norfolk made it easy to deal with a similar disturbance in Yorkshire.* During the few years to which this reign extended, The case of the court was scarcely more at rest than the country, admiral. Thomas lord Seymour of Sudeley, lord high admiral, and younger brother to the Brotector, was a man of a restless and ambitious temper. He was handsome in person, courtly in his manners, possessed a ready utterance, and a full senatorial voice. In the hope of realizing his political aspirations, he sought the hand of the widow of the late duke of Richmond, natural son of Henry VIII. Failing in that object, he pre sumed to pay indirect court to the princess Elizabeth, though she was then barely fifteen years of age. But he became the husband of Catherine Parr, the widow of the late king, and was suspected of having hastened the end of that pious and gifted woman, within twelve months from the time of their nuptials. He then turned his thoughts again towards Elizabeth ; and intrigued to retain lady Jane Grey under his influence, either with the vague idea that she might become his wife, or that it might be possible and expedient to bring about a marriage between that lady and the king. In all other connexions, his specula tions were in keeping with these busy schemes in relation to marriage. He had friends among the nobility ; but while his brother was a favourite with the people from his genial nature, the admiral could * Strype's Mem. ii. cc. 12, 21, 27, 28. Cranmer, i. bk. ii. c. 10.

Chap. z. so become only by placing his selfishness and pride under vigorous restraint. He looked with a jealous eye on the power of his brother, as he would have looked on the power of almost any man if above his own. He did all he could to fill the mind of the young king with distrust and hard thoughts con cerning the Brotector, and to organize a powerful faction against him.* When arrested, the object of the admiral had been to make friends among the nobility, and even among the channel pirates, in the hope of becoming strong enough to seize the person of the king, to displace the Brotector, and to assume himself the government both of the sovereign and of the nation. f That the admiral was not on friendly terms with his brother had been long known, and there is evidence enough that the duke expostulated with him, once and again, on his course of proceeding, in a forbearing and con ciliatory spirit. { * Haynes's State Papers, 61 et seq. t In his discourse with the marquis of Dorset, concerning the intended rising against his brother, he said, ' That is well, yet trust not too much to the gentlemen, for they have somewhat to lose ; but I will rather advise you to make much of the head yeomen and franklyns of the country, especially those that be ringleaders, for they be men that be best able to persuade the multitude, and may best bring the number, and therefore I will wish you to make much of them, and to go to their houses, now to one, now to another, carrying with you a flagon or two of wine, and a pasty of venison.

It is strange that Sir James Mackintosh should seem to have written his account of the admiral's case, without even consulting Haynes's State Papers, apart from which he could know next to nothing of the matter. X Somerset, in a letter bearing date 1st Sept., 1548, intimates that the admiral charged him with being willing to receive complaints against him, which the Protector meets by saying, ' How well we do receive them, may appear in our letters, where we lament the case unto you, and exhort, pray, and admonish you so earnestly as we can that you yourself would redress the same \u2014 which were both more honour for you, and quiet and joy and comfort to us.'

But that fact should not \u00b0HAP' l' prevent our stating that the forms of justice were shamefully discarded in the course of proceeding towards him. The bill of attainder against him was read a second time the day after it was introduced, and was passed unanimously on the day following. As usual in cases of attainder, no witnesses were examined in parliament. Judgment was pronounced upon evidence taken by the council and reported by them. Certain peers were deputed to see the admiral in the Tower, but he declined to go into his case with them, and claimed to be openly heard, and to be con fronted with his accusers. This reasonable demand had often been made by men in such circumstances within the last twenty years, and always in vain. It was made in this instance without effect. According to the law as it then stood, lord Seymour had incurred the penalties of treason. But it was not a pleasant sight to look upon the young king signing the death-warrant of an uncle, even though such an uncle ; nor to look on the Brotector signing that warrant against a brother, even though such a brother.* It is to be regretted that imprisonment was not deemed penalty sufficient.

Character and career of War- wick. followed by a rupture between the Brotector and the greater part of the council. Discontent had been long brooding in that quarter. The noblemen and gentle men who shared most in that feeling now withdrew from the court. They appeared about London armed, and with an armed following. They were known to be holding secret consultations hostile to the govern ment.* The nobleman at the head of this conspiracy was the earl of Warwick, and his house, in Ely-place, Holborn, was the centre of the movement. Warwick was the son of Edmund Dudley, who pe rished with Empson on the scaffold soon after the accession of Henry VIII. The son was not deterred from looking to public life by the fate of his father, nor do the sins of his ancestor appear to have been remembered against him. He became soldier and diplomatist, and rose to the dignity of lord high admiral. As lord Lisle, he had command of the English fleet at Spithead in 1545, when England was menaced with invasion by France. He had acquitted himself with ability and courage under Somerset in the battle of Binkie. He had since given further evidence of his military capacity in suppressing the insurrection in Norfolk. He does not seem to have been a man of any settled principle concerning either government or religion. According to his confession in his last moments, he was never in heart a Brotestant, though he never ceased to act prominently with that party after Edward's accession. We know that he lost no opportunity of enriching himself from the spoils of the church. He could, however, after the manner of his father, play the part of the grave moralist, and by the proprieties of his talk, and his great caution, he won much confidence from those with whom he had intercourse. He could even add tears to the gravity * ' Every lord and councillor went through the city weaponed, and had their servants likewise weaponed, attending upon them in new liveries, to the great wondering of many.' \u2014 Holinshed."], [401, "STRUGGLE BETWEEN PAST AND PRESENT. 379 of his discourse, when the occasion was such as might book vii, be served by them. But he was in heart thoroughly CnAF\" '\" selfish, studiously self- governed, and shrewd enough to see the value, not only of seemly words, but of ap pearing, at times, to be capable of a generous action. He was a man of strong ambition. His great object in life was the elevation of himself and his family. He was ready to pursue that object at almost any cost of sincerity or principle. The removal of lord Seymour seems to have been the work of Warwick, much more than of the Brotector. Somerset was a man of another order. It is evident character that he entered upon his office with the feeling, not nLration only of an honest, but of a devout man. He was, ofSomerset however, in some respects, unequal to his position. Compared with his brother, the lord admiral, he was a man of caution and sagacity. Compared with his rival, the earl of Warwick, he was wanting in those endowments. He had carried out the war in Scot- land, which had been conditionally bequeathed to him by the late king He had also followed what was generally regarded as an honourable course in attempt ing to defend Boulogne, then in the hands of the English, against the hostile intentions of France. But the success at Binkie Cleugh had been counterbalanced by disasters on the other side the English Channel; and both enterprises had involved large expenditure, and heavy debt, without any real advantage to set over against such consequences. No special impost had been laid upon the nation to meet this difficulty ; but it was clear that the debt had been incurred, and the forebodings were serious. At the same time, the expense of the royal household had increased; and the profuse habits of the duke himself, pulling down churches to build mansions, provoked considerable observation and censure. The debt, however, which had been contracted under the rule of Somerset, was the great cause of his downfall, though Warwick and his friends were careful to add to that item of accusa-"], [402, "380 PROTESTANTS AND NATIONALISTS.

The duke had really done nothing to encourage in subordination. But his feeling in favour of a suffering people was treason to many of the men about him. Even Sir William Baget, friend as he was supposed to be to the Brotector, had taken up the language of his enemies on these points, and became sarcastic and bitter in his attempts to induce him to cast away such philanthropic fancies. ' I know,' he said, ' your gentle ' heart right well, and that you mean what is good.' But in his judgment, this gentleness was ill-placed \u2014 the insurgents should have been crushed at the first with a strong hand. Nor did the censure of Baget end at this point. Somerset had recently become, and per haps unconsciously to himself, haughty and irritable in his bearing towards the men with whom he acted, and by this manner, even more than by his measures, he had made himself enemies among those who were most capable of serving him as friends. ' Of late,' says Baget, ' your grace is grown in great choleric fashions, ' whenever you are contraried in that which you have ' conceived in your own mind. Unless your grace will ' more quietly show your pleasure, no man will dare ' speak to you what he thinks. In council your grace ' sometimes nips me sharply.'* Men who know any thing of the cares of office, can understand how possible it is that temper should be thus affected by them, especially in the case of a man of a frank and manly dis position, and endowed, not so much with a wise circum spection, as with a consciousness of good intentions. But such were the circumstances which gave the enemies of the Brotector advantage over him. War wick and his adherents, by their secession from the * Strype's Eccles.

Somerset sent forth a procla mation calling upon all faithful subjects to rally armed about the person of the king. The lords in London made their appeal to the citizens, alleging that their intentions were most loyal, and that the person of the king was in danger, not from them, but from the falsehood and treason of the Brotector, and they urged against him all the matters of accusation above men tioned. The duke and the king were at Hampton Court, somerset The chief persons with them were Cranmer, Baget, u\"ia fallen. Sir William Betre, Sir Thomas Smith, and Mr. Cecil. Lord Bussell and Sir William Herbert, who had the 1549. greater part of the army at their disposal, declared that from what they could see of the quarrel, it was more personal than public, and they counselled mode ration, and some new settlement. This decision left the duke powerless. Correspondence ensued between him and the lords ; but it soon became evident, to himself and to others, that he was a fallen minister, and his opponents were not in a mood to deal leniently with him. Cranmer, Baget, and Smith addressed a joint letter to them, which set forth the case of the Brotector with so much ability and pathos, that it was deemed expedient to adopt a more conciliatory tone. But Somerset was not a man to provide against the statecraft of the parties now leagued against him. Two messengers sent by, him to the lords, Sir William Betre and Sir Bhilip Hoby, played him false. In a secret letter to the king, the alleged faults of the duke were exaggerated in the most artful terms, and coming in the wake of so much of the same kind that had been made familiar to him through other chan nels, this communication appears to have effaced the last trace of affection from the mind of the nephew towards the uncle. Cranmer, Baget, and Smith were also secretly warned, that unless they ceased to sup-"], [404, "382 PROTESTANTS AND NATIONALISTS. BOOK VII, Chap. z. Pledge os the lords to the duke.

Cranmer appears to have put himself in the hands of Baget, and Baget not only forsook his master, but gave information to his ene mies as to how they might take him. It was when the duke was known to be thus bereft of friends, that Sir Philip Hoby, in behalf of the lords, delivered him self as follows to Somerset and those about him : \u2014 ' My lord and my lords and masters of the council. ' My lords of the council yonder [in London] have ' perused your letters, and perceived the king's ma ' jesty's requests and yours, aud have willed me to ' declare unto you again that they do marvel much ' why you do so write unto them, as though they ' were the most cruel men in the world, and as though ' they sought nothing but blood and extremity. They ' say of their honours they do mean nothing less ; and ' they bade me declare unto you, from them, that on ' their faiths and honours they do not intend, nor will ' hurt, in any case, the person of my lord the duke, ' nor of none of you all, nor to take away any of his ' lands or goods, whom they do esteem and tender '-as well as any of you, and as one whom they are not ' ignorant, no more than you, that he is the king's ' uncle.

' My lord,' then said he to the duke, ' be ye not ' afraid. I will lose this my neck [and so pointed to ' his neck], if you have any hurt. There is no such ' thing meant, and so they would have me to tell you ; ' and mark you well what I say. Upon this, all the ' aforenamed wept for J03-, and thanked God, and prayed ' for the lords.

' knees, and weeping, said \u2014 Oh, my lord, ye see now book vii. ' what my lords be.'* Chap j' The duke gave credit to these assurances. But what followed ? Fh*st, to his amazement, he was put under arrest. Next, he was conducted, with an escort of some three hundred lords and gentlemen, through the streets of London to the Tower ; and to escape with his life from the charge of ' high crimes and misde ' meanours' brought against him, he was obliged to confess himself guilty, to ask pardon upon his knees, and to submit, not only to the loss of his offices, but to the loss of goods and chattels, and of his personal liberty. So did these men fulfil their pledge that his ' honour,' and his ' lands and goods' should remain un touched ! Sir Thomas Smith, as may be supposed, shared in the loss of liberty and property which had come upon his master. f One of the first measures of the council was to Northum- confer the office of lord admiral on the earl of War- %\u00a3\u00a3\u00a3? wick.

Had he attempted to restore the Nationalism of the last reign, or the Bomanism which had pre ceded, it would have become him to divide his power with leading men in the old families, and in fact to have resigned the government into their hands. But he knew that Edward would be opposed to any such changes. He knew, moreover, that he had risen to power by the hands of men whose estates had grown large by the suppression of the religious houses, and that much of his own wealth had come from that source. These considerations were quite enough to prevent his thinking of a reactionary policy. Above * MS. Harleian, 353, folio 77.

The earl of Southampton, the great hope of the Bomanists, and who had been conspicuous in the escort which lodged Somerset in the Tower, was re moved from court ; and circulars were addressed to the bishops, assuring them that the Beformation in religion would be in no way impeded by the change which had taken place.* Somerset was committed to the Tower in October, and remained a prisoner until the following February. He was then released, under a heavy fine, and in April was admitted to a seat in the council. One of his daughters was given in marriage to the eldest son of his rival. But that bond did not suffice to produce amity between the two families. Somerset came to be in frequent communication with the king, and was supposed to be gaining an influence over him. Warwick watched this course of events with much apprehension. This was the state of affairs some twelve months after the restoration of the duke to a place in the council. Warwick was then created duke of Northumberland ; lord Dorset, the father of lady Jane Grey, became duke of Suffolk ; Baulet, earl of Wiltshire, became marquis of Winchester ; and Sir William Herbert was made earl of Bembroke. Somerset looked with alarm on these proceedings. He was suddenly arrested, together with the duchess, and several of their friends, and sent to the Tower. BOOK VII, Chap. a. i549. Dec. 25.

The enemies of the duke were intent upon justifying their proceedings by making out the strongest possible case against him ; and as they did not affect to have established anything against him beyond the above points, we may safely conclude that the evidence in support of the most weighty charge, the intended assassination, was felt to be of a kind that it would not be expedient to produce. Edward's Journal has been a great authority with improha historians on this subject. But it should be re- the mo\u00ab membered that Edward knew nothing of this affair except as he was told ; and that he was told nothing, .except by persons disposed to make the most unfavour able impression in regard to the duke. Sir William Balmer, the man who charged Somerset with medita ting insurrection and murder, was a person entitled to no sort of credit, and manifestly the tool of Northum berland. He had so overdone his part, that it was deemed prudent to make little use of him, so much so, that the earl of Bembroke, lord Grey, and Baget, who were all implicated in his statements, were not placed on their trial, and were examined only under the strictest secrecy. Six months had now passed since the supposed conspiracy had risen to the formidable height described by Balmer \u2014 and was it possible that an organization so extended, and so perilous to so * Edward's Journal. C C 11"], [408, "386 PROTESTANTS AND NATIONALISTS. BOOK VII. Chap. z. many persons, should have remained a secret so long ? During the intervening months Somerset is one of the most constant attendants in court and council, and his conduct during those months passes unchallenged. We have evidence, indeed, at the close of June, that Northumberland, while regarding Somerset as a political rival, and fully prepared to take advantage of any false step that might be made by him, had nothing to lay to his charge beyond such matters of difference as might be expected to arise between two men who were competitors for the same power. From an entry in Edward's Journal on the last day of August, we learn that Somerset had been employed two days before in putting down a popular conspiracy against the gentlemen, at Oakingham, where he sent some of the offenders to the gallows. Even so late as the fourth of October, only three days before Palmer made his communication to Warwick, lord Arundel, who, according to that communication, was to have been as a right arm to Somerset in his scheme of treason and murder, was released from the Tower by an act of the council ; nor was this alleged accomplice brought to trial when proceedings were instituted against the duke. According to Palmer's evidence, Sir Thomas Arundel was to have become master of the Tower. Sir Balph Vane was to have been ready with two thousand men. Sir Miles Bartridge was to have raised London, and to have secured the great seal. Sir Michael Stanhope, too, had been privy to the whole project. All these men perished on the scaffold, under these charges, but they all died solemnly de nouncing Balmer as a false witness, and affirming that they had not been parties to any treason, or to any plot against the life of Northumberland or of any other person.* In fact, Balmer and Northumberland themselves confessed before their death, that their con- * The confessions of Crane and Arundel in Tytler, ii. 38-45, are such as to render the truth of these assertions highly probable."], [409, "STRUGGLE BETWEEN PAST AND PRESENT. 387 duct towards Somerset had been untruthful and book vii. unjust.* CnAP'*' Chap. z. The truth seems to be, that Somerset's very natural discontent was felt by Northumberland to be incom- the case. patible with his own quiet ; that he earnestly desired some tangible ground for proceeding against him, and for putting him out of the way ; that Palmer was not ignorant of that feeling, and shaped his evidence with a view to it ; that his communication, though found, on consideration, to be so bad, that only a partial use could be made of it, became the ground of real or affected alarm ; that hostile conferences and measures being once resorted to, it was too late to look back ; and that Northumberland and his party were obliged, in the end, to content themselves with so much of proof against the duke, or of the semblance of it, as might serve to free them from all further trouble at his hands. It was assumed that the state could not be at rest while Somerset lived, and state ethies were supposed to require that he should die.f The trial of the duke, like so many proceedings of The trial. the same description, furnished stronger evidence against the justice of the court, than against the inno cence of the person accused.

Benard was a man who could lie to any extent when his policy seemed to require that he should so do ; but Northumberland had sunk so low as to be utterly powerless when the ambassador wrote thus concerning him, and he could have had no motive for attempting to sink him lower. f Sharon Turner, whose facility in accumulating historical material greatly exceeded his power of using it when obtained, confiding in Palmer's testimony and Edward's Journal, has classed Somerset with the Borgias of history. Dr. Lingard has followed much in the same track. Hume, availing himself of the more sober light supplied by Burnet and Carte, has delivered a different judgment. Mr. Froude has not woven this portion of the web of his history with a steady hand, and seems to share himself in the perplexity which his narrative must leave upon his readers. Mr. Tytler's statement of the evidence on the case is the fullest, and, in my j udgment, the most satisfactory in our literature. The narrative in Howell's State Trials is in many respects inaccurate and misleading. c c 2"], [410, "388 PROTESTANTS AND NATIONALISTS.

No witnesses on either side being admissible, the prisoner, as usual, had to depend wholly on him self in dealing with the written evidence produced against him \u2014 evidence always so digested and shaped by the government officials as to ensure that the verdict should be in favour of the prosecu- tion. The language of the young king concerning this trial has been the main source of the impressions unfavourable to the duke which have survived to our time. Edward's account, however, of what took place, is neither consistent nor accurate. In a private letter he states, that after the trial his uncle asked pardon of Northumberland and other lords, ' whom he confessed ' he meant to destroy, although, before he swore 'vehemently to the contrary.' But in his Journal, Edward makes the duke confess something of this sort during the trial, and is silent as to any such admis- sion afterwards.* The fact was, the government had found it necessary to drop the assassination charge, which rested solely on Balmer's worthless testimony, and had restricted their inquiry to circumstances which were construed as evidence of an intention to take possession of the powers of the state by force. This is manifest from the questions prepared to be put to the duke by the government ;f and from the official reports made concerning the ground of the judgment passed upon him.] Had the duke confessed himself a murderer, the English people, and every court' in Europe, would have been sufficiently apprised of the fact. The offence, accordingly, of which the duke was said to have been convicted was not treason, but felony- \u2014 a crime which served the purpose of his enemies equally well, inasmuch as it entailed capital punishment. * Fuller's Church History, iv. 84-85.

Early on the previous day, F0^8',, every householder had been ordered to keep his family Ms favour. at home during the night ; to be prepared with ' a ' man in harness ;' and the city was to be placed under a diligent watch. But these precautions did not pre vent the neighbourhood of Westminster Hall from being crowded with people ; and as the axe borne before persons condemned as traitors was not visible when the duke left the hall, the people rushed to the conclusion* that he had been acquitted, and throwing their hats and garments in the air, they raised shouts which rolled in full peal to Charing Cross, and were heard in the Long-acre, and at Temple-bar. At his execution, too, a false alarm from a neighbouring street occasioned some disturbance ; in the moment of disorder Sir Anthony Brown was seen riding towards the scaffold, and the people seeing in him a messenger of mercy, began to cry ' A pardon ! a pardon !\u2022 \u2014 God save the king.' But again there was disappoint ment. Somerset was condemned at Westminster Hall, and he was to die on Tower-hill. He met his fate with the calm self-possession which became him as a Christian nobleman, and expressed himself as especially thankful for the part he had been permitted to take in the reformation of religion.* The record made by Edward in his Journal concerning these last moments of his uncle is \u2014 ' January 22. The duke of ' Somerset had his head cut off upon Tower-hill, ' between eight and nine o'clock in the morning.' And this is all ! But the mind of the young king had been lone: under bad influences. He had been made to believe his uncle capable of seeking power by playing the rebel and the assassin, and so the last vestige of affection towards him would seem to have passed away. * St w, 597-606.

Protestant persecution \u2014 rise of the noncon- formist con troversy. But the parliament appears to have become uneasy in looking on the flagrant violations of justice and humanity which had become so much a matter of course in our state trials. It was after the death of Somerset, that the law was passed which provided, that in cases of treason there should be the evidence at least of two witnesses, and that the witnesses should be openly examined by the person accused, and in the presence of the persons required to deliver the verdict.* Such were the struggles of the court factions under Edward VI. Northumberland con tinued in power to the end of this reign. Another phase in the history of this reign consists in the persecution of Brotestants by Brotestants, and in the beginnings of those more free opinions in religion which have so often exposed Brotestant nonconformists in our history to hard treatment. According to some persons, the mission of these parties has been to in dulge in a morbid scrupulosity, to breed discontent and feud, to weaken the Protestant faith, and to gender nothing but mischief. According to others, we may see in them a class of men in advance of their times, and who have formed the vanguard in the march of free thought, of free action, and of freedom in every thing. When the Nationalist went his one mile from Bome, it was thought strange that he should punish the Brotestant because disposed to go twain ; and it has been the belief of the English puritan, and of the English nonconformist after him, that the reasoniug which led the Church of England thus far, might, in all consistency, have led her much further, especially when the crisis of change, and of danger from the common enemy, had passed very much away. In these * 5 & 6 Edw. VI. c. 1 1 .

In the study of our history during the sixteenth century, it should be borne in mind, that it never ceased to be the policy of the Bomanist, to accuse the English churchman of giving licence to every sort of religious error and disorder if he failed to curb freedom of thought and of action with a stern resolve ; and, on the other hand, to accuse him of being as much dis posed to persecution as his neighbours if he should be inclined to make such use of his power. There was no escape from this dilemma. It was felt that the one horn or the other of it must be met, and the Anglicans generally decided that there was less to apprehend from being charged with persecution, than from being open to the reproach of indifference about religious order and religious truth. Want of courage had much more to do than is commonly supposed in determining the landmarks of the English church. Hooper, bishop of Gloucester, represented the feeling \u2122*tT^. of many, both among clergy and laity, in taking ex- troversy. ception to the use of the old clerical vestments. It was not wished by these persons that the clergy should cease to use any distinctive costume, but simply that habits which had come from a source so disowned, and with which so many superstitious fancies had been associated, should be displaced by others less liable to abuse. The judgment of the reformed churches, with which Hooper had been in communion while in exile, was generally against the use of such habiliments. But Cranmer and Bidley were possessed with the idea, that in the English church there should not only be a strict unity of faith, but a strict uniformity of worship. Hooper's influence as a bishop, and his ex-"], [414, "392 PROTESTANTS AND NATIONALISTS. BOOK vii. Chap. z. Separate congrega tions formed traordinary efficiency as a preacher, were invaluable at such a juncture. But these good men were prepared to see him decline his bishopric, and abandon the pulpit, rather than allow him to preach in any other than the prescribed dress. His obstinacy, as it was accounted, was seriously punished. He was kept out of his bishopric. He was not allowed to preach. He was put under restraint ; and, at last, strange to say, was sent to prison \u2014 to that convenient seclusion for so many impracticable men in those days, the Fleet. After a while, the dispute was in some way compromised. Hooper consented to wear the obnoxious garments when he preached before the king, but was left to his liberty at other times. His German friends, while fully of his mind about the ' popish garments,' had urged him months since to comjfly with the use of them, rather than suffer himself to be precluded from doing the great work before him as a Christian bishop.* No doubt, the fashion of a garment was a trivial matter, but the argument from triviality may be said to have had two edges. If it was a trifle to resist, it was also a trifle to enforce. To become a separatist for such a reason may be weak, and to necessitate separation for such a reason may be no less weak. But besides the men with puritan tendencies, who, like Hooper, remained in the church, there were others who began to form separate congregations, to choose their own ministers, and to regulate their own affairs. We read of a congregation of this description at Bocking in Essex, and of another at Faversham in Kent. We do not find that these persons differed in anything very material from the Brotestant doctrine of the age, except that in their theology they appear to have been more the disciples of Belagius than of Augustine. The two congregations above mentioned had their joint meetings for worship and for religious action, contributing of their substance to diffuse their * Strype's Eccles. Mem. ii. bk. ii. c. 28. Foxe.

It appears that such congregations were book vii, not confined to Booking and Faversham.* C\"AP '' Many pious people, without ceasing to be good churchmen, assembled on ordinary week-days to listen to their favourite preachers. The disguised enemies of the Beformation in the government were not pleased with this indication of religious life, and the custom was suppressed. f But the zeal of the government in support of its The P^05,e \u00ab ii -i \u2022 . i described us own orthodoxy was especially directed against the Anat>aP people designated in that age as Anabaptists. The persons so described were mostly foreigners, and of the German race. From recent events on the continent, anabaptism had become associated in most minds with maxims opposed to morality, and to the existence of society. Measures taken against it, accordingly, were regarded as measures, not so much against false opinions in religion, as against principles which left no virtue or safety to the state. From all we learn concerning the people of this description in England in the time of Edward VI., they appear to have con sisted of two classes \u2014 moderate men, who objected principally to the baptism of infants as unwarranted and superstitious ; and extreme men, as they were deemed, who rejected the doctrine of the Trinity, and the doctrines commonly allied with it. \\ In 1549, complaints were made to the council Van ra\"8 against the proselyting zeal of these people, and a commission was instituted to search after Anabaptists, heretics, and persons repudiating the Book of Common Brayer, and to reclaim them, or to subject them to the severest ecclesiastical and civil penalties. Some * Strype's Eccles. Mem. ii. 369, 370. Some of these people were summoned before the council \u2014 five were committed to prison, and seven more were bound in recognisances of 40Z. each.

Joan Boclier. tradesmen in London who had become Unitarians were induced to recant. But a Dutchman, named Van Baris, in practice as a surgeon, was not to be thus influenced. He persisted in avowing his obnoxious creed, and was burnt as a heretic. The life of Van Baris had been eminently pure, and his conduct at the stake showed that his faith, whatever it may have been, had raised him above the fear of death.* With the fate of Van Baris we have to place that of Joan Boclier. The female bearing this name, like her martyred friend Anne Ascue, was in frequent commu nication with religious ladies about the court. She had been active in distributing Tyndale' s Testaments, and other religious books. When arrested on the charge of heresy, the only error proved against her, seems to have been a subtle fancy concerning the Incarnation. She maintained that the flesh of the Virgin was necessarily sinful ; that had Christ taken flesh from her, his flesh too must have been sinful ; and that the flesh of the Saviour, accordingly, could not have been so taken. So clear to her mind was the force of this reasoning, that she lost patience with her judges when they professed not to see it as she saw it. Much was done, both publicly and privately, with the hope of bringing the misguided, but conscientious and highmindecl woman, to abandon this opinion, but without effect. Sad to say, even the holding of a notion so little intelligible, and apparently so harm less, was accounted as worthy of death. Joan Bocher has her place among the Smithfield martyrs. Her end demonstrated her integrity, and has brought dishonour on Cranmer, and Bidley, and Latimer, who were all more or less consenting to this subjection of a weak woman, to a doom so dreadful, for an offence so venial. Joan Bocher's error seems to have been a form of re action against the Mariolatry of her time.f * Burnet, iii. 206. f Foxe says that Cranmer was employed by the council to prevail on the reluctant young king to sign the cruel warrant, which he at length"], [417, "395 STRUGGLE BETWEEN PAST AND PRESENT. While recording these facts, so little to the credit of book vii, our infant Protestantism, it should also be recorded, \u00b0]^*- that Joan Bocher was the only British subject who G^jjesa suffered death on religious grounds during the reign of the go of Edward VI. Bomanist blood was not shed, on any under Ed such pretence, through those years. The barbarities ward VI' of the next reign were so far without precedent. When the Marian persecutors sent Brotestants so freely no Ro to death for their religion, they did it knowing full blood shed. well that English Brotestantism had not so dealt with themselves. In a few instances, Bomanists were de prived of their offices, and put under restraint, but that was the extent of their suffering. In no country in which the two religions stood face to face, had there been such toleration and forbearance as in England under its first Protestant sovereign. Unhappily, in those times, no party really under stood the right of private judgment. The Natio nalist did not so understand it as to tolerate the Protestant ; the Protestant did not so understand it did, but did so with tears in his eyes, telling the archbishop that if there was sin in that deed it should lie at his door. Burnet and Strype have taken this story from the hearsay of Foxe, and so it has passed into all our histories. \u2014 Burnet, iii. 207. Strype, Eccles. Mem. ii. 185, 186. The following is from Edward's Journal: ' May 2. Joan Bocher, other wise called Joan of Kent, was burnt for holding that Christ was not incar nate of the Virgin Mary, being condemned the year before, but kept in hope of conversion. And on the 30th of April the bishop of London and the bishop of Ely were to persuade her, but she withstood them, and reviled the preacher that preached at her death.' This is not the record to have been expected from the king, if the scene described by Foxe had really taken place. It is certain also that Cranmer was not at the meeting of the council on the 27th April, 1550, when the following minute of proceedings was recorded : ' A warrant to the lord chancellor to make out a writ to the sheriff of London, for the execution of Joan of Kent, condemned to be burnt for certain detestable opinions of heresy.' The warrant of the sheriff was the writ of the chancellor, according to the statute Be H\u0153retico Combu rendo, signed by the council and not by the king. \u2014 Bruce, Pref. to Hut chinson's Works.

Tast and Present. as to tolerate the puritan and the separatist ; and the puritan and separatist were far from so understand ing it as to see that it became them to tolerate the alleged errors and idolatries of Bomanism. With the Anglo-Catholic and the Anglo-Brotestant, private judg ment meant the judgment of the state. With the puritan and separatist it meant the judgment of their party. The maxim that opinion should be free so long as it does not obtrude itself injuriously or offen sively upon the freedom of others, found little favour in that age ; and the age was far distant in which it was to become a considered and recognised principle of social life. We naturally wish that communities should not be so slow in becoming wise. But to that end Brovidence is wont to send communities, as well as individuals, to the school of experience, and in most cases, the lessons of experience have to be often repeated before they are truly learned. We have seen, then, so far, how change was to follow change, and how the founders of the modern Church of England were to do their work. Henry had hoped to continue Catholic, while separating himself from the centre of Catholic unity, and denouncing many Catholic superstitions. But this was not possible. He lived to see that the church of the magistrate must recede to a much greater extent from the church of the papacy. Next in importance to the severance from Bome, was the clear recognition of the great Bro testant doctrine of justification by faith. The human conscience, if not to be set at rest by the services of a priest, must know how to find rest from itself. To the conscience in this exigency, .the doctrine of justifica tion by faith became the means of deliverance. It enabled the mind of the worshipper to realize spiritual rest through its own acts, in place of depending on the acts of another. Under the influence of this great truth the moral sense of multitudes ceased to be what it had been. Conscience became self-reliant, and in that fact we may see the germ of a moral and spiritual re-"], [419, "397 STRUGGLE BETWEEN PAST AND PRESENT. volution which was to become wide, deep, and lasting, book vii, A thoughtful self-reliance is the first quality in man- CHAr\" *' hood, and becoming thus active in the grave matter of religion, it was to cause a new activity in many ways beside, and to do not a little towards rendering it possible that modern England should rise to be the country it has become. But while impulses of this nature were imparted to state of the mind of the nation by the great religious change s\u00b0 through which it was passing, it must be confessed that the good in this case had to struggle, not only with a mass of old evils, but with the new evils inci dent to such a crisis. Bomanism was suppressed, not eradicated ; and on the breaking up of a soil so long neglected, weeds of the rankest description came forth along with products of a better kind. The ablest preachers of the time speak strongly, and no doubt with some exaggeration, of the disorders and vices which resisted them in all their efforts to improve the morals and the general condition of the people. The scramble for property, it was said, occasioned by the suppression of the religious houses, had given a new intensity to the passion of covetousness, and had generated a new hardness of heart. The new owners of the soil, said Latimer, often become steplords, in place of being landlords. By raising rents unduly they have brought on dearth, and have raised the price of provisions, at the same time that by throw ing arable soil into pasture, and enclosing poor meu's lands, they have increased the number of the un employed and the destitute. A new thirst of gain, said this veteran censor, of gain for its own sake, has come over town and country, drying up all the old sources of charity and munificence. From these causes, the honest yeomanry of this land, the class from which its strength in agriculture and trade, and in church and state, has been so largely drawn, are greatly diminished.

The rich do not help the poor, but can chide them, can tell them they are too well off, and would be the better for a stronger curb ; and so corrupt are our magistrates and judges, that the poor have small chance in any suit against the man who can offer a bribe. So a hatred of gentlemen, and a suspicion of men in power, have come to be the common feeling of the humbler classes of the people. With all these evils abroad, is it any marvel if va grancy meets us at every door, if crime fills every jail? And while adulteries are so open and shameless among people of rank, who can expect anything but vice of the worst description among the people beneath them ? Then, in regard to religion, has not contempt of au thority come into the place of bondage to authority ? The old dread of the priest is gone, but should there not be a decent reverence for the ministers of religion, and for the bearers of the civil sword ? The Bible is no longer a sealed book ; but has it been laid open that religious disputes might be brawled in a church porch, or carried on upon an ale bench ? Batrons are not robbed of their presentations by the pope, but does that warrant them in bestowing livings upon the incompetent and the worthless ?* When court preachers could deliver themselves after this manner, there must have been a good deal existing to warrant some such representation Nor is it wonderful that the case should so have been. Bulpit estimates, however, concerning the state of so ciety are commonly one-sided, rhetorical, and should be taken with large abatement. Nothing is more inci dent to age than to account ' the former days as better ' than these.' It is certain that the state of society which Latimer deplores, was really a state of society which had been born with him. The England of his * Strype's Eccles. Mem. ii. bk. ii. cc. 23, 24.

Chap. z. youth was not so much a reality, as a picture sup plied by the pleasant and partial reminiscences of a genial imagination. His heart, full of kindly memo ries, gave a colouring of its own to the scenes of his boyhood and early life. We might wish that the new distribution of church property had fallen to the hands of unselfish and devout men ; but it was better that the distribution should have been such as it was, than that it should not have been made at all. The con tinuance of such a dominance of ecclesiastical wealth in England, would have been the continuance of an enormous ecclesiastical power in this country second only to that of Spain, and would have been utterly incompatible with those developments of civil and religious liberty which are so distinctive of our his tory. It should be remembered, too, that much which had been kept down by the rigid discipline of the past now came to the surface. Often men were not really more vicious, but only less bound to conceal their vices. The good in society, after all, was much greater, and the evil seemed to be greater than before from the new contrast. Amidst much change which seemed to be for the worse, there was more which was certainly for the better. In a crisis in which all things appeared to be disturbed, it was not surprising that many should show themselves bewildered, and that some should mistake their way. Good men had expected too much from their reformed doctrine, and they did not patiently bear their disappointment. It had not prevented evil, nor had it done good, to the measure of their hope. But the best portion of the mind of the country had received a new life from it which was to last on, and to become a regenerating power, when the evils which had grown up about it, and had been in part occasioned by it, should disap pear and be forgotten.* * The following passage from the pen of Catherine Parr will suffice to show the kind of religious life which the faith of the English church"], [422, "400 PROTESTANTS AND NATIONALISTS. BOOK VII, Chap. z. The notion that the founders of the church of Eng land under Edward VI. moved too rapidly, and that by so doing they prepared the way for the reaction under Mary, is one that will not bear scrutiny. It should be remembered, that the Brotestant Beforma tion moved faster and farther in every country that was to become Brotestant than in our own. We may add, that it would not have been in the power of Somerset and Cranmer to have perpetuated the Na tionalism of the last reign, as left by Flenry, had they been so disposed. Bonner and Gardiner, indeed, would have endeavoured to sustain the rule of the Six Articles, and some of their sympathizers seem to think it hard that they were not allowed to make the experiment. But the amiable effort would have failed, and their own destruction would probably have been involved in it. And if change in the more liberal direction was unavoidable, who was to determine where it should be stayed ? In revolutionary times, stillness is often the impossible. Affairs must move backwards or forwards. It may be said, in disparage ment of our Brotestantism under Edward, that the men who converted England were not the disputers of that reign, but the martyrs who preached their doctrine from the flames in the next. But if the Marian martyrs converted England, who had converted the Marian martyrs ? If there was religious power enough in those men and women to move the mind of a great nation over to the better side, whence came that under Edward VI. could awaken : ' Most benign Lord Jesus ! Grant me thy grace that I may ever desire and will that which is most acceptable unto Thee. Thy will be my will : and my will to follow always thrae.

Did it come from the Nationalism of the last book vii reign ? That NationaUsm was a cold, fleshless, blood- \u00b0HAP\" *\" less Erastianism. In its great substance, it was a mere polity, not a religion, and it could not give what it did not possess. Beligion grew up under it, but did so in defiance of it, rather than by its aid. It was by means of those Brotestant forms of thought which, consciously or unconsciously, had become familiar to the minds of such men as Latimer, Bidley, and Cranmer, that devout spirits in this land were disciplined and trained for the great struggle which was awaiting them. Without an advanced Brotes tantism under Edward VI. we should never have had our high-souled martyrdoms under his misguided suc cessor. Nationalism has no book of martyrs. It too often made martyrs, or stood by as pious men were doomed to that fate. Nothing was farther from its thoughts than to aspire itself towards the heroic in that form. It was, in fact, the secularism of that age. Its great aim was to provide that the interests of this world should be disturbed as little as possible by considerations relating to the next. It was of the earth earthy. Nearly everything that took a bad course under Edward, had been forced into that groove by Henry, or had come even to Henry as a heritage from the past. It was not the religious zeal of Somerset and Cranmer which threw half the kingdom into insurrection. We have seen that the insurrec tionists, for the greater part, cared little about the religious question. Their chief complaints had re spect to social grievances, which had come down from a preceding century, and which had been aggravated, and made less endurable, in many respects, by the measures of the last reign. Any estimate concerning the numbers who had now become Brotestant, or who still remained what their fathers had been, must be largely conjectural. There would be an inert mass, even in such times, ready to acquiesce in all changes. The Nationalists II D D"], [424, "402 PROTESTANTS AND NATIONALISTS.

What the future was to be would de pend on the character of the persons into whose hands the power of the government should most legitimately pass. Barties were no doubt nearly balanced. Under a legitimate Brotestant leadership, the Brotestantism of the reign which had now closed would be per petuated. Under a legitimate Bomanist leadership there would be change. In either event, the Na tionalists would trim their boat to the stream, and would drop off to the winning side."], [425, "BOOK VIII. ROMANISTS AND PROTESTANTS. CHABTEB I. THE RECONCILEMENT. WHEN the reign of Edward VI. had closed, Mary, book the eldest daughter of Henry VIII., was in the chap.'i. thirty-sixth year of her age. While Catherine lived, The Prin. Mary made no secret of her aversion to the religious ces! MaiT change introduced by her father. But on the death of her mother, she sought a reconciliation with the king, and avowed herself content with the Beforma tion as it then stood. It is not probable that she approved, even then, of the separation from Bome. But the Nationalism to which she conformed, left her theological belief as a Catholic wholly undisturbed.* Under Edward VI., however, Brotestantism converted the public mass into a communion service, and made private masses unlawful. This was to proscribe the most sacred service in the ritual of the Bomanist. But in the estimation of the Brotestant, the service of the mass was an act of idolatry, and the church or the state tolerating idolatiy, shared in its guilt, and stood exposed to its penalty, as in the times of the Hebrew commonwealth. * \"' In letters by Mary,' says Camden, ' which I have seen, she not only renounced for ever the Pope's authority in England, but also acknowledged her father to be supreme head of the Church of England under Christ, and her mother's marriage to have been incestuous and unlawful.' \u2014 Camden's Elizabeth, in Kennet, ii. 367.

Though priests and people were obedient, without exception ' from any corner of the kingdom,' Mary was resolute in her determination not to conform to this new policy. Laws made concerning religion while the king was in his minority, and contrary to those made by her father, were to her no laws. This was her language in 1549, and it was reiterated in her reply to communications made to her by the council, and by the king himself, in 155 1. She insisted on liberty of conscience, and; had it been a part of her creed to cede liberty of conscience to others, nothing could have been more just than such a demand. She required her chaplains to obey her personal will, though against the law. She refused to hear Bidley preach.* These incidents were felt to be significant as relating to the history and temper of a lady who, at no distant day, might become queen of England. Thoughtful men regarded them with apprehension, but the people gene rally, who rarely fail to sympathize with rank in mis fortune, looked on with a vague feeling of pity. The attempt of Northumberland to withhold the sceptre from Mary, and to pass it to other hands, was the result of no generous or public motive. He simply wished to see the supreme power in the hands of his own family. Lady Jane Grey was grand-daughter to the Mary Tudor who married Louis XII. of France, and afterwards became duchess of Suffolk, f When it became probable that Edward would soon die, North umberland conceived the project of raising this lady, grandniece to Henry VIII., to the throne, in the place of Mary, his daughter, and with this view he hastened a marriage between lady Jane and his own son, lord Guildford Dudley. Subservient parliaments under Henry VIII. had ceded to that monarch the power to settle the succession to the throne by his * Edward's Journal. Burnet, iii. 317-324.

On the ground of this precedent, it was book alleged that Edward might will the crown in favour ckap.',. of lady Jane, his cousin, to the exclusion of lady Mary, his sister, especially as both Mary and Elizabeth had been declared illegitimate by authority of parliament, and the accession of Mary would probably bring with it a foreign husband, and a change in the established religion. Edward, influenced, we have reason to think, mainly by religious considerations, not only assented to this scheme, but urged the adoption of it with much earnestness, and signed a will in its favour. The council sanctioned this proceeding, swore to sustain it, and endeavoured to persuade themselves that it in volved their common interest, and the interest of the realm.* But the success of the duke was dependent on an appeal to the nation, and that was a quarter in which he not only had no influence, but was ex posed to every sort of disaffection. Northumberland and his instruments were the only Death of persons about the king in his last illness. Edward u*vTin~ died on the seventh of July, late in the evening. The Norsolk policy of the duke was to conceal that event until Mary should be in his possession, and be lodged in the Tower. Message had been sent, inviting her to come to her sick brother without delay. She had advanced as far as Hunsdon in Hertfordshire, when a gentleman hastily sought her presence, and having informed her that her brother had died a few hours before, urged her to avoid the snare which had been laid for her, and to fly instantly to her manor of Keninghal in Norfolk, where friends would be found ready to pro tect her. Mary acted with the pronvptitude demanded by the crisis. She rode northward without halting, except to announce her accession from place to place on the road, and to call upon the gentry and people to arm in her cause. Early in the morning following * Chronicle of Queen Jane, and of Two Years of Queen Mary, 1-4. App. 85-102. Burnet, iii. 419-426."], [428, "406 ROMANISTS AND PROTESTANTS.

But the bird had flown, and was beyond his reach.* This was the first piece of treachery to be attendant on the course to which Northumberland now stood committed, and it was not to be the last. But the duke was himself living a life of falsehood, and he had his reward in finding the atmosphere about an atmo sphere of falsehood. History has hardly another story so sadly beautiful as the story of lady Jane Grey. She was the eldest daughter of the duke of Suffolk, but was not at this time more than seventeen years of age. In common with many Brotestant ladies of those times, her studies had embraced a wide circle of reading and learning. Beside the ordinary knowledge of French and Italian, and the skill in music and needlework that might have been expected from a lady in her rank, she could, when not more than fifteen, both write and speak in the language of Plato, and added to her proficiency in Hebrew, the study of Chaldee and Arabic. Her Latin letters were not only equal in style with those of the great men who were her cor respondents, but the matter of them was so pure, so intelligent, and the spirit which pervaded them was so simple, self-oblivious, and devout, as to present a portraiture of human nature as nearly perfect as may be conceived possible in this imperfect world. The character which the doctrines of the Beformation tended to form, and which they really did form in the experience of multitudes even in those unsettled times, was seen eminently in her saintly nature. Brotestant ism realized in her spiritual life, as in that of Catherine Barr, all that the best elements of the ancient Catholicism were supposed capable of realizing. It * Burnet, iii. 419, 420.

But it was not until it was intimated, on her being called to examine the crown prepared for her, that besides the crown to be worn by herself as queen, there was another to be worn by her husband as king, that this guileless woman began to see how the Dudleys had been using her as a tool to further their own family ambition. Gladly would she have extricated herself from the mesh of treason into which she had been drawn. But that was not possible. Warm disputation came up between her and the Dudleys, in which she fell back on Edward's will. That document, she said, named herself as queen, but did not name a Dudley as to be king. If her husband was to become a sovereign, it should be left to a par liament to raise him to that position. Such was her language, and she was not to be moved from it by the disappointed vanity of the stripling whom she had wedded, nor by the storming of his mother. + All this happened within the first four days after the decease of Ju'y \u00bb-\u00ab\u00ab\u25a0 the late king.

This letter was read aloud to the council, and was answered by another, which denied her title, and promised her protection and favour, only on condition of her submission to the laws.* Great now was the perplexity of the duke. The army had been sworn to be faithful to queen Jane. But from the signs of disturbance in several districts, and from the flocking to the standard which Mary had raised, it was evident that what had been gained by craft, could only be made safe by the sword. And who was to lead the army? Northumberland was the ablest man for that office, and, unhappily for his plans, there was not another to whom it could be entrusted. Yet it was hard to say where his own presence was most needed, in the field or in the capital. He decided to march with the troops into the eastern counties, f But the duke had no friends. Bembroke, Arundel, and Winchester were among the noblemen who had enriched themselves by the Beformation, who feared the consequence of Mary's accession, and in swearing to sustain Northumberland really hoped to see him successful. But, if appearances should become un favourable, they were men to seize on the first con venient moment to declare against him. Five ships of war, which had been sent to the coast of Norfolk by the government, went over to the side of Mary. At Newmarket, the soldiers, before they had come within sight of an enemj^, showed the same signs of mutiny. The council in London shared in the defection. So the duke was obliged to fall back upon Cambridge, and there, as is well known, he became a prisoner in the hands of his enemies, his sworn friend Arundel * Burnet, iii. 420-424. Collect.

This was a great revolution \u2014 how is it to be ex- ThereTom_ plained ? The Bomanist explanation is, that only a Bon and its remnant of the people had become Brotestant, that the nation, in reality, both high and low, had remained soundly Catholics It is elsewhere alleged, that the effect of the Beformation, to this time, had been to throw bad men \u2014 reckless spoliators, to the surface, to send barbarism into the universities, poverty to the homes of the poor, and disorder and suffering almost everywhere. In other quarters we may be told, that religion, after all, is much more an affair of the pocket and of the stomach than is commonly supposed ; that bad times coming along with Brotestantism, led people to conclude that both must be bad; and that thus they became willing to part with their new religious faith, in the hope of being more lightly taxed, and of finding better markets and cheaper food by returning to the old creed. That there is some truth in this pelf and-provender philosophy no man of sense will deny ; but that it gives us a sufficient explanation, or any near approach towards an explanation, of the religious changes in our histoiy from 1547 to 1560, is not to be for a moment admitted. Men who have imbibed the secular and sceptical temper of modern society can never apprehend the real spirit of the times under review. The morals of men were often low, but they all clung to religious faith of some kind, and those who embraced a pure faith, generally did so with a feeling not to be affected by any sliding scale of interest or of prices. It was the middle class and the poor, who especially felt the evil of the times, and those classes were to be the conservators of English Brotestantism. One leading cause of the change which took place uupopu on Mary's accession is found in the character of Northum- Northumberland. The court and the crowd were \u00b0\u00abiand. * Chron. of Jane and Mary, 10. Burnet, iii. 429, 430. t Parsons."], [432, "410 ROMANISTS AND PROTESTANTS. BOOK VIII, Chap. alike aware that the aggrandizement of his house \u2014 a house comparatively of yesterday \u2014 was the one object of his policy. No man loved him, no man placed faith in him. It was not pleasant to a people still much influenced by old feudal feeling, to see an upstart lord take such precedence of the old families. But what was a much graver matter in the mind of the Brotestants, the blood of Somerset, the ' good duke,' was upon this man. At the same time, in the eyes of the suffering peasantry and yeomanry throughout England, this was the man who had done most to crush them to silence, and to prevent a redress of their wrongs. Among the people of Norfolk it was espe cially remembered, that it was this duke who had gibbeted Ket, and had sent death into thousands of families among them, as the effect of that pitiless slaughter which had been perpetrated by his mercena ries at Duffindale. No marvel if the people of Norfolk were more inclined to rally about Mary than to submit to Northumberland. They flattered themselves that they might hope for much from the princess : they could expect no good from the duke. In short, had North umberland been as much believed in as he was dis trusted, and as much beloved as he was hated, he might have had some chance of success \u2014 but only then. Men did not see in him a person for whose sake it would be well to throw a kingdom into a state of civil war. The government of Northumberland, moreover, which was to come so much more lightly on the people than that of Somerset, had proved a burden not easy to be borne. There were scarcely any limits to his personal rapacity ; and when the administration of affairs had been nearly two years in his hands, one of his measures was to issue a proclamation which suddenly reduced the value of every shilling in the hands of the people to sixpence, and of every groat to twopence. The tyranny which Northumberland exercised over the council became proverbial. If there was little in Northumberland to win the"], [433, "THE RECONCILEMENT. 411 popular confidence, it had so happened that there was book the same want of qualities of that description in the c\u2122',, men about him. Since the death of Somerset, no man had become conspicuous who could be relied upon asingof ioy prepared to seek the public interest at any real hazard English*\u2014 to his own.

He had served Somerset, and had assisted to betray him. He had now played the same part towards Northum berland. The disgrace, moreover, which he had in curred by his peculations still clung to him.* The duke of Suffolk, the father of lady Jane Grey, was a weak man of no personal influence. Baulet, marquis of Winchester, was a person whom Knox could describe as ' a crafty fox,' capable of concealing malicious treason under a fair countenance. f Herbert, earl of Bembroke, was formidable from his military experience and his great wealth \u2014 wealth which, as coming largely from the old church, might have been expected to bind him to the new. But he was known to be a man more likely to float with the stream, than to attempt to resist it. The earl of Arundel had lived in confidential commu nication with Somerset after his first disgrace, and had been implicated in the proceedings which cost that nobleman his life. His course towards Northumber land was that of a master in the art of dissimulation. When the duke was about to depart to lead the army against Mary, and was assured by the lords that he might safely confide in them, inasmuch as they were all parties to his proceedings, Northumberland answered, ' I pray God it be so \u2014 let us go to dinner. And so ' they sat down. After dinner the duke went unto the ' queen, where his commission was by that time sealed ' for the lieutenantship of the army ; and then took * Strype's Eccles. Mem. ii. 44. f Admonition to the Professors of the Truth in England, 53."], [434, "412 ROMANISTS AND PROTESTANTS, BOOK VIII. Chap, i ' his leave of her, and so did other lords also. Then, ' as the duke came through the council-chamber, he took 'his leave of the earl of Arundel, who prayed God to ' be with his grace, saying he was sorry it was not his 'chance to go with him and bear him company, in ' whose presence he could find in his heart to spend ' his blood even at his feet. Then the earl of Arundel ' took Thomas Lovel, the duke's boy, by the hand, and ' said \u2014 Farewell gentle Thomas, with all my heart.'* So Macbeth smoothed the head of the son of his victim as he said to Banquo, 'Goes Fleance with you?'f The duke had no sooner moved to a sufficient distance, than Arundel began to say he liked not the air of the Tower, and finding a pretext for going abroad, he at once saw the mayor, and proclaimed Mary as queen. When the duke, foiled and fallen, retired upon Cam bridge, Arundel, now the servant of Mary, entered his chamber. Northumberland threw himself at his feet and implored him to use mercy towards him. ' My ' lord,' quoth the earl, ' ye should have sought for mercy ' sooner ; I must do according to my commandment ;' and so gave him in charge as a prisoner to be lodged in the Tower. J Even Mr. Cecil, now Sir William Cecil, secretary of state, and the future lord Burleigh, does not pass through the ordeal of this crisis without injury. His preferences were no doubt on the side of Brotestantism, and of honest government. But his solicitude to retain official position and influence through the perilous changes which came up about him, exposed him to temptations which he did not always know how to resist. He had been much in the confidence of Somerset, but was careful to stand aside when clouds began to settle on the path of that nobleman. Next he became the great instrument through whom Northumberland exercised his rule. He may have distrusted his master's policy in attempt ing to alter the succession. But two things are certain * Holinshed. f Act iii. scene I. X Holinshed."], [435, "413 THE RECONCILEMENT. \u2014 he was as much committed on that point as his book colleagues, and only surpassed them in the promptitude cJi\"'!. and earnestness with which he endeavoured to pro- ' pitiate the Marian power when he saw that it was likely to become ascendant.* Much excuse may be made for men in such circumstances ; but it is manifest that there was not a man in the court or the govern ment on whom the Brotestants of the nation could lean with any feeling of safety. If the nation cannot save itself from a reaction, there is evidently no leader ship to save it. With this great unpopularity of Northumberland, both as a man and as an administrator, and with this utter absence of such character in the statesmen of the time as might have inspired confidence in the English Brotestants, there was, on the other hand, that deep feeling of loyalty among the people, which foreigners often observed as being one of their great character istics. Whatever changes had come over her pretensions in past times, the final will both of Henry and of the parliament had been, that in such circumstances as had now arisen, Mary should be hailed as queen of Eng land. In the ear of the generation then living, no doc trine had been more often inculcated than that of passive obedience. To resist a lawful sovereign was not only a crime to be punished with horrible severity by the magistrate ; it was a deadly sin \u2014 it doomed body and soul. The homilies to be read in churches had incul cated this doctrine clearly and emphatically. Mary's cruel deeds were to induce suspicion, and, on the part of many, an open rejection of this tenet ; but for the present, its hold upon the conscience, and even upon the conscience of Brotestants in relation to a popish sovereign, was powerful. It was also a consideration of great weight with The attempt these persons, that this attempt to set aside Mary MaTyaiV was an attempt also to set aside Elizabeth. Elizabeth e^^h * Tytler, ii."], [436, "414 ROMANISTS AND PROTESTANTS. BOOK VIII Chap, i Disposition to hope fa vourably concerning Mary. had become the great hope of the English Brotestant. Her influence, it was supposed, would be great even in the event of a Bomanist sister ascending the throne, and everything was expected from her own possible succession. And who was Northumberland, that he should be allowed to suppress such rights, and to ex tinguish such hopes ? It was felt as a calamity that Mary still adhered to the Catholic faith. But excuse, it was thought, might be made for her, and hope cherished concerning her. She had suffered for that creed, and it was natural that she should cling to it. But she was a woman, a virgin princess, and let her see that she had a loyal people about her, prepared to exercise confidence in her sense of religion, of justice, and of humanity, and her sway would surely be found to be benignant. Thoughts of this nature seemed to become only dutiful thoughts, when the queen pledged herself, as she did, to the men of Suffolk and Norfolk, that there should be no alteration in religion.* The reformation under Edward had made greater progress among the manu facturing population of those counties than in most districts. The people in those parts ventured, in a later stage of affairs, to remind the queen, that when her standard was opened among them, the men who had become Brotestants in the time of her brother, were among the earliest and most efficient of her sup porters, on the ground of their faith in her promise that the order of things established by Edward should not be disturbed, f The waste, peculations, and bankruptcy of the government ; the numbers thrown out of employment among the classes willing to labour ; bad harvests and * Foxe, vi. 387. t Strype's Eccles. Mem. Burnet, iii. 442, 443. When Arundel reasoned with the other nobles in favour of going over to Mary, the great difficulty, it appears, was as to what she would do in regard to religion, which he thus met, ' How doth it appear that Mary intends any alteration in religion P Certainly, having been lately petitioned on this point by the Suifolk men, she gave them a very hopeful answer.' \u2014 Godwin's Reign of"], [437, "THE RECONCILEMENT. 415 dear food ; and the excesses of some who pushed their book theories of spiritual liberty into fanaticism, \u2014 all, no chaf?'i. doubt, contributed to prepare many for almost any Distinction change as not likely to be for the worse. But those between aP. were not causes to affect thoughtful men, and had reaTcaus'L there been no other, there would have been no such change as was now taking place. Had Elizabeth been the next in succession, the Brotestantism of the Eng lish people would have been found sufficient to ensure a continuance of the system under Edward. To account that Brotestantism as limited to a feeble minority, is not in accordance with testimony or fact. All that can be said against it is, that it was not found to be a Brotestantism of strength sufficient to ensure a rejection of the legitimate successor to the throne on the ground of her being a Bomanist. What a Bro testant jDeople should do with a popish sovereign, is a question which was to come up in our history more than a century later, and it was found to be a problem not of very easy solution even in that day. If Mary, moreover, was to be received at all, it was fitting that her reception should be genial and confiding. How the generous feeling of the English people, and espe cially of English Brotestants, could be forgotten soon after the summer of 1553 ; and how the instincts of nature in a female sovereign could be dried up or per verted by the action of an apparently exhausted super stition, were matters of the future which no one could foresee, and which few were disposed to account as probable or even possible.* But Mary once recog- Mary, 270.

The government was unwise enough to send Gilbert to the pillory ; whereupon a friend of his, named Pratt, a zealous Protestant, scatters a printed tract about, applauding Gil bert for his loyalty and steadfastness, and expressing delight that the nobles and people were beginning to flock to the standard of Mary, from whose success the writer expects two great results \u2014 an end to the rule of the ' bear,' and a falsification of the prophecy which had said that ' the"], [438, "416 ROMANISTS AND PROTESTANTS. nised, and the power of the state passing into her hands, the dangers of resistance were such as few in our time can imagine. The proclamation of Mary in London took place twelve days after the decease of the king. Great was the rejoicing among the citizens and people. What ever else might be uncertain, the rule of Northumber land \u2014 of the ' bear,' as he was designated \u2014 had come to an end. To lady Jane, the surrender of her transient greatness was an immense relief. Noailles, the French ambassador, with the levity too common among his countrymen, described her as the twelfth-day queen. But no being on earth in that hour was entitled to so much affectionate sympathy as Jane Grey. She was among the prisoners retained in the Tower when her fallen father-in-law was lodged within those walls. When the queen made her entrance into London, Elizabeth met her at Aldgate, attended by a number of ladies, and two hundred horsemen. The sisters embraced each other publicly ; the queen kissed the ladies in Elizabeth's train ; and so the two daughters of Henry VIII. \u2014 the daughters of Catherine and Anne Boleyn \u2014 passed amidst the loud rejoicings of the people to the Tower. But it was observed that the eyes of the populace turned involuntarily towards Elizabeth, who had numbered little more than half the years of Mary, and whose stately form, elegant bearing, and noble countenance, called forth general admiration. The figure of Mary was short and disproportioned. Her features were dark, thin, and careworn. She pos sessed no trace of dignity, except in the action of her keen, dark eyes, and there was a penetrating force in them which was not pleasing. Sir Antonio More has fixed her portrait in colours worthy of Vandyke, though, no doubt, with some shades of flattery. So BOOK VIII. Chap. i. Mary pro claimed in London. July 19.

For the moment, Mary was all clemency, and Northumberland seemed to be the only person against whom the rigour of the law would be allowed to take its course. As her majesty passed the Tower gate, before her, on their knees, were the old duke of Norfolk, lord Courtenay, Stephen Gardiner, and the duchess of Somerset, presenting their homage and welcome. The queen spoke of them as ' her' prisoners, and gave them honourable release. The ringing of bells, the booming of cannon, and the shouts of people on Tower-hill and thronging all the avenues approaching it, were in accordance with such a spectacle. But in that prison house, and hearkening to those notes of rejoicing, were men and women to whose hearts they must have sent a sad and strange influence. Northumberland, his duchess, his three sons, and lady Jane, beside others involved in their enterprise, were all there, and in listening to those sounds were to feel as hearts in such circum stances could alone feel, how the bubbles of this poor life may swell, and burst, and pass away ! But, amidst so many welcome appearances, it is a M\u00ab*y seeks fact, that among all the men so forward to do her 1^\" homage, Mary scarcely knew one whom she could trust. In her silent thought, she had come to the conclusion that she might expect safe counsel from the emperor through his ambassador, more certainly than from any of her subjects. In this fact we have the secret of the dark days which were to follow. The first advice from her Spanish counsellors was, that she should move with caution, especially in religious matters. In the judgment of Charles, and of Renard, his minister, to make light of the Protestant feeling of the country would be madness. But, in dealing with traitors, or with dangerous persons, said the ambassador, pru dence should not degenerate into weakness. Not only Northumberland, said the Spanish minister, but II E E"], [440, "418 ROMANISTS AND PROTESTANTS. BOOK VIII ClIAP. I \"*The new council \u2014 bishops re stored. Trials and execution? lady Jane and her husband, should die, and a jealous watch should be kept over the princess Elizabeth. About that lady the danger of the future would centre; and if she should be caught in any imprudence, no scruple should be felt in putting her out of the way. In the meantime, continued this unscrupulous agent, it will be important that your majesty's council should be selected with as much apparent impartiality as possible. Mary acted on this last suggestion. Bartly from choice, and partly from necessity, her men in office were not all men of one class. But Gardiner, who had been restored to the see of Winchester, became chancellor. The man who now ranked next to Gar diner in influence was lord Baget. Since the payment of the fine imposed upon him for his delinquency he had contrived to retain his footing in public life through all changes.* Such was his power under the new sovereign, that Gardiner, who had patronized him as a youth, attributed the match between Bhilip and Mary to his influence, more than to that of any other man . With the choice of the council came the resettle ment of the bishops. Tonstal, Heath, and Day were all restored to the sees of which they had been de prived. Bonner is said to have left the Marshalseato become bishop of London, in the company of ' divers ' bishops,' and amidst a crowd of people hailing him on his liberation. There were, of course, Bomanists enough in London to supply such a gathering on any such occasion.! Three noblemen, and four gentlemen, were selected to be tried as having been conspicuously engaged in the late treasons. The noblemen were Northumber land, his son the earl of Warwick, and the marquis of Northampton. The gentlemen were Sir Thomas Balmer, Sir Andrew Dudley, Sir John Gates, and Sir * Strype's Eccles.

All avowed, moreover, that they had been out of the true path in the matter of religion the last sixteen years \u2014 that is, since Henry's separation from Bome ; and all received the sacrament after the forms of the old mass. It is probable that they were disposed to this course by the hope of life.* Four were spared. But the duke, Sir John Gates, and Sir Thomas Balmer, were beheaded on Tower-hill. Balmer, it will be remembered, was the perjured witness against the late duke of Somerset. The sons of that nobleman were still in the Tower, were pre sent at the execution, and received, both from Balmer and Northumberland, confession of the wrong which the 'good duke' had suffered at their hands. f As the men in office under Mary were, for the Great ex greater part, the same who had constituted the Fromi'?\"3 government under her brother, any great change for queen the better in the administration of affairs did not seem probable. The people, however, as commonly happens on a new accession, were full of pleasant expectations, though they would have sound some difficulty in assigning any obvious reason for them. Several of Her popular the queen's early measures were good, and contributed \u2122 not a little to sustain the loyal feeling with which she was for awhile regarded. She acknowledged the debts of the late king ; paid the arrears of salary due to a large body of government officials ; took measures * Chronicle of Jane and Mary.

Great was the praise which these proceedings called forth, and great was the expectation raised by them. It has been said, that during the last reign, a puritan simplicity had crept over the manners of the court, and that Mary, recluse as she had been from her youth, restored to it something of its ancient splendour, much to the gratification of the younger members in the families of the nobility.* It would be difficult to name the persons in the court of Edward VI. who would be likely to fall under such in fluences. If there had been any change in that direc tion, it might be attributed, we think, to the tender age and sickly constitution of the king, much more natu rally than to religion. But we doubt the truth of the assertion. The evidence we possess on the subject is opposed to such a conclusion. It is quite true, how ever, that Mary, as queen, dressed superbly, as if to supply the want of more personal attractions by such means, and her coronation was an occasion on which attention to the pomp befitting such occasions became conspicuous. It was observed, moreover, that the bril liancy of that spectacle was thrown about the ancient mass. Gardiner officiated. Cranmer was under arrest. Three months intervened between the accession of the queen and the assembling of her first parliament. In that interval it became evident that Mary was not to be bound by anything that had been done by convo cation or parliament, by crown or council, during the reign of Edward. The bishops who had been de prived of their sees, had all been displaced, with only one exception, on the ground of their nonconformity in respect to matters which had become law. Every authority in the state had ultimately prescribed to * Lingard."], [443, "421 THE RECONCILEMENT. book vm Chap Aug. those prelates the course which was expected from them, and the penalties incurred by them had been incurred as the result of an active or passive resistance to that authority. But the queen now restored these prelates to their sees, ignoring the unrepealed laws by which they had been judged. The uniformity then established may have been wise or unwise, but it was established. So early as the month of August, Mary addressed a letter, solely on her own authority, to bishop Gardiner, as chancellor of the university of Cambridge, requiring that all changes introduced there ' since the death of our father, of worthy memory,' should be done away.* Only a few years since, Gar diner had been zealous in urging constitutional pleas against such acts of the crown, but the time had come in which his promotion, and the objects of his policy, might be served by forgetting all niceties of that description, and they were accordingly forgotten. It may have been a very illiberal proceeding to pro nounce the mass idolatrous, and to make it unlawful. But that had been done \u2014 done by convocation law and by statute law. Mary, however, not only insisted on the service of the mass as a part of her own worship in all places, but at the funeral of her brother, while Cranmer conducted the ceremony in West minster Abbey according to the king's own service book, Gardiner, at the command of her majesty, sung the mass for the dead in the Tower chapel, in the pre sence of some four hundred persons, attracted to the forbidden rite by her example. Such a proceeding, taking place while the royalty of the queen was scarcely a month old, had its influence of course else- where. In many obscure country churches the mass was quietly restored. But in populous districts, it was felt that the innovation would be dangerous. In some instances the attempt was resisted by open riot. But enough had been done to make it no secret in court * Ellis's Lett. 2nd Series, ii. 244-246."], [444, "422 ROMANISTS AND PROTESTANTS. BOOK VIII. Chap, i Persecution of Eliza- beth, or country, that the way to the queen's favour was to be of the queen's religion. During the service at the Tower, the conduct of Gardiner called forth murmurs, and muttered curses, even from the guards in attendance on the queen. It was observed, too, that among the many unexpected faces present on that day, the princess Elizabeth was not to be seen. She had been requested to attend, and had refused, and the gossip of the court made this fact notorious. From this time, the course of persecution to which Elizabeth became subject from the hands of her sister, was such, that anything of that nature which Mary had herself suffered had been a light matter in comparison with it. During the month of August, all that could be done by persuasion or by threatening to induce the sister of the queen to attend mass, was done. Mary appealed to the council on her case, and required the lords to expostulate with her one by one. Elizabeth, still a girl not twenty years of age, answered the arguments to which she was obliged to listen, and did so at length with some curtness and impatience. Her decision, the natural result of her Brotestant education, and of her being the child of an injured Brotestant mother, was described as obstinacy, and it was insinuated that it would no doubt be found to have its root in connexion with some treasonable influences. Elizabeth was a heretic, and the hope of heretics. In prospect of a meeting of parliament, Avhen so much was expected to be done towards re storing the old worship, it was felt to be of the greatest importance that Elizabeth should be paraded as among the reactionists. The measure of this desire was the measure of the anger called forth by her resistance. On one day the talk was, that she would be declared illegitimate ; on another, that she would be imprisoned ; on another, her household was to be removed, and she was to be placed under the watch of strangers. It was with danger thus thickening about her, and menacing her most seriously, that she sought an inter-"], [445, "423 THE RECONCILEMENT. BOOK VIII Chap, i Duplicity of .Mary in ro ffard to her religious po licy. view with Mary. The two sisters met, we are told, in a gallery, with a half door between them, and each with one lady in attendance. The daughter of Anne Boleyn threw herself at the feet of the daughter of Catherine, lamenting that the affection of her sister should have fallen so much away from her, reminding her that she had been educated in the reformed faith and knew no other, but adding, that she was open to instruction, and was willing to read books, or to con verse with learned men, on the points of difference be tween them. Mary was not a young girl. She saw at once that such a process would involve time, and that time was precious. Come to the mass at once, she said \u2014 to the next, which will be in honour of the Virgin, and faith will follow. Elizabeth, we may suppose, had little faith in this promise. But she consented to be present. On that day she bowed herself in the house of Bimmon \u2014 did it, said the French ambassador, from ' force :' did it, said the Spanish minister, with a ' bad ' grace.' Nor could she be induced to repeat the service on the following Sunday. Zealous Protestants may lament this instance of weakness, and still more the measure in which Elizabeth conformed, at a later period, to the worship prescribed by the law. But the feeling of Elizabeth in this matter was a feeling to be honoured, if compared with the heartlessness of histo rians, who, seeing nothing to censure in the tyranny exercised by the one sister, have only sneers to bestow on the submission extorted from the other.* While busy in perpetrating these infractions of law, and in developing this harsh and arbitrary temper, Mary was committing herself more deeply every day to a process of double dealing towards her subjects. One day she could assure her people that they would be left to their religious preferences, without any * Dr. Lingard's account of these proceedings is anything but accurate as to its statements, and is only too characteristic in its spirit. \u2014 vii. 1 84, 185."], [446, "424 ROMANISTS AND PROTESTANTS. BOOK VIII, Chap. Disturbance at St. Paul's Cross. August 1 3 interference on the part of the government ; and the next she could send her secret communications to Bome, in the hope of bringing back the old worship, and all the old tyranny. Her declaration to the Suffolk men in July, was reiterated in an address to the mayor and recorder of London on the twelfth of August. Ten members of the government describe her majesty as saying on that occasion, 'Albeit her ' grace's conscience is stayed in matters of religion, ' yet she meaneth graciously not to compel or constrain ' other men's consciences, any more than God shall, as ' she trusteth, put into their hearts a persuasion of the ' truth that she is in, through the opening of the word ' unto them by godly, virtuous, and learned preach \u25a0' ers.'* Next day, however, Dr. Bourn, chaplain to her majesty, preached by appointment at St. Baul's Cross. The lord-mayor and lord Courtenay were among the persons present. The preacher, intending to please those who had deputed him to his office, began to censure, in strong terms, what had been done in regard to religion under the late king. The people murmured, and at length broke out into such riotous opposition, that a dagger was thrown at the preacher, which fastened itself in the wood of the pulpit, and the offender was indebted for his escape to Bradford and Bogers, two men who were afterwards to suffer as martyrs. So manifest did it become, that the people who had greeted the queen so cordially not many days before, were far from expecting to see the church of Edward VI. displaced by another \u2014 not even by that of the Nationalists, still less by that of the Bomanists. But this event, and a similar scene where an incumbent had attempted to read the old mass, furnished the queen with a plausible excuse for imposing silence on all preachers, except such as should receive her own special licence. And now, a week only after declaring that her subjects were not to be compelled in * Haynes's State Papers, 168."], [447, "425 THE RECONCILEMENT. respect to anything religious, the proclamation is, ' that book ' nothing is to be done in that matter until such time as chap. i.

This ecclesiastic, who afterwards became a cardinal, sought and obtained a secret interview with the queen. Mary satisfied both the envoy and his master that her intention to restore the old worship might be relied upon. But she was careful to enjoin the strictest caution against making any communication of that nature in Bome or elsewhere as from herself. When Commendone Rejoicing m made his report to the consistory, great was the pokbe\" rejoicing.

Three rellgioa' things had become manifest from his visit to England \u2014 first, that the men who had enriched themselves by the spoils of the church were still the men forming the government, and would be strongly opposed, from their selfish interest, to the desired change ; second, that the queen had become ' possessed of her throne ' by the favour of those ivho for the most part hated the ' holy see to the death ; and, thirdly, that there was a sister of the queen, a schismatic aud a heretic, who had once been preferred to Mary by her father, and who was 'in the heart and mouth of every one.' % * Strype's Eccles.

BOOK VIII Chap, Meeting of Parliament, The pontiff entreated Bole to be very mindful of these facts, lest by an imprudent precipitation all should be lost. Mary not only knew these facts, and shared in this caution, but complained of the wise men of the consistory as not having been sufficiently mindful of them. * Bole wrote to the queen earnestly and largely. He was told, however, very firmly, that for the pre sent he must not think of making his appearance in England. So far had these communications been carried \u2014 carried with the utmost secrecy' \u2014 before the meeting of Mary's first parliament, f Great was the misgiving, both in the court of Eng land and in some other courts, in regard to the pro bable complexion of this parliament. Under Henry, the interference and dictation of the government at elections had often been of the most open and impe rative description. The intimidation of electors, when any great point was at issue, went side by side with the intimidation of juries. The reign of Edward had been in this respect, as in so many beside, widely different from the past. Charles cautioned Mary against allowing the influence of her ministers to be very perceptible in the elections of 1553. The em peror suspected that more might be lost than gained by such a policy. But the government feared to leave matters wholly to their natural course. Influ ence, threatenings, and even violence, are said to have determined the elections in many places. When the time came in which men could speak freely, there were those who questioned the validity of this parlia ment on that ground. J The results of the elections were favourable to the * Strype's Cranmer, App. 92.1 et seq. t The writer of the life of Commendone says that, at this time, the heretics were still proud of the authority they had exercised under the former reign, and decidedly hostile to the re-establishment of the Catholic faith.

But it was observed that Mary had not found sion. it practicable to discard the title of supreme head of the church. The number of members returned to the commons was very large, being more than four hun dred. The first session ended in three days. Its business was private and unimportant, if we except an act confirming a statute of the late reign regarding treasons and felonies. The confirmation of this sta tute was no act of grace. The sole purpose of re enacting it was, to append a clause to it, which ex cluded all persons then in prison, that is, all persons concerned in Northumberland's rebellion, from the benefit of some humane provisions included in it. But in Uttle more than a month from its first meet- Measures ot ing, this parliament had dealt with all the great ques tions of the hour, and for the present had settled them. It was made clear that this reaction was not to include the expected restoration of church lands to their former owners ; that nothing was to be said about reconciliation with Bome ; and that the com mons were strongly opposed to the queen's choosing a foreigner for a husband. These were all points of resistance to the known inclinations of the sovereign, and it was ielt to be necessary that some material concessions should be set over against them. About a third of the house of commons would seem to have been Brotestants.* The Bomanist party was incon siderable. The Nationalist temporizers were masters of the position. It was carried, accordingly, and appa rently by a large majority, that the ecclesiastical legis lation under Edward should be wholly rescinded, and that the law in such matters should be the law as left by Henry VIII. No penalty is mentioned as to be incurred by non-attendance on the restored services, * Noailles, ii. 247."], [450, "428 ROMANISTS AND PROTESTANTS. BOOK VIII. Chap, Character of this par liament. but it was sufficiently understood that the old severi ties would be inflicted or suspended according to cir cumstances.* This was all the moderation that could be imposed by the Brotestant, and all the advance that could be made by the Bomanist. To have ceded less, it was thought, would have been to become intolerable to the queen ; to have ceded more, would have been to hazard resistance from the peoples We do not see much to commend in the conduct of the men who ruled in these proceedings. It is the conduct to have been expected from shrewd and worldly men in such circumstances. They exhibit the expediency of the hour, its principle lies with the sincere Bomanist on the one hand, or with the sincere Brotestant on the other. These extreme men, as they are deemed, are the earnest men, and the future is between them. In the preamble to a re-enactment of Edward's milder law concerning treason and felony, these now moderate men indulge in a bitter censure on the Draco legislation under Henry, expecting it to be forgotten that they had most of them been parties to that legislation. | So, when the divorce between Henry and Catherine was to be annulled, Gardiner, among the rest, denounced that divorce as a foul and impious proceeding in all its stages, and attributed it mainly to Cranmer, apparently forgetful of the fact that he had himself striven in that cause to the ut most long before Cranmer's name was connected with it.\u00a7 But affairs cannot long remain in their present * Nine statutes were repealed by this one enactment. \u2014 Statutes at Large, Anno Primo Mari\u00e6, Sessio Secunda, c.

It was another wrong in the section\" train of many that had gone before. The insurrec tion under Wyatt, which was now about to take place, contributed still more to give unity to her adherents, and the semblance of justice to the severities in which she was disposed to indulge. Mary was decided in her purpose to marry Philip, the son of Charles V. But all classes of her subjects were opposed to that match. The general impression was, that by such a step, this country would be reduced to the condition of another Flanders. Everything English would be overlaid by something Spanish. National character would be made to die out. Parliament was dissolved on the ninth of December, and by that time it was well known, that Mary had not only determined on her marriage, but had become intent on shutting Elizabeth out, at all hazards, from her claim to the throne. Distrust, disaffection, and much treasonable talk, in the court and among the people, were the result of this course of affairs. Mary must be made aware, said the malcontents, that she is not to reign as the wife of a foreigner. If she cannot be brought to reason, then Elizabeth must be queen, and must marry an Englishman. Renard did not know all that was taking place. But he knew enough to feel alarmed. He cautioned Mary to abstain from her harsh conduct towards her sister. On state occasions, Elizabeth had been recently placed below the duchess of Suffolk, and the lady Lenox. It was thus inti mated, that in the view of the queen, those ladies stood nearer to the throne than the daughter of Anne Boleyn. To escape from treatment of this nature, Elizabeth prayed that she might be allowed to with draw from court to her retreat in the country. Mary consented, was prevailed upon by Benard to affect a"], [452, "430 ROMANISTS AND PROTESTANTS. book VIII. Chap. i.

When Elizabeth left London, five hundred gentlemen attended her as a self-appointed escort. Care had been taken, how ever, that the home of the obnoxious princess should be watched, and that there should be spies even among her servants. To have detected her as a party in any disloyal proceeding, would have been one of the happiest of events to Mary and her partisans. The council, it was said, had declared themselves against this hated marriage ; the parliament, lords and commons, had declared themselves against it ; and the people, with all the articulation possible to them, had spoken to the same effect \u2014 and all in vain. With the queen, public opinion or feeling weighed as nothing, and there was nothing left but force. It was not until the opening of 1554 that the insurrec tion headed by the man who thus spoke broke out. The leaders were men influenced mainly by English feeling as opposed to Spanish influence, but their fol lowers were mostly men who had embraced the re formed faith, and who looked much farther. The chiefs divided themselves into four sections, and were to act on four different districts, moving simultane ously from those points on the metropolis. Sir James Croft, formerly deputy for Ireland, was to raise forces in Worcestershire and Gloucestershire. The duke of Suffolk, and the three Greys, his brothers, were to move the midland counties. Courtenay, whose name would be potent in Devonshire and Cornwall, was ex pected to act with Sir Beter Carew and others, in those parts. Wyatt was to raise the men of Kent. The action in the west failed through the cowardice and treachery of Courtenay. Want of ability, or of favourable circumstances, attended Croft and Suffolk. Wyatt alone made himself formidable.

The trained bands sent against him under book Norfolk had gone over to him. The few nobles and call^'i. gentlemen who remained faithful to the queen were as little in favour of this Spanish husband as the rioters themselves, and were in consequence divided, irresolute, and inactive. But when matters were at their worst, Mary pre- Mary ad sented herself to the citizens in Guildhall, assured citizens at them that she had no wish to marry if it should not GuildhalL be thought for the good of the nation, and that she would willingly leave that whole question to the wisdom of parliament, if her loyal subjects would only arm in opposition to the lawless men who had drawn the sword both against them and against their queen.* Nothing was farther from Mary's thoughts than any Her false such surrender of her marriage project ; but this pro- flv^her mise, thus solemnly made, saved her crown. crown. In the name of the queen more than twenty thousand armed men were brought together in the metropolis the next day. Wyatt was not allowed to pass London Bridge. His approach to the city by way of Kingston, so weakened the force at his disposal, that from 15,000 men it was reduced to less than a seventh of that number. In a straggling fight, which extended from Hyde-park-corner and Westminster, to Lud-gate and New-gate, his followers were so scattered and cut off from each other, that he stood at length almost alone, and was made prisoner, f It was observed that the greater part of the armed citizens looked on, and would not use their weapons against Wyatt or his men.

She could now send terror to the heart of the discontented, and remove obnoxious persons, under a plea of prudence, necessity, and justice, and what she could do under such pretences she did. Within a few days, Wyatt's men were sent by scores to the gallows, many protesting with their last breath that they were murdered men, having surrendered under a promise of pardon. In all the great thoroughfares and cross- ways of the metropolis, bodies were seen suspended in the air, and left there to tell their tale to the living crowd as they passed. Similar exhibitions were made in the towns of Kent.* That no mercy should be shown to the duke of Suffolk was to have been ex- pected ; but lady Jane Grey, who had been spared on the ground of a treason to which she had been com- mitted, was now sent to the scaffold in revenge of a treason with which she had not the shadow of a con- nexion. She submitted with the self-possession of a sage, and with the piety of a saint \u2014 bowed her young and beautiful head upon the block, and thus passed to the world, unlike the present, awaiting such natures ! Her husband, who was equally guiltless, shared the same doom. If some who might have been expected to follow were allowed a respite, it was from no feeling of clemency. It was in the hope, that by subtlety or by force, matters might be extorted from them that should implicate Elizabeth.

This man was the evil genius of the hour. The dispatch of lady Jane and the Greys was, in his estimation, a most happy proceeding. The free hanging of the rebels, who, as he affirmed, were heretics to a man, was simply a wholesome piece of discipline. But the crowning achievement was to come. Elizabeth must cause no more trouble. f Mary knew what her treatment of Elizabeth had conduct of been, and might well suspect her of looking with some wards \u00b0 sympathy on a movement designed to impose a check EUzabeth on the power from which she had suffered so much, and might expect to suffer still more. Wyatt was a man whose feeling was sufficiently on the side of the national sentiment, and of natural right, to be prompted to some daring in defence of a cause which he believed to be just. But his nature was not of that high and firm cast which ensures consistency. He confessed as much as was desired against the French ambassador and against Courtenay. The former had been aware of what was doing, and the latter had done enough to place his liberty, if not his life, at the queen's mercy. Concerning Elizabeth he spoke obscurely. On his trial he seemed to confess having written two letters to her, one before the out break, advising her to keep at a distance from London, another after the train-bands had gone over to him at Bochester, informing her of his success. But both, it seems, were intercepted by the government.

In ad dition to these circumstances, a copy of the letter from Elizabeth to the queen, written 'now late in her ' excuse,' from Ashridge, had been seized in a packet on its way to Baris, from Noailles, the French ambassador. But Noailles swore that his possession of that docu ment had not resulted from any communication with Elizabeth, nor from any fault on her part.* Elizabeth was also charged with having fortified her house, and with arming some of her servants. But it was not possible to construe these circumstances as affording any proof that she had been a party to Wyatt 's move ments, or even privy to them. It is important also to remember, that after months of severe scrutiny, the evidence against her never went beyond these points. Wyatt, when on the scaffold, declared that Elizabeth knew nothing of the rising before it began ; and though he is reported to have said the same of Courtenay, which could hardly have been true, his language at that moment, the purely presumptive nature of the evidence in all its parts, and Elizabeth's solemn and repeated assertions of her innocence, seem clearly to require that the verdict pronounced in her case should be not guilty. The mind of Wyatt sank into so abject a state while he was in the Tower, that if he could have purchased life by accusing Elizabeth, it is hardly to be doubted that he would so have done. But had the evidence against Elizabeth been of the most deci sive kind, we should not have felt bound to pronounce a harsh judgment upon her. Mary had shown, clearly enough, that she intended, if possible, to rob her sister of her right to the throne ; and had Elizabeth proved to have been a zealous partisan in Wyatt's scheme, it would only have been Elizabeth conspiring against Mary, after conspiracy had led to overt act on the part of Mary against Elizabeth. f * Benard to Charles V.

Elizabeth could not fail to see the drift of the affectionate tone assumed in this epistle.* But she was ill, and petitioned for delay, As the circum stances mentioned became known, Mary was disposed to look on this plea of sickness as feigned, and seems to have fully expected that Elizabeth would be found to have taken part with the traitors. She now sent Feb. !0. Sir Edward Hastings, Sir Thomas Cornwallis, and two physicians to Ashridge, to ascertain the state of her health, and, if possible, to bring her to London. The princess was really ill. She assured the deputa tion that she regarded a removal to London, a dis tance of more than thirty miles, as likely to endanger her life. But the queen's physicians knew the wishes of their mistress.- They interpreted the case as favourably as possible, and at length prevailed on the invalid to undertake the journey by travelling in a litter, and at a rate of not more than six or seven miles a day. Her attendants, when she reached London, included a hundred men dressed in scarlet, and her route was across Smithfield, and through Fleet-street, to Westminster.! Benard describes her approach to the palace. ' The lady Elizabeth arrived here yester ' day, clad completely in white, surrounded by a great ' assemblage of the servants of the queen, besides her ' own people.

It was decided, however, that Elizabeth must not be allowed to be at large. Gardiner suggested that she should be sent to the Tower. Some of the lords expressed themselves as strongly opposed to any such proceeding. But who, it was inquired, is to have the princess in charge? All shrunk from that responsibility. It was in consequence agreed that the advice of the chancellor, exceptionable as it seemed, should be acted upon. Elizabeth must ascend those steps of that great state prison which had become so memorable in the history of her mother. The information was to her feelings little less than a death-warrant.

Mary, in place of being moved to MardTi7. compassion or considerateness by this letter, became deeply incensed against the members of the, council who had permitted this delay, ' and told them plainly ' that they were not travelling on the right path ; that ' they dared not have done such a thing in her father's ' lifetime, and she wished he were alive again, were it 'but for a month.'* sources of In these words we have the real feeling of Mary seeiing\u00b0ng towards Elizabeth, and her settled conviction in regard to the temper in which it became her to exercise her sovereignty. Elizabeth had so much the advantage of the queen in her youth and beauty, and in the spontaneous popularity which followed her, that the jealousy of Mary, if not to be justified, is not difficult to understand. The daughter of Anne Boleyn came between her and the affection of her people ; between her and the event on which her heart was so intently fixed \u2014 her marriage with Bhilip. So long as Elizabeth lived, it was pretended, England could be no safe place to his highness. Mary's happiness, both as a queen and a woman, was thus considerably marred by the presence of her sister. She probably suspected Eliza- beth of having been more or less guilty in regard to Wyatt's proceedings. She would certainly have welcomed sufficient evidence on that point ; and would, after the Tudor manner, have sent her father's daughter to the scaffold without a sigh, or a reluctant thought. Divisions in But the power of the queen in relation to the \u2014 theires1 PrrncesS' an& to some other obnoxious persons, did not sect on the keep pace with her inclination. In this early portion of her brief reign her council was much divided. Gardiner, who sustained the high office of chancellor, had his party. But the party which included Arundel, * Benard to Charles V. March 22nd, MSS. Rolls Office."], [461, "439 THE RECONCILEMENT. Bembroke, and Sussex, from among the nobility, and book Baget, Betre, Cornwallis, and the admiral, lord William chI\" \\ Howard, from among the commoners, was the most \"\" formidable. The men of this last party, though ac commodating themselves very freely to the times, were described by their opponents as heretics, and as the patrons of heretics. More than once the plottings of these factions against each other, seemed to threaten a renewal of the scenes which had taken place in the history of Somerset and Northumberland during the last reign. The liberal party proved itself powerful enough to stay the hand of the queen in the career of blood to which she was stimulated against the followers of Wyatt.* The lord admiral, moreover, was related to Elizabeth, and the strength of the kingdom was at his command. It was feared, and not without reason, that in the event of any harsh proceeding towards the princess, the queen might find the army and navy turned against her. At one time, Gar- diner himself seems to have been .disposed to spare g,?thbof. Elizabeth, though mainly from his regard for Courtenay, and Mary and Benard began to complain of him as impeding their plans. But that mood was of short continuance. In less than two months after the in- f^ 3 surrection, we find Benard urging on Mary, ' that it ' was of the utmost consequence that the trials and ' executions of the criminals, especially of Courtenay ' and the lady Elizabeth, should be concluded before ' the arrival' of Philip. To this the queen replied, ' that she had neither rest nor sleep from the anxiety ' she felt for the security of his highness at his coming ;' and Gardiner then added, that ' while Elizabeth lived ' there could be no tranquillity, and that things would ' go better if everybody went as soundly to work in ' providing remedies as he did.'f If Elizabeth was saved, accordingly, it was not from any friendly feeling * Benard to Charles V.

The mar riage. towards her on the part of Mary, or of the Catholic faction in the government. When it was felt to be necessary to remove her from her confinement in the Tower, Gardiner advised that she should be sent to safe keeping in Pomfret castle ; and had that course been taken, it is only too probable that another royal murder would have been associated with those old walls.* Elizabeth's removal was not to Bomfret, but to Woodstock. But, so long as Mary lived, she never ceased to be under strict oversight and restraint. Gardiner, having failed to secure any available evidence against Elizabeth, would have had her ex cluded from the succession by a bill for that purpose ; and sought an outlet for his restless discontent in attempts to restore the clergy to the possession of those dangerous powers of which they had been de prived by the Beformation Barliament, and to place the machinery of an inquisition at their disposal after the model of Spain. But the lay lords, and especially lord Howard, were opposed to his policy ; and every thing likely to cause disturbance was made to give way for the present, that so Bhilip might no longer hesitate to commit himself to his intended visit and marriage. For these delays and troubles were making sad inroads on the health and spirits of the queen ; and as the council had at length withdrawn its opposition to this ill-starred union, it was resolved that the requisite measures should be taken to ensure that the reception of his highness should be as peaceful and satisfactory as possible.

J\u2122', More than twelve months passed away after the : accession of Mary, and after those rejoicings in Bome therecon- which issued in the nomination of Bole as the person cUement- to go as legate to England, and the cardinal was still, as he had been for many long years, a shadow passing from place to place in foreign lands, or hovering near our shores without daring to place a foot upon them. Both Charles and Benard distrusted the judgment of this zealous Bomanist. They felt that the ardour with which he prosecuted his priestly policy might bring ruin on their political schemes. England, in their view, was a country very difficult to deal with. Only by a very wise admixture of severity and mo- deration could the schism which had taken place be healed, and the great interests involved in that event be secured, and Bole, in their estimation, was not likely to be guided by such wisdom. He had spared no labour, and had incurred all hazard, except the personal, in his endeavours to counteract the tendencies Towards reform in this country. But all his projects had been failures. More than once he had fanned discontent into open insurrection, and the blood of his nearest kindred had been shed upon the scaffold mainly through his influence. But his machinations had tended to consolidate, rather than to demolish, the power against which they were directed.

So Brotestantism was made to give place to Nationalism, and Nationalism, in its turn, to Bomanism. Not only was the see of Bome accepted in all the pre tensions formerly recognised as pertaining to it, but the jurisdiction of the national clergy was re-established, with its old plenitude of inquisitorial power. Bole himself might well grow jubilant as he became the witness of a revolution apparently so thorough and complete. No man's civil possessions were to be in vaded under purely ecclesiastical pretences, but in all other respects the days of Wolsey were to return.

' King Philip and queen Mary rode through the city attended with the cardinal legate, and bishop Gardiner, lord chancellor.

Nor did they put off their caps nor make courtesy to the cross, neither was there scarce any expression of joy at the sight of the king and queen, none saying, God save them.

Had there book not been something better, nobler, in the heart of c\u2122',. Englishmen, than was to be found in the heart of these 'judicious' politicians, England would not have fur nished a single martyr under Mary, might never have become Brotestant, never have become the England of to-day. Such men do not make revolutions. They are always a drag upon them, sometimes attempering such movements not unwisely, but often bringing bad influences to bear against them. It is probable, indeed, that had the Nationalists in what the parliament determined to resist the wishes of the aiiatTmight queen, the result would have been a civil war, dividing something like one half the kingdom against the other h^e QOne half. For in that case Mary would have made large promises, and would have gained many friends. It no doubt became statesmen to pause before committing themselves to such a struggle. We cannot blame men for consenting to make many sacrifices in the hope of precluding it. But the men of this third parliament in the reign of Mary, knew full well the use which the clergy had made of the power now re stored to them, while it was in their hands. They knew also what the temper of the Bomanist party had been during the reign of the Six Acts. They knew, moreover, the contrast presented in this respect by the reign of Edward, with all its faults, to that of his father ; and they had seen enough in the feeling and measures of Gardiner and Bonner, since the queen's accession, to make it highly probable, that the things which it would be in the heart of these prelates to do, would be the things which history has recorded against them. In the spring of this year, they had seen what Gardiner was prepared to brave, if he might only suc- ceed in bringing Elizabeth to the block ; and in the autumn, not three months since, Bonner had covered the diocese of London with spies, who were to report to him all that might be known concerning the history of each clergyman, his character, and the smallest"], [468, "446 ROMANISTS AND PROTESTANTS. book things relating to his habits, so that if leaning in the cJa1\"'*. slightest degree toward heresy, the fact might be known.* This proceeding caused great heat in the metropolis. The liberal men in the government, who rebuked the impatient zeal of this prelate, and who had stayed the hand of Mary herself when shed- ding the blood of the Wyatt insurgents so freely, might have said to the bishops, we cede to you power to act in accordance with your own ecclesiastical preferences, but we do not mean that your authority shall be ex- ercised cruelly, unjustly, or vexatiously. In saying only thus much, they would have taken ground which it would not have been impossible to keep, and which would have entitled themselves to the esteem and gratitude of the living and the unborn. But their course was a timid, narrow, and selfish course. Their own secularities were supposed to be safe, and how it might be with secularities, or life itself, elsewhere, does not seem to have greatly troubled them. Nothing in Nor are we prepared to admit that the conduct of o/thePro0- the Brotestants had been such as to warrant their justifythe being passed over as they were into the hands of their course persecutors. The last reigrn had been characterized by taken to- \u2022 \u2022 *\u00bb wards them, an amount of religious forbearance and toleration such as Christendom had not witnessed for a thousand years. Mary owed her crown to the generous confi dence of her Brotestant subjects. The queen knew this, and her most active supporters knew it. If the follow ers of Wyatt, were known to be Brotestants, the avowed object of their enterprise was rather national than religious ; and that movement did not take place until the pledge which Mary had given, once and again, concerning freedom in religious matters, had been for feited, and the scheme of the court was seen to embrace, not only the Spanish marriage, but the suppression of the Brotestant faith and worship. The wonder is, not that there were such signs of discontent, * Strype's Eccles. Mem. iii. 216, Ap. No. 16."], [469, "447 THE BAPTISM BY FIRE. but rather that the men to whom the interests of Bro- book testantism were so precious should have been so far chap. \"*. governed by a disposition to hope, and trust, and obey. The most damaging circumstance in Wyatt's insurrec tion consisted in the real or supposed league between the conspirators and the French court. But what was more natural than that men who accounted themselves as good as sold to Spain, should look to the old enemy of that power in the hope of some friendly offices. If in this policy they opposed themselves to the national feeling, Mary, by her manifest subserviency to her Spanish advisers, had offended against that same feel ing in a greater degree, and at much greater hazard both to national independence and to religious liberty. The Beconciliation Barliament, having done its work, The clouds was abruptly dissolved. Bole lost no time in remind- gather ing the clergy that the powers of which they had been so long deprived were restored to be used, and that they were expected to adopt measures for the sup pression of heresy in every form. Mild means were to be used in the first instance, but in all cases of obstinate resistance the body was to be saved by the severance of such corrupt members \u2014 in other words, all heretics who did not recant were to be sent to the stake.* The ecclesiastical court for each diocese became an inquisition for that district, restrained in scarcely anything by statute law or common law. In celebration of this great revolution in church affairs, the clergy paraded the streets in grand procession. No less than eight prelates, in their episcopal robes, with Bonner bearing the host, took their place after a long train of priests, that they might thus flaunt their triumph in the face of the Londoners.!

The ultimate autno- rity, in whose name all these proceedings took place, was the authority of her majesty's council, and the ecclesiastics in the council were greatly outnumbered by the laity included in it. In every stage of these severities the will of the council is pleaded as the great warrant for what is done, and the council is sometimes found stimulating the clergy to a greater zeal in their efforts utterly to subdue the heresy of the times. In such measures we no doubt see the influ- ence of Gardiner and his friends, but we see in them also the depth of servility to which the Arundels, the Pembrokes, and the Pagets could descend.* The reign of in iess than a week after the dissolution of the gins, Jan. parliament which sought and accepted reconciliation a, zs, 30. wjth Rome, the government began its reign of terror.

He wrote also many tracts and treatises in defence of the reformed faith. The man named Babington, warder of the Fleet prison while Hooper was lodged in that place, was there to do the bidding of Gardiner, and he inflicted much unwarranted suffering on the good prelate. The council had given instruction that the liberty of the prison should be ceded to him, but though the bishop gave the warder five pounds to * Strype, Eccles.

By intercession and by money he obtained permission to come to the common table at dinner and supper. But he was to speak to no one, and the meal over, he was led back to his solitude. This hap pened, too, though the fees paid by him were accord ing to the rate of a baron. The bed in his cell was a pallet of straw, with a rotten covering. The cell itself was a most offensive place. The common sewer from the whole prison passed down by the side of it towards the town ditch. The natural effects followed. His health failed. His heart was almost broken. The prisoners heard his moans, and pleaded that he should not be thus left to die. But they pleaded in vain. His death would be ' a good riddance,' was the answer of the warder. All this came upon me, said Hooper, from the bishop of Winchester, ' God's enemy and mine.'* Rogers was a man of learning, of blameless life, and Rogers. known to be devoted to the cause of Protestantism. He had assisted Tyndale and Coverdale in translating the Bible at Antwerp. On the accession of Edward, he had become distinguished in this country as a zealous and effective preacher, and in the public dis cussions of that time. When the prospect of affairs became threatening to all men of his description, his friends admonished him that his only safety would be in exile. But he appears to have judged that it would not be fitting that he should become a fugitive, while so many who had received the reformed doctrine from his lips were resolved to face the danger. He had, moreover, a wife and a large family. These he could not take with him, and his heart would not allow him to leave them. Bonner sent him to Newgate. Taylor and Saunders were intelligent, devout men, prepared to avow their faith and to die for it. f * Strype, Eccles. Mem. iii. 285. f Burnet, iii. 541 et seq. G G 11"], [472, "450 ROMANISTS AND PROTESTANTS. BOOK VIII, Chap. z. Proceedings against these par ties. Martyrdom of Rogers. The proceedings against these confessors may be briefly stated. Gardiner urged them all to reconsider , their opinions, and to save their lives by returning to ' the bosom of the Catholic Church. But all declared themselves Brotestants, and all were condemned. The bishop of Winchester knew well that nothing could tend so much to detract from the credit of the reformed faith, or to discourage its professors, as the recantation of such men. But the firmness of his victims disappointed him, and their firmness to the death was to add much to his feeling of mortification. It should be stated, that Gardiner was especially exas- perated at this juncture against the reformers, by the circumstance that some of them had reprinted one of his publications on the divorce controversy, in which he had spoken of Henry's marriage with Catherine as ' incestuous and unlawful,' and had commended the king highly in seeking a divorce, and in ' marrying his ' most godly and virtuous wife queen Anne.'* Gar- diner reminded Bogers, when upon his trial, that by describing the Church of Bome as Antichrist he con- demned the queen and the whole realm. ' Bogers ' said the queen would have done well enough if it had ' not been for his counsel. Gardiner said the queen ' went before them in those counsels, which proceeded ' of her own motion. Bogers said he would never be- ' lieve that. The bishop of Carlisle said they could all ' bear him witness to it. Bogers said they would all ' witness for one another. Upon that the comptroller, ' and secretary Bourne, being there, stood up in the ' court and attested it.'f Such, no doubt, was the part taken by the queen, from first to last, in relation to these proceedings ; and so reluctant were those who were to suffer so much from her hands to believe the worst concerning her. Bogers, on the morning of the seventh day after sentence had been passed upon him, was roused from * Burnet, iii. 540. t Ibid. 543."], [473, "451 THE BAPTISM BY FIRE. a heavy sleep, and told that he must prepare to go to book Smithfield. Bishop Bonner, it was said, was waiting clll^z to degrade him from his priesthood. If it be so, said the prisoner, still little more than half awake, there needs not any great care in adjusting my points. Hooper had been summoned at the same time, to undergo the same ceremony, though his time to suffer had not yet come. Certain priestly vestments were thrown over them, and taken off one by one, and then their priesthood had come to an end, and they were left to pass through their ordeal, not as priests but as laymen. Bogers petitioned Bonner, as he had before petitioned Gardiner, that he might be allowed to see his wife \u2014 but his petition found no favour with either. According to their maxims, it became him to repent of that connexion as an adulterous sin, instead of so cleaving to it. But on his way to the place of execu tion, his wife, with nine children, one an infant at the breast, were ready to greet him, to utter cheering words at his side as he passed along, and to welcome widowhood and orphanage, so the husband and the father might be seen to die the faithful death. The people all caught the infection of this feeling, and cheered the good man loudly. Nothing could be more self-possessed or noble than the manner in which this first in the list of Marian martyrs yielded his nature to the terrible penalty decreed against him \u2014 decreed by the council of an English queen, against opinions which had been pronounced not long since by convocations and parliaments as true and holy.* It was decided that Hooper should suffer at Bishop Gloucester, the city which had been the centre of his the^t\u2122 labours. It pleased him much that the council had so vietim determined. Nothing, to his feeling, could be more fitting than that he should die in attestation of the doctrine he had taught amidst the people to whom it had been especially addressed. He was conducted from * Foxe. Burnet. Strype. G G 2"], [474, "452 ROMANISTS AND PROTESTANTS. BOOK VIII Chap, z London to Gloucester on horseback. The journey was accomplished in three days. He reached that city about five in the morning, somewhile before day break. But it had been arranged that the authorities should meet him thus early, as the feeling of the district was known to be strongly in his favour, and there was apprehension of a rescue. Even at that hour the crowd of people was great. But Hooper's best friends were thoughtful and pious men, and were wise enough to see that the time had come in which good men were to serve the cause of truth by suffering for it, more than by acting for it. It had been ordered by the council that the ' detestable heretic ' should not be allowed to speak, either during his journey, or at the place of execution. But those about the pious man were constrained to be little mindful of that order. His friends had free access to him, and some, in the fuluess of their affection, would have had him save life by submission. But he shook his head at all suggestions of that sort, and counselled better things to his advisers. The mayor and aldermen came on his last evening to take leave of him. It strength ened him much to see them, and to find that his lessons to them in past days were not likely to be forgotten. He prayed them to see that the fire did its office as quickly as possible ; and added, ' If you ' think I do amiss in anything, hold up your fingers, ' and I have done, for I am not come hither as one ' enforced or compelled to die ; I might have had my ' life, as is well known, with worldly gain, if I would ' have accounted my doctrine falsehood and heresy.' The next morning came, a cold, rainy, February morning. But several thousand persons were present. The stake had been fixed in an open space, under the shadow of the cathedral, on a spot from which the bishop had often preached to out-door crowds of atten tive hearers. Looking round on the old place, and on so many faces, many of them old and familiar faces, he would fain have spoken once more of the things of"], [475, "THE BAPTISM BY FIRE. 453 which he had there spoken so often, but he remem- book bered the order \u2014 he must not only die, but, in common ci^*. with so many victims of Tudor cruelty, he must echo the bidding of the court, or die in silence. Sickly and lame, from the prison discipline to which the hu manity of his brother bishops had consigned him for a long time past, he made his way, by the help of his staff, to the fatal spot. Unhappily for him, though happily for themselves, the people of Gloucester had no experience in sending men out of the world after this barbarous manner. The ground was damp, the wood they brought was green. The rain and wind checked and scattered the flame. The torture began, but it was only the burning of the feet and legs. Much time passed, which to the sufferer must have been very long, and he was still seen wiping the sweat of agony from his brow. At length he cried out, ' More fire ! for God's love, good people, more fire ! ' More fire came, and a powder-bag which had been hung at his waist, in the hope of hastening his end, exploded. But even this did not do what was expected from it. Through full three-quarters of an hour the death-struggle was perpetuated. The last words heard from his lips were ' Lord Jesus, receive ' my spirit ! ' On the same day, Saunders stood exulting in the flames at Coventry; and Taylor exhibited the meekness of his Master on Aldham common, where his brutal executioners added blows to burning.* Deep was the discontent, and loud the talk, called Effect of forth by these proceedings. The expectation of Gar- Ceedings. diner seems to have been, that the Brotestants, when brought to the test, would recant, and that heresy, disgraced by such means, might be hushed, and kept down, until it should expire. That the men would suffer as they did, and that the people, and persons much above the crowd, would sympathize with them * Foxe, vol. vi. Burnet, iii. 546-548."], [476, "454 ROMANISTS AND PROTESTANTS. BOOK vm. Chap. z. as they did, was not the state of things which he had flattered himself would follow. The disposition to resist his policy, in place of being subdued, had be come tenfold stronger, and tenfold more manifest. While the old bishops, as the deposed Bomanist pre lates were called, were weak, and in some measure oppressed, they had many friends ; but men who had pitied them before, began to execrate them now. Six years, said the Brotestants, our friends were in pos session of the government, and not a drop of Bomanist blood was shed \u2014 and this is the return that is made to us. Not less than half the nation, they said, gravely believe as Bogers and Hooper believed, and are all these people to be coerced into perjured hypo crites, or to be sent as fuel to the fire? Beligious men might well ask that question, and statesmen might well ponder it.* Benard looked with alarm on the new feeling thus evoked. Bhilip shared in his apprehension. One of the king's chaplains preached a sermon in his presence denouncing the proceedings of the government as unchristian and unjust. Bhilip was no believer in such reasonable maxims, but he knew it to be prudent, necessary perhaps to his per sonal safety, to clear himself in this manner from the suspicion of having been a party to what was done. He even spoke of leaving the kingdom ; and Benard expressed his hope that he might not, in that case, be left behind. Of ten men who had been examined with Bogers, nine had resolutely confessed their faith, and had declared themselves willing to die in attesta tion of it. Bonner frowned on one of his victims, and demanded \u2014 canst thou bear the fire ? The man, * Mr. Hallani supposes the Protestants to be two-thirds of the nation at the close of this reign.

When the reform spirit began to partake of that temper, it became the men who had arrayed themselves against it to look well to their measures.* Now was the time for the Nationalists to have Failure of shown themselves true men. They had made the tionausts. queen to understand that she must desist from her course of vengeance against the followers of Wyatt ; that she must consent to leave the church property question undisturbed ; that she must abstain from all meddling with the succession ; from pressing the coro nation of her husband ; and from doing anything that might endanger the rights of Elizabeth \u2014 and could they not now have rallied on the maxim of Bhilip's chaplain, and have insisted that these attempts to sustain religion by means of such horrid spectacles should come to an end ? They might so have done. But with the vacillation and feebleness which beset them on all such matters, they caught at excuses for inaction, until the moment for action had passed away. Once more they had been weighed in the balances as a party, and found wanting. From this time, Gardiner ceases to be prominent in proceedings of this nature. The prime movers in all the severities which followed were Bonner, the car dinal, and the queen. The council consisted, partly of zealots who were prepared to conform to the wishes of the queen and her ecclesiastics to almost any extent ; and partly of latitudinarians, who persuaded themselves that a quiet acquiescence was to be preferred, even on public grounds, to the trouble and hazard of resistance. Only one month had passed since the executions The bum we have mentioned had taken place, when eight men taeiesare were sent by the bishop of London to edify the dis- renewed- * Foxe, vol. vi.

Tinder the charge of heresy. Five of these were me- chanics, but one was a priest, one is described as a gentleman, and another was a London apprentice not more than nineteen years of age. This youth was sent to die in his native village, where his parents were still living, and the people would be about him who had known him from his childhood. He sub- mitted to his martyr-death with a quiet firmness and dignity which tended much more to make heretics than to convert them. During the next month the martyr-roll was nearly doubled, one name in the augmented list being that of Ferrars, bishop of St. David's, who suffered at Carmarthen, and of whom the reader has seen something, as a young man, at Oxford.* Maty hopes Some time had now passed since the queen had flat mother\u2014 tered herself that she was about to become a mother. \u00bbhat was to Jn the hope of disposing the Almighty to look with favour on her circumstances, Mary resolved to give back to religious establishments whatever possessions had come to her from such sources. Her exchequer, which, without pressure upon her people, was to have been always in a prosperous condition, was in a state to occasion much solicitude to her ministers. But, in Mary's estimation, the birth of a child would have been the promise of salvation to an empire, and no sacrifice could be too great to secure such an object. f Marys hope All this spring the queen's event was supposed to IwhT*1 De near af hand. Every sort of preparation was made she has not for it. In April it was hourly expected. But it came punched not. Mary was not merely disappointed ; she became the heretics. unhappy, deeply distressed. What could she have done, was her inquiry, that the favour of Heaven should be thus withdrawn from her ? She besran to suspect, or was taught to suspect, that the cause was * Page 140. Foxe, vol. vi. vii. f Strype, Eccles. Mem. iii. Burnet, iii. 571, 572. Ap.

',. not to have made due use of her power for the extir- pation of heresy. The result was, that towards the end of May, a royal circular was sent to all the bishops, expressing surprise and regret that greater strictness had not been used to suppress prevalent errors, and commanding that measures should be taken to ensure that all persons charged with heresy should be made to abandon their opinions, or suffer ' accord ' ing to the order of the laws.' So Heaven was to be propitiated with new victims, and in the course of the next three months, more than fifty persons perished by fire within the provinces assigned to three only among the bishops, those of Canterbury, Bochester, and London. Every other diocese no doubt contri buted its share to the aggregate in this great peace offering.* But by the end of these three months the Many die answer to this propitiatory service had come ; and it is not pro was that the queen was not to give birth to prince P'Uated or princess. And now Mary's troubles became deep and lasting. Some historians wish us to believe, that had Mary become a mother, there would have been little or no persecution. But it should be remembered that the ' queen had commenced her burning policy with great earnestness, while she was fully expecting offspring. In the event, too, of her wishes in that respect being realized, great changes were to come. Beace was to be brought about between France and Spain. Spanish soldiers were to be transported from the Netherlands to this couutry. The English parliament was to be compelled to recognise the king's title to the throne. The kingdom was thus to be placed in thorough sub jection to a Spanish policy \u2014 that is, to the policy * Burnet, iii. 562. Ap. No. 20. Bradford's martyrdom was one of the ell'ects of this new outburst in the history of these persecutions. \u2014 Ibid. 564~567-"], [480, "458 ROMANISTS AND PROTESTANTS. BOOK VIII. Chap, a, which had taught Mary herself to look on the extir pation of heresy as the first duty of a Catholic sovereign.* In either case, our poor country was doomed to pass through a fiery ordeal. It is admitted that Mary's childlessness had a considerable influence on her conduct as a persecutor; but had there not been failure in that respect, the persecution would have been greater \u2014 not less. Tragedies and slaughter Like those in the Spanish Netherlands would have had their place in our history. Mary regarded herself as bound to suppress heresy to the extent of her power, and the greater her power, the greater would have been her obligation in that direction. Two courses of events were possible, and Providence mercifully allotted to us the course fraught with the least calamity. Philip could not settle his continental difficulties so as to be at liberty to attempt anything by force in England. Without offspring by the queen he had no prospect even of a regency. Elizabeth stood as heir apparent. So his marriage had proved in nearly all respects a failure. How to escape from a yoke so little agreeable to him became his great object. Had the crown been by any means within his reach as the husband of Mary, he would have spared no pains to ensure that there should be no queen Elizabeth. But in present circumstances, it was to the interest of Spain that the life of that princess should be guarded, and that her rights should be sustained. In the absence of Elizabeth, the next person in succession was the queen of Scots, whose accession would naturally tend to league England, France, and Scot land against the power of Spain. Philip, accordingly, endeavoured to prevail on the queen to become recon ciled to her sister, though with little apparent success ; and his majesty laid strict injunctions on official persons to conform themselves to the wishes of the princess, and to be watchful of her safety. * Noailles, Ambassades, vol. iv. 330-333.

Dgai But it came ; and the weeks to which the absence of the king was to have been restricted passed away, and he did not return. Months also passed, and the prospect of his coming back seemed to recede with time. Mary felt herself not only childless, but hus bandless. Nor could she longer conceal from her self, that she had married a man, who, in place of being the model of purity which Benard had affirmed, was capable of avoiding her society that he might give himself to licentious indulgence in its lowest forms. So all the fond visions on which the queen had gazed so often were dissolved and gone ! In these circumstances, the narrow religious train- \" ing to which Mary had been subject, left her toeverunhap become the victim of the most distressing illusions. {J^^&e Affliction, instead of being viewed as a means of dis- r\"our \u00b0{ o Heaven dt cipline, and as often coming most upon the best, she new cruei was disposed to interpret as a sign of the Divine anger. tics' And now the question came again \u2014 In what had she offended that Heaven should have sent these dark clouds upon her path ? Her principal advisers at this time must have been Bonner and the cardinal. Gar diner did not encourage such thoughts, and was himself near his end. Bonner, too, was not so much the counsellor of the queen, as her instrument. The blame of what was done during this memorable winter, when Latimer, Cranmer, and Bidley, and so many more, were sent to their death, must be divided between Mary and the cardinal.* We see no room to doubt that this sickly and sorrowing woman became * ' His opinion [Pole] is of such authority with the queen, that, by a mere sign of his hand, he could remove any person from the situation he holds, or bring him to punishment ; whence he is envied and hated by the principal ministers.' \u2014 Micheli's Report."], [482, "460 ROMANISTS AND PROTESTANTS. BOOK VIII, Chap, z, Latimer Ridley, and Cranmer. in this respect all that the courtly and scholarly enthusiast, to whom her conscience had been sur rendered, was disposed she should become. If Bole often counselled that heretics should be won, if pos sible, by mild means, he spoke in that respect only as such men have commonly spoken. Ecclesiastics have always seen, that heretics who recant, do the greatest possible damage to their faith ; while those who die for it, often give it root, sanctity, and power. But, accord ing to Bole's philosophy, the men who would not recant should die. If his hand was ever stayed in relation to such cases, it was from the dictates of prudence, not from a sense of duty.* Latimer was sent to the Tower a few weeks after the queen's accession. His enemies knew that harsh dealing with him would be most unpopular. They would rather, therefore, that he had fled, and timely notice of his intended arrest was conveyed to him, in the hope that he might be disposed to make his escape. But he waited the summons of his prosecutors, and obeyed it when it came. On entering the Tower, he found an old acquaintance in the office of warder, and with the light-hearted honesty which never forsook him, he said, 'Ah! my friend \u2014 how do you? You ' see I am come to be your neighbour again.' As the winter came on, the old man suffered severely from cold, and sent a message to the lieutenant saying, that if more care were not taken of him, he should ' give 'him the slip.' Cranmer, too, while he advised others -to save themselves by flight, felt that ' it would be in ' no ways fitting for him to go away.' The part which * Burnet, who, in common with many of our historians, is disposed to regard Pole as being personally opposed to persecution, supposes him to have assented to these cruel proceedings, even in his own diocese of Can terbury, to gratify the clergy and prelates, and from apprehension that his enemies in Rome would have charged him with a criminal laxity had he taken a more humane course. But the facts and documents of the times seem to me to be strongly against such a conclusion. (Hist. Res. iii. 567, 568.)

It happened, that nearly two years from that time passed before Latimer, Cranmer, and Bidley were put upon their trial as heretics in Oxford.* During those two years, as the reader has seen, the opinions of the council were much divided, and even the Spanish ambassador, while calling for the greatest severity against traitors, was urging caution and moderation in dealing with questions purely religious. But now, the nation had been reconciled to Bome ; the queen had become the wife of Bhilip ; and Bhilip had retired to the conti nent, leaving the queen to her feeling and her con fessor. How bravely Latimer and Bidley submitted * ' Concerning Ridley,' says Dr. Turner, dean of Wells, writing to Foxe, ' I am able to say more things, and more certain than you have set down in your book, being born in the same county with him, and many years his collegian in Pembroke Hall, and his opponent in theological exercises. He was born in Northumberland, and sprung of the genteel pedigree of the Ridleys. After his return from the foreign universities, he lived with us in Pembroke Hall, but at length was called away from us to the bishop of Canterbury, whom he served faithfully.

In this interval, nearly three hundred persons, of both sexes, passed through this terrible baptism, and not less than another hundred are said to have died from torture, want, or ill-usage while in prison. f The longer these . severities continued, the more merciless they became. The passions of the persecutors were exasperated, not appeased, by the policy they had pursued. For awhile, life might always have been obtained by recantation, but in the end even this vestige of moderation disappeared. The patient en durance, of defiant triumph, with which the sufferers passed through their death-strife, and the bold out spoken sympathy of spectators, were as gall and wormwood to those who had hoped to reduce the nation to a quiet submission by such spectacles. One of Bole's latest acts, was to declare to the citizens of London, that heresy was a greater crime than murder, adultery, or treason ; to complain heavily of the favour which the citizens had shown to such criminals ; and to describe the constancy of the martyrs, by which the people were so much influenced, as nothing better than a satanic obstinacy.

In fact, Mary could not avoid seeing, that all her Mar>r'a proceedings seemed to take the blight of misfortune continue along with them. Through the connexion of the uament,par' court with Spain, this country was drawn into a war and death with France and Scotland ; while the disorders of its finances, and of everything relating to the government,. exceeded anything known in our history since the time of the civil wars. It is at such a moment that Mary proposes to transfer the first-fruits of all vacant livings from the crown to the pope, to whom they were formerly paid; and joins with Pole in raising anew the complaint against those laymen who con tinued to be holders of ecclesiastical property. But Oct. isss^ this was a topic on which even the parliaments of this reign could be resolute. The nobles spoke of appeal ing to their swords if anything should come up about church lands ; and the commons reminded her majesty that a government with two expensive wars upon its hands, and burdened with debt, should be better em ployed than in voting away a large revenue like the first-fruits to a foreign power, and that, too, a power with which the government was at war. Mary, find ing she could do nothing with this assembly, dismissed it iu anger, and punished the free speech of several members of the lower house by sending them to prison.* No marvel, in such circumstances, if plots and conspiracies were abroad. But so did difficulty * Part. Hist. i. 625-628. The first-fruits and tenths were not to be paid in future to the pope or to the crown, but were to be retained by the church and appropriated in various ways for her benefit, according to the discretion of the lord legate, cardinal Pole.

The queen did not long survive that event, and her death must be attributed to mental as much as to physical causes.* We have seen that the Bomanists under Mary did not acquire their ascendancy over the Brotestants at once. The first legislative movement halted in Na tionalism ; and it was left to another parliament, and to other influences, to displace Nationalism in favour of the order of things which had preceded. The only points on which the Beconciliation Barliament did not accede to the wishes of the queen and her clergy, were points relating to property. The pope was received as the spiritual head of Christendom, and as holding all his ancient spiritual relations to this kingdom. But the church lands possessed by laymen were still to be possessed by them, and, in some respects, the court of Bome was not to be en riched from the revenues of the English church as in former ages. In all other matters the past was to return. The doctrine of the church was to be what it had been before the accession of Henry VIII., and the power of the clergy to deal with opinion was to be what it had been in the time of the Lollards. Such was the amount of revolution involved in the reaction which reached its culminating point in 1555. * ' Some personal infirmities under which she [Mary] labours are the causes to her of both private and public affliction ; to remedy them recourse is had to frequent blood-letting, and this is the real cause of her paleness, and the general weakness of her frame. The cabal she has been exposed to the evil disposition of the people towar-ds her, the present poverty and debt of the crown, and her passion for king Philip, from whom she is doomed to live separate, are so many other causes of grief by which she is overwhelmed. She is, moreover, a prey to the hatred she hears my lady Elizabeth, and which has its source in the recollection of the wrongs she experienced on account of her mother, and in the fact that all eyes and hearts are turned towards my lady Elizabeth as successor to the throne.' \u2014 Micheli's Report."], [487, "465 THE BAPTISM BY FIRE. In 1558, the queen, to whom all this concession had book been made, by a large majority in parliament, if not clS^a, by a majority in the nation, had become more an Th7^r. object of disaffection with all ranks than any sovereign tion. in the history of this country since the time of king John. Mary ascended the throne amidst bright hopes and loyal acclamations. The news of her death was as the passing away of a dark nightmare terror, which allowed the nation to breathe again. In recovering its consciousness, its execration of the power which had so weighed upon it was soon manifest. How are these changes, so marked, and succeeding causes of each other so soon, to be explained ? We have seen {son\"\"\" what the circumstances and influences were which had given Mary her crown, and the popularity which at tended her accession. The tendencies towards reac tion were soon visible. The people saw that the mass was restored on state occasions without any waiting for the sanction of parliament ; that the Brotestant prelates were deposed and imprisoned, and Bomanists raised to their place, without due form of law ; that court preachers could at once assume a strong anti protestant tone in their discourses ; and, above all, that the queen and her instruments were using every means to ensure a suppression of the ecclesiastical changes introduced under Edward, and to bring back as much as possible of thorough Bomanism. All this, too, was done, in violation of her reiterated pledge to leave what had been settled in the time of her brother as he had left it. The suspicion and discontent thus awakened, became much more formidable, when Mary's proposed marriage with Bhilip alarmed the nationality of the country, by menacing it with a subjection to Spanish influences ; and alarmed its piety no less, by threatening to bring the intolerance of Spain into the place of the comparative religious freedom which had been realized by Englishmen. From these apprehen sions sprang Wyatt' s insurrection. But it was not until the reconciliation with Bome II H H"], [488, "466 ROMANISTS AND PROTESTANTS. BOOK VIII. Chap, z had been accomplished, nor until the queen's govern ment began its career of crime against humanity in the name of religion, that the instinct of the nation rose against the new power, and gave expression in so many ways to abhorrence of its proceedings. To understand the impression made on the mind of Eng land by those proceedings we must look much beyond the number of the persons who perished in the flames. The conscience of at least a third of the nation was deeply moved by this crisis. Men and women who had embraced the doctrine of the reformers, felt that to be faithful to their convictions, would be to hazard tho loss of all things ; and to be unfaithful, would be to surrender their religious peace. Buin in this world or the next was the choice placed before them. The amount of mental anguish resulting from the conflict thus raised the Omniscient only could know. Multi tudes, to escape from the necessity of facing this dreadful alternative, became exiles ; and in those days, when English families were much more fixed to their homesteads than now, even exile was felt as a dis tressing calamity.* Suffering at the stake, moreover, was brief, and in reality even light, compared with the continued pressure of misery \u2014 the lingering death, entailed on many as prisoners under the charge of heresy. If a hundred persons are known to have died under this treatment, how many more may be sup posed to have endured miseries which fell somewhat short of the insufferable? Darkness and cold, filth and want, sickness and sorrow, all did their work on such victims. Jails and jailors in our history, were associated with horrors sufficiently appalling not a century ago, but the eighteenth century was humane, in this respect, compared with the sixteenth. It should be remembered, too, that every victim at the stake, or sent to the cells of the inquisitors, had been * Strype makes the known emigrants to be not less than 800.\u2014 Cranmer, c. 15."], [489, "467 THE BAPTISM BY FIRE. BOOK VIII Chap. torn from a circle of neighbours, friends, and relatives. In apprehending such persons, and in the course of proceeding against them, natural affection was often grossly outraged, kindred being threatened with death on refusing to become witnesses or informers against kindred. To obtain information against suspected persons torture was used without scruple.* Hence, when a delinquent was snatched from a district, thought of the disclosures that might be extorted, was sufficient to send terror to the heart of all who were left. Of all the classes who fell under these evil in fluences, perhaps the greatest sufferers would be found among those who saved themselves by recantation. We know that some of these, conscience-smitten and heart-broken, challenged the death at last, from which they had shrunk at first ; and that to some life so dis honoured became insupportable. Nor should we forget, -that among the clergy, great numbers during the last reign had become married men, and on that ground alone were now expelled from their livings, and cast, for the most part, in poverty and homelessness on so ciety. In the spring of 1554, more than forty clergy men in the diocese of Bath and Wells were deprived of their cures for this cause within the space of two months, and the process went on to the spring of the year following. What was done in this respect in one diocese, may be supposed to have been done very generally. f It is only by taking in all these aspects of the policy pursued by the queen and her council, that we * Cuthbert Simpson, a man in deacon's orders, ' was put to much tor ture. He lay three hours upon the rack ; besides two other inventions of torture were made use of to make him discover all those in London who met in their private assemblies, but he would tell nothing.' \u2014 Burnet, iii. 657. Simpson was burnt in Smithfield. t Strype, iii. 352, 353. Parker, archbishop of Canterbury, who lived through those times, reckoned these sufferers at 1 2,000. Burnet is probably nearer the truth in limiting them to 3000. The numbers at the lowest estimate may suffice to show the extent to which a disposition to conform the new order of things had made way among the clergy under Edward. H H 2"], [490, "468 ROMANISTS AND PROTESTANTS. BOOK VIII Chap. z. can judge adequately concerning the feeling of the English people towards Mary and her government at the time of her decease. It was no small matter that the queen's general policy should have been so feeble, and that disgrace and disaster should have been fol lowed by that crowning dishonour the loss of Calais. But a proud nation found it especially difficult to bear with such a course of affairs, when it was remembered that all this had happened, partly as the consequence of Mary's personal devotion to the interests of Spain, as centred in her Spanish husband ; and partly as the natural result of those narrow conceptions which had taught her to account all policy as insignificant, com pared with the duty of upholding a factitious creed, and a persecuting priesthood. The first Brotestant power in English history was the power under Edward, and compared in its religious policy with the Bomanist power under Mary, the ad vantage was immensely in its favour. Comparing the two reigns, it would seem to be clear, either that Bro testantism is greatly more tolerant than Bomanism ; or that Bomanism has in it nothing of the spirit of martyrdom, if compared with the rival faith. Ques tionable as either of these conclusions may be deemed, recent events were strongly in favour of the one or the other, if not of both, and could hardly fail of being so regarded by a large portion of the English people. Bole was so much alive to the impression made on the public mind by these facts, that in his address to the citizens of London, he has employed all the resources of his rhetoric in an endeavour to remove it. But the martyrdom of More, and Fisher, and the Carthusians, which he sets forth in all the odour of sanctity, was not martyrdom inflicted by a Protestant government, but by a king boasting of being a Catholic ; and the assertion that those deeply injured men suffered for truth, while the slain under Mary suffered for error, and in sheer obstinacy, was an assumption, and was resented as insult added to mis-"], [491, "469 THE BAPTISM BY FIRE. representation. In fact, the feeling of Pole and Mary book at the last, evidently was, that they had tried their Chv *\"\u00bb. final expedient and had failed \u2014 that the faith they would have destroyed had only acquired reputation, power, and probable triumph, as the result of their mistaken and cruel proceedings. The people of Spain, whose whole history had been a war against men regarded as enemies to their religion, and with whom the capital punishment of such enemies had been at all times familiar, might learn to hate the heretic as they had hated the Moor. But it was not so in England. The English were not so much counter parts to the Spaniards as to the Flemings. With the former, the auto de se was a holiday festival ; with the latter, it was a time in which to give loud utterance to discontent, to pelt the executioners with stones, and to rescue the victims from the stake. Much may no doubt be said in extenuation of the Maiy. heavy fault chargeable on the unhappy queen. Mary had reached her eleventh year when the troubles of her mother on the matter of the divorce began, and she was seventeen when that question came to its close. Her mother died soon afterwards. From that mother, and from such confessors as that mother would naturally choose, Mary received those impressions concerning religion which she never lost. Nor must it be forgotten, that those Spanish attachments which are so observable in her history, and which did so much towards making the later portion of it sad and dark, had been imbibed along with that high Castilian language which she had learnt from her mother's lips. In childhood she had been betrothed to Charles, afterwards the emperor; and though not more than ten years of age when that contract was abandoned, she was old enough to feel some childish disappointment, and to be capable of remembering that such a relation between herself and the emperor had once existed. To the papal church her mother had looked as to her friend in her trouble, her strength in \\ftx weakness."], [492, "470 ROMANISTS AND PROTESTANTS. BOOK VIII, Chap, z. In the people inclined to the new doctrine, Catherine saw, as she supposed, the enemies of her cause, and the friends of the woman who had become her rival. What marvel, if the daughter who had prattled at her knees, and grown up to the verge of womanhood at her side, was found, not only to be a Bomanist \u2014 but a Bomanist more after the Spanish type, than after the English. Mary, indeed, as the reader has seen, had professed in the time of her father to renounce all the pretensions of the papacy, and to be, as he was, an Anglo-Catholic. But her subsequent course forbids our supposing that she really felt at that time as she spoke. Her veracity and sincerity, though generally credible, were not unimpeachable. The interference Avith her religious prepossessions in the time of her brother, appears to have deepened her old feeling in favour of Bomanism. It probably cost her something to promise protection and freedom to English Brotestants : but it does not appear to have cost her anything to ignore that promise, when she flattered herself that she might do so with safety. Her accession to the throne came upon her as a burst of sunshine after a cloudy and stormy day, and for a season she sincerely rejoiced in it. But though she spoke then of being wedded to her people, there was not an Englishman about her in whom she could confide, and her private resolve was, that she would never marry an Englishman. The man to whom she disclosed her real thoughts, and who, until her marriage, may be said to have governed her, was Benard, the Spanish ambassador. The adviser to whom she looked in all her difficulties was the emperor. Sovereigns do not find equals among their subjects, and, in consequence, know little of real friendship. Their choice commonly lies between having no friend, or incurring the penal ties of favouritism. In the case of Mary, this isolation of royalty is especially observable. But the betrothed of Charles soon became the betrothed of Bhilip ; and soon the state of public feeling; the ill-concealed"], [493, "471 THE BAPTISM BY FIRE. indifference of her husband ; her disappointment and book mortification in regard to her supposed pregnancy ; the CJ^X accumulation of debt, disorder, and disaster ; and her rapidly declining health \u2014 all combined to place her at the mercy of the worst influences of the superstition in which she had been educated. Her course towards the Wyatt insurgents showed the relentless Tudor temper in which she was prepared to rule. The gibbet had never been so used in London as it was then used. Nor had there ever been an execution in its annals evincing such an absence of all pity as the execution of lady Jane Grey. Mary, in the estimation of those who are disposed to take the most favourable view of her character, was a woman of amiable feeling in domestic life, of high principle, and of conscientious and earnest piety. But, if the case was so, the question comes \u2014 What must that religious system have been, which taught an amiable woman to do such deeds ; a woman of high principle to be so little mindful of her word and obli gation ; and a woman of deep piety to look on hundreds of men and women burning at the stake, as the most fitting offering with which to appease the wrath of the object of her worship ? Bole, and Gardiner, and Bonner were representative men. So were Cranmer, Latimer, and Hooper. Their characters give us the outline of parties. Bole declined promotion in the English church, cardinal promotion that might have led to the primacy, and chose the life of an exile, rather than surrender the prepossessions and sympathies which bound him to the Catholic church. How far this decision was really the decision of conscience, or the result of taste, or of some feeling of a lower kind, is beyond our knowledge, and was, no doubt, in great part, a secret even to himself. The papal hierarchy was present to his imagination as it was his pleasure to conceive of it, much more than as it was in reality. It was pleasant to him to gaze upon it as a vast spiritual fabric, admirable in its"], [494, "472 ROMANISTS AND PROTESTANTS. BOOK VIII. Chap. z. symmetry, gorgeous in its symbolism, the offspring of a celestial inspiration, and the great medium through which the Deity condescends to communicate with mortals, and to enrich them with his favour. In comparison with this spiritual sovereignty, thus especially God-given, all other sovereignties were essentially limited and poor ; and in comparison with the gifts bestowed through this unearthly power, all other gifts were necessarily trivial, perishable, of the earth, earthy. Under the shadow of this heaven-born guardianship, men might dwell securely, if they could only be made to see their own danger ; and under its more than maternal care they might be nurtured to all good, if they could only be made to see their need. Such freedom as this power had ceded to men was good for them, everything beyond that must lead to evil, to infinite evil. Hence, to rebel against this authority was a treason deeper unspeakably in its guilt than any earthly treason. But what shall we say of the understanding which could accept this vision as a reality in the presence of a world of facts proclaiming it a fiction ? It is evident that the understanding and the reason had little to do with Bole's conclusions. They had their origin rather in his imagination, and in his \u00e6sthetic feeling. Flis eloquence was full, high-toned, apparently inexhaus tible, and strongly imbued with scriptural language and allusion. But the Bible in his hand became a book of allegories, or of ingenious analogies which served him in the place of reasons. The Catholic church was present to his mind as it is often seen by women, and as it is rarely seen by educated men. He lived a pure life, and he would have had all men of his order live pure lives. But his belief was charged with intoxi cating elements. It prompted him to speak as in the name of God. It fed his egotism and arrogance enormously. It led him to confide in the dictates of his own passions, as in the voice of an oracle ; and to imagine that he had only to speak, and men would"], [495, "THE BAPTISM BY FIRE. 473 see as he saw, or at least ought so to do. His mind cook was often so disturbed by these influences, that he failed chap, a, to see the nicer shades of truth, gratitude, and inte grity, where interests of that order might be served by slighting them. Above all, believing in the Catholic church after this manner, he not only learnt to look on her adversaries as the adversaries of God, but to suppose that he did the weightiest service to the Deity and to humanity, by persecuting such persons to the death. Bole, nevertheless, was a favourable specimen of the better class of Catholics \u2014 the cultivated, imaginative, and really devout class. Gardiner was a man of quite another order. He Gardiner. was endowed with some political sagacity. No dream of the fancy or imagination ever led him astray. Briestly refinement had not much influence upon him. But his heart was set on priestly power. He was, in truth, a coarse man \u2014 coarse in language, in feeling, and in habit. He had his convictions in relation to certain things as being either true or expedient, and he suffered for those convictions. But he could say and unsay on a large scale, and no blush came when reminded of his gross inconsistency. In one letter, written by him concerning the proceedings of the government soon after Edward's accession, he has ex pressed himself in such terms as a Christian bishop might have been expected to employ.* But the rules of truth and honesty which he there commends so justly, were not allowed to govern his own ways more than very partially : and the right words he there emplo}rs, and appears to have employed not un frequently, touching the security and freedom which the sovereignty of parliamentary law had conferred on the Englishman, were words, unhappily, which he could remember or forget according to the occasion. During his residence in Bome on the divorce errand, he had seen so much of the infirmity that might beset * Burnet, iii. Collect. 13."], [496, "474 ROMANISTS AND PROTESTANTS. BOOK VIII. CnAP. z. Bonner. a college of cardinals and a sovereign pontiff, as to have become personally indifferent to anything that popes or conclaves might say or do. But whether England was to sustain its old relation to the papacy, or to stand apart from it, the English bishop, in his view, was to be the same man in all his functions If Mary could have been content with the Anglo-Catho licism which her father had introduced, Gardiner would have been content with it. But he would have been a persecutor under the rule of the Six Acts, as much as under the dictates of Bole and the papacy. Gardiner, too, in all these respects, was the type of a class of English Catholics, and of a much larger class than that represented by Bole. Gardiner and Bonner were men of the same mould, but in the latter all the exceptionable qualities of the former were exaggerated. He is described as of a convivial temperament, with occasional indications of right feeling ; and there was a time, it seems, when even Bonner became weary in the work of cruelty, and his royal mistress deemed it necessary to stimulate his flagging zeal. But when Gardiner began to distrust the faggot process, Bonner was the instrument to supply his place, and he ceased not to be thus promi nent so long as this dark reign lasted. He possessed nothing of the dignity proper to his office. He could mix up a low levity with his cruelties. He could add insult to revenge. He could trample on his victim when disarmed and prostrate. The vulgar insolence of the language in which he addressed Cranmer when degrading him from his office preparatory to his exe cution, may be cited as characteristic of the man : \u2014 '.This is the man,' exclaimed this bishop of London, ' that hath despised the pope's holiness, and now is to 'be judged by him ; this is the man that has pulled ' down so many churches, and now is come to be ' judged in a church ; this is the man that has con ' temned the blessed sacrament of the altar, and now ' is come to be condemned before that blessed sacra-"], [497, "475 THE BAPTISM BY FIRE. ' ment hanging over the altar ; this is the man, that, book ' like Lucifer, sat in the place of Christ upon an altar ch^.'z ' to judge others, and now is come before an altar to ' be judged himself.'* Cranmer deserved better treatment even from the cranmer. hands of Bonner. Henry VIII. was a shrewd judge of character, and in his estimation, the archbishop was a man much too guileless and confiding to keep his own as opposed to the policy and craft of the bad men who were often uppermost during this period in our history. It was the lot of the primate to witness the fall of several eminent persons to whom he felt bound by grateful attachment. His was the only voice raised in behalf of Anne Boleyn and of Crom well, when their adversity came upon them. His in fluence was exerted no less honourably in favour of Somerset, when the duke came into his first trouble ; and in the after trouble, he hazarded the displeasure of Northumberland by ' showing his conscience secretly' as one not satisfied with the proceedings of that noble man against his rival. f He no doubt concurred in what was done in the case of Joan Bocher, and in the case of Van Baris. This was a grave fault in his life. The enemies of the Reformation were eager to accuse it of giving licence to all kinds of heresy ; and the primate, with his characteristic caution and timidity, had persuaded himself that it became him to guard the sacred cause against a charge so injurious. The reserved protest under which he accepted the sanction of the papacy to his consecration as primate, does not admit of vindication. Concerning the part taken by him in relation to lady Jane Grey little need be said.

Compared with the men of his time, Cranmer was tolerant and humane, and incurred the reproach of the zealots on that ground. His spirit in his last moments was the true martyr-spirit, such as became the man who in an age of church-robbing retained clean hands in that matter ; who, while others were venting their selfish nature in intrigue and conspiracy, avoided all such practices, kept to his retreat at Lambeth, and there prosecuted his quiet labour in issuing Bibles, homilies, articles, and other helps, to meet the religious wants of the people; and laboured especially in translating those ancient prayers, which, as set forth in the book to be used in our churches, were to come, from their simpli city, pathos, and beauty, as the breathing of a new life and hope into the hearts of myriads through the next three centuries. All that is most precious in the English church may be traced to the mind of Cranmer more than to any other mind \u2014 to that admixture of reverence for the past and sympathy with the freer thought of the present, which qualified him to adjudi cate between the old and the new with a high order of wisdom. His learning, and piety, and moderation, place him before us as reflecting one of the best phases of the English mind in his time \u2014 that which was to survive in the future English church, and. to be its strength and beauty. In such labours he found an able and genial coadjutor in Bidley. If Cranmer was the representative of the more thoughtful and moderate Brotestantism of his time, Latimer may be said to have represented the religious life which had its seat in the instinct and feeling of the people, and which may be described as the Bro testantism of the heart \u2014 the offspring, not so much of logic as of intuition. His preaching was Brotestant in its substance and tendency, while as yet men were"], [499, "477 THE BAPTISM BY\" FIRE. BOOK VIII Chap. z. sent to the stake in punishment of the opinions to which that name was given. His concern, as he often said, was not with what might be accounted as Lu theranism or the contrary, but with what was mani festly true, honest, and real. His New Testament wras in his hand, and his avowed object was to teach reality as it had been there taught. He did not see, as we have said elsewhere, that in taking this ground he was assuming the right of private judgment, and rejecting the dogma of an infallible church. He simply meant to say that religion in his view was a power from Heaven which made men sincere, in place of leaving them hypocrites ; honest, in place of leaving them rogues ; and devout, in place of leaving them formalists. If to preach after this manner was to be suspected of Lutheranism, that was to be regretted, but it must be his to preach after this manner. He must be allowed to denounce grimace and fraud as being grimace and fraud, and to commend the true, and just, and good, as being true, and just, and good. If, in pursuing this course, it became him to say sharp things concerning prelates and people, concerning traders in their traffic, and drones in their religious houses, what it became him to say he was resolved should be said. During a long interval he can hardly be said to have preached the doctrine of the kingdom. His mission was to prepare the way for such preaching. His doctrine of repentance and of remission of sins, limited as it was, tended much to make the rough places smooth, and the crooked straight. In all these respects he was not only a voice preparing the way for what was to follow, but a voice which gave ex pression to the new thoughts and passions that were then labouring for utterance among no small portion of the people, especially in towns and cities. Latimer had his work to do ; and the light given him went so far and no farther, that his work might be done. The time came in which Latimer himself was to ripen to a fuller man, and the people to whom his voice had been"], [500, "478 ROMANISTS AND PROTESTANTS. BOOK VIII, Chap. 2 Hooper. so long familiar ripened with him. Both found them selves committed to a formal rejection of Bomanism, almost without being aware of the tendencies of the process which had brought them to that issue. Hooper possessed some qualities in common with Latimer. He was a man of simple-minded piety. He combined much tenderness of heart with strict purity of life, and with a strict determination to exact that purity from others, especially from the clergy. He was also highly popular as a preacher, and earn estly devoted to labour in that form. But here the points of resemblance end. What remains is differ ence, if not contrast. Hooper had passed some time in exile among the foreign Brotestants. This circum stance, along with the cast of his mind, disposed him to examine the dogmas and usages of Bomanism with greater freedom than was permitted at that time in England. In consequence, he drew a line of separa tion between that system and Brotestantism which proved to be more Puritan than Anglican. We have seen, that, from this cause, he had to complain of some hard treatment, even from the hands of such men as Cranmer and Bidley. The germ of Buritan feeling as it then existed in England, and as it was to be developed in our history, may be said to have been represented by the good bishop who ended his course amidst the fire in the cathedral court at Gloucester. The con science which demurred so strongly to the use of the popish vestments, was essentially the conscience which was to become distinctive of English Puritanism."], [501, "BOOK IX.

The health of the cardinal had been declining for some time past. But in his case, too, the fever which brought life to a close, had its connexion probably with vexation and disappointment. England had not been won to the Catholic church; was not likely so to be. Bole had aspired more than once to fill the papal chair. Baul IV. had not only been his rival, butwas his enemy.

The pope had allied himself with France, and the policy of the English govern ment \u2014 though just grounds of complaint against the French king were not wanting \u2014 was known to have been dictated by Spain.

BOOK IX Chap. i. Sir William Cecil. houses recognised the accession of the new sovereign. The proclamation of Elizabeth as queen was then made, at Westminster Hall, Temple Bar, and the Exchange, amidst abundant expressions of delight and loyalty on the part of the populace. Elizabeth had recently entered on the twenty-sixth year of her age. When not more than seventeen, beside the female accomplishments usual in that age, she had acquired a knowledge of French, Italian, and Latin, and some acquaintance with Greek. At a later period, she read freely, not only in the Latin of Livy, but in the Greek of the New Testament, and in that of Isocrates and Sophocles. From the gravity of her early studies, her brother Edward had given her the name of Sister Tem perance. It must be confessed, that these very learned occupations, and the comparative seclusion in which her early life had passed, gave a frequent air of pedantry to her taste and manner, which is not to her advantage as compared with lady Jane Grey, or with Catherine Parr. But she possessed a much more masculine capa city than either of those distinguished persons, and such as qualified her in an extraordinary degree to fill the high place which Brovidence had now assigned to her. We have seen, that in the schooling to which Elizabeth had been subject, the discipline of adversity had not been wanting. The great adviser of the queen at this juncture, was Sir William Cecil, who at once became tier secretary of state.* This statesman, as Sir William Cecil aud as lord Burleigh, holds a conspicuous place in this portion of our history. He came from the stock of our English gentry. His father, Bichard Cecil, Esq., * Elizabeth's words to Cecil are characteristic. ' I give you this charge that you shall be of my privy council, and content yourself to take pains for me and my realm. This judgment I have of you, that you will not be corrupted with any manner of gift, and that you will he faithful to the state, and that without respect to my private will, you will give me that counsel that you think best ' \u2014 Harrington's Nugce Antiqu\u0153, i. 56. II I I"], [504, "482 ANGLICANS AND ROMANISTS. BOOK IX Chap. I, was yeoman of the wardrobe under Henry VIII. In 1541, William Cecil was a student at the inns of court, and was then twenty-one years of age. _ In the following year, he married the sister of Sir John Cheke. In 1544, Sir John became tutor to prince Edward, and through his influence, Cecil's connexion with the court would seem to have commenced. Three years later he is known as filling the office of private secretary to the duke of Somerset. He does not appear to have become secretary of state before 1550. His capacity for public business was of a high order, and he was influenced through life by a strong dis position towards such employments. When his first master, the duke of Somerset, came into his troubles, Cecil took care, as the reader has seen, not to be in volved in them. The duke resented his conduct as betraying a want of fidelity and gratitude. It is certain, that Cecil passed from the confidence of Somerset, to become the great instrument of the good or bad in the government of his rival, the duke of Northumberland. Cecil had been fully committed, though with some reluctance and misgiving, to what was done in favour of lady Jane Grey ; and had been one of the first to see that scheme as a failure, and one of the most active in endeavouring to propitiate Mary's government, by hastening the overthrow of the government opposed to her. It is probable that office would have been open to him on Mary's accession, if he could have avowed himself a convert to the queen's religion. Subsequently, when the intolerance of the government diffused so much terror, Cecil consented to do, for the sake of life, as not a few men of his class did \u2014 he conformed in religious matters to what the law had so imperatively enjoined. In those evil times, Cecil appears to have found more occupation in hus bandry than in state affairs \u2014 though we find his name, strange to say, in the list of persons deputed to con duct Cardinal Bole to this country on his mission to reconcile England to Bome. On the whole, we may"], [505, "483 THE ECCLESIASTICAL SETTLEMENT. believe that Sir William Cecil was in conviction a bookix. Brotestant, but his religion was that of the statesman, CnAP' '\" rather than that of the martyr or the saint. His general policy, too, was evidently of that flexible kind, which allows a man to become a party to many things which, in his own estimation, are neither wise nor good, for the sake of much better objects, which he could not hope to see accomplished in the absence of such compliances. The science of politics has much to do with great principles, but it is, nevertheless, in a special degree, a science of compromise \u2014 a science in which something has nearly always to be ceded, for the sake of something which could not otherwise be gained. No general rule can be laid down to deter mine the morality or immorality of such concessions. Every case must be judged apart, and in regard to every case there will be room for a difference of judg ment. In the ethical sense, Sir William Cecil may not realize our loftiest idea of the statesman ; but among all the men about her, Elizabeth could not have fixed upon another combining in himself so great a measure of wise intention and real ability.* Under the influence of Cecil, the queen retained the The names of fourteen persons who had been in office under Mary, and who were all accounted Bomanists. But to these eight new names were added, and it was ob served that these names were all the names of per sons known to be Brotestants. Among these persons, the man next in importance to Cecil himself was Sir Nicolas Bacon, brother-in-law to Cecil, and father to the future lord Bacon. Bacon was made lord privy seals In a council with so large a number inclined to the medi\u00e6val faith, Brotestantism might seem to be at a great disadvantage. But the new men had the confidence of the queen, and her known disposition, * Tytler's Edward and Mary, i. 71-74, 237-245,316, 317 ; ii. 24-74, 102, no, 172-205, 435-437. f Camden, 369. 11 2"], [506, "484 ANGLICANS AND ROMANISTS. book ix. and the known feeling of the country, sufficed to turn chap_i. the scale in their favour. ]>eace con- Elizabeth succeeded to a war with France and Scot- FrlteTnli land, and to a bankrupt exchequer. But the new scoaand. secretary of state adopted vigorous measures to strengthen the force at sea, and to place the country in a posture of defence. The hundred ships of war at the command of the government under Henry, had dwindled to forty under Mary. Measures were at the same time taken to bring about a peace, if to be ac- \u2022 complished by any honourable means. In little more than two months after Elizabeth's accession, a con- ference with this view was opened at Cambray, which ended in the settlement of the differences between this country and France, and peace with France of course included peace with Scotland. The French promised to restore Calais, but not until after eight more years of possession, and on condition that nothing should be done in the interval in violation of the treaty including that pledge. In this manner the people of England were to be prepared for the ultimate loss of their last possession in that country. It was of the first im portance that the English government should be left at liberty to deal with the weighty domestic questions which were about to arise. policy and In this home policy the great matter was the ex- of the go* pected change in religion.

Chaf ' To steer the vessel of the state through so dangerous a sea, caution and moderation will be indispensable on the part of the queen, of her ministers, and of the' parliament. What Mary did on her accession, to place the authority of the couutry in the hands of her friends, must be in a great measure done again. Function aries who cannot be trusted, must be displaced by men entitled to confidence ; and adequate provision must everywhere be made against the secret machina tions, or the open revolt, of the disaffected. We have no certain knowledge concerning the author of this paper, nor are we sure that it was ever submitted to the government. We only know that it presents the views substantially which any man competent to carry out the policy of Elizabeth must have entertained.* One of the earliest acts of the queen was to issue Release of injunctions to the magistrates, to discountenance the underthe spies and informers who had been so much encou- os raged by the late government in searching out per- Nov. zs. sons suspected of heresy. Great numbers in prison J*\u00b0' under such accusations were released, and went every where uttering the praises of her majesty. f Order was also given that the gospels and epistles, the Lord's prayer, the Apostles' creed, and the ten com mandments, should be read in English in the public Dec j 7. service. The English Litany was also to be used, and the priest was not to elevate the host in the mass. This order was to continue ' until consultation may ' be had by parliament, by her majesty, and her ' three estates of this realm, for the better conciliation ' and accord of such causes as at present are moved in ' matters and ceremonies of religion.' j It was felt to * Strype's Annals, ii. 392-398. t Ihid. i. 37, 55, 56.

The pas sions of not a few, both among Protestants and Ro manists, required to be laid under some restraint. The pulpit in those days was so powerful an instrument in affecting the public mind, that, as on the accession of Edward, and afterwards of Mary, it was now deemed expedient to prohibit all preaching for a season ; and to forbid all innovation on the existing order in the church service, until such matters should be changed or settled by competent authority. Nearly two months intervened between the queen's accession and her coronation. On that occasion Lon don was the scene of an outburst of splendid pageantry and popular enthusiasm, such as England had not witnessed since the return of Henry V. from Agin court. The young queen made a good use of the happy season. Her noble presence, and her elegant and genial manner, won all hearts. It was then that Elizabeth first brought those little devices into play, which cost her little, but which were to do so much towards securing her a high place in the affec tions of her people. At one point of her progress from the Tower towards Westminster, Old Time came forth from his cavern, leading his beautiful daughter, Truth, into the presence of the queen of England, and the offering which Time and Truth presented to her majesty, as the best at their disposal, was an English Bible. Elizabeth seized on the spirit of the incident, raised the book aloft in the sight of the people, kissed it, placed it on her bosom, and bid them all be sure that it would be to her not only a book to be care- repaired to her great closet with her nobles and ladies, as hath been accus tomed in such high feasts ; and she passing a bishop preparing himself to mass, all in the old form, she tarried there until the gospel was done ; and when all the people looked for her to have offered, according to the old fashion, she and her nobles returned again from the closet and the mass into her privy chamber, which was strange unto divers.'\u2014 Ellis's Letters, 2nd Series, ii. 26a."], [509, "THE ECCLESIASTICAL SETTLEMENT. 487 fully kept, but to be diligently read. She had her bookix, special notice for all the companies and all persons, as Chaf' '\u2022 she passed ; and the rich offerings of the wealthy, and the humblest expressions of affection from the poor, called forth alike her smiles, and with them words long to be remembered.* But the brightest day is rarely without a cloud, Elizabeth and the day of Elizabeth's coronation was to reveal in Mshops! a signal manner the difficulty with which her path would be beset. It disclosed the wide chasm which separated between the feeling of the English people and that of the English bishops. Of fourteen prelates hold ing office in the English church, one only could be in duced to be present at this great national ceremony. Oglethorpe, bishop of Carlisle, was that prelate, and from his hands Elizabeth received her crown. Whatever some of her modern enemies may insinuate, it was no secret that the queen was a Brotestant, and that it was her intention to rule as a Brotestant sovereign at the head of a Protestant church. The existing race of bishops consisted either of old men, who had changed so often as to feel ashamed at the thought of changing again ; or of younger men who had been chosen on account of their zealous medi\u00e6val tenden cies, and who were not disposed to change at all. All had been more or less parties to the late persecutions, and stood before the people as men stained with the blood of England's martyred saints. One of these dignitaries, White, bishop of Win- spirit of th Chester, preaching at the funeral of the late queen, \u2122el\u2122 gave strong expression to the malcontent feeling of his order. He not only indulged in high commendation of Mary and her government, but spoke in most of fensive terms of the reformers, and of the policy which had brought them into prominence under Edward. Early in the spring, the silence imposed on the pulpit was withdrawn, and then the inferior clergy, * Holinshed."], [510, "488 ANGLICANS AND ROMANISTS. BOOK IX. Chap. i. Geneial state of seeling. slipping from the leash, took up the same strain in many quarters.* The language of disaffection at this juncture was not confined to the pulpit, nor to the clergy. In the common talk of the discontented, great licence was assumed, such as the laws of that time had been con stituted to punish and suppress. The boast, so often hitherto made, that the Catholics were the majority, could now be made no longer. It was generally understood from this time, that the majority had gone to the other side, especially in the great cities aud the towns. But zeal is blind, and men possessed with it do not often see when they are defeated. Even those who saw that they had been losing ground rapidly at home, could hope for large help from abroad. The rumour was, that all the Catholic powers were about to join in solemn league for the suppression of the reformed faith. No one could doubt the zeal of Spain in that direction, and the feeling of France promised to keep pace with it. Mary queen of Scots had become the wife of the dauphin \u2014 and the evils which Henry VIII. and the duke of Somerset had seen as likely to result from such an alliance, were to follow. The heir to the French monarchy, in virtue of that marriage, had openly assumed the arms of England. They were ostentatiously used in the jousts at Paris, and the ushers of the court, as Mary passed to the chapel royal, were heard to cry, ' Give place to the ' queen of England.' Elizabeth was thus virtually declared a usurper. According to the notions of the papal party, questions concerning the validity or in validity of marriage, were not questions to be determined by any secular authority ; the clergy, and in the last resort, the supreme pontiff, were the only competent and legitimate judges in relation to such cases. But Clement VII. and Baul III. had declared the marriage between Henry and Anne to have been * Strype, Annals, i. 60-62 ."], [511, "489 THE ECCLESIASTICAL SETTLEMENT. no marriage, and had pronounced Elizabeth a bastard, book ix. It was not to be supposed that such a sentence, once Chaf' '' published, could be easily revoked. The existing pontiff had assured the English ambassador that the case so stood, and could not stand otherwise. Had Elizabeth accepted the hand of Bhilip, his holiness would have been placed in some difficulty. Certainly, in the judgment of all sound Bomanists, Mary queen of Scots, and not Elizabeth, should have been raised to the English throne. Hence the name of this second Mary was heard everywhere on the lips of those who were opposed to Brotertantism. The reign of Edward had been short, why should that of Eliza beth be long ? The old faith, though utterly proscribed, had come back once, why should it not come back again ? In that age, belief in a itchcraft, in astrology, and in pretended prophecies, was so prevalent, that the body of the nation may be said to have been influenced by it. And those who were plc^so -1 with evil prophe cies had no great difficulty in finding them. According to some of these, the reign of the queen was not to extend to a second year. Even the noncon forming prelates, who had seen one Brotestant ascendancy come to an end, were willing to believe that a second, if permitted to come, might prove equalty unstable. What the reign of Elizabeth was to be, is to us matter of history, but to her contemporaries, in the early years of her sovereignty, the prospect possessed no such certainty. Elizabeth's first parliament sat ten weeks. Of the a pariia forty bills passed during that interval, the greater part jan. zi. related to manufactures and trade ; but several, as will May 8' be supposed, had respect to ecclesiastical affairs, and these involved changes of the highest importance. In prospect of such discussions, five Brotestant peers had been added to the upper house; and the electors, without much influence on the part of the government, returned a majority of persons who were of that faith. Sir Nicolas Bacon addressed the two houses in behalf"], [512, "490 ANGLICANS AND ROMANISTS. BOOK IX, Chap. i. of the crown, in a long discourse. He stated that the subjects demanding attention came under three heads \u2014 religion, domestic affairs, and foreign policy and finance. In settling religious matters, it became the wisdom of parliament to guard against ' idolatry and ' superstition ' on the one hand, and against anything like irreligion, or a want of reverence for sacred things, on the other. To this end, he observed, it would be well that speakers should avoid the use of all ' oppro ' brious words,' such as ' heretic, schismatic, or papist.' The queen, he assured them, like the good kings among God's ancient people, was intent on doing the will of God, that so his favour might rest on herself and on the nation.* An act recognising the queen's right to the throne was readily passed. But the bill to restore ecclesias tical supremacy to the crown, which was brought into the upper house on the following day, was strenuously opposed by Lord Montague, and by several of the bi shops. The speech delivered by Heath, archbishop of York, on this occasion, sets forth the objections felt by English Catholics on this point \u2014 such as were then urged, and continued to be urged, in the common homes and talk of the times. The supremacy pro posed to be given by this bill, he observed, was a spiritual supremacy, and it became their lordships to look carefully to what was involved in it. Baul IV. had shown himself ' a stern father ' to this country, and severance from his person might be a small matter. But severance from the papacy was severance from the great councils of the ancient church, and from her whole system of canonical law. It was to take the sovereignty of England out of all common ecclesias tical relationship with the sovereignties of Catholic Christendom, and was, in fact, ' to leap out of ' St. Beter's ship, hazarding ourselves to be over ' whelmed and drowned in the waters of schism, sects, \u2022 D'Ewes's Journal."], [513, "THE ECCLESIASTICAL SETTLEMENT. 491 ' and divisions.' This spiritual supremacy, he insisted, bookix. if things were to be called by their right names, was Chaf' '\" really a priestly supremacy, and the intention of this bill was to confer that function on the sovereign, who would always belong to the laity, and, in this instance, to make the case more unnatural still, the sovereign was a woman. It pertains to the priest to administer the sacraments, to absolve from sin, to feed the flock as a teacher ; and does it pertain to the layman, or, if we may say it, to the lay woman, to be thus employed? Has not Paul said that he did not suffer a woman even to speak in the church ? It was not an easy thing for an Anglican to meet some of these objections on his own principles. But he had adopted the rough idea, that ruling in the church was not meant to be exclusively a priestly function ; that, in fact, to rule pertains of right to the laity even more than to the priesthood ; and that the function of the priest should not be legislative in any case without the concurrence of the secular power. Hence, in the act of supremacy, the laity were to be understood as consenting to vest their ruling power in the parliament, and, ultimately, in the crown. It was this idea that carried this memorable bill, in the face of all the ingenious exceptions which the dissentient prelates could urge against it.* The next field-day in the history of this parliament Debate^con was on the bill which proposed to set forth the Book liturg/. of Common Brayer as used in the time of Edward, as the book to be used, with some modification, in * Strype, ii. 399-423. The 37th article of religion as revised in 1562, was intended to meet a portion of the above reasoning. 'Where we attribute to the queen's majesty the chief government, by which title we understand the minds of some slanderous folks to be offended : we give not to our princes the ministering either of God's word or of the sacra ments : but that only prerogative which we see to have been given always to all godly princes in holy Scripture by God himself, that is, that they should rule all estates and degrees committed to their charge by God, whether they be ecclesiastical or temporal, and restrain with the civil sword the stubborn and evil-doers.'"], [514, "492 ANGLICANS AND ROMANISTS. BOOK IX, Chap. i. all churches. This bill was opposed in elaborate speeches by Scot, bishop of Chester, and by Dr. Feckenham, lord abbot of Westminster \u2014 the last ecclesiastic of his rank whose voice was to be heard in an English parliament. The speakers affirmed that the religion which the bill would reject, was the oldest religion, professed among us from the beginning of our history ; the religion which stood alone in the unity of its faith and order ; the religion professed the most widely, and therefore entitled to the name of catholic ; and the religion which conduced most to good order in affairs of church and state. Barliaments might consist of wise and useful bodies of men, but their authority was the authority of laymen, and such assemblies passed beyond their province when attempt ing to legislate on matters pertaining to religion. The most was of course made of the differences which had grown up between Protestants both in Germany and in this countiy ; and their lordships were warned against a course of proceeding which promised to expose everything sacred to profanation, and to bring the good order of the state under the late queen into confusion.* Protestants did not find it difficult to reply to this reasoning. They maintained, that the religion pro fessed in this country from the beginning had not been the religion which was enforced by such terrible penalties in the last reign. The unity of faith claimed by the church of Bome they treated as a huge fiction, her doctrines having been manifestly the growth of time, so much so, that Brotestants did not differ so widely from each other, as the modern Catholic dif fered from the ancient. It was true, it had so hap pened, from the course of events, that for some time the majority of professed Christians had been professed Bomanists ; but if religion was to be determined by numbers, the majority of votes would be on the side * Strype, ii. 399-450."], [515, "THE ECCLESIASTICAL SETTLEMENT. 493 BOOK IX. Chap. i. of paganism. Brotestants, indeed, did not at once see their way to truth, nor can that seem strange when it is remembered how long they had been forbidden all exercise of independent thought. If some measure of spiritual disorder may be said to be incident to liberty, spiritual death is the sure result where there is no liberty. Nor is it to be tolerated, it was said, that the clergy should assume such an attitude towards the civil power. The bishops claim to arrest, examine, and imprison people at their pleasure, on religious grounds. To them it pertains to determine all matters concerning religious faith, order, and worship. To the magistrate they look to secure them in such free dom, to accept of such decisions at their hands, and then to stand prepared, as their lordships may desire, to inflict civil penalties on religious error. In this servile capacity \u2014 the capacity of constable and execu tioner \u2014 the lay power may come into action, but in no other form. Gallio, said the bishop of Chester, de clared himself a civil judge, and as such would take no cognisance of religious causes, an example worthy of imitation. But the reply was obvious. Gallio did exercise his function when the quarrel of the dis putants passed from words to blows, and his inter ference then, was not to take sides, but to punish the strikers, as men who breed uproars. Would Gallio have been a. magistrate to the mind of our bishops under the late queen ? Such, in substance, was the conflict of opinion going on at this time, both in parliament and through the country. The cardinal error of all the parties at issue consisted in their distrust of the power of truth, and in their tendency to look to the civil sword as its most effectual guardian. But the men who claimed that the bearer of that sword should act as an intelligent a^ent, and not as a passive instrument, were the men moving in the right direction. The Book of Common Brayer as presented to parlia ment, had been revised by a committee, consisting of"], [516, "494 ' ANGLICANS AND ROMANISTS. BOOK IX Chap. i. The Prayer book ap- proved by Parliament, The Arti cles. Penalties of the Act of Supremacy. divines, and members of the council. It had been prepared from a comparison of the first and second books set forth under Edward. Guest, afterwards bishop of Bochester, appears to have been the person most responsible for this revision. But both Cecil and the queen made their suggestions in relation to it. Not to give unnecessary offence to the feeling of the Catholic, two references to the bishop of Bome were omitted. The elements of the communion might be taken from the hands of the priest either kneeling or standing. The book did not differ in any material matter from the second book as revised by Cranmer. In the communion service, its language was derived in part from the book of 1553, and in part from that of 1549 ; and if somewhat obscure in its meaning as thus altered, it was explicit enough as opposed to the doctrine of tran substantiation. Nine bishops, and the same number of temporal peers, voted against this book. But when published, of the 9400 clergymen then in England, 189 only, of all ranks, became non conformists, relinquishing their preferments.* The revision of the Articles did not take place before 1562. Of the forty-two of which the series con sisted, as left by Cranmer, the last four were now omitted, and one on the procession and divinity of the Holy Ghost was inserted. The alterations made, as in the case of the liturgy, were not considerable, but were such as to show a tendency to recede somewhat from the advanced ground taken towards the close of Edward's time, rather than to go beyond it.f The oath of supremacy became a test act. All ecclesiastical persons, from the highest to the lowest, all persons taking degrees in the universities, or hold ing any civil office, or any beneficial relation to the government requiring homage to the crown, were re quired to bind themselves according to this instru ment. And all persons who should by word or deed * Strype, Ann. i. 104-124. f Burnet, iv. No. 55."], [517, "495 THE ECCLESIASTICAL SETTLEMENT.

By a second offence, his preferment was wholly for feited; and a third subjected him to imprisonment for life. The punishment of a layman offending against this act, was, in the first instance, imprisonment during one year ; imprisonment during life in the second instance ; and the penalty of the third offence was imprisonment with the loss of land and goods. It was further enacted, that all persons failing to attend their parish church, or some recognised place - of worship on the Lord's day, should pay the fine of one shilling for each absence, unless reasonable cause for such absence could be shown, f In the general discipline of the church, what should court of be accounted ' error, heresy, or schism,' was left to be mission?\"11\" decided by certain commissioners, to be appointed under the great seal of England, who were not how ever to judge anything as heresy which had not been so determined ' by the authority of the canonical ' scriptures, or by the first four general councils, or ' any of them, or by any other general council, wherein 1 the same was declared heresy by the express and ' plain words of scripture, or such as shall hereafter be ' ordered, judged, or determined to be heresy by the ' high court of parliament, with the assent of the ' clergy in their convocation.'!

But the tenths \u2014 a tenth of the yearly value as a permanent payment \u2014 was to be demanded without limitation.* By these measures, Bomanists were excluded from all places of trust. Their worship, even the private mass, was prohibited. They were subject to fines if they did not. conform to the religious observance re cognised by the state ; and to heavy penalties if they should attempt, either by word or writing, to dispa rage those services. The case of the puritans was hardly less a case of hardship. The men constituting the Court of High Commission might bind them to anything which they should themselves account as sanctioned by parliament, by a general council, or by the canonical scriptures. Good men might well rejoice in the change which had taken place, but in these stringent laws it is easy to discern the seeds of future trouble. From this point in our history we lose sight of our old friends the Nationalists. All idea of a church which should be severed from Catholic Christendom in polity, and be one with it in doctrine, has come to an end. The Anglo-Catholic party may be said to have died out. Attempts will be made hereafter to revive it, but they will be failures. Transubstantiation is finally rejected; the theory of the seven sacraments is a speculation of the past ; the clergy may marry ; confession is left optional ; the theology settled in the English church is a theology derived in part from Augustine, much more from Luther and Melancthon ; and the civil power is made to be supreme in all things over the ecclesiastical.

The Angl cans. the medi\u00e6val time is retained concerning priestly abso lution and the effect of water-baptism ; but obscure expressions in the Prayer-book must give place to clear expressions in the Articles. Nationalists under Henry VIII. plot with Bomanists in the hope of crushing English Brotestantism. But under Edward Brotestantism shows itself stronger than both, and after an interval of reaction, it gives these new signs of strength under Elizabeth. While cruel men were perpetrating their deeds of blood, and while selfish men were busy in their scrambles for gain, men of firm religious conviction braved the loss of all things in sowing the good seed, which, in its season, was to bring this large return. The cells into which bishops thrust their victims, and the flames which the hands of our native inquisitors kindled, were to be great helpers towards this consummation. And now, the nationality of Englishmen is consolidated. Their pa triotism and loyalty are no longer to be disturbed by the pretensions of any rival power. They acknowledge no authority on earth beyond the four seas by which their own island home is girded. This is a great revolu tion. It is far from being faultless, and is to retain its footing with difficulty for some while to come ; but, in the main, it is to last. It was as influenced by this more Brotestant feeling, along with the desire of national independence, that the Anglicans, with whom we shall now have to do, are distinguished from the Nationalists. They are not merely politicians, they are men with religious pre ferences. They do not content themselves with reject ing the pretensions of the papacy, nor with imposing wholesome restraint on the jurisdiction and power of the national clergy. They have religious beliefs which are substantially Brotestant. They have chosen their course because they think it both right and Christian. In their view, the clergy do not constitute the church, and a prosperous hierarchy may be something quite distinct from a prosperous religion. They have learnt II K K"], [520, "498 ANGLICANS AND ROMANISTS. BOOK IX, Chap. i. to regard the people, the ' congregation of faithful men, as the church, and to account the church as pro sperous only as the people are instructed and devout. It is not in their manner, nor in the manner of the queen, to encourage priestly airs among churchmen. Sacred persons and sacred things must be treated with reverence ; but modesty, moderation, and sub mission, are assumed to be the virtues proper to men sustaining the sacred office. Any man disposed to indulge in the talk of a Becket, a Bole, or a Laud, will find the court of Elizabeth a most ungenial place. Its weighty common sense precludes even the ap pearance of such follies. The men we describe as Anglicans not only avowed themselves Brotestants, but accounted themselves the natural allies of Bro testants everywhere, and were prepared to hazard much in defence of the creed and principles supposed to be comprehended under that name. In this respect, the men about Elizabeth stand far in advance of the men who were about her father; and they evince a consistency, integrity, and stability of character which were too often wanting among the . statesmen who acted in the name of her brother. Every year, the domestic affairs and foreign relations of the country are to expand, to become more complex and more diffi cult. But the new men are to prove equal to the new exigencies. The kingdom is to grow, and these men are to grow with it. The Cecils, the Bacons, and the Walsinghams of that age were statesmen of their own order. It was hardly possible that men of such a mould should have become chiefs in our history at an earlier period. They were the growth of time, and they came in their season. Grave men they were, and they knew the times to be grave, and they lived to grave ends. Nor should it be forgotten, that these elements of character in the ministers of that time had their place largely in the queen."], [521, "CHABTEB II. COERCION AND CONSPIRACY. I^HE measures which excluded the papal authority B\u00b0\u00b0^ lf- \u25a0 from this country would not fail to call forth the - enmity of that power : and the English government and the had to calculate on meeting with hostile influences PaPa\u00b0y from that source, in all the channels through which such influence might be extended. No monarch could propitiate the papal court more certainly, than by showing himself a foe to the sovereign, who had not only presumed to adopt the schism of her father, but had allied it with heresies of her own. To impose a check on the Grand Turk would have been a small service, compared with the virtue of inflicting some signal chastisement on such a delinquent. If Catholic Christendom could be armed against Elizabeth, so armed it would be. With such feeling abroad, the ministers of the The d.e' . t-i -i s\u00bbT i\u00ab pnved and- English queen had to reckon on finding their path conformirg' beset by many signs of discontent at home. The c ergy' bishops, with one exception only, had declared them selves opposed to the proceedings of parliament in relation to the English church, and the only course left to the government, was to raise other men to their place. Some of these Bomanist prelates, such as Heath, archbishop of York, and Tonstal, bishop of Durham, were estimable men. But the majority, bearing in mind what their own conduct had been under Mary, had no right to complain of harsh treatment. By no one of them was the complaint of injury raised so openly as by Edmund Bonner, late bishop of London.* * Bonner was committed to the Marshalsea, but suffered nothing from waut, hunger, or cold.

Of the somewhat less than two hundred ecclesiastics who surrendered their preferments, the majority con sisted of men above the rank of the parochial clergy. Not more than eighty parishes in all England were left without ministers. But a large proportion of those who subscribed to the terms of the government did so under reservation. These persons had persuaded them selves that such a policy might be justified, inasmuch as it allowed them to retain influence they would otherwise lose, and saved their pulpits from passing into the hands of men whose doctrine would be poison to the souls of the people. The existence of this mass of concealed disaffection was no secret to the ministers of the queen. The causes, moreover, which had trans ferred authority and power, in this manner, to new hands among the clergy, led to similar results among the laity. While the relations between England and the see of Bome were such, the loyalty of the English Bomanists was sure to be more or less suspected. They were excluded from the service of their country, and to account men as untrustworthy, is commonly to make them so.* News of the changes taking place in England soon became familiar to all the courts of Europe.

This was the severest treatment to which a deprived bishop was subjected.

A man named Story, an old agent of Bonner in his worst deeds, had a seat in Elizabeth's first parliament, and was insolent enough to tell the house of commons, that much as he had done to bring heretics to punishment during the last reign, his only regret was that he had not done much more. \u2014 Ibid. ii. 115.

But some genera tions were to pass away before England was to become thus wise. Elizabeth replied, that to permit separate places of worship was not consistent with her honour or conscience, nor with the safety of her government ; that to the better portion of her subjects such a proceeding would be intolerable ; that the deprived prelates, in whose behalf this plea was chiefly urged, had most of them conformed in the time of her father, or of her late brother, to everything now exacted from them ; that some of them had so behaved themselves towards her, as to be little entitled to favour at her hands ; that she would, nevertheless, be mindful of those who had acquitted themselves more discreetly and dutifully ; that it was her intention to exer cise a considerate forbearance towards the religious scruples of such persons ; and that she felt bound, in defence of herself and her people, to declare, that the faith and order established by the solemn acts of her parliament, were not capricious novelties, as some men were pleased to affirm, but matters which could be vindicated by an appeal to the history of the church in her earliest and purest times \u2014 the novelties were on the other side.* Elizabeth's first parliament was dissolved in the F\u00b0\u2122s\u00ab .-.,,.-. ,. aflairs. spring of 1559, her second was not assembled until the opening of 1562.

The political ties which had so long bound that kingdom to France, were fast giving place to those religious ties which were to bind it for the future to England. The Protestants of Scotland and of France began to look to this country for influence and assistance, and the most influential persons in the government of Elizabeth were disposed to encourage them in so doing. So England began to take her place in a great Protestant confederacy, which was to hold its ground, amidst many alternations of disaster and success, during the next half-century. imus iv. In this interval, also, Paul IV. had died, and the E\"z!beth. pontiff who succeeded him was disposed to pursue a Mis5o,s* more considerate course towards this country. His Holiness sent to ' our most beloved daughter in Christ, ' greeting, and apostolic benediction,' deputing an eminent ecclesiastic to express his affectionate solicitude for the welfare of herself and her kingdom, and to confer with her on the posture of her affairs. It was believed at the time, that Pius IV. was prepared to withdraw the objection of the papal see to the mar- riage between Henry and Anne Boleyn ; to grant the use of an English liturgy \u2022 and to allow communion in both kinds. But these concessions, considerable as they seem, would have left the doctrine and temper of the hierarchy all that they had been under Mary. The queen was further invited to send representatives to the council of Trent. But Elizabeth had taken her position. The papal envoy was in Flanders, and was informed that he could not be received at the English court. Concerning the council of Trent, the queen declared herself favourable to the meeting of a general council, but, in her judgment, it pertained to the sovereigns of Christendom, and especially to the emperor, to convene such assemblies ; in the bishop of Bome she could recognise no authority that might not be claimed by any other prelate.

The penalty for refus ing, was, in the first instance, that of premunire. By a second refusal, the penalty incurred was that of high treason. But offence against this statute was not to entail corruption of blood, nor were those condemned on the premunire statute to be placed in all respects beyond the protection of law.

It was stated in the preamble to this act, that the conduct of the persons who would fain uphold the bishop of Bome in his usurped 'jurisdiction and power,' had amounted to ' marvellous outrage and licentious ' boldness,' and called loudly for more ' sharp restraint ' and correction.' But in a speech made by lord Montague, in the upper house ; and in another by Mr. Atkinson, an able lawyer, in the commons, it was affirmed as notorious, that the catholics had furnished no cause for this greater severity of proceeding against them, but had conducted themselves, since the queen's accession, with remarkable quietness and loyalty. We know, however, that Bhilip, since Elizabeth had declined his proposal of marriage, had become cool.* We know also, that before this act was passed, the duke of Guise and the cardinal of Lorraine had been plotting to give their niece, the queen of Scots, in marriage to the king of Navarre, and to raise her to the English throne. Two Englishmen, Arthur Bole and Sir Anthony Fortescue, were attainted as having been parties to this conspiracy.! Such schemes always involved communication with sjmipathizers in this country. We know not what had come to the knowledge of the government ; but there had been light and shadow in the foreign relations of England during the last five years, and it had been seen that men pledged to be faithful to a foreign power, are sometimes in danger of looking upon the misfortunes of their country with feelings scarcely proper to the good subject. * He had returned the order of the Garter ; and his minister, count de Feria, had presumed to send a servant in the household of the English ambassador to the Inquisition \u2014 Camden, 383, 384. t Pole and Fortescue said that they did not intend to carry this scheme into effect during the lifetime of Elizabeth. But this was because it had been prophesied that she would die within a year, and they believed the prophecy. _ ' They were pardoned, for the sake of that royal blood that was in their veins.' \u2014 Camden, 389."], [527, "505 COERCION AND CONSPIRACY. Nothing had happened, however, to justify such a book ix. course of legislation. It was a recurrence to the cruel i-^1' error of the monarch in whose favour the act of supre macy had been devised. It was not deemed enough that the Bomanist should pledge himself to loyalty of conduct. He was required to say, on oath, that he renounced his speculative opinion touching the supre macy of the pontiff, in any sense whatever \u2014 an act to which no sincere Catholic could descend without ac counting himself perjured and impious. The words of the act are ' that no prince or prelate hath, or ' ought to have, any jurisdiction or authority within ' this realm.' To say to the Catholic, you must swear thus, or suffer the penalties of treason, was not only absurd, it was signally cruel. ' Understanding,' said lord Montague, ' may be persuaded, but cannot be ' forced.' ' Beligion,' said Mr. Atkinson, ' must sink ' in by persuasion ; it cannot be pressed in by violence.' Noble language \u2014 it is sad that men in possession of power should have been so slow to admit its weighty rectitude and wisdom. Bersons holding forbidden opinions do not cease to hold them because made to swear the contrary. Such laws may make hypocrites \u2014 they do not make converts.* The temper of these enactments might lead us to Elizabeths regard the administration of Elizabeth, even in this tion not so early portion of her reign, as partaking of a merciless j^\"^.88 rigour. But it is certain that the queen, in common with her father, while concerned to possess the means of promptly reaching disaffection, was disposed to suspend the use of such large powers according to cir cumstances. This was not a policy to be commended, inasmuch as it tended to substitute personal inclina tion, not to say personal caprice, in the place of legal certainty. But our legislators who gave such severity to law in the sixteenth century, appear to have so done in the full expectation that it would be thus attempered in its administration. * Part. Hist. 686."], [528, "506 ANGLICANS AND ROMANISTS. book ix. It must not be supposed, however, that the laws Jm^' against Bomanism, in the first, or in this second par peTsTcutfon liament of Elizabeth, were a dead letter. We learn in the emiy from two of Elizabeth's bishops, Grindal of London, thisrdgn. and Cox of Ely, that not long after the queen's acces- sion, persons suspected of hearing mass in private were frequently put to trouble. The house of lady Carew had been entered on suspicion, but no discovery of the sort expected had been made. ' The cause,' say the prelates, ' is only this ; neither the priest, nor ' any of his auditors, not so much as the kitchen-maid, ' will receive any oath before us to answer to articles, ' but stoutly say they will not swear, and say also ' they will neither accuse themselves nor none other. ' This is grown now lately, as we find by examinations, 'to be a rule to all the scholars of that school.'* The bishops, we regret to say, suggest that if the priest they have found ' might be put to some kind of tor- ' ment,' confessions of a useful kind would probably be obtained. But so the proscribed priesthood could discipline their flocks even in such times ; and so per- secution had bound Bomanists together clown to the kitchen-maid. Beginning It should not be forgotten, however, that Elizabeth punishment had been nearly twenty years on the throne before grounds \u00b0us any Bomanist was sentenced to suffer capital punish under eh- nient on account of disaffection to the government. Through this long interval the penalties of noncon- formity were restricted to fines and imprisonment. During those twenty years, the great majority of the persons exposed to this harassing and irritating form of persecution avoided it, by becoming regular, or oc- casional conformists. It was not until the authorities to which the consciences of the English Catholics were subject had declared such conformity to be un lawful, that the laws which had suppressed the one form of worship, and enforced the other, became so greatly and generally grievous. Becusancy, as non- * H iynes, 395."], [529, "507 COERCION AND CONSPIRACY. conformity with the proscribed worship came to be bookix. designated, everywhere gave the intolerant churchman _j^f_^' or magistrate, and the mercenary informer, a clue to the homes of their victims, and a coarse and cruel use did they often make of their power. As usual, the weak endeavoured to counteract the power of the strong by almost any device available for that purpose. Their priests were disguised. Their forbidden ser vices were performed in secret chambers, and under the cover of the night. The necessity which made these practices familiar to them, and which was so costly in other ways, gave them a place, in their own estimation, with that true church which in past ages had been so often called to suffer for righteousness' sake. But it is not possible to judge fairly concerning the Romanism policy of Elizabeth towards Bomanism, without look- aiiyofaiw ing carefully to the relations in which she stood to the trari'P0Ker professors of that faith, abroad as well as at home. It is a notorious fact, that ecclesiastics adhering to the see of Bome, were never weary in endeavouring to persuade sovereigns that the reformed faith was not more adverse to the authority claimed by popes, than to that claimed by princes. Nor is it to be denied that the principles which are opposed to arbitrary power in one form, are likely to be found opposed to it in other forms. It is to the honour of Brotes tantism that such are the tendencies of its maxims. Nothing was more natural, accordingly, than that sovereigns disposed to rule very much according to their pleasure, should be inclined to avail themselves of the large assistance which the papal priesthood might be expected to render in support of such a policy.

But certain as this truth may be, princes Chap' *' have rarely seemed to understand it. Their manner has been to look to an immediate supply of men and money for the prosecution of immediate objects, and to leave projects aiming at anything more remote and complex to dreamers. Ordinarily, kings account them- selves great, in the measure in which they are at liberty to be despotic. It has not been often given to monarchs to see, that to divide power with their sub- jects, is not to exist in diminished strength, but to receive their own aoain as with usurv. The Catholic O xl sovereigns of Europe in the time of Elizabeth, seem to have been firm believers in the doctrine of their priests concerning the relation between Brotestantism and anarchy. Brotestantism, it was said, under the plea of religion, has its natural issue in the destruc- tion of all religion, and in the disorganization of society. It was made to be to the good Catholics of those times, very much what French republicanism was to our fathers towards the close of the last cen- tury. Hence the policy of combining to put down heresy, was felt by Catholic princes to be their common duty and interest. continental So far back as 1533, we find Francis I. committing Sin -u* himself to an enterprise of this nature with the most Francis i. unscrupulous severity. His hope was to see, as the result of his schemes, ' the iniquities, and the damna- ' ble sects and heresies of Luther and others, extirpated ' and rooted out.'* This was the language of Francis to Clement VII., who at once issued his bulls enjoin- ing that all Lutherans refusing to abjure should be ' excommunicated, anathematized, and cut off'.'f The marriage of the son of Francis with the niece of Clement \u2014 the Catherine de Medici of French history \u2014 was the event which was accepted as the confirma- tion of this guilty compact. Nor was this compact a * Lett, di Principi,\\. 23. f ' abscindi decreverimus,' Legrand, v. 571 et seq."], [531, "509 COERCION AND CONSPIRACY. BOOK IX Chap. z.

The religious people dwelling in Merindol, in Frovence, were crushed and destroyed as such in the very manner which the savage language of the prince and the pontiff had foreshadowed. In the district of Cabrieres, twenty villages were destroyed. Even Catholic autho rities admit, that in this persecution, not less than three thousand persons were destroyed, many being put to death with studied barbarity, besides some hundreds who were sent to the galleys.* Calvin, in his memorable address to Francis, says, ' Our accusers, ' 0 sovereign, tell you that this new gospel aims at ' nothing better than to give licence to the traitorous ' and the vicious ; that our great intention is to over ' throw kingdoms \u2014 we, whose voice is never heard ' among the factious.'! This language points to the true source of these atrocities. Francis was not governed by any religious motive in originating such deeds. His object was wholly political and selfish. Well might his last hours be dark and foreboding.'! Henry II. adopted the intolerant policy of his father, and hoped to complete the work which Francis had left but partially accomplished. The Brotestants of France included princes of the blood, and many persons of high rank. Edicts were nevertheless issued ' forbidding private assemblies on pain of death ' \u2014 for Brotestants were wont to meet in private houses ' in the night to practise their worship \u2014 and by these ' edicts half the confiscations were made to the in ' former.' \u00a7 Death was the penalty to be inflicted on every Brotestant refusing to abjure.

Henry flattered himself that he should be able to subdue heresy at home, and that he should live to see it vanquished once more in England. The swords of France and Scotland were supposed to be powerful enough, if rightly wielded, to raise Mary into the place of Elizabeth. By indulging this vain dream, Henry laid the foundation of that rivalry and jealousy between Elizabeth and Mary which was to last so long, and to end so tragically. Elizabeth was prompt in demanding an explanation of what had been done by the queen of Scots and her husband. It was said in reply, that the queen of England carried the arms of France, and that this use of the arms of England by the queen of Scotland, could not, accordingly, be any just ground of offence. But every one knew that the two cases were not parallel. The arms of France had been borne by twelve English sovereigns, and though retained by Elizabeth, the usage had become, as all men felt, a piece of harmless pedantry. When the arms of France were first taken up by our English kings, it was pre paratory to an attempt to seize the French crown.

The question was bookix, natural, but the Guises, and the Italian school of CHAr\" *' politicians which had now become rooted in France, had no satisfactory answer to retuim to it. It was while discussions on this subject were pending, and while the English ambassador in Baris was invited to tables served with plate on which this understood insult to his country was emblazoned, that the French govern ment sent military aid into Scotland to curb the zeal of the Beformers.* The queen-regent of Scotland had sprung from the Elizabeth stock of the Guises, and was an adept in the art and scotsthe dissimulation which seems to have been hereditary in that family. Her brothers, the princes of Lorraine, were men of large and determined ambition, and were bent on the suppression of reform in Scotland, pre paratory to the exclusion of a bastard from the throne of England, and of heresy from the English church. With the knowledge of these intentions, nothing could be more manifest than the duty of Elizabeth to aid the Scottish Beformers to the extent of her power, f While Mary was inflicting her cruelties on the English Brotestants, Knox had raised his memorable Blast against the Regiment of Women, and had thus placed himself in an unfortunate position towards the successor of that princess. Elizabeth felt that the doctrine which proscribed female sovereignty alto gether, proscribed her own. But Knox softened his Blast, and Elizabeth, after some while, softened her resentment, much to the advantage of both countries. * Camden, 378, 379. f Cecil, writing on this aspect of affairs, says, ' It is agreeable to God's law for every prince and public state to defend itself, not only from present peril, but from peril that may be feared to come. It is manifest that France cannot any way so readily, so puissantly offend, yea, invade and put the crown of England in danger, as if they recover an absolute authority over Scotland. The long deep-rooted hatred of the house of Guise, which now occupieth the king's authority, against England, is well known.' \u2014 Forbes, State Papers."], [534, "512 ANGLICANS AND ROMANISTS. BOOK IX Chap. z. Progress of the Refor mation in Scotland. In little more than six months after the accession of Elizabeth, Knox put himself in communication with authorities south of the Tweed, in the hope of obtain ing assistance from the English government. By that time, the insincerity and bad faith of the queen regent had become so known, that no pledge she might be disposed to make could be received with any measure of confidence. While there were political reasons on the side of such a policy, the queen had been tolerant, and even courteous, towards the Bro testants. But when the time for acting in accordance with her inclination had come, she did not hesitate to tell two of the reform nobles, that in spite of anything they might do, their preachers should all be banished from Scotland. On being reminded of the inconsistency of such a threat with her recent promises, she an swered, with the pride and effrontery characteristic of her house, that ' it became not subjects to burden their ' princes with promises further than they pleased to ' keep them.'* But, by the time the first parliament under Elizabeth had restored the Brotestantism of the English church, the Scotch reformers, under the leader ship of certain lords, called the Lords of the Congre gation, had succeeded in introducing the reformed worship in many of the towns and districts of Scot land ; and had appeared in arms, prepared to vindicate their proceedings by the sword. The populace, in many places, had demolished images and pictures, and had rased monasteries to the ground. And had the struggle been simply a struggle between Scotchmen, the reformers might have decided and settled their affairs without foreign help. But five-sixths of the men in arms against them were disciplined French soldiers, and no one could say to what extent rein forcement of that kind might be sent to the aid of their Bomanist countrymen. During the spring of 1559, Elizabeth was occupied * Esnox's Hist. 126."], [535, "COERCION AND CONSPIRACY. 513 in negotiating a peace with France, and to the close bookix. of that year she hesitated to declare herself openly on CHAP' *' the side of the Scottish reformers. The members of the council, who, from their Bomanist sympathies, were called Bhilippians, were desirous that nothing should be done, or that a secret supply of money should be the utmost assistance rendered. The queen was influenced considerably by that party, still more by her old feeling of dislike to Knox, and by reports concerning the violent proceedings of his followers, but most of all by a wish not to displease Bhilip, nor to furnish any new ground of complaint to France.* Not until the Lords of the Congregation had proceeded to the length of suspending the queen-regent from her function ; had failed in an assault upon Leith, and in an encounter with the French soldiers ; and had retreated from Edinburgh to Stirling with diminished numbers, and almost in despair \u2014 not till then did Elizabeth enter into formal treaty with the Bro- testants of Scotland.

BOOK IX Chap. z. August Mary in Scotland, that treaty, was the entire withdrawment of the French. Amidst these exciting scenes the queen regent died. The Scottish parliament was speedily assembled, free to deliberate on the rebgion of the future. The reformed faith was known to have become the faith of the great majority, both among men of rank and among the people. Everywhere the medi\u00e6val worship, which had almost ceased to be visible, was prohibited, and a worship of the simple character which still obtains in that country was introduced and established. In Scottish history, the fall of French influence and of the Catholic religion came together. The changes in England may be said to have called forth the desire of change in Scotland, and the assistance of England realized the object of the desire so awakened. England will not be at peace with the states of the continent -in the future any more than in the past, but Scotland will no longer be a gate always thrown open to her enemies. A policy of that nature on the part of the Scots had seemed to them to be dictated by the law of self-pre servation. But in the time to come, the best interests of Scotland will be felt to be identified with the best interests of England. The next move in the affairs of that country brought Mary queen of Scots into a nearer and a more incon- venient relation to Elizabeth. On the death of her husband, Francis II., Mary ceased to be queen of France ; and, as is well known, she soon afterwards began to assume her functions as queen of Scotland. To the Catholicism she had imbibed in France, Scottish Brotestantism was especially repugnant. Differences between herself and her subjects concerning religion were ceaseless and bitter. Her marriage to lord Darnley added to her troubles ; and the murder of that nobleman, the deed of the man who became her next husband, and in which, according to common rumour, she was herself implicated, exhausted the forbearance of the nation, made her a prisoner in"], [537, "515 COERCION AND CONSPIRACY. Scotland, and ended in her flight from that country bookix into England.* CnAP*' Bulers who have been deeply censured when in the \"'Tana height of their sway, have often become objects of sympathy, and of a new feeling of loyalty, when divested of the signs of their former greatness, and no longer powerful. The queen of Scots, just escaped from her prison on Locrdeven, criminal as she was supposed to have been, could draw many bold and generous hearts to her standard. And when that sudden burst of sunshine has passed away, and the same woman, a model in beauty and attraction, who had worn the crown of two kingdoms, rushes a scared and deserted fugitive into England, as her only chance of escape from a second prison, many hearts in which she had no place before, are moved with pity towards her. The fall of greatness is always affecting, especially when the fall is from the highest place. What to do with Mary queen of Scots was a perplexing question to the government of Elizabeth \u2014 the sagacity of that government was not to be tasked by one more difficult. During the recent changes in Scotland, Elizabeth, while continuing her friendly relations with the Bro testant party in that kingdom, had expressed herself as amazed, and deeply offended, by their temerity in presuming to depose and imprison one sovereign, and to raise another to the vacant throne. It was not thus that subjects should demean themselves, in any case, towards their princes. Elizabeth had also written to Mary in these circumstances with more cordiality and sympathy than at any former period. Mary could not hope to escape from her pursuers, and to reach the continent, without passing through Eng land. The recent communications of the queen no doubt disposed her to look with more confidence in this direction. Before taking this step, however, her * Collections relating to the History of Mary Queen of Scotland, by James Anderson. Mignet's Life of Mary Queen of Scots..

The case before the English govern meut. faithful follower, lord Herries, was instructed to write to the governor of Carlisle, to learn whether she might look with safety to that place as a refuge. The governor answered that lord Scroop, the warden of the borders, was at a distance, and that he could only promise for himself, that if the queen came to Carlisle, she should be received with the honour due to her rank, and that he would be responsible for her safety until the pleasure of the queen of England should be ascertained. But the country was full of excitement ; Mary could not wait for this answer, and hastening across the Solway, she placed herself unconditionally in the hands of the English queen.* Mary sent lord Herries at once to Elizabeth, pray ing that she might obtain admission to her presence, and that assistance might be granted her to inflict a fitting chastisement on her rebellious subjects. f The answer of the queen, given no doubt with the advice of her council, was, that she was very sorry not to be able to comply with those requests \u2014 that the murder of lord Darnley, and the queen's marriage with Both well, had subjected her to such imputations, that until the ground of those charges should be examined, she could neither render the assistance solicited, nor grant an interview. Mary thus found herself a captive, and saw there was no prospect of obtaining her liberty, except as the result of investigations which she naturally wished to avoid. Judging the case strictly, there was nothing in the maxims of municipal or international law to justify the conduct of the English government.' The ques tion is, were there not principles more ultimate than those defined in such maxims that might be adduced in support of such a course of proceeding ? May not self-defence become a duty in cases not anticipated by existing law, and for which no provision has in consequence been made ? Did the case of the queen of * Anderson's Collections, vol. iv. 1-29. t Ibid. iv. 29."], [539, "517 COERCION AND CONSPIRACY. BOOK IX, CnAr. z. Scots belong to this class of peculiar and extreme cases? To judge on this point we must look to the different courses that may be said to have been open to the cabinet of Elizabeth. Cecil looked at the question in this light. Would it be well, he asks, that Mary should be restored to Scotland, and that the government there should remain as at present ? Or would it be well that she should be restored to some joint exercise of sovereignty, but under cautious restrictions ? For England, the first would be the best, and the easiest ; the second would be the next best, but would be more difficult. But there remains this common fame that she has been a party to the murder of her husband, and the strongly suspicious circumstances out of which that fame has grown. On this point there must be investigation, and conclusion of some kind, before the English queen and the Eng lish nation can be parties to any new settlement of affairs in Scotland.* But why should England concern herself at all about any settlement ? Why not release the queen, and leave her to her own resources in her own cause ? This question, if it has any meaning, must mean that England should encourage the queen of Scots to go to France or Spain, and to do her best towards subduing her Protestant subjects, the next neighbours and steady allies of England, by the aid of the Guises, or of king Philip. Elizabeth, through years past, had been assuring the Protestants of Scotland that they might confide in her friendship. Would such a course towards that people have been consistent with such assurances ? Would not their voices have been raised in execration of it as perfidy, cruelty, and madness ? Further \u2014 Elizabeth had. allied herself with the cause of Protestantism over Europe ; and would it have been consistent with that policy to have allowed either of the great Catholic powers to have so established * Anderson, iv. 34\u201444."], [540, "518 ANGLICANS AND ROMANISTS. BOOK IX Chap. z. itself at her very door, knowing that the effect must be to make her powerless abroad, by exposing her to constant danger at home ? Scotland was of value in the estimation of the intolerant spirits who ruled in Paris and Madrid, purely because to possess a solid footing there would be to make England feeble else where ; and would be, moreover, in the event of Elizabeth's decease, to possess a vantage-ground, from which to assert the claims of a second Mary to the English throne, and to attempt a second restoration of Bomanism in the English church. The idea that this quarrel was a quarrel of mere jealousy between two vain women, is to the last degree childish. The writers who indulge in such fancies, have not the capacity to see the material of which society was then composed, or to comprehend the character either of Elizabeth or of Mary. Every step taken by Eliza beth in this grave business was taken by advice of her council ; and the ambition of Mary was large, mascu line, and determined. She was a woman, who, in one of her flights, clothed herself in male attire ; who in a season of danger could put herself at the head of her troops on horseback, with loaded pistols in her saddle ; and who could lament that it was not possible she should be a man, to take on the military gear, and scare her enemies from her path. In the moral sense, Mary was a weak woman, but in no other. She was beautiful, intelligent, insinuating, unscrupulous, cease less in her activity, and fast wedded to the supersti tions, and to the maxims of arbitrary power, in which she had been educated. Sir Francis Knollys, who was much with her soon after her coming to England, writes, ' This lady and princess is a notable woman. ' She seems to regard no ceremonious honour beside ' the acknowledging of her estate royal. She shows ' a disposition to speak much, to be bold, to be pleasant, ' and to be familiar. She shows a great desire to be ' avenged of her enemies. She shows a readiness to ' expose herself to all perils in hope of victory. She"], [541, "519 COERCION AND CONSPIRACY. desires much to hear of hardiness and valiancy, com- book ix. ' mending by name all approved hardy men of her CnAF' z' ' country, although they be her enemies ; and she con ' cealeth no cowardice even in her friends. The thing ' that most she thirsteth after is victory, and it seemeth ' to be indifferent to her to have her enemies diminished, ' either by the sword of her friends, or by the bberal ' promises or rewards of her purse, or by division and ' quarrels raised among themselves. So that for the sake ' of victory, pain and peril seem pleasant to her, and in ' respect of victory, health and all things seem to her ' contemptible and vile. Now, what is to be done with ' such a lady and princess, I refer to your judgment.'* Yes \u2014 that was the question, and Cecil insisted that The com no answer could be given to it, until the result of an \u2122 York\u2122 inquiry concerning the charges preferred against the Scottish queen should be ascertained. In the end, it was agreed that commissioners should be appointed to hear the case between Mary and her subjects, and to report upon it, The duke of Norfolk, the earl of Sussex, and Sir Balph Sadler, acted for Elizabeth ; the bishop of Boss, lord Herries, and others, acted for Mary ; and the case of the Scottish government as against the queen, was entrusted to the regent Murray, her half-brother, and others, including the names of Lethington and Buchanan. Mary's com missioners dwelt with much ability on the revolutionary proceedings of the popular party in Scotland, which had ended in the imprisonment of the queen, and in her flight into England. Murray and his friends assigned reasons in defence of what they had done. But they kept back their main charges \u2014 those affecting the moral conduct of the queen, and so long as that course was pursued, the issue was not such as Elizabeth was likely to account satisfactory. Murray submitted for awhile to this disadvantage. But at length he solicited protection from Ebzabeth, if he should * Anderson, iv. 71, 72. nth June, 1568."], [542, "520 ANGLICANS AND ROMANISTS. B,\u00b0?,Il Ix' proceed to state other and much graver reasons. He now laid before the English commissioners a series ot letters, which had passed between Mary and Bothwell, showing that the murder of Darnley, the divorce of Bothwell from his wife, and his marriage with the queen, were all parts of a joint scheme. Norfolk, who deeply lamented the appearance of such evidence, concurred with the other commissioners in stating, that the letters bore every appearance of being genuine, and that he did not see how such evidence was to be met. The contents of the letters were laid before the queen and the council. The earl of Lenox, too, father to the murdered Darnley, now came into the discussion, affh'ming his belief that Mary had been a party to that deed, and demanding vengeance. Norfolk said, that if these letters were made public, the accession of Mary to the English throne, under any circumstances, would be impossible. He knew also that Elizabeth was not disposed to settle anything concerning the succession, and he feared the consequences that might result from such a position of affairs. Mary'scom- It had been agreed, however, that the conference at maVe new York, which had settled nothing, should be succeeded wiUnnot8\u2014 by another at Hampton Court. But now, when these proceed, letters are produced, and the charges against the queen come to be charges of atrocious crime, the bishop of Boss and lord Herries decline meeting the accusations. They now say, that the queen of Scots must be ' allowed to justify herself in the presence of the ' queen of England, the whole nobility of the king- ' dom, and the ambassadors of foreign states.'* But it was to be remembered, that the ground on which this investigation should be conducted, had been settled by mutual agreement from the first ; that the inquiry in York had been conducted in accordance with that agreement ; and that the proposed meeting at Hampton Court had been assented to, with the tacit understanding that it was to be conducted after the * Anderson, iii. 31."], [543, "521 COERCION AND CONSPIRACY. same manner. The charges, indeed, had become more book ix serious, but the original mode of procedure was meant HAP *\u2022 to embrace all possible charges \u2014 the whole case, whatever it might include. The course taken by Mary's commissioners was the virtual confession of a bad cause. They must have known, that the new conditions now insisted upon were not likely to be granted \u2014 and had they been granted, it was hardly to be doubted, that means of evading any further scrutiny would have been discovered. So this memorable inquest came to an end, leaving little room to doubt concerning what the issue would have been had it been carried out on its broader basis. The circum stances which preceded and followed the murder of Darnley, are all in favour of the genuineness of these fearful letters.* Such was the condition to which the queen ofc\u00a3urse01 Scots was reduced in less than eighteen months after the comi the death of Darnley. And while events in Scotland papacy'.1\" during the last six years had been such as the reader Jn]y' l5SS has seen, the course of affairs on the continent was not less significant of the character of the age. The papacy was not to be reformed in the Protestant sense, but it had been undergoing a considerable reform after a manner of its own. Thoughtful men could not con ceal from themselves that the lives of the clergy, and * The commissioners writing to Elizabeth say,' The letters discourse of some things which were unknown to any other than herself and Bothwell, and as it is hard to .counterfeit so many, so the matter of them, and the manner in which these men came by them, are such that it seemeth that God, in whose sight murder is abominable, would not permit the same to be hid or concealed.' \u2014 Anderson, iv. part ii. 3 1 et seq. Haynes's State Papers, 465-493. When Mary took this final ground, it was very naturally said to the Scotch commissioners, ' As for her coming to her presence, considering that at the first, when she came into this realm, her majesty could not find it then agreeable to her honour, being defamed only by common report, much less would she now think it meet or honourable for her to come to her presence, considering the multitude of matters and presumptions now lately produced against her.' Elizabeth mentioned several courses which Mary was at liberty to take for the full vindication of her character, and warned her that her refusal to take any of them would be interpreted as evidence of her guilt. \u2014 Ibid. pp. 491, 492-"], [544, "522 ANGLICANS AND ROMANISTS. BOOK IX Chap. z. Paul IV. a represen tative man especially of such as were resident in Bome, had long been a great scandal to Christendom, and a great cause of the heresy and schism about which so much com plaint was made. The popes are representative men. They are chosen by the clergy. If a more prudent or a more spiritual habit of thought shall become pre valent, so as to affect that class of persons, we may expect to see the effect of it in the character of the men whom they raise to the papal chair. An indica tion of a change of this nature is seen in the choice of Marcellus II. in 1555, a man of unblemished character, from whose influence the happiest results were ex pected. But Marcellus died a few weeks after his election. The next pontiff, Baul IV.-, was also a foremost man in the party disposed to enforce a professional strictness upon the clergy. It seems, indeed, to have been generally thought about this time, that the church could never hope to regain the power she had lost except by means of such men. But it must be remembered that these men of severe ecclesiastical consistency, were valued, not simply, nor mainly, as church reformers, but rather as men who might be opposed with most effect to the Brotestant temper of the times. 'Now, if ever,' said a contemporary, on the election of Marcellus, ' it will be possible for the ' church to put down heresy, and to reform abuses.'* Baul IV., as cardinal Caraffa, had been a zealous sup porter of the inquisition, and of the unaltered creed of the church in the council of Trent. -On his election he had reached the seventy- ninth year of his age. He was tall, thin, with eyes far sunk into his head. But his glance had the fire of youth. His strength was extraordinary. His step was firm. His mind had lost none of its power. His memory astonished every one. He was an admirable linguist, spoke several languages with fluency, and had few equals in theo- * Lett, di Principi, iii. 141."], [545, "523 COERCION AND CONSPIRACY. BOOK IX Chap. z. logical knowledge. His eloquence, moreover, was flowing, and often highly impassioned. Thirty years since he had founded a religious order \u2014 the Theatins \u2014 whose duties were not to be confined to the routine of a convent. They were to become powerful as popular preachers, and to win the hearts of the people by visits to the sick, and burying the dead. In the rigid discipline of his daily habits the new pope had never spared himself, and had spared others as little. And now, how best to uphold the ecclesiastical power to which his vows had pledged him, and how best to crush all opposition to that power, were the objects to which his life was devoted, and with an intensity which only increased with age. He had never turned aside from these objects to any by-ends ; had always been self-consecrated to this work; and how a man who had never sought to make friends, should have found friends enough to raise him to the place of supreme pontiff, was to himself a matter of wonder. His own words were \u2014 it is of God. For awhile, indeed, even the hatred which Baul IV. felt towards the Lutherans, seemed to give place to his hatred of Spain. But even this feeling was only another form of his ruling passion. He was a Nea politan by birth. His family had been distinguished among the opponents of the Spanish ascendancy in that kingdom. That love of Italian independence, and hatred of foreign rule, which have been so con spicuous in a large class of Italians in modern history, had been a strong passion in the soul of Baul IV. from his youth upwards. When cardinal, it had pro duced a breach between him and Charles V. When he became pope, it remained as strong in him as ever. He appears to have judged, that the pontiff who should enable the papacy to throw off the Spanish yoke, would confer a weighty obligation on all who should succeed him. The affairs of Spain were not prosperous, and seemed to promise, that by availing himself of an alliance with France, and other means, this coveted"], [546, "524 ANGLICANS AND ROMANISTS. BOOK IX Chap. z. r-ius iv emancipation might be realized. Nothing could ex ceed the passion of his holiness when the war which he had thus originated began to take an unfavourable turn. He would walk up and down his apartment, says one of his advisers, for an hour together, talk of nothing but his own grievances, and of cutting off our heads, until he had stormed himself out of breath.* But, mortifying as it may have been, he was to find that his care, and toil, and treasure had all been ex pended in vain. Seeing this, and obtaining a semblance of submission to his imperious will, while losing the reality, he turned, with marvellous self-possession, from the field of politics to his old field of church reform. Could he have seen all that was to flow from his policy, the cup of his old age, which was bitter enough already, would have been intensely more so. The war which he originated was to consolidate the Lutheran power in Germany. By means of German soldiers, who sought both with him and against him, the seed of Lutheranism was to be sown both in France and in the Netherlands. He was to see Scot land become Brotestant under the Begency, and Eng land become Brotestant under Elizabeth \u2014 to see Geneva become a centre of power second only to Wittenberg ; and the people on the shores of the Baltic leagued in the same faith with their brethren of the north of Germany. So do men devise their schemes, and so are they frustrated by a power greater than man.f Paul IV. was succeeded by Pius IV., a man in nearly all respects the reverse of his predecessor. Pius IV. was of humble origin, genial in his temper and conversation, Spanish in his attachment, but with nothing of the ostentation or measured dignity of the Spaniard in his manners \u2014 a fresh, portly, joyous man, * Sismondi, Hist.

Eanke, Lives of the Popes."], [547, "COERCION AND CONSPIRACY. 525 BOOK IX Chap. z. diffusing pleasure in a large degree among all who came within his influence. But Bius IV. was not wanting in firmness. He was, moreover, a man of much practical sagacity. In ecclesiastical matters he adhered substantially to the policy of the more austere man who had preceded him. The great event of the pontificate of Bius IV. was the reassembling of the council of Trent, and the con clusion given to its deliberations. Bius was strongly in favour of seeing this great ecclesiastical parliament once more convened. It was not probable now that the civil power would interfere injuriously with its proceedings. All thought, moreover, of any reconcilia tion between Bomanists and Protestants had now come to an end. Nothing remained but that Catholics should know how to agree among themselves. On this last point there seemed for a time to be some diffi culty. The Spaniards in the council called up warm discussion by insisting that bishops were such by divine right, without any necessary dependence on the bishop of Bome. The representatives of Austria raised greater difficulty by urging that the cup should be ceded to the laity, that the clergy should be allowed to marry, and that much of the public service should be in the vulgar tongue. The king of France, also, through the cardinal of Lorraine, was in favour of having the communion in both kinds, and the psalm ody, and some other parts of the administration of the church, in the language of the people. The French clergy, indeed, wished that the decisions of the council of Basle should be accepted ; and maintained strongly that the authority of a general council was above the pope. It is clear, that had the representatives of the four powers been equally proportioned, the conclusions of the council of Trent would hardly have been such as we now find them. But so little equitable was the constitution of this assumed representation of the church, that the Italians alone outnumbered the other three nations. After much hesitation, the Spanish ques-"], [548, "526 ANGLICANS AND ROMANISTS. BOOK IX, Chap. z. Dec. i5\u00ab3, Pius V, another re presenta- tive man. tion concerning episcopacy was disposed of in terms which meant nothing, and Austria and France were pre vailed upon to surrender their preferences for the sake of unity. So there was to be no communion in both kinds, no marriage of the clergy, no service in the vulgar tongue, nothing to distinguish the church in the centuries to come from the church in centuries long departed \u2014 except that its characteristic features were now more developed, made more definite, and more secure than ever against change. The fathers of the council wept with joy over this unanimity \u2014 looked upon it as inspiration, not seeing that by anchoring their church in this manner in the past, they had made it inevitable that she should lose her place more and more in the stream of the future. Bius IV. survived the settlement at Trent two years. In his successor Bius V. the parties who were expecting so much from a revival of the more sever'e virtues of the priesthood, saw another Baul IV. Bius V. began his course as an obscure monk, and had been remarkable for his strict and ascetic habits in every stage of his career. He became prior of his convent, a great polemic in defence of the Bapal supremacy, and a relentless inquisitor in quarters where his activity in that capacity exposed him to much danger. Under Baul IV. he was commissioner of the inquisi tion in Bome, and in common with that pontiff, found his daily and his favourite employment in attending to the dark and cruel proceedings of that tribunal. As pope, he was strictly the man he had always been. But in that high station, his simple habits, his great air of piety and humility, and .the white locks which fell beside features that seemed to beam with kindli- ness, contributed to make him an object of much popular veneration, especially in church processions. He was withal most attentive to the administrations of every kind proper to his office. Grave Catholics, like Bhilip II. ; and pious Catholics, like the cardinal Borromeo, looked on the elevation of Bius V. as the"], [549, "527 COERCION AND CONSPIRACY. advent of a man sent to do a great work. Certainly, book ix, if a narrow, conventional, and factitious piety, and a CHAP\" *' fixed intolerance \u2014 a merciless hate, of everything which did not happen to be in accordance with that piety, were the qualities eminently adapted to make the world better, the pontificate of Pius V. might be reasonably so regarded. It is said of this man, the man with the white locks and the saintly countenance, that he was never known to forego, nor even to soften a penalty ; that if he had any regret at all in looking to the past in that respect, it was regret that the punish ments he had awarded had not been more weighty. His passion in this direction led him to rake up offences which had been buried ten or twenty years in the past ; and any branch of the Holy Office which fell below others in its registration of penal inflictions, came under his suspicion on that account.* Such was the man who wielded the spiritual thunders of the Papacy, when the errors of Mary queen of Scots brought much trouble, not only on herself, but on Elizabeth. To the ministers of Elizabeth, the Bomanism em- England* bodied in the decrees of the council of Trent, was well represented in the character of Bius V. We scarcely need say that it became them to keep a watchful eye on the movements of such agencies. What could be done to depose the daughter of Anne Boleyn from her throne, and to give her kingdom to another, would assuredly be done. Nor are we left in ignorance of the visions of this nature in which statesmen and ecclesiastics in those days were disposed to indulge. Lutheranism in Germany was a stubborn heresy, which had proved too strong to be vanquished by pope or emperor. But Calvinism in France was a more recent growth, and widely as it was diffused, might still, it was thought, be suppressed. Heresy in the Low Countries, too, though old as the origin of * Ranie, Lives of the Popes, bk. iii,"], [550, "528 ANGLICANS AND ROMANISTS. BOOK TX Chap. z. Dec. iSOz Lutheranism, and though it had to this time resisted all the wholesome severities which the state and the inquisition could oppose to it, was not supposed to be so formidable as to preclude the hope of its being effectually eradicated. The Catholic powers, especially Spain and France, being thus successful against im piety in their own territories, would be free, it was said, to combine their force against the common enemy in Scotland and England. So acceptable were ideas of this description in Bome, that even Bius IV., that pleasant, gentle person, who seemed to discharge the duties of his office so cheerily, sent the Guises of France 100,000 crowns to enable them to subdue the Protestants of that kingdom, and defrayed the cost of 6000 soldiers engaged in that pious labour.* The Catholic ambassadors were all in close league with the French government in support of this project. Philip himself was occupied in negotiations to detach the king of Navarre from the side of the Huguenots, and some thousands of Spaniards were in the Catholic army.f Cecil was observant of these events, and looked beyond them. The desire of the Guises, he remarked, is to have Scotland and England in their power as one kingdom ; and the desire of the pope is to see his authority re-established without further danger of disturbance \u2014 and those parties will not be at rest while they can cherish the least hope that such aspirations may be realized, j It was this conviction which disposed Elizabeth to ally England with continental Protestantism, and to send men and money soon after her accession to the aid of the Prince of Conde. The battle of Dreux was proclaimed by the * Forbes, State Papers, ii. 4. What is worse, his Holiness exacted, as the condition of his assistance, that the king of France should resciud all his late edicts, ' which were half Huguenot and half Catholic,' and substi tute others, in which there should be no compromise, in their place.\u2014 Le Plat. v. 189. f Ranke, Civil Wars in France, i. c. 13.

Bomanists as a great victory, and it was celebrated as bookix. such before the fathers of the council of Trent in an Chaf' *\" elaborate oration. But in this first religious war in France, victory was not declared on either side. Many lives were lost. Much cruelty was perpetrated. The pacification which followed wTas a compromise \u2014 includ ing less than the Protestants had claimed, but much more than their enemies had been willing to grant.* The Edict of Pacification thus obtained, served to France and keep the two great parties in France in comparative lands' quietude during the next three years. But during the ,SC7' three years which followed, the continent was every where moved by the conflict which raged between Catholics and Brotestants. The progress of the re formed doctrines in the Low Countries had become such, that Bhilip had resolved to suppress them by the most coercive measures, and the duke of Alva had committed himself to that career of treachery and atrocity in those provinces which was to make his name an infamy. f In 1567, the Brotestants of France were again in arms. In the eyes of Philip, an unsettledness of that nature in France, was as a raging fire in the house adjoining his own. In the eyes of Pius V. it was one manifestation of a cancerous evil, which must be everywhere traced out and removed, if the church or the world was ever to be at rest.

Pius was especially liberal in his offers of assistance, and earnest to the last degree in denouncing all compro mise with heretics. In these circumstances, it was natural that the Huguenots should look to Germ any and England, and no less natural that Germany and Eng land should respond to the call thus made upon them.* Now the reader has to remember, that it was while this second war between the Catholics and Huguenots of France was pending, and with a doubtful prospect to the latter ; while Alva was crushing Protestantism with an iron hand in the Netherlands ; and while every step in the expected triumphs of the Catholic belligerents was regarded as a step towards their ultimate achievement \u2014 a change of sovereigns in Eng land, that Elizabeth and her ministers were called to deliberate on the question \u2014 What is to be done with Mary Stuart? Little satisfactory as the late investigation had been, the English queen, with her known disposition to favour crowned heads, was so far moved by the condition of her exiled cousin, and perhaps by a feel ing of the inconvenience of detaining her a prisoner, that upon her pledging herself not to look to any foreign aid in her quarrel with her subjects, Elizabeth ' used very pressing mediations with Murray and other ' nobles, for the restoration of the queen to her regal ' authority,' or, at least, to some portion of it.f But these ' pressing mediations' led to no result; and soon afterwards, the name of the Scottish queen became implicated in so many doubtful matters, as to render it improbable that thoughts of that friendly descrip tion would be longer entertained. Early in 1569, there was a rumour that the duke of Norfolk was about to marry the queen of Scots. Suspicion also arose, that behind this project of * Ranke, Civil Wars in France, i. c. 14. f Camden, 419."], [553, "531 COERCION AND CONSPIRACY. BOOK IX Chap. 2. marriage were other schemes, fraught with treason against the liberties and the crown of England. But nothing of this more serious description could be detected. It was deemed prudent, however, to sub ject the captive queen to a stricter oversight. Search was made for her private correspondence. Certain noblemen were summoned to make their appearance at court. Several lords obeyed the summons, but confessed nothing beyond some talk about the pro posed marriage, which they professed to think, if sanc tioned by her majesty, might be for the public good. Among these lords we find the earls of Arundel and Pembroke. Norfolk was summoned, but excused him self. He was suffering from ague, and would attend in a few days. In truth, he was suffering from fear, and had hastened to a distance in the hope of ascer taining what the government really knew concerning his unfortunate course of proceeding in this matter. When he presented himself, in obedience to the peremptory command of the queen, it appeared that the rumour about the marriage was true, but nothing more could be proved. Nevertheless, the suspicions of the government were such, that it was deemed ex pedient to send the duke to the Tower. And the bishop of Boss, Mary's ambassador in London, a busy man in all these affairs : and an agent named Bidolfi, a much more dangerous person, were sent to the charge of Sir Francis Walsingham.* The earls of Northum berland and Westmoreland were among the persons sent for by the queen. Those noblemen, suspecting that their treason had become known, rushed into premature revolt \u2014 a common error in the history of conspiracies. The government naturally supposed that men taking such a course had counted the cost, and knew their strength. There was a mystery in the movement which occasioned perplexity. Beside the mystery, there was great difficulty in dealing with any * Camden, 421. M M 2"], [554, "532 ANGLICANS AND ROMANISTS. BOOK IX Chap. z. The papal conspiracy as reported by Ro- manists. disturbance of this nature in the north. The majority of the people in those parts wTere still Bomanists, and the men in arms collected there came from families in which the nearest kindred were opposed to each other in religious faith, and were not inclined to come face to face in a field of battle. The reader has seen, that under Henry VIII. the question between Bomanism and Brotestantism, was very much a question between north and south \u2014 and it was so still. But when the southern men marched northward, under command of the earl of Warwick and the lord admiral Clinton, the men in those districts, earnest Brotestants and loyal Catholics, rallied largely about them. The immediate effect was, that the insurgents, whose great zeal had been against English Bibles, and whose great cry had been for the old worship, were dispersed, and their leaders sought refuge among the border clans of Scot land. The conspiracy in progress at this time, and to which Norfolk and others were more or less committed, is disclosed to us by authorities of the most unsus picious description \u2014 viz. the biographers of Bius V. The life of this pope, by Catena, is among the recog nised memorials of his pontificate.* From such sources, it appears, that Pius supplied large sums of money, not only to English refugees, but to English nobles about the court. He deputed a special envoy to Scotland with means to stimulate the Catholics of that kingdom into action in favour of Mary Stuart. He took the same course towards England, with the threefold object of liberating the queen of Scots, of ' cutting off' Elizabeth, and of restoring the Catholic religion. His chief agent in England was the Boberto Bidolfi, before mentioned. Bidolfi was a Florentine, who passed for an Italian merchant, but whose real vocation was to urge the great men to insurrection, * Vita delglor. Papa Pio V, scritta da Girol. Catena. Roma, 1587. Camden, 441."], [555, "533 COERCION AND CONSPIRACY. BOOK IX Chap. z. and to ensure the ' destruction of Elizabeth.' While thus occupied with his own direct agents, his Holiness wrote earnest letters to the kings of Spain, France, and Bortugal, calling upon them to co-operate with their Catholic brethren in England in their meditated revolt. Through the influence of Bidolfi, the majority of the English nobles, it is said, were combined, with the duke of Norfolk at their head, to bring about the desired change. The duke was to become the hus band of the queen of Scotland, and as the duke was popular, in that way, it was presumed, England might be reconciled to her new sovereign. As this scheme ripened, Bidolfi received 150,000 crowns from the pontiff, which were placed at the disposal of Norfolk, of certain chiefs upon the borders, and of other parties. Everything being thus ready for a rising, earnest suit was made by Bius to Bhilip, urging him to send the pro mised veterans from Flanders. The pope highly ap proved of all that had been done. He wrote to Alva to be prepared to embark the required force. He wrote to Norfolk, bidding him be steadfast and hope ful, and making him every promise adapted to keep him to his misguided purpose. Bhilip entered fully into this scheme ; but, as though even his zeal was scarcely of the required heat, this great spiritual father becomes especially impassioned in writing to him, telling him that rather than this undertaking should fail, he would place himself at the head of it, would pawn the last property of the church, would part with the chalices and crosses of the sanctuary, and even with the garment from his back. Vitelli, a Spanish general, had been some time in London, waiting for the signal to place himself at the head of an invading army. But Alva hesitated to pass the glory of such an enterprise to other hands. The material had been collected. The train had been laid. The match was ready. But there was a pause. Important disclo sures-were made to the English government\u2014 and the moment for action passed away ! The duke of Nor-"], [556, "534 ANGLICANS AND ROMANISTS. BOOK IX Chap. z. folk was sent to the Tower. The government, by thus holding the mainspring of all this machinery in their hands, spread distrust among the conspirators, disturbed everything, and in the end crushed every thing. But so admirably had these confederates kept their secret, that to this moment, the English cabinet, while they had reasons to suspect much, had ascertained little. The marriage project, in its first form, was comparatively harmless. Nothing, it was said, was to be done in that matter, except on the basis of a treaty between the two kingdoms.* But that was the outer line of the vortex. Graver influences followed, and Norfolk, and many more, had by this time been drawn in by them. The secret information which frustrated the conspi racy that had proved so costly to Bius V. no doubt came from Baris. f France had too much on her hands to act as a principal in this combination against Eng land. Success would be the aggrandizement of Spain. Even the union of Scotland and England would not be favourable to French interests. The council in Paris is known to have been divided on those grounds. We learn from Mary herself, that during these nego tiations, the cardinal of Lorraine showed to Catherine de Medici ' how hurtful to the crown of France would ' be the union of the isle of Britain, and thought ' meet that she should advertize the queen of England ' to take order thereto,' \u2014 which Mary described as an ' unkindly dealing ' on the part of the cardinal. { The person who betrayed the secret of the conspirators to the English government in 1569 was known to Catena, but was not to be named. \u00a7 We can easily suppose that person to have been the queen-mother, * Camden, 420. t See a remarkable paper on this subject in Haynes, 466.

In that age, the great springs bookix. of action were connected with religion, but the occa- _\"^_2' sions were not few on which political considerations became paramount, and Protestants and Catholics might be seen mingled together in strange confusion. The inaction of many among the English Catholics The bull of was attributed in some quarters to the fact, that how ever invalid the pretensions of Elizabeth to the throne might be, the Pope had not taken the measures neces sary to release her subjects from their allegiance. Pius V., so successfully counterworked in the paths of con spiracy, was in full mood to remove this impediment. Early in the following year, accordingly, the memo- -sto. rable bull was issued which pronounced Elizabeth a heretic, denied her right to the English throne, absolved her subjects from their allegiance, and subjected her to the sentence of excommunication.* Cecil now imagined his mistress exposed, on all hands, to the dagger of the assassin ; and supposing the failure of that precious life, he saw a deluge of calamities ready to burst in, not only upon England, but upon Pro testant Christendom. Those who had brought that bull into this country, and especially those who had dared to fasten a copy of it on the door of the bishop of London, had so done at the peril of their lives. f It was to be expected that this blast from Bome Parliament would call forth a counter-blast. In the next English Aprii. parliament, it was enacted, that to attempt the death, or personal harm, of the queen ; to declare that she is not the lawful queen of this realm, or that some other person has a better title to that dignity ; to describe * Camden, 427,428. t Fuller {Hist. iv. 365, 366) has enumerated the different opinions of the Romanists touching the pope's bull.

BOOK IX Chap. z. her as a heretic, schismatic, or infidel ; to usurp the right and title of her majesty during her life ; or to affirm that the laws and statutes of the realm may not determine the succession \u2014 should be accounted high treason. It was further enacted, that any person who should assert, by printing or writing, that any one is, or ought to be, the queen's successor, except the natural issue of her body, or should aid in publishing any such printing or writing, should be liable, for the first offence to forfeit half his goods and to be imprisoned for one year ; and for the second offence, should forfeit all his goods and suffer imprisonment for life. It was also made to be law, that whosoever should receive any bull or rescript from the pope ; should be himself reconciled to the church of Bome ; or should reconcile others to that church \u2014 should be judged guilty of high treason ; and that all persons who should conceal such re concilers, should be deemed guilty of concealing trea son ; and that the penalty incurred by those who should relieve such persons, or should bring crucifixes, or any other thing consecrated by the pope, into this kingdom, should be a forfeiture of all their possessions and perpetual imprisonment.* Terrible as these enactments are, it will be seen that their penalties are restricted to voluntary deeds or words ; they do not require men to convict themselves, nor do they deal with mere opinion as crime. So far, even these measures are distinguished from the persecuting laws we have seen so conspicuous in our ecclesiastical history. But these English senators do a dreadful thing \u2014 they make the priest to be a traitor who shall reconcile a convert to his church, and they make the convert a traitor in being so reconciled, while, according to the speculative belief of both these parties, without such reconcilement there is no salva tion. These Brotestant legislators, however, are hu mane persons, in comparison with that old man, who, * Statutes, 13 Eliz. c. 2."], [559, "537 COERCION AND CONSPIRACY. from his safe enclosure within the walls of the Vatican, book ix, sends forth his anathemas in such fashion, as to shut Chap' z' up the people of his faith, through a whole kingdom, to the necessity of choosing between being traitors to their sovereign in this world, or children of perdition in the next. For these are his words, ' We charge and ' command all and every, the noblemen, subjects, ' people, and others aforesaid, that they presume not ' to obey her [Elizabeth], her orders, mandates, and ' laws ; and those who shall so do, we subject to ex ' communication.'* The act of reconciliation with the church of Bome, was construed by the parliament as treason, because it was assumed to be a formal adoption of the creed of Bius V., which overflowed with treason \u2014 treason against Elizabeth and against the English nation. But fanaticism, whether in pope or Brotestant, hath no bowels. Happily, even in that age, intelligent Eng lish Catholics were not greatly influenced by such lisplays of priestly arrogance on the part of their chief. The secret information which had led to Norfolk's xorfoik re arrest, had not furnished the evidence necessary to to the conviction. The duke was released from the Tower Tower' in August, 1570. He was, however, under charge elsewhere until the September of the following year. He was then sent to the Tower a second time, and on evidence which proved fatal to him. Norfolk had assured Elizabeth, that nothing should come of the rumour about his marriage with the queen of Scots. His wish, he said, that his head might be safe upon his pillow, would suffice to prevent his choosing such a woman for his wife. But the con nexion was not really dissolved. Epistles, amatory and political, continued to pass between them. This was the state of affairs in relation to the duke in the spring of 1 57 1. In April in that year, a man named * Camden, 428."], [560, "538 ANGLICANS AND ROMANTSTS. BOOK IX Chap. z. August. Bailly was detained at Dover, a packet of letters, written in cypher, being found upon his person. This man proved to be in the service of the queen of Scots. He had been in communication with Bidolfi in the Netherlands ; and the letters in his possession were from that emissary to Norfolk, to Leslie, bishop of Boss, and to the baron of Lumley, apprising them oi the result of his negotiations with the duke of Alva. These letters passed into the hands of lord Cobham, governor of the Cinque Borts. But Leslie, who was expecting them, hastened to the governor, and sue-' ceeded in abstracting the letters Bailly had brought, and in substituting others in their place \u2014 old letters which had been before the council, and from which no harm could follow. Bailly, however, was put to the rack, and revealed that the letters which had been en trusted to him had been taken by Leslie, and that in those letters the parties addressed were informed that Alva approved of the projected invasion of England. Close search was made, by lords of the council, in the ambassador's house ; but the bishop had provided against that event. The documents were not found. Boss was placed in the custody of the bishop of Ely, and several gentlemen were sent to the Tower. These events brought new suspicion on Norfolk. Three months later, it was ascertained that the duke had certainly been concerned in sending money to lord Herries and his followers, who, as partisans of the queen of Scots, had ravaged the English borders, and had been proclaimed enemies. The documents which now came into the hands of the cabinet, showed that Mary was in active correspondence with the French court, and with the duke of Alva, on her affairs ; that she was wont to communicate with Norfolk on all her proceedings ; that she was expecting to be married to him, to have her son educated in Spain, to find Bidolfi successful in seeking military assistance from Alva, and to see the Catholic worship restored in Britain.* * Camden, 434\u2014438."], [561, "539 COERCION AND CONSPIRACY. Happily for England, nearly a generation had bookix. passed away since a peer of the realm had been seen j^^f on his trial under the charge of treason. The trial of The trial ot Norfolk was conducted with all the ancient formalities. 1571. The place of the proceedings was Westminster Hall. A platform was raised which extended from the entrance gate to the length of the building. On either side rose tiers of benches covered with cloth. At the farther end, raised somewhat above the plat form, was the seat occupied by George Talbot, earl of Shrewsbury, who presided, as lord high steward of Eng land. On his right and left sat the peers, twenty-six in number, who were to hear the case, and to deliver their verdict. In front of the president was a large table where the queen's solicitor, the sergeant-at-law, and other official persons, were seated. Across the hall, at some distance from its extremity, was the bar. The lord high steward having taken his place, and silence being proclaimed, the commission appointing his lordship to his office was read. Then garter king-at-arms presented him with a tall white rod, which his lordship delivered to his gentleman-usher, who stood near him during the whole of the trial, holding the rod erect at his side. The names of the earls and barons who had been summoned were then called over, and each answered to the call. Silence being again proclaimed, the lord-lieutenant of the Tower was commanded to return his writ, and to bring his prisoner to the bar. The duke passed through the crowd, with the lord-lieutenant of the Tower on one side, and Sir Beter Carew on the other. Next to the duke, also, followed the axe-bearer, with the edge of the axe turned away from the accused, in intimation that the sentence of guilty or not guilty had not been given. The clerk of the court then called on Thomas, duke of Norfolk, to hold up his hand, which he did. The clerk, with a loud voice, read the indictment. It declared the duke to have been concerned in treason able communications and proceedings, extending over"], [562, "540 ANGLICANS AND ROMANISTS. BOOK IX Chap. z. the last four years, the aim of which was to release the queen of Scots, to make her his wife, to depose her majesty queen Elizabeth, and, in conjunction with Spain and the papacy, to bring an invading army into this country from the Netherlands for the accomplish ment of these purposes.* Norfolk was in much favour with the people. He was regarded as a Brotestant. He had done service to pious men of that persuasion. His presence was commanding. His manners were genial. He was the richest subject of the crown. f In all these respects his name had been of value to the bad men, and, we must add, to the fascinating woman, who had never ceased to snare his path with treasonable allure ment. He had a right to complain, in common with all state criminals under the Tudors, that reasonable facility had not been afforded him for the vindication of his case. His prosecutors, he observed, had been long collecting and digesting evidence against him, while his own notice of trial had reached him only fourteen hours since. He prayed that the help of counsel might be allowed him, but that was said to be contrary to law. He pleaded the statute which, under Edward VI., had provided that there should always be two witnesses in cases of treason, and that they should be confronted with the accused. But that law was said to have been disowned in the next reign as bearing too hard upon the crown.

The earl of Shrewsbury wept as he pronounced CnAP' l' the sentence. Brivately, the duke implored mercy at the hand of Elizabeth, in humble, earnest, we may say, abject terms. But on his trial he had acquitted him self with much self-possession and ability ; and at his execution, the sympathy of the people was deepened as they witnessed the courage and dignity with which he faced the scene before him. He died avowing him self a sincere Brotestant.* Norfolk had been in league with the Spaniard, and The empire to judge of the feeling with which Spain was regarded L exTenT at that time, we must take our place among the people raCdtecrha\" who then lived. From the extent of its possessions, Spain seemed to have been destined to give law to Christendom. Charles V. had succeeded in combining the several states of that peninsula \u2014 Castile, Arragon, and Granada \u2014 which had long maintained an inde pendent existence, into one great kingdom. Eight centuries of war with the Moor had ended in his being chased from the soil of that fine country. Philip suc ceeded to the undisturbed sovereignty of Spain, and to that of Milan, Naples, and Sicily. Italy was thus at his disposal. Franche Comte was also subject to him. The Netherlands, embracing a cluster of pro vinces far in advance of any other portion of Europe in their industry and productive skill, in their home and foreign trade, and in their general intelligence and public spirit, were a part of his vast patrimony. The Spanish flag was also seen to wave over several valuable islands on the coast of Africa, and over the Philippine and Spice islands in Asia. But, above all, that flag commanded submission in the West Indies, * When news of Norfolk's condemnation came to Mary, she ' wept very bitterly \u2014 protesting that, for anything she knew, he was a true man to the queen her sister.' \u2014 Letter from Sir Ralph Sadler to Burleigh, Ellis, 2nd Series, ii. 330.

The wealth which flowed to the exchequer of Madrid from all these sources was a matter of huge conjecture. No man affected to know its limits. The government, indeed, like all prosperous governments, was prodigal of its means, and often in embarrassment. But bearing in mind its income, not only from its tariffs on the enormous commerce of the Netherlands, but from the gold and silver mines of the new world, the expendi ture of the Spanish ministry must have been such as to sound like fable in the ears of any other government. The maritime power of Spain was everywhere ac knowledged, except by the English, and the exception in that case was limited to the narrow seas. The ships of Spain had come to be of a larger build, and were greatly more numerous, than our own. In military power, too, the palm of precedence could not be denied to that country. Its dark veterans had not only seen service in the greater part of Europe, but had faced the malaria, and crossed, the mountains, of South America; and the mercenaries of Europe, in their choice of service, were generally inclined to look to Spain as being the best paymaster. Soon after his accession, the armies of Bhilip humbled the strength and chivalry of France at St. Quentin and GraA'elines, as they had not been humbled since the victory at Agincourt. Both France and the papacy had looked with jealousy on the power of Spain, and had done their best to lay some check upon it ; but they had failed, and had learnt to submit as to a master. For over all the resources mentioned, the will of Philip was supreme. The promise of a constitutional monarchy in Spain had ended in disappointment. Before the sceptre passed into the hand of Bhilip, the last vestige of liberty in that shape had passed away. No restraint in the form of law could be imposed on the king by peers or people. The only exception to this"], [565, "543 COERCION AND CONSPIRACY. BOOK IX Chap. z.

In regard to religion, the people of Spain were devoted beyond all other people to the service of the papacy ; upholding it in the worst forms of its many handed tyranny, and finding even holiday amusement in carrying out some of its most atrocious counsels. Bhilip seemed to gather up, and to embody in himself, all the tendencies of that sj'stem in their most intense degree. ' Better not reign at all,' was his language, 'than reign over heretics.' ' Is it thus,' said a noble man, when passing before him to the stake, ' tl at ' your majesty can allow your loyal subjects to be ' destroyed ?' ' Yes,' was the answer, ' I would send ' my own son so to die, were he to become vile as thou ' art.'* The reader has seen that Norfolk was finally com- : mitted to the Tower in 1571. In that year, the com- ] munications between the conspirators in league with \\ the Scottish queen and Spain, became especially active. It was then, too, after the Spanish inquisition had been stimulated from year to year to the most relentless prosecution of its work, that Philip was congratulated on having freed his kingdom from the lart traces of Protestantism. By that time, moreover, every Eng lish seaman or trader who came from the Netherlands, and the crowds of fugitive artisans who rushed from those parts towards our shores to escape the malevo lence of their persecutors, all contributed to fill this country with strange news. Men listened with amazement and alarm to descriptions of the reign of terror, and the seenes of blood, by which those once * ' Now [1 \"i 1 \u25a0>] this was the practice of all Jesuits, to possess their pro selytes with high opinions of the Spanish power, as the nation designed by Divine Providence to work the restitution of their religion in England.' \u2014Fuller, Church Hist. v. 98."], [566, "544 ANGLICANS AND ROMANTSTS.

Bersecution and proscription, they were told, stalked through the land, as if bent on reducing the most populous and wealthy country in the world to a wilderness. The most pious men of their generation were perishing in the dungeon, on the rack, or at the stake. The best blood of the country was poured forth like water upon the scaffold. Hence the name of Alva came upon the ear of our Brotestant coun trymen as only another name for an incarnation of the principle of Evil. The bravest and ablest of our statesmen \u2014 our Cecils, and Smiths, and Walsinghams \u2014 remembering how this triumph of arbitrar}- power abroad might be expected to embolden machination at home, went forth to their duties every day with the feeling that no man knew what a day might bring forth. The Spanish ambassador was known to have encouraged an assassin in a meditated attack on Cecil. And in the midst of such a confluence of affairs, and while men's thoughts were thus occupied, came the massacre of St. Bartholomew, in which French Catholics seemed to have determined to make it evident, that if they might not rival Spaniards in arms, they might at least hope to prove themselves their equals in intole- rance, in treachery, and in cruelty. Fear and anger are not good legislators. But, from the circumstances now mentioned, fear and anger had much to do with the course of legislation on the sub ject of religion through the latter half of the reign of Elizabeth. Some years, however, passed after the death of Norfolk without any new cause of apprehen- sion. Every year since Elizabeth's accession had tended to consolidate her power, and to contradict the prognostications of her enemies. Her reign, it was said, would be short, but it had lasted long, and it promised to last much longer. The queen of Scots was soon to have been on the English throne \u2014 but that vision was now more distant than ever. The"], [567, "COERCION AND CONSPIRACY. 545 BOOK IX Chap. z. great majority of Elizabeth's Catholic subjects had shown themselves more disposed to conform to the Anglican worship, and to conduct themselves peace ably, than to brave the dangers and penalties inse parable from resistance. It was manifest to the more ardent section of Bomanists, and especially to the men whose zeal had made them exiles, that if this course of things should continue, their faith in England must soon become all but extinct. Help could no longer be obtained from Oxford or Cambridge, and the failure of educated men as the apostles of the true church in England, must ere long be the failure of the Catholic cause altogether in that kingdom. The object of this class of religionists, accordingly, came to be, to form, and to perpetuate, a better organization of Bomanism in England, by means of an organization for that pur pose abroad. Two men were especially conspicuous in this effort \u2014 Harding and Sanders. Harding had been a zealous Brotestant under Edward, but became a con formist under Mary, and was known under Elizabeth by his controversy with bishop Jewell. Sanders became notorious from his attacks on the character of all the persons who had been prominently concerned in the English Beformation \u2014 attacks which good bishop Andrews described as made up of ' prodigious ' lies,' sent forth by a man with a razor tongue and a brow of brass.* Hence the next alarm after the death of Norfolk, had respect to the number of young English priests who became known in this history under the name of seminarists. These persons were so designated from their being educated in seminaries which existed for that purpose at Douay, afterwards at Bheims, and in Bome and Spain. f Several hundred English priests * Tortura Torti, 143. t The following is the oath by which the students bound themselves to .their service : \u2014 ' I, A.

BOOK IX Chap. z. were sent from those places into this country, to exer cise their functions, and to employ themselves, under any disguise and with little scruple, in efforts to sus tain and to propagate their proscribed opinions. The Jesuits were the guiding spirits in those seminaries, and soon became known in the Catholic families of England as the efficient coadjutors of the missionaries who had been trained to their work by the teaching of that order.* Catholic priests and Catholic laymen had a right to complain of the law which had made even the exercise of the priestly office a crime against the state. Conscience might well assure them, that to violate such a law, could be no offence in the sight of their Maker. But in the estimation of the govern ment, and of the majority of the nation, these emis saries were the teachers of immoral maxims, the apostles of sedition, men prepared to concern them selves with any scheme of conspiracy and blood which might conduce to the success of their schemes. Nor me a member of the Catholic church, as also desiring with a thankful heart to improve so great a mercy of God, have resolved to offer myself wholly up to the divine service, as much as I may to fulfil the end for which this college was founded. I promise therefore and swear, in the presence of Almighty God, that I am prepared from mine heart, with the assistance of divine grace, in due time to receive holy orders, and to return into England to convert the souls of my countrymen and kindred, when and as often as it shall seem good to the superior of this college.' \u2014 Sanders, Be Schism. Anglo. Ap. 116. At one time, the college at Rheims included some two hundred students, the college at Rome seventy, but these were the most considerable. The influence of the Jesuits in these establishments raised the character of the students, but diminished their numbers. \u2014 See Fuller's Church Hist. iv. 349-359. * So early as 1568, one member of this order practised his arts among us in their fullest development. Thomas Heath, brother of that estimable man, Nicholas Heath, formerly archbishop of York, became a Jesuit, and was detected under the disguise of a Protestant clergyman. During the last six years, he had been in different parts of the country, affecting the Anglican or puritan, as might best promote his object ; and sowing scan dal against Protestantism by circulating what purported to be Protestant tracts, but which were the production of fanatics, or of the Jesuits them selves. This offender was placed in the pillory, deprived of his ears, aud branded in the forehead at Rochester. \u2014 Strype, Ann. ii. 272, 273."], [569, "547 COERCION AND CONSPIRACY. was it without reason that they were so regarded, bookix. Among these ecclesiastical persons, it may be doubted Chap' *' if there was a man who did not, in his private con ferences, denounce Elizabeth as a usurper ; who did not maintain that the Scottish queen should be raised to her place ; who did not inculcate maxims at variance with Christian morality and social order ; and who was not especially disposed to attribute authority to the pontiff, which placed the rights of sovereigns, and the allegiance of subjects, wholly at his disposal. At the same time, the libels circulated against the queen, and against all persons whom it was thought expedient to defame, were of the most scurrilous and scandalous description.* The doctrine which sanctions the removal of heretical and deposed princes by assassination, was not generally approved among Catholics even in that age, but it was widely taught and accepted, especially among the Jesuits. The English ministers were aware of this general increase of 111 restlessness, this organized action, on the part of \"greats s desperate men ; and of much plotting, not only against severit> the throne, but against the life of the queen. f The measures of parliament, in consequence, became still more severe, and the latter half of the reign of Eliza beth began to bear too near a resemblance to the same period in the reign of her father. * Camden, Ann. 1584. t ' Here expect not of me a discovery (being no spy by profession) of the cunning contrivances whereby these Jesuits pass and repass the seas, without any detection, yea, suspicion of them ; sometimes under the pro tection of a pass secured from some lords of the privy council for a young gentleman to go over into France, with two or three of his serving men, to learn the language ; sometimes they shuffle themselves into the com pany of an ambassador or his menial servants, and so cover their private falsehood under his public faith. Many English gentlewomen, intended for nuns, are first veiled before their going beyond seas, under pretence of travelling to the Spa for their healths. In their return for England, these Jesuits have found the farthest way about for them the nearest way home ; for out of France or Spain they will first sail into the Low Countries, and thence to England, and so coming immediately out of Protestant parts, es cape without any, or with easy examination.' \u2014 Fuller, Church Hist. iv. 355.

From the frequent use of the rack in prison, and from the recurrence for long years together of such scenes of butchery on the scaffold, and all under pretexts so little consonant with law as it should be, we feel constrained to turn aside. The Church which furnished no martyr under Edward, certainly had her martyrs under Elizabeth. Most of the men who died were no doubt traitors in their hearts : but laws so devised as to bring men under the heaviest penalties as the consequence of discharging purely spiritual functions, or of choosing to be silent when questioned concerning their opinions, do not ad mit of vindication. Better brave much danger than incur the shame of such legislation. Bomanism, indeed, had never scrupled to destroy its victims by such means. But that plea is no vindication. There were persons, even in those times, who began Lord Bur to see their way towards wiser conclusions on such thoughts on questions. Lord Burleigh, soon after capital punish- \"^n^\u00b0\" ments in cases of this nature were resorted to, addressed a remarkable letter to the queen, which showed that his judgment was by no means in favour of such extreme proceedings. On public occasions, he was disposed to put the best colour on what was done by the government ; but in reality he was opposed to the policy which aimed to find treason in thought, and to make men convict themselves by forcing oaths upon them. These vices of administration, co inbred in the policy of the Tudors, he ventured to describe as having neither justice nor expediency to commend them. He would have been content to require that all suspected persons should bind them- fewer than seventy [some of them actually condemned to die, \u2014 all legally deserving death] were by one act of grace pardoned and sent over beyond sea.' \u2014 Ibid. v. 73.

The man refusing- that pledge of allegiance, he maintained, might be justly banished as a traitor, and the man who did bind himself by such an oath, would be severed, by that fact, from the vassalage of the papacy. Nor was it to be said that Catholics were heedless of oaths. That an oath was really a sacred thing with the great majority of them, was evident from the suffering to which they exposed themselves every day rather than swear falsely.* Had these enlightened sentiments been accepted by Henry VIII. and his children, how different would have been the reading of English history for their time !+ Eighteen years had passed since the Scottish queen fled to England, when the succession of conspiracies in which she had been more or less engaged, was fol lowed by one that became more criminal, and more fully known to the government, than any that had preceded. The detection of this scheme was the work of Sir Francis Walsingham, by means of the spies who were in his service, as secretary of state. The ministers of Elizabeth availed themselves very freely of such agencies, and great complaint has sometimes been made against them on that account. But they had to counterwork adversaries with whom intrigue, in every form, had become a profound and elaborate mystery. All that Jesuit sagacity, subtlety, and un scrupulousness could bring into play, was placed in constant requisition against the English government. It is hardly more true that violence generates violence, than that craft necessitates craft. In those days, the safety of the state was not more dependent on its fleet and its armed men, than on the capacity of its rulers to track the enemies of their country in those * Somers, Tracts, 164. f They are views, however, which were in some measure acted upon. \u2014 See note on the preceding page."], [573, "551 COERCION AND CONSPIRACY. labyrinths of conspiracy from which their feet were bookix. never absent. In all these plottings, moreover, Mary Chaf' z' Stuart never ceased to be the person whose interests were to be especially served by them. In the spring of 1586, John Savage, a gentleman savage. who had studied for the bar, but who had since become a soldier in the service of Spain, paid a visit to his countrymen and co-religionists in the seminary at Bheims. Dr. Giffbrd, a teacher in that establish ment, listened to Savage as he narrated his experiences and achievements in the wars, and suggested that something much higher was within his reach. And what is that, was the inquiry. To kill Elizabeth, the so-called queen of England, was the answer. Savage hesitated \u2014 could it be lawful ? Giffbrd assured him that to take the life of a sovereign whom the pope had excommunicated as being a heretic, and as employing her power to uphold heresy, would be highly meritorious, and, in the case of England, would be fraught with the happiest and most glorious re sults. After deliberating for some weeks, Savage bound himself by oath to perpetrate that deed, and he came to England to execute his purpose. Having access to the court, he was to watch his opportunity, and to use his poniard or his pistol as the queen should be returning through the gallery from her chapel, or walking in the garden with her ladies chiefly as her attendants. During some years past, a priest named John Bal- Baiiard. lard, from the seminary at Bheims, had been tra versing England and Scotland, under various disguises, to use his influence in making proselytes, and in strengthening the professors of his faith. By this means he had become well informed concerning the numbers and the feeling of the Bomanists in Britain. While Savage was being indoctrinated at Bheims, Ballard was engaged in endeavours to dispose Spain and France to invade England in favour of the Scot tish queen. Elizabeth had sent military aid to the"], [574, "552 ANGLICANS AND ROMANISTS. BOOK IX Chap, z Babington, Walsing- ham knows all. Flemings. In so doing, it was urged, she had given Bhilip just ground of offence, and had deprived her self of the means of defence if she should be attacked at home. This priest came to England soon after Savage, and passed himself off as a military officer, under the name of captain Fortescue. Ballard was cautioned by those who wished well to his project, that his course was not wise \u2014 that no attempt to invade England could be successful so long as Elizabeth should be alive. He conferred with a friend named Anthony Babington, a young man of good family and means, and of fashionable habits, and who had been in communication with Mary Stuart, at intervals, for some while past. Babington was also of opinion, that nothing could be done by any foreign power, so long as Elizabeth should be in the way. Ballard had become aware of what Savage had pledged himself to do, and made it known to Babington, who at once approved the design, but said it was too weighty an enterprise to be entrusted to one person, and proposed that it should be undertaken by six gen tlemen, Savage being one of the number. Babing ton induced five of his friends to enter into the scheme, and engaged seven others to assist him in carrying out his ulterior purposes, when the signal for such further action should be given. Babington was in vited at this juncture to renew his correspondence with Mary ; and he informed her of all that had been done, and of all that was contemplated. The six gen tlemen were to accomplish their design. Mary was then to be liberated. Spain and France were then to send the promised armament, the English Catholics were to rise, and all was to be changed. But everything done in this matter by Savage, by Ballard, by Babington, and by Mary herself, became known to Sir Francis Walsingham. A young priest named Giffbrd knew of all that had passed between Savage and the ecclesiastics at Bheims, and disclosed it all. Another man was in the confidence of Ballard,"], [575, "COERCION AND CONSPIRACY. 553 and betrayed him in like manner. Sir Amias Baulet, book ix. who had the charge of the Scottish queen, the young C\"AP' z' priest Giffbrd, and two or three other parties, con trived to intercept the letters between Babington and Mary, read the cipher, made copies of them, and then sent them to their destination. So matters were allowed to proceed, until all the parties had sufficiently committed themselves ; and when the moment came in which all was supposed to be ripe for action, the wheels were suddenly checked, the parties were seized, were separated from each other, and placed under rigorous restraint. It was arranged that Mary should be arrested while out on a hunting excursion, and that her secretaries should be seized, and her papers secured, before any of the documents in her possession could be destroyed. Savage, Ballard, Babington, and four friends of the latter, all implicated in the in tended assassination, confessed themselves guilty, and were executed with much barbarity. The other seven were also condemned and executed, but were allowed to hang until they were dead.* The removal of such men, however, was a small Proceed. matter. The queen of Scots herself was the great the queen difficulty. That Mary should be disposed to look toosScots\" Spain, to France, or to any other power whose influ ence might be used in favour of her liberation, was only reasonable. We can even excuse her in feeling considerable sympathy with those who might be in clined to resort to some measure of stratagem, or force in her behalf. But that she should be found plotting in the most direct manner to bring about an invasion of the kingdom, and to subject both crown and people to a foreign power, was a grave business. Such, how ever, had been the course taken by the Scottish queen with little intermission through all the years of her detention in England. Any other person in the realm doing once, as she had done often, would have been * State Ti-ials,i. 1127-nco, 1174-1181. Camden, 515-517."], [576, "554 ANGLICANS AND ROMANISTS. book ix. arraigned as a traitor, and executed as such. On this Chaf' z' ground, the people and the parliament had been loud long since in their denunciation of her conduct, and in their call for proceedings against her. The asso- jn t]ie year preceding the detection of this last plot, a the protec- number of persons, of all grades, had bound themselves queens\"16 by a voluntary oath to pursue parties who should make any attempt against the person of the queen ' to the ' utter extermination of them, their counsellors, aiders, ' and abettors ;' and should the death of her majesty be procured in favour of any pretender to the throne, these persons further bound themselves to resist the claims of such pretender, or pretenders, and to prose- cute every such person to the death. This last pro- vision was evidently levelled against the queen of sanctioned gcots. Barliament gave its sanction to this organiza ment, ' tion. We see in its existence the sense of danger which was then abroad, and something of the temper which had taken possession of the minds of intelligent men as the consequence. The dreamers who flattered themselves that to kill Elizabeth would be to enthrone Mary, would have been miserably disappointed had the queen fallen by their hand. Mary would not have survived Elizabeth a week. Decided The first conference in respect to what should be done thut the \u2022 -*- -r~. proceedings with Mary Stuart, was between Elizabeth and Burleigh sfarySt alone. When the cabinet came to deliberate on that smart shaii question, some would have restricted the penalty to a be in open . \u25a0*\u25a0 ** court, and more rigorous confinement. But Walsingham, with tolaw!\"8 fne ample materials in his hands, pleaded that there should be a trial, and a verdict according to law, and the majority of his colleagues were with him on that point. The case of the queen came within the statute 25 Edward III. ; but it was decided that the prosecu- tion should be grounded on the act of the last year, passed in recognition of the ' Association ' for the protection of the queen's person. In that act, it was provided that any person claiming the English crown,"], [577, "COERCION AND CONSPIRACY. 555 attempting to seize it, or to harm her majesty's bookix, person, by means of invasion or conspiracy, should j^f_-\" suffer death. The court of justice before which the queen of Scots Jfh-eJt\u00b0\"* was required to make her appearance, consisted of forty-six persons, who were all either peers of the realm or officers of state. Their place of meeting was Fotheringay Castle, where the queen was then resident. Mary disowned the authority of this tribunal. She was not an English subject, and could not, she insisted, be justly dealt with as subject to English law. Moreover, she was a sovereign, an independent sove reign, and responsible to God only. Of course, neither of these pleas could be admitted. Every alien in England claims the protection of English law, whether resident by constraint, or willingly. But no one can claim the protection of law without obedience to law. Security and submission are reciprocal. Concerning princes as being responsible to God only, little needed to be said. Monarchs have too often acted as though that doctrine were true. But positive law, and the instincts of nature, have combined to place a check, and sometimes a very rough check, upon such assumptions \u2014 assumptions as impolitic in the prince, as they are unjust towards the subject. Mary, finding that the court would certainly proceed, whether she appeared or not, and would judge her case according to the evidence, consented, under protest, to meet the commissioners, that she might hear the evidence and vindicate her innocence. It might well seem a hard course of proceeding to place a queen before such a tribunal, strictly alone, without allowing her the benefit of counsel, or the advantage of examining the witnesses whose depo sitions were produced against her. The complaint of Mary on these grounds was natural. Our law, however, had never ceded counsel in such cases ; and, unhappily, the good law of Edward VI., which required the viva voce evidence of two witnesses, was a law of"], [578, "556 ANGLICANS AND ROMANISTS. book ix. the statute-book only \u2014 it had never been acted upon.* [HAP z' Under these cruel disadvantages, the queen acquitted herself with much self-possession, ability, and dignity. But the mass of evidence against her was irresistible. On the second day she admitted what she had denied on the first \u2014 that she had written more than once to Babington. She also acknowledged that she had corresponded with various persons abroad, in the hope that an invasion of the kingdom might give her the liberty she so much desired; and that she had led the king of Spain to expect that her right of succession to the English throne would be conferred upon him. To confess thus much was to confess treason. f The only Two questions now remained to be settled \u2014 Is there seTtieiiT \u00b0 evidence that Mary Stuart was a consenting party to this case. project for the assassination of Elizabeth?

Her natural tendency to judge in the most lenient Chap' *' manner concerning her own acts, and the casuistry of the training to which' she had been subject as a Catholic, in the worst school of that faith, suffice to make many strange things probable in her case. To recover her queenly power, and re-establish the Catholic faith, she was prepared to see Elizabeth, and every conceivable impediment beside, swept utterly away. If not dealt with as guilty of treason and intended murder, it could hardly be for the want of evidence on those points.* It is urged by the partisans of the Scottish queen, Letters be that the letters produced as having passed between IndBa- ary her and Babington were copies only.

It has been suggested that the copies of these letters may have been interpolated, and that the interpolations may have consisted in the series of references to the intended assassination. But Savage, Babington, Ballard, and Don, all heard these copies read, all attested that they knew the contents of the originals, and all declared them to be faithful tran- scripts. Could this have been, if the most startling feature in the copies had been altogether wanting in the originals? Could their memory so have failed * ' There are no accessories in treason, as in other offences ; all are principals ; and any person offending in treason, either by overt act or by procurement, whereupon open deed has ensued, is adjudged by the law to be a principal traitor.' \u2014 Philips, State Trials, i.

If not, what could have induced men under the heaviest sentence of the law, to have made themselves parties, as they did in the most explicit terms, to so villanous a fabrication, knowing it to be such ? There was nothing disclosed in these letters which these men did not themselves confess ; and Savage and Babington, whose confessions were the fullest, gave their information without torture, or auy threat of that nature. Mary's two confidential secretaries were slow to furnish information. This course was natural, if they had any affection for their mistress, or any care to avoid being implicated in her treasons. But in the end, they too affirmed the letters in question to be genuine, and confessed all that the conspirators had confessed. Their confession, indeed, was made in the hope of favour, but -it is not probable that they would have charged their unfortunate mistress with a crime so infamous, if they had known her innocent.* In the letters produced, there is no trace of interpolation or of mutilation. The parts all hold together, and are necessary to each other. If interpolation was made at all, moreover, it must have been made at a time when the interpolator had reason to expect that his spurious copy would be soon confronted with the original. f * Nau, Mary's principal secretary, said, in his confession, that his mis tress told him to burn the copies of the letters sent to Babington. \u2014 Hard wicke, State Papers, i. 237.

The court of justice did not deliver its judgment at book ix. Fotheringay. That was reserved, in obedience to the c^_~ pleasure of Elizabeth, to a second meeting. Sentence sentence was pronounced in the Star Chamber. It declared \u2014 Eliza- Mary Stuart guilty of treason, and of being privy totation.'es the atrocious purpose of Anthony Babington against the person of the queen. Barliament assembled soon afterwards, and petitioned Elizabeth to carry this sentence into execution. The queen hesitated, and the two houses renewed their petition. We can readily suppose that Elizabeth felt real difficulty in coming to a decision. With her high notions con cerning sovereign authority, it was not a small matter to send a person who claimed the dignity of queen of Scotland, and of queen- dowager of France, to the scaffold. That person was, at the same time, a near relative ; and Scotland, France, and Spain might be expected to take deep umbrage at such a proceeding. It was from these considerations, and from a wish that what should be done might be done with the sanction, and at the demand of the nation, that the queen procrastinated. It was for these reasons that more than three months were allowed to intervene between the appearance of the queen of Scots before her judges in the great hall at Fotheringay, and her appearance in that hall to place her neck upon the block. Mary met that doom with great firmness. No heroine in a Greek tragedy could have shown so much dignity. But she had persuaded herself that her death was a martyrdom, and that, as such, it would be accepted as covering many sins. France and Scotland vowed revenge. Both took counsel from second thoughts. The man who watched these pro ceedings from his palace at Madrid, was more in earnest. The connexion of Bhilip with England had been Phii:P'3 altogether disappointing and humiliating.

His high and reserved manner, which had given so much offence to the Flemings, he lowered and softened, to the extent of his power, in his intercourse with the English. His ministers congratulated each other on the great change in this respect which they observed in him. But his Castilian pride was wounded as he saw,' that after all his condescensions, the hearts of the islanders were not won. The spirit and bearing of the English nobles and gentry ceded nothing to the greatest persons in his retinue. The people, at the same time, betrayed, in many ways, their hatred and scorn of the strangers, and seemed much more dis posed to challenge strife than to court amity. All this, in Bhilip's estimation, was so much insolence, and an insolence which he never ceased to feel it would be a very pleasant thing to chastise. This feeling was not abated when Elizabeth declined the offer of his hand ; and it rose into indignation when she sent her soldiers to the aid of his revolted subjects in the Netherlands. From all these causes, the policy of Bhilip became a policy bitterly hostile to England. One other cause, more weighty than the rest, was to be placed in the same scale. Catholic Europe had no prospect of peace while England remained heretical and independent. This island was the natural base of the great struggle between heresy and orthodox}-. To crush England, would be to crush the many-headed monster which passed under the name of Brotestantism. So far back as 1570 Bhilip had seriously meditated the invasion of this country. During the last three years he had been especially occupied in preparations for that enterprise. All the ports in his dominions supplied their contingents in vessels, seamen, and able captains. Sicily, Naples, Northern and Central Italy, and Fortugal, became tributaries to this object. Above all, the Netherlands were made to furnish ships, men, and means, upon a large scale. The ships built and collected, formed a fleet such as the shores of Europe"], [583, "COERCION AND CONSPIRACY. 561 had never seen. Some of the vessels were of enor- bookix, mous dimensions, rising high above the water, with CHAF' '' heavy tiers of guns in their sides, and their lofty decks skilfully fortified, making a near approach to a modern line-of-battle ship. The fleet was manned by some 8000 seamen, and carried more than 20,000 soldiers, with abundance of arms and ammunition, and provi sions for six months. One portion of the apparatus constituting this 'Invincible Armada' must not be overlooked. It bore with it a vicar-general of the Holy Inquisition, and a large number of priests and Jesuits, who, when the artillery of the expedition should have accomplished its purpose, were to wield an artillery of another kind. But the fleet which was to darken the sea along the coast of Spain did not present the most formidable front of the power by which our English home was then menaced. The duke of Barma, who ruled in the Netherlands, was appointed military chief in this great undertaking. Italy sent nine thousand men to his standard. Castile and Arragon, Austria and Ger many, deputed their thousands in the same direction. The forest of Waes was levelled to furnish the flat bottomed boats, which, under the convoy of the Spanish fleet, were to land an army of a hundred thousand strong at the mouth of the Thames. So soon as this should be accomplished, the pope was to send a mil lion of ducats to the service of the invaders. So con fident, too, of success was his Holiness, that he made Dr. Allen, president of the English seminary at Bheims, a cardinal, appointed him legate for the apos tolic see in England, and issued a new bull against Elizabeth, which denounced her as a bastard and a heretic, as treacherous, dissolute, and tyrannical. It had of course been impossible to conceal these uneer preparations. But vast as they were, their object ItTobjcct. was kept a profound secret. The whole of this machinery had been put into motion, and the duke of Guise in France, the duke of Barma in the Nether- 11 00"], [584, "562 ANGLICANS AND ROMANISTS. BOOK IX Chap. z. What was done in England. lands, Sixtus V. in Bome, and the Spanish ambassador in England, were the only persons who knew the point on which all this thunder was to burst. Some supposed that the blow meditated would fall on the Netherlands. Others gave out that something new and wonderful was to be attempted in the Indies. Until the day on which this memorable force left the Tagus, Elizabeth, and even Burleigh, had been lulled into a false security by Bhilip's apparent willingness to bring the negotiations for peace going on in the Netherlands to an amicable close. The armada was at sea, and nothing special had been done in England towards meeting such a crisis. Of late, the government had thought more about sending help to the Flemings, than about protecting their own shores. Happily for it, the enemy became exposed to foul weather, and to infectious disease, off Cape Finistere ; and to repair damages, and to recruit strength, was obliged to return for awhile to the ports of Biscay and Galicia. By this time there was no want of movement in England. Order was issued that every man from eighteen to sixty should enrol his name, and be pre pared to take his weapons, as a defender of his country. An army of nearly seventy thousand men, about four thousand of whom were cavalry, was soon brought together. One division of this force was under the command of the earl of Leicester, and was to act against the enemy where he should attempt to land. The other division was entrusted to earl Hunsden, a soldier of experience and fidelity, who was to act in defence of the queen's person. Meanwhile, the fleet collected from different ports numbered nearly two hundred vessels, manned with more than 15,000 seamen. London did her duty, supplying thirty-eight ships out of the above number, and a large body of able sailors. The names of Drake, Frobisher, Winter, and Hawkins stand out as those of great naval commanders in that hour of life or death. Young men, and men with grey hairs, flocked"], [585, "COERCION AND CONSPIRACY. 563 from the noblest families to the side of these famous bookix, captains. Lord Howard of Effingham, the lord Chap' z' admiral, was chief in command. Next in authority to his name stood that of the immortal Drake, who had often shown his marvellous skill and courage in scouring the Spanish seas. Blymouth was chosen as the place of rendezvous. The fleet from Spain must needs pass that point on its way to act as convoy to the military force collected in the Netherlands. That fleet now put to sea a second time. As it passed Cape Breton, men gazed at it from the shores of that pro vince with wonder, and seemed to confess that it might well be called ' invincible.' As this grand armament came within sight of Fly- The two mouth, the multitude of ships, and the height and n\"ar bulk of many of them, presented such a spectacle as plymouth mariner had never seen before. In the distance it was as if a great city had been floating on the deep. The strength of the English bore no proportion to the strength opposed to them. Favourable incidents, stratagem, greater skill, and the remembrance of the homes to be shielded from this foe, might give them victory, \"nothing else could. But they are brave and veteran men in command of the ships now floating under the English flag below Mount Edgecombe, and the men at their command can hope for much under such leadership. The wind is in favour of the enemy. He might bear down upon the English with great advantage. But to the surprise of our countrymen, who are ready for the fray, the Spaniard seems disposed to avoid an engagement, and to pass on. The fact was, the duke of Medina Sidonia, who was in command, had been instructed by Bhilip, not to eno-ao-e with the English fleet until he should have joined the duke of Barma, and have conducted the army collected in Flanders to the Thames. The admirals remonstrated. But it was in vain. The duke produced his written instructions ; they were explicit and emphatic, and he would not depart from them. oo 2"], [586, "564 ANGLICANS AND ROMANISTS. BOOK IX Chap. z. The Spa- niards pass \u2014the En- glish follow. The fire ships. The end Lord Howard, seeing the enemy pass on, gave com mand to follow, and to attack the ships in the rear. This was done with great success, partly from the English ships being comparatively light and manage able, and partly from the better knowledge of the sea and coast possessed by English sailors. Off the Isle of Wight the English engaged a squadron, and van quished or destroyed every ship which they could bring into the struggle. ' So the two fleets continued their course, until they came opposite Calais, the one intent on moving forward, and the other resolved to follow. Calais was only a few leagues from the point where the maritime and military force of the armada were to combine, and from which they were to advance conjointly towards their common object. But Drake was as intent upon preventing that com bination of forces, as the Spaniard was upon realizing it. Evening came on. The wind became fresh. The sky grew dark and threatening. When the darkness had set in, Drake chose eight of the least serviceable of his vessels, filled them with combustible materials, and having brought them near to the Spanish fleet on the windward side, set them on fire, and drifted them into the midst of the great armament, now fast at anchor. The Spaniards were filled with panic. A whole fleet had been thus destroyed not long since near Antwerp. They cut their cables, and rushed wildly into the open sea. But the wind had lashed the sea into fury. Shifting westward, it drove many of the Spanish ships, and some of the most formidable of them, on the coast. As the day dawned, the English were everywhere upon them. In the course of that night and morning nearly five thousand Spaniards perished, either as wrecked by the storm, or as sunk by the onslaught of their assailants. Banna's army could not now be wafted to the Thames. The great armada was felt to be a failure. The Spaniards had imbibed a horror of our narrow seas. Their only thought was how to escape from them as quickly as possible. Bather than enter them"], [587, "COERCION AND CONSPIRACY. 565 again, and with the exulting English ready to dispute book ix. their passage, they determined to sail round Scotland Chap' *; and Ireland, and to endeavour to reach Spain by the northern ocean. The coasts of Elizabeth's dominions, especially the coast of Ireland, were strewed with wrecks. Of the vast force which had sailed from the Tagus, not a man was allowed to place a willing foot on the territory of the English queen. But thousands were thrown, alive or dead, upon the shores which owned her sway. Of the Invincible Armada, a miser able remnant only survived to tell the tale of their disaster and their shame. We have now reached the point in the purpose of Retrospect this chapter, from which we may glance at the extent s\" of the revolution in the comparative positions of Anglicans and Bomanists under Elizabeth. As the designs of Bhilip against this country in Altered \u00ab 1588 were made plain, it became evident that the death tnedeathof of the queen of Scots had brought a very material change into the relations subsisting between English Bomanists and their friends in other states. Con spiracy could no longer take the plausible aspect of being in favour of the Scottish queen, whose right to the throne, if not to be admitted as preferable to that of Elizabeth, was generally acknowledged as being next in succession. Nor could any use be made of the son of Mary Stuart, inasmuch as James had avowed himself a zealous Brotestant. Hence the mission of Bhilip was an undisguised mission for himself. His conquest, if it had come, would have been another Norman conquest. The grandees of Bhilip II. would have been to the Englishmen of that age, what the nobles and knights of William I. had been to our good Saxon fathers. We learn, accordingly, that at this grave crisis, conduct of even the English Catholics were generally forward catholics!*11 to tender their wealth, and their personal service, to the government. Such conduct, all things con sidered, was highly honourable to that portion of her majesty's subjects. No responsible office was"], [588, "566 ANGLICANS AND ROMANISTS. book ix. entrusted to Catholics, and some of the more suspected Chaf' z: among them were made to restrict their residence for the time to the midland counties, or to the Isle of Ely ; but we have no reason to doubt their general loyalty. Whatever judgment may be formed concerning the execution of Mary Stuart, every one must have felt that two important results had already followed from her removal \u2014 it had obliged the king of Spain to drop the mask, and it had given the queen a much more united people. impression Unhappily, opposed to the good impression which England by should have been made by the conduct of the Catholics madar subject to Elizabeth, was the deeper bad impression concerning all the professors of that faith which had been produced by the conduct of Bhilip. Bomanism had never been so formidably and openly identified with hostility to England. The feeling of the English people came to be more than ever \u2014 no peace with Bome \u2014 no settlement of differences in that quarter \u2014 Englishmen must hope to be free, only as their own good weapons shall suffice to vindicate their freedom. penai laws The penal laws against Bomanism, accordingly, airainst Ro- . \" . manists continued on the statute-book, and in some respects continue. were made even more stringent. But the enforcement of those laws, both before the year of the armada and afterwards, was by no means uniform,, and rarely to the letter. During the eleven years which preceded 1588 nearly a hundred Bomanists, prosecuted by the government, suffered death. The number of execu- tions of the same character during the fifteen years which followed was a little above a hundred. The highest reckoning makes the whole to have been 204, which presents an average of somewhat less than eight in a year from the time when such punishments commenced. The average in the year under Mary amounted to ten times that number. It should be added, too, that the sufferers under Elizabeth were all men, not embracing, as in the former reign, a large pro portion of women. And if we may accept the public"], [589, "567 COERCION AND CONSPIRACY. and repeated affirmations of the ministers of Elizabeth, book ix no Bomanist was put to death in her time for purely C\"AP' z' religious reasons. By this statement, however, it must have been meant, that the persons executed were all traitors, in the common acceptation \u2014 such as Babington and Ballard \u2014 -or persons who persisted in the avowal of opinions, which, though assumed to be religious, were really political, and were construed as incompatible with loyalty. Such was the dogma con cerning the supposed power of the pope to depose heretical princes. The man avowing that doctrine, was regarded as declaring, that in his judgment, he owed no allegiance to Elizabeth, and that he should give her none except by constraint. Bomanists who died in consequence of such a confession, died, as they believed, for a great rebgious principle, and were accounted martyrs. But according to their prosecutors, the principle confessed was political, not religious, and their death, in consequence, was the death of traitors. Without attempting to settle this difference, we feel injustice no hesitation in saying, that laws which find treason \u2122y oTfin' in anything short of overt acts betraying treasonable J\u2122*n181,.8W8 intention, are laws which cannot have been just or ex- Romanism. pedient under any circumstances. In the sense explained, it seems to have been true that no Bomanist was executed under Elizabeth on account of his re ligion. Many were known and proved to have been traitors. Such, too, was the sweep of those penal laws, that had the tests which they furnished been generally urged, few could have escaped. We are justified accordingly in supposing, that the persons arraigned according to these severe enactments, were generally persons who had shown more than ordinary signs of disaffection. We do not mean to defend laws which are designed to operate as a terror on the many, and which would become an intolerable cruelty if enforced on more than a few. But such was the intention of the severer statutes against Bomanism. The dogma that popes may depose princes teas inconsistent with"], [590, "568 ANGLICANS AND ROMANISTS. BOOK IX. Chap. z. Doctrines of the Jesuits and semi- nary priests. loyalty. But there was no logical connexion between rejecting transubstantiation or the papal supremacy, and failing to be a good subject. It was, however, on such grounds \u2014 grounds purely ecclesiastical, that Mary and her bishops sent their victims to the stake. The Jesuits and seminary priests who came into England in such numbers during the latter half of the reign of Elizabeth, were resolute in upholding the most extravagant pretensions of the popes. But the great majority of the English Catholics were more moderate men, and the zealots were regarded by them as doing great injury to their cause. Indeed, it was the fact that resistance to the government, and to the spirit of the times, in this body, was becoming visibly weaker, that prompted the refugees of Douay and Bheims, to their covert, perilous, and often guilty mission. The restless and intriguing party kept up by this means in England, were strongly opposed to all measures of conformity, to all pledging of allegiance, in short, to everything that did not look to an extinction of the sway of Elizabeth, and the restora tion of their own worship. These were the men whom the government watched with special vigilance, and from whose ranks some of the more turbulent were sent, at the rate of seven or eight in a year, to the gallows. Meanwhile, the moderate party continued to increase, and moderate Bomanism, from the natural influence of circumstances, ended widely in Anglicanism \u2014 a system wdiich was Brotestant, but designed to be as little offensive as possible to Catholics.* * About 1595. a great schism broke out between the Jesuits and secu lar clergy in England. The clergy complained of the intrigue and ambi tion of the Jesuits, and insisted that the severities of the English govern ment towards the disciples of their faith were to be traced mainly to the maxims and proceedings of the men of that order. The Jesuits, on the other hand, described the priests as inactive and incompetent, leaving nearly everything worth doing to be done by themselves. Many pamphlets, and even volumes, were published by the disputants, which Protestants were not slow to enumerate as signs of the boasted Catholic unity. Nothing could be more bitter than this brawl. \u2014 Fuller, Church Hist. v. 203-21 1, with Brewer's notes."], [591, "569 COERCION AND CONSPIRACY. Before the death of Elizabeth, the generation over book ix. which she reigned in her early years had almost j^if' wholly passed away. The next generation in Catholic K^num families, which had grown up about her, did not tread \u2014partly more than partially in the steps of their parents, poticyosthe Bank, and wealth, and custom floated more and more state' another way, and when such a stream has set in, the young and hopeful, fond of society, and ready to make the best of the world as they find it, are sure to yield, to a large extent, to the current. It is a great mistake to suppose that a system of repression can have little influence on the opinion and feeling of society. If it be strong enough, and continuous enough, it may do much in that direction. How far such ends should be sought by such means, is a point about which we do not now dispute \u2014 what may be thus done in certain circumstances, is another question, and one on which our modern orators some times need enlightenment. We may be sure that those who remained Catholics in the later years of Elizabeth, were Catholics of a decided, and sometimes of a desperate cast \u2014 women led by imagination and feeling ; men, with a high sense of honour, who could not be brought to desert the faith of their fathers in its adversity ; and men, in some instances, of the Guy Fawkes and Catesby type. All hope of changing the religion of the country gradually died out ; and a more tolerant temper in the legislature and the govern ment, seemed to be the utmost that was deemed pro bable or possible. But it must not be supposed that this change had c\u00abt a come wholly, or even mainly, from the influences degree by mentioned. The Brotestant clergy who rallied aspreaching such about Elizabeth on her accession, were themselves the fruit of free discussion, and men who lived in the atmosphere of controversy. Many of them had suffered grievously, at home or in exile, during the last reign ; and free speech with them, meant freedom to expose the supposed errors and enormities of Bomanism, and that with no ordinary iteration and"], [592, "570 ANGLICANS AND ROMANISTS. BOOK IX, Chap. z. emphasis. Even the court clergy, as they were called, whom archbishop Barker may be said to have repre sented, were zealous in this matter, to an extent which, in our time, would be accounted extravagant and fanatical. But these were far surpassed in zeal by the puritan ministers, who formed a large propor tion of the clergy in the early days of Elizabeth, and grew to be more and more formidable through all the years of her reign. The queen, who never failed to look with jealousy on power which was not her own, regarded this sterner class of public teachers with distrust \u2014 we may say with aversion. But the wisest of her councillors, who saw the danger of her time, and saw how that danger might best be counteracted, gave their direct or indirect sanction to these un courtly orators, and often shielded them from the malice of their enemies. According to Lord Burleigh,* no agency * Lord Macaulay (Burleigh and his Times) is disposed to think that the zealous Catholics in England under Elizabeth were a very small minority, a thirtieth part of the nation probably, but that the mass, who would as soon have been Catholics as anything else, might be reckoned at some four-fifths. This is a strange statement. The great argument adduced in support of it is, that the acted drama in that age is singularly respectful towards Romanism. The drama, it should be remembered, was not intended for the rude sparse populations of remote districts, but almost exclusively for the people in large towns, such as London, Bristol, or Coventry, and are we to suppose that the great majority of the population even in those places were indifferent to Protestantism? In 1592, a pam phlet was published, intitled, ' A Declaration of the True Causes of the Great Troubles supposed to be intended against England,' and which was attributed to Father Parsons. In this publication, the writer complains of England as showing more sympathy with the Turk than with king Philip, and adds, ' Therefore, as an introduction hereunto, to make him odious unto the people, certain players were suffered to scoff and jest at him upon their common stages, and the like was used in contempt of his religion, first by making it no better than Turkish, by annexing to the Psalms of David, as though the prophet himself were the author thereof, this ensuing metre, \u2014 'Preserve us, Lord, by thy dear word.

It was to the nation, what the universities were to a class \u2014 a great educating power. Lessons which may be said to have been diffused as widely as the parishes of England, which recurred as constantly as the Sabbath-day, and which were con tinued, with more or less power, through nearly half a century of years, so far influenced the thought and feeling of the nation as to decide the Brotestant character of English Christianity for the time to come. Bhilip's advisers urged him to raise another armada, Position of and to renew his enterprise against England. But protestant'1 that was impossible. The last effort had cost him the hoardings and labours of nearly twenty years. So far mined. from being at liberty to assail England with any prospect of success, his territory in the Netherlands became exposed to special danger from the altered posture of affairs in France. Soon after the defeat of the Armada, the duke of Guise and the cardinal of Lorraine, the heads of the great Catholic faction in that country, ceased to exist. Henry III. was assassi nated. Henry of Navarre, a Protestant, succeeded to the French monarchy, and the Protestant league gave new signs of life.

Where he could make himself felt as the ' Catholic ' king, there were his resources and his armies ; and there also, to face him, were the influences and the soldiers of Elizabeth, the Brotestant queen.

From that hour the history of Spain has been the history of a declining state ; and from that hour the place of England has been that of a state of the first rank, and of a constantly growing influence in the system of Europe. Spain resolved to be the champion of a superstitious and a cruel faith, and her reward has been to sink deeper and deeper in degradation.

Hence comes idolatry. The mysterious forces of nature must have their symbolic figures to represent them ; and every species of religious worship must be a worship of the spiritual through the formal \u2014 of the unseen by the help of the seen. As this tendency of our nature is pushed to excess, men are accounted pious in the measure in which they are thus outwardly obedient. Not to be conformists is to have no religion. So the first Christians, being a people without any visible procession, or priesthood, or temple, were accounted atheists. BOOK X. Chap. i. In consonance with this want of our nature, especi ally when allied with imperfect culture, Judaism had its book of Leviticus. Even Christianity could not wholly dispense with such aids. But the thing to be feared was, that the few and simple rites which sufficed in the apostolic age, would soon be overlaid by others, adopted from a very different source. So it happened. The chasm is wide \u2014 very wide, which separates between the Christian ritual as administered by St. Beter and St. Baul, and as administered by Gregory VII. and Innocent III. It is not difficult to understand how mankind have come to attach great importance to the ritual aspect of religion. Spiritual good, realized in connexion with particular observances, is often supposed to have been realized in some special manner by means of those observances, and so the memory of the external form remains a very pleasant memory. To some minds, if religious worship is to be impressive, it must be vested to a large extent in the external and pictorial. Abstract thought is difficult ; to gaze on the represen tations of such thought is not difficult. To be religious by going through a round of ceremonies is easy. To be religious in the sense of growing from one stage of spiritual life to another, implies watchful ness and effort.

So good feeling, weak feeling, and book x. bad feeling, may all contribute to make people zealous Chap-'\" in respect to matters of religious ritual. . Nor is it difficult to understand how the ministers of religion, and the ministers of state, have come to look with much jealousy on any departure from religious conformity. In such conformity these functionaries see the open recognition of their own authority \u2014 and a recognition of it as extending, not merely to body and goods, but, which is much more, to the mind. It is the public confession of obedience as due both to priest and magistrate. It is an admission, that not merely the outward, but the inward \u2014 the will, should be subject to the sway of those authorities. This -doctrine was well understood by Henry VIII. and Elizabeth. No form of their power was really so precious to them as the supremacy with which they were invested in regard to every thing pertaining to religion. On this subject, men were to believe only as they were required to bebeve, and to do only as they were required to do. To ques tion the infallibility assumed by Henry and by the daughter of Anne Boleyn- over such things, was to wound them in the most sensitive part of their nature. Under Henry VIII. the penalties which came upon Rise of ecclesiastical delinquents came upon them as heretics p^funism, or traitors, more than as nonconformists. The seeds of puritanism among us are no doubt as old as the time of Wycliffe, but they are not developed in our history, so as to become characteristic of a party, before the time of Edward VI. It is to be remembered, too, that what was at that time puritanism in England, was simply Brotestantism on the continent. This difference must be traced to the fact, that while in the other countries of Europe the Beformation began with the people, and was greatly moulded by them ; in England the movement was more dependent on the will of the state, and was determined, in its course and results, mainly by that will. Hence the change in"], [598, "576 ANGLICANS AND PURITANS. book x. the English church left her, even at the death of Ed chapj. war(j yj^ -n a nearer relation to the church of the Middle Age, than any other church in Christendom avowing itself protestant. influence of The dispensation of the Six Articles had made churches on many good men exiles. Rogers, the first martyr toEn\u2122^ un(ler Mary, and bishop Hooper, tire type of English puritanism under Edward, were among the number of those exiles. Residence among foreign Protestants had made them familiar with continental Protestant- ism ; and changes which had commended themselves to the learning and piety of their personal friends in the reformed churches in Switzerland and Germany, were regarded by these devout men as not un suited to the reformed church of England. The ministers of those churches appeared in a distinctive ministerial dress in the service of the church, but they had cast off the surplice, and the other garments usually worn by the papal priesthood. In the judgment of Hooper, the conduct of his friends in this respect was to be commended. When chosen to be a bishop, he claimed that he might be left at liberty to follow their example. The reader has seen that trouble came upon him on this account. Even Cranmer and Ridley were reso- lute in insisting on his conformity. These prelates have been censured for sending Gardiner and Bonner to the Fleet prison \u2014 strange as it may seem, we see them subject their brother Hooper to the same rude form of discipline for a much less fault. influence of Had the life of Edward been prolonged, the puritan persecunan controversy would not have failed to find a place in feeiin\u00b0\"ofhe oul' l^ory ; but the reign of Mary, and the temper the pun- of Elizabeth's administration, made the dispute to be much more formidable and bitter than it would other- wise have been. By zealous Brotestants, the garni ture of the Boman priesthood was soon denounced as the ' idolatrous gear.' But the memory of the scenes in Smithfield and in Oxford under Mary, and of the terror everywhere diffused in the latter years of her"], [599, "THE ORIGIN OF PURITANISM. 577 reign, was always associated in the mind of the puri- bookx. tans with the presence of men who had flaunted these c^p_1' popish habits before them. The monk's hood and the priest's robe were emblems of an execrated tyranny, and they were execrated accordingly. Elizabeth was bound to Brotestantism by circum- Elizabeth stances, and no doubt by conviction ; but the crucifix pSitans'. e and the altar lights in her chapel, betrayed a sympathy with the symbol and pomp of the Boman worship, which Edward, and the reformers generally in his time, would have looked upon with surprise and ap prehension. Many a puritan felt, that in the presence of such tendencies in such a quarter, it became him to be resolved in lifting up his testimony on the side of a purer worship. Hence, as the disposition to enforce conformity became stronger, the duty of resistance seemed to become more imperative. The changes made in the rubric as left by Edward Rubric VI. were not considerable, but they were in no in- ward and stance in favour of the puritans. On the contrary, it EUzabeth was now strictly enjoined, that the communicants should all kneel in partaking of the Lord's supper ; and not only the surplice, but the copes, and other garments, which had been dispensed with in the se cond service book by Cranmer, were restored.* The queen also issued a series of injunctions, through Elizabeths , -1.. iii \u25a0 11 \u25a0 j. i_ \u25a0 injunctions her commissioners, to determine everything to be in- on ecciesi cluded in the future order of the public service. These injunctions contained many wholesome provisions, and they suggest much in regard to the state of religion at the time. They require that all ecclesiastical per sons shall preach four times in the year against yield ing obedience to any foreign jurisdiction ; that every incumbent shall preach once a month on the works of faith, mercy, and charity ; that images, relics, paint ings, and all things used to superstitious purposes, shall be destroyed; that within three months every Strype, Annals, i. 119 et seq.

The whole of these articles, fifty-three in number, were to be read in the church four times in the year.* In the convocation of 1562, an attempt was made to place the service of the church at a greater remove from the medi\u00e6val form. One paper presented, enumerated all the matters to which objection had been made by the puritans, and prayed for their removal. This paper was signed by thirty-three members, of whom eight were deans, and twelve were archdeacons. Another paper, less comprehensive in its exceptions, became the subject of much discussion. In this docu ment it was urged, that the cross in baptism should be omitted ; that kneeling at the sacrament should not be enforced ; that organs should be removed ; and that from the former habits of ministers, the surplice only * Strype, Annals, i. 235-242. Sparrow, Collections."], [601, "THE ORIGIN OF PURITANISM. 579 should be retained. The majority of the members book x. present were in favour of this measure of reform. The C\"AT' '' votes were forty-three against thirty-five. But when the proxies came to be counted, the proposal was lost by a majority of one, the numbers being fifty-nine against fifty-eight. From such expressions of opinion, we may safely conclude, that had the will of the queen been known to be favourable to change in that direc tion, the houses of convocation at that time would not have left ground for complaint to any sober-minded puritan.* But in 1564, six years after Elizabeth's accession, The puritan ,-1 . f. . , ..-,-. -.. ,-, .. ministers do the uniformity enjoined by parliament, by convocation, notcon and by the queen's commissioners, was but indifferently form observed. The best educated, and most earnest men, among the parochial clergy, were almost everywhere opposed to the strictness of the course pursued by the queen and her instruments, and they knew the feeling of their congregations to be generally with them. Some ministers fixed the communion table in the chancel, some removed it to other parts of the church ; some dressed the table in one manner, some in another ; some administered baptism in a font, some with a basin ; some used the sign of the cross, and others not ; some officiated ' in a surplice, others with ' out ; some with a square cap, some with a round cap, ' some with a button cap, some with a hat ; some in ' scholars' clothes, some in others. 't When this state of affairs was duly reported to the \"ore queen, her majesty was not a little displeased. The meamrea archbishop of Canterbury and the archbishop of York are ,akeB were instructed to confer with their suffragans on the measures to be taken to ensure conformity from the existing clergy, and to restrict admission to the bene fices of the church to persons known to be ' well dis ' posed to the common order,' and ready to promise * Strype, Annals, i. c. 29. t Strype, Annals, ii. c. 41.

But the bishops, and the members of the council, were divided in feeling on this subject ; and so serious were the probable consequences of such rigour, that Elizabeth herself alternated in her purpose. Bemonstrances came from many quarters. From this time, however, the policy of the queen may be said to have been determined, and the bishops who had been disposed to a more liberal course became sensible, that if they were to retain their office, and if evils of another and a graver description, probably, were to be avoided, it became them to see that the irregularities which had been hitherto tolerated should come to an end. To thoughtful men in our time, nothing seems more clear than that there was an excess of scrupulousness in the feeling of the puritan. But this weakness, if weakness it must be called, had its root in principles which were of much significance. The question to be settled was a question of authority ; and it was hardly possible to discuss that question in relation to eccle siastical affairs, without entering upon considerations affecting the ground of authority in general. The memorable speculations touching social liberty which were to become so conspicuous under the House of Stuart, came largely from seeds which had been ger minating in the minds of the puritans through the long reign of Elizabeth. With this class of her majesty's subjects, resistance to the undue exercise of power sprang from motives of special force. The feeling which prompted them to speak and act, had respect, not to the interests of this world, so much as to the sanctions of the next. The conscience of the puritan was something more than the conscience necessary to the good citizen. It was the conscience which makes the saint and the martyr. The terrors of earthly power might be great, but the terror above the earthly was much greater. If restraint was to be laid upon the imperial will of the lady on the throne, it could be only by such men. The frown of Eliza-"], [603, "581 THE ORIGIN OF PURITANISM. beth might awe courtiers into submission ; but to the book x. genuine puritan, it was as sunshine compared with the Chap' '' frown of the Almighty. The points of difference which lay at the foundation The points of the controversy between the puritans and the court troentne clergy may be stated in few words. By the latter class two partie8, of reformers it was said, that the prince has autho rity to determine personally, or by sanction from the state, what shall be the belief and usage of the church within his own dominions; and that during the minority of the sovereign this authority devolves upon his coun cil. The council in the time of Edward acted upon this latter doctrine. Mary exercised a power of the same kind, doing many things on her accession without wait ing for the consent of parliament. Elizabeth followed her example in this respect, and aimed to perpetuate that exceptional authority through her Court of High Commission. But the puritans, while sternly reject ing the supremacy of the pope, were far from ceding this large power to the crown. The injunction \u2014 let all things be done decently and in order, must, they said, have been addressed to the people, or to their ministers, it could not have been addressed to princes or magistrates. The notion which would make the faith and worship of a whole nation depend upon a single will, they repudiated as servile and absurd. Further \u2014 the court clergy continued to recognise the Church of Bome as a true church ; her ministry as valid ; her sacraments as efficacious ; and the pope himself as a Christian bishop. But the puritan would cede none of these things. He did not deny that there might be pious Bomanists, but he maintained that piety in such instances existed rather in defiance of the system than by means of it. The New Testament, said many of our early Be formers, furnishes small information concerning mat ters of discipline or worship, nearly all things of that nature being left to be regulated and settled in Chris tian states by the authorities to which such states are"], [604, "582 ANGLICANS AND PURITANS. BOOK X, Chap. i. subject. But the puritans accepted the scriptures as their standard both of doctrine and discipline, and affirmed that nothing should be accepted as Christian for which that authority could not be adduced, either directly or indirectly, and that any less important matters which the scriptures may have left doubtful, should be referred, not to the authorities of the state, but to the pastors of the church. In accordance with these views, the ruling church men in those times deemed it enough to be able to cite the belief or practice of the first four or five centuries in their defence, while the puritans restricted their appeal to the sacred writings, and to the apostolic age. They would not be bound by any later or less certain authority. Finally, while many taught that things neither commanded nor forbidden in scripture, and which for that reason were named indifferent, might be adopted and enforced by the royal authority \u2014 the puritan in sisted that no human authority could be warranted in making things necessary which had not been so made by the teaching or example of the inspired writers ; and that least of all might that be done in things connected with religion by an authority essentially secular. When reminded that the shape of a cap or the fashion of a robe was a trivial thing, the answer was, that if the thing was a trifle, then why not leave it as such to the individual conscience ? But were these things trivial? Had they not been the badge of men whose worship was not only grossly superstitious, but abso lutely idolatrous, and of men whose rule had been so lately stained in the face of the whole country with the blood of the innocent ?

J J fault m the der conscience too much after the manner of the queen scheme of and her bishops. If the Erastian Act of Uniformity unsPuri\" under Elizabeth had not come into existence, there would have been a puritan act of that nature, which in many respects would have been not a whit less rigid. It would have been based avowedly on the authority of the apostolic age, and not on any later age ; and the teaching of the apostolic age would have been interpreted by the ministers of religion rather than by ministers of state ; but the result would have been a fixed polity, discipline, and ritual, to which the indi vidual conscience would not have been allowed to take exception. The aid of the magistrate would have been invoked, but it would have been, after the old popish fashion, to enforce the decisions of the clergy, not his own decisions. Concerning religious doctrine, there was no material difference between the puritans and their opponents. The most desirable course, as regarded the nation at what eu, o zabeth large, would perhaps have been, that Elizabeth should might have have left the obnoxious ceremonies optional \u2014 optional under certain circumstances according to law \u2014 or that she should have consented to their entire removal. No danger would have ensued from either policy : and in either case, the bitterness gendered in the early stages of this controversy, which prepared men for extending it to graver differences, might have been avoided One word from the queen would have sufficed to this end. Bomanists were not to be conciliated by the retention of such things.

ARCHBISHOB BABKEB, on receiving the queen's letter complaining of irregularity in the services of the church, and insisting on conformity, wrote without delay to the bishops, urging them to show themselves obedient to the will of her majesty, with all possible promptitude. The London clergy had been conspicuous in their neglect of the orders which had been issued by Elizabeth and her commissioners. They were now summoned, reasoned with, and those who were not to be moved by such influences, were menaced with the loss of their livings. Many promised obedience ; but thirty refused submission, and it was observed that most of these were able preachers, and well-educated men. Within the next three months, many of these men were excluded from their cures and silenced. Among the clergy subjected to this ordeal were Dr. Lawrence Humphrey, head of Christ Church, Ox ford ; and Dr. Thomas Sampson, head of Magdalen. Both were men of eminent worth and learning, and held in high and general estimation. But neither could promise to use the prescribed apparel. They invoked the opinion of the Zurich divines, Bullinger and Gaulter, on the question. The answer of those learned men was, that the retention of the obnoxious garments was much to be deprecated, but that good men would do well to conform to the use of them, rather than see their official influence pass into un worthy hands. Such was the opinion of Zurich, but Geneva was of another judgment.

Humphrey and Sampson lived to the year 1589. Cecil prevailed on Humphrey to become a conformist. But Sampson could not free himself from his scruples. He was deprived of his official status, and lived some twenty years a poor man.* Towards the close of 1565, this controversy produced Puritanism a great excitement in the University of Cambridge, bridge. The fellows and students in St. John's College, and in Trinity College, were almost to a man on the side of the puritans. Dr. Longford, the master of St. John's, was to be absent from the college for a season ; and his absence, as appeared afterwards, was not uninten tional. On a certain day, some three hundred col legians appeared in chapel without hood or sur plice, and some alterations were introduced in the service. The men of Trinity, with three exceptions only, showed themselves to be of one mind with the men of St. John's. Other colleges were, of course, more or less affected. The master of St. John's, on his return, made no complaint about the innovations that had taken place, but allowed affairs to move on in the altered course. Cecil, the chancellor, was soon apprised of what had been done. He wrote letters ex pressing his deep regret, describing the conduct of the innovators as inconsiderate and mischievous, and urg ing them, as they hoped to avoid the heavy displeasure of the queen, to retrace their steps. It is manifest in this correspondence, that Cecil feared the anger of her majesty, if the Cambridge students did not. He dealt in a very peremptory manner with the master of * Strype, Annals, ii. I 25-131, 148-150.

Enough had happened, however, to show the strength which this new cur rent of thought and preference had acquired in the country, and to make it evident that discussion on this subject would not be brought to a speedy settlement. The next year, Cecil found it necessary to write as earnestly as before, to discountenance what he describes as ' the lightness and disorder of youth,' in that vene rable seat of learning.* Four years later, the puritans in Cambridge widened the ground of dispute with the established church. ' Hitherto the quarrel was only about wearing the cap '\u25a0 and the surplice, and such like apparel, and the posture ' in receiving the sacrament ; but now they attempt to ' move another, and a more dangerous matter, in ' assaulting the hierarchy of the church, and disproving ' and condemning the ancient wholesome government ' used in it by archbishops and bishops, deans and ' archdeacons, and other ecclesiastical officers. 'f The great leader in this new movement, was Mr. Thomas Cartwright, a fellow of Trinity College. Cartwright was a man of learning and energy, and so great was his influence, even while avowing such opinions, that he was elected to be divinity reader in the chair founded by the lady Margaret. Crowds gathered about him. The pulpits of the town echoed his doctrines. Tracts and fly-sheets were scattered abroad, full of the freest criticism on the character of the hierarchy, and on the exercise of the royal autho rity in relation to it.

The next step, it was said, of men who seek a parity among officers in the church, will be to seek a similar parity in the state. But Cartwright and his friends did not leave their case to be reported by their opponents. They were careful to submit it to the chancellor in their own words. Cecil, having the matter thus before him from the showing of both sides, delivered his judgment, but did so with much caution and moderation.* Cart wright was admonished to abstain from such re flections on the established order of things in his future reading and preaching. But this light penalty, as it was deemed, did not at all satisfy the enemies of that bold innovator. Dr. Whitgift, master of Trinity, whitgift. had been strenuously opposed to him, and now, in his capacity of vice-chancellor, went so far as to prohibit his reading at all, and, in the end, excluded him from his fellowship. Cecil was prevailed upon to express his approval of these proceedings, and in this manner Cartwright was confirmed in his antagonism to the hierarchy, and especially to Whitgift. f While the men of Cambridge gave such signs of The pur.' discontent, the deprived ministers in London were not don\u2014 first silent. In the year after they were excluded from 5epajs6?n' their churches, more than one book was published in vindication of their conduct. In this year, Jewel, bishop of Salisbury, writing to Bulbnger, says in behalf of himself and of his old companions in exile, bishops Barkhurst, Sandys, and Bilkington, that they ' wished all footsteps of popery might be removed, ' both out of the churches, and out of the minds of * Strype, ii. 377, 378. t Ibid. iii. 1-5.

That was all !"], [610, "588 ANGLICANS AND PURITANS. BOOK X Chap. z. The begin nings of separation Conventi cles forbid den. ' men; but the queen would hear of no change.' No man knew the mind of the queen on this subject better than archbishop Barker ; but while his personal judgment is known to have been very much that of Jewel and his brother bishops, he was zealous in seeing that an answer to the argument which the London ministers had set forth should not be wanting.* In this manner the queen and the primate brought on the first separation of ordained clergymen, with their congregations, from the established Church. Many of the deprived ministers began the practice of medicine. Some turned to other secular employ ments. But there were those who preferred to retain their office, and to exercise it in secret, not a few belong ing to their former charge being earnestly disposed to avail themselves of their spiritual services. The queen looked with some apprehension on this movement, and issued injunctions, in her own name and in the name of the council, prohibiting the laity from meeting in conventicles for religious worship. Bersons becoming thus disobedient were to be deprived of ' the freedom of the city, and to abide what should ' follow.'f Meetings of this description, however, were frequent, and the sacraments were sometimes administered in them. But they were commonly meetings in private houses. So long as they were thus limited and quiet it was not easy to detect them. It was felt, moreover, that to meddle with them would be very unpopular. Custom in such things gives courage. In the summer of 1567, a number of nonconformists hired the Plumbers' Hall, on the plea of holding a wedding festival, but, in reality, for con ducting one of their religious services. The city sheriffs and their officers came to the door and de manded admission. They found about a hundred persons present, and some fourteen or fifteen from * Strype, Parker, i. 420 et seq.

On the following day, these persons Chap' z' were placed before the lord mayor, Grindal, the bishop of London, and the queen's commissioners, and were interrogated concerning their meeting. The resent ment of the separatists under this treatment was bitter, even rude, and seemed to prognosticate worse things to come.* While the scruples of the puritans, both in minis- Puritans in ters and laymen, were leading to these results in some par ao quarters, the influence of this party through the country was strongly reflected in the proceedings of parliament. The first marked indication of this feeling is in the parliament of 1566. The two houses then presented a petition to the queen, praying her majesty to marry, and to adopt measures for the settlement of the crown in the event of her dying without issue. The queen of Scots had recently given birth to a son. The Bomanists were hoping to see the crown settled on the Scottish queen and her offspring ; and the more zealous Brotestants, especially the puritans, were quite as solicitous that the sove reignty should not pass in that direction. Who should be named as next in succession, was a difficunvy, and the difference of opinion on that point only served to show the importance of settling the question on the best authority possible. The nearest claimants, exclusive of the queen of The queen Scots, were the countess of Lenox, a daughter of marry.

This kind of reply gave no satisfaction to the more zealous members of the lower house. It was urged by Wentworth, Bell, and others, who were leading men among the puritans, that the strength of sovereigns consisted in the loyalty of their subjects, and that no prince should calculate on that loyalty while neglecting the duties necessary to the tranquillity and safety of the state. So bold did they become, as to say, that the queen, by slighting their wishes in this important matter, ' would be rather a step-mother to ' her country, or something worse, than the nursing ' mother thereof: \u2014 as being seemingly desirous that ' England, which lived as it were in her, should rather ' expire with her, than survive or out-last her. That ' none but timorous princes, or such as were hated by ' their people, or faint-hearted women, did ever stand ' in fear of their successors.'* Great, we are told, was the liberty of speech on this occasion. Great, too, was the displeasure of the queen. To put a check upon this licence, her majesty com manded thirty members of the commons to appear before her, along with a committee of the lords. Elizabeth's address to the culprits was highly charac teristic. She rebuked them and flattered them by turns ; and as a large subsidy had been granted, in the expectation that the petition touching her marriage would be successful, she softened her expression of hesitancy on that question, by declining to take more than a part of the sum voted, adding, that, to her, ' money in the purses of her subjects was as good as ' money in her exchequer.' In her speech on the dis solution of this parliament her majesty returned to this disquieting topic, and in terms which showed that she was still ill at ease, in the remembrance of what had happened. She hinted something about persons * Camden, ad ann. D'Ewes' Journal."], [613, "591 HISTORY OF PURITANISM. who in the business of the session had worn two faces, bookx. and had hoped to do her mischief, by breeding dis- _^p_2 trust and disaffection between herself and her com mons. The talk of these persons was about ' Succession ' and Liberty,' and one good thing had come of it \u2014 her friends had been distinguished from her enemies. The house of commons, in this parliament, said the queen, seems to have consisted of four classes \u2014 the secret movers of unwise discussions, who are the most to blame ; the great talkers on such matters, who are the next in fault ; the credulous persons who allow themselves to be influenced by eloquent tales ; and those who listen, wonder, do not approve, but are mute, for whom most excuse might be made.* So the queen's friends in those ' Succession and Liberty' disputes, seem to have consisted of persons who would gladly have suppressed the freedom of their colleagues, but who knew themselves to be so few, or so feeble, that they had not the courage to avow their opinions. Five years passed before Elizabeth convened her parliament next parliament. During those years the conspiracies os ,571' of Spain and France against this country had been closely watched; the treasonable intrigues of the queen of Scots had been detected ; the duke of Nor folk had been sent to the Tower ; and the rebellion in the north under the earls of Northumberland and Westmoreland, had been suppressed. The queen opened this parliament in person, and in great splen dour. According to the speech of the lord keeper, one part of its business was to see what needed to be done concerning the laws and discipline of the church \u2014 matters on which the judgment of the bishops should be particularly consulted. The speaker of the commons, in his address to the queen, prayed that certain privileges might be granted to the lower house, particularly that its members should 'all have free ' speech' in their deliberations.

The queen, as head of the church, with the Court of High Commission, came thus into the place of the parlia ment on such questions. But the puritans were slow to admit that so much had been ceded."], [615, "HISTORY OF PURITANISM. 593 ' yet are there some things inserted which are more book x.

This ' ancient man' is said to have spoken at large concerning the abuses of the church of England, and the faults of the churchmen. He complained that known papists were admitted to livings, and to places of authority, while deserving men, honest and godly protestants, were left to poverty and obscurity ; that boys, and incompetent persons, were often inducted to cures, and pluralism was shamefully tolerated. His motion therefore was, ' that by authority of the house, * some convenient number of them might be assigned, ' to have conference with the lords of the spiritualty ' for the consideration and reformation of such matters.' This motion was carried, and a committee was ap pointed, including, with other names, all the members of the privy council having seats in that house. But on the next day, Mr. Strickland was summoned Strickland J . . under re to appear before the council, and after some question- straint ing, was commanded to abstain from resuming his place in the commons until the pleasure of the govern- him back. ment concerning him should be further known. His friends, however, were in no mood to submit to this stretch of power. ' Mr. Carleton, with a very good ' zeal, and an orderly show of obedience, made signifi- ' cation, that a member of the house was detained ' from them, by whose commandment, or for what ' cause, he knew not. But forasmuch as he was not ' now a private person, but especially chosen to supply ' the room, person, and place of a multitude, he thought ii U"], [616, "594 ANGLICANS AND PURITANS. BOOK X, Chap. z. Yelverton, ' that neither in regard of the country which was not ' to be wronged, nor for the liberty of the house, which ' was not to be infringed, should they permit him to ' be detained from them. But, whatsoever the intend- ' ment of his offence might be, that he should be sent ' for to the bar of that house, there to be heard, and ' there to answer.' The lord treasurer and the comp- troller endeavoured to check the storm thus rising, by assuring the house that no harsh course had been taken towards the absent member ; that his offence had not been in what he had said, but in introducing a bill which trenched on her majesty's prerogative ; and that the crown had interfered in times past, both in regard to measures and speeches, in a much greater degree. Mr. Arnold replied, ' with some vehemency,' that if it became them to remember her majesty's prero- gative, it became them also to remember the liberty due to the house of commons. Were he not to say thus much he should fall under the censure of his own conscience, which he feared much more than any offence else- where. Two members spoke in favour of the claim of the crown ; but Mr. Yelverton, a lawyer, and a man of mark in the parliaments of this reign, rose and demanded that Mr. Strickland should be restored to his place. Such a precedent, he alleged, would be most perilous, if once ceded. What use might be made of it by arbitrary princes no one could foresee. Surely the crown could not be allowed to give law, in this manner, to the parliament, while the authority of parliament was such that it could dispose of the crown. To deny that supremacy to the English par liament was high treason. ' He remembered that ' men are not there for themselves, but for their coun- ' tries. He showed it was fit for princes to have their ' prerogatives ; but yet the same to be straitened ' within reasonable limits ; the prince, he showed, ' could not of herself make laws, neither might she ' by the same reason break laws. He further said, ' that the speech uttered in that place, and the offer"], [617, "595 HISTORY OF PURITANISM. ' made of the bill, was not to be condemned as evil ; book x: ' for that if there were anything in the Book of Com- Chap z' ' mon Brayer, either Jewish, Turkish, or Bopish, the ' same was to be reformed.' While these bold sayings were reverberating through the house, the members of the council present were seen whispering together. Bresently, the Speaker expressed his desire that the debate should proceed no further. The next day Strickland was again in his place, ' to the no small 'joy of his brethren.'* In the parliament of the next year, more than one Parliament message came to the commons prohibiting their pro- \u00b0 ceedings, as embracing matters not proper to be taken up by parliament without permission from the crown. One of the measures thus interdicted, related to the cere monies of the church ; the other, to the course which Elizabeth should be urged to take towards the Scottish queen. The puritan members murmured deeply among themselves under this restraint. No good, they said, could come from a session thus speech-bound ; nor could parliaments be of any real value if to be thus checked and coerced by another power. But there * D'Ewes, Journal, 156\u2014176. There was a discussion in this parlia ment on a bill to enforce attendance at church, which deserves notice on two accounts, \u2014 as showing that in 157 1 there were many churches in which the minister made little or no use of the Prayer-book ; and that even that venerable senator, Mr. Strickland, needed to be much enlightened on his favourite topic \u2014 liberty of conscience. ' In many places,' it is said, ' no part of the prayers [in the Prayer-book] was observed, but a sermon , and some such other prayers only as the minister shall think good, in place thereof; whereupon great divisions, discords, and dislikes have grown between great numbers.' Mr. Aglionby, burgess for Warwick, would have persons obliged to attend church, but not to go to the communion, which would be to strain conscience. Mr. Strickland replied, that the Israelites were constrained to eat the passover, and that to compel persons to com mune ' was no straining of their consciences, but a charge or loss of their goods, if they could not vouchsafe to be, as they should be, good men, and true Christians' !\u2014 D'Ewes, 161.

Q Q 2"], [618, "596 ANGLICANS AND PURITANS. BOOK X Chap. z. Parliament of 1575\u2014 Went worth's speech. were circumstances which inclined the house to submit for the moment to this invasion of its liberty. On the first day, however, in the history of the next parliament, this suppressed feeling obtained strong utterance, in a memorable speech from the puritan lawyer, Beter Wentworth. He said that since the dissolution of the last parliament, his conscience had not ceased to upbraid him with his cowardice, in that he had not lifted up his voice against the treatment to which the commons were then subjected. In prospect of the meeting of another parliament he had resolved to acquit himself honestly on this whole matter, and he had so resolved in full foresight of the penalty he might incur by so doing. He gave expression to his loyalty, as the puritans generally did, in impassioned terms \u2014 but he ventured to say, that even the queen might err, and that she had erred, in not so trusting her faithful commons as to have left them to the use of their ancient and proper freedom. Nothing could be more certain than that subjects must be accounted trustworthy, if they are to be found affectionate and loyal. The house of commons consisted of men who were deputed to concern themselves with everything affecting the interests of church or state. To abridge its liberty, was to abridge the liberty of the whole state ; and the things which were highest in their own nature, were the things with which they were the most bound to occupy themselves. To expect that the interests of the church would be served, by leaving them entirely, or mainly, in the hands of the spiritualty, was to expect, according to Mr. Wentworth's judgment, against nature and ex perience. ' I have heard,' said this stern senator, ' from old parliament men, that the banishment of the ' pope and popery, and the restoring of true religion, ' had their beginning from this house, and not from ' the bishops ; and I do surely think, before God I ' speak it, that the bishops were the cause of that dole ' ful message [forbidding discussion on the ceremonies"], [619, "HISTORY OF PURITANISM. 597 BOOKX, Chap. z. ' bill] ; and I will show you what moves me to think ' so. I was, amongst others, in the last parliament, ' sent to the archbishop of Canterbury, about the ' articles of religion which then passed this house. He ' asked us, why we did put out of the book the articles ' for the homilies, consecrating of bishops, and such 1 like ? Surely, sir, said I, because we were so occupied ' in other matters, that we had no time to examine ' them, how far they agree with the word of God. ' What, said he, surely you mistook the matter, you ' will defer wholly to us therein ? No, by the faith I ' bear to God, said I, we will pass nothing before we ' understand what it is ; for that were to make you ' popes \u2014 make you popes who list, said I, we will ' make you none.' So unusual were the terms in which Wentworth expressed himself, especially in re lation to the interference of the queen with the liberty of the house, that he was placed in the custody of the serjeant-at-arms, and a committee of the house was appointed to consider his words. But he recanted nothing. His speech, he told the committee, had been written three months before. What he had said had been said advisedly. If a message, he continued, sent to the house shall ' be against the glory of God, ' against the prince's safety, or against the liberty of ' this house, whereby the state is maintained, I neither ' may nor will hold my peace. I cannot in so doing ' discharge my conscience, whosoever doth send it. ' And I say that I heartily repent me for that 1 have ' hitherto held my peace in these causes ; and I do pro ' mise you all, if God forsake me not, that I will never, ' during my life, hold my tongue, if any message be ' sent wherein God is dishonoured, the prince perilled, ' or the liberty of parliament impeached ; and every ' one of you here ought to repent of these faults, and to ' amend them.' Wentworth was lodged in the Tower. But three days afterwards, the queen sent Mr. Chris topher Hatton to the commons to say, that notwith standing she had so much ground for being displeased"], [620, "598 ANGLICANS AND PURITANS. BOOK X, Chap. z. Subsequent parlia- ments, New policy of the puri tans. with the imprisoned member, she forbore to concern herself with his case, and left his enlargement wholly to the discretion of the house. This communication was received with applause, and the house felt that Wentworth had done the state some service.* Seven parliaments were convened during the reign of Elizabeth after this parliament of 1575. In all these there was a recurrence, more or less, of the scenes above described. The commons persisted in making speeches, and in introducing bills, on ecclesiastical affairs, and the queen was not less pertinacious in rebuking them, and in claiming that the ordering of all such matters should be left to herself and her bishops. But the commons were wise in their gene ration. They knew that every agitation of such questions had its uses, even when their measures, though carried, did not become law. The queen was always firm in the assertion of her alleged prerogative, and the puritans in the commons were equally firm in asserting the ancient liberty of par liament.! Down to 1575, seventeen years after the queen's accession, the great majority of the puritan ministers were comparatively moderate and cautious men, and were to be found within the pale of the established church. But experience had taught even these to despair of any concession from the queen, from archbishop Barker, or from the commission court. It was seen that their friends in parliament could make themselves heard ; and that their friends in the privy council might be expected to do them service ; and from this time their hope had respect mainly to the assistance that might be obtained in those quarters. They knew, also, that even among the prelates, there was a considerable division of opinion, some being much more disposed to tolerate manifestations of a puritan feeling than others. No immediate change * D'Ewes, Journal, 236\u2014244. t Parl. Hist. i. 609-955.

The clergy of the town of Northampton were the t^f\"fZa\" first to move under an impulse of this nature. With ei^gy and the sanction of their diocesan, of the mayor of the Nonha'mp town, and of the local magistrates, the ministers of ton- Northampton resolved, that in the ordinary services of the church, the Book of Common Brayer shoidd be duly used \u2014 but that there should be a psalm before and after sermon, to be sung by the congregation v, ithout the use of the organ ; that on Tuesday and Thursday there should be a lecture, from nine to ten in the morning, in the principal church of the town, which should be preceded with the confession of sin only from the Brayer-book, and be followed by a prayer and a confession of faith ; that on every Sun day and holiday, there should be a sermon after this manner, at such an hour, that the people, after attend ing the usual church service, might attend this supple mentary service ; that once a quarter there should be a communion service, from five o'clock in the morning to eight for servants, and from nine to twelve for masters and mistresses ; that this service should be according to the Brayer-book, except that the people should rise from confession in their pews, and approach the communion table in companies, the minister reading in the pulpit ; that the minister should visit his parishioners a fortnight before the communion, to reconcile such as might be at variance, and to urge a devout observance of the institution ; that order should be taken to ensure a regular catechising of the young on the Lord's day; and that no idle or indecorous conduct should be allowed in the town on that day during the hours of service. The ministers and magistrates of Northampton must have had reason to conclude that the people would generally concur in this scheme, and be ready"], [622, "600 ANGLICANS AND PURITANS. BOOK X Chap. z. Associa tions for prophe sying and exposition of Scrip- ture. Prejudice raised against them. to avail themselves of such means of edification. What was true in this respect of Northampton, would be true, we have reason to think, of most towns in Eng land ; and if so, then the contest of Elizabeth with the puritans would seem to have been little less than a contest with the nation, or at least with a very large portion of its town populations.* But these ministers of Northampton were not con tent with seeking the edification of their people, they instituted an organization among themselves with a special view to their own improvement. The clergy, not only of the town, but of the whole county, were invited to meet once a quarter, when three persons previously named were to engage in what was called an ' exercise,' which consisted in the exposition and application of a text. The first speaker might occupy three quarters of an hour, the other two, who were to supplement or correct what the first had said, were not to exceed a quarter of an hour each. The people who were thus far to be auditors, were then dismissed, and the presiding clergyman called upon the brethren generally to deliver their judgment concerning what had passed, stating in writing such objections as they wished should be answered at the next meeting. The freedom assumed in these discussions became known in those days as the ' Liberty of Brophesying ;' and the custom was founded on the text \u2014 ' Ye may all ' prophesy [elucidate, interpret], one by one, that all ' may learn, and all be comforted. 'f In the course of the next two or three years, meet ings of this nature became common in many parts of England, especially in Norfolk and the northern counties. The more learned among the clergy, and the most popular preachers, were generally the lead ing men in these exercises. Their tendency was, no doubt, to qualify the younger preachers to deal more effectually with the arguments of the seminary priests * Strype, Ann. ii. ad an. 1571. y 1 Cor. xiv. 30."], [623, "HISTORY OF PURITANISM. 601 and the Jesuits, and to expound the scriptures generally book x. with greater readiness and ability. crav.z. But Barker appears to have regarded them as so Tbe qupen many normal schools of puritanism and disaffection, declare In 1574, the primate became very zealous in his efforts ti^m.9* to suppress them, and though opposed by the council, March 25. with the aid of the queen he carried his object.* Barker died while thus employed. He was a man ue\u00bb\u00ab> \u00b0f of energy and courage, and of some political sagacity. In his view, the church ceremonies which proved to be so objectionable to the puritans in the early years of his primacy, were small matters. He often said that he cared little or nothing about them. But there must be order in such things ; the queen preferred this order ; and it became him to see that the queen was obeyed, f In acting upon this policy, however, he found himself exposed to much resistance, and to many hard speeches, which evidently affected his temper, so that his aversion to the puritans, and his disposition to uphold Elizabeth in the extreme, and even in illegal, exercises of her prerogative, became more manifest as he grew older. He stood so much alone in pursuing this course, that looking at his career as a whole, it is not surprising that small affection should have been shown towards his memory in any quarter, and that he should have been very unpopular with the puritans. His learning, and his disposition to encourage learning, were his best qualities. On this last ground he is entitled to much praise. But in his administration as primate, the Christian edification of the people seemed to be Uttle regarded, compared with their being taught to be quiet and submissive. Such was Elizabeth's way of thinking, and the archbishop was content to become the instrument of her pleasure. * Strype, Parker, ii. 258-262. f ' Doth your lordship think, as he went on, that I care for cap, tippet, surplice, or wafer-bread, or any such ?

BOOK X Chap. z. 1575 Dec. 20, Barker was succeeded by Grindal, a man whose views concerning the function of the Christian mi nister were of another, and of a much better kind. Grindal encouraged the attempts which were made to revive the meetings for ' prophesying,' and hoped to disarm prejudice against them by placing them under restrictions which seemed to preclude the possible appearance of disorder. But he was disappointed. On his coming to court, Elizabeth, we are told, ' de ' clared herself offended at the number of preachers, ' as well as at the exercises, urging that it was good ' for the church to have few preachers, that three ' or four in a county might suffice, and that the ' reading of homilies to the people was enough.'* The archbishop wrote to her majesty on these topics. He regarded the exercises, not only as harmless, but as highly beneficial. f The want of more able preachers was, in his judgment, the great want of the church. The reading of homilies was a sorry substitute for such preaching. In conclusion, the good man declared that, as archbishop, he must be allowed to act con scientiously, and that he could not consent to act upon the views of the queen on those points. The letter is a noble one, discussing all these topics largely and freely, j But Elizabeth was neither convinced nor softened by it. She suppressed ' the prophesyings.' The archbishop himself was put under restraint, was sequestered, and remained thus disgraced until 1582, the year of his death. * Strype, Grindal, 329. t Lord Bacon describes the proceedings of these meetings, as ' a good exercise,' and regrets their being put down ' against the advice and opinion of one of the greatest and gravest prelates of this land.' ' It was in my opinion the best way to frame and train up preachers to handle the word of God as it ought to be handled, that hath been practised. For we see orators have their declamations, lawyers have their moots, logicians their sophisms, and every practice of science hath an exercise of erudition and initiation before men come to the life ; only preaching, which is the wor thiest, and wherein it is more danger to do amiss, wanteth an introduction, and is ventured and rushed upon at the first.' \u2014 Pacification of the Church of England : Works, vi. 61 et seq.

This work set JlfjjJ' forth a scheme of polity, discipline, and worship, such as the more advanced puritans were desirous of seeing parliament. established. It was the production of various hands. The two ministers who presented it to parliament were sent to Newgate. But the book found its way to the public through the press. Great effort was made to discover the printer, and to suppress the publi cation \u2014 but in vain. In less than two years, four editions of the work were put into circulation.* In 1583, Whitgift became primate. The see of Can terbury was twenty years in his hands, which brings us to the death of Elizabeth. Three facts are ob servable as characteristic of his administration. The attempts to enforce conformity became more stringent and unscrupulous than ever ; the result, both among separatists and among the conforming clergy, was an increase of discontent ; and so the feeling of sympa thy with such men, became stronger and more general, both among the people, and among the gentry and nobles, not excepting the distinguished men nearest about the person of the queen. In Whitgilt, Eliza beth found an archbishop of Canterbury after her own heart. But the result of their conjoint rule must have been a growing mortification to both. One of the new primate's first acts was to issue a The new series of ' Articles,' more severely intolerant towards P\"uesnew the puritans than anything of the kind hitherto article8 published.

The storm raised by these articles was the natural prelude to much that followed. Great numbers of ministers in Kent, Sussex, Suffolk, Essex, Lincoln, and other counties, were suspended. The people and gentry in those districts became loud in their complaints. The members of the council remon strated. But the primate was skilled in the means of self-defence. He could reckon on the support of the queen, and was not to be readily turned from his course.* But no part of Whitgift' s rule was more generally condemned than his determination to examine his victims by means of the e\u00e6-officio oath. This form of proceeding had been retained from the old Bomanist times. It required suspected persons to bind them selves by oath to answer the questions that might be put to them, and so to convict themselves and others * Strype, Whitgift, i. 123 et seq. The remonstrance from the council was signed by eight persons, including the names of Burleigh, Walsingham, Leicester, Hatton, Shrewsbury, Howard, Warwick, and Croft. It is said that these persons were influenced by ex-parte evidence. But that is hardly probable, certainly not in any great measure. The bias of Sir Christopher Hatton was by no means with men who made a difficulty about conformity. In 1582, the English Bomanists at Bheims sent forth their famous Bhemist Testament \u2014 an English translation of the New Testament, with annotations, &c. \u2014 which found wide circulation in this country. Walsing ham urged Cartwright to expose the errors of this work, and furnished him with money for the purpose. But Whitgift interdicted the puritan from so doing. The increase of Bomanism, it seems, was less to be appre hended, than the seeds of puritanism which would probably find their way into a reply from that quarter. Such facts reveal the temper of the times. \u2014 Strype, Whitgift, i. 482-484. Annals, iii. 287-290.

Bersons refusing to take CHAr' z' this oath, he maintained, deserved to be punished for such refusal.* The candid reader will not need that more should be said to illustrate the temper of the ecclesiastical domination to which England was subject during the twenty years which preceded the accession of James I. The state of parties bequeathed to the Stuarts by this policy is well known. It was greatly to the honour of the puritans, that in general, they resolutely refused to take this oath. In 1588, the meetings for prophesying, which had The clergy always been for the most part public, and had embraced classical laity and clergy, were succeeded by classical and pro- meetins3 vincial assemblies, which were convened in secret, and restricted to ministers. Whitgift appears to have looked on the clergy who conformed under his harsh discipline as converted ; but he now discovered, that these local assemblies consisted mainly of the conform ist clergy \u2014 men who submitted for the present to the terms exacted from them, but did so in the fervent hope of seeing better days. In these conferences, all the ecclesiastical questions then agitated were freely discussed, and plans were digested to influence public opinion and feeling in every way possible in favour of puritan opinions. Some of the meetings convened * Strype, Whitgift, i. 318-322.

The Mar prelate tracts. with this view were discovered. The ministers were arrested. Their papers were seized. Cartwright, and many others, were examined in the Star Chamber. But they left their persecutors to obtain evidence by their own means. They would not be bound to convict themselves or other persons. That they wished to see their own platform established was sufficiently mani fest. That they meditated setting it up by force was often charged upon them, but never proved. Their hope was to see opinion come to their side, and to use it in a manner consistent with the law and custom of the realm. The front of their offending consisted in their effort to bring about that consummation ; and in their purpose, we must add, to make their more presbyterian polity as authoritative as the present episcopacy. About the year 1590, the growing bitterness by which this controversy had been long characterized, reached its extreme form in the appearance of the Marprelate tracts.* The authorship of these pro ductions is to this day an unsolved problem in our history \u2014 as much so as the authorship of the Letters of Junius. These publications consist of a series of tracts and treatises, or, as we should now call them, pamphlets ; not all probably by the same hand, but all marked by the same severity and levity of style. Their grand assault is on Whitgift, and on the Court of High Commission. Martin Marprelate made the freest use of wit, humour, sarcasm, and invective, so as to startle the public, and to attract large attention, * Whitgift, some five or six years before this time, had succeeded in giving greater power than ever to the Court of High Commission. Accord ing to an instrument issued in 1584, ' the commissioners were to inquire, not only by the oaths of twelve good and lawful men, but by all other ways and means they could devise, and by the corporal [ex officio'] oath of the accused or suspected persons. Hence it followed, as the commission itself stated, they might fine or imprison at pleasure.' \u2014 Maskell, Martin Mar prelate, 145.

When Elizabeth spoke of Chap 'z' severely punishing all persons who should retain possession of such writings, the earl of Essex is re ported to have said \u2014 ' What, in that case, will your 'majesty do with me?' \u2014 and immediately drew one of the obnoxious tracts from his side-pocket.* All these pieces were printed at a secret press. The press was shifted from place to place with much rapidity. The agents of the government were upon its track as it was removed from Moulsey, near Kingston-upon-Thames, to Fawsley in Northampton shire, and thence to Norton, to Coventry, and to Welstone in Warwickshire, before it was seized near Manchester. f Even that event did not prevent the appearance of more missives of this character. Much pains were taken to implicate the puritans in The puri this rude onslaught upon the rule of the bishops. But implicated Martin himself declared that no man was responsible inUD^sae. for his deeds. He stood alone, and was resolved so to \u00abons. stand. The fact seems to have been, that this man, and the one or two persons who seem to have pursued the same course, had determined not to be shackled by party associations, but to be free to war their own warfare after their own manner. Grave replies to attacks of this nature produced no effect : nor did the commissioners find it possible to lay their hands upon the culprits. While the repudiation of episcopacy was thus Bancroft becoming more violent than ever, Dr. Bancroft, after- tL divine wards bishop of London and archbishop of Canterbury, preached a sermon at St. Baul's Cross, in which he defended episcopacy on the ground of divine right \u2014 a doctrine altogether new in the history of English Brotestantism. Bancroft was an able man, of strong polemical tendencies, and the times were such as to * Maskell, Martin Marprelate, 123, 124. t Paul, Whitgift, 51."], [630, "608 ANGLICANS AND PURITANS. BOOK X CHAP. 2. furnish him with a large measure of genial occupation. We are disposed to think, that the idea of answering the Marprelate tracts after their own manner, originated with Bancroft, and that it was not carried out without his active assistance. Tracts now appeared in which the puritans were assailed in a very ribald and slan derous fashion, and personalities even more irritating were said to be in reserve. It so happened, that the missiles of Marprelate, which had come forth sud denly, ceased as suddenly \u2014 ceased, said his enemies, because he saw himself beaten at his own weapons. But death appears to have silenced Marprelate. We should hope, that to the majority of persons, both among puritans and their opponents, it must have been a sorry matter to have been obliged to listen to men whose language, on both sides, verged so nearly upon Billingsgate, and all this while their professed object was to determine what would be wisest and holiest in the government of the church and the worship of God.* * ' The more discreet and devout sort of men, even of such as were no great friends to the hierarchy, upon solemn debate then resolved (I speak on certain knowledge from the mouths of such whom I must believe), that for many foul falsehoods therein suggested, such books were altogether unbecoming a pious spirit to print, publish, or peruse.' \u2014 Fuller, Church Hist. v. 130. Concerning the literary aspect of this controversy gene rally, Lord Bacon says, ' But in plain truth, I do find, to mine understand ing, these pamphlets (in defence of the hierarchy) as meet to be suppressed as the other. First, because, as the former sort doth deface the government of the church in the persons of the bishops and prelates ; the other doth lead into contempt the exercises of religion in the persons of sundry preachers, so that it disgraceth a higher matter, though in a meaner per son.' \u2014 Advertisement touching the Controversies of the Church of Eng land. Mr. Maskell (Martin Marprelate) has been industrious in his re searches concerning the Marprelate contest, and makes due mention of the services of Nash and others on the anti-puritan side.

The more intolerant course pursued by the High Commission Court from this time, made it an object of increased disaffection in after years, and prepared the way for its fall. As we enter upon the latter half of this reign, we Separatists meet with men who become known under the name of^'j^- Brownists and Barrowists \u2014 men who separate them selves from the established church, not merely, as in the case of the puritans, because the queen's supre macy is not exercised according to their judgment, but because they hold that the province of the magistrate should be limited to purely civil affairs, leaving the religious opinions and usages of the people wholly to their own preference. But if the puritans were accounted such grave offenders, merely because they would have placed some check on the encroachments of the civil power in regard to reli gion, it is easy to imagine the special delinquency that would be made to attach to men who were op posed to all action of that power in regard to that object. Bobert Brown was a clergyman, related to Cecil. R\u00b0h\"t But he was a man of a restless and violent temper, and could do little credit to any cause. He was shielded in a measure by his great kinsman, and after a course of much extravagance and suffering became a conformist.

' If he be showed at Paule's [exhibited by the scholars there], it will cost you fourpence ; at the theatre [in Shoreditch], two pence ; at St. Thomas Waterings, nothing.'

Execution of separa tists. who were blameless in their lives, and manifestly con scientious and devout in their religious profession. It was in vain that these men avowed their loyalty, and their readiness to submit in all civil matters to the authority of the queen. They did not recognise that authority in religion. They would not be bound by it. In common with the puritans, they had no quarrel with the doctrine of the church of England, but they claimed the liberty to reject all things in cluded in it which were not, in their judgment, accordant with scripture. They were reminded that the ecclesiastical supremacy of the crown was settled by statute, as clearly and certainly as its civil supre macy. To question the former, was not more truly sedition than to question the latter. Such, however, was the offence of these sectaries. With them, the magistrate was not the ultimate authority in' religion. That rested with the individual conscience and the Creator. On this ground the men above named were all condemned, sentenced to die, and hanged. To ask for the liberty which our laws have long since guaranteed to our whole people, was to incur that heavy penalty \u2014 to die as the highwayman and the cut-throat dies. So, too often, some must perish in the breach, before the citadel is taken. Barrow was a gentleman of Gray's Inn. Thacker, Copping, and Greenwood, were Brownist ministers. Benry was a native of Wales, had studied in Cam bridge, graduated at Oxford, and is admitted by his enemies to have been a young man of unusual acquire ments, and of deep religious feeling. It should he added, that Barrow and Benry were men of a warm temperament, and sometimes expressed themselves in strong and irreverent language towards the ruling clergy. The only plea in their favour in this respect is, that when men are suffering from hard blows, they will sometimes use hard words. Sectaries multiplied rapidly in the face of all this terror. Sir Walter Baleigh declared in parliament, that the religionists of"], [633, "611 HISTORY OP PURITANISM. this order in Norfolk, and in parts about London, book x. were not less than twenty thousand.* Chap' '' We see, then, that the controversy on religious matters, which the policy of Elizabeth called forth at and the pu the commencement of her reign, continued to the end \" of it, and may be said to have deepened to the last. If resistance to her measures on the part of the Bomanist became weaker, resistance from the discontented among her Brotestant subjects became stronger \u2014 rooted in a wider basis of difference, and in a more resolute temper. Elizabeth regarded her sovereignty as having come to her, not merely from the people of England, but by divine providence, and as being hers by divine right. She often spoke of her authority, especially in relation to the church, in such terms as to show, that in her estimation, opposition to her personal will was opposition to the divine will. The lower range of legislation, concerning tariffs and sub sidies, she could leave to her parliaments ; but the church once recognised as Brotestant, was to pass into her special charge, and the rough hand of an English house of commons was not to meddle with a matter of so fine a texture and so sacred. Elizabeth's love of state and splendour, naturally disposed her to retain all that could be safely retained from the imposing ceremonial in the church of the past. The pomp of an hierarchy, and the external symbolism which affects the imagination through the senses, were in harmony with her taste. That exception should be taken to an order of things in her own view so seemly and reason able she could never understand. The signs of such disaffection vexed her exceedingly. It marred the external symmetry to which she wished to see all things of this nature adjusted, and adjusted by the action of her own will. It was viewed as betraying a littleness and unsubmissiveness in her subjects, which detracted from her own greatness, and from her own * Strype, Ann. iv. 246-251. Whitgift, ii. I/5~IQ3- R R 2"], [634, "612 ANGLICANS AND PURITANS. BOOK X. Chap. z. Contest on the basis of divine right, right. It is the besetting sin of sovereigns, to account themselves great in the measure in which their sub jects are quiet, orderly, ready to do as they are bid. They do not often see, that the manhood of states must come from the manhood of subjects. But if Elizabeth flattered herself that she spoke and acted by a divine right, and under a divine guidance, the opponents of her religious policy all took the same ground. According to the conscience of the Bomanist, it was the command of God, that the pontiff, and not the queen, should be head of the church. According to the conscience of the puritan, and of the separatist, it was the command of God, that his faith and practice should be determined by the light of his own judgment, and not by injunctions coining to him from a worldly potentate. So far, in the case of Bomanist and Bro testant, there was a principle of divided allegiance. With both there were things to be given to C\u00e6sar, and things to be given only to God. Eliza beth might affirm, in the most emphatic terms, that to resist her will, was not only sedition, but im piety. But her opponents were not less skilled than herself in pressing argument in that form. They never ceased to reiterate, that to oppose their doctrine was to oppose, not man, but God. This virtual assumption of infallibility, and this inveterate dog matism as the consequence, belonged more or less to all parties. The queen was sure that she had a com mission to command ; and there were those among her people who were not less sure that they had a com mission to resist. These people did not scruple to assert, that the right to interpret the divine will, and to act upon such interpretation, pertained to the sub ject as much as to the sovereign. There were moments in which the queen would gladly have coerced these parties so as to have made them utterly power less. But to have crushed her Catholic subjects on the one hand, and her puritan subjects on the other, would have been to go far towards leaving herself without subjects of any sort."], [635, "613 HISTORY OF PURITANISM. It is hardly surprising, therefore, that the feeling book x. of Elizabeth against the puritans should have been Chap *' strong. It may have seemed presumptuous to resist her will even in favour of an ancient and infallible church. It must have been felt as presumptuous in a much greater measure, to resist it on the plea of per sonal conviction \u2014 of private judgment. Nor is it to be denied that this free temper in Puritanism regard to religion, was inseparable from a tone of senate. feeling of the same nature in regard to all the rela- te o# tions between sovereign and subject. The puritan was strong in his assertion of attachment to the per son and government of the queen, but it is manifest that he endeavoured to connect a large measure of liberty with his loyalty. Bomanists were excluded from parliament, and were left to give vent to their sense of hard treatment through other channels. But the deep puritan feeling of the country was always reflected in the house of commons, and the men there who made it evident, that they had not lost the me mory of those constitutional liberties, which had de scended to Englishmen from the time of the Blan tagenets, were eminently men of that character. Eli zabeth often scolded these persons on account of the freedom of their proceedings, and sometimes placed a daring speaker under restraint, or sent him to the Tower. But as the reader has seen, she gained nothing by so doing. In the end, she was always obliged to submit, more or less, and sometimes felt concerned to heal the breach she had made, by a more gracious bearing, and by kind words. With all their narrow ness and fault, the great conservators of the princi ples of liberty under Elizabeth, were our English puritans.

But yet, since the question ' at this time is of a toleration, not by connivance which ' may encourage disobedience, but by law which may give ' a liberty, it is good again to be advised, whether it fall ' not within the equity of the former rule ; and the ' rather because the silencing of ministers by this occa ' sion is, in this scarcity of good preachers, a punish ' ment that lighteth upon the people, as well as upon ' the party : and as for the subscription, it seemeth to ' me in the nature of a confession, and therefore more ' proper to bind in the unity of the faith, and to be ' urged rather for articles of doctrine, than for rites and ' ceremonies, and points of outward government. For ' however politic considerations, and reasons of state, ' may require uniformity, yet Christian and divine ' grounds look chiefly to unity.' Had these large views been possible to the mind of Elizabeth, and to such churchmen as Whitgift, how different would have been the complexion of English history through the century which dates from 1560! The following sentences are as the words of a king, before which there is no rising up. ' To my lords the tFhaeu^s\u00b0fo ' bishops I say, that it is hard for them to avoid blame \u2014necessity ' in the opinion of an indifferent person, in standing \u00b0fj\u2122*orm.

' no offers of the bishops of bills in parliament, which, ' no doubt, proceeding from them to whom it properly ' belongeth, would have everywhere received accep ' tance.

' But if it be said to me that there is a difference ' between civil causes and ecclesiastical, they may as ' well tell me that churches and chapels need no ' reparations, though castles and houses do.' But these words produced no impression on the men to whom they were addressed. They persisted in the ' turbulent' purpose of retaining everything \u2014 of retaining everything in a more imperative tone than ever, and in exacting, not only that there should be the strictest conformity, but that every man should declare by subscription that everything included in that conformity was according to the word of God. And what was the effect? The majority of the people over a large part of England, and especially in the cities and towns, were with the preachers, as the puritans were called, and not with the bishops. On the whole, it is easy to foresee, that if the course thus far taken by church and state is to be the course of the future, there will be a limit to endurance.* * ' In the earlier years of Elizabeth,' says Mr. Hallam, * the advocates of a simpler ritual numbered the most learned and distinguished portion of the hierarchy.' \u2014 Const. Hist. i. 193. How the case stood in regard to the country at large, at a later period, is thus stated by Parsons the Jesuit : ' The puritan is more generally favoured through the realm with all those who are not of the Roman religion than the Protestant [men of the Parker and Whitgift type], upon a certain general persuasion that his profession is the more perfect, especially in great towns.' \u2014 Doleman, Conference, 242."], [639, "BOOK XI.

She had come almost as an angel of Great 1 v t \u2022 mi -i & powerceded deliverance to the nation. The material condition of to Elizabeth the state as left by Mary, could hardly have been worse ; \u2014 an w y? and the detestation with which her religious rule was regarded by the wisest and the best could hardly have been stronger. Elizabeth possessed great advantage over her predecessor in her presence, and still more in her genial manners, and in her political prudence and self-control. Her people gazed upon her as on one evidently born to be a queen ; and she flattered them in being careful to make them understand that she was always proud of them. Everything, moreover, was dependent on her life. She continued childless and husbandless, and, in the event of her decease, the next person in succession was the Scottish queen, who was a resolved Catholic, and allied intimately with that party over Europe. The position of Elizabeth in this respect resembled that of her father. In both cases, the greater part of the nation felt that every interest involved in their own life, seemed to be bound up with the life of the sovereign. Bomanists well understood this condition of affairs ; and all men saw, that the removal of Elizabeth, which"], [640, "618 ENGLAND UNDER ELIZABETH. BOOK XI. Chap. i. Elizabeth's first parlia ment. Second par liament. Benefit of the clergy \u2014 theft an art and mystery. would have been as a death-knell to the one party, would have been as life from the dead to the other. Hence the bold adventures that were made by Catholics in the paths of conspiracy, and hence the bitter denunciations of that party by Brotestant and puritan. Men who had embarked everything in the great revo lution of the age, never ceased to feel, that to quarrel seriously with Elizabeth would be self-destruction. She might have her faults, and it might be needful at times to place some curb upon them, but between the English queen and the great heart of England, there must be no strong or lasting difference. The great measures in the first parliament under Elizabeth, were those which recognised the queen's title ; which restored the ecclesiastical supremacy to the crown; and which required the use of the Book of Common Brayer in all churches. Two acts, however, were passed, which, after the manner of former statutes, attached the penalties of treason, not only to attempts to depose, or to harm the person of the sovereign, but to the wilful utterance, after any manner, of words denying the titles proper to her position, or impeaching the claims of herself, or of her offspring, to the throne. The spreading of false and slanderous news concerning her majesty, might also bring an offender within the compass of these statutes.* It was in the next parliament that the law was passed which converted the Act of Supremacy into a test-act, virtually excluding Catholics from the legis lature. From an act in Elizabeth's third parliament, we learn that the privilege called benefit of clergy, revived in the last reign, was still in use, and the account given of some of the persons who were wont to claim this privilege, presents a vista through which we can see a little of the under-play of social life in this age. The men thus claiming the privilege of * i Eliz. 5, 6."], [641, "619 GOVERNMENT AND INDUSTRY. 'clerks,' from their being ecclesiastics, or persons of book xi. some education, are described as cutpurses and felons. CaAF' .' They are said to exist as an organized brotherhood, following their vocation as an art and mystery. They live idly, by the secret spoil of the good and honest people of the realm. They are commonly found in fairs and markets, and wherever people gather in crowds, whether it be to hear the word of God, to watch proceedings in a court of justice, or to see an execution. They pilfer, with amazing skill and audacity, not merely in the sight of the judge and the gallows, but in the home, and in the very presence of royalty. Such is the preamble to an act which deter mines, that in time to come, felons of this character shall be prosecuted as felons, whether found to be scholarly or ignorant.* It is easy to imagine the haunts in the distance where such gentlemen were wont to hold their revels. The laws of this reign which most affect the liberty of the subject, are those designed to place Bomanists under adequate restraint ; and those which, through the Court of High Commision, gave so much licence to Barker and Whitgift in their proceedings against puritans and sectaries. Those laws belong to the history of government under Elizabeth,! but they have already passed under review. There are many other matters, however, which pertain to such a his tory, and of which no mention has been made. Elizabeth was economical in her expenditure, and Money chary of entering into costly wars. She never did so [^n 0rbbe without seeing beforehand that the intended hostili- nevoience. ties would be popular, and that her people would be found ready to bear the burden so imposed. It is not surprising, therefore, that attempts to raise money otherwise than by a vote of parliament, should have been very rare in this reign. The principle that it belongs to parliament, and to parliament alone, to levy * 8 Eliz. c. 4. f See Book IX. c. 2 ; Book X."], [642, "620 ENGLAND UNDER ELIZABETH. BOOK XI. Chap. i. Proclama tions. taxes, was never denied by the ministers of Elizabeth. In the early period of her reign, the queen sometimes borrowed money at Antwerp at twelve or fourteen per cent. When she began to borrow of her own subjects it was at a much lower interest, with a fixed promise of payment, and the payment was made. The loans obtained by privy seals were loans from the wealthy only, were always in anticipation of the ordinary revenue, and were not often any real loss to the lenders. Elizabeth said she had no wish to receive any contribution on such occasions which was not willingly made, nor have we any reason to suppose that she would have sanctioned any harassing pro ceedings against such as refused. It seems to be clear, however, that her officers were not quite so scrupulous, and that there were instances in which the fear of greater inconvenience may be supposed to have produced compliance. But it is to be remem bered, that nearly forty years from the accession of Elizabeth passed away, and in one instance only, during all that interval, had she solicited a loan from her subjects. Two or three instances of this nature occurred afterwards, but for all the cases there was a plausible reason. Of course, even within these limits, such precedents were dangerous. Brinces are com monly bad creditors. Nothing, however, could be more manifest, than the exceptional nature of these proceedings. The government always spoke of them as being of that character.* In the sixteenth century, when the speed of tra velling was not what it is now, parliaments did not meet every year. On the contrary, their votes of money * Strype's Annals, ii. 102 ; iii. 147, 538.

It was at such times that a sudden loan might become plausible ; and that proclamations, trenching somewhat on the province of law, might seem to be warranted by circumstances. Broclamations are, of course, always binding in the measure in which they are based on law. Nor does it seem safe to say that the sovereign in coun cil might not issue injunctions, in the times under con sideration, to meet a sudden exigency, which should, in themselves, have the force of law. In our time, with laws so ample and defined, this concession to the power of the crown can scarcely need to be made. But in the times preceding the age of Elizabeth, some authority of this kind seems to have been generally regarded as pertaining to it. The subjects of Eliza beth do not appear to have accounted her as offending very seriously in this direction. It should be added, too, that when she did thus offend, the offence was less in reality than in appearance. It was by authority in this form, however, that Elizabeth could venture to require that all Irishmen should return to Ireland ; that all anabaptists should leave the kingdom ; that no new buildings should be raised within three miles of London ; that there should be no exportation of corn ; and that certain usages in regard to apparel and bearing arms should be discontinued. Elizabeth well knew, that if her proclamations became such as to be judged undue and injurious, complaint would arise, aud the next parliament would hardly fail to make it manifest that such exercises of her prerogative were not expedient. There was danger, however, in this custom, inasmuch as concessions that could be safely made to Elizabeth, might become very mischie- vous precedents in the hands of a successor. The"], [644, "622 ENGLAND UNDER' ELIZABETH. BOOK XI. Chap. i. Unwar- ranted im- prison ments. only proclamations admissible in good governments are proclamations that give effect to law.* On no point has the guardianship of English law been made more vigilant, since the days of Magna Charta, than in its provisions to secure the subject against arbitrary imprisonment. But it is manifest, that under Elizabeth, this great immunity of English men was often violated, both by the Court of High Commission and by the council, sometimes by the members of the latter body on their personal autho rity. From a memorial, signed by eleven, judges, drawn up about the year 1590, it is clear that the great men in the council sometimes committed persons to prison without assigning any lawful cause, and without intending that they should be brought to trial, imprisonment being used as a punishment on private grounds. Some men were so committed, be cause persisting in suits at law against such magnates. Some, even serjeants-at-law, were thus punished for executing the queen's writs to secure trial or deliver ance to such prisoners. The prisoners being thus released, no charge being brought against them, were sometimes no sooner at large than they were again apprehended, and sent to some obscure place of con finement, where the benefit of a jail delivery would be more difficult to obtain. These abuses of power are described by the judges as ' against the laws of the ' realm,' and as subjecting her majesty's subjects 'to ' grievous charges and oppressions.' It is to be re gretted that we have not the names of the members * One of Elizabeth's proclamations prohibited the cultivation of woad, because the smell was offensive to her.

The reader has seen that a parliament under Henry VIII. raised the proclamations of that monarch to the place of laws. The act supposed, that without such warrant, proclamations could have no such authority. That sycophant enactment was rescinded under Edward, and the old constitutional distinction between proclamations and statutes was reiterated \u2014 a distinction which was real, though not easy to be defined in some circumstances. ."], [645, "623 GOVERNMENT AND INDUSTRY. of the council who could be capable of such practices, book xi. It is not more clear, however, that such things were CtIAP' '' done, than that the guardians of the law, the men who best knew what the English government should be, denounced them at the time as being contrary to its true maxims and spirit. The judges seem to concede, that in cases of treason, there may be rare instances in which the trial of a prisoner should be postponed. But they claim, that in such a case, the prisoner should at least be produced in court, and not be remanded without sufficient cause for his commitment being cer tified. Such was the interpretation given by Selden and Coke in 1627, to this memorable remonstrance of the Elizabethan judges, and the crown lawyers opposed to them made no exception to it. On the whole, the fault in this respect was a fault of administration. It was not a fault of law. What was done, was done, not merely without law, but against law.* The reader has seen that strong measures were Restraint. adopted in the time of Henry VIII. to prevent the circulation of obnoxious books. Those measures were somewhat softened under Edward, but returned with full rigour under Mary. According to the injunctions issued by Elizabeth, the year after her accession, no person was at liberty to print a book of any kind without licence from his ordinary or from the council. The reader has seen how the puritans evaded these regulations some years later. Several editions of the Admonition to Parliament were sur reptitiously printed within a short space of time ; and the authors of the Marprelate tracts, to ensure the printing and diffusion of their publications, were still more ingenious and determined in their contrivances. Many of the severest penalties inflicted on state de linquents during this reign, were inflicted as the punish ment of offences against these press laws. It was * Anderson's Reports, 297 et seq. Hallam, 518, 519. Brodie, i. 232-236."], [646, "624 ENGLAND UNDER ELIZABETH. BOOK XI, Chap. i. Martial law. thus with Barrow and Greenwood, with Stubbes and TJdal, and with Thacker, Copping, and Benry. What such men had said could not readily be proved, but what they had printed furnished a double ground of accusation \u2014 printing at all without licence being a crime, and the secret printing of matter construed as seditious became a double criminality. When it is said that Whitgift would not allow Cartwright to answer the authors of the Bhemist Testament, it is meant that licence to print on that subject would not be granted to him. The laws against the press be came the most stringent soon after Whitgift's pro motion to the see of Canterbury ; and from that time, unlicensed printing became more common, and the language published by such means became more intem perate than ever. Martial law supposes the existence of danger which ordinary law would not suffice to meet. The state must be saved ; and if ordinary means are not sufficient to that end, means more ultimate must be called into action. In 1588, thirty years after her accession, Elizabeth and her advisers supposed the danger of the English nation to be such as to justify a resort to such extreme means of safety. The document of that year which invested the lieutenants of the counties of Eng land with the powers of martial law was dated on the 1st of July. The Armada was then floating within sight of our coast, and what a few days might bring forth those days only could show. Distrust concern ing some of the English Catholics led to this precau tion, and the justice of such a measure at such a junc ture can hardly be questioned. But we have less knowledge of the reasons which may have justified a similar proceeding seven years later. The commission then issued, however, had respect to London and its suburbs only, and its weight was to fall on persons known to be of vagrant and lawless habits. Sir Thomas Wilford, created provost marshal, for the purpose of clearing the metropolis of"], [647, "GOVERNMENT AND INDUSTRY. 625 BOOK XI. Chap. i. these elements of disorder, was authorized to ' repair ' to all common highways near to the city, which any ' vagrant persons do haunt, and with the assistance of ' justices and constables, to apprehend all such vagrant ' and suspected persons, and to deliver them to the ' said justices, by them to be examined of the causes ' of their wandering, and finding them notoriously ' culpable in their unlawful manner of life, as incor ' rigible, and so certified by the said justices, to cause ' to be executed upon the gallows or gibbet, some of ' them that are so found most notorious, and incor ' rigible offenders.5* We have seen that the thief and vagrant class about London \u2014 men prosecuting their depredations as ' an art and mystery,' was very great some nine or ten years after the queen came to the throne ; and we here find that only a few years before her decease, this class, in place of being diminished, had become to an alarming extent greater. We have no evidence of any movement among them hostile in the political sense to the government. This strong, and very serious measure, had respect to them as a wrong to society, and the government determined to see if hanging some of the most notorious in this summary manner might not deter others from follow ing in their courses. To know that society was being plundered on all hands, and that justices and con stables were meeting men every day in the street who were known to be the plunderers, but could not touch them from want of formal proof against them, was a state of matters which queen and council seem to have decided should be endured no longer. We may be sure that none but known villains were hanged ; but the proceeding presents a very rough indication of Elizabethan rule, and the precedent was such as might lead to grave results another day. The constitution supposed the existence of a strong police, and in that case there would have been no necessity for such questionable measures. _____ * Rymer, xvi. 27g. II S S"], [648, "626 ENGLAND UNDER ELIZABETH. BOOK XI, Chap. i. The grand protest against mo nopolies. Evil or mo nopolies. Towards the close of the reign of Elizabeth, the granting of monopolies was the great financial abuse of her government. Batents ensuring to inventors a reasonable profit from their inventions, have never been a ground of complaint. In foreign adventure, moreover, where a large outlay would be required, with a very uncertain result, it was not strange that the adventurers should have been encouraged in their enterprise by some special means of protection. But Elizabeth often assumed the right to grant to com panies, or to individuals, ah exclusive privilege of dealing in certain articles, without any such reason to be assigned for so doing. In this manner, the queen might become possessed of large sums in the shape of gratuities or fines, and might place considerable emo lument in the hands of her favourites without con sulting any authority apart from her own. In so far as all those branches of trade were concerned, the queen virtually took the power of taxation into her own hands without consent of parliament. Her pre tence that money in her subjects' pockets was as money in her own, was one of her many insincerities. She would not tax her people heavily in a direct manner, but she taxed them with little scruple in this indirect way, flattering herself that this half-covert method of raising money by prerogative, and not by parliament, would hardly be seen in its true light. But it was not more natural that Elizabeth should prize such exercises of her prerogative very highly, than that her subjects should look upon them with jealousy and discontent. The right of monopoly once conferred, became a power to raise the price of the article monopolized, and so to levy a new tax, or, at least, to increase an old one. The effect was, that a double or treble price was soon exacted, and we read in some cases of the cost of the commodity being increased twelvefold.* Competition, on the other * ' Now they have gotten the only sale of things into their own hands,"], [649, "627 GOVERNMENT AND INDUSTRY. hand, might of course have ensured to the public a book xt. better article at a much lower price than the lowest CllAI' '' exacted by such persons. The history of monopoly under Elizabeth, was a history of the public interest sacrificed to private gain. When the parliament of 1597 met, this evil had P\u00bbli!iment grown to be so enormous, that the disposition to protest against it, and to demand redress, had become such as to fill the ministers of the queen with alarm. They contrived to postpone discussion on this matter to the last day of the session. But even then the popular members succeeded in imposing on the speaker an instruction ' touching monopolies, and patents of pri ' vileges, the which was a set and penned speech made ' by a committee' of the house. In her speech at the dissolution, her majesty said, that concerning those Elizabeth ' monopolies, she hoped that her dutiful and loving rogaove\" ' subjects would not take away her prerogative, which ' is the chief flower in her garden, and the principal ' and head pearl in her crown and diadem ; but that ' they will rather leave that to her disposition. And ' as her majesty hath proceeded to trial of them al ' ready, so she promises to continue, that all shall be ' examined, to abide the trial and the true touchstone ' of law.'* Had this promise been fulfilled, all might have been at rest before the meeting of another par liament. , \u25a0 Little was done, however, to abate these mischiefs, much to increase them. The next parliament was convened in 1601. About pfa^\u2122e'1' three weeks after its opening, the lower house, without \u00b0 any apparent cause, was found to be in great confu sion. Amidst noise which the speaker's voice was not sufficient to control, Mr. Lawrence Hyde rose and said \u2014 ' Mr. Speaker, to end this controversy, I move upon pretence of better furtherance of the commonwealth, whereas in time past we had sugar for fourpence the pound, it is now well worth half-a crown ; raisins and currants for a penny that now are sold at sixpence, and sometimes eightpence and tenpence the pound.'\u2014 Harrison, 3 74. * D'Ewes, 547.

' the house to have a very short bill read, intitled ' An ' Act for the Explanation of the Common Law in certain ' Cases of Letters Batents.' ' The house at once became vociferous in its approval of this motion. This pro posal, it will be seen, was to test all existing mono polies by the common law, and of course to declare all to be void for which the sanction of law could not be pleaded. In the last parliament, the house had con tented itself with a petition, which prayed her majesty to correct these evils. In proposing, as at present, to proceed by bill, the commons had advanced a step further. The prayer of the last house of commons left the abolition of these obnoxious customs to the discretion of the crown \u2014 the bill now introduced left no such option. The ministers and courtiers urged that the former and milder course should still be taken. The answer of their opponents was \u2014 We have tried that course, tried it in vain, why should we return to it ? ' Mr. Speaker,' said Mr. Francis Moore, ' I know the queen's prerogative is a thing curious to ' be dealt withal \u2014 yet all grievances are not compa ' rable.

BOOK XI. Chap. i. Elizabeth yields 10 the protestors. monopolies had been recently abolished. It is a pity, was the reply, that a promise of some four years' standing should seem to have been so long for gotten ; and still more to be regretted, that the old monopolies, which have been abrogated, should have been so greatly out-numbered by the new ones created. As the speaker proceeded to read a series of patents thus recently issued, placing many articles of common consumption under such restrictions, Mr. Hackwell, of Lincoln's Inn, stood up, and inquired \u2014 Is not bread among those articles ? \u2014 and the cry 'bread, bread,' came from many of the members. ' Yes,' continued Hack well, ' if order be not taken, bread will be there before ' the next parliament.'* Some members would have had all these monster grants read in the house, and each condemned as read. Elizabeth, in the days of her comparative youth, and in the fulness of her power, had been wise enough, in more than one instance, to see when it became her v<j piace some rescranrc on ner passion lor rule, as the price of preserving quiet and loyalty among her people. Such a time had now especially come. Cecil had to report to his mistress, not only the excitement in the house, but that as he passed the street in his coach, he heard voices shouting, ' God grant that pre ' rogative touch not liberty \u2014 God help the men who ' would destroy monopolies.' On the last Wednesday in November, less than a month after the opening of this parliament, and less than a week after the commencement of the debate on monopolies, the Speaker, after some ordinary business had been trans acted, rose from his chair, and remained for some while silent\u2014 the house looking upon him, in much stillness and wonder. Bresently, that learned person pro ceeded to say, that her majesty had entrusted him with a message to her faithful commons. He was to assure the house from the queen that oppression in any form * D'Ewes, 648."], [652, "630 ENGLAND UNDER ELIZABETH. BOOK XI. Chap. i. Bevenue of Elizabeth. Influence of the crown. among her people was always affliction to herself; that she had reason to believe that many of the patents which she had granted had been used to the great injury of her subjects; and that she had in conse quence determined that all these patents should be at once suspended, and ' none be put in execution, but ' such as should first have a trial according to the law, ' for the good of the people.' Great was the joy of the commons on the reception of this message. Some of the members would have connected with their vote of thanks to her majesty, a sort of apology for the free speaking in which they had indulged. But the wiser heads interposed to save the house from that folly.* It is not easy to speak with any definiteness or cer tainty concerning the revenue of Elizabeth. The sums voted for the public service by parliament afford us scarcely any guidance on this point. They certainly were not such as by any means to cover the expendi ture.

The usual vote concerning the duties at the ports passed on her acces sion \u2014 they were granted for her life, but were not to be varied without consent of parliament. She made all that could be prudently made by her wardships. She even laid herhand upon church property, and in great exigen cies she did not scruple to alienate lands belonging to the crown. Elizabeth was not avaricious. She saved nothing. But she economized everything, and she did so because her love of power immeasurably tran scended her love of anything beside. The sagacity and firmness of her policy in these respects were extra ordinary. The great measure of financial reform in the age of Elizabeth was the reform touching monopolies. The * D'Ewes, 651-654."], [653, "631 GOVERNMENT AND INDUSTRY. BOOK XI. Chap i. Privileges of parlia- I -ut. speeches delivered in that memorable debate seem to warrant the conclusion, that while the majority of the members were strongly opposed to these patents, there were others who possessed a direct or indirect interest in them. In all the debates under Elizabeth of which any full report has reached us, there are men whose speeches betray that their hopes are directed towards the court and the government, and that they are pre pared to pay the price of their expectations in flattery. But the reader has seen something of the resistance made to the policy of such men. The ministers of the crown throughout this reign, did what they could, as all ministers have done, to influence the elections to parliament. The wonder is not that a large proportion of the commons should be found subservient to the court, but rather that the element of independence should often have shown itself to be so strong. The sixty places which sent members to parliament for the first time, or after long disuse, in this reign, were places, to a large extent, which the government could manage. But the large boroughs, and the counties, were less at their disposal, and often sent independent men. The reader has seen that Elizabeth would have con trolled the debates of the commons, and have re stricted the liberty of speech promised to every new parliament, within very narrow limits.* But though she presumed more than once to place members who had offended in this respect under restraint, she was not allowed to be successful in that policy. Before the close of this reign, the commons had fully established their claim to be themselves the judge of what should, or should not, be accounted orderly in the proceed ings of their own house \u2014 placing the persons offend ing against their own laws under restraint, or sending them to the Tower, in their own name.

It is in this reign, too, that the commons acquire the acknowledged right to settle all differences affecting contested elections, and to originate all money bills. The reader has seen in the trials of the duke of Norfolk, and of the queen of Scots, that the course of proceeding against state prisoners under Elizabeth was such as had been common under her predecessors. The law concerning treason continued to be of great latitude. Words which could not be construed as treason, might be construed as sedition and felony. What Elizabeth could do to avenge herself on persons who presumed to place themselves in opposi tion to her will, is seen in the case of Stubbes and Benry. Scarcely any event in the long life of Eliza beth is so little to the credit of her' good sense and consistency, as her conduct towards the duke of Anjou, who became a suitor for her hand. Elizabeth was then forty-seven years of age. Her lover was some twenty years younger, small in figure, and if report speaks truly, by no means agreeable in countenance. He was, moreover, the favourite son of Catherine de Medici, the Jezebel of France, in the estimation of all zealous Brotestants. Stubbes was a puritan, and had given his daughter in marriage to Cartwright, the great puritan leader. But he was a barrister, a scholar, and the friend of Sir Bhilip Sidney. In an evil hour for himself, he published an anonymous pamphlet, laying open, with much intelligence, the evils, personal, political, and religious, which were likely to follow upon such a match.* Elizabeth well * The pamphlet was intitled ' Gaping Gulph, in which England will le swallowed up by the French Marriage.'

She resolved to give some signal expression to her resentment. Stubbes and his printer were apprehended ; were sentenced to lose their right hand ; and the sentence was carried into execution. Benry had printed matter, which, according to the bad law of that time, might no doubt be construed as seditious. But more than twelve months had passed since that printing had taken place, and the law, in consequence, could not touch it. He was condemned on the ground of jottings in manuscript found in his possession, but which had never been 'uttered' at all. He was not exposed to any legal penalty, either by what he had printed or what he had written. But Benry was condemned and hanged. Such were the deeds that could at times be done bv Elizabeth \u2014 illegal and barbarous deeds.* But the history of the English government under summary. Elizabeth is not comprehended in the history of our state trials. The subject has more than one aspect. It is quite open to an artful advocate to show, that servile language fell from the lips of members of par liament ; that men who uttered a different language were sent to the Tower ; that the sovereign asked loans from the subject ; that proclamations were issued on many aud important matters ; that there were arbitrary arrests ; that there was martial law ; and that there were injurious monopolies. It is open to such an advocate so to present those facts, as to convey the impression that in England, it was the course of things, that the speeches in parliament should * Penry, addressing Lord Burleigh, says, ' The case is most lamentable, that the private observations of any student being in a foreign land, and wishing well to his prince and country, should bring his life with blood to a violent end ; especially seeing they are most private, and so imperfect that they have no coherence at all in them, and in most places carry no true English.' \u2014 Strype's Whitgift.

BOOK XI, Chap i. be the speeches of sycophants ; that speakers not of that order should be punished ; that the exchequer of the country should be supplied by forced loans ; that the laws of the statute-book should be superseded by proclamations; that arrests should take place in a manner wholly arbitrary ; that martial law should be a proceeding of common occurrence ; and that mono polies, however mischievous they may have been, should be judged as in accordance with the spirit and bias of the constitution.* But such representations are dis ingenuous, untruthful, misleading. There were servile speeches made in parliament ; but these have come down to us coupled with speeches anything but servile. There were attempts made to restrain freedom of speech in the commons ; but there was much free speaking there which called forth no restraint, and restraint when ventured upon, was found to be in every instance impolitic, and was abandoned. There were loans, too, on the faith of privy seals ; but these were of very rare occurrence, never resorted to with out urgent cause, never reached to the nation at large, and were scarcely in any case a loss even to the wealthy. There were proclamations also ; but they came in the long intervals between the meetings of parliament, and were always open to correction on the next assembling of the legislature, if found to have been in any serious degree contrary to law. There were arbitrary arrests ; but there were guardians of the law to declare that all such arrests were illegal and oppressive. There was martial law ; but it did not come into action in more than three instances during nearly half a cen tury- \u2014 first in the north, when the northern earls were in arms ; next, over England, when the fear of the English Bomanists, and the sight of the Armada, justified the proceeding ; and in the last instance it was restricted to the suburbs of London, at a time when the wealth of the capital seemed to be at the disposal * Hume, Hist.

Chap' '' Yes ; and there were monopolies ; but there was also the grand debate on monopolies, and its result, demon strating both their impolicy and illegabty. Honesty gives the whole truth. We should not pass from the topic of government FM\u00b0y \u00b0f. under Elizabeth without glancing at the course of the govern-8 's English cabinet towards Ireland during this reign, Awards The foreign policy of England under the Tudors was Ird3Ild materially affected by the relations of this country to Scotland and to Ireland. Until Scotland became Brotestant, she was a tool directed by France against England ; and during the later years of Elizabeth, Ireland was used in much the same manner by Spain. France saw little prospect of success in a war against this country when a diversion in her favour north of the Tweed could no longer be relied upon. Spain, at the same time, could hope to detract from the power of the English queen in continental affairs, by stimu lating the JJesmonas, me uncuco, j.jxxj\u00b1\u00b1ca, who were nominally her subjects, into insurrection against her. The history of Ireland to the close of the Tudor period in our annals, is singularly painful and unin teresting. The picture is ever changing, but con sists almost entirely of a change in the forms of perfidy, violence, and suffering. To-day the natives may have the country almost wholly in their hands \u2014 to-morrow they may be utterly prostrated by war, famine, . and pestilence. Elizabeth was too parsi monious to conquer Ireland, and was too much dis posed to govern it as though it had been conquered. Hence the conduct of her subjects consists of alternate submissions and outbreaks, and her own administra tion consists of alternations between menace and concession. The country was always making large demands on the English exchequer ; but to allow it to pass into the hands of Spain or of France did not com-"], [658, "636 ENGLAND UNDER ELIZABETH: BOOK XI Chap. i. Agriculture \u2014 the soil. port with English interests. Nor does there seem to have been any great solicitude felt by some men about the queen, nor, as we may suspect, by the queen herself, to see the social condition of the island materially improved. There is reason to think, that its rudeness was accounted favourable to its submission. If it could only be secured against insurrection, be governed without expense, and be kept from falling into the hands of Spain, the great objects of the English policy, it seems, would be secured. There were, indeed, Eng lishmen who looked to Ireland with much wiser and more friendly feeling, and who made large sacrifices in the hope of advancing its interests ; but from the want of adequate support on the part of the English govern ment, their efforts were in the main frustrated. In Ireland, Brotestantism was imposed by law, without the slightest preparation in the way of conviction or instruction ; and if there was a parliament, it was a parliament that might be used to almost any pur pose by English influence. But if social industry rm\u00a3 power maue sman progress m Ireland, it was other- wise in England.* \u25a0 A writer who is an authority on the subject has said, that husbandry in England, in the latter half of the sixteenth century, was much such as we find in Scotland a hundred years since. f Every farm of a moderate size had its flax-ground. From the growth on that piece of land all the linen of the family was produced by the women of the household. In the rotation of crops there were few signs of improvement. Barley and oats followed wheat and rye, with an in- terval of fallow. Clover was introduced from the Netherlands ; and pasture-land continued to be of a much higher price than arable. But, on the whole, much greater labour than formerly was bestowed on * Leland's Hist, of Ireland, bk. iv. c. 1\u20145. f Eden, State of the Poor, i. 121."], [659, "637 GOVERNMENT AND INDUSTRY. the soil, so that its produce had come to be twice as book xi. great as it once was. The farmer had become more J^J' sensible to the value of manuring. The sweepings of London were collected as serviceable for that purpose. In Sussex, large quantities of limestone were burnt in aid of agriculture, and the men of Cornwall conveyed sand to great distances for the same object. Land brought under the best cultivation yielded twenty bushels of wheat to an acre, thirty-two of barley, and forty of oats and pulse.* The effect of this measure of improvement became Live stock. visible in the abundance and the quality of the animal stock possessed by the English farmer. Harrison, a contemporary writer, exults in his descriptions of the herds and flocks which the agriculturists of his time could exhibit. There are no kinds of tame cattle, he writes, to be seen in other parts, of which England has not a good store, and in general of surpassing ex cellence.

The knavery in horse-dealing, however, was at the summit of the rogue's trade even in that day. Harrison, who grows eloquent when describing the English ox, is still more charmed by a flock of English sheep. ' Our sheep are very excellent, since for ' sweetness of flesh they pass all other.

England, it was said, was ceasing, from these causes, to be famous as the home of strong men. The Spa niard was watching this decay, and hoping to profit by it. The Bomanist at home was making note of the discontent thus produced, and flattered himself that the hour might come in which this feeling might be turued with effect against the government and the rich men. The reader will see an old story in all this, one of the forms of collision between rich and poor which have been fretting their way along in our his tory. The duke of Somerset had regarded these ten dencies as evils that might be abated, and that ought to be abated. The man who now comes into the place of the duke as so thinking, is Francis Bacon. He carries two bills through the commons condemning those excessive enclosures, and requiring that what was arable land on the accession of Elizabeth shall be arable land again, and that what is now arable shall not be converted into pasture. Great is the storm raised against these bills in the upper house. Sir Ed ward Coke is induced to bring all his learning to the help of their lordships. But the bills, with some modification, are carried. It is easy to take excep tion to the policy of such enactments. Their power, too, may not have been great. But they pointed to real evils; they attempted a remedy; they were a protest against a remnant of the old feudalism, and a * Harrison, 343, 344."], [662, "640 ENGLAND UNDER ELIZABETH. BOOK XI.

Melons, cucumbers, radishes, carrots, parsnips, turnips, and different kinds of salad were then common, and to be seen on the tables of the richest and the poorest. Gardeners had become greatly skilled in improving the qualities of their pro ductions by constant experiment in the dressing of soils and in grafting. Trees, flowers, everything was seen to change at their bidding. They were said to play with nature. The age which first brought tobacco from the Indies, contributed new things every year from the soils of distant and newly-discovered countries. By the side of improved products for food or for the eye, was a large supply of medical herbs, which in their decoctions enabled nine-tenths of the sick in that day to dispense with the doctor. Every good housewife was at home in the use of such simples. The mother of the great lord Bacon rarely wrote to him, or to his brother Anthony, when they were young men in town, without coupling medical advice with her advice on other matters. And lady Bacon was a person who could talk Latin, could cor respond in Greek, and was, as her great son truly said of her, ' a saint of God.'f The staple of English manufactures under Elizabeth continued to be very much what they had been in the later years of her father, the article which took prece dence of every other in quantity and value was woollen * Part.

The cloth produced in Chaf' '' the northern counties was of a coarse description, mostly of domestic manufacture and for domestic use. Halifax, indeed, was a prosperous clothing town, so much so as to tender the services of two thousand men towards crushing the rebellion of the northern earls in 1569. In the eastern and southern counties, there were many towns which had grown in wealth and population by means of this manufacture. Great part of their cloths was disposed of in English markets, but certain qualities of them were sent abroad to an extent little suspected iu our time. In many towns great numbers of hands were employed in producing coarse kerseys, which were mostly for exportation. Norwich was famous for its worsted fabrics. In the early years of Elizabeth, Norwich satins and fustians were in great demand. The same restrictive system of legislation in favour of home industry continued to be acted upon ; the same pre cautions were taken to ensure that the cloths should be of a certain measurement and quality ; and the same jealousy between the great masters in the towns, and the humbler producers in the adjacent villages, betrays itself.* The metals chieflv wrought in England during this Metals\u2014 tin . -1 \u2022 ,-!;\u2022\u2022 ill e~i aud iron. period continue to be tin, iron, and lead. Copper was not produced in large quantities, and the working of it could hardly be made remunerative. Baleigh held for awhile a patent on the sale of tin, and when his monopoly was assailed, boasted that he had doubled the wages of the miners. The chief thing remarkable concerning this metal, was the skill and taste with which it was now used in pewter wares. Elegant dinner services were thus produced, and there was * Anderson's Hist.

Iron was still smelted with charcoal, and the consumption of wood for this purpose in some districts was so great, that laws were passed on that account to prevent the increase of iron works in certain counties. Iron was wrought in Shropshire and Lancashire, but the great iron works were in Kent, Surrey, and Sussex.* It was, however, in the enterprises of the English navigator that the reign of Elizabeth became especially brilliant and memorable. The voyages of Frobisher in search of the north-west passage, date from 1567. As the three small vessels under the command of that able captain dropped down the Thames, Elizabeth watched them out of sight from her palace at Green wich, bidding them God-speed by the waving of her hand. The strait leading to Hudson's Bay, and since known by his name, was then discovered by Frobisher. He made several voyages into those seas, and lived to do good service against the Spanish Armada, more than twenty years after Elizabeth's farewell to him from the window of Greenwich palace. f About ten years after Frobisher's first voyage to the north, Francis Drake steered his way southward to cir cumnavigate the globe. He passed the Straits which had been discovered by Magellan, half a centuiy since, and ran up the western coast of America as far as 480 north. Drake had fallen upon the Spanish settle ments and Spanish ships without reserve, though England was not then at war with Spain, and accumu lated large treasure. He crossed the Facific by the Moluccas and Java, and reached home by the Cape of Good Hope, after an absence of nearly three years.

'' enemy. Drake no doubt had the approval of Eliza beth in some form when he left, and it is certain that on his return she received him with great honour. The complaints of the Spanish ambassador were bitter, and some show was made towards securing compensa tion to Spanish merchants who could prove their losses. But the replies of Elizabeth to the demands that would have excluded English ships from the American seas were lofty and decisive. She knew not what right the bishops of Bome could have to parcel out God's earth among their favourites ; nor could she for a moment grant that to cruise in the great seas which washed the American continent was to be the privilege of Spaniards. The sea was the great open way of nations, and she hoped the English flag would be seen wherever the right and interest of England might be served by its presence. What the queen said was said everywhere by her people ; and loud was their admiration of the great captain whose heart seemed to be made up of all that was in their own heart.* In the later vears of Elizabeth, John Davis made a sir joim _ _ Travis further effort towards discovering the north-west pas sage. We need not say without success. But Davis Strait was added to the maps of those regions from that time.

Raleigh, assisted by his kinsman Sir Humphrey Gilbert, and by his friend Sir Richard Grenville, made a steady effort to colonize the pro vince since known as Virginia. But the men left to perpetuate possession were not strong enough to keep their own against the natives. Many perished, some returned home, and the end was a failure.* The smallness of the means by which such great undertakings were attempted, bespoke the amazing buoyancy of the national character. Frobisher's first armament consisted of two vessels of twenty-five tons each, and of a third that did not exceed ten tons. Drake, in resolving to pass the Straits of Magellan, re solved to do what no Englishman had done before him. For this object he collected a somewhat larger force. But his five vessels had been placed at his dis posal by private persons, and if the largest was of a hundred tons burden, the smallest was a pinnace of not more than fifteen tons. In the effort to colonize Vir ginia, three or four vessels of very moderate burden were deemed sufficient to warrant such a scheme.

But there was much of the fresh warm blood of youth in England in those days. While the pulsation in the heart of our countrymen beat thus strongly, making itself felt to the ends of the earth, intercourse with the more known countries of the world would become daily more frequent.

But in France, in Germany, in the Netherlands, in the northern states, and especially in England, there was a firm purpose to resist this attempted usurpation. We trace the signs of this determination, in the endeavours made to find a new passage to the more opulent regions of the earth, now by the north west, and now by the north-east. + One armament after another was despatched, full of hope, in those opposite directions. But the struggle issued in the founding of the memorable East India Company for England, and in the same bold policy on the part of Holland. During the greater portion of the reign of Eliza beth, Antwerp was the great commercial city of the west. The annual exportation of English cloth to the traders of that city, is said to have reached the value of a million sterling, and the other products of English industry there disposed of were of a still higher aggregate worth. Four-fifths, indeed, of the European imports seen in that mart are described as from England. These are surprising statements, but the authorities on which they rest are such as should be unbiassed and well informed.]: In 1565 some fixed * Hist.

In 1582, the extinction of the great German monopoly which had been granted anew to the Stillyard company, occa sioned deep offence in the towns of the Hanseatic con federacy, and the German diet was led to prohibit the importation of English cloth into those parts. But the English Merchant Adventurers counteracted this jiolicy by exporting their goods, first to Staden, and afterwards to Hamburgh.

These of old time linked them selves together, for the exercise of merchandize, trading in cloth, kerseys, and all other, as well English as foreign commodities, vendible abroad, whereby they brought much wealth home to their respective places of residence. ' Their limits are the towns and ports lying between the river of Somme in France, and along all .the coasts of the Netherlands and Germany, within the German sea. Not into all at once, at each man's pleasure, but into one or two towns at most within the said bounds, which they commonly call the mart town or towns, because there only they stapled their com modities and put them to sale, and thence only they brought such foreign wares as England wanted, and which were brought from far by merchants of divers nations, flocking thither to buy and sell as at a fair. The Mer chant Adventurers do annually export at least 60,000 white cloths, worth at least 600,000?., and of coloured cloths of all sorts, kerseys, bays, cottons, northern dozens, and other coarse cloths 40,000, worth 400,000/. ; in all one million sterling, besides what goes to the Netherlands from England in other commodities.' Then follow the names of such commo dities, filling a large space.\u2014 Cited in Anderson, i. 453.

THE age of Elizabeth forms a memorable epoch in the intellectual and social development of Eng land. The signs of progress are everywhere, and so bright and cheery is the general aspect of affairs, com pared with the gloom and terror which has preceded, that many of our writers, charmed with the transition, have seemed to become in a great degree insensible to the imperfections and errors from which this brilliant period was by no means exempt. The changes under Edward, and the brevity of his reign, were not compatible with any considerable pro gress in learning. Mary and her advisers, if power had been given them, would have restored Duns Scotus and the schoolmen to their old ascendancy in the universities. But the measure of encouragement that had been given to good learning under Henry and his successor had not been without fruit. Not a few who had been thus influenced survived to the time of Elizabeth, as a leaven for the future, many of them becoming distinguished as public men and as public teachers. Most of the exiled Protestants under Mary prosecuted their studies in the foreign universities. On their return they were for a considerable time the most learned men in England, and their example operated widely in favour of that range of culture to which they were attached. Classical studies, including the study of Greek, were gradually revived in Oxford and Cambridge. Elizabeth was addressed in a Greek oration, and replied in the same language. But too"], [671, "649 INTELLECTUAL AND SOCIAL LIFE. much must not be inferred from this fact. During bookxi. many years, the signs of a taste for general literature CtlAP' z' were few, and improvement in that respect was very slow. Indeed, it is not until we reach the latter half, and more especially the last ten years, in the reign of this illustrious princess, that our attention is arrested by those works of genius and of reflective intelligence, which have contributed to make the time of her sovereignty so attractive to the student of our literary history. The great Elizabethan writers, as they are called, were all the growth of the age of Elizabeth, but the riper fruit yielded by most of them did not ap pear until the sceptre had passed from the last of the Tudors to the first of the Stuarts. To the middle 'of the sixteenth century the great change in controversy between Brotestants and Bomanists had onifeTr\" been mainly theological. The points especially at troversy00\" issue were justification, the efficacy of the sacraments, and the manner of the Divine presence in the eucha rist. But the reader has seen, that about the time mentioned, great care was taken that the men raised to the papal chair should be men of high ecclesiastical reputation. And it is observable, that with this higher personal claim on the part of the pontiffs, came a disposition to attribute to them a higher personal authority. The infallibility of his Holiness, and his right to depose kings, and to absolve subjects from their allegiance, were doctrines which had been allowed to drop into comparative abeyance for a cen tury past. But all these tenets now came into a new prominence, and materially changed the ground of debate between the two churches. The popes, in becoming more conspicuous as secular princes than as spiritual persons, had brought much dishonour and weakness upon their office. The aim now was to recover that lost ground. The Jesuits were intensely active in support of this policy, and their learned zeal imposed the necessity of similar effort on their op ponents."], [672, "650 ENGLAND UNDER ELIZABETH. book xi. Theology, history, speculation, and ethics were all Chaf- z- more or less involved in this controversy, and the divines1' Do\u00b0kish mind of England flowed almost exclusively through those channels during the first half of the reign of Elizabeth. Our English divines did not take such part in this new form of the old strife as to make their influence felt beyond our own island ; but they were many of them learned and able men, and the number of such men continued to increase. Among the names included in this class, special mention should be made of Jewell and Hooker, of Berkins and Broughton, and of Cartwright and Bey nolds. The works of such men show what the food was from which the mind of England in the time of Elizabeth derived a large portion of its life. It was, however, the more religious and grave persons among our ancestors who drew their mental nutriment from such sources. Beyond these persons, there was a more refined class, who required something different ; and a comparatively rude multitude, who coveted something different still. Boetry and the drama addressed themselves to these classes, and, after awhile, with memorable effect. roetr7. The poetry of the age of Elizabeth commences with the Mirror for Magistrates, which owed its origin to the genius of Thomas Sackville, afterwards lord Buck- The Mirror hurst, and earl of Dorset. The work was designed to ftraus\"BU' be a kind of English Blutarch in verse. It was to set forth the lives of great men in English history from the conquest to the close of the fifteenth century. Sackville began to write before the decease of Mary. He had then studied at Oxford and Cambridge, and was probably a law student at one of the inns of court.* But he soon availed himself of assistance, and it is only the part of this work which came from his * Sackville was the son of Sir Richard Sackville of Witham, in Surrey.

Sackville wrote a preliminary poem under the title of an ' Induction,' and the part which relates to the duke of Buckingham, who perished by the order of Bichard III. The remainder was by other hands. In this ' Induction,' thepoet allows his imagination to enter the region of allegory, and what he has written is characterized by excellence of a higher order than is found in our history since the time of Chaucer, and such as was to exert a consider able influence on the genius of Spenser. It contains passages which Spenser has imitated and not sur passed. The Mirror for Magistrates was popular. It passed through several editions, and received various supplements. There was a want in the mind of the educated to which the poetry of Sackville ministered acceptably, sombre as it was, almost from beginning to end. The dark mysteries suggested by the fires of Smithfield seem to have haunted the mind of the young poet. Sackville is justly described as the link which connects the age of the Canterbury Tales with that of the Fairy Queen* Twenty years were to pass before Spenser was to Spenser. publish his first poem \u2014 The Shepherd's Kalendar. In that interval there was much versifying, but no poetry. Gascoyne only, rises somewhat above the dead level. But the Kalendar, which appeared in 1579, marked an epoch. It consisted of a series of pastorals adapted to the different months of the year ; and of pastorals in which shepherds were made to talk, for the most part, like shepherds, and not like courtiers. In 1590, the first three books of the Fairy Queen were published. The poet's Epithalamium \u2014 an ode in which the joy of his young married life is poured forth with the richest exuberance and power, was printed in 1594 ; and three more books of his great poem appeared two years later. * Bell's English Poets, 267-284.

In what he has written, we see the poetry which an Englishman could write in the time of the virgin queen, and which the subjects of that queen could appreciate, admire \u2014 admire with a passionate enthusiasm. Love and knighthood are the great subject of Spenser's muse, wrapped in allegory, so as partly to conceal, and partly to reveal, the characters and movements of the time. But the elements in these representations, on which he dwells with an affection such as no poet equally gifted had ever brought to those qualities, are purity and goodness. Let the reader begin with the first book of the Fairy Queen, and it will be strange if he does not find himself brought under a spell from which he would not willingly be released. The poem seized alike on all classes, and who can estimate the educating power of descriptions so full of nobleness and sanctity ? Sir Bhilip Sidney's Asfrophel and Stella \u2014 poems concerning his passion for lady Bich, another man's wife \u2014 place him far below Spenser in purity of feeling ; and with beautiful passages, his verse is often wanting in nature and simplicity. Though Sackville and Spen ser are the only poets Sidney seems disposed to praise, the last twenty years in the reign of Elizabeth pro duced many lesser compositions which were of consi derable merit. The dramatic writers published many pieces of this order.* The teaching of the theatre in our history has three stages. First came the old monastic Miracle plays, consisting of representations from scripture ; next came the Moral plays, which conveyed instruction through allegorical personages ; and, finally, the regu lar drama. The Moral plays made their appearance early in the sixteenth century, and did not wholly cease to be acted before its close. But the age of Eliza- * See the Poems of Greene and Marlowe; and the Songs of the Dramatists, in Bell's English Poets."], [675, "INTELLECTUAL AND SOCIAL LIFE. 653 beth is not more remarkable in any view, than in the book xi, growth of our dramatic literature during that period. c\" VF '' Its regular drama, like its poetry, began with Sackville, was followed by an interval of barrenness or medio crity, and closed amidst extraordinary splendour.* Sackville's tragedv of Gorboduc was acted before Dramatic writers* Elizabeth in 1562. It is founded on the fabulous times of British history. But much pertaining to the stoiy is merely related, and the speeches are long and heavy. It is such a piece as Sackville only could have written ; but subsequent writers adapted themselves to the public taste by introducing more stage action, and by mixing the gay with the grave. During the next twenty years, theatrical pieces of all descriptions were produced. The names of fifty have reached us, but only their names, f They were pieces to be acted, not to be read. So late as 1583, Sir Bhilip Sidney speaks in very disparaging terms of all the extant literature of that kind. Shakspeare's first play cannot be dated earlier than Early dr* 1 -i-i-i \u25a0 i_ raatists \u2014 the year 1590, and during the seven or ten years pre- shak ceding, his walk had been occupied by a number of apeare' men who had brought a new power into such author ship. Still, what such men as Marlowe, and Beele, and Greene were, in comparison with Shakspeare, may be safely inferred from the different fate which has awaited them in the history of the English stage. Many of them had taken up the subjects before, which the great bard took up afterwards, and we know with what effect. Of the thirty- seven plays written by Shakspeare, twenty-seven appeared before the decease of Elizabeth. In those days comedians existed, not only in com- Havers. panies, and, as at present, under the name of her majesty's servants, but as servants also to distinguished noblemen. The earls of Leicester, Warwick, and Derby, the lord chamberlain, and the lord admiral, had their respective companies of players.

Nearly twenty years in the reign of Elizabeth passed before any regular theatre came into existence. But in 1576 we find three play houses in the suburbs of London \u2014 the Blackfriars, the ' Theatre' in Shoreditch, and the Curtain Theatre, also in that neighbourhood. Soon afterwards we read of theatres under the name of the Baris Garden, the Bed Bull, the Fortune, the St. John Street, and, above all, the Globe. Great was the love of such amusements among the people, and the patronage bestowed on players by great men shows this taste to have been common to the high and the low. No doubt, the mind of the people was much influenced, and in many respects for the better, by such representations. The plays were many of them historical, going back to the past in our own annals, or to classical times. Many, who knew little or nothing of history from other sources, gained some knowledge of it from this source. The scene, when modern, was often laid in foreign lands, and set forth, though often very inadequately, novelties in life and manners. In comedy, the character, the frolic, and the buffoonery of society as it then existed, were faithfully given ; and in tragedy, the force of tempta tion, the progress of crime, and the Nemesis which follows on the track of guilt, were presented in strong light and shadow.* In a time when books were few, when reading was limited, and when travel was rare, there was much in such spectacles to suggest thought, to awaken feeling, and, in fact, to educate. We read of some London apprentices becoming so stage-struck as to hire a theatre for their own amateur per- * The Ancient British Brama, vol. i."], [677, "655 INTELLECTUAL AND SOCIAL LIFE. BOOK XI Chap. z. sormances, the auditory consisting of their personal Triends, present by special invitation.* But there is another side to this picture. There was at times a want of delicacy \u2014 a gross and immoral tone, in the acted drama, which could not be favourable to purity in the auditory. In the earlier years of Eliza beth, the stage, and the machinery which served the purpose of the actors, were commonly set up in the court or yard of an inn ; and, beside the inducement thus given to intemperance, vice between the sexes was encouraged by placing secret apartments at their services It should be remembered, too, that these exhibitions took place especially on holidays, which, as some maintained, were designed to be religious days ; and often on a Sunday, which should always be other wise occupied. In short, the demoralizing adjuncts of the stage, were as inseparable from it in that age as in later time, and public opinion concerning its influence was divided then very much as it has since been. The corporation of London, who knew its effects, pro nounced more than once against it, and banished it to places without the walls of the city. The men who entertained such views are commonly described as puritans, and the puritans were no doubt prominent among the opponents of playgoing; but many who were not themselves very puritanical, shared in the puritan feeling on this point. Let it suffice to re member, that the good and the bad in the tendencies of the theatre, had its influence in giving character to England under Elizabeth, j * Collier's Annals of the Stage, i. f Ibid- 214-218. J Nash, Greene, and Marlowe, and others, who were the chief writers for the stage just before the time of Shakspeare, were men of the most dis solute habits, and all shortened their days by their vices. It was in their nature to be gross, and if there was anything of good tendency in their writings, it was there, not so much from choice, as in the way of business. Public opinion and feeling were to be in some degree conciliated by such means. But to do anything really to elevate social morality or public taste was no matter of solicitude with them. It is pleasant to see that Shakspeare seems to have had a place from the first quite apart from such men. See Bell's Lives of Greene and Marlowe, English Poets."], [678, "656 ENGLAND UNDER ELIZABETH. BOOK XI. Chap. z. English prose. The euphu istic style. What the genius of Spenser and Shakspeare was to English poetry, the genius of Hooker and Bacon was to English prose. We have seen that our prose literature before the time of Elizabeth, if we except the writings of Sir Thomas More, made no pretension to elegance or eloquence. Men wrote simply as they spoke. The best form of, this style is in the works of Boger Ascham, who may be said to belong to the earlier years of Elizabeth. The first observable fact in the history of our prose under the last of the Tudors, is in the rise of that euphuistic style which became so much an object of admiration in the court. Lilly, the dramatic writer, in common with many of his colleagues, had been a university man ; and in two works, intitled Euphues, the Anatomy of Wit, and Euphues and his England, he set the example of a style which abounded in the use of words from the Latin, in mythological and recondite allusion, and in short epigrammatic sentences and conceits. The ability shown in such writing was often considerable ; but it is easy to imagine what the effect must have been, when richness of conception came to be a secondary matter, in comparison with such ingenuities of expression. It would have been strange if the learned studies in which so many ladies of the six teenth century excelled had not brought with them a considerable tincture of pedantry. In Elizabeth her self, something of this kind was natural ; and the way was thus prepared for the success which attended Lilly's experiment. The court was full of the praises of this new style. It was accounted so rich and brilliant. Every oue attempted something of the sort. Sidney and Shakspeare satirized it, but both were in some measure influenced by it. Something of it may be traced in Hamlet, more in the Arcadia. It was left to Hooker and Bacon to stand so much apart from it, and to rise so much above it, as not to seem to be aware of its existence. The bad custom of loading a page with quotations from"], [679, "INTELLECTUAL AND SOCIAL LIFE. 657 Latin and Greek writers was a form of this degene- book xi. racy.* C\"AP- *\u2022 The above remarks apply mainly to such prose as aspired to the rank of polite literature. In the con troversial writings, and in the loose pamphlets and tracts of the time, a different style prevailed. Men spoke through such channels according to their nature, and not unfrequently it was a very low nature which found expression in such forms. ' The common style,' says Mr. Hallam, ' of most pieces of circumstance, like ' those of Martin Marprelate and his answerers (for ' there is little to choose in this respect between parties), ' or of such efforts at wit and satire as came from ' Greene, Nash, and other worthies of our early stage, ' is low, and, with few exceptions, very stupid ribaldry. ' Many of these have a certain utility in the illustra ' tion of Shakspeare and of ancient manners, which ' is neither to be overlooked in our contempt for such ' trash, nor to be mistaken for intrinsic merits. 'f Writings which become popular, become signs of the popular taste, and the writings to which Mr. Hallam refers do not exhibit that taste in a very favourable light. There seems to me, however, more smartness, and command of language, in some of those com positions than Mr. Hallam has been inclined to re cognise. In regard to literature, the reign of Elizabeth was The g\u00b0v*r\"; long enough to embrace both seedtime and harvest.

Cecil, Bacon, Walsingham, Smith, Sadler, Knollys, were all men possessing the sagacity and firmness necessary to guide the vessel of the state through the dangerous seas which were then to be navigated. The earl of Lei cester was the patron alike of players and of puritans, giving splendour to the court of the queen to-day, and disgracing it by uncertain fidelity, and bad deeds, or at least by incurring suspicion of such deeds, to morrow. Sir Bhilip Sidney, during his too short career, brought the charm of a high-born chivalry into the presence of his royal mistress. Sir Christopher Hatton wore the robe of chancellor, but could adapt himself with the best to the gayest fashions of a court. He was one of those rare men who know how to com bine a discharge of the weightiest duties with atten tion to the lightest accomplishments. But Sir Walter Baleigh may be said to have represented both the good and bad qualities of court and country more than any other man. We see in him statesman and charlatan, buccaneer and poet, the finished courtier at the feet of the English queen, and the hardy adven turer in the strange seas and strange lands of the new world. The earl of Essex, kinsman to the queen, rivalled this great Englishman in his showy qualities. But he lacked stability, mental and moral, and was no match against the Cecil party, whom he regarded as his enemies, and who from necessity or choice certainly became such. The struggle between these factions dates from the year 1595, and it reveals some thing of the moral deterioration which became observ able in the court of Elizabeth some years before her death. This strife was based on no public principle. It came almost wholly from personal considerations. It was the sting coming from this source which mad dened Essex into his last treason, and he fell by the hands of the men whom he would fain have pro strated. Both parties had been disposed to favour the puritans ; both had become cool in that policy ; and"], [681, "INTELLECTUAL AND SOCIAL LIFE. 659 the influence of both, though it cannot be said to have book xr. demoralized the court to the extent which the enemies CBAF'\"' of Elizabeth have sometimes affirmed, certainly con tributed to bring about that change for the worse which was so manifest as the queen drew near her last days. The relation of the English gentleman to the The gentry, courtier and the nobleman in the latter half of the p\"iar pas sixteenth century was very much as it has always times' been. In general, his refinements were less, but his occupations and amusements were mostly of a very wholesome description. He prided himself in riding a good horse, and in knowing how to ride him. He could tilt well in a ring, and could use all sorts of weapons with dexterity. He could show his strength in leaping or running, in wrestling or swimming. He aimed to be skilful at tennis, and in field sports. Open-air exercises of all kinds found favour with him. In his home amusements, he was expected to dance with a grace, and to show some taste for music. These are things, says Boger Ascham, ' very necessary ' for a courtly gentleman to use.'* The master of the old Tudor manor house, with its old Tudor fur- niture, and its old Tudor costumes, was generally such a man. He vied with the nobles in the county in the patronage which he bestowed on all healthy rustic pastimes. Hurling and football, single-stick and archery, the country wake, the fantastic morrice dance, the farce exhibited on Blough Monday, and the revel over bringing in the yule log at Christmas, were all to his mind so many outlets of animal spirits, conducing to good neighbourhood, and to the health of the body politic. The puritans, for the most part, looked on such J^fjf saturnalia after another manner. In their estimation, nonnce the general effect of the village wake, was drunkenness in the men, and lewdness in the women, and a dispo- gUj sition towards idleness in both.

City life, and revel which lords and gentlemen were so forward to encourage, they could not regard as consistent with the thoughtfulness proper to religious feeling. Many of the great men who favoured such relaxations among the people, reminded the stricter men among the clergy, that there was a lord of ' Misrule' presiding even over such apparently unruly festivities; and assured them, that while patronizing such lightness of heart on a week-day, they should not be found less disposed to send their people to church to hear good sermons on Sunday. But, unhappily, these merry meetings were by no means restricted to the week day. Had they so been, they might have kept their ground much longer in our history. In many places the Lord's-day was constantly profaned by them. Hence, to the conscience of the puritan, they were not only questionable in their moral tendency, but posi tively irreligious. No doubt, the puritan view of human nature was, in many respects, narrow and unreason able. We cannot commend such severity of temper. But we can understand it. There was no braver blood in England than the blood of the puritans, and we can see how their lofty passions came to be fixed on objects quite apart from the circle of the Maypole, or the dance of the village-green. But both these parties, with their light and shadow, were alike a part of Eng land under Elizabeth, and together formed no small part of it. City life differed considerably from village life. What the open air of the country was in summer to the yeoman and the peasant, the warm and well lighted apartment of the city was in winter to the burgess and the artisan. In fair weather, the citizens had their out-door holidays ; but in foul weather, they had the best means of bidding defiance to the elements. The interior of St. Baul's was a promenade affording shelter in all seasons. The halls of the great com panies could be thrown open at any time without calculating the age of the moon, or looking to the"], [683, "661 INTELLECTUAL AND SOCIAL LIFE. signs of the weather. The stage, we have seen, was book xi. almost exclusively a town amusement. But we must CaAP z' now glance at the social condition of the people in some of its graver aspects. We have seen what the condition of the yeoman Artisans and the burgess was at this time. Journeymen sol- bourers. lowing trades, and the labouring class in agriculture, were the grades below those classes. The wages of the journeymen were such as to secure them a fair amount of comfort in food, clothing, and homestead, except in seasons of dearth, which towards the close of the reign of Elizabeth were not unfrequent. The con dition of the agricultural labourer was still in many instances a condition bordering on serfdom. Some writers in the time of Elizabeth make their boast that bondage had ceased to be known in England. But though the condition of formal slavery was very rare, Bondage it can hardly be said to have passed wholly away. In extinct0 7 1572, Elizabeth manumitted a slave born on one of her manors in Somersetshire. In 1574, she issued a com mission to lord Burleigh and Sir Walter Mildmay, ' for inquiring into the lands, tenements, and other ' goods of all her bondsmen and bondswomen in the ' counties of Cornwall, Devon, Somerset, and Glou ' cester, viz., such as were by blood [birth] in a slavish ' condition, by being born on any of her manors ; and ' to compound with all or any such' bondsmen or ' bondswomen in those four counties, for their manu ' mission or freedom, and for their free enjoyment of ' their said lands, tenements, or goods, as freemen.'* The men who could be described as ' bondsmen,' and as in a ' slavish' condition, while holding ' lands, * tenements, and goods,' must have been persons pos sessing their cottages, with larger or smaller patches of ground attached to them. But this is the last note in our history indicating the presence of a peasantry who could be spoken of in such terms. * Rymer's F\u0153dera, xv. 715, 73 1."], [684, "662 ENGLAND UNDER ELIZABETH. BOOK XI, Chap. z. Clothing and food of the pea- santry. Vagrancy and crime. In regard to clothing, the ordinary husbandman is said to wear garments of coarse cloth, made at home. The women wear gowns of the same material, with skirts of some lighter stuff. They cover their heads with a felt hat, and wear caps and aprons of linen. This linen also is of home manufacture. In regard to food, meat was not often before them, pmd their brown coarse bread was made from rye and barley, much more than from wheat. In fact, the peasant was still at the lowest point in the scale of the industrious classes, and his lot was often one of much privation. But it was in times of dearth, and often in times a little before harvest, that suffering was especially great both among husbandmen and artisans. So little fore cast was there in the corn-growers, that in ordinary years, the price of corn rose not unfrequently to five times its average value during many weeks before reaping time. The price of labour during harvest, and the price of grain about that time, must be pre cluded from any attempt to compare the average of wages with the average cost of food.* The reader has seen that our great cities in the time of Elizabeth were not without large classes who were disposed to live by any means rather than by honest labour. In 1596, an intelligent magistrate in Somer setshire addressed a letter to lord Burleigh, setting forth the vagabondage and felony prevalent in that county. f In that year forty offenders were executed in Somersetshire alone, and one hundred and eighty three were sent back to society, nearly one hundred and twenty being acquitted from the want of evidence, the remainder being either whipped or burnt in the hand. The magistrate has no doubt that those who were acquitted were as certainly guilty as those who were condemned. The calendar, it seems, consisted * Harrison's Bescription, bk. ii. 6, 7.

If Somersetshire book xi, be taken as an average county, forty executions in a CHAF ''' year give us 1600 executions for that space of time for England alone, and 72,000 executions for the whole reign of Elizabeth. This is exclusive of Wales, a country which will not be supposed to have been more orderly than England. It is appalling to think of such a multitude as sent to the gallows. But these, it seems, were not more than a fifth of the number who merited this fate, if felony deserved to be so punished. If this representation be anything like true, it shows that the lights of the brilliant reign of Elizabeth have their shadows \u2014 very dark shadows. These depredators, we are told, consisted in part of gypsies, but much more of soldiers returned from the wars, and generally of such inveterate idlers, that they would sometimes confess felony, and take the chance of being hanged, rather than be sent to the house of correction for a small theft, and compelled to labour.* They are known to exist as confederacies \u2014 sometimes roaming abroad fifty or sixty together. Not unfre quently, they intimidated the officers of justice, and even the magistrate on the bench.

But here we see, after all the wise legis lation of forty years under Elizabeth, and after the country has surely had time enough to work itself out of any mischief that may have come from the abbey-land affair, nearly the same picture of vagrancy and violence presents itself. f One cause of this dis- * Harrison, who makes this statement, supposes the gypsies in Eng land to be not less than ten thousand. f Harrison has two chapters on this subject in the second book of his"], [686, "664 ENGLAND UNDER ELIZABETH. BOOK XI. Chap. z. order may be found in the attempts which were still made to fix the price of labour \u2014 not indeed with all the oversight in respect to the fluctuation in the price of commodities with which some former legislators were chargeable, but certainly with only a partial sense of the difficulty arising from that quarter. When men were made to feel in this way that they could not hope to live by labour, they often deemed themselves at liberty to live by other means \u2014 espe cially as the law, which was so strict in dooming them to low wages in the country, was scarcely less strict in shutting them out from any better prospect in the towns. The apprentice system precluded the agricul turist from touching any sort of skilled labour beside. It was the feeling that much real want existed, and that want is naturally the parent of crime, which prompted to the series of attempts made during this reign to raise a voluntary supply for the poor \u2014 at tempts which ended in the passing of the first law for a compulsory poor rate. This law marks an epoch in our social history.* One material cause, however, of so much social disorganization lay in the want of a more efficient police, and that cause came from another \u2014 viz., from the dread of expenditure which characterized the government of Elizabeth. That she might not hazard her independence and popularity by looking too much to the help of parliament, and by the im position of heavy taxes, she left her subjects, in a great measure, to defend themselves as they best could, against swarms of vagrants, who grew into petty thieves, burglars, and cut-throats.

But the grand source of the necessity for such book xi. severe laws against vagrancy and crime, and of the cj^j_2 memorable poor-law under Elizabeth, is to be found in Jhf.gr!?t 1 n \u2022 fact m the one great element ot change involved m the transition transition of society from ancient to modern. There was no de\u2122 society poor-law \u2014 -no association for extending charity to the t0 modern necessitous, in the ancient world, inasmuch as the mass of the poor were bondsmen, and the property classes cared for their own bondsmen as they cared for their own horses or their own dogs. So likewise, when feudalism came in, the ' lordless' man \u2014 that is, the man for whom no man of property was respon sible, was an outlaw. Vassal and serf embraced all the humbler classes, and every vassal had his lord, and every serf had his owner. In modern society all these ties were to be severed. The wealthy ceased to have their vassals and serfs, and in consequence ceased to be under the same obligation to care for the classes who would once have held such relations to them. The men below them have all become free, and in being left to be self-governed, they have been left to be self-protected and self-supported. They may now claim the rights of free men, but they have taken upon them the obligations of free men. In the his tory of England, from the feudal times down through the whole Tudor period, we see how much easier it is to give freedom to the humbler classes, than to give those classes the enlightenment necessary to qualify them for making a safe and wise use of their freedom. This transition of the lower strata from a state of de pendence to independence, is, as we have intimated elsewhere, the great fact of modern society \u2014 the grand landmark of progress in the modern world : and even now, the training necessary to make this advance thoroughly wholesome to those who are the subjects of it, and to society at large, is only in process. Sup pression of monasteries, enclosure of lands, and the conversion of arable into pasture, are all only so many partial effects from this great cause.

Norfolk insurgency under Ket, the tanner ; and French insurgency under the guidance of philosophers, have come from one source. We see in them a new state of society deal ing with new problems. The state of society was inevitable, and the problems must be solved. But with this mass of evil resting on the lowest classes in English society, the signs of growing wealth and taste in the upper and middle classes, and of in creasing comfort in the homes of the industrious, were largely manifest. In the middle of this century, there were whole towns with not more than two or three chimneys to be found in them ; before its close, chim neys were common even in ordinary houses. In regard to lodging, the peasantry were obliged to content them selves with a pallet of straw, or a rough mat, with little covering, a round log of wood serving as bolster and pillow. ' As for servants, if they had an}r sheet above ' them, it was well, for seldom was there any under ' them, to keep them from the pricking straws, that ran ' oft through the canvas of the pallet.' But our an cestors in the time of Elizabeth saw great improvement in these respects.

And herein I do not speak of the ' nobility and gentry only, but likewise of the lowest ' sort in most places of our south country, that have .' anything at all to take to.

The great re volution in religion is so far accomplished and settled as to be safe from retrocession. Allied with this great change, we find a general awakening of mind, sending a new power through all the channels of enterprise, industrial and intellectual. The age of struggle under Henry, Edward, and Mary, is followed by the age of heroic achievement under their successor. The hot Celtic blood of Henry and Elizabeth prompts them to many arbitrary acts, but, on the whole, the scale has turned strongly on the side of freedom, and not on the side of prerogative. The sway of both has been much less arbitrary, and much more popular, in reality, than in appearance. The precedents of the past in favour of civil and religious liberty, form great landmarks that may not be removed. If the princes to come shall be disposed to respect those landmarks, they may reign safely, grandly, In the event of another policy, there must be other issues. The sixteenth century has seen England become a new world to live in ; and the prophecy in all things is, that the seven teenth century must bring with it greater changes still. * Harrison, 317.

Elizabeth's greatness needs no comment. But she was not perfect. Her courage was of a high order, but it was always influenced, and sometimes neutralized by her caution. Her economy was so rigid and systematic, as often to degenerate into parsimony. Her love of the English people was strong, but her love of power was stronger, and prompted her to inflict some grievous oppressions on no small portion of her subjects. She was desirous that Englishmen should be a manly race, capable of all manly deeds ; but in her conduct towards them, and even towards their representatives in par liament, she often seemed to account them as children, and not as men. She was zealous for religion, but could indulge in a violence of temper and language which seemed to betray a total want of it. Her sympathy with learning and culture was thorough and masculine ; but a sermon two or three times in a twelvemonth, and a reading of dull homilies the rest of the year, was all the provision she was concerned to make for the religious education of her people. She could be direct and brave, and she could be circuitous and insincere. But with all these real or seeming contradictions, her capacity was large and forecasting, and the debt of England, of Brotestantism, and of humanity, to her character and reign, is incalculable. Without her help, limited and hesitating as it often was, Scotland could not have asserted her independence of France ; and the Dutch could not have asserted their independence of Spain \u2014 which is in effect to say that Europe could not have been free.

The reception given by the public to my former volume has been such as to encourage me to proceed with my task. But the book has passed into some not very friendly hands. One critic sent a string of accusa tions against it to a weekly newspaper,* and, strange to say, subsequently passed off his second-hand wares on the editor of the Edinburgh Review as original \u2014 very much, it seems, to that gentleman's displeasure, when the imposition was discovered.f So long as this writer restricts himself to errors in single letters and single words, he detects some oversights which must be divided between my printer and myself, in what proportion to each I do not know. But when he passes from letters and words to facts, nearly every statement he has made is a misrepresentation or a blunder. For example, I am charged with supposing, that the controversy in European history about investitures, began with the discussion on that subject between Anselm and Henry I. In p. 387 I have spoken of this dispute between the primate and the king as coming up ' a few days' after Anselm's return from exile, and speaking still of that incipient stage of the quarrel, I go on to say \u2014 ' But the controversy which grew up in this ' way between Anselm and Henry, had become a European controversy. ' It had provoked the most angry discussions, especially in Germany, * where circumstances seemed to point to the Emperor as the most fitting ' person to sustain the rights of the civil power.' The reader will see that my statement is just the reverse of that which it has been the pleasure of the reviewer to attribute to me. In another place, pains are taken to insinuate that the preservation of Greek literature in the Lower. Empire to the close of the Middle Age, is a matter beyond the range of my know ledge. Here is a passage which I must suppose the reviewer to have read : \u2014 ' In the fifteenth century, the advance of the Turks towards Con ' stantinople, and the ultimate fall of that capital, made both the genius ' and the vast literary treasures of the East, the possession of the West. ' The cities of Italy became the special home of the Greek fugitives, and ' the depositories of those remains of ancient learning which they were ' careful to carry with them.' (p. 621.) The courtesy and veracity of such criticisms go well together. One of my sins is, that I have described Waltheof, the last of the Anglo-Saxon nobles, as beheaded seven year3 after the conquest, while I should have written ten years. But my critic knew that in the paragraph describing the death of Waltheof, I had also described him as engaged in a formidable conspiracy in 1074, the eighth year after the conquest, and as a state prisoner during the year following, and could not therefore have failed to see, that seven must have been a misprint for ten. Another of my sins is, that I have described the reli- gious foundation by Harold, at Waltham, as au abbey. Lappenberg, and his translator, Mr. Thorpe, are Anglo-Saxon scholars of the first rank. Here are words used by them :\u2014 ' the royal corpse was borne by the monks \u25a0\\ No. ccxxvii. * The Guardian, Oct. 19, 1859."], [692, "670 NOTE ' of Waltham to their a bbey, newly founded by Harold.'* Fuller, indeed, who has written a history of the abbey, describes its first inmates as consisting of 'secular black canons;' but this fraternity was so far monastic in its character, that in our literature, the foundation is always described as a monastery or abbey. Here are Fuller's words concerning it at the beginning : \u2014 ' Edward the Confessor bestowed Waltham, with ' the lands thereabout, on Harold, his brother-in-law, who presently built ' and endowed therein a monastery.'^ What should be said of a critic who can nibble after this manner? One blunder of my censor is amusing. I have said something about the remnant of Anglo-Saxons who, after the battle of Hastings, entered the service of the emperor Alexis, and my account is held up as teeming with signs of ignorance. But it so happens that the account is not mine \u2014 it is taken from Augustine Thierry, a writer whose knowledge of continental history was not equalled by that of any living man, and who read himself blind in the study of documents relating to that subject.^ So I might go on, and might close by using terms proper to designate criticism of this nature \u2014 but I forbear. My readers will understand me when I say, that I feel it to be humi liating to be obliged to touch such material, though to touch it is to expose its worthlessness. Had it been left in the journal where it first made its appearance, it would never have been noticed by me. But the case is somewhat changed when the Edinburgh Review can be used to such purposes. My candid and truthloving friend will hardly be allowed to grace me with any further attention in that quarter : but I shall pro bably be indebted to his kind offices elsewhere. It must suffice for me to say, that I feel indebted to several of my critics for valuable suggestions, but that in reviewing my first volume, the corrections I have felt it neces sary to make, do not affect the six hundred pages of which it consists to the extent of more than some half-a-dozen lines. * Lappenberg's Anglo-Saxons, ii. 303. t Church Hist. iii. 521.

The THIRD VOLUME, Octavo, 12s., of the History of England during the Reign of George the Third, By William Massey, M.P. Preface to the Third Volume. ' In preparing this Volume, I have been much aided by information derived from private sources. The late Mr. Edward Hawke Locker, a Commissioner of Greenwich Hospital, about forty years since, with the sanction of the Royal Family, and with the assistance of many distinguished persons, collected voluminous materials for a life of George the Third. The progress of the work, however, was stopped by the interposition of Lord Liverpool, then at the head of the Government, who thought the time had not yet arrived for such a publication. Mr. Frederick Locker has kindly placed at my disposal the papers collected by bis father for the important work which he had undertaken ; and I have thus been enabled to obtain much curious and interesting information, relating both to the public transactions and the secret history of this reign. Lord Bolton has likewise permitted me to refer to the extensive correspondence of his grandfather, the first peer, who was for many years in office, and in confidential intercourse with Mr. Pitt, especially during the earlier years of his administration. I have also had access to other private collections.' Volumes I. and II., 24s.
