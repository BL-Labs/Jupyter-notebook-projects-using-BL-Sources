IT may be safely asserted that no form of local administration or government attains to so high a position in popular esteem, or commands such a large measure of visible respect, as does a corporate existence under the municipal laws now in force in England and Wales. It is the system above all others which works freely and without friction between the State and the individual. On the one hand, it interposes firm barriers to a centralising interference in matters cf detail which could never evoke genuine confidence ; and, on the other hand, it promotes a fervent interest and healthy emulation in essential obligations closely allied with the family circle. Most true it is that \" our Municipalities produce qualities which are the best safeguards of England's greatness,\" * and it might be added, none the less justly, that their appreciated intervention between the national directorate and domestic duties plays no secondary part in stimulating that proverbial love of regulated independence which characterises the faithful type of an English citizen. The paramount purpose of the present compilation is to describe in the language of statistics the practical advance which the municipal institutions of England and \"Wales have made from the date of their re-establishment upon an intelligible and approved basis in 1835, and to afford easily comprehended means of comparison between two phases of municipal life separated by an interval of nearly fifty years. * Eight Hon. W. E. Gladstone. B"], [20, "2 ENGLISH MUNICIPAL INSTITUTIONS ; PART I. The Nature and Constitution of Municipal Corporations. A corporation is a franchise possessed by one or more individuals who subsist as a body politic under a special denomination, and are vested by the policy of the law with the capacity of perpetual succession, and of acting in several respects, however numerous the association may be, as a single individual. The object of the institution is to enable the members to act by one united will, and to continue their joint powers and property in the same body, undisturbed by the change of members, and without the necessity of perpetual conveyances, as the rights of members pass from one individual to another. All the individuals composing a corporation, and their successors, are considered in law but as one person, capable under an artificial form of taking and con veying property, contracting debts and duties, and of enjoying a variety of civil and political rights. One of the peculiar properties of a corporation is the power of perpetual succession, for in the judgment of law it is capable of indefinite duration The rights and privileges of the corporation do not determine or vary upon the death or change of any of the individual members ; they continue as long as the corporation endures. It was chiefly for the purpose of clothing bodies of men in succession with the qualities and capacities of one single artificial and fictitious being that corporations were originally invented, and for the same convenient purpose they have been brought largely into use. Corporations, private as well as public, or municipal, were well known to the Roman law, and they existed from the earliest periods of the Roman republic. The powers, capacities, and incapacities of corporations under the English law, do, indeed, very much resemble those under the civil law ; and it is evident that the principles of law applicable to corporations under the former were borrowed chiefly from the Roman law, and from the policy of the municipal corporations established in Britain and the other Roman colonies, after the countries had been conquered by the Roman arms. The first division of corporations is into aggregate or sole. Corporations aggregate consist of many persons united together into one society, and are kept up by a perpetual succession of"], [21, "3 their growth akd development members, so as to continue for ever. Corporations sole consist of one person only and his successors, and are incorporated by law in order to give them some legal capacities and advantages, particularly that of perpetuity, which in their natural person they could not have had. Another division of corporations, either sole or aggregate, is into ecclesiastical and lay; while lay corporations are again subdivided into civil and eleemosynary. The civil are such as are created for a variety of temporal purposes, and under this head are included municipal corporations. The eleemosynary sort are such as are constituted for the perpetual distribution of the free alms or bounty of the founder of them to such persons as he has directed. Corporations by the civil law seem to have been created by the mere act and voluntary association of their members. But, in England the consent of the crown is absolutely necessary to the creation of any corporation ; that consent, however, may be either expressly or impliedly given. The sovereign's implied consent is to be found in corporations which exist by force of the common law, to which former kings are supposed to have given their concurrence ; common law being nothing else but custom arising from the uni- versal agreement of the whole community. Another method of implication, whereby the consent of the crown is presumed, is as to all corporations by prescription, such as the city of London, and many others which have existed as corporations, time whereof the memory of man runneth not to the contrary, and therefore are looked upon in law to be well created. For, although the members thereof can show no legal charter of incorporation, yet in cases of such high antiquity the law presumes that there once was one, and that, by the variety of accidents which a length of time may produce, the charter is lost or destroyed. The methods by which the consent of the crown is expressly given are either by Act of Parliament or charter. When a corporation is created, a name must be given to it, and by which name alone it must sue and be sued, arid do all legal acts. After a corporation is so formed and named, it acquires many powers, rights, capacities, and incapacities. As \u2014 (1) To have perpetual succession. (2) To sue or to be sued, implead or be impleaded, grant or receive by its corporate name, and do all other acts as natural persons may. (3) To purchase lands, and hold them for the benefit of them- selves and their successors. i2"], [22, "4 ENGLISH MUNICIPAL INSTITUTIONS; (4) To have a common seal. (5) To make bye-laws or private statutes for the better govern- ment of the corporation, which are binding upon themselves, unless, contrary to the laws of the land, or inconsistent with their charter, or unreasonable, and then they are void. PART II. The History of the English Municipalities. Municipal Corporations did not exist in England until 1439 ; but although that is the date of the earliest known charter of incorpora tion, boroughs, the citizens of which exercised powers of local self-government, existed from the earliest periods of British history. There is no doubt that such municipalities may be traced back to the Roman occupation of Britain, and the organisation of these seems to have been, at least in part, adopted by the Anglo-Saxons. It is at all events certain that at that time, while the county districts or shires were under the jurisdiction of shire-reeves (whence sheriffs), the boroughs were under the rule of borough- or jw^-reeves. As the counties had their shire-gemotes or sheriffs' towns in which their local affairs were discussed and regulated, so the latter had their burgh-mote or court-leet of the borough. The one assembly was composed of the freeholders of the county, and the other of the freemen resident in the borough. At the time of the Norman conquest the county sheriff was supplanted by the vice-comes, while the borough or port-reeve gave place to the bailiff (or mayor), the new officers being appointed by the king instead of by the free holders or resident freemen, as the case might be. With this exception, however, it would seem that William the Conqueror did not alter the local institutions of the country to the extent that is sometimes imagined. The two leading records which establish this position are the laws compiled by this sovereign and the Domesday Book. In the former the same features are traceable as in the Saxon laws. The king's peace is to be preserved, the freemen are to be sworn to their allegiance, the payment of scot and lot (or local rates) is mentioned, the watch and ward in boroughs is enforced, the provisions of the old law for selling in the presence of witnesses are repeated, as well as the general system of givino pledges for good behaviour which was so remarkable a characteristic"], [23, "THEIR GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT. 5 of the Saxon system. Distinct traces are also to be found of the law which subsequently assumed much greater prominence and contributed so materially to the rise and growth of towns, namely, that \" all bondmen who remained without claim for a year and a day in any borough, &c, should be free.\" In Domesday Book boroughs and burgesses are frequently mentioned, and it is clear from the way in which this is done that the local government of the towns was separate from that of the counties, and that it was vested in the burgesses presided over by a bailiff. At a later period the \" burgesses \" were, in too many boroughs, a small select class, excluding the great mass of the inhabitants from the right of local government, and exercising the powers which they thus obtained for their own profit and advantage. But at this early period the test of municipal citizenship continued to be the same as it was in Saxon times, and, broadly speaking, was in fact very nearly the same as it is at present. An excellent authority* thus refers to burgessship as it existed in the tenth and eleventh centuries : \u2014 \" There are entries in Domesday, in almost every county, which establish that burgessship did not depend upon tenure, because many burgesses are described as belonging to other manors. If tenure was the basis of tlieir right, they would have belonged altogether to the manors, and would not be described of the boroughs, because they did not hold of them. But if residence made them burgesses, then the entry is explained reconcilably with facts, because they would in respect of their resiancy be burgesses in the place of their residence, but would be entered under the manors of which their lands were held. There are, also, numerous instances in which, the burgesses being distinctly connected with their houses, and the latter being ' inhabited,' it is impossible not to infer that they were householders. They paid the custom of gable for tlieir houses, and other taxes. In the entry as to Canterbury, 14 burgesses are mentioned instead of their houses ; and in Thetford, Norwich, and other places, the identity cannot be mistaken. It is also clear from many passages that all the householders were not burgesses. Peers, ecclesiastics, minors, villains, and persons of infamous character were excepted from the privileges and also exempted from the duties of burgessship ; many houses are therefore mentioned in the returns which had not burgesses. Those only who bore their share of the burthens of the place, or, according to the laws of the Saxons and of William the Conqueror, paid scot and bore lot, were entitled to the privileges ; those who from poverty or other cause did not pay the charges or serve the public offices of the borough being excluded. It would have been inconsistent with the whole system of the law at that time if non-residents could have been burgesses ; and therefore we find throughout this document that the burgesses were resident, and in that respect distinguished from the members of the trading companies who might be non-resident.\" A careful examination of Domesday Book shows clearly that at the * Merewether and Stephen's \" History of Boroughs, &c,\" 1833."], [24, "6 ENGLISH MUNICIPAL INSTITUTIONS,* time of its compilation, no municipal corporations were in existence, although several ecclesiastical corporations are mentioned. During the reign of William II. no municipal grants nor any changes in the municipal institutions appear to have been made. Henry I. granted charters to several boroughs, but they were not charters of incorpora tion. They were principally devoted to enlarging the powers of local self-government possessed by the burgesses of the places to which they related. About this period, or soon afterwards, a very important change in their government took place. The bailiff appointed by the king was charged with the duty of assessing and collecting the king's taxes due from the borough. As might have been anticipated, this was often made the cause or pretence of great oppression, and, in order to get rid of it, many towns offered to pay a larger sum than had previously been exacted from them, on condition that they might elect their own chief magistrate and assess them selves. These offers were too tempting to be resisted by sovereigns who were often sorely in want of money, and the towns were thus allowed to re-purchase the right which they had possessed in Saxon times. The elected officer was sometimes called by the old name of port-reeve ; but he was more generally known as the mayor. At this time the merchant guilds who afterwards assumed so large a share in the government of many, perhaps of most municipal corporations, had no connection with the constitution of the boroughs. Down to the reign of Henry VI., the right of burgessship, and, after the boroughs were represented in Parliament, the right of voting for Parliamentary representatives, continued to be vested in the whole body of resident inhabitant householders, being freemen, paying scot and bearing lot, and doing suit and service in the court-leet of the town or city. In the reign of Henry VL, however, a process commenced which gradually transferred the power from the hands of the burgesses generally to various exclusive bodies within the boroughs, and ultimately produced the gravest and most intolerable abuses, which were not swept away until the year 1835. In the year 1439 the first charter of incorporation to a municipal body was granted to Kingston-upon-Hull. Incorporations did not, however, immediately become general, for this charter is followed by others upon the roll which are not of that kind. It is not, indeed, surprising that there was some disinclination on the part of the towns to receive charters of incorporation, because proof is extant that, even at this time, the corporate bodies which then existed had began to abuse the powers given to them, and to make usurpations upon the rights of the"], [25, "7 THEIR GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT. people. To take a single instance of the spirit which was at work: In 1467 it was found that the companies and liveries of London had been making encroachments upon the privileges of the householders in the wardmotes to such an extent that it was necessary for Parlia ment to interfere for the protection of the people. And upon the Parliament roll for the same year there is a petition praying for the dissolution of the tailors' guild at Exeter, on the ground that they set the authority of the mayor at defiance, and threatened to reduce the town to a state of anarchy. But although the boroughs showed but slight desire for incorporation, the courts of law were determined to thrust it upon them. In 1466 the Court of Common Pleas laid the foundation of a doctrine from which important results subse quently flowed \u2014 that of the creation of corporations by inference or implication \u2014 by holding that, \" If the king gave land in fee-farm to the good men of the town of Dale, the corporation was good. And so likewise when it was given to the burgesses, citizens, and commonalty, &c.\" The principle of this decision was afterwards extended, and the charters of our early kings, which merely conferred the right of local self-government upon boroughs, were then con strued as charters of incorporation, with very mischievous conse quences, as was thereafter seen. The increasing importance of the House of Commons under the Tudor sovereigns made these princes exceedingly anxious to establish an ascendancy in that assembly. The first mode adopted was to issue writs for the return of members of Parliament to small or decayed towns in which the king or some of bis courtiers could exercise a commanding influence. This course was taken to some extent by Henry VIII., and to a much greater extent by Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth ; but the House of Commons at last intervened, and succeeded in putting a stop to these arbitrary and fraudulent enfranchisement of dependent boroughs. The Crown then resorted to another device. As there was no doubt that the right of election belonged to the burgesses, it was clear that if the general body of inhabitant householders could be deprived of their privileges, and if these could be handed over to some select knot who would be under the dictation of the Crown or of some great men in the neighbourhood, the end in view would be obtained as effectually as by the creation of new nomination boroughs. Accordingly, new charters were granted to a number of boroughs. In these the doctrine of the existence of corporations by implication was expanded into that of corporations by prescription. It was falsely recited that they had been incorporated from time immemorial,"], [26, "8 ENGLISH MUNICIPAL INSTITUTIONS \\ and under this pretext, and under that of confirming ancient usage, the right of burgessship was either limited to a select and self electing body, or was extended \u2014 and this was quite as mischievous \u2014 to non-fesidents, who were admitted by the governing bodies of the boroughs to the freedom of the town. At the same time \u2014 in the reign of Queen Elizabeth \u2014 the judges by their decision in the celebrated Corporations case with respect to the validity of electors and as to the binding effect of bye-laws made by select bodies in the corporations, laid the foundation for further and, as the result proved, almost indefinite encroachment upon the rights of the burgesses. Stating the matter broadly, it may be said that the effect of these innovations was to deprive the municipalities of their character of local institutions, and to subject them in their character of corporations \u2014 the creatures of the law \u2014 to the manipu lation of judges who were, at this period and during the reigns of the Stuarts, bitterly hostile to popular rights, and equally bent upon extending in every way the influence of the crown. It is true that in the reign of James I. an effort was made to check a process by which the right of burgessship, and consequently the right to the franchise, was being gradually involved in inextricable confusion. The famous election committee, presided over by Serjeant Gian ville, decided \" that of common right the burgesses were the inhabitant householders, resident, paying scot and lot ;\" but this decision was lost sight of, or, at any rate, it was never acted upon in the revolutionary times which followed ; and, after the Restoration, during the reigns of Charles II. and James II., the process of remodelling the corporations was resumed and prosecuted with augmented vigour. In the words of the learned writers already quoted (and who are entitled to the merit of being the first to place the history of English municipal incorporations on a sound basis) \u2014 \" The interference in the reigns of Elizabeth and James I. by charters of the crown \u2014 the decisions of the courts, and the acquiescence of the people \u2014 had merged all the borough privileges and jurisdictions in the general notion of corporations ; and as by these means all their rights were brought under the influence and control of the Crown, the subsequent attack upon them was made comparatively easy. On the Restoration the statute passed for the correction of the corporations afforded ready means for that attack, and a pretext for every species of usurpation. Extensive use was made of the opportunity ; the old members and officers of the corporations were dis placed ; ministers of the crown, officers of state, and non-residents were substituted ; and from the proceedings upon the statute it is obvious that no corporation had any chance of continuing its existence but by a submissive compliance with the wishes of the king. * * * After the success of the"], [27, "THEIR GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT. 9 London quo warranto, the king sent his officers into all parts of the kingdom to terrify the corporations by the threats of similar legal proceedings to give up their charters. The greater portion of them voluntarily surrendered them through the agency of the select bodies, on the promise of having jiew grants from the crown ; against those who were refractory proceedings were instituted. So that at this time the borough rights, which by general misconception and practice had been assumed to be identified with the corporations, were by the acts of the corporations and the surrender or seizure of the corporations sub mitted entirely to the mercy of the crown.\" There is no doubt that his dealings with the corporations contri buted in no slight degree to the downfall of James II. But, although William III. did not imitate his predecessors, he did nothing to correct the abuses which had grown up under them. Indeed, during his reign and those of his successors, much was done to perpetuate and to extend those abuses \u2014 not, indeed, by the king, whose interference with corporate rights and privileges ceased with the Revolution of 1688, but by the House of Commons and the courts of law. Again quoting the before-mentioned authority, we find \u2014 \" The first (Parliament) in the reign of William IIL passed the Act compelling the sheriffs to make the return from the elections according to the rights which had last been determined by the House of Commons, by which means the varying and anomalous usages of the different boroughs and the contradictory decisions of committees were sanctioned and confirmed. The House of Com mons also \u2014 by its resolution \u2014 supported the former decisions, however irrecon cilable with the charters or the principles of our institutions ; and in some instances under the general name of ' burgesses,' introduced new varieties, according to the agreement of parties or the absurd usages of places that were brought before them. The courts of law relied upon the few early cases to which we have referred, and the extra-judicial opinions in the reigns of Elizabeth and James ; and they fell into the same course which the House of Commons and the legislature had taken, adopting the same rules, by which they avoided a discrepancy which might have existed injurious to the character of both, as well as detrimental to the people. The courts, therefore, upheld the same prin ciples, supported usage, maintained the select bodies, sanctioned the non residents, confirmed numerous bye-laws not in accordance with the charters or with each other, but giving a different constitution to every different borough, and as the greatest and worst innovation of all, gave tjie stamp of judicial authority to the doctrine of the arbitrary admission of burgesses by the corporations, a principle wliich had not before been expressly sanctioned by legal decisions. * * * During the reigns of Queen Anne, George I., IL, IIL, and IV., the abuses to which we have referred were fully maintained. Select bodies, common councils, their bye-laws, and non-residents were supported. Freemen were substituted for ' burgesses,' and the latter name was applied to burgage tenants, freeholders, pot- wallers, and inhabitants without any other qualification. The court-leet was neglected, its proceedings disregarded or misapplied. Instead of them, courts baron were brought into a prominent situation in the municipal"], [28, "10 ENGLISH MUNICIPAL INSTITUTIONS ; government of boroughs, for which they were never intended. Trade, and the companies and liveries connected with it, particularly in London, were more interwoven with the rights of burgessship than the original constitution of boroughs would justify ; and the unrestrained admission of freemen as burgesses, wliich was declared to be lawful, laid all the municipal privileges and jurisdiction at the feet of those of whatever party who happen to possess the influence necessary to secure the admission of their friends. Hence in some places a sufficient number of non-resident honorary freemen were admitted to overawe or neutralise the votes of the real burgesses ; making in this manner the important functions of the separate exclusive jurisdictions of boroughs not the means of local government, as they were intended to be, but the tools of party violence and private intrigue.\" The general result of these innovations \u2014 for so they may be justly described \u2014 was that the municipal corporations were, for the most part, in the hands of narrow and self-elected cliques, who administered local affairs for their own advantage, rather than for that of the borough ; that the inhabitants were practically deprived of all power of local self-government, and were ruled by those whom they had not chosen, and in whom they had no confidence; that the corporate funds were wasted ; that the interests and the improvements of towns were not cared for; that the local courts were too often corrupted by party influence, and failed to render impartial justice ; and that municipal institutions, instead of strengthening and sup porting the political framework of the country, were a source of weakness and a fertile cause of discontent. Such was the condition of the English municipalities until the year 1835, when Parliament restored to the inhabitants of the boroughs those rights which their remote ancestors had enjoyed, but of which they had been deprived by a long series of usurpations. PART III. The Acts or Parliament relating to the English Municipal Corporations, from 1835 to 1878 inclusive, with an Outline of their General Purport. The passing of the Parliamentary Reform Bill of 1832 may be said to have foreshadowed the necessary change in the municipal institu tions of the country which shortly followed. In many instances its provisions affected the very existence of the corporations whose municipal privileges had been almost solely exercised for the furtherance of political objects ; and there can be little doubt that"], [29, "11 THEIR growth and development. the opinion which generally prevailed, as to municipal corporations having provided the most convenient machinery for the wide-spread corruption appertaining to the parliamentary franchise, was a just one. In compliance with an address from the House of Commons, a Royal Commission was issued, on the 18th day of July, 1833, directing a searching inquiry to be made \"as to the existing state of the Municipal Corporations in England and Wales, and to collect information respecting the defects in their constitution.\" The Report of the Commissioners, signed by sixteen out of the nineteen originally appointed (one having died in the course of the inquiry, and two failing to concur in all the statements submitted), was presented to Parliament at the commencement of the Session of 1835. On the 9th of September, in the same year, the Royal Assent was given to the Bill now so well known as the Act 5 and 6 William IV., cap. 76. It did not apply, as is often supposed, to the whole of the corporations. The total number of places where an inquiry was instituted was 285 ; but, of these, 39 possessed corporations with few municipal functions worthy of the name. Of the 246 places believed to be in the possession of, or exercising, municipal powers, 178 were set out in the schedules defining the application of the Act ; the remaining 68 (including the city of London) were not brought within its scope \u2014 London because it was reserved for future legis lation, and the others because they were inconsiderable in extent and population. These particular boroughs still continue to be governed by their charters or prescriptive usages (except where incorporation has taken place under the Act,* or the special privileges comprised in their charters have been allowed to lapse), and each may therefore be said to be a law in itself. The Act of 1835 swept away at a stroke all previous charters, usages, and rights inconsistent with itself, and placed the constitution and the powers of the muni cipal corporations named in its schedules upon a simple, uniform, and popular basis. There had previously been great absence of uniformity with reference to the naming of the corporations ; but the Act provided \" That after the first election of councillors under this Act in any borough, the body or reputed body corporate named in the said schedule in connection with such borough shall take and bear the names of the mayor, aldermen, and burgesses of such borough, and by that name shall have perpetual succession, and shall be capable by the council hereinafter mentioned [the town * Five of these boroughs \u2014 Aberavon, Conway, Hartlepool, Hedon, and Yeovil \u2014 have been placed under the Act since 1835,"], [30, "12 ENGLISH MUNICIPAL INSTITUTIONS ; council] to do and suffer all acts wiiich now lawfully they and their successors respectively may do and suffer by any name or title of incorporation ; and the mayor of each of the said boroughs shall be capable in law to do and suffer all acts which the chief officer of such borough may now lawfully do and suffer so far as the same respectively are not altered or annulled by the provisions of this Act.\" The courts of law have fully settled that, although the name of the corporation be changed, as in many cases it is by the operation of this section, yet that the effect of the statute is not to create a new corporation in any case, but merely to continue the old corporation, so that all the rights, claims, franchises, privileges, prescriptions, and customs, as well as all the debts, liabilities, and duties of the corporation as it stood on the day the statute passed, remain and inhere in the remodelled corporation so far as they are not contrary to or inconsistent with the provisions of the Act. A careful consideration of the 6th, 137th, and 142nd sections ofthe Act seems, however, to render it perfectly clear that the substitution of the word \" citizens \" for \" burgesses \" in corporations of cities is both legal and proper. This subject was recently suggested for discussion (and determination by an important civic body) in an interesting pamphlet,* which quotes judicial opinions in favour of the term \"citizens,\" and not \"burgesses,\" being employed in the corporate style of cities. Inclusive of the principal Acts, the number of legislative measures, directly applicable to municipal corporations, which were entered on the Statute roll between the years 1835 and 1878, is 31. They are as follows : \u2014 * \" On the distinctive style and title of the Corporation of the City of Exeter \"\u2014 B. C. Gidley, M.A., Town Clerk. Session, Chapter and Year. Title of Act.

The general purport of the above-named laws may be thus briefly summarized : \u2014 (a) To constitute a corporation composed of a mayor, aldermen, and burgesses, acting by a council in which the general body of burgesses are represented by from twelve to sixty-four members thereof. The burgesses, by which term is indicated those indi viduals enjoying the privilege of voting, consist of householders within the borough (residents within seven miles of it, and payers of borough and poor rates) ; an occupancy of not less than twelve months is necessary, and nen-payment of rates or accep tance of poor relief entails deprivation of the franchise. The register of voters, or \" burgess roll,\" is prepared annually, and in boroughs which are both municipal and parliamentary, settled by a revising barrister (41 & 42 Viet. c. 26) ; in boroughs which are municipal only that duty devolves upon"], [33, "15 THEIR GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT. the mayor, aided by two annually-elected assessors. The burgesses elect the councillors by ballot (35 & 36 Yict. c. 33) on the First of November in each year, and the council choose the aldermen (one for every three councillors) and the mayor. The councillors hold office for three years, the aldermen for six years, and the mayor for one year. The qualification for a councillor or alderman is \u00a31,000 property or \u00a330 rating, if the borough was before the year 1869 divided into four or more wards, or \u00a3500 property or \u00a315 rating in other cases, and residence within fifteen miles of the borough. In such boroughs as are divided into wards the councillors are apportioned among and separately elected in the several wards. A person may be chosen an alderman although he has not been elected a councillor, but the mayor must be selected from the aldermen or councillors. By virtue of his appointment the mayor becomes a justice of the peace for the borough during his tenure of office and one year after. There are certain monetary penalties, limited in amount, for the non-acceptance of office. (b) To provide for the performance of the following functions (amongst others of a minor character) : \u2014 \u25a0 (1) Administration of justice in local criminal and civil courts. (2) Appointment and supervision of police. (3) Administration of public property and the levy of rates when such property is not sufficient to meet the public expenses. (4) The enactment of bye-laws and appointment and dis- missal of public servants. (5) Execution of sanitary regulations under the Public Health Acts. (6) Paving, lighting, supplying water, cleansing, and maintenance and improvement of thoroughfares and sewerage. (7) Establishment and maintenance of public buildings, works, museums, and libraries. (8) Making and maintaining harbours, docks, and navigations. (9) Administration of special charitable trusts. (10) Superintendence and enforcement of educational regu- lation where there is no school board. Several of the foregoing duties will be more fully referred to under the sub-divisions of Part IV."], [34, "16 ENGLISH MUNICIPAL INSTITUTIONS ; PART IV. The Growth and Development of the English Municipalities (subject to 5 & 6 Will. IV. c. 76), between 1835 and 1879, statistically illustrated under the following heads : \u2014 (1) Area. (2) Population and Inhabited Houses. (3) The Municipal Franchise. (4) The Parliamentary Franchise. (5) The Governing Body. (6) The Municipal Judges and Magistracy.

(10) The Public Health and Educational Jurisdictions. (1) Ake a. A comparison of the territorial limits subject to corporate juris- diction before the passing of the Act 5 and 6 William IV. c. 76, and those of the present time, may, not unreasonably, be regarded as the least satisfactory test of the extension of municipal government during the last forty-three years. The contrast only becomes of value when calculated from the date upon which the boundaries of the 178 cities and boroughs, named in schedules A and B of the Act of 1835, may be said to have received a certain settled definition. The limits of many of the ancient boroughs underwent considerable alteration, some being increased, and some decreased, by the operation of sections 7 and 8 of the Act, which prescribed that the metes and bounds of the several boroughs, named in the first section of Schedules A and B, should ba the same as those settled and described by 2 and 3 William IV. c. 64, intituled \" An Act to settle and describe the Divisions of Counties, and the limits of Cities and Boroughs, in England and Wales, so far as respects the Election of Members to serve in Parliament.\" The Municipal Inquiry Commissioners found, in the course of their investigations in 1833, that the boundaries of the corporate"], [35, "17 their growth and development. jurisdictions were generally known with tolerable accuracy, although principally ascertained by periodical perambulations. Occasionally, doubts and disputes occurred with regard to small parcels of land, in which county, manorial, or parochial authorities felt themselves interested, and this confusion was not surprising, especially when the metes of such parcels of ground were not continuous with the corporate boundary, as at Erocon, Grantham, and other places. The Cinque Ports supplied some remarkable instances of outlying limits. The magistrates of Hastings had authority over the precincts of Beaksbourne, and Grange (or Grench), distant from the town 48 and 50 miles respectively, and the towns of Deal and Ramsgate (the former a corporate town of itself) were subject to the jurisdiction of the corporation of Sandwich. Many of the cathedral cities possessed precincts locally situated within the limits of the corporate authority, but entirely exempted by ecclesiastical charters, or grants of privileges, from its jurisdiction. Several corporations, too, exercised powers over adjacent waters to considerable distances from their land boundaries ; the jurisdiction of Rochester extended on the Medway to Sheerness, distant twenty miles ; that of Bristol to Holmes, twenty five miles from the city ; New castle-upon-Tyne had jurisdiction on ten miles of the river below the town and seven above it ; and a larg-e portion of the harbour of Harwich was within the jurisdiction of Ipswich. The inlying precincts frequently gave rise to grave evils, by affording protection to offenders against the law, and presenting irritating obstacles to an effective police supervision. Great incon venience, moreover, resulted in cases where the rapid increase of population had not met with a corresponding extension of the corporate area. The sections of the principal Act, mentioned in the preceding paragraph, swept away the anomalies of outlying and inlying precincts, but the concluding words of the seventh section, that \" the metes and bounds of every borough and county corporate, should include the whole of the liberties of the borough or county as the same were then taken to be \" provoked considerable divergence of opinion. The extensive meaning of the word \" Liberties,\" brought within the temporary boundary of several boroughs a large tract of continuous territory which ought never to have been annexed to them. The majority of the Revising Barristers, appointed under section 20, in the discharge of the duties entrusted to them by section 39, no doubt interpreted the seventh section in accordance with the intent of the framers of the Act, by excluding these peculiar districts (see Doncaster and York, in Col. 1, Table 1.) when determining the said c"], [36, "18 ENGLISH MUNICIPAL INSTITUTIONS ; divisions, but the technical objection taken to their ruling was ulti mately held to be fatal to the limitation, and necessitated a special enactment (6 & 7 William IV., c. 103), which provided that \u2014 \" Notwithstanding anything contained in the Municipal Corporation Act, no part of any county, or of the liberties of any borough, town, or city named in the first section of the schedules (A and B) annexed to the said Act, which before the passing thereof was not part of such borough, town, or city, or within the parlia mentary boundary thereof, should be taken thereafter to be within the boundaries of such borough, <tc, or within the county thereof, or within the jurisdiction of the justices thereof, and that no part of any county, or of the liberties of any borough, town, or city named in the second section of the said schedules (A & B), which was not part of such borough, town, or city, before the passing of the Act (2 & 3 William IV., c. 64) to settle the boundaries of parliamentary boroughs, should for the purposes of the Municipal Corporations Act be included within the boundaries of any such borough, &c, or with the county of such borough, (fee, or within the jurisdiction of the justices of such borough, <fec.\" The real effect of this statute was to make the parliamentary and the municipal boundaries of the first set of boroughs co-extensive, and to confine the latter within their old municipal limits. The Act just quoted was, contrary to general expectation, the only legislation, beyond sections 7 and 8 of the principal Act, which ensued upon the question of municipal boundaries. The character which the Bill for regulating Municipal Corporations would assume with respect to warding, &c, on becoming law, being pretty well understood by Midsummer of 1835, a Royal Commission was issued on the 15th of July in that year, directing an inquiry \"into the local circumstances of certain cities, boroughs, cinque ports, and municipal corporations in England and Wales, touching the metes and bounds of such cities, boroughs, &c, and the preparation of a report, within three months from that date, upon the lines most proper to be adopted for new metes and bounds of the same.\" The general instructions to the Commissioners were of the following purport : \u2014 1st. To fix the boundaries of the cities, or boroughs so as to include all houses in each city or borough town and its suburbs. 2nd. In the case of a suburb not being immediately contiguous, regard to be had to the nature of the population of such suburb, and the extent and nature of the ground separating it from the town. 3rd. No suburb to be included within a municipal boundary without the ground dividing it from the town being also included. 4th. Old boundaries to be adhered to where practicable but where"], [37, "19 THEIR GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT. too extensive or too limited other lines adapted to the existing circumstances of the town to be laid down. 5th. Attention to be paid in altering existing boundaries to the selection of parish bounds or long established local limits. As may be imagined, it was found to be a difficult task to apply these principles rigourously to so many boroughs varying widely in character and circumstances, and in the result the recommendations of the Commissioners \u2014 so far as the corporate areas were concerned \u2014 practically resolved themselves into : \u2014 lst. The extension of boundaries where the population, houses, &c, had outgrown (or gave reasonable promise of so doing) the ancient limits. 2nd. A curtailment of boundaries where there was any con- siderable exteut of rural district included within the ancient limits. The proposed augmentations of area were, upon the whole, approved by the inhabitants of the districts affected, but the sugges tions as to the contraction of boundaries were by no means well received. The numerous expressions of local dissatisfaction thereon, and the excusable disinclination of the central authority to the obliteration of \" landmarks \" which had existed in a large proportion of the boroughs from \" time immemorial\" were effectual in pre venting Parliamentary adoption of the Commissioners' delimitations, notwithstanding the very sensible basis upon which they had been arranged. Contractions of ancient fines in defining the Parliamentary boundaries under the Parliamentary Reform Act of 1832, it should be remembered, were forbidden. Sections 7 and 8 of 5 and 6 William IV., c. 76, and the leading provisions of 6 and 7 William IV., c. 103, may, therefore, be said to have permanently defined the boundaries of the 178 reformed municipalities. Extensions of corporate limits have since taken place under special Acts of Parliament. Of the Cities and Boroughs named in Schedules A and B of the Act of 1835 the following have had their boundaries altered or extended since the passing of that measure : \u2014 Gloucester Hythe Kingston- upon-Thames Newbury N e wca stle-un der- Lyme Newport (I. of Wight) Newport (Monmouth) Nottingham Bridgwater Cardiff Chichester Coventry Derby Exeter Folkestone Gateshead c 2"], [38, "20 ENGLISH MUNICIPAL INSTITUTIONS ; Stockton-on-Tees Sunderland Walsall Pontefract Retford (East) Romsey Stafford Of the Cities and Boroughs incorporated since the year 1835 the following have had their boundaries altered or extended : \u2014 Barrow-in-Furness Blackburn Bolton Bootle-cum-Linacre Bradford Brighton Darlington Halifax Huddersfield Manchester Margate Middlesborough Rochdale Salford Southport The piecemeal system of legislation for local affairs, which has been so long pursued, has been fruitful in multiplying the many abnormal relations of a municipal \"citizen\" or \"burgess\" to the \"authorities\" which control his domestic government, and peculiarities arising from the absence of a general principle in defining borough bound aries are not the least conspicuous. In very many instances the areas divide parishes and unions, and in fourteen cases, counties. They are often not conterminous with the parliamentary borough or the urban district bearing the same name. The effect has been fairly stated thus : \u2014 \" The inhabitant of a borough lives in a fourfold area for purposes of local government, namely, in the borough, in a parish, in a union, and in a county. None of these are conterminous (unless by accident) with any of the others. He is or may be governed by a sixfold authority, namely, the council, the vestry, the burial board, the school board, the union, and the county quarter sessions \u2014 all different bodies \u2014 and inliabitants of different parts of the same borough are or may be under different vestries, burial boards, guardians, and county quarter sessions. He is or may be subject to a borough-rate, a general district-rate, a poor-rate, a burial- rate, and a county- rate. ' ' * Before concluding the observations prompted by this subject, it may not be out of place to remark that every care has been taken, in settling the approximate number of statute acres within the ancient municipal limits, to be as accurate as the information at command would permit. Of nearly a dozen authorities consulted, scarcely any two agree, and the precise measurements of the last Ordnance Survey appear to have exposed several numerical errors in previous authori tative declarations of local limits. An examination of Table I. will shew some slight differences that may be thus accounted for. * \" Memorandum on Local Government,\" W. Eathbone and S.

The Tables under this head, although not affording much latitude for introductory observations, supply valuable information as to the increased influence of reformed municipal government. Of the 285 places where an inquiry was instituted by the Municipal Commissioners, 246 [as stated at page 11] advanced satisfactory reasons for believing them to be in the possession of (or exercising) municipal functions, but certain boroughs, having quasi-municipal"], [46, "28 ENGLISH MUNICIPAL INSTITUTIONS ; institutions, brought up the whole number of places enjoying chartered or prescriptive municipal privileges to 263. The aggregate population contained within the old corporate limits of these boroughs was 2,110,186; but that of the actual towns and suburbs was 3,907,177. These figures were based upon the census of 1831, and included those for the metropolis. The population within the city walls was then 122,395 ; but that of the city and its suburbs, combined, 1,511,586. Excluding London (still an unreformed corporation) and its suburbs, the total population in the provinces residing within municipal jurisdictions was 1,987,791, and that within the actual municipal towns and their suburbs, 2,395,591. The estimated population brought within the amended boundaries of the 178 reformed cities and boroughs, on the 1st of November, 1835, calculated on the census of 1831, was 2,193,407 (Col. 4\u2014 Table 1) ; the estimated population of the 240 cities and boroughs now under the Act, on the 1st of March, 1879, was 8,152,444 (Col. 7\u2014 Tables 1 and 2.) It follows, as a matter of course, that the current population figures for many of those boroughs \u2014 set out in Table 1 \u2014 which were confined to their ancient limits by the provisions of 5 and 6 Will., c. 76, and 6 and 7 Will. IV., cap. 103, do not represent the number of inhabitants contained with the actual towns and their suburbs. Stratford-upon-Avon may be cited as shewing a fair case in point. In 1835 even, the houses and population had outgrown the corporate area, and the Commissioners recommended a boundary embracing a population of about 4,312 persons, and 975 qualifying houses, the excess of population resident in the town, but not in the borough, being 824. The estimated population of the town in 1879 is 7,000 ; that of the borough, 3,863 \u2014 the same as shewn by the census of 1871 (or a difference of 3,137).* Columns 2 and 3 of Table 1 have been compiled from the Census Returns of the year 1831, but the corrected figures of tbe Inquiry and Boundary Commissioners have, wherever they occur, been inserted; Column 3 from the report of the Inquiry Commission ers ; Columns 5 and 6 from the Census Returns of 1871 ; and Column 7 is the result of an application to the principal officials of each city or borough, made so recently as the 1st of March in the present year (1879). Where the answer with respect to this column has been \" same as 1871,\" or \"little or no alteration from 1871,\" the totals of the Census Report of that year have been inserted for 1879. * The Town Council are promoting a Bill in the present session of Parliament (1879), for the extension of the corporate area over the whole town."], [47, "THEIR GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT. 29 TABLE 1.

The true condition of the Municipal Franchise, previous to the year 1835, has been already briefly referred to (see pages 4 to 10). The principal Table of this section further illustrates the many vicissitudes and deteriorations to which the popular right of self-government was subjected during successive periods of English history, and but few additional details are needed to make the contrast between the old and new order of things perfectly clear. Although great obscurity surrounds the early constitution of the English municipalities, there are valid reasons for believing that the \" freemen\" or \"burgesses at large\" were the governing body. The Anglo-Saxon forms of local organization were legitimate ramifications of the common-law rights of the free population. Under the con- solidated rule of the renowned Alfred and his two able successors, Edward and Athelstan, the burgh-motes \u2014 as well as the shire-motes \u2014 became integral portions of the State, charged with essential duties to their immediate communities and responsible obligations to the witena-gemot, or national council. The individuals composing these communal associations were men who had a stake \u2014 inconsiderable though it may frequently have been \u2014 in the country, or, in homely words, \" had something to lose ;\" hence the irresistible impulses which d 2"], [54, "36 ENGLISH MUNICIPAL INSTITUTIONS \\ in later times compelled despotic administrators, much against their will, to formally recognise the enjoyment of \" peculiar privileges \" which had thereto been exercised as \" undisputed rights.\" It does not appear that the \" borough liberties \" of the Anglo-Saxons de pended for their origination upon the favour of the Sovereign. They were the natural outgrowth of social necessities. The Municipal Commissioners, in their report, adduced only two instances of grants of local charters by Saxon kings \u2014 that of Athelstan to Beverley and that of Edward the Confessor to the Cinque Ports \u2014 neither of which, from the alleged nature of their contents, can be accepted as satis factory evidence of the creation of municipal franchises by mon archical condescension prior to the Norman era. Notwithstanding the slight interference of the Conqueror and his immediate successors with the local institutions of the subjugated country, the introduction of the feudal systems of the continent gradually but surely obliterated the free peasantry, and transferred their independent jurisdictions to the Lords of the Manors. The principal towns were reserved to the Crown, and were known as \" Eoyal boroughs \" or \" boroughs of ancient demesne \" ; the inhabitants held their town at fee-farm, undisturbed by the king's officers, and continued, with few exceptions, in possession of their ancient freedoms. The earliest charters were, invariably, simple con- firmations of old customs and liberties; special immunities were sometimes conferred, but they were chiefly such as regarded the burgesses in their external relations. What the inhabitants mainly secured in their contracts with the king, in addition to their primary privileges was \u2014 freedom from servile duties; free trade and exemption from toll in every part of the king's dominions ; that all the land within their limits should be the property of the community \u2014 such as was not already occupied by tenements to form common land, of which portions might be saved for building, &c, to the profit of the community and the improvement of the town ; that the burgesses should answer to the king for his ferm by their own appointed chief officer ; that the profits arising from fines, &c, in the borough courts, should be applied to the common benefit of the townsmen ; and that they should be untrammelled in their choice of a mayor, bailiff, or portreeve. These were the examples of municipal enfranchisement usually cited by the barons in their charters to the smaller towns which they held in fief from the king or those which sprang up under the walls of their castles. The extinction of feudalism eventually brought these baronial boroughs under the direct authority of the Crown."], [55, "37 THEIR GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT. Upon the early constitution of the municipal corporations the Inquiry Commissioners in their report observe : \u2014 \" It is certain that many of these institutions were established in practice long before they were settled by law.\" \" In some places, as at Newcastle-Upon-Tyne, Carlisle, and Scarborough, the forms of the Municipal Government were defined by an express composition between the magistracy and the people. It is probable that the powers of government in all ordinary cases were exercised by the superior magistracy, but that in extraordinary emergencies the whole body of burgesses were called upon to sanction the measures which interested the community. The difficulty of conducting business in such an assembly seems to have suggested the expedient of appointing a species of committee out of the larger body, which acted in con junction with the burgesses, and which was dissolved when the business was concluded. * * * We have not discovered that there was any general principle in the mode of forming the constituency of the boroughs, nor can we assume that one system of policy or common law right prevailed at any period throughout the realm. * * * * It is sufficient that we are enabled to collect the main principles of administration, namely, that the municipal magistracy and municipal councils were the resident and effective heads of the community, and that the community probably included in its members, all who shared in its burthens, and were liable to fill its offices.\" The above extract plainly shows the close assimilation of the ancient and modern municipal franchises. The opinions of two learned writers as to the qualifications of a \"freeman\" or \"burgess\" have been already quoted (see page 5), but another and no less valuable authority* thus intelligibly defines a \" townsman \" or \" freeman,\" \u2014 \" They were deemed townsmen who had a settled dwelling in the town, who merchandized there, who were of the hans (hans-hus) or hanse-house,\" (being a designation for the hall of the Common Mercatory Guild similar to that which formed the germ of the institutions of the Hanse Towns) who were in scot and lot, and who used and enjoyed the liberties and free customs of the town.\" The freedom of a borough was obtained under a variety of forms, which, however, may be included under the following general titles, \u2014 Gift by the Governing Body, Purchase, Birth, Marriage, Servitude, Membership of Trade Guilds, and Possession or Occupancy of House or Land Property. * Madox\u2014 Firma Burgi, p. 269."], [56, "38 ENGLISH MUNICIPAL INSTITUTIONS ; By far the greater number of claims were acquired by birth, marriage, or servitude. This distinctive class of the people lost little of its power until the reign of Henry VI. , when commenced those insidious encroachments on the part of the Crown which, by degrees, entirely deprived the freemen, in nearly every borough, of many of their most cherished functions. With the rapid extension of the pernicious principles of self-election to the ruling bodies, constituted by charters of in corporation, the value of freemanship was almost wholly reduced to eligibility to corporate offices, and a share in the election of members of parliament. The minor benefits which remained outside these \" rights \" were stated by the Inquiry Commissioners to \"consist in exemption from the tolls and duties which in many towns are levied under various grants from the Crown. In the greater number of towns the privilege extends only to those tolls levied by their own corporation ; the freemen of some corporations claim and are allowed to be free in certain cases from those of other towns ; a very few claim an universal exemption. The freemen are also very generally excused from serving on County Juries ; this exemption is often enjoyed by all the inhabitants of corporate towns. They have sometimes exclusive privileges in the local courts, * * * and in many places the exclusivive right of trading within corporate limits. Another privilege often belonging to the freemen is, that they or their widows or children are designated as the sole objects of local charities.\" Having thus far elucidated the prominent features of the ancient municipal franchise, the annexed table, showing the number of Royal Charters of Privileges and Governing Charters mentioned in the Report of the Inquiry Commissioners as having been obtained by municipal boroughs from the reign of William the Conqueror downwards, will be found interesting.

Schedule A sets out all the boroughs which were then intended to have a commission of the peace, arranging them in two sections, \u2014 section 1, comprising those of which the boundaries were to be those of the parliamentary borough until otherwise provided by Parliament ; and section 2, those which were to retain their existing municipal boundaries. Schedule B sets out the boroughs which were not to have a commission of the peace, unless on petition and grant, arranging them in a similar way, in two sections. For obvious reasons, the three important points which present themselves in the present subdivision of this work are treated of under distinct heads, namely, (1.) The incorporation of boroughs; (2.) The quali fications for the franchise; (3.) The burgess roll and its preparation. *(1.) The Incorporation of Boroughs. \u2014 By 5 and 6 William IV. c. 76, s. 141, if the inhabitant householders of any town or borough in England or Wales, petition for a charter of in corporation, it is lawful for the Crown (by the advice of the Privy Council), to extend to the inhabitants of any such town or borough, within the district to be set forth in such charter, the powers and permissions contained in the Municipal Corporations Act. Notice of every such petition, and of the time when it will be taken into consideration by the Privy Council, must, however, be published in the London Gazette one month at least before such consideration takes place. The Crown has always possessed the privilege of creating corpora tions and conferring franchises ; but when privileges and powers are to be conferred which are not recognised by the common or statute law, an Act of Parliament is necessary. This section (that in the Municipal Corporations Act relative to the incorporation of new boroughs), although it does not at all abridge the common law prero- * The analysis of the Acts of Parliament affecting Municipal Corporations (through out this work) must not be accepted as exhaustive, otherwise than in reference to the subject immediately under notice. The amending or repealing Acts are cited in their chronological order."], [59, "41 THEIK GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT. gative of the Crown, prevents it granting charters of incorporation with the powers conferred by this Act, save with the advice of the Privy Council, and on petition by the inhabitant householders.* The powers of the Crown in regard to the grant of charters of incorporation, and the mode in which these powers are to be exercised, are, however, so important, that it will be useful to state in a summary manner the propositions affirmed by the Court of Queen's Bench in the leading case on the subject \u2014 that of the incorporation of Manchester (reported as Rutter v. Chapman, 8 M. & W. 1). It was there held \u2014 I. That the grant of a charter of municipal incorporation is still an exercise of the common law prerogative of the Crown, although such charter invests the corporation with the functions oonferred by the Act upon the then existing municipal corporations. II. That the Crown may grant the charter to a part only (to be defined therein) of a town or borough, and need not grant it to the whole of the inhabitants of such town or borough, although the prayer of the petition is for a grant of a charter of incorporation to the inhabitant householders of the said borough. III. That a petition, to be within the meaning of the Acts, need not proceed from a majority of the inhabitant householders of the place or of the male inhabitant householders of the place. IV. That whether such petition was, under all the circumstances, the petition of the inhabitant householders within the meaning of the Acts, is a question of fact for a jury. V. That when the whole number of the inhabitant householders was 48,000, and a petition was presented to the Crown signed by 4,000 in favour of a grant of a charter of incorporation, and another was subsequently presented by 6,000 against it, the jury were quite right in their verdict, that the former petition expressed the wish of the inhabitant householders within the meaning of the Acts ; (the direction of the learned judge at the trial being that, notwithstanding such last petition, the Crown had power, in his opinion, to grant the charter by virtue of the first petition, which direction was also correct.) VI. That the Crown, in the charter, besides defining the district within which the powers and jurisdiction of the corporation are to be exercised, may, by its common law prerogative, appoint the number and set out the wards of the new borough. VII. That a charter so granted was valid (having been accepted) ; but that the determination of the Privy Council to advise the Crown to grant the charter is not decisive of the question as to the sufficiency of the petition in favour of the charter. VIII. That the Crown may, in the charter, delegate to an individual the power of appointing the first members of the corporate body ; or may at all events appoint a person to ascertain who are the individuals possessed of the * \" Under the word ' persons,' \" says a learned commentator upon the Act of 1835, \" it is apprehended that a corporation would be included, and would consequently be entitled to the protection afforded by this section.\" In several cases the word \" person,\" in a similar clause as to actions, has been held to include an incorporated company."], [60, "42 ENGLISH MUNICIPAL INSTITUTIONS ; qualifications which the corporations are to have ; in other words, who are to be burgesses ; and may appoint, in the charter, another person to revise the list of burgesses, and to act as the returning officer at the first election of officers under the charter. Section 49, of 7 William IV. and 1 Victoria, c. 78, re-enacted with verbal amendments, section 141 of the Act of 1835. The Act 40 and 41 Victoria, c. 69, effected several changes in the procedure of petitioning for, and granting of, municipal charters. It provides, that, \u2014 * \" If on the petition to Her Majesty of the inhabitant householders of any town or towns or district in England, or of any of those inhabitants, praying for the grant of a charter of incorporation, Her Majesty, by the advice of Her Privy Council, thinks fit by charter to create such town, towns, or district, or any part thereof specified in the charter, with or without any adjoining place, a municipal borough, and to incorporate the inhabitants thereof, it shall be lawful for Her Majesty by the charter to extend to that municipal borough and the inhabitants thereof so incorporated the provisions of the Municipal Corporation Acts, except such Acts or such parts of such Acts as relate to the assessing or levying rates, or as impose any charge thereon, t Every petition for a charter under this Act shall be referred to a committee ofthe lords of Her Majesty's Privy Council (in this Act referred to as the Committee of Council). t Where Her Majesty by a charter extends the Municipal Corpora tion Acts to a municipal borough, it shall be lawful for Her Majesty, by the charter, to do all or any of the following things : (1) To fix the number of councillors, and to fix the number and boundaries of the wards (if any), and to assign the number of councillors to each ward; and (2) to fix the years, days, and times for the retirement of the first aldermen and councillors ; and (3) to fix such days, times, and places, and nominate such persons to perform such duties, and make such other temporary modifications of the Municipal Corpora tion Acts, as may appear to Her Majesty to be necessary or proper for making those Acts applicable in the case of the first constitution of a municipal borough. The years, days, times aud places fixed by the charter, and the persons nominated therein to perform any duties, shall, as regards the borough named in the charter, be respectively substituted in the Municipal Corporation Acts for the years, days, times, places, officers, and persons therein mentioned, and the persons so nominated shall have the like powers, and be subject to the like obligations and penalties, as the officers and persons mentioned in * Section 3. f Section 4. J Section 5."], [61, "43 THEIR GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT. the said Acts for whom they are respectively substituted. Subject to the provisions of the charter authorised by this section, the Municipal Corporation Acts shall, upon the charter coming into effect, apply to the municipal borough to which they are extended by the charter, in like manner as if it were a borough named in schedule B to the Municipal Corporation Act, 1835, and as if the date of the charter were substituted in the last-mentioned Act for the time of the passing of that Act and for the fifth day of June, one thousand eight hundred and thirty-five, and where the first mayor, aldermen, and councillors, or any of them are named in the charter, shall apply as if they were elected under the said Acts ; and where they are not so named, shall apply to their first election. * Where a petition for a charter is referred to the Committee of Council, and it is proposed by the charter to extend the Municipal Corporation Acts to the municipal borough to be created by the charter, the Committee of Council may settle a scheme for the adjustment ofthe powers, rights, privileges, franchises, duties, property, and liabilities of any then existing local authority whose district comprises the whole or part of the area, of that borough, either with or without an adjoining or other place, and also of any officer of that authority ; and where, within one month after the publication of the scheme in the London Gazette, a petition against the scheme by any local authority affected thereby, or by not less than one-twentieth of the owners and ratepayers of the borough (such twentieth to be one-twentieth in number of the owners and ratepayers of the borough taken together, or the owners and ratepayers in respect of one-twentieth of the rateable property in the borough) has been received by the Committee of Council, and is not withdrawn, the scheme shall require the confirmation of Parliament, and the Committee of Council may, if they think fit, submit it to Parliament for confirmation, but otherwise at any time after the expiration ofthe said month, or after the withdrawal of any petition that has been presented, the Committee of Council may, if they think fit, submit the scheme for confirmation, either to Parliament or to Her Majesty in Council, and in the latter case it shall be lawful for Her Majesty to confirm the scheme by Order in Council. (2.) The qualifications for the Franchise. \u2014 The principal clause in reference to this subject in 5 and 6 William IV., c. 76, is the ninth, as follows : \u2014 \" And be it enacted that every male person of full age who on the last day of August in any year shall have occupied any house, warehouse, counting-house, or * Section 6."], [62, "44 ENGLISH MUNICIPAL INSTITUTIONS ' shop within any borough during the year and the whole of each of the two pre ceding years, and also during the time of such occupation shall have been an inhabitant householder within the said borough or within seven miles of the said borough, shall, if duly enrolled in that year, according to the provisions herein after contained, be a burgess of such borough, and member of the body corporate of the mayor, aldermen, and burgesses of such borough : Provided always that no such person shall be so enrolled in any year unless he shall have been rated in respect of such premises so occupied -by him within the borough to all rates made for the relief of the poor of the parish wherein such premises are situated during the time of his occupation aforesaid, unless he shall have paid on or before the last day of August as aforesaid all such rates, including therein all borough rates, if any, directed to be paid under the provisions of this Act, as shall have become payable by him in respect of the said premises, except such as shall become payable within six calendar months next before the said last day of August : Provided also that the premises in respect of the occupation of which any person shall have been so rated need not be the same premises or in the same parish, but may be different premises in the same parish or in different parishes : Provided also that no person being an alien shall be so enrolled in any year, and that no person shall be so enrolled in any year who within twelve calendar months next before the said last day in August shall have received parochial relief or other alms, or any pension or charitable allowance from any fund entrusted to the charitable trustees of such borough hereinafter mentioned : Provided that in every case provided in this act the distance of seven miles shall be computed by the nearest public road or way by land or water.\" It will be observed that under this section a burgess must be an inhabitant as well as an occupying householder. The occupier of a shop, counting-house, or warehouse within the borough, is not entitled to be on the burgess roll, unless he holds a house within the borough, or within seven miles of it. The residence must be actual and bona fide ; mere colourable residence within the borough or -within seven miles will not make a person an inhabitant so as to entitle him to be on the burgess roll. He is not, however, the less a householder or the less an occupier of a house because he lets a portion of his house to lodgers. The retention of any part of the house as his own dwelling gives him the legal occupation of the whole ; the occupation of the lodger being considered in law that of the landlord, who is the party entitled to be rated. AVith regard to rating, it is now settled that, in order to constitute a good rating, the name of the party intended to be charged must appear on the rate. The payment of rates to entitle a person to be put upon the burgess list of a borough must be a payment by his own act. Pay ment by another person acting as a volunteer and without any authority from the person liable is not sufficient. But a payment by a landlord in consequence of an arrangement between him and his tenant, who was to pay an additional rent in respect thereof, is con-"], [63, "THEIR GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT 45 sidered a sufficient payment by the tenant. The non-payment of an illegal rate does not disqualify the ratepayer, although he has not appealed against it. Relief of any kind * \u2014 including medical relief given by the poor-law authorities to a man, or any member of his family whom by law he is bound to maintain, will disqualify him for admission to the burgess roll. Occupiers of any house, ware house, counting-house, or shop in any borough may claim to be rated to the relief of the poor in respect of such premises, whether the landlord is or is not liable to be rated in respect thereof ; and upon such occupier so claiming and actually paying or tendering the full amount of the last made rate then payable in respect of such premises, the overseer of the parish in which such premises are situate are required to put the name of the occupier upon the rate for the time being. [By the Act 21 and 22 Vic., c. 43, it was enacted that when the owner of a tenement, the ratable value of which does not exceed \u00a36, is rated to the poor instead ofthe occupier thereof, and such owner has paid all rates due in respect of such tenement, the occupier shall be entitled to all municipal privileges and franchises to which he would have been entitled if he himself had been rated and had paid his rates ; and if such owner has not paid his rates, then the occupier may tender to the overseers the amount of any rate or rates then due from the occupier in respect of such tenement, and such overseer is bound to receive the same ; and on payment or tender of such amount the occupier will be entitled to exercise all municipal privileges and franchises.] The Act 32 and 33 Victoria, c. 55, shortened the term of residence to one year and varied the period of qualification, in these words : \u2014 \" The ninth section of the Act of the session of the fifth and sixth years of King William the Fourth, chapter seventy-six, is repealed, and instead thereof it is enacted, that every person of full age who on the last day of Julys in any year shall have occupied any house, warehouse, counting-house, shop, or other building within any borough during the ivhole of the preceding twelve calendar months, and also during the time of such occupation shall have resided within the said borough, or within seven miles of the said borough, shall, if duly enrolled in that year according to the provisions contained in the said Act of the sessions of the fifth and sixth years of King William the Fourth, chapter seventy-six, and the Acts amending the same, be a burgess of such borough : Provided that no such person shall be so enrolled in any year unless he shall have been rated in respect of such premises so occupied by him within the * Medical or surgical assistance received from the charitable trustees of any borough, or instruction in the endowed schools, is not a cause of disqualification for burgess-ship. (5 & 6 Will. IV., c. 76, s. 10.) t Sec. 7 of 41 & 42 Viet., c. 26, names the loth day of Julv as the date to which the period of qualification is now to be computed for both paiii.unentary and munici pal voters."], [64, "46 ENGLISH MUNICIPAL INSTITUTIONS; borough to all rates made for the relief of the poor of the parish wherein such premises are situated during the time of his occupation as aforesaid, and unless he shall have paid on or before the twentieth day of July in such year all such rates, including therein all borough rates, if any, directed to be paid under the provisions of the said Acts, as shall have become payable by him in respect of the said premises up to the preceding fifth day of January : Provided also, that the premises in respect of the occupation of wliich any person shall have been so rated need not be the same premises or in the same parish, but may be different premises in the same parish or in different parishes : Provided also, that no person being an alien shall be enrolled in any year, and that no person shall be so enrolled in any year who, within twelve calendar months next before the said last day of July, shall have received parochial relief or other alms : Provided also, that the respective distances mentioned in this Act shall be measured in the manner directed by section seventy-six of the Act of the session of the sixth and seventh years of Queen Victoria, chapter eighteen.\" (3.) The Burgess Roll and its Preparation. \u2014 By 5 and 6 William IV., c. 76, the Overseers of the Poor in every parish, wholly or in part, within any borough, are on the fifth* day of September in every year, to make out an alphabetical list, called \" The Burgess List,\" of all persons entitled to be enrolled in the burgess roll of that year according to the provisions of the act in respect of property within such parish. The list, duly signed by the overseers, is to be delivered, on the said fifth* day of September, to the town clerk of the borough,f who is to allow a true copy thereof to be perused by any person, without payment of any fee, at all reasonable hours, between the fifth and fifteenth days of September in every year. The town clerk is also to cause copies to be forthwith printed of all overseers' lists delivered to him ; is to give a copy to any person requiring the same, on payment of a reasonable price ; and is also to cause a copy to be fixed on or near the outer door of the town hall, or in some public and conspicuous situation within the borough, on every day during the week next preceding the fifteenth of September in every year. Overseers neglecting to make out and sign the burgess lists are liable to a fine of \u00a350. Every person whose name has been omitted from any such burgess list, and who claims to have his name inserted therein, must on or before the fifteenth day of September in every year give notice to the town * The Jifth was the day named in this Act, but see page 48 as to 20 & 21 Viet., c. 50, s. 7, which altered the date to the first. t If there be no town clerk, or the town clerk be dead or otherwise incapable of acting, all things required by the Act to be done by and with regard to the town clerk are to be done by and with regard to the person executing duties in the borough similar to those of town clerks; and if there be no such person, or such person be dead or incapable of acting, then by and with regard to such fit person as the mayor of such borough shall appoint in that behalf. The reasonable expenses incurred by the overseers in preparing the lists are to be defrayed out of the borough fund."], [65, "THEIR GROAVTH AND DEA'ELOPMENT 47 clerk, in writing, according to the form given in a schedule to the act or to the hke effect ; and every person whose name has been inserted in the burgess list for any borough may object to any other person as not being entitled to have his name retained on the burgess list for the same borough. A person so objecting must on or before the fifteenth of September in every year give to the town clerk of such borough, and also give to the person objected to, or leave at the premises for which he shall appear to be rated in the burgess list, notice thereof in writing (according to the form given in the Act or to the like effect) . The town clerk is then to draw up lists of these claims and objections ; is to cause copies of them to be fixed on or near the outer door of the town hall, or in some public and con spicuous position in the borough, during the eight days next pre ceding the first of October in every year ; is to keep a copy of these lists to be perused by any person, without the payment of any fee, during the eight days (Sundays excepted) next preceding the first of October in every year, and is to deliver a copy of such lists to any person requiring the same on payment of a sum not exceeding one shilling. The lists prepared and published in the manner described are then to be revised* by the mayor and two assessors, annually chosen by tbe burgesses, who are for that purpose to hold an open court (three clear days' notice having been given) at some time between the first day of October inclusive and the fifteenth day of October inclusive. The burgess list having been revised is to be delivered to the town clerk, who is to keep the same, to cause the said list to be fairly and truly copied into one general alphabetical list in a book, with every name therein numbered,! beginning the numbers from the first name, and continuing them in a regular series to the last name ; is to cause such book to be completed on or before the twenty-second day of October in every year ; and every such book in which the said burgess list shall have been copied shall be the burgess roll of the burgesses of such borough entitled to vote in the choice of the councillors, assessors, and auditors of such borough at any election which may take place in such borough, between the first day of November inclusive in the year wherein such burgess roll shaU have been made and the first day of November in the succeeding year. Copies of the burgess rolls are to be printed for sale. By Sections 3, 5, 6, and 7, of 7 William IV., and 1 Victoria, c. 78, * But see next page as to the Act 41 & 42 Viet., o. 26. f When the borough is divided into wards, the burgess roll is to be made out by the town clerk in alphabetical lists of the burgesses in each ward."], [66, "48 ENGLISH MUNICIPAL INSTITUTIONS J (which statute was passed to settle some minor defects experienced in the working of the principal Act), when a borough is divided into wards, two assessors are to be chosen on the 1st of March in each year, or, if that be a Sunday, on the following day, to hold the court for revising the burgess lists with the mayor in like manner, as is provided by the Municipal Corporations Act, with respect to the election of two auditors for the borough. The burgess roll is not to be questioned for want of title to their offices on the part of mayor and assessors. One burgess roll is to be in force until the new burgess roll has been duly made ; and corporations are not to be dissolved by any neglect to make a new burgess roll. By Clause 24, the Court of Queen's Bench may grant a mandamus to put a burgess on the roll. By 20 and 21 Victoria, c. 50, s. 7, the day for preparing and delivering the burgess roll by the overseers was changed from the fifth to the first day of September. The Act 41 and 42 Victoria, c. 26, combines, in boroughs both parliamentary and municipal, the separate systems of registration and revision with respect to the parliamentary lists and burgess rolls. Tbe revising barristers, in such boroughs, are invested, so far as the burgess roUs are concerned, with the duties formerly dis charged by the mayor and the two assessors, the latter office being aboUshed. Boroughs, municipal but not parliamentary, are but slightly affected by this statute,which provides for the details attendant upon the assimilation, and will be found more fully abstracted under the succeeding section (the ParUamentary Franchise) , Unlike the Parliamentary Reform Act of 1832, the Municipal Reform Act of 1835 did not grant, continue, or reserve to the \" freemen \" the privilege of voting, by virtue of their freedom. The exclusion could not, in that light, be deemed a hardship because, as pointed out in Part IL, the greater portion of them had for generations been deprived of any share in municipal elections. Section 2, however, reserved all rights of property and beneficial exemptions to existing freemen and their wives and children ; Section 3 abolished the power of admitting freemen (or burgesses) by gift or purchase ; and Section 4 confirmed the reservation of the parliamentary franchise. All exclusive rights of trading were extin guished, as also were exemptions from local tolls on the part of any person not already possessed of such an immunity. The claims of freemen to the enjoyment of property or direct and indirect pecuniary profits in boroughs named in the schedules of the Municipal Reform Act are shown in the annexed table whicb is an"], [67, "THEIR GROAA'TH AND DEA'ELOPMENT 49 almost literal reproduction of a table compiled by the Assistant Secretary to the Commissioners.

The abolition of admissions to the freedom of a borough by gift or purchase has exhausted all shares to the \"rights of property\" in some of the foregoing places ; in a few the \" rights \" have been compounded for by the governing body ; and in others the various interests still remain in force, although, generally speaking, they are of trifling value. Tables 3 and 4 of this section have been compiled, so far as they relate to the corporate existence and government previous to 1835, from several authorities \u2014 principally, the Municipal Inquiry and Boundary Commissioners' Reports, Merewether and Stephens' History of Boroughs, County Histories, and contemporary Parliamentary Papers. The number of burgesses for the present year (with the particulars respecting Colchester, Saffron Walden, Sudbury, and Great Yarmouth \u2014 places not reported upon by the Municipal Commissioners) have been procured by direct application to the executive officials of each city or borough.

The Parliamentary and Municipal Franchises, although distinct in every sense, have, for the last five hundred years, been so closely and peculiarly associated as to forbid the significant influences of the paramount privilege being overlooked in a work of this character. The gradual depreciation of the social and older franchise and its general subservience (until the year 1835) to the powerful domina tion of the national and younger franchise has been already traced in Part II. The British Constitution, in its present form, is not comprised or defined in any one document. Its principles combine a variety of unwritten customs, supplemented by the provisions of several Royal"], [82, "64 ENGLISH MUNICIPAL INSTITUTIONS ; charters and grants, formal deeds, and Acts of Parliament. The chief documents are : \u2014 1. Charta libertatum, (Henry I). 2. Magna Charta, (John). 3. Petition of Rights, (Charles I). 4. Habeas Corpus, (Charles II). 5. Declaration of Rights, (William III). 6. Act of Succession, 1701, (William III). 7. Act of Succession, 1705, (Anne). 8. Act of Union with Scotland, 1707, (Anne). 9. Act of Union with Ireland, 1801, (George III). 10. Reform Act, (England and Wales) 1832, (William IV) 11. Reform Act, (England and Wales) 1867, (Victoria). 12. Reform Act, (Scotland) 1868, (Victoria). Whatever may have been the true constitution of the Saxon witena-gemot (or council of bishops and nobles) and mickel-gemot, (or general council) which are often spoken of as the fundamental basis of the British Parliament, it was not until Simon de Montfort (temp. 1265) summoned the barons of his own party, several eccle siastics who were not immediate tenants of the Crown, two knights from each shire, and deputies from the cities and boroughs in a common assembly, for the purpose of securing popular support in his opposition to Henry III., that the right of the people to a share in the direction of the affairs of the kingdom, received a certain recognition by the governing estates of the realm. In these elections, household suffrage may be said to have prevailed ; but the alleged frequency of tumults subsequently led (temp. Henry VI.) to the voting power being restricted to certain qualified persons. The diversified outgrowth of the circumscribed franchise will be best understood by a reference to Col. 4 of Table 2 in this section. The perpetuation of the ancient rights therein shewn, under the present system of parliamentary voting, may be described as advantageous in so far as they afford facilities for enabling individuals who, through purely personal circumstances, lose one qualification to obtain another. Tbe boroughs have at all times enjoyed a preponderance in the number of members of the House of Commons. In the first Par liament of the reign of Henry VIII. the whole number of the House was 298, the boroughs contributing a little more than thfee fifths of the representatives. With the last Act of Union (1801) the total strength of the House was brought up to 658 members, the"], [83, "THEIR GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT. 65 same as that of the present House.* The English and Welsh borough representation at the time of the Reform Act of 1832 was distributed thus : \u2014 ( 23 with 2 each -i 45 t fl with 4 J 4 r 165 with 2 each -j 330 X tl with 4 > 4 v 5 with 1 each ' 5 ( 10 with 1 each \\ 10 t 1 with 2 J 2 England \u2014 24 Cities 171 Boroughs Wales \u2014 11 Boroughs. 401 In the House as established under the Act of 1832 the borough seats were apportioned thus : \u2014 f fl city with 4 ... \"j 4 England ,* 133 cities and boroughs with 2 each > 266 C 53 cities and boroughs with 1 each ) 53 Wales ... 14 borough districts with 1 each .. . 14 337 In the present House the members for the English and Welsh cities and boroughs are as follows : \u2014 1 city with 4 ... ... ...] 4 1 city with 3 ... ... ... 3 England J. 3 boroughs with 3 each ... ... \\- 9 \u00a789 cities and boroughs with 2 each \u00a7178 92 cities and boroughs with 1 each J 92 ( 1 borough district with 2 . . . ) 2 Wales | 13 borough districts with 1 each ... j 13 \u00a7301 The combined representation of the Enghsh counties and univer sities, the Scotch counties, universities, cities, and burghs, and the Irish counties, university, cities, and boroughs is, therefore, seen to be only 56 members in excess of the English borough representation. * Practically the House has numbered for some years only 652 members\u2014 the consequence of the disfranchisement of the boroughs of Beverley and Bridgwater (England), and Cashel and Sligo (Ireland), which occurred subsequent to the passing of the Beform Acts of 1867 and 1868 ; the Government have, however (April 1879), announced their intention to take steps for filling up these vacancies. t London.

Wales 1 member to every 40,571 inhabitants. Scotland 1 member to every 56,000 inhabitants. Ireland 1 member to every 51,156 inhabitants. United Kingdom, 1 member to every 55,464 inhabitants. The present proportionate representation of the parliamentary and municipal boroughs of England and Wales will be found at page 88. The Act, 2 William IV. c. 45, better known as the Parliamentary Reform Act of 1832, struck the first blow at that flagrant perversion of municipal privileges which had been so general throughout the country for a period of four hundred years, by breaking down the political ascendancies of certain parties and families. By the changes it effected fifty-six decayed (or \" rotten \") boroughs were wholly deprived of the franchise ; thirty boroughs had their representatives reduced to one member each, and that of one (Weymouth and Melcombe Regis) was reduced to two members ; \u2014 twenty-two boroughs to return two members each, and nineteen to return one each, were created in England. The old qualifications for the franchise were all preserved with restrictions as to residence, date of admissions to freedom, &c, and the right of voting conferred on every male person of full age, not subject to any legal incapacity, who occupied in a city or borough, as owner or tenant, any house, warehouse, counting house, shop, or other building of the clear annual value of not less than \u00a310, provided such person should have paid the poor rates and assessed taxes, have occupied for twelve months next previous to the last* day of July, in the year in which registration is sought, and have resided for six months next previous to the last* day of July, in the city or borough, or within seven miles thereof. A comparison of Cols. 5 and 7 of Tables 2 and 4 in this section will shew the extent to which the voting power ofthe cities and boroughs was increased under the Act. The boundaries of the cities and boroughs were newly defined and settled by a supplemental Act of Parliament (2 & 3 Will. IV. c. 64). The Act 30 & 31 Victoria, c. 102, determined the English and Welsh borough franchise in its present form. By it four boroughs were totally disfranchised (for bribery and corruption) ; the repre sentation of thirty-eight cities and boroughs was reduced from two members to one member each ; \u2014 that of one city and three boroughs * Sec. 7 of 41 and 42 Viet. c. 26 enacts that in every parliamentary borough and in every municipal borough every period of qualification for parliamentary voters and burgesses respectively which is now computed by reference to the last day of July shall, instead, be computed to the 15th day of July."], [85, "67 THEIR GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT. was increased from two members to three members each ; and that of two boroughs from one member to two members each. Eleven new borouo-hs were created, two to return two members each, and nine to return one member each.* As in the case of the Act of 1832, the Act of 1867 was followed by a supplemental Act (31 and 32 Viet. c. 46) which newly defined the several boundaries. The annexed table will illustrate the extent of the various ancient right qualifications in the year preceding the passing of the Act (so far as relates to cities and boroughs under the Municipal Act of 1835). These peculiar qualifications are being gradually extinguished by the expanded franchise, and in some of the cities and boroughs named have altogether lapsed. TABLE 1.

The person must have been rated as an ordinary occupier to all Poor Rates made during such twelve months, and on or before July 20 must have paid all Poor Rates payable in respect of the premises up to the preceding January 5. Joint occupation of a dwelling-house does not give a qualification under this enactment. The payment of rates by an owner instead of by an occupier is constructively a payment by the latter, so far that a claim to be rated is not now necessary ; (a) where the overseers have entered into a written agreement to collect the rates from the owner instead of from the occupier ; (b) where the local authority has made an order that owners should be rated instead of occupiers. In all other cases where a person is omitted from the Rate Book he must make a formal claim to be rated. (2) Ten Pound Occupier \u2014 Occupation for twelve calendar months preceding July 15* as owner or tenant of any house, warehouse, counting-house, shop, or other building, which, either separately or jointly with any land within the borough occupied therewith as owner or tenant under the same landlord, is of the clear yearly value of not less than \u00a310. (Occupation may be successive, but must be continuous.) The occupier must have resided in the borough, or within seven miles of its boundary, for six calendar months next preceding July 15.* All poor rates must be paid as stated for householders ; likewise assessed taxes due on the preceding January 5. Joint occupation qualifies when the aggregate value, if divided, gives an amount of not less than \u00a310 for each occupier. (3) Lodger \u2014 Occupation as a resident lodger, separately and as sole tenant for twelve months preceding July 15,* such lodgings being of the clear yearly value of not less than \u00a310, when let unfurnished. (The occupation may be successive if continuous and in the same house ; there may also be joint occupation with identical provisoes to the \u00a310 occupation, t) The franchise must be claimed every year by a claim being addressed to the Overseers between August 1 and 25 in the first year, and by the 25th of July in each succeeding year.J (4) Freeholder. \u2014 A footnote at page 69, and the sections of the statute quoted at page 71, explain this qualification.

And be it enacted, that no person shall be entitled to vote in the election of a member or members to serve in any future Parliament for any city or borough, save and except in respect of some right conferred by this Act, or as a burgess or freeman, or as a freeman and liveryman, or, in the case of a city or town being a county of itself, as a freeholder or burgage tenant, as hereinbefore mentioned : Provided always, that every person now having a right to vote in the election for any city or borough (except those enumerated in the said schedule (A.) in virtue of any other qualification than as a burgess or freeman, or as a freeman and liveryman, or, in the case of a city or town being a county of itself, as a freeholder or burgage tenant, as hereinbefore mentioned, shall retain such right of voting so long as he shall be qualified as an elector according to the usages and customs of such city or borough or any law now in force, and such person shall be entitled to vote in the election of a member or members to serve in any future Parliament for such city or borough, if duly registered according to the provisions hereinafter contained ; but that no such person shall * See footnote at page 66."], [90, "72 ENGLISH MUNICIPAL INSTITUTIONS ; be so registered in any year unless he shall, on the last* day of July in such year, be qualified as such elector, in such manner as would entitle him then to vote if such day were the day of election and this Act had not been passed, nor unless such person, where his qualification shall be in any city or borough, shall have resided for six calendar months next previous to the last* day of July in such year within such city or borough, or within seven statute miles from the place where the poll for such city or borough shall heretofore have been taken, nor unless such person, where his qualification shall be within any place sharing in the election for any city or borough, shall have resided for six calendar months next previous to the last* day of July in such year within such respective place so sharing as aforesaid, or within seven statute miles of the place mentioned in conjunction with such respective place so sharing as aforesaid, and named in the second column of the schedule marked (E. 2) to this Act annexed : Provided, nevertheless, that every such person shall for ever cease to enjoy such right of voting for any such city or borough as aforesaid if his name shall have been omitted for two successive years from the register of such voters for such city or borough hereinafter directed to be made, unless he shall have been so omitted in consequence of his having received parochial relief within twelve calendar months next previous to the last* day of July in any year, or in consequence of his absence on the naval or military service of His Majesty.\" (2) Procedure for Registration. \u2014 On or before July 20th, poor rates due on the previous January 5 must be paid by inhabitant householders, and poor rates and assessed taxes similarly due must be paid by \u00a310 occupiers. On the lst day of August town clerks must publish lists of inhabitant householders, of \u00a310 occupiers, and of reserved rights of voting (if any). All notices of objection must be posted, so that in the ordinary course of post they shall reach the persons to whom they are addressed not later than the 25th of August. Also, not later than this day persons whose names have been omitted from the lists must send in their claims. Lodgers claiming for the first time must do so between the lst and 25th of August ; afterwards their claims for continuance on the register should be made by the 25th of July.f Lists of persons claiming, and of persons objected to, are to be published by town clerks and overseers on the lst day of September. The names of lodgers are to be made into a separate list. Between September 15 and October 31, both inclusive, the Revising Barrister must hold courts, of which seven days' notice is to be given to the town clerk, who in turn will advertise the fixtures by notice on the town hall, and on every church, chapel, or meeting-house. With respect to the revision which, by 41 and 42 Victoria, c. 26, in Cities and Boroughs, both parliamentary and municipal, is combined for the parliamentary register and the burgess roll, sections 15 to 23 of the Act may be here usefully abstracted : \u2014 \" S. 15.

Where no part of the parish is situate within the municipal borough, the list for the parish shall be deemed to be a list of voters for the parliamentary borough : (6.) Where no part of the parish is situate within the parliamentary borough, the list for the parish shall be deemed to be a burgess list for the municipal borough : (7.) Where the list is made out in divisions, Divisions One and Two shall be deemed to be list of voters for the parliamentary borough, and Divisions One and Three shall be deemed to be burgess lists for the municipal borough : (8.) The lists, and, if the lists are made out in divisions, each division thereof shall, if and so far as the local authority from time to time direct, according to convenience for use, be framed in parts for polling districts or wards ; and where the polling districts and wards are not conterminous, in such manner that the parts may be con veniently compiled or put together to serve either as lists for polling districts or as ward lists.

S. 17. In the case of a parliamentary borough which includes in whole or in part more municipal boroughs than one, each such municipal borough shall, for the purposes of this Act, be dealt with separately, and as if each were the only municipal borough included in whole or in part in such parliamentary borough ; and if any parish is partly in one and partly in another or others of such"], [92, "74 ENGLISH MUNICIPAL INSTITUTIONS; municipal boroughs, so much thereof as is in any one of such municipal boroughs shall, for the purposes of this Act, be dealt with as a separate parish.

If and so far as the local authority so direct, the lists of parliamentary voters and registers of parliamentary voters in parliamentary boroughs, and the burgess lists and burgess rolls in municipal boroughs, and the lists of claimants and persons objected to in parliamentary boroughs and municipal boroughs respectively, or any of those documents, shall, so far as they relate to persons qualified in respect of the ownership or occupation of property (including persons qualified in respect of lodgings), be arranged in the same order in which the qualifying premises appear in the rate book for the parish in which those premises are situate, or as nearly thereto as will cause those lists, registers, and rolls to record the qualifying premises in successive order in the street or other place in which they are situate, subject in the case of a municipal borough divided into wards to the division of the burgess roll into ward lists. The local authority in this Act means as regards a parliamentary borough the authority having power to divide the parliamentary borough into polling districts, and as regards a municipal borough the council of the municipal borough. S. 22. Where a person is entered in respect of lodgings on the register of voters for the time being in force, and desires to be entered on the next register in respect of the same lodgings, he may claim to be so entered by sending notice of his claim to the overseers of the parish in which his lodgings are situate on or before the 25th July. The overseers shall on or before the last day of July make out a list of all persons so claiming, and if they have reasonable"], [93, "THEIR GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT. 75 cause to believe that any person whose name is entered on the list is not entitled to be registered or is dead, shall add in the margin of the list opposite his name tho words \" objected to \" or \" dead \" as the case may be. The lists so made out shall be signed, published, and otherwise dealt with in the same manner as the alphabetical lists mentioned in s. 13 of the Parliamentary Registration Act, 1843, and shall for the purposes of the Parliamentary Registration Acts be deemed to be lists of voters, and the provisions of the Parliamentary Registration Acts as to objections shall apply to such lists, and the persons against whose names the overseers have so written the words \"objected to\" or \"dead\" shall be deemed to be duly objected to. S. 23. In the case of a person claiming to vote as a lodger, the declaration annexed to his notice of claim shall, for the purposes of revision, be prima facie evidence of his qualification.\" The new register, revised as above, comes into operation on the 1st of January following; the burgess roll on the 1st of November following. Both remain in force for ooe year. (3) Procedure in Elections. \u2014 The appended extract from a Parlia mentary paper, issued in 1872, best describes the course of proceedings in connection with a borough election. (Say) July 1. Receipt of writ. ,, 2. Last possible day for notice. \u201e 4. First possible day for nomination. \u201e 5. Last possible day for nomination. ,, 6. First possible day for poll in ordinary boroughs. \u201e 7. First possible day for poll in district boroughs. ,, 9. Last possible day for poll in ordinary boroughs. \u201e 12. Last possible day for poll in district boroughs. The Act 35 and 36 Victoria, c. 33, prescribes that the voting shall be by ballot. The returning officer in a city or borough is the Mayor, unless the city or borough be a county of itself, in which case the duties devolve upon the Sheriff. The classes of persons ineligible to sit in the House of Commons comprise \u2014 aliens ; minors ; English and Scotch peers (Irish peers may sit for English constituencies) ; clergymen of the Church of England ; bankrupts ; felons during the term of their sentence ; judges ; London police magistrates ; revising barristers and returning officers, so far as relates to the constituency to which they are attached ; holders of certain offices specified by statute ; and con tractors with Government. Candidates at Parliamentary elections found guilty of bribery are disqualified for the term of seven years from the date of being so reported to the House. The Tables in this section have been compiled from the particulars contained in a large number of Parliamentary Reports and Returns extending from the year 1830 to 1879. The more recent information has been secured by direct application to the chief officials of each city and borough."], [94, "ce TABLE 2. \u2014 (Part IV, Sec 4.) \u2014 Municipal Cities and Boroughs named in Schedules A and B or 5 & 6 William IV., c 76, which are also Parliamentary Boroughs.

(5.) The Governing Body. The Tables of this Section, combined with those of Section 3, will, of themselves, shew the extremely small share which the real com- munity of each city and borough had in the election of the governing body previous to 1835. The general character of the Councils, their"], [107, "their growth and development. 89 exclusive and party spirit, and the extent to which they were vitiated by the defects of their organization, have already been referred to. The Municipal Commissioners passed a scathing condemnation upon them in the following terms : \u2014 \" So far from being the representa tives, either of the population or the property of the town, they do not represent even the privileged class of the freemen ; and being elected for life, their proceedings are unchecked by any feeling of responsibility. The discharge of the functions with which they are entrusted is rendered difficult by the dislike and suspicion which their manner of election entails upon them.\" The ancient Councils were, in most places, composed of two classes, \" aldermen \" and \" councilmen.\" In a few corporations the alder men had distinct powers, and met separately, from the \" councilmen,\" as in London ; in others, the distinction was merely honorary. Some of the corporations possessed more than two classes in the Council, and in several certain officers became permanent members of the Council by virtue of their office. The subjoined extract from the Commissioners' Report succinctly describes the prevailing method of election : \u2014 \" There are very few instances in the corporations of indefinite number, in which, as at Berwick-upon-Tweed and Ipswich, the general body of the freemen have the power of choosing whomsoever they please of themselves as the head of the corporation. Sometimes he is chosen by the freemen from the aldermen, or from the members of the Common Council. In some boroughs he is chosen by the body at large from among two or more nominated by the select body. The most common case is, that he is selected either from the aldermen or common councilmen by the Court of Aldermen or Common Council. In London, and some other towns, he is elected by a popular assembly from the aldermen. * * In some places he is presented by the Jurors of the Court leet. In several boroughs the same person is re-eligible only after a given interval. In all cases the election is for a year. The members of the Common Council are elected, in the great majority of instances, by the Common Council, or that division of it commonly comprised under the name of aldermen. In some cases they are nominated by the mayor. The election is generally for life. Residence is some times a necessary qualification ; often it is little attended to. The aldermen generally fill up vacancies in their own body, from the other division of the Common Council ; in other cases this class consists of aU who have passed the chair. The aldermen also are usually chosen into that class for life. London and Norwich afford instances, among others, of elections by large bodies of free men. In both these cities the aldermen are elected for life, and the common councilmen annually. * * In Norwich all are elected by the freemen without any qualification of residence, property, or local taxation.\" The regulations as to the election of mayor, aldermen, and coun cillors, and the procedure at meetings of the Council, enacted by 5 & 6 William IV., c. 76, will be best subdivided under the follow-"], [108, "90 ENGLISH MUNICIPAL INSTITUTIONS \\ ing heads : \u2014 (1) Election of Councillors. [Under this head several clauses, which apply alike to the mayor, aldermen, and officers, are of necessity introduced] ; (2) Election of Aldermen ; (3) Election of Mayor ; (4) The Council ; its Meetings ; and its Officers. Subse quent statutes amending the above Act in minor points are quoted at the foot of each page, or in order of sequence; but those effecting important alterations are stated chronologically. (1) Election of Councillors. \u2014 All persons on the burgess roll, and none others, are entitled to vote in the election of town councillors, which is to take place on the first of November in every year, unless that day happens to fall on a Sunday. One third of the council go out of office each year, so that the term of office for each councillor is three years. When a borough is not divided into wards, the election of councillors is to be held before the mayor and the assessors* of the borough, but when the borough is divided into wards, then before the alderman of the ward and the two assessors of the ward. The voting at every such election is to commence at nine o'clock in the forenoon, and is finally to close at four o'clock in the afternoon of the same day, but the poll may be closed at any time before four o'clock if one hour shall have elapsed without a vote having been tendered.! The provisions of this Act with respect to the mode of taking the poll are now superseded by those of the Ballot Act, and of the Act 38 & 39 Viet. c. 40 (which see at page 100.) No inquiry can be made of any burgess tendering his vote except as follows : that the mayor or other officer presiding at the election must, if required by any two bur gesses entitled to vote, put to the voter at the time qf his delivering in his voting paper, and not after, the following questions or any of them, and no other : 1. Are you the person whose name is signed as A.B. to the voting paper now delivered in by you ? 2. Are you the person whose name appears as A.B. on the burgess roll now in force for this borough, being registered therein as rated for property described to be situated in ? (specifying the street, ecc, as described on the burgess roll) . 3. Have you already voted at the present election ? No person who is required to answer any of the said questions is to be permitted to vote until he has answered them, and any person who gives a false answer commits a misdemeanour, and may be indicted and punished accordingly. It is perhaps worth while observing that the strict prohibition in the Act against putting any See 41 & 42 Viet. c. 26, s. 20 (page 74).- f ' Will. IV. and 1 Viet. c. 78, s. 18."], [109, "THEIR GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT. 91 but the three questions we have given above prevents any inquiry into a voter's change or loss of qualification. Once on the buro-ess roll a person is entitled to vote during the year in which that roll is in force, whether he does or does not possess the same or any qualification. The voting being over, the mayor and assessors, or, if the borough be divided into wards, the presiding alderman and assessors, are to examine the voting papers in order to see who has been elected. In case of any equality of votes for two or more persons, the returning officer (mayor or alderman) and assessors, or any two of them, are to give a casting vote or votes. A list of the persons elected is to be published not later than two o'clock p.m.* on the following day, unless it happens to be Sunday, and then on Monday. Where the majority of electors vote for a disqualified person in ignorance of the fact of disqualification, the election may be void or voidable, or, in the latter case, may be capable of being made good, according to the nature of the disqualification. The objection may require ulterior proceedings to be taken before some competent tribunal in order to be made available, or it may be such as to place the elected candidate on the same footing as if he had never existed, and the votes for him were a nullity ; but in no such case are the electors who vote for him deprived of their votes, if the fact becomes known and is declared while the election is still incomplete; they may then instantly proceed to vote for another candidate. If it be disclosed afterwards, the party elected may be ousted and the election declared void, but the candidate in the minority will not be deemed ipso facto elected. But when an elector before voting receives due notice that a particular candidate is disqualified, and yet will do nothing but tender his vote for him, he must be taken as voluntarily abstaining from exercising his franchise, and as violating his duty of assisting at the election.! We have hitherto said nothing on the subject of the wards into which most boroughs are divided, or on the manner in which the election of councillors is conducted in that case. It now becomes necessary that we should touch briefly on both points. Under the Act of 1835 it was directed that certain large boroughs should be divided into wards, and barristers were appointed to perform the work, it being provided \" that the number of councillors assigned to each ward shall be a number divisible by three.\" It was then enacted that a third of the councillors for each * No publication can be made after two o'clock under any circumstances. It would, if actually made, be a mere nullity. f Grant on Corporations, page 399.."], [110, "92 ENGLISH MUNICIPAL INSTITUTIONS \\ ward \u2014 one or more according to the number assigned to the ward \u2014 should go out of office on each first of November, so that each councillor would serve three years. The election of councillors in each ward is to be before the aldermen whom the councillors chosen to each ward shall yearly appoint on that behalf, and before the two assessors of each ward ;* the aldermen and assessors having the same power as the mayor and assessors would have had if the borough had not been divided into wards. Burgesses are to vote in the election of councillors and assessors for the ward in which the pro perty for which they are rated is situated, and if any burgess is rated in respect of distinct premises in two or more wards, then he is to be entitled to be enrolled in such one of the said wards as he shall select, but not in more than one. If, at any election of councillors or assessors for any borough, any person is elected a councillor or assessor for more than one ward, he must, within three days' notice thereof, choose, or in default of his choice, the mayor must declare for, which ward he is to serve; and is held to have been elected in that ward only which he so chooses, or which the mayor so declares.! If any extraordinary vacancy (that is a vacancy occasioned by any other cause than the expiration of the time of service) occurs in the office of councillor, auditor, or assessor for any borough, the burgesses entitled to vote are, on a day to be fixed by the mayor of the borough, or in the case of a councillor or assessor, when the borough has been divided into wards, by the alderman of the ward in which the vacancy has happened (such day to be not later than ten days after notice shall have been given to the mayor or town clerk by any two burgesses,)! elect from the persons qualified to be councillors another burgess to supply such vacancy, and every person thus elected will hold office until the person in room of whom he was chosen would regularly have gone out of office. It has been held that an election taken to fill ordinary and extraordinary vacancies both together is wholly bad. In case, therefore, an election to supply an extraordinary vacancy takes place on the day of an ordinary election (that is, on the first of November), care must be taken that in the notice of the election, as * By the Act, when a borough is divided into wards, two ward assessors are to be chosen annually by the burgesses of each ward ; but see also 4 1 and 42 Viet., c. 26, s. 20 (page 74), as to the abolition of the office of assessor in cities and boroughs which are both Parliamentary and Municipal. ! See also 34 and 35 Viet., c. 67 (at page 98). J Provided by 16 and 17 Viet., c. 79, s. 11. If through neglect or otherwise the vacancy has not been filled up within the time fixed the High Court of Justice (formerly Court of Queen's Bench) can, in accordance with the provisions of 7 William IV. and 1 Viet., c. 78, s. 26, grant a mandamus for the election."], [111, "THEIR GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT. 93 well as in all other subsequent proceedings, a distinction is preserved between the two classes of candidates and the two descriptions of vacancies, so that it may distinctly appear who is to fill the extra ordinary vacancy, and who the ordinary. With respect to the qualifications requisite (both for aldermen and councillors) it is provided that \u2014 \" No person being in holy orders or being the regular minister of any dissenting congregation shall be qualified to be elected, or be a councillor of any such borough, or an alderman of any such borouo-h ; nor shall any person be qualified to be elected, or to be a councillor, or alderman of any such borough who shall not be entitled to be on the burgess list of such borough, nor unless he shall be seised or possessed of real or personal estate or both to the followingXamount, that is to say, in all boroughs directed by this Act to be divided into four or more wards to the amount of \u00a31,000, or be rated to the relief of the poor of such borough upon the annual value of not less than \u00a330, and in all boroughs directed to be divided into less than four wards, or which shall not be divided into wards, to the amount of \u00a3500, or be rated to the relief of the poor in such boroughs upon the annual value of not less than \u00a315, or during such time as he shall hold any office or place of profit other than that of mayor, in the gift or disposal of the council of such borough, or during such time as he shall have directly or indirectly by himself or his partner, any share or interest in any contract or employment with, by, or on behalf of such council : Provided that no person shall be disqualified from being a councillor or alderman of any borough as aforesaid by reason of his being a proprietor or shareholder of any company which shall contract with the council of such borough for lighting or supplying with water or insuring against fire any part of such borough.\" No burgess can be elected a member of the council while holding the office of assessor or auditor. An un certificated bankrupt is not disqualified from being elected a councillor, though a person on being declared bankrupt while holding the office of a councillor is disqualified to retain, and immediately ceases to hold, the office. Not only are the holders of corporate offices disqualified, under the section we have just quoted, from election to the council, but also the holders of places of profit in the gift of the council. Thus, the town clerk, the treasurer, the registrar of a local court are all disqualified. The clerk to the justices, holding neither a corporate office nor a place of profit under the council, may be elected a councillor; but, if he be, the justices must immediately discharge"], [112, "94 ENGLISH MUNICIPAL INSTITUTIONS; him, since the 102nd section of the Act provides that it shall not be lawful for the justices to appoint or continue as their clerk any alderman or councillor of the borough. Under the word \" contract,\" in the latter part of the section we have just set out, it was held that not only did dealings between a corporation and a private individual for the supply of goods or commodities disqualify him for the office of a councillor, but that the same effect was produced by other transactions to which the legislature did not intend to attach this consequence. It was accordingly enacted by the 5th and 6th Yict. c. 104, \" that the word \u2022* contract ' shall not extend or be construed to extend to any lease, sale or purchase of any lands, tenements, or hereditaments ; or to any agreement for any such lease, sale, or purchase ; or for the loan of money ; or for any security for the payment of money only.\" Also, by the 15th Viet. c. 5, proprietors of newspapers in which are inserted advertisements relating to the affairs of the corporation are not to be thereby deemed to have an interest in a contract or employment within this section, and are exempted from disqualification on that account. The provisions of the Municipal Corporations Act of 1835 as to the declarations to be made by Mayors, Aldermen, and Councillors, have been superseded by those of the Promissory Oaths Act (31 & 32 Viet. c. 72.) Every person who, being duly qualified, is elected to the office of alderman, councillor, auditor or assessor, and every councillor who is elected to the office of mayor for any borough, must accept the office to which he has been elected, or must pay to the mayor, aldermen, and burgesses of such borough, such fine not exceeding \u00a350 in case of aldermen, councillors, auditors, and assessors, and such fine not exceeding \u00a3100, in case of a mayor, as the council shall by bye-law declare to be payable. The fine, if not duly paid, is to be levied by warrant of a justice, issued at the application of the council, upon the goods and chattels of the defaulter. The acceptance of office under this part of the Act is the making and subscribing of the declaration before referred to (that contained in the Municipal Corporations Act) within five days after notice of election. If a person duly elected fail to do this, he will be liable to pay the fine, and the office will be deemed vacant, and will be filled up by a fresh election. It is, however, provided that no person disabled by lunacy or imbecility of mind, by deafness, blindness, or other permanent infirmity of body, shall be liable to a fine ; that every person who is above sixty-five years old when elected, or who has already served the municipal offices in question, or paid the fine for non-acceptance,"], [113, "THEIR GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT. 95 shall be exempted from accepting or serving any of them if he claim his exemption within five days after receiving notice of his election ; and that nothing in the Act shall have the effect of compelling the acceptance of any office or duty whatever in any borough by any military, naval, or marine officer in His Majesty's service on full pay, or by any officer or other person employed and residing within any of His Majesty's dockyards, victualling establishments, arsenals, or barracks. If any person holding the office of mayor, alderman, or councillor for any borough is declared bankrupt, or compounds by deed with his creditors,* or being mayor is absent from the borough for more than two calendar months, or being an alderman or councillor for more than six months, at one and the same time (unless in case of illness), such person immediately becomes disqualified and ceases to hold the office (being liable in case of absence to the same fine as if he had refused to accept office), which the council are forthwith to declare void, by notice in writing under the hands of three or more of them, countersigned by the town clerk, to be affixed in some public place within the borough. The cause of disqualification, however, having been removed \u2014 by the grant of a certificate to the bankrupt, &c., or by return to the borough, the person thus removed from office may, if otherwise qualified, be re-elected. The mode herein pointed out for giving the notice must be strictly pursued ; the office is not void until the vacancy is duly declared. Every councillor is prohibited from being interested or concerned or being employed directly or indirectly as an architect, builder, artist, mechanic, workman, trader, merchant, or otherwise, in any part of the work to be done or materials to be supplied in building a borough gaol or house of correction, or in any contract relating thereto ; and anyone while in office, on becoming interested, concerned, or employed in such work or contract, shall thenceforward be disqualified from continuing to hold such office, and also from being thereafter elected or appointed to fill any corporate office within the borough.! It only remains to add in connection with the revision of the burgess list, and the election of councillors, assessors, &c, that if any mayor, alderman, or assessor neglects or refuses to perform any duty imposed upon him by law, in respect either of such revision or * See also 32 & 33 Viet., c. 63 (at page 98). ! The Act 40 & 41 Viet., c. 21 (Prisons Act) would seem to have rendered this provision nugatory, all prisons being now the property of the Government, and practi cally separated from the local control formerly exercised."], [114, "96 ENGLISH MUNICIPAL INSTITUTIONS ; such election, he is liable to a fine of \u00a3100. We have already seen that the overseers and the town clerk are liable to a penalty of \u00a350 for similar neglect or refusal in reference to the preparation of the burgess lists. These penalties are recoverable, with full costs of suit, by any person who chooses to sue for the same, within three calendar months after the commission of such offence, in any of the superior courts. Half the money recovered is, after payment of the costs and expenses of its recovery, to be paid to the person suing for it, while the other half is to go to the borough fund. The Act 7 William IV. and 1 Victoria, c. 78, enacts, among its miscellaneous provisions, that : \u2014 S. 1. No election of any person into any corporate office shall be questioned for want of title in the pre siding officer, provided such officer is in actual possession of, or acting in, the office, giving the right to preside at such election. S. 18. At any election under the provisions of the Municipal Corporations Act, or of this Act, it shall be lawful for the presiding officer to close the poll at any time before four o'clock if one hour shall have elapsed during which no vote has been tendered for any candidate ; provided, however, that no person or persons have, within the last hour, been prevented from coming to the poll by any riot, violence, or other un lawful means, of which notice shall have been given to the returning officer. S. 23. Every application to the Court of Queen's Bench for the purpose of calling upon any person to show by what warrant he claims to exercise the office of mayor, alderman, councillor, burgess in any borough, must be made before the end of twelve calendar months after the election, or the time when the person against whom such application shall be directed shall have become disqualified, and not at any subsequent time. S. 25. In case the elections of the mayor, or any of the aldermen, councillors, or other corporate officers, are not made upon the day or within the time appointed by the Municipal Corporations Act, or this Act, such elections may be made on the following day. S. 26. When no election, or no valid election of any corporate officer is made, or when the election after wards, by default or accident, becomes void, the Court of Queen's Bench is empowered to issue a mandamus for such election. The Act 6 & 7 Victoria, c. 104, enacts, inter alia, that members of the council shall not take part in any discussion in the issue of which they or their partners have directly or indirectly a pecuniary interest ; that no councillor, alderman, or mayor shall be disqualified for sitting and acting by reason of his being interested in any lease under the corporation ; and that the office of borough sheriff shall not be"], [115, "THEIR GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT. 97 deemed one of profit so as to disqualify the holder for a seat in the council. The Act 16 & 17 Victoria, c. 79, provides, inter alia, that vacancies in the offices of councillors, &c, are to be filled up within ten days after notice given thereof, by two burgesses, to the mayor or town clerk. The Act 22 Victoria, c. 35, is one of some importance with refer- ence to the regulation of municipal elections. Its importance has, however, been materially diminished by the repeal of the clauses relating to the municipal nomination and the substitution of other provisions by the 38 & 39 Viet., c. 40 (which see at page 100.) Sec- tion 9 provides that any person personating* or inducing another to personate a voter at a municipal election, or wilfully giving a false answer to the questions which are authorised to be put to him at the time of polling, shall be liable, on conviction before the justices iD petty sessions, to three months' imprisonment. Section 10 imposes the same punishment upon any one fabricating in whole or in part, alter- ing, defacing, destroying, abstracting, or purloining any nomination or voting paper after the same has been duly filled up. By s. 11, if any person at any election of mayor, councillors, auditors, or assessors for any borough, is guilty of bribery, he is for every such offence to forfeit 40s. to any person who sues for the same in any county court, with full costs of suit ; and any person offending in any case in which, under the Act or Acts for the time being in force with respect to the election of members to serve in Parliament for boroughs in England and Wales, the name of the offender may be expunged from the list of voters (being lawfully convicted thereof), is for the term of six years to be disabled from voting in any election in such borough, or in any municipal or parliamentary election whatever, in any part of the United Kingdom, and is for such term to be disabled from holding, exercising, or enjoying any office or franchise to which he shall then, or at any time afterwards, be entitled as a burgess of such borough, as if such person were naturally dead. Section 12 enacts that everything which would be \" bribery \" at a parliamentary, shall also be a bribery at a municipal election. Section 13 gives an appeal to the borough quarter sessions from any conviction under this Act ; and s. 14 provides that all proceedings for enforcing any pains, penalties, forfeitures, or convictions under this Act must be commenced * The offence of personation is complete when a person not the voter hands in a nomination paper to the polling officer, and it is immaterial that he does not persist, but answers \" No,\" when asked if he is a voter. \u2014 Queen v. Hague, 33 L. J., M.C., 81. H"], [116, "98 ENGLISH MUNICIPAL INSTITUTIONS ; within six calendar months from the time when the matter of such proceedings arose. The Act 32 & 33 Viet., c. 55, enacts, by s. 3, that a councillor or alderman may reside within fifteen miles of borough. By s. 4, when any borough, consisting of less than four wards, shall at any time hereafter be divided into a greater number of wards, the qualification for an alderman or councillor of such borough shall not be increased or altered in consequence of such division, but shall continue the same as if such borough consisted of less than four wards. Section 5 provides that proprietors of shares in companies are not to be deemed contractors, &c, and not to be disqualified from election to municipal offices by reason of holding such shares. The Act 32 & 33 Viet., c. 63, is for the abolition of imprisonment for debt, and for the punishment of fraudulent debtors, and for other purposes. By s. 21 it is enacted that \" the provisions of the Act of the session of the 5th and 6th years of William IV., c. 76, for the regulation of municipal corporations, sees. 52 and 53, as to the dis qualification of mayors, aldermen, and town councillors having been declared bankrupt, or having compounded by deed with their creditors, shall extend to every arrangement or composition by a mayor, alderman, or town councillor with his creditors under the Bankruptcy Act, 1869, whether the same is made by deed or otherwise.\" The Act 34 & 35 Victoria, c. 67, s. 2, repeals section four of \" The Municipal Corporations Act, 1859,\" (22 Viet. c. 35,) and in lieu thereof enacts as follows : \u2014 \" On the division of any borough into wards, the revising barrister shall apportion all the councillors for such borough amongst the wards into which it shall have been so divided ; and in case of the alteration of the number and boundaries of the wards of any borough already divided into wards, the revising barrister shall apportion the couucillors for the wards so altered amongst the new wards in such manner as to provide, so far as may be practicable, for such councillors continuing to represent as large a number as possible of their former constituents ; and every councillor for the borough so divided, or for the wards so altered, as the case may be, shall hold his office in the ward to which he may be assigned by the revising barrister for the same time that he would have held it had the said borough or wards remained undivided or unaltered.\" The Act 35 & 36 Victoria, c. 60, in the words of the preamble, makes provision for the better prevention of corrupt practices at municipal elections, and for establishing a tribunal for the trial of the validity of such elections. It commences by (s. 3) providing"], [117, "THEIR GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT. 99 that the definition of \" bribery,\" \" treating,\" \" undue influence,\" and \" personation,\" shall be the same for a municipal as for a parlia- mentary election. Then by s. 4, where it is found by the report of an election court acting under the provisions of this Act, that any corrupt practice has been committed by, or with the knowledge and consent of, any candidate at an election, such candidate shall be deemed to have been personally guilty of corrupt practices at the election, and his election, if he has been elected, shall be void, and he shall (whether he was elected or not), during seven years from the date of the report, be subject to the following disqualifications, viz. : \u2014 (1.) He shall be incapable of holding or exercising any muni- cipal office or franchise, and of having his name placed on the register, or voting at any municipal election. (2.) He shall be incapable of acting as a justice of the peace, and of holding any judicial office. (3.) He shall be incapable of being elected to, and. of sitting or voting in, Parliament. (4.) He shall be incapable of being registered or voting as a parliamentary voter. (5.) He shall be incapable of being employed by any candidate in any parliamentary or municipal election. (6.) He shall be incapable of acting as overseer or as guardian of the poor. If any person is, upon an indictment or infor- mation, found guilty of any corrupt practice at an election, or is in any action or proceeding adjudged to pay a penalty or forfeiture for any corrupt practice at an election, he shall, whether he was a candi- date at the election or not, be subject, during seven years from the date of the conviction op judgment, to all the disqualifications mentioned in this section. By s. 5, if it is found by an election court acting under the provisions of this Act that a candidate has by an agent been guilty of any corrupt practice at an alection, or that any act hereinafter in this Act declared to be an offence against this Act has been committed at an election by a candidate, or by an agent for a candidate with the candidate's knowledge and consent, the candidate shall, during the period for which he was elected to serve, or for which, if elected, he might have served, be disqualified from being elected to and for holding any municipal office in the borough for which the election was held, and if he was elected, his election shall be void. By s. 6 an election for a borough or a ward thereof shall be wholly avoided by such general corruption, bribery, treating, or intimidation at the election for such borough or ward as would by the common law of Parliament avoid an election of members to serve in Parliament for a parliamentary borough. Sections 7 to 11 prohibit paid canvassers and payment for conveyance of voters, and make pro vision for prosecutions for corrupt practices, for striking off votes on a h 2"], [118, "100 ENGLISH MUNICIPAL INSTITUTIONS ; scrutiny, and as to cases of alleged personation. Tbe second part of the Act, commencing with s. 12, points out the mode in which a municipal election may be questioned. By s. 12 the election of any person at an election for a borough or ward may be questioned by petition before an election court constituted as hereinafter in this Act provided, and hereinafter in this Act referred to as the \" court,\" on the ground that the election was as to the borough or ward wholly avoided by general bribery, treating, undue influence, or personation, or on the ground that the election of such person was avoided by corrupt practices or offences against this Act committed at the election, or on the ground that he was at the time of the election disqualified for election to the office for which the election was held, or on the ground that he was not duly elected by a majority of lawful votes. Section 13 contains a series of provisions as to form, signature, time and mode of presentation of a petition complaining of a municipal election to the Common Pleas Division of the High Court. By s. 14 an election court for the trial of petitions under this Act is to be con stituted of a barrister qualified and appointed as hereinafter provided, without a jury. A petition (s. 15) is to be tried in open court, and notice of the time and place at which it will be tried is to be given not less than seven days before the day on which the trial is held. It must be tried within the borough to which it relates ; unless it appears to the superior court that special circumstances exist which render it desirable that the petition should be tried elsewhere. This and the following section contain numerous provisions as to the mode of procedure, &c, at the trial, while s. 17 includes provisions for the withdrawal and abatement of petitions, enacting, amongst other things, that a petition shall be withdrawn without the leave of the court or superior court upon special application, to be made in and at the prescribed manner, time, and place. The remaining sections contain various provisions with respect to procedure, costs, &c. The Act 36 & 37 Viet., c. 86, disqualifies every person who, under the Education Act of 1870, is disqualified, by a conviction for corrupt practices at any election, from exercising any franchise for any term of years, from holding any municipal office. The Act 38 & 39 Victoria, c. 40, is a very important one, as it now constitutes the law regulating the mode of conducting municipal elections. It will, therefore, be necessary to state its provisions rather fully, and indeed to give the most important sections text ually. By s. 1, the following provisions are enacted and apply to nominations at all municipal elections of councillors, auditors, and assessors after the passing of this Act: (1.) Nine days at least before"], [119, "THEIR GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT. 101 any such election the town clerk shall prepare, sign, and publish a notice in the form No. 1 set forth in the first schedule to this Act, or to the like effect, by causing the same to be placed on the door ot* the town hall, and in some conspicuous parts of the borough or ward for which any such election is to be held. (2.) At any such election every candidate shall be nominated in writing ; the writing shall be subscribed by two enrolled burgesses of such borough or ward as proposer and seconder, and by eight other enrolled burgesses of such borough or ward as assenting to the nomination. Each candidate shall be nominated by a separate nomination paper, but the same burgesses, or any of them, may subscribe as many nomination papers as there are vacancies to be filled, but no more. Every person nominated shall be enrolled on the burgess roll of the borough, or a person whose name is inserted in the separate list at the end of the burgess roll, as provided by s. 3 of the Act 32 and 33 Victoria, c. 55, and shall be otherwise qualified to be elected. The nomination paper shall state the surname and other names of the person nominated, with his place of abode and description, and shall be in the form No. 2 set forth in the first schedule to this Act, or to the like effect. And the town clerk shall provide nomination papers, and shall supply any enrolled burgess with as many nomination papers as may be required, and shall, at the request of any such person, fill up a nomination paper in manner presoribed by this Act. (3.) Every nomination paper subscribed as aforesaid shall be delivered by the candidate himself, or his proposer or seconder, to the town clerk, seven days at least before the day of election, and before five o'clock in the afternoon of the last day on which any such nomination paper may by law be delivered; the town clerk shall forthwith send notice of such nomination to each person nominated. The mayor shall attend at the town hall on the day next after the last day for the delivery of nominations to the town clerk, between the hours of two and four in the afternoon, and shall decide on the validity of every objection made to a nomination paper, such objection to be made in writing. The candidate nominated by such nomination paper, and one other person, appointed by or on behalf of the candidate as hereinafter mentioned, and no person other than aforesaid, shall, except for the purpose of assisting the mayor, be entitled to attend such proceedings, and each candidate and the person appointed by him shall, during the time appointed for the attendance of the mayor for the purposes of this section, have respectively power to object to the nomination paper of every person nominated at the same election. The decision of the mayor, which"], [120, "102 ENGLISH MUNICIPAL INSTITUTIONS J shall be given in writing, shall, if disallowing any objection to a nomination paper, be final, but if allowing the same, shall be subject to reversal on petition questioning the election or return. The appointment bv or on behalf of candidates of persons as aforesaid shall be made in writing under the hand of the candidate, or, in case he is absent from the United Kingdom, then under the hand of his proposer or seconder, and shall be delivered to the town clerk before five o'clock in the afternoon of the last day on which nomination papers may by law be delivered. The town clerk shall at least four days before the day of election cause the surnames and other names of all persons duly nominated, with their respective places of abode and descriptions, and the names of the persons subscribing their respective nomination papers as proposers and seconders, to be printed and placed on the door of the town hall, and in some conspicuous parts of the borough or ward for which such election is to be held. (4.) Section 8 of the Act of 22 Viet. c. 35, so far as the same is now in force, shall apply to nominations of councillors, auditors, and assessors, duly made and allowed under this Act. Section 3 of the Ballot Act, 1872, shall apply to nomination papers under this Act, and so applied, the words \" returning officer \" shall be taken to include town clerk in reference to the delivery of such nomination papers. By s. 2 the nomina- tion of a person who is absent from the United Kingdom is to be void, unless his written consent, given, within one month of the day of his nomination, before two witnesses, be produced at the time of his nomination. Section 3 authorises the mayor to appoint officers for taking the poll. By s. 4 the provisions contained in rules 16 and 19 of the first schedule to the Ballot Act, 1872, are not to apply to any such election, but the mayor is to furnish every polling station with such number of compartments in which the voters can mark their votes screened from observation, and furnish each presiding officer with such number of ballot papers as in the judgment of the mayor shall be necessary for effectually taking the poll at such election in other respects in the manner provided by the Ballot Act, 1872. Where more candidates are nominated than there are vacancies to be supplied, the mayor must at least four days before the day of election give such public notice as may be required by law, of the situation, division, and allotment of polling places for taking the poll at any municipal election, and of the description of persons entitled to vote thereat and at the several polling stations. Section 5 makes the fact of a person's name appearing on the burgess roll for the time being in force in the borough, or on the ward list for the"], [121, "103 THEIR GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT. time being in force for the ward, conclusive proof of his right to sign a nomination paper or vote at an election. Section 7 provides that where more candidates are nominated at any municipal election than there are vacancies to be filled at such election, any of such candidates may withdraw from his candidature by notice signed by him and delivered to the town clerk not later than two o'clock in the afternoon of the day next after the last day for the delivery of nomination papers to the town clerk ; that these notices are to take effect in the order in which they are delivered to the town clerk ; and that no notice is to have effect so as to reduce the number of candidates ultimately stand ing nominated below the number of the vacancies to be filled. Sections 8 and 9 enact that notices by mayor or town clerk may comprise the several wards of borough, and fix the time of holding election on extraordinary vacancies ; while s. 10 gives power to town councils to divide wards into polling places as they may think fit. The Act 41 and 42 Victoria, c. 26, (The Parliamentary and Muni cipal Registration Act, 1878,) has been already fully noticed at pages 72-75. The extreme number of councillors named in 5 and 6 William IV., c. 76, is 48, and although special and local Acts of Parliament have, in some instances, varied the warding and representation, that num ber has not been exceeded. (2) Election of Aldermen. \u2014 As to this, the 25th clause of the Municipal Corporations Act, 1835, provides : \u2014 \" That in every borough shall be elected, at the time and in the manner hereinafter mentioned, one fit person who shall be and be called ' the mayor ' of such borough ; and a certain number of fit persons who shall be and be called ' aldermen ' of such borough ; and a certain number of other fit persons who shall be and be called ' the councillors ' of such borough ; and such mayor, aldermen, and councillors for the time being shall be and be called the council of such borough ; and the number of persons to be elected councillors of such borough shall be the number of persons in that behalf mentioned in conjunction with the name of such borough in the schedules to this Act annexed ; and the number of persons to be so elected aldermen shall be one-third of the number of persons so to be elected councillors ; and on the ninth day of November in this present year (1835) the councillors first to be elected under the provisions of this Act, and on the ninth day of November, 1838, and in every third succeeding year, the council for the time being of every borough shall elect from the councillors, or from the persons qualified to be councillors, the aldermen of such borough, or so many as shall be needed to supply the places of those who then shall go out of office according to the provisions hereinafter contained ; and that upon the ninth day of November in the year 1838, and in every third succeeding year, one half of the number appointed as aforesaid to be the whole number of the aldermen of every borough, shall go out of office first ; and the councillors immediately after the first election of aldermen shall appoint who"], [122, "104 ENGLISH MUNICIPAL INSTITUTIONS; shall be the aldermen who shall go out of office in the year 1838, and thereafter those who shall go out of office shall always be those who have been aldermen for the longest time without re-election : provided always that any alderman so going out of office may be forthwith re-elected if then qualified as herein provided ; provided also that the alderman so going out of office shall not be entitled to vote in the election of a new alderman.\" * Whenever an extraordinary vacancy takes place in the office of alderman of any borough, the council are, within ten days after such vacancy occurs, on a day to be fixed by the mayor, to elect either from the councillors or from the persons qualified to be councillors, and every person thus elected is to hold office until the time when the person inthe room of whom he was chosen would regularly have gone out of office. The Act 7 William IV., and 1 Viet,, c. 78, s. 14, enacts that elections of aldermen, after the passing of this Act, are to take place in the following manner : that is to say, every member of the council entitled to vote in that election may vote for any number of persons not exceeding the number of aldermen then to be chosen, by person ally delivering at such meeting to the mayor or chairman of the meeting a voting paper containing the christian names and surnames of the persons for whom he votes, with their respective places of abode and descriptions, such paper being previously signed with the name of the member of council voting ; and the mayor or chairman of the meeting, as soon as all the voting papers have been delivered to him, is openly to produce and read the same, and is immediately afterwards to deliver them to the town clerk, to be kept amongst the records of the borough ; and in case of equality of votes amongst those entitled to vote, the mayor or chairman is to have a casting vote, whether or not he may have been entitled to vote in the first instance. By s 16, in case of the illness or incapacity to act of any alderman of a ward, the mayor may appoint another alderman to act in his name. The Act 6 & 7, Viet., c. 80, provides that when a greater number of persons have been elected, or claim to have been elected aldermen of a borough, than are authorised by the Municipal Corporations Act, the council are, before proceeding to any other business, at the quarterly meeting held on the ninth of November, to declare which * Aldermen going out of office cannot vote for their successors, but they are entitled to vote in the election of mayor, although the candidate for whom they vote be an alderman, and the person elected be an outgoing alderman. It has also been held that although an outgoing alderman elected mayor, and afterwards presiding at the election of aldermen, might at such election give a casting vote, yet he could not give an original vote."], [123, "THEIR GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT. 105 of the persons so elected or claiming, to the number specified by the Act, shall be the aldermen of the borough. References to the election, qualifications, and duties of aldermen occur under the foregoing and succeeding subdivisions. (3.) Election of Mayor. \u2014 We have now to describe the time and mode in which the head of a corporation is chosen. It is provided by the Municipal Act, that on the ninth day of November the council of the borough shall hold one of their quarterly meetings (as to which see page 108), and that on that day the first business they transact shall be to elect out of the aldermen or councillors a fit person to be mayor * during the ensuing year ; f and in case a vacancy occurs in the office of mayor during any year, in consequence of the person who has been elected thereto not accepting the same, or dying, or ceasing to hold the said office, the council are, within ten days after such vacancy (notice of the meeting for that purpose being given by the town clerk), to elect another person to be mayor for the remainder of the current year. If any person act as mayor (this section also applies to the office of alderman, councillor, auditor, or assessor), for any borough, without having made the required declaration, or without being duly qualified at the time of making such declaration, or after he shall cease to be qualified, or after he shall have become disqualified, he is liable for every such offence to a penalty of \u00a350 (half to go to the informer), which may be sued for by any burgess within three months after the commission ot the offence.-!: But all the proceedings of any person * The mayor for the time being of every borough is a justice of the peace of and for such borough, and continues to be so during the next succeeding year after he ceases to be so, unless he becomes disqualified to act. During his mayoralty he has precedence in all places within the borough, including by a subsequent Act (24 & 25 Viet. c. 75, s. 2) precedence at meetings of magistrates within the borough. In boroughs which return members of Parliament other than the town of Berwick-upon-Tweed, and cities and towns which are counties of themselves, he is the returning officer of all parliamentary elections ; and in case he be dead, absent, or otherwise incapable of acting when he is required to perform the duties of that office, the council are forthwith to appoint one of the aldermen to act in his stead. The mayor may be paid such a salary as the council think fit. ! Under 6 & 7 William IV. c. 105, s. 4, the mayor continues in office not only for the whole year from one month of November to the following one, but until his successor has accepted the office, and has made and signed the requisite declaration. J By 6 & 7 Will., c. 104, s. 7, no person enrolled on the burgess roll for the time being and who shall act as mayor, alderman, councillor, auditor, or assessor ofaborough, shall be liable to any penalty for so acting, on the ground that he was not entitled to be on the burgess list of such borough."], [124, "106 ENGLISH MUNICIPAL INSTITUTIONS J in possession of the office of mayor, &c., and acting as such, will be as valid as if he had been duly qualified.* A person bribing, or receiving a bribe, in any election of a mayor or other municipal officer, is, by the Act, rendered liable to a penalty of \u00a350, to be recovered by action in one of the superior courts ; and on being duly convicted of the offence, he is for ever disabled to vote in any election in such borough, or in any municipal or parliamentary election in any part of the United Kingdom ; and from holding, exercising, or enjoying any office or franchise to which he then shall or at any time afterwards may be entitled as a burgess of such borough, as if such person were naturally dead. But if a person so offending does, within twelve months after the election, and before he has been himself convicted, discover another offender (\" so that such other person be thereon convicted\") he will be discharged from all penalties and disabilities which he may have incurred. The action for the penalty must in any case be commenced within two years after the commission of the offence.! The Act 6 & 7 Viet., c. 89, provides that no election of a mayor shall be liable to be questioned by reason of any defect in the title of the person elected to the office of alderman or councillor, unless by quo tcarranto within twelve calendar months after his election to the said office of alderman or councillor ; and all elections of corporate officers not thus called in question are to be deemed valid. The Act 16 and 17 Victoria, c. 79, provides, inter alia, that the mayor of a borough may, during his illness or absence from the gr The title of Ex-mayor is generally supposed to be confined to the immediate past mayor, but it would be difficult to logically dispute the claim of any person, who has held the office of mayor, to the designation, as the following quotation from Littre will shew : \u2014 Ex: Particule qui se joint par le trait d'union a certains mots pour exprimer l'etat ou la position anterieure d'lme personne : un ex-ministre, mr ex-depute. Etym. : Lat.: ex ; Grec : \u00ab'f, hoi-s. * It has been a subject of debate whether, in the event of the re-election of a person to the office of mayor, it is necessary for him to again take the oath as a justice of the peace (if he be not a permanent magistrate of the borough), when only half of the period for which he originally qualified to act has lapsed, but a strict interpretation of the statute seems to leave little room for doubt that if the office of mayor is held for two years in succession without the oath being again taken at the commencement of the second year, any magisterial acts which might be performed in the year after vaca tion of office (as immediate ex-mayor) would be invalid, because of the application of the original oath of qualification only to the year of office being then entered upon and one year after. ! See page 97 (as to 22 Viet., c. 35), and page 98 (as to 35 & 36 Viet., c. 60.) Four teen days' notice of the intention to bring such action must be given to the person offending."], [125, "THEIR GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT. 107 borough, appoint an alderman or councillor to act as his deputy ; * that if in any borough the number of aldermen does not exceed the number of wards, the mayor shall, in the case of the illness or incapacity to act of any alderman at an election, appoint a councillor (not being a councillor of the ward) to preside at the election ; that vacancies in the offices of councillor, auditor7 or assessor, are to be filled up within ten days after notice given thereof, by two burgesses, to the mayor or town clerk ; that the mayor may appoint a substitute for a deceased assessor until his successor be elected ; and that in the case of an equality of votes for the election of alderman, the mayor shall have a casting vote. The Act 30 and 31 Victoria, c. 75, s. 4, provides that every person holding any corporate office may attend and be present at any place ofjDublic meeting for religious worship in England, Ireland or Scotland in his robe, gown, or other peculiar habit of his office, or with the ensign or insignia of or belonging to the same, without incurring any forfeiture of office or penalty for such attendance. The provisions of the law affecting any material point in the election of the members of a council have, thus far, been exhausted, but, as previously remarked, the present and two preceding sub divisions comprise quotations which apply alike to mayor, aldermen, and councillors. (4.) The Council \u2014 its Meetings and its Chief Officers. \u2014 The Council being duly constituted, we have now to consider what are its powers, and what are the regulations laid down for the transaction of business. The Municipal Act prescribes the mode in which meetings are to be called, and in which their deliberations are to be conducted ; and it determines what business may or may not be transacted at any meeting. This is so important a section, that it will probably be most satisfactory to give it entire. It is as follows : \u2014 \" And be it enacted that all acts whatsoever authorised or required by virtue of this Act to be done by the Council of such borough, and all questions of adjournment, or others that may come before such Council, may be done and decided by the majority of the members of the Council who shall be present at any meeting held in pursuance of this Act, the whole number present at such meeting being not less than one-third part of the mimber of the whole Council ; * The deputy may do all that the mayor could do in his official capacity except act as justice of the peace (if he be not one), or preside at a meeting of the council (unless specially appointed by the meeting so to do)."], [126, "108 ENGLISH MUNICIPAL INSTITUTIONS; and at all such meetings the mayor, if present, shall preside ; and the mayor, or in the absence of the mayor, such alderman, or in the absence of all the aldermen, such councillor, as the members of the Council then assembled shall choose to be the chairman of that meeting, shall have a second or casting vote in all cases of equality of votes ; and minutes of the proceedings of all such meetings * shall be drawn up and fairly entered in a book to be kept for that purpose, and shall be signed by the mayor, alderman, or councillor presiding at such meeting, and the said minutes shall be open to the inspection of any burgess at all reasonable times on payment of a fee of one shilling : [By subsequent Acts the burgess is further permitted to copy or make extracts from the minutes.] Provided always that, previous to any meeting of the Council held by virtue of this Act, a notice of the time and place of such intended meeting shall be given three clear days at least before such meeting, by fixing the said notice on or near the town hall of the borough, and such notice shall be signed by the mayor, who shall have power to call a meeting of the cojjncil as often as he shall think proper ; and in case the mayor shall refuse to call any such meeting after a requisition for that purpose, signed by five members of the council at the least, shall have been presented to him, it shall be lawful for the said five members to call a meeting of the council by giving such notice as is hereinbefore required in that behalf, such notice to be signed by the said members instead of the mayor, and stating therein the business proposed to be transacted at such meeting ; and in every case a summons to attend the council, specifying the business to be transacted at such meeting, signed by the town clerk, shall be left at the usual place of abode of every member of the council, or at the premises in respect of which he is enrolled a burgess, three clear days at least before such meeting ; and no business shall be transacted at such meeting other than is specified in the notice. Provided always that there shall be in every borough four quarterly meetings in every year, at which the council shall meet for the transaction of general business, and no notice shall need to be given of the business t to be transacted on such quarterly days ; and the said quarterly meetings shall be holden at noon, on the ninth, or, if the ninth day of November shall fall on a Sunday, on the day following, and at such hour on such other three days before the first day of November then next following as the council at the quarterly meeting in November shall decide : and the first business transacted at the quarterly meeting in November shall be the election of Mayor. The Council are empowered to appoint as many committees as they think fit, for any purpose which, in their discretion, would be better managed by such committees ; but the acts of such committees must be submitted to the Council for their approval. One of the most important powers conferred upon the Council * The minutes must be actually made at the meeting, and must be signed by the Mayor (or Chairman), there and then. j- At an adjourned quarterly meeting notice must be given of any business which was not actually begun at the quarterly meeting ; but of business actually commenced no notice is requisite."], [127, "THEIR GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT. 109 under the Act, is that of making bye-laws. With respect to this, it is enacted that \u2014 \" It shall be lawful for the council of any borough to make such bye-laws as to them shall seem meet for the good rule and government of the borough, and for the prevention and suppression of all such nuisances as are not already punishable in a summary manner by virtue of any Act in force throughout such borough, and to appoint by such bye-laws such fines as they shall deem necessary for the prevention and suppression of such offences : Provided that no fine so to be appointed shall exceed the sum of \u00a35, and that no such bye-laws shall be made unless at least two-thirds of the whole number of the council shall be present : Provided that no such bye-laws shall be of any force until the expiration of forty days after the same, or a copy thereof, shall have been sent, sealed with the seal of the said borough, to one of His Majesty's principal Secretaries of State, and shall have been affixed on the outer door of the town hall or in some other public place within such borough ; and if at any time within the said period of forty days His Majesty, with the advice of his Privy Council, shall disallow the same bye-law or any part thereof, such bye-law or the part thereof disallowed shall not come into operation : Provided also that it shall be lawful for His Majesty, if he shall think fit, at any time within the same period of forty days, to enlarge the time within which such bye-law, if disallowed, shall not come into operation : Provided also, that it shall be lawful for His Majesty, if he shall think fit, at any time within the said period of forty days, to enlarge the time within which such bye-law, if not disallowed, shall not come into force ; and no such bye-law shall, in that case, come into force until after the expiration of such enlarged time.\" The provisions of the Act relative to offences punishable upon summary convictions are applicable to all offences committed in breach of the bye -laws. With respect to the bye -laws, it is settled by decided cases that they must be reasonable and not inconsistent with any statute or with the general principles of the law of the land : that a bye-law can be made for the regulation of any trade carried on within the borough, but not in restraint of it ; that this power of all regulations still remains, notwithstanding s. 14 of the Act abolishes all exclusive rights of trading ; and that the validity of a bye-law may be tested and tried in an action brought to recover the penalty, or, if the mode of enforcing the penalty be by distress, by an action of trespass. The selection of the public officers of the borough is also one of the principal duties of the Council. The Municipal Commissioners discovered in 1833 that the ancient regime boasted no less than 76 designations of principal and 286 designations of inferior officials ; or in all 362 different offices. Those of recorder and town-clerk (and that of sheriff in counties of cities and towns) were, however, naturally regarded as second in importance only to that of mayor. The Act of 1835 vested the appointment of recorders in the Crown"], [128, "110 ENGLISH MUNICIPAL INSTITUTIONS; without reference to the councils; the previous manner of their election is described in the Tables of Section 6 of this Part (The Municipal Judges and Magistracy), and the subjoined classification shews the variety of the abrogated forms of appointing the town clerk in cities and boroughs now governed under the Act of 1835 : \u2014 I. \u2014 Cities and Boroughs in which the appointment of Town Clerk was vested in the self-elect council, by a particular class of it, or the whole of the self-elect corporation, with the period of duration of office (viz. \u2014 for life, annually, or during the pleasure of the council) : \u2014 a Signifies that the appointment was subject to the approval of the Crown. *** The appointments held subject to \"good behaviour\" are included in the term '* during pleasure.\" Those not specifically defined, but which were presumably for life, are included in the term \"life.\" Abingdon (during pleasure) Banbury (during pleasure) Barnstaple (during pleasure) Basingstoke (life) Bath (life) Beaumaris (during pleasure) Beccles (life) Beverley (annually) Bewdley (during pleasure) Bideford (during pleasure) Bodmin (life) Boston (during pleasure) Brecon (life) Bridgwater (during pleasure) \u00ab Bridport (life) Bristol (life) Bury St. Edmunds (Hfe) Canterbury (life) Cardigan (life) Carlisle (life) Chard (life) Chester (life) a Chesterfield (life) Chichester (during pleasure) Chippenham (life) Chipping Norton (life) a Chipping Wycombe (during pleasure) Congleton (life) Coventry (life) Dartmouth (life) Daventry (life) Deal (during pleasure) a Denbigh (life) Devizes (life) st Doncaster (life) Dorchester (life) Dover (annually) Droitwich (life) Durham (during pleasure) Exeter (life) Eye (life) Faversham (during pleasure) Folkestone (life) Glastonbury (life) a Gloucester (life) st Grantham (life) Gravesend (life) Guildford (annually) Hartlepool (during pleasure) Harwich (life) Haverfordwest (life) \u00ab Hedon (life) Hereford (life) st Hertford (during pleasure) Hythe (annually) Kendal (during pleasure) Kidderminster (life) Kingston-upon-Thames (life) Lancaster (life) Leicester (during pleasure) st Leominster (life) st Lichfield (during pleasure) Lincoln (life)"], [129, "THEIR GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT. 111 Liskeard (during pleasure) Liverpool (life) Louth (life) \u00ab Ludlow (life) Lyme Regis (life) Lymington (life) Maidenhead (during pleasure) !

The town clerk and treasurer must not be the same person. The treasurer of the borough must pay no money on account of the corporation, save only (1) in such case as is provided by the Act; or (2) upon the order in writing of the council, signed by three or more members of the council, and countersigned by the town clerk ; or (3) by order of the court of session of the peace for the borough, or of a justice of the peace acting in and for the borough in the discharge of his judicial duties, as is provided by the Act ; or (4) in such case as a court of session of the county, or a justice of the peace acting in and for a county in the discharge of his official duties, may make an order for the payment of money on tbe treasurer of such county ; or (5) for the payment of the salaries granted to any recorder or poHce magistrate. The town clerk, treasurer,* or other officers must, at such times during their tenure of office, or within three months after its termination, as the council may appoint, account for all moneys received and expended by them, and pay over any balance remaining in their hands to tbe treasurer or other person appointed to receive it. If they neglect or refuse to do this after three days' notice in writing, signed by three or more of the council, then, upon complaint made on behalf of the council, by such person as they may authorise for the purpose, a justice of the peace for the county, or other jurisdiction in which such officer shall be or reside,! rnay order the officer in question to be brought before any two justices of the said jurisdiction, and if it appears to them that any moneys remain due to the corporation, they may order the amount thereof to be levied by distress upon his goods.

It is, however, provided that no person shaU be detained in prison for merely want of sufficient distress for a longer space of time than three calendar months. And it must be further borne in mind, that the section to which we have just referred does not prevent or abridge any remedy by action against an officer offending in the manner we have described, or against the surety of any such officer. An officer cannot, however, be proceeded against both by action and in a summary manner. In addition to the officers which all councils are to appoint, the councils of cities and towns which are counties of themselves are empowered and required annually ! to elect a sheriff; and, in every borough in which a separate court of quarter sessions is holden, the council must also appoint a coroner! (who must not be an alderman or councillor). In boroughs which have no separate court of quarter sessions, the county coroners act.

The Municipal Judges and Magistracy. The Municipal Commissioners reported, in 1835, that in a great majority of the incorporated towns there prevailed a general distrust of the municipal magistracy, tainting with suspicion the local admin istration of justice, and often accompanied with contempt of the persons by whom the law is administered. It is not surprising, therefore, that the Act of 1835 made a sweeping change in the mode of appointment to the judicial offices of the reformed municipalities. The Recorder, sometimes called the Steward, was, under the ancient administration, mostly elected by the common council ; in some cases by the aldermen or superior body of the council ; and in others by the burgesses or freemen at large. The terms of the charters generally required him to be learned in the law \u2014 a condition frequently deemed to be complied with by electing a peer of the realm, whose status as a judge by the constitution of Parliament was held to come within that technical description. Where the office was held by the lord of the manor, or the individual commonly regarded as the \"patron\" of the borough, its functions were dis charged, almost without exception, by a deputy ; the town clerk being invariably nominated in that capacity. This unrestrained delegation and oft-times anomalous combination of important duties not unseldom led to very mischievous results ; the nominal connection of many of the recorders with their boroughs being only a form to cover the exercise of an unhealthy control. Few of them resided within the jurisdiction with which they were identified, although looked upon as the principal legal advisers of the corporate bodies. They were mostly magistrates within their boroughs and quorum judges of the courts of general and quarter sessions and courts of record where those existed. Column 8 of Table 1 in this Section sets out the mode of election observed in the cities and boroughs named in the Act of 1835, and shows where the consent of the Crown was requisite to the appointment. It may be said that, universally, the municipal magistrates were, previous to the year 1835, locally elected. Their authority was, however, very irregularly distributed, and too often the persons selected to exercise it could only advance political partisanship as a reason for their elevation to a dignified and honourable position. The gross incompetence of many of the magistrates naturally rendered their administration of the law extremely defective, and excited just suspicion and indignation amongst the inhabitants. It was not often that persons outside the common council were chosen for the office,"], [146, "128 ENGLISH MUNICIPAL INSTITUTIONS ; and where there were aldermen they were usually tbe favoured class. Tbe Mayor was always the chief magistrate wherever a criminal jurisdiction, however limited, was in practice; the Mayors of Lancaster, Liverpool, and Preston being also ex-officio magistrates of tbe county. The borough jurisdictions were occasionally concurrent with those of the county magistrates, but mostly exclusive; even where they were not, the county magistrates rarely interfered. Column 2 to 9 of the Tables following hereon supply, with those of the next Section of this Part (The Criminal and Civil Jurisdictions), details descriptive of the composition, powers, and number of the abolished local tribunals, and magistracies. The uniform system of administering justice in the corporate towns as provided by the Municipal Act of 1835, bas undergone but slight amendment. The borough justices at present consist of the mayor during his year of office and one year after his mayoralty determines, the recorder and such persons as the Crown may appoint by virtue of section 98 : \u2014 \" and be it enacted that it shall be lawful for His Majesty from time to time to assign to so many persons as he shall think fit His Majesty's commission to act as justices of the peace in and for each borough, and in and for each of the counties of cities and towns respectively named in tbe schedules of tbis Act, to which His Majesty may be pleased upon tbe petition of the council to grant a commission of the peace : Provided, nevertheless, that every person so assigned shall reside within the borough for which he shall be so assigned, or within seven miles of such borough or some part thereof, during such time as be shall act as a justice of the peace in and for such borough.'-1 A borough justice need not have such qualification by estate as is required for a county justice, provided be be not disquabfied by law to act as a justice of the peace from any other cause or on any other account than in respect of estate ; nor need he be a burgess of the borough in and for which he is assigned to act as a justice. Summonses and warrants issued by tbe borough justices may be served and executed within the county in whicb the borough is situated, or within seven miles from such borough, without the endorsement of a county justice.

If the council of any borough think it requisite tbat a salaried police magistrate or magistrates be appointed within such borough, they are empowered to make a bye-law * fixing the amount of the salary which such magistrate is to receive.

The Council of any borough to which a separate commission of the peace is granted are required to provide one or more fit and suitable office or offices, to be called ' tbe police office ' or ' offices ' of the borough, for the purpose of transacting the business of the justices ot such borougb.

Nor is it lawful for the clerk to the justices to be by himself or his partner interested or employed in the prosecution of any offender committed for trial by the justices to whom he is clerk. Any person offending against this enactment is liable to a fine of \u00a3100, one half of which is to go to the borough fund, and the other half (with full costs of suit) to any person who will sue for the same in any of Her Majesty's courts of record at Westminster. .Notwithstanding the grant of a separate commission of the peace to a borough, if it have not also a separate court of quarter sessions, the county justices can still exercise jurisdiction within its limits.* But no part of any borough in and for which a separate court of quarter sessions of the peace is holden is within the jurisdiction of the justices of any county from which such borough before the passing of the Act was exempt, any law, statute, letters patent, charter, grant, or custom to the contrary notwithstanding. The council of any borough who desire that a separate court of quarter sessions should be holden for such borough, may signify their wish by petition to Her Majesty in Council, setting forth the grounds of the application, the state of the gaol, and the salary which they are willing to pay the recorder. Thereupon the Crown may grant a separate court of quarter sessions for such borough, and may appoint as recorder thereof a barrister of not less than five years' standing, who is to hold his office during good behaviour. If a vacancy in the office occurs, the Crown has also the right of filling it up. The recorder is to be a justice of the peace for the borough, and is to have precedence therein next after the mayor. He is ineligible to repre sent the borough in Parliament, or to serve as an alderman, councillor, or police magistrate thereof. In case of sickness or unavoidable absence, he is empowered to appoint, under his hand and seal, a deputy recorder (being a barrister of five years' standing) to act for him at the quarter sessions of the peace then next ensuing. The council are to appoint the clerk of the peace ; but the recorder has nevertheless the power of removing him in case of misconduct in his office. Before entering upon their offices, both the recorder and the * In practice, the county magistrates, as such, never adjudicate in a borough which has a separate commission of the peace."], [149, "131 THEIR GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT borough justices are to make before the mayor, or any two or more of the aldermen or councillors of the borough, a declaration that they will faithfully and impartially fulfil their duties according to tbe best of their judgment and ability. Tbe recorder is to hold, once in every quarter (or oftener if he thinks fit, or Her Majesty so directs), a court of quarter sessions, in which he is sole judge, and which has cognizance of all crimes cognizable by county quarter sessions.* The recorder, has, however, no power to make or levy a county rate, or a rate in the nature of a county rate, or to license houses for the sale of excisable liquors, or generally to exercise any of the powers vested in the town council. In the absence of the recorder or deputy recorder at the time fixed for holding the quarter sessions, the mayor may open and adjourn the court, and may respite all recognizances entered by persons for their appearance there ; but be cannot do anything else. The authority of tbe recorder of a borough is not determinal by Her Majesty's judges coming into the county, and acting there under their commissions of oyer and terminer and general gaol delivery ; he may, therefore, hold his quarter sessions of the peace during the time of the assizes in the same county. Schedule A of the Act prescribes, as before observed (page 40), that the cities and boroughs named therein are to have a commission ofthe peace; those comprised in Schedule B not being permitted one unless on petition or grant. No commission bas, however, been issued to Neath, although that borough is included in Schedule A ; the reason for this exclusion has not transpired. The Act 6 and 7 William IV., c. 105, intituled 'An Act for the better administration of Justice in certain Boroughs,' gave the county justices power to contract with the council of a borough in which there is a sufficient gaol, for the committal of county prisoners thereto, and authorised the trial of such persons by the court of quarter sessions, if there be one; enabled the recorder of a borough to try persons at the borough sessions, although they might have been com mitted for trial to a county prison more than two miles from the borougb ; and enacted that .the oaths to be taken by the recorder or the borough justices might be taken before the mayor or any two councillors without suing out or obtaining any special dedimus or other commission or authority for administering such oaths ; and that the powers heretofore vested by local Acts in the justices in quarter * See page 153 as to offences which are not within the cognizance of these Courts.

This Act also contains provisions in reference to courts of request, to courts of record, to the courts of quarter sessions of the Cinque Ports, and to the appointment of the vice-chancellor of the University of Cambridge to be a justice of the peace for the town. The Act 7 William IV. and 1 Victoria, c. 78, s. 31, provided that all offences committed within any borough, or the precincts thereof, against the provisions of any local Act of Parliament were in future to be cognizable by the borough magistrates. The Act 30 and 31 Victoria, c. 115, s. 2, enacts \" that a justice of the peace shall not be incapable of acting as a justice at any petty, or special, or general, or quarter sessions on the trial of an offence arising under an Act to be put in execution by a municipal corporation or a local board of health, or improvement commissioners, or trustees, or any other local authority by reason only of his being as one of several ratepayers, or as one of any other class of persons liable in common with the others to contribute to, or to be benefited by, any fund to the account of which the penalty payable in respect of such offence is directed to be carried, or of which it will form part, or to con tribute to any rate or expenses in diminution of which such penalty will go.\" The Act 32 and 33 Victoria, c. 23, extended the power of recorders to appoint deputies in certain cases, but it was practically superseded by a larger enactment \u2014 35 and 36 Victoria, c. 86, s. 9.* Column 12 of Tables 1 and 2 in this Section does not, by the omis sion of the mayors, immediate ex-mayors, and recorders, give the possible or actual numerical strength of the corporate magistracy for the present year (1879), but if three (mayor, immediate ex-mayor, and recorder) be added to the numbers for the quarter sessions cities and boroughs, and two (mayor and immediate ex-mayor) to the cities and boroughs not having quarter sessions, an increase of 577 is given, thus bringing the total possible strength to 3,264. The actual strength for 1879 may be stated at 3,170, which is the nearest approach to absolute accuracy that the individual inquiries which have been made permit of. The foregoing abstract of statutes applies in some points to the next Section, commencing on page 149.

The ordinary Criminal Courts of the corporate towns previous to 1835 were those of gaol delivery and of general and quarter sessions.! Their jurisdiction was extremely defective, and in some cases totally disproportioned to the importance of the town, or to the probable intelligence and respectability of its magistrates. For example, the borough of Dunwich, in Suffolk, with a population of 232, had a jurisdiction extending to capital felonies,! whilst the city of Bath, with a population of 50,817, had only a jurisdiction confined to offences cog nizable at petty sessions. The condition of concurrent or exclusive authority corresponded as little as the extent of the jurisdiction itself with the modern importance ofthe towns, or with the principles of expediency arising out of their situation, and their means of commu nication with the seat of county jurisdiction. The grant of exclusive power appeared to have depended entirely on accident or caprice. The practice of the Criminal and Civil Courts, the method of summoning and qualifications of jurors, and the mode of payment of prosecution expenses, will be best described in the identical words of the Municipal Commissioners in their report on these points. \" The courts of gaol delivery are found in very few places ; where they exist they are sometimes held under the charters, without any commission issuing from the Crown. Where no commission issues the magistrates are the sole judges. The time of holding these courts is sometimes discretionary with the corporate magistrates, sometimes regulated by the charter, and are, in practice, * The ninety-six Recorderships are now held by ninety persons \u2014 one person holding three appointments, and four persons two appointments each. t The terms \" general sessions \" and \" quarter sessions \" have frequently been held to imply a \" distinction without any practical difference,\" but that is not strictly so. The term \" quarter \" is applicable only to those sessions which were, or are held at four even periods within the year. Although the jurisdiction of the general sessions was the same as the quarter sessions, the former were sometimes (and in the case of some of the unreformed boroughs still are) held once, twice, or three times a year only. X Most of the corporate courts sent all serious cases to the county sessions or assizes, but some few (Berwick-upon-Tweed, Bristol, Canterbury, Exeter, and Rochester among the number) retained down to 1835, their chartered privileges of trying and executing criminals for capital offences."], [168, "150 ENGLISH MUNICIPAL INSTITUTIONS; opened at the same time as the quarter sessions. The same remark applies to the courts of general sessions.* The borough sessions seldom differ as to the times and manner of holding them from the county quarter sessions.\" * * * \" These (the local civil courts) in general have their origin in particular charters, but occasionally they exist by prescription. They vary considerably with regard to the nature of the actions which they may entertain. In some actions, real, personal, and mixed may be brought, and in general they have cognizance of all personal actions. The amount for which such actions can be brought is often unlimited (subject to the power of removal), while in several of the courts it is restrained to the recovery of debts under a given sum. Those courts, whose powers are most limited, are confined to suits where the debt or damage does not exceed 40s. In practice, suits for any other cause of action than debts, are seldom instituted in these courts, unless in some of the larger boroughs, where the ordinary kinds of action which occur at assizes are tried. ... It is only in the civil courts of the larger boroughs that the attendance of a jury is frequently required. * * Frequently not more than two or three actions are brought to trial in the course of a year, although more than a hundred writs may have been sued out.\" \" The juries are generally summoned from the inhabitants at large, without strict reference to any qualifications ; sometimes from the freemen alone. In the latter case, the number out of whom they are chosen is often inconveniently small. (At Pontefract the number was 26.) The members of the ruling body sometimes claim an exemption from serving on any of the borough juries ; in other cases the grand jury is summoned exclusively from them. * * In corporate counties the lists are commonly made out by the Sheriffs in the usual manner ; in other boroughs they are commonly struck in the office of the town clerk. In some towns one of the judges of the court has the power of striking the jury ; the mayor in several towns nominates the foreman of the grand jury, and very frequently settles the whole list after it comes from the town clerk's office.\" \" In many boroughs no fund is provided for the payment of the expenses of prosecutions ; in some they are paid out of the county rate ; in others out of a borough rate in the nature of a county rate ; in others out of the poor rate.\" The following classification shows the distribution of the criminal and civil jurisdictions previous to 1835.

Within ten days after the grant of a separate court of quarter sessions* to any borough, the council are to send a copy of such * The offences triable at borough quarter sessions are the same as those of which the county quarter sessions have cognizance, (see s. 105 of the Municipal Act of 1835,) viz., felonies \u2014 with certain limitations \u2014 and misdemeanours. The Criminal Code (Indictable Offences) Bill, as amended in Committee (May, 1879) proposes by s. 431, the abolition of the distinction between felony and misdemeanours. Under the original County Commission of the Peace which, almost in its present form, was settled by a conference of judges in 1590, and commanded by the then Lord Chancellor to be used, any one or more justices have not only all the ancient power touching the peace which the conservators of the peace had at the common law, but also that whole authority which has been added thereto by subsequent statutes.\u2014 ( Vide Pritchard's \"Practice and Procedure at Quarter Sessions, Sec.\") Until the passing of the Act 5 & 6 Victoria, c. 38, the justices in general and quarter sessions exercised jurisdiction over felonies with no limitation except that which sprung up, in practice, of abstaining from the more difficult and important cases, and sending them to the Local Names of Borough Civil Courts.

Modern public opinion, however, demanded the application, to intricate and important cases, of that knowledge and discrimination which could only be expected from the labour of a life devoted to legal pursuits, and which was not reasonably to be sought for in the compass of individual magistrates however well informed and upright in purpose. Consequently the Act just referred to was passed. It provided as follows : \u2014 \" That after the passing of this Act neither the Justices of the Peace acting in and for any County, Riding, Division, or Liberty, nor the Recorder of any Borough, shall at any Session of the Peace, or at any adjournment thereof, try any Person or Persons for any Treason, Murder, or Capital Felony, or for any Felony which, when committed by a Person not previously convicted of Felony, is punishable by Transportation beyond the Seas [altered to Penal Servitude by 20 & 21 Viet., c. 3, s. 6] for Life, or for any of the following Offences, (that is to say,) 1.

The 24 & 25 Viet., c. 96, s. 87, pre cluded frauds by agents, bankers, or factors in embezzling money or selling securities, &c, entrusted to them under directions in writing, or chattels, or valuable security held for safe custody or special purposes (the offences of keeping and publishing of false accounts and destroying of documents by directors and officers of public companies are also included) being tried at any court of general or quarter sessions of the peace.

With respect to the payment by boroughs of the expenses of prose cuting prisoners at the assizes, s. 113 of the Municipal Act enacts as follows : \u2014 \"And whereas by an Act made in the seventh year of His late Majesty George IV., intituled ' An Act for improving the Administration of Criminal Justice in England and Wales,' it was enacted that all sums directed to be paid by virtue of that Act in respect of felonies and misdemeanours therein enume rated, committed in liberties, franchises, cities, towns, and places which do not contribute to the payment of county rate, should be paid as therein is directed ; be it therefore enacted that all sums directed to be paid by virtue of the last recited Act, in respect of felonies and such misdemeanours as aforesaid, com mitted or supposed to have been committed in any borough in which a separate county quarter sessions of the peace shall be holden, shall be paid out of the borough fund of such borough, anything in the said Act notwithstanding, and the order of court shall in every case be directed to the treasurer of such borough instead of to the treasurer of the county.\" Then a subsequent statute (5 & 6 Viet., c. 98, s. 18), after enact ing that the expense of conveyance, safe custody, &c, of prisoners for offences arising within the borough, sent by the borough quarter sessions to the county gaol, when there is no contract subsisting between such borough and county relative to such prisoners, shall be paid by the council of the borough, proceeds to provide that the expenses of prosecuting such prisoners shall be defrayed by the treasurer of the borough, in the manner directed in the above section, by a rate to be levied for that purpose. The Act further provides \u2014 \" That the treasurer of every county in England and Wales shall keep an account of all costs arising out of the prosecution, maintenance and punishment, conveyance and transport of all offenders committed for trial to the assizes in such county from any borough in which a separate court of quarter sessions of the peace shall be holden ; and the treasurer of every such county shall, not more than twice in every year, send a copy of the said account to the council of each of the said boroughs, and shall make an order for payment of the same on the council of such borough ; and the council of every such borough shall forthwith order the same, with all reasonable charges of making and sending such account, to be paid by the treasurer of such county out of the borough fund ; and in case any difference shall arise concerning the said account, it shall be decided by the arbitration of a barrister to be named, as is provided in the"], [173, "THEIR GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT. 155 case of differences with respect to the payment of moneys under contracts made by authority of an Act made in the fifth year of His late Majesty George IV., intituled ' An Act for amending an Act of the last Session of Parliament, relat ing to the building, repairing, and enlarging of certain Gaols and Houses of Correction, and for procuring information as to the state of all other Gaols and Houses of Correction in England and Wales : ' provided that nothing herein contained shall be construed to alter or restrain the powers given by the last mentioned Act of contracting with the justices of the peace, having authority or jurisdiction in and over any gaol or house of correction of the county wherein or where such borough is situated, or whereto it is adjacent, for the conveyance, support or maintenance in such last mentioned gaol or house of correction of persons committed thereto from such borough, save only that all such powers shall, after the first of May, 1836, be vested in the council of such borough in the name of the body corporate, whose council they are, and in none other; and for the purpose of making such contracts as aforesaid, the council of such borough, and none other, shall have power to make the orders required by the said last mentioned Act to be made by the justices of the borough at the borough sessions.\"* The expenses to be charged on a borough having separate quarter sessions are to be estimated upon a calculation of the proportion which the expense of each prisoner bears to the total expenses of the gaol, and are not to be limited to the direct expenses incurred in respect of the individual prisoner. The council may contract for committing prisoners to the gaol of another borough, if there be sufficient accommodation, &c, in it, and the county justices may contract with the council of a borough in which there is a sufficient gaol for the committal of county prisoners thither.* Lastly, it is enacted \u2014 \" That the treasurer of every county in England and Wales shall keep an account of all sums of money received in aid or on account of the county rate, and of the sums of money expended out of the county rate for other purposes than the costs arising out of the prosecution, maintenance and punishment, con- veyance and transport of offenders committed for trial in such county, and in the case of boroughs having a separate court of quarter sessions of the peace other than that of coroner's inquests, and shall, not more than twice in every year, send a copy of the said account to the council of every borough situate within such county in which a separate court of quarter sessions of the peace shall be holden, and which, before the passing of the said Act, intituled ' An Act to settle and describe the Divisions of Counties, and the Limits of Cities and Boroughs, in England and Wales, so far as respects the election of Members to serve in Parlia- ment,' was chargeable with, or liable to contribute in whole, or in part to, the county rate of such county, and shall make an order oh the council of every such borough for the payment of such proportion of such sum as would have been chargeable, after deducting all sums of money received in aid of the county * These provisionsof the Act of 1835 have, however, undergone material alteration by subsequent legislation, and especially by the Prisons Act, 1877."], [174, "156 ENGLISH MUNICIPAL INSTITUTIONS; rates as aforesaid, if this Act had not passed, upon such boroughs, as the same shall be bounded, according to the provisions of this Act ; and the council of such borough shall forthwith order the same, with all reasonable charges of making and sending the said account, to be paid to the treasurer of such county out of the borough fund : Provided that in case any difference shall arise con cerning the last mentioned account, it shall be decided by the arbitration of a barrister to be named, as is provided in the case of differences with respect to the payment of moneys under contracts made by the authority of the said Act (5 Geo. IV., c. 85).\" As to jurors the Act provides that every burgess of a borough wherein there is a separate court of quarter sessions of the peace or a court of record for the trial of civil actions (unless he be exempt or disqualified from serving on a jury otherwise than in respect of property under 6 Geo. IV., c. 50)* is qualified and liable to serve on grand and petty juries in such borough both at the quarter sessions and in the court of record. The clerk of the peace is to give ten days' public notice at least of the holding of the court of quarter sessions, and is at least seven days before to summon a sufficient number of grand jurors. The clerk of the peace and the registrar of the court of record are respectively to summon not less than thirty-six nor more than sixty persons to serve as petty jurors at the court of quarter sessions, or as jurors in the court of record (in case there is any cause to be tried at the sitting of the last mentioned court). In case a juror duly summoned does not attend in pursuance of his summons, the court is empowered (unless some reasonable * The persons disqualified under this Act from serving on juries are the following : \u2014 Aliens, unless the jury be de medietate lingu\u00e6 ; persons attainted of treason or felony, or of any crime that is infamous, unless they have obtained a pardon ; persons outlawed or excommunicated; and women, unless on a writ de ventre insspieiendo (this liability is proposed to be abolished by the Criminal Code Bill). Those who are merely exempted from serving on juries may be classed under the following heads \u2014 viz., peers ; judges of the courts of record at Westminster ; clergymen in holy orders; qualified Roman Catholic clergymen; qualified Protestant dissenting clergy men ; serjeants, and barristers-at-law actually practising ; doctors and advocates of the civil law actually practising; attorneys and proctors duly admitted and actually practising in the courts of law or equity, or in the ecclesiastical or Admiralty courts, who have taken out their annual certificates; officers in any of these courts actually executing the duties of their offices; coroners, gaolers, and keepers of houses of correction; members and licentiates of the Royal College of Physicians in London actually practising; surgeons who are members of one of the Royal Colleges of Surgeons, in London, Edinburgh, or Dublin, and aotually practising; apothecaries certificated by the court of examiners of the Apothecaries' Company, and actually practising ; officers of the army and navy on full pay ; pilots licensed by the Trinity House of Deptford, Hull, or Newcastle ; masters of ships in the buoy and light service ; and pilots licensed by the lord warden of the Cinque Ports, or under any Act of Parliament or charter in any other port: the household servants of Her Majesty; officers of the customs or excise ; sheriffs' officers ; high constables and parish clerks."], [175, "157 THEIR GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT. excuse be proved) to impose upon him such fine as it shall think fit. This fine, unless duly paid, may be levied by order of the court by distress and sale of the juror's goods, the amount being paid over to the borough fund. No person is to be summoned to serve as a juror at the sessions or at the court of record oftener than once a year, unless* all persons liable to serve have been summoned once during the year. Members of the council, justices of the peace for any borough, and the treasurer and the town clerk thereof, are exempt and disqualified from serving on any jury within the borough, and are exempt from serving on any jury in the county in which such borough is situated. Burgesses of boroughs which have a court of quarter sessions are also exempt from serving at county quarter sessions. All chartered exemptions from serving on juries in any borough are, however, abolished. With respect to borough courts for the trial of civil actions, the Act provides in substance that these courts, whether existing by virtue of charter or custom, should continue to be holden as before, and that the council should have power to appoint the judge. The alterations made were confined to a few minor particulars, chiefly required to carry out the purposes of the statute. These courts have authority to try actions of assumpsit, covenant, and debt, whether the debt be by speciality or on simple contract ; and all actions of trespass or trover for taking goods and chattels, provided the sum or damages sought to be recovered does not exceed \u00a320 ; and all actions of ejectment between landlord and tenant wherein the annual rent of the premises of which possession is sought to be recovered does not exceed \u00a320, and upon which no fine has been reserved or made payable. They cannot, however, try any action wherein the title to land, whether freehold, copyhold, or leasehold, or to any title, toll, market, fair, or other franchise is in question, unless they had authority to do so before the passing of the Municipal Corporations Act. The council are to appoint the registrar of such court, except when the town clerk acts in that capacity, and such other officers and servants as are necessary for carrying on the business and executing the proceedings of the court. No registrar or other officer of the court is by himself or any partner, or by his or their clerks, to practise as an attorney in such court.-, It was anticipated at the time of the passing of the Act of 1835 that there would be a revival of the * See 7 Will. IV., and 1 Vic., c. 78, s. 36. t With respect to the practice of these courts of record, the result of the several enactments which have from time to time been passed on the subject seems to be that every judge of such court may from time to time make, alter, and revoke such rules"], [176, "158 ENGLISH MUNICIPAL INSTITUTIONS; civil courts and jurisdictions then in abeyance, but the establishment of new county courts by the 9 & 10 Viet. c. 95 (with their inexpensive procedure and the extensive powers conferred on them by recent Acts) have almost completely annulled the various jurisdictions detailed at page 151. Only eighteen out of the 178 cities and boroughs scheduled in the Act of 1835 are now included in the annual Judicial Returns with respect to their civil jurisdiction, and of that number not more than a dozen (vide Table 2 of this Section) can be said to have a publicly-recognised existence. At unfrequent in tervals a suit is entered in the civil court of one or other of the boroughs not set out in the Judicial Returns ; but so seldom does this occur, that the fact is hardly known outside the precincts of the court. The few tribunals which can boast an uninterrupted practice since 1835 have in a certain measure been reconstituted, and raised from the state of inefficiency and disorder into which they had fallen previous to that year, with the result of their now enjoying a deserved popularity with btigants such as distinguishes the Mayors' Court of London. By the Municipal Corporations Act the council of every borough are authorised and empowered to settle and from time to timo to alter (subject in each case to the confirmation of one of the secre taries of state) a table of the fees to be taken by the clerk of the peace, the magistrates' clerk, and the registrar of the court of record ; and the town clerk is to cause a true copy of this table to be hung up in a conspicuous part of the room in which the business of his office is transacted, in the room where the borough justices sit for transacting their business, and in the rooms respectively in which the court of quarter sessions and the court of record are held. When by any Act any penalties or forfeitures are or shall hereafter be made recoverable in a summary manner before any justice or justices of the peace, and by such Acts respectively the for appointing the times for holding such court (provided that it shall be held for the trial of issue of fact and of law four times in each year, and with no greater interval between the holding of any two successive courts than four calendar months), sol regulating the forms and manner cf proceeding, the process, appearance, practice, and pleading in such courts, and for settling the reasonable fees of the attorneys of the court for business transacted therein, with a view to conducting the business of the court with most couvenience and at the smallest reasonable expense ; such rules, or any order revoking or altering such rules, only to be in force upon being allowed and confirmed by three of the judges of the superior courts at Westminster. It would also seem that these enactments have been construed by the judges to give the power of granting new trials, although it had formerly been held that this court could not give a new trial, and indeed had been laid down generally that inferior courts could not grant a new trial on the merits. (See Grant on Corporations, page 461.)"], [177, "THEIR GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT. 159 same shall be limited and made payable to His Majesty, or to any body corporate, or to any person whomsoever, save and except the informer who shall sue for the same, or any party aggrieved, then in every such case such penalties, if recovered before a justice of a borough in which a court of quarter sessions is holden, shall, notwithstanding anything contained in such Acts, be paid to the borough treasurer on account of the borough fund. This enactment, however, does not extend to penalties or forfeitures recovered under any Act relating to the customs, excise, or post-office, or to trade or navigation, or any branch of the revenue. These must be appro priated to the purposes, or paid over to the person or institution, named in the Act under which they are imposed. Prosecutions for all offences punishable by summary conviction under the Act of 1835 must be commenced within three calendar months after the commission of the offence, and not otherwise. The borough justices are empowered to summon witnesses to give evidence touching any offence against the Act ; and if such witnesses do not attend, they may be fined in a sum not exceeding \u00a35. No person is incompetent as a witness because he is liable to be rated to the borough rate. Penalties are to be made payable either imme- diately or within such period as the justices think fit. If not paid, they are to be levied by distress upon the goods and chattels of the offender ; and if no sufficient distress be found, he is to be imprisoned in the house of correction for any term not exceeding one calendar month when the penalty does not exceed \u00a35, and for any term not exceeding two calendar months in any other case ; the imprisonment to cease in each case upon payment of the sum due. Any person who feels aggrieved by a summary conviction under the Act may appeal to the next court of general or quarter sessions of the peace to be holden not less than twelve days after such conviction for the county or the borough wherein the cause of complaint shall have arisen. Written notice of the appeal must, however, be given to the complainant within three days after conviction, and seven clear days at least before such sessions. No conviction, order, warrant, or other matter, made or purporting to be made by virtue of the Municipal Corporations Act, is to be quashed for want of form, or be removed by certiorari, or otherwise, into any of the superior courts at Westminster. Provision is also made for preventing any warrant of commitment, or any proceedings for levying a distress, being rendered invalid on the ground of informality. The civil duties discharged by a court of County Quarter Sessions (such as sanitary, police, highway regulations, &c.,) are thrown upon"], [178, "160 ENGLISH MUNICIPAL INSTITUTIONS ; the council in boroughs where a separate police force is maintained, or where the council act as the sanitary authority. The Act 7 William IV. & 1 Victoria, c. 19, enacts that whenever it appears to the recorder or other person presiding at quarter sessions that they are likely to last more than three days, he is authorised to form a second court and appoint a barrister of not less than five years' standing to preside therein. But this power is not to be exercised unless it has been previously certified to the recorder under the hand or hands of the mayor or two of the aldermen that the council have resolved that it is expedient this should be done, nor unless the name of the barrister so appointed shall have been previously submitted to and approved by the secretary of state. Such assistant barrister is to have ten guineas a day while he thus presides in the second court ; the assistant clerk of the peace and assistant crier (who are also to be appointed) are to have respectively two guineas and half a guinea per diem ; but none of them are to be entitled to claim remuneration for more than two days * The Act 2 & 3 Victoria, c. 27, enabled the judges of courts of re cord in boroughs to make rules as to the times of holding, and forms of practice in such courts. These rules are not, however, to be of any force until they have been confirmed by three judges of the superior courts ; nor are they to provide for holding the said courts of record seldomer than four times a year. The Act 12 & 13 Victoria, c. 18, which is intituled An Act for the holding of petty sessions of the peace in boroughs, and for providing places in counties and boroughs,' provides that every sitting and acting of justices of the peace, or of a stipendiary magistrate in and for any city, borough, or corporate town, having a separate com mission of the peace, at any police court, or other place appointed in that behalf, shall be deemed a petty sessions of the peace, and the district within which the same shall be holden shall be deemed a petty sessional division within the meaning of any Acts of Parlia ment having relation to such petty sessions, or to any business to be transacted thereat. The councils of boroughs are authorised to provide places for holding petty sessions, or to agree for the use of the county court for this purpose. The Act 13 & 14 Victoria, c. 91, provides that the justices of any borough which has its own gaol or house of correction may commit for safe custody to such gaol or house of correction for trial at the assizes to be holden for the county in which such city or borough * But see 40 and 41 Viet., c. 17 (page 162), which extends the period to four days."], [179, "THEIR GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT. 161 may be situated any person charged before them with any offence, except murder, committed within the limits of such city or borough triable at such assizes. Persons charged with murder must still be committed to the county gaol. Aud prisoners committed to the borough gaol must be removed to the county gaol previous to their trial. The expenses of such prisoners so removed to the county gaol are to be calculated as provided by 5 & 6 Viet., c. 98. In cases of conviction at the assizes for offences committed within the limits of a city or borough maintaining its own gaol, the court may commit the offender to such gaol for the execution of his sentence. This Act also contains a provision giving the borough justices the same juris diction, with respect to all offences committed and matters arising within the borough, as the justices of the county in which such city or borough is situate have under or by virtue of any local or general Act of Parliament.* The Act 31 & 32 Victoria, c. 22 s. 3, enacts that local authority means \u2014 in any county, ports, liberty or division of county having a separate commission ofthe peace, the justices in quarter sessions assembled ; in any borough having a separate commission of the peace, the council of the borough. The fourth section provides that two or more local authorities may, with the approval of one of Her Majesty's principal secretaries of state, contract that a place for the holding of petty sessions by each of such authorities shall be provided at the joint expense of such authorities in such manner and proportions as in the said contract mentioned. By s. 5, when any local authority is in possession of a convenient building for holding petty sessions, or for transacting business authorised by any Act of Parliament to be per formed by justices out of petty sessions, any neighbouring local authority may contract with such former authority for the use by themselves of such building for such purposes, or any of them, and may use the same accordingly. Section 6 gives power to local authorities to contract for lock-up houses. By s. 7, contracts may include cost of conveyance. Section 8 directs petty sessional houses and lock-ups to be deemed within the jurisdiction of contracting local authorities. By s. 9, expenses are to be raised and defrayed as if they had been incurred in relation to the subject matter of such con tracts by and within the jurisdiction of the authority which has con tracted to pay the same. Section 11 empowers a local authority to form a committee of its own members and others in order to carry out the provisions of the Act. * The Prisons Act, 1877, varies, to a certain extent, the procedure under the provisions of this Act. M"], [180, "162 ENGLISH MUNICIPAL INSTITUTIONS J The Act 35 & 36 Victoria, c. 86, empowers Her Majesty from time to time by an order in council to direct all or any part of the pro visions of an Act passed in the first and second years of His late Majesty King William the Fourth, intituled 'An Act to enable courts of law to give relief against adverse claims made upon persons having no interest in the subject of such claims,' and of certain pro visions set forth in the schedule to this Act, shall apply to all or any local court or Courts of Record in England or Wales.

The Police and Criminal Statistics. The police organization of the corporate towns, previous to 1835, was in the most deplorable condition. Few of the corporations had under their direction other than the leet constables, and where a police worthy of the name did exist, it was invariably under the control of an independent body, acting in avowed rivalry with the undisciplined corporate officials, and owing its authority to local Acts of Parliament. In some towns the evils resulting from the want of a well organized system were attempted, unsuccessfully, to be obviated by the appointment of privately-paid watchmen. Generally speaking, the municipal police may be said to have been wretchedly insufficient and ineffective. The almost unexceptional absence of uniformity in the ancient police arrangements, and the non-existence of criminal statistics for so early a date as 1835, render a tabular comparison of any value, in this Section, out of the question. The character of the old police organiza tions of such of the cities and boroughs as are now governed under the Act of 1835, are therefore set out in a separate form, as follows : \u2014 Cities and Boeoughs.

The committee is from time to time to appoint a sufficient number of constables for the borough, who shall not only within such borough, but also within the county in which such borough or part thereof is situated, and also within every county being within seven miles of any such borough, and within all liberties in any such county, have all such powers and privileges, and be liable to all such duties and responsibilities, as any constable duly appointed had at the time of the passing of the Municipal Corporations Act, or thereafter might have, within his con stable wick by virtue of the common law, or of any statutes made or to be made, and shall obey all such commands as they may from time to time receive from any of the justices of the peace having jurisdiction within such borough, or within any county in which they shall be called on to act as constables. The watch committee are empowered to make regulations for the management of the constables, who are empowered while on duty to apprehend all idle and disorderly persons whom they find disturbing the public peace, or whom they have just cause to suspect Cities and Boeoughs.

Constables attending at the watch houses in the night may take bail by recognizances from persons brought before them for petty misdemeanours, such recognizances to be conditional for the appearance of the parties before a magistrate, and the recognizances to be forfeited if the parties do not duly appear. If a constable of any borough is guilty of neglect of duty or disobedience of any lawful order, he is liable, on conviction before any two justices of the peace, to be imprisoned for any time not exceeding ten days, or to be fined not exceeding 40s., or to be dismissed from his office, as the justices shall think fit. Persons assaulting constables in the execution of their duty are rendered liable to a fine not exceeding \u00a35. The watch committee are authorised to fix the pay of the constables, to defray their expenses in apprehending offenders, to reward them for activity in the discharge of their duties, to compensate them for injuries received in the performance of their duties, or to make an allowance to such as shall be disabled by bodily injury or worn out by length of service.* The magistrates having jurisdiction within any borough are also authorised and required to appoint a number of persons to act as special constables. The watch committee are required to transmit a report on the 1st of January, 1st of April, 1st of July, and 1st of October, in every year, to one of the secretaries of state (the Home Secretary), the number of men appointed to act as constables or policemen in such borough ; and of the description of arms, accoutrements and clothing, and other necessaries furnished to each man ; and of the salaries, wages, and allowances payable to such constables or policemen ; and of the number and situation of all station houses in such borough; and also a copy of all rules, orders, and regulations which shall from time to time be made by such watch committee, or by the council of such borough, for the regulation and guidance of such constables or policemen. Power is given to the council to order parts of a borough not within a local Act as to lighting to be included in such Act ; and the council are also authorised to assume the powers of inspectors, under 3 & 4 William IV. c. 90, for lighting any part of the borough. The Act, however, is not to interfere with the regulations for the government, &c, of dockyards, arsenals, &c. It also provided that in every case in which, before the 9th September, 1835, any rate might be levied in any borough, or in any parish or place made part of a borough, by that Act, for the purpose of watching by day or by night conjointly with any other purpose, it should be lawful for the council to levy a watch rate sufficient to raise any sum of money not greater than the average * As to police superannuation and matters incidental thereto, see 22 & 23 Viet., c. 32 (1859), and 28 & 29 Viet., c. 35 (1865)."], [211, "THEIR GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT. 193 yearly sum which, during the previous seven years (or when any such rate should not have been levied during seven years, then during such less number of years as such rate had been levied), had been expended in the maintenance and establishment of watchmen, constables, patrol, or policemen, within the district in which such rate was levied. It having, however, been found that the amount of watch rate leviable under these powers was in many cases insufficient, the legislature subsequently, by the 2 & 3 Viet. c. 28, empowered the council of every borough named in the schedules of the Municipal Corporations Act to levy a watch rate on \" The occupiers of all messuages, lands, tenements, and hereditaments within those parts of the borough which shall be watched by day and by night, and which from time to time, by any order of the council, shall be declared liable to such watch rate ; and every such rate shall be made upon an estimate of the net annual value of the several hereditaments rated thereto, that is to say, of the rent at which one year with another the same might in their actual state be reasonably expected to let from year to year ; the probable annual average cost of the repairs, insurances, and other expenses, if any, necessary to maintain the hereditaments in their actual state, and all rates, taxes, and public charges, except tithes or tithe commutation rent charges, if any, being paid by the tenant, and either by one rate made yearly, or by two or more rates made half-yearly, or otherwise.\" The amount of such watch rate is to be at the discretion of the council, but is not to exceed in any one year the sum of 6a7. in the pound. But, by the 3 & 4 Viet. c. 28, it was provided that the Act last quoted should not apply to any borough in which the borough fund was sufficient, with the aid only of the amount of watch rate which could be raised under the Municipal Corporations Act, and without the aid of any borough rate, to defray the expense of the constabulary force of the borough, together with all the other expenses legally payable out of the borough fund by virtue of the said Muni- cipal Corporations Act, or any other Act or Acts of Parliament. There are one or two subsequent enactments relating to the better collecting of watch rates, but they are not of such an important character as to require more than a passing notice. Some important provisions of the Municipal Corporations Act which indirectly apply to the borough police establishments are quoted in the introductions to Sections 6 and 7 of this Part.* The Police Acts passed subsequent to 1835 have always encouraged a consolidation of the police forces of the boroughs with those of the counties in which they are situated. The County Police Act of 1840 (3 & 4 Victoria, c. 88) enables a municipal borough to agree with the county authority for consolidation on the terms that the county chief constable shall have the control and dismissal of the borough * Seepages 127 and 149. 0"], [212, "194 ENGLISH MUNICIPAL INSTITUTIONS ; police. By the County and Borough Police Act of 1856 (19 & 20 Victoria, c. 69) it is enacted that such an agreement cannot be termi- nated without the consent of the Secretary of State, and that a borough with not more than 5,000 population shall not receive any Treasury subvention unless it has so consolidated ; the terms of consolidation may be imposed on a county by an order in council. The County and Borough Police Act of 1859 (22 & 23 Victoria, c. 32) enacts a variety of regulations affecting the internal and external control of the police establishments. The repeated recommendations of the Inspectors of Constabulary in recent years upon the desirability of a much larger measure of consolidation than has taken place under the Acts just mentioned, have been couched in strong and emphatic language, with the result that the new Charters Act (40 & 41 Victoria, c. 69, s. 8) prohibits the establishment in a borough to which a charter is granted under the Act, of \" a new separate police not consolidated with the county police, unless the district incorporated by such charter contained not fewer than twenty thousand (20,000) inhabitants, according to the census taken next before the date of such incorporation.\" Tables 2 and 3 in this Section have been compiled from the latest Reports of the Inspectors of Constabulary and information supplied by the local officials of each city and borough.

The Municipal Commissioners reported, in 1835, upon the subject of Municipal Finances, that many of the Corporations possessed considerable revenues, derived from various sources; from lands, leases of tithes, and other property; from tolls of markets and fairs ; from duties or tolls imposed on the import or export of goods and merchandise ; from quay and anchorage dues, &c. ; and from fees payable on the admission of officers and burgesses, as well as from fines imposed on persons refusing to perform the duties of corporate offices. The application of the corporate revenues under the old adminis tration was found, in a majority of cases, to be but little actuated by a concern for public requirements or advantages. In numerous instances the corporate income was secretly diverted from its legitimate use and wastefully bestowed for the benefit of individuals ; sometimes it was openly squandered for purposes injurious to the character and morals of the people. In the 64th paragraph of their report, the Commissioners observed that \u2014 \" In many of the Corporations the revenues are sufficient for the maintenance of all necessary municipal institutions. In many, although amply sufficient for supporting the various purposes for which municipalities were instituted, they are but partially applied to them. In most, however, the revenues would be inadequate to these purposes, though they should be entirely expended upon them. In several boroughs a rate is levied upon the inhabitants in the nature of a county rate. There are many instances among the boroughs returning members to Parliament, in which the revenues are inadequate to the wants of the munici pality, and in which the deficiency has been supplied either from the funds of the patron, or by the members for the borough. In some, before the passing of the Reform Act (1832), the members for the borough or the patron paid all the municipal expenses. Since that epoch these contributions have ceased, and such corporations have no longer the means of maintaining municipal institutions of any kind.\" The \"common\" or \"pasture\" rights of the freemen of many of the corporate towns were of the most extensive character. Some times the land was farmed out and the profits divided amongst the freemen; at Berwick-upon-Tweed the freemen administered their own proprietary affairs, and the value of their profits amounted to nearly \u00a36,000 per annum. The Table at pages 49 and 50 shows the nature of the proprietary rights of the burgesses in several of the cities and boroughs now amenable to the Municipal Corporations Act. In not a few cases the governing bodies were the uncontrolled trustees of property vested in them for exclusively charitable purposes ; sometimes estates were held upon the responsibility of maintaining public works and supporting specific objects for the welfare of the"], [218, "200 ENGLISH MUNICIPAL INSTITUTIONS ; burgesses. But it cannot be said that the last-named obligations were very often acknowledged. Upon these points the Commis sioners remarked : \u2014 \" Some corporations consider that their property has been vested in them solely as trustees for the public ; but in most cases this truth is acknowledged only when forced on their attention, is received with difficulty and qualification, and is continually forgotten. Few corporations admit any positive obligation to expend the surplus of their income for objects of public advantage. Such expenditure is regarded as a spontaneou4*act of private generosity, rather than a well-considered application of the public revenue. * * * From this erroneous but strongly rooted opinion that the property of the corporation is held in trust for the benefit of the corporate body only, distinguishing that body from the community with which it is locally connected, the transition is not difficult to the opinion that individual corporations may justifiably derive a personal benefit from that property. At Cambridge, the practice of turning the corporation property to the profit of individuals, was avowed and defended by a member of the council.\" The indebtedness of many of the corporations was extremely heavy, and generally brought about by negligent and questionable management. The patrons of the small and \" close \" boroughs fre quently held mortgages of the whole of the corporate property as security for monetary advances ; and in many places such a large proportion of the revenue was absorbed by way of interest, that the corporation had to declare itself absolutely insolvent. With such ideas as these in the ascendant, combined with a reckless extravagance of outlay in every branch of the corporate service, it is not to be wondered at that the local taxation, by which the permanent income was supplemented, was widely felt to be an intolerable and unjust burden. The main provision relating to Municipal Finance in the Municipal Corporations Act is contained in the 92nd section, which in substance enacts that the rents and profits of all hereditaments, and the interest, dividends, and annual proceeds of all moneys, dues, chattels, and valuable securities, belonging or payable to any body corporate named in conjunction with the boroughs in the schedule to the Act, or to any member or officer thereof in his corporate capacity, and every fine or penalty for every offence against the Act (the applica tion of which is not otherwise provided for) shall be paid to the treasurer of such borough. All the moneys which he so receives are to be by him carried to the account of a fund to be called \" The Borough Fund,\" and such fund \u2014 subject to the payment of any lawful debt due from such body corporate to any person, which shall have been contracted before 9th September, 1835, and unredeemed, or of so much thereof as the council from time to time shall be required, or shall deem it expedient to redeem ; and to the payment,"], [219, "THEIR GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT. 201 from time to time, of the interest of so much thereof as shall remain unredeemed; and saving all rights, interests, claims, or demands of all persons or bodies corporate in or upon the real or personal estate of any body corporate, by virtue of any pro- ceedings either at law or in equity which have been already instituted or which may be hereafter instituted, or by virtue of any mortgage or otherwise\u2014 shall be applied towards the payment of the salary of the mayor, of the recorder, and of the police magistrate (when there is a recorder or police magistrate), and of the respective salaries of the town clerk and treasurer, and of every other officer whom the council shall appoint ; and also towards the payment of the expenses incurred from time to time in preparing and printing burgess lists, and lists, and notices, and other matters attending such elections as are mentioned in the Act; and in boroughs which have a separate court of sessions of the peace, towards the prosecution of offenders, towards the expense of main- taining the borough gaol, house of correction, and corporate buildings, and of all other expenses not specially provided for, which are necessarily incurred in carrying into effect the provisions of the Act. The corporate property being thus charged with all expenses of carrying into effect the Municipal Corporations Act, two cases immediately arise \u2014 first, where there is a surplus in the borough fund, after all the ordinary payments of salaries and other fixed burthens upon the fund have been met; and second, where the amount of the borough fund is not adequate to the claims upon it. Now: \u2014 1. In the first place, it is provided that in case the borough fund be more than sufficient for the purposes above mentioned, the surplus is to be applied, under the direction of the council, for the public benefit of the inhabitants and improvement of the borough. It has been held, for instance, that the council may devote this surplus to the defence of proceedings on informations, having for their object the destruction of the corporation, although they may be directed against individuals. But it must clearly appear to the Court that the money has been applied for public purposes ;* therefore the surplus cannot be applied to defend a quo warranto information against an individual whose own interests only were concerned ; nor * Section 44 of 7 Will. IV. and 1 Viet. c. 78 enacts that any order of the council of any borough for the payment of money out of the Borough Fund may be remove into the Court of Queen's Bench by writ of certiorari, and may then be disallowed or confirmed by the Court. The Court, however, is not obliged under the section to disallow payments actually made, even although the charges be so far irregular that payment could not have been enforced."], [220, "202 ENGLISH MUNICIPAL INSTITUTIONS J can the surplus be properly applied in defending a criminal informa tion against a person for misdemeanours in his office of alderman ; for it can never be the interest of the borough that a person who has committed a delinquency should not be punished. Nor will one party in the corporation be permitted to fight the other by means of legal proceedings defrayed with the corporation money. And the public purposes to which the surplus may be applied are those of the borough and not of the public at large. Several Acts have specified objects on which it may be expended. As to the establish ment in boroughs of baths and washhouses, see 9 & 10 Viet. c. 74, and 41 & 42 Viet. c. 14; as to lunatic asylums for boroughs, see 16 & 17 Viet. c. 97 ; as to the establishment of libraries and museums, see 18 & 19 Viet. c. 70; of institutions for the promotion of literature, science, and the fine arts, see 17 & 18 Viet. c. 112 ; and as to the adoption and repair of highways by the council, see 25 & 26 Viet. c. 61. t 2. If the borough fund be not sufficient for the purposes to which it is primarily applicable, then the corporation are authorised and required from time to time to estimate as correctly as may be what amount in addition to such fund will be sufficient for the payment of the expenses to be incurred in carrying into effect the provisions of the Municipal Corporations Act ; and in order to raise the amount so estimated, the council is authorised and required from time to time to levy a borough rate within the borough. For this purpose they are invested with all the powers, so far as they are applicable, given to the justices at quarter sessions by the 55 Geo. III. c. 51, with respect to the county rate. All warrants required by that Act to be issued under the hands and seals of two or more justices, are in the case of the borough rate to be signed by the mayor and sealed with the common seal. An appeal against the rate lies to the recorder sitting in quarter sessions. The council being thus authorised to levy a borough rate in order to meet any deficiency of the borough fund, it is no excuse for the non-payment of a debt justly chargeable on that fund that it will not suffice to pay the amount without a borough rate. But in general a borough rate will be bad if it be retrospective, as in that case succeeding inhabitants would have to pay for services, &c, of which their predecessors had enjoyed the whole benefit. The treasurer of every corporation is to keep a true account of all sums of money received and paid ; and the books containing such t See also page 14 for enumeration of other objects of public utility, &c, upon which a corporation may expend."], [221, "THEIR GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT. 203 accounts are at all times to be open to the inspection of any of the aldermen or councillors of such borough ; and all the vouchers relating thereto are, in the months of March and September in every year, to be submitted by the treasurer of the borough to the auditors elected by the burgesses, and to such member of the council as the mayor may name, for the purpose of being examined and audited for the previous half year. If the accounts are found correct, the auditors are to sign them. And after the September audit the treasurer is to make out in writing and cause to be printed a full abstract of his accounts for the year. A copy of this document is to be open to the inspection of all ratepayers of the borough, to whom also copies are to be supplied on payment of a reasonable price. With respect to the real property of the corporation, it is provided by s. 94 ofthe Act, that except in the cases thereinafter mentioned, or in pursuance of contracts entered into before June 5, 1835, it shall not be lawful for the council of a borough to sell or mortgage their lands and hereditaments, or to lease them for any longer term than thirty-one years. In every lease granted by the corporation there shall, moreover (except as hereinafter mentioned), be reserved and made payable during the whole of the term granted such clear yearly rent as to the council may appear reasonable, without taking any fine for the same. As, however, it may sometimes be expedient that the stringency of these restrictions should be relaxed, the council are in such cases authorised to apply to the Lords of the Treasury, who will consider the circumstances ; and with their approbation, or with the approbation of any three of them, * it will be lawful for the corpo ration to sell, alienate, and demise [or to ' mortgage,' vide 6 & 7 Will. IV. c. 104, s. 2] any of their lands, tenements, and hereditaments in such a manner and on such terms as have been approved by the said lords commissioners. Before, however, any application is made to the Treasury, notice of the intention of the council to make such application must be fixed to the outer door of the town hall, or in some public and conspicuous place within the borough, one calendar month at least before such application. A copy of the memorial intended to be sent to the Treasury must also be kept in the town clerk's office during such calendar month, and must be open to the inspection of every burgess at all reasonable hours during that time. There are, however, two cases in which a corporation may, without * The consent or appToval of the Lords of the Treasury is sufficiently signified by a letter from their secretary. They can give no consent to any alienation or change of the corporate property further than such as is specified in the memorial presented to them."], [222, "204 ENGLISH MUNICIPAL INSTITUTIONS. the previous consent of the Lords of the Treasury, grant leases for other or longer terms than thirty-one years. In all cases in which, before the passing of the Municipal Corpo rations Act, it had been the ancient custom of the corporation to grant and renew leases for lives or for years determinable on lives, &c, at a fine certain, or under any special or specific terms or con ditions, &c, it is still lawful for the council to renew such leases on the terms on which they were held before. It is also lawful for the corporation to lease for any term not exceeding twenty-five years [' either at a reserved rent or fine or both, as the council shall think fit,' vide 6 & 7 Will. IV. c. 104, s. 2] tenements or hereditaments, the greater part of the yearly value of which consists of any building or buildings, or land or ground proper for the erection of any houses or other buildings, and where the lessee covenants or agrees to erect a building or buildings thereon of greater yearly value than such land or ground, or of land or ground proper for gardens, yards, curtilages, or other appurtenances to be used with any other house or other building erected or to be erected on any such ground, belonging either to such body corporate or to any other proprietor, or proper for any other purpose calculated to afford convenience or accommodation to the occupiers of such house or building. It only remains to notice one other provision which affected the corporate property at the time the Act was passed. Municipal Corporations were then extensive holders of ecclesiastical patronage. It was, however, thought very desirable that this should not continue to be the case, and it was accordingly enacted that in cases where corporate bodies were seized in their corporate capacity and not as charitable trustees of any advowson, or right of nomination or presentation to any benefice, either appendant or in gross, every such advowson and right of presentation should be sold at such time and in such manner as the Ecclesiastical Commissioners might direct, and that the proceeds of such sale should be paid to the treasurer of the borough, and should be by him invested in Government securities for the use of the body corporate, the annual interest payable thereon being carried to the account of the borough fund, t The annexed Table shews, in alphabetical order of subjects, the various purposes for which a Municipal Corporation is empowered to borrow money under public general Acts, but very large powers of borrowing have from time to time been authorised by Parliament for special and pressing reasons by means of local Acts. f The 6 & 7 Will.

The Act 7 Will. IV. & 1 Victoria, c. 81, intituled \" An Act to provide for the levying of Bates in Boroughs and Towns having Municipal Corporations in England and Wales,\" has its effect clearly and succinctly explained in the following notes : \u2014 \" This Act was passed in consequence of the Municipal Corporations Act, 5 & 6 Will. IV. cap. 76, having omitted (in s. 92) to extend to borough rates some of the provisions of the 55 Geo. III. cap. 51, respecting county rates. By the twelfth section of this last-mentioned Act (now repealed by 15 and 16 Viet. cap. 81), three distinct powers were given. First, the power in the justices in sessions to make the rate, and to issue warrants for its collection by the high constable ; secondly, the power given to the justices out of sessions to issue a warrant for the levy of the rate upon the goods of any overseer, &c, refusing to pay the assessment to the high constable ; and, thirdly, the power to the overseers, or persons appointed to act as such, to levy by rate the sums assessed, or to reimburse themselves by a special rate such sums as they shall have paid on account of the county rate. But the ninety-second section of the Municipal Corpo rations Act, though it gives the same powers to the council to make * See also 23 & 24 Viet., c. 51 ; 34 & 35 Viet., c. 70 ; and 40 & 41 Viet., c. 66. The last-named Act directs that the annual abstract of accounts shall be made up to the 25th March in each year, with power to the Local Government Board to temporarily vary the date. t See \" Rawlinson's Municipal Corporations Act\" (Webby)."], [225, "THEIR GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT. 207 the rate, and confers upon the mayor the power of levying by distress the assessment upon the overseers and other collectors of rates, makes no express provision authorising the overseers of the poor to pay such assessment out of the poor rates, or to make any special rate to reim burse themselves the amount paid over to the borough rate; and doubts having arisen whether, in the absence of such express provision, the overseers would be justified in so applying the rates in their hands, or in levying a special rate to reimburse themselves according to the provisions of the County Rate Act, this statute was passed, the first section of which authorised the council to order the overseers to pay the assessment of the borough rate out of the poor rate, or to make and collect a, pound rate for the purpose. And then, inasmuch as this provision would not apply to extra-parochial places, or to parishes and townships partly within and partly without the borough, the third section expressly provided for such cases, and thus the borough rate and county rate appeared to be placed on the same footing in respect of extra-parochial places and divided parishes. However, the case of divided parishes and places is now further provided for by the 12 and 13 Viet. cap. 65, by the 6th section of which so much of this Act as applies to the making, levying, and collecting the county and borough rates in divided parishes and places, is repealed except as to rates theretofore made.\" The Act 4 & 5 Victoria, c. 48, rendered lands, tenements, and hereditaments, the property of, and in the occupation of municipal corporations, rateable to the relief of the poor in the same way as if they were not corporate property ; providing, however, that when such property lies in any parish which is situate wholly within the boundaries and limits of a city or borough, and in which city or borough the poor are relieved by one entire poor rate, or in which city or borough the poor within the boundaries or limits thereof as existing for municipal purposes at the time of the passing of the Municipal Corporations Act (1835) were then relieved by one entire poor rate, the exemption of such property from rateability should continue as if this Act had not passed. Municipal corporations are to be deemed the beneficial occupiers for rating purposes of all lands, &c, which they occupy. The Act 8 & 9 Victoria, c. 110, which is intituled \" An Act for the better collecting Borough Watch Bates in certain Places,\" it is provided that in every case in which any parish or place liable to support its own poor lies partly within and partly without any borough, and the council of such borough have appointed, or here after shall appoint, one or more persons to act as overseer or overseers"], [226, "208 ENGLISH MUNICIPAL INSTITUTIONS ; within that part of such parish or place, or those parts of such parishes or places, which is or are within the same borough, for making, levying, and collecting borough rates or watch rates, made or hereafter to be made therein, the person or persons so appointed may levy and raise by an equal rate of assessment upon all the pro perty within each of the parts of parishes or places for which he or they shall be so appointed, which if such part were a parish main taining its own poor would be rateable to the relief of the poor, such sums of money as are required in order to raise the several sums assessed upon such parts of parishes or places respectively, or to reimburse such person or persons as aforesaid such sums of money as he or they shall have paid for any borough or watch rate made by the council of the borough wherein such part of a parish or place shall be situate. The several clauses of the Act point out the way in which this is to be done, and the mode in which such district rates are to be levied. Further provisions in reference to the same subject are also contained in the 12 and 13 Viet. c. 65. The Act 23 & 24 Victoria, c. 16, gives the Treasury power in approving mortgages by municipal corporations to require that the money borrowed be repaid within a limited time by instalments, by a sinking fund, or by both means. When money paid into the Bank of England or Ireland, under any Act of Parliament, for the purchase of lands, &c, of the municipal corporation is paid out, the Treasury may require provision to be made for replacing the amount ; but this does not apply to cases in which provision is made in any local Act for the application of such money. The Treasury, when they authorise the sale of any land belonging to a municipal corporation, may direct the investment of the proceeds, and may afterwards authorise the application of such investments for the benefit of the borough. Town councils are authorised to acquire land with the consent of the Treasury. The council of any borough is authorised to submit a scheme to the Treasury for the payment of the borough mortgage debt, and the Treasury is empowered to sanction its being carried out. The Act contains some other provisions, but those we have given are the most important. The Act 32 & 33 Victoria, c. 81, amends the law with respect to the rating of occupiers for short terms, and the making and collecting of the poor's rate. Although its provisions with respect to the composition by owners for tenants' rates, and the retention of the franchise by the occupier notwithstanding such composition, apply to the municipal as well as the parliamentary suffrage, the measure forms part rather, on the one hand, of the general electoral"], [227, "THEIR GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT. 209 law, and on the other of the general poor law of the country than specifically ofthe law relating to municipal corporations. The Act 35 & 36 Victoria, c. 91, better known as the Borough Funds Act, is an important one. After reciting that it is expedient to extend the powers of governing bodies of boroughs, including municipal corporations, so as to enable them to employ the borough or other funds under the control of such governing body towards such costs, charges and expenses as may be incurred for the purposes and in the manner afterwards provided, it enacts by the second section that ' When in the judgment of a governing body in any district it is expedient for such governing body to promote or oppose any local and personal Bill or Bills in Parliament, or to prosecute or defend any legal proceedings necessary for the promotion or protection of the interests of the inhabitants of the district, it shall be lawful for such governing body to apply to the borough fund, borough rate, or other the public funds or rates under the control of such governing body to the payment of the costs and expenses attending the same; and when there are several funds or rates under the control of the governing body, such governing body shall determine out of which fund or funds, rate or rates, such expense shall be payable, and in what proportions : Provided that nothing in this Act contained shall authorise any governing body to promote any Bill in Parliament for the establishment of any gas or water works to compete with any existing gas or water company established under any Act of Parliament : Provided that no powers contained in this clause shall apply in any case where the promotion of or opposition to a Bill by a governing body has been decided by a Committee of either Houses of Parliament to be unreasonable or vexatious. By s. 3 no payment to anv member of a governing body for acting as council or agent in promoting or opposing any such bill is to be charged as aforesaid ; while it is provided by s. 4 that no expense in relation to promoting or opposing any Bill or Bills in Parliament is to be charged as aforesaid, unless incurred in pursuance of a resolution of an absolute majority of the whole number of the governing body at a meeting of the governing body, after ten clear days' notice by public advertise ment of such meeting, and of the purpose thereof, in some local newspaper published or circulating in the district, such notice to be in addition to the ordinary notices required for summoning such meeting, nor unless such resolution has been published twice in some newspaper or newspapers circulating in the district, and has received, in respect of matters within the jurisdiction of the. Local Government Board, the approval of such board, and in respect of other matters, p"], [228, "210 ENGLISH MUNICIPAL INSTITUTIONS; the approval of one of Her Majesty's secretaries of state, and in case of the promotion of a Bill in Parliament, no further expense shall be incurred or charged as aforesaid after the deposit of the Bill, unless the propriety of such promotion is confirmed by such absolute majority at a further special meeting to be held in pursuance of a similar notice not less than fourteen days after the deposit of the Bill in Parliament : Provided further, that no expense in promoting or opposing any Bill in Parliament to be charged as aforesaid unless such promotion or opposition has had the consent of the owners and ratepayers of that district, expressed by resolution in the manner provided in the Local Government Act (1858) for the adoption of that Act. Then, passing over two intermediate clauses, s. 7 empowers the Local Government Board, or one of Her Majesty's principal secretaries of state, to direct a local inquiry to be held upon any application under this Act, by any person or persons whom they may respectively nominate for the purpose, and to charge the costs and expenses of such local enquiry upon the governing body, or the person by whom such application shall be made. The preceding abstracts are, however, far from exhausting the provisions of the law in its relation to the financial powers of municipal corporations. As authorities charged with the promotion of sanitary and public works, and other objects of a comprehensive character, they are endowed with numerous facilities for the pro curation and disbursement of vast funds; but the references in Table 1 of this Section, and the Introduction and Tables of the succeeding Section, afford additional information upon this topic.

For a long time after the passing of the Act the instances of these transfers were very few, but at the present moment the sanitary authority is administered by a body independent of the Town Council in only fourteen* of the 240 cities and boroughs governed under it; in some of these places peculiar circumstances have operated to prevent the corporation assuming the sanitary jurisdiction. The New Charters' Act (1877) enacts, by section 7, that a \"scheme\" for incorporating a district shall, in every case, provide for placing the new borough within the jurisdiction of the Council as the sanitary authority. An exhaustive abstract of the miscellaneous Acts of Parliament,! which affect municipal corporations as sanitary and educational authorities, will hardly be looked for here. To give portions of the Acts might be misleading rather than useful, and to insert them in their entirety would be an undue encumbrance on our space. The annexed analysis sets out in a comprehensive form the subjects arising under them, and the necessary particulars for facilitating reference. 1.\u2014 POWERS AND DUTIES EOR SANITARY PURPOSES. * Banbury, Blandford, Caine, Cambridge, Chippenham, Faversham, Folkestone, Launceston, Lyme Regis, Lymington, Morpeth, Oxford, Stratford-upon-Avon, and Wenlock. t See page 1 4 and the Appendix. <ewage, Privies, Scavenging, jS/msances.

The Unreformed Corporations. The Table in this Part contains the names of all those corporations or municipal organizations which were reported upon by the Inquiry Commissioners in 1835, excepting those which were included in the schedules of 5 & 6 William IV., c. 76, and those which have since been incorporated under that statute. The number of places wherein an inquiry was instituted was 285, of which 178 were comprised in the schedules of the Municipal Act, and 7 (Aberavon, Ashton- under- line, Burton-on-Trent, Conway, Hartlepool, Hedon, and Yeovil) have, since it passed, been granted a charter under the provisions of"], [257, "239 THEIR growth and DEVELOPMENT. the Act. The remaining 100 \u2014 many of which were municipalities only in name \u2014 are set out in the Table following. The powers, privileges, and jurisdictions of the boroughs which were not subjected to the process of reformation were, under the old charters or prescriptive customs, retained, and have, in some cases, continued to be exercised to the present time. Little or no notice \u2014 legislative or otherwise \u2014 was taken of them, outside local circles, until the 29th of February, 1876, when Sir Charles Dilke attracted general attention to their anomalous position by a speech in the House of Commons, which he closed with a motion for the imme diate abolition of their criminal jurisdictions. The Home Secretary* undertook to consider the question raised, and to ascertain the best mode of dealing with what were, by common acquiescence, described as \" the unreformed boroughs,\" and the motion was thereupon withdrawn. A few weeks later Mr. Cross announced that a Royal Commission would be issued for a renewed inquiry into the state and practice of the corporate bodies named in the Firsts Report of the Municipal Commissioners of 1835. The Commission was issued in May, 1876 j and in the early part of the present session (Feb. 24, 1879) the chairman (the Right. Hon. S. Cave, M.P.) expressed the hope, from his place in the House of Commons, that the Commis sioners would be able to present their Report by the following Whitsuntide. On the 4th of December, 1877, the appended Report was for warded to the Treasury by the Secretary of the Commission (Mr. A. G. Liddell) :\u2014 \" A list of 101 boroughs not incorporated under the Municipal Reform Acts was submitted to the Commissioners by Mr. Secretary Cross. Up to the present date, witnesses have been examined in respect of 79. As to these the investigation is practically concluded except in those instances where, upon further con sideration, the Commissioners may find fresh evidence or explanation necessary. Separate draft Reports have been written on all the 79 cases, of wliich 10 have been finally agreed upon, while the rest are in the course of being settled by the Commissioners. In 22 instances where Corporations without possessions have become extinct, or where there is a manorial rather than a municipal body holding no property, the Commissioners have made inquiries by means of letters. In addition to the above-mentioned places, 10 others have, since the commence ment of the investigation, been suggested to the Commissioners as being of a municipal character. The Commissioners have reserved the consideration of these cases until they have gone through the list furnished by Mr. Secretary Cross.\" * Right Hon. E. A. Cross. t The second Report of the Commissioners of 1835 was confined to the Corpor ation of the City of London and the City Guilds."], [258, "240 ENGLISH MUNICIPAL INSTITUTIONS ; The list of 101 places submitted by Mr. Cross is the same as that contained in this Part, excepting only the borough of Burton upon-Trent, incorporated under the Municipal Acts on September 3rd, 1878.

In view of the probable simultaneous appearance of the Report of the Commissioners and this book, no attempt has been made to give any recent statistics in this Part beyond those of the population in 1871. The information contained in the Table may, however, provide useful and convenient points for comparison with that of later date obtained by the labour aud inquiries of the Com missioners. t Population of the Parliamentary borough; that of Lewes proper is 10,434.

Populous Districts not under Municipal Government. The Tables of the Census Returns of 1871 give a list of 938 places in England and Wales, which, in the opinion of the Registrar- General and his assistants, were to be classed as \" towns.\" They comprised municipal boroughs, places under Improvement Acts for sanitary purposes, and places of 2,000 or more inhabitants. Of the 938 towns in 1871, only 224 had a true municipal organiza tion, or, rather were governed under the Municipal Corporations Act of 1835. It is difficult to conceive the reason for so small a growth of municipal organizations from 1835 to 1871 ; the increase being only forty-six in thirty-six years. The Public Health Act, 1875, forms so complete a code of sanitary self-government law for local adminis tration by \"Urban\" authorities, which it also established in principle, that a certain indifference to the acquirement of corporate privileges could not now be regarded as affording matter for much surprise ; but, curiously enough, the three years following the passing of that Act shew a greater increase in the applications for and grants of municipal charters of incorporation than any like period from the year 1835. The charters issued in 1876 were four; in 1877, three; and in 1878, four. \"With the exception of the year 1868, when five charters were granted, the numbers for 1876 and 1878 have not been exceeded. The liability of the promoters of a corporate estabbshment to be saddled with the whole of the costs of an applica tion for a charter, if it proved to be unsuccessful, no doubt contributed to the apathy regarding the acquisition of the large advantages offered by the Municipal Act. The New Charters Act of 1877 lessened this liability by enacting that (s. 7) \"if the committee of Council (Privy Council) are satisfied that a local authority or other petitioners have properly promoted or properly opposed a scheme before them, and that for special reasons it is right that the reasonable costs incurred by the authority or other petitioners in such promotion or opposition should be paid as expenses, properly incurred by the local authority in the execution of their duties, the Committee of Council may order such costs to be paid, and these costs shall be paid accordingly.\" The facilities for obtaining a charter provided by this Act will, it is believed, eventually lead to a large addition to the number of petitions for charters of incorporation."], [273, "255 their growth and development. The number of Urban Sanitary Authorities in England and Wales iu December, 1878, exclusive of the Metropolitan Sanitary Authori ties, was 945. Deducting the 240 boroughs, governed under the 5 & 6 William IV., c. 76, there would be 705 \" urban \" districts in which a corporate organization under the Act was unknown, but as fourteen out of the 240 boroughs have a sanitary authority distinct from the town council, the total number of urban sanitary authorities, exclusive of those vested in town councils, was 719. The annexed List gives the whole of the urban sanitary authorities with a population above 3,000, in each county of England and Wales, with the exception of those vested in town councils and those co-existing with a town council, but distinct from it. The municipal and sanitary districts of the last-named authorities are in almost every case conterminous. The parliamentary boroughs of the metropolis are set out in preference to the sanitary authorities, which are very numerous and, in some instances, extremely circumscribed. The municipal borough with the smallest population is Hedon, where the inhabitants in 1871 numbered 996. The municipal boroughs, with a population (according to the census of 1871) under 3,000, are seventeen in number.
