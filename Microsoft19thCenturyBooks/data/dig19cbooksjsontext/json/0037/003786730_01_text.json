AND NEW YORK 1892 All rights reserved"], [8, "Copyright, iBgx, BY MACMILLAN & CO-"], [9, "CHAPTER I An Arabian historian living at Bussorah when Haroun-el-Raschid was Caliph in Bagdad describes this part of the world as the cradle of all arts and sciences, and the Euphrates as the river that ferti- lized the intellectual barrenness of the rest of the earth with the gold of solid erudition, the gems of eloquence and poetry, and the flowers of wit and humour, which were being constantly carried away on its flowing bosom. Other empires, previous to this epoch, had flourished along the banks of this famous river, glittering for a time in an almost in- conceivable splendour ; till they succumbed to that poisonous luxury which occasions the death of every civilization of which it is the offspring. Such like- wise was the fate which befell the proud sway of the Arabians, when the simplicity of their native manners was exchanged for the display and ostenta- tion that grew up naturally around their new state, and the cherished maxims of their forefathers were cast to the winds. Fostered by their relations with the people whom they had subdued, and who grovelled in the dust beneath their feet, there arose an arrogance of government and an insolence of B"], [10, "mariam CHAP. 2 individuals that soon cut off from Bagdad the stream of desert-bred warriors that had hitherto nourished it, who ill brooked the treatment of Asiatic under lings : and the glorious Caliphate stood helpless in her hour of need when she felt around her the whirl of Tartar tribes. In the last few hundred years the remaining splendours of the Euphrates have fast been ebbing away, and there remains little apart from its old-world association to give to this river some importance in the eyes of the civilized world at the present day. One morning in September, not many years ago, that portion of the Euphrates which forms the port of Bussorah \u2014 the latter town being situated a mile or two from the river's edge \u2014 presented a picturesque and animated scene. The sun blazed up overhead in an expanse of sky unflecked by a single cloudlet ; and the golden radiance that flooded the earth wrapt all things with a dazzling sheen. The magnificent brilliancy of the great luminary was indeed \u2014 to the eyes and the senses of a European \u2014 somewhat more than agreeable, and reminded one rather of the crushing power of a tyrant than the genial solicitude of a friend. There prevailed, in the remaining fea tures of the picture, a singular want of harmony ; for whilst the occasional great rough-built mansions \u2014 the residences, mainly, of agents of European com mercial companies \u2014 that rose on the left-hand bank, and the forests of date-palms behind and betwixt them and on the opposite bank, and the ' dhows ' or sailing-vessels anchored in the river, and the lono narrow canoes or ' balams ' that skimmed its surface with gaily coloured awnings flapping in the morning"], [11, "mariam I 3 breeze, and the human figures in the boats and on the land \u2014 turbaned and gowned or veiled \u2014 all agreed in the air of intense antiquity and Orientalism that pervaded them : on the water, in a straight line and in startling contrast with everything else, giving forth clouds of vapour and smoke, and creaking of chains and rattling of derricks as they heaved on board their various cargoes, lay four huge steamers. Around one of the latter the signs of greatest activity prevailed, though no longer in the loading of mer chandise. The Lornadale, from London, had taken on board as much cargo as it was possible to lodge below her main deck ; and she was now charging the latter and the spar-deck above it with a motley crowd of natives. Numerous ' balams ' converged towards her, and hovered about the skirts of the dense throng of similar boats that fringed her sides ; and when the moment presented itself, each ' balam ' shot eagerly to the goal of the boatmen's endea vours, and \u2014 as it seemed to the distant and uncon cerned on-looker \u2014 by a spasmodic convulsion, pro duced an upheaval of its human contents and ejected them on to the decks above. These passengers were pilgrims to Mecca. Every year thousands upon thousands of pious believers in the name of Mohamed desert their homesteads and wend their way, both by land and by sea, towards the country that saw the birth of their religion and witnessed the miraculous deeds of their arch-prophet. From China, India, and Persia ; from every quarter of the Turkish Empire ; from Egypt, Tripoli, Tunis, Algiers, and Morocco ; from Zanzibar and Senegal ; from Khurdistan, Beluchistan,"], [12, "MARIAM CHAP. 4 and Afghanistan; from the Soudan and the great Sahara, and from many other places whose existence is but dimly known in Europe, they throng \u2014 mostly poor and ignorant, but determined and devout in their purpose. They are pilgrims to the holy cities of Arabia, Mecca and Medina, and to reach them they starve themselves for years to save up sufficient money to defray their expenses, and endure horrible privations by the way. They commit themselves to the mercies of the vast and awe-inspiring sea, dreaded by all true Easterns ; they risk being robbed by the Bedouins or killed by the heat \u2014 and all with an amount of phlegm and good-humour that is almost sublime. Whatever happens to them they care not; God will provide for them ; and should they die on their way out, they will be received all the more readily into the mansions already provided for each one of them by their much-beloved prophet in the seven-storied paradise of Islam. Such were the people who now forsook for a moment the stillness of demeanour and the serenity of countenance which is characteristic of Orientals, and strove to reach the decks of the Lornadale by every method that seemed best adapted to attain that end, without regard for dignity. They were not averse to comfort, and welcomed with joy the presence of a ladder ; but if one was not handy they displayed the natural agility of their bodies by swarming up ropes or scrambling up the sides. The majority of the women, with an evident appreciation of the teachings of philosophy, left all arrangements for their own transport in the hands of the other sex, only reserving for themselves the rights of criti-"], [13, "MARIAM I 5 cism, in the enjoyment of which they considerably swelled the volume of sound that attended the pro gramme of embarkation ; and if they had reason to find fault with the due performance of that delicate operation they lost no time, the moment they gained their feet, in turning round and belabouring the pates of their careless swains. For an hour or two the decks gave one rather the idea of a pandemonium of yelling demons than of a gathering of quiet-loving believers in the doctrine of Fatalism. It was not easy to make distinctions, but everybody seemed to be fighting with everybody else ; screams of distress, yells of furious anger, threats and prayers, curses and blessings, succeeded each other in bewildering and ludicrous confusion ; and the gesticulation which accompanied this outpouring of tongues was both startling and effective. The disturbance, whilst it lasted, lay quite beyond the powers of description, and was produced by the search after and identifica tion of baggage, and the selection of sites for erect ing tents or spreading carpets. It must be noted that women were no less forward in this business than it is their nature to be in any other, even amidst the gentle struggles of Western life. One fat old lady, who had evidently been prospecting the ship before, and had fixed her eye on a particularly cosy nook for her own share of the deck, when she came on board found this identical spot occupied by three grave long-bearded merchants of Bussorah, who had taken possession of it the night before, and were now solemnly occupied in reading and intoning the Koran. Furiously she ordered them away, and since, by reason of their present abstraction from"], [14, "MARIAM 6 CHAP. worldly cares, they seemed at first too much lost in astonishment at her demeanour to comply with her modest request, she proceeded to give them a prac tical demonstration of her meaning by preparing to pull up the carpet on which they were sitting. On this they started up, and not only allowed her to appropriate the locality for herself and her husband, who stood by looking on in a half-frightened man ner, but also served her submissively in bringing up her boxes and massing them around her, whilst she squatted on her haunches, and treated them to her views on things in general. Another woman came on board with a husband who wore the Turkish costume, and was evidently stricken with the ague, his pallid, sickly features and shrunken frame contrasting strangely with her stal wart proportions. She had herself the appearance of one who in her younger days had possessed con siderable beauty ; but at present she was most re markable for her stature and the length of her arms. Until the whole contingent of pilgrims from Bagdad and Bussorah had been embarked, and the hubbub had quieted down, she was certainly the most con spicuous figure on the deck ; wherever the din was greatest, or the aspect of things most threatening, her black shroud could be plainly distinguished ; and her arms wildly sawing the surrounding atmosphere, in frantic expostulations or soul-withering impreca tions, gave her the appearance of an inspired wind mill. She first attended to the comfort of her hus band, fighting bravely for a suitable place to deposit him in ; and in the execution of this laudable en deavour she pushed aside all intervening obstacles"], [15, "MARIAM I 7 \u2014 whether animate or inanimate \u2014 with a careless bravado that was most edifying. But by this arbi trary mode of procedure, which might have been expected to bring down summary vengeance on her head, she ran no risks, for no man offered to raise a finger against her, in spite of the occasional harsh ness of her measures : one she tumbled down the hatchway, and two or three others she sent sprawl ing on their backs; but even in that uncomfortable attitude they merely remonstrated with her and exhorted her mildly to pray to Allah and the Pro phet for an increase of gentleness in her touch and temper. When she had tucked up her little husband comfortably, she devoted her attention to public affairs, and careered about the decks, helping others with advice and an occasional thwack. Yet under all this she possessed a heart as kind, and a nature as sensitive to the sufferings of others, as any of her more decorous and tender sisters ; and the attention she lavished on her sickly husband throughout the voyage, and the efforts she was continually making to alleviate the discomforts of anyone else unwell near her, won for the wife of Jusuf Effendi, as the little man was called, a general regard. Such was the varied scene which presented itself to the gaze of a certain individual, on whom, by a remarkable dispensation of Providence, in addition to his patronymic designation of Lanxon, there had been bestowed the honoured name of Christopher on the occasion of his first visit (in swaddling-clothes) to the parish church of his native village in Cornwall ; and whom, for reasons which will become presently manifest, it is of importance to introduce to the"], [16, "8 MARIAM CHAP. reader's particular notice. Christopher Lanxon early manifested in disposition \u2014 perchance through some occult influence that in the present state of the psychical sciences is beyond our powers of demon stration and analysis \u2014 a striking similarity to his illus trious namesake, and rapidly developed signs of an ingrained tendency to investigate the secrets of un known worlds, both of matter and of mind. Many were the countries he had visited, giving up to this purpose every long vacation in which he was fortu nate enough, by interest with the owners, or friendli ness with the captains, to secure a passage on board a cargo-steamer, for a two months' cruise ; during which he had every opportunity of indulging his hobby, and indeed for seeing many view's of life that are hidden from those that tread the ordinary groove of a tourist's mode of travelling, without incurring half the expense that the latter entails. Hence, though not more than twenty-four years of age, his mind was furnished with so plentiful and miscella neous a store of observations, that the stranger, to whom for a moment the secrets of his memory were laid bare, was often inclined to mistrust this appear ance of youth. It is not to be wondered at that when, shortly after he had passed the final examina tion which made him a graduate in medicine of the University of London, his present post of surgeon to the Lornadale was offered him, he should have accepted it with eagerness. He regarded it as the last chance of such a nature that he might indulge in, and indeed with something of the feelings with which a courted belle reviews the pleasant vanities of her past existence, and concludes them with a"], [17, "I MARIAM 9 final outburst of frivolous enjoyment, on the eve of her settling down into married life, which, though prosaic, is yet sufficiently alluring to determine her to discard the quips and becks and pranks of the past in favour of the dignified deportment of the staid and responsible matron. For Christopher Lanxon had, by this time, formed ties \u2014 the sweet ness of which he fully appreciated \u2014 that would com pel, him through the gentle violence of yearning with which they filled him, to engage with earnest perse verance in the fierce competition in money-making, which we call the battle of life, and which he had hitherto regarded with that contempt which a youth who has all his bills \u2014 however moderate \u2014 regularly paid by his father, can well afford to indulge in. He was betrothed to a young lady some four years his junior ; and for her dear sake he was gladly willing to engage in the drudgery by which the bread-and butter of our daily lives has to be won, nothing daunted by the long vista of years that in his mind's eye he could see, each one rivalling the other in blank dreariness, interfering with his vision of the golden promise of the future. After this voyage he would settle down to a life of unremitting toil. Reclining lazily on one of those wicker couches which are much beloved by the European in climes whose overpowering warmth compel him to sink for comfort in a state of listless recumbency, whilst yet he strives to retain the dignity of elevation in pre ference to the lowly cushions and carpets which the natives affect, Christopher Lanxon watched with absorbing interest, from the quarter-deck, the eager evolutions of the excited crowd in front of the"], [18, "MARIAM CHAP. 10 captain's deck-cabin. The figures, the costumes, and the manners of these people were by no means new to him ; yet they remained sufficiently novel and extraordinary to fill him with a sense of enjoy ment: particularly as he knew sufficient Arabic to understand the meaning of their words, and catch the humour of the various situations and dialogues that the very complicated state of affairs naturally gave rise to. The single companion who shared with him the loneliness of the quarter-deck viewed the scene with absolute indifference ; he was the agent's clerk, a Christian native of Bagdad who was acquainted with the English language and habited in the white linen tunic and trousers that form the dress of Europeans in this part of the world. For the moment, however, his tunic was laid aside, and his thin singlet was opened widely at the collar and rolled up at the sleeves ; he was ponderously stout and of a gouty build, and the great heat taxed the powers of his constitution to such an extent that he was fain to support his life by emptying the big tumbler of soda-water with a faint tincture of whiskey, that stood on the skylight by his side, at intervals of fifteen minutes, and fan himself in the meanwhile, whilst the steward's boy furnished a fresh supply of the life-sustaining fluid. These self sustaining labours absorbed him for the moment. At length the embarkation was completed, the ship's whistle bade farewell to Bussorah with three prolonged and lugubrious wails, the pistons began to rise and fall with rhythmic thuds, the propeller lashed the quiet water into spluttering, heaving eddies ; and the Lornadale, making a wide and"], [19, "I MARIAM 11 graceful curve, swept past the various buildings along the banks, and commenced her course down the river. The black pilot \u2014 he had been brought in his early youth from Zanzibar as a slave, but had now risen to a lucrative and honoured post, though still not many years past twenty \u2014 stood up straight and eager in the centre of the bridge. He never for a moment allowed his eyes to shirk their duty, but ever and anon dropped an observation to the captain at his side, in broken English, anent the naviga tion of the river, which served the admirable purpose of keeping the latter in a complete atmosphere of mystification, tending to fill him with a sense of his own ignorance, and prevent him from interfering with the management of his own ship."], [20, "CHAPTER II In the dreamy state of mind which a relaxed tone of the system induces, Christopher Lanxon took note of the thickest groves of date-palms that bordered each side of the river, and felt awaken within him that vague enthusiasm which wild and romantic scenery is wont to inspire in young and imaginative persons. Right from the water's edge the spare and stately stems arose, and shot up to various heights, till above they modestly veiled from sight the ripen ing clusters of succulent produce by means of their arched and drooping branches. Here and there the swift-gliding steamer left behind it some rough-built mansion, or passed some picturesque group of Bedouins \u2014 belonging to inferior tribes, such as offer their services towards the wane of each summer season to the merchants of Bussorah for the picking and packing of dates \u2014 lounging in picnic fashion in the deep shade amidst the trees. No longer engaged by the hubbub amidst the pilgrims on board, who had by this time fallen into a perfect silence, Lanxon gave himself up to the wondering thoughts that the sight of these innumerable trees evoked in him con cerning the singular nation with whom they have"], [21, "CHAP. II MARIAM 13 always been identified, and indeed do very aptly symbolize. The deep and solemn silence of the forests, and the mysterious gloom of their far-reach ing glades, lent themselves to this train of cogitation concerning the strange land whose northernmost frontiers they guarded ; a land that throughout the distant ages had maintained herself free from the tread of a conqueror, and despite her insignificant population \u2014 never probably exceeding a dozen mil lions or so of human beings \u2014 had contrived, during the seventh and eighth centuries of our era, to bring under subjection half the known world, and impress on the conquered peoples her peculiar institutions, her language, and her faith. Few other families of mankind have, at one period or another of their history, occupied such wide geographical areas as her sons. And wherever they obtained a sure footing, the Arabians never failed to impart forward impulses, whose early promises bore fruit, in some instances of such excellence as to bear comparison with the productions of the greatest civilizations that have gladdened the face of the earth ; and were only hindered in their utmost realizations by the too rigid adherence of this noble race to a form of religion which, perfectly as it fulfilled its original purpose, was too strictly and accurately defined to adapt itself to an entirely new set of circumstances. Yet, whilst thus sending forth her sons to achieve these great triumphs, and take part on the merry-go-round that all the rest of the world continually indulges in, Arabia herself has never changed to any considerable degree ; and the nomads of her deserts still pursue the same mode of life, wear the same clothes, and"], [22, "MARIAM CHAP. 14 make use of the identical forms of expression as they did even in the days when Abraham entertained the Angel unawares in the plain of Mamre. The thought of this unchangeableness of Arabia \u2014 the proud independence and self-reliance that never allowed her to be affected by the constant vagaries and changes of her neighbours \u2014 could not but impress Lanxon with a sense of wonder and admiration ; whilst yet his mind revolted against the isolation and quiescence that such a state implied. Apart from his surroundings, there was a circum stance \u2014 into which considerations of a personal nature entered \u2014 which encouraged this train of thought in Lanxon's mind. He was aware that the Lornadale was presently to embark a further contin gent of pilgrims, derived from one of the old and noble tribes of Arabia ; and the interest and curiosity with which he looked forward to his approaching acquaintance with these people naturally filled his mind and coloured his reflections. The latter had caused him to become so oblivious to the flight of time that it made him start up with surprise when the propeller and pistons ceased their rhythmical movements, and the anchor rattled down into the bed of the river. The Lornadale had brought up opposite a group of low buildings that peeped out from betwixt the overhanging palm-trees ; whilst a crowd of people fringed the bank and made prepa rations for their transit. Captain Pohvarth left the bridge, and came aft to the quarter-deck, wiping the moisture off his face. \" By George, doctor,\" he said, \" this is something like heat ! \""], [23, "II MARIAM 15 Lanxon hastened to assure the captain of the sympathy which \u2014 by reason of his own participation in the trouble \u2014 stirred him on his behalf ; whilst the clerk expressed his feelings with a grunt that shaded off towards its extremity into a mournful sigh. They spoke no more, but, stretched at full length in all the dampy whiteness of their habiliments, and a general limpness of attitude, gazed dreamily at the banks, and languidly listened to the muffled sounds of many tongues that came floating across. The perfect silence that reigned on board was, however, broken the instant the new-comers stepped on board ; and the scene underwent a sudden and startling change of aspect. It was a bewildering sight. There were about two hundred in the throng, all arrayed in the same free-and-easy deshabille of Eastern dress, with flowing robes and towering tur bans ; or graceful head-coverings of coloured stuff, encircled round their brows by thick black cords, in the orthodox Bedouin fashion. All assembled here with the same idea : the awful undertaking of a long and possibly stormy sea-voyage \u2014 so repugnant to the prejudices of quiet-loving Orientals, to whom motion of any kind is eminently disagreeable \u2014 with the ultimate object of paying their devoirs at the tomb of Mohamed in Medina. Such a prospect in com mon ought to have filled them with sympathy for each other. The thought of so dismal an immediate future might have been expected to take all comba tiveness out of their composition ; to leave them no stomach for hard blows ; to fill them with the spirit that impelleth a man to suffer meekly, if not exactly to long for another blow. And yet here they were"], [24, "16 MARIAM CHAP. fighting like very devils ! They spat in each other's faces ; they tore each other's beards out ; they took off their slippers and battered each other's heads with them ; they cursed each other with a fluency which, if it had only been exercised in better chan nels, might have qualified each of them for the laureateships of Arabia and Persia. The disturbance had arisen with the suddenness of a whirlwind. Perhaps a Bagdadi or Bussori had had one of his corns trodden on ; an event which, in a climate of so irritating an influence, might well be expected to give rise to a catastrophe. Perhaps these strangers were possessed with an idea that the ship had been especially built and commissioned by their much-beloved Prophet for their own exclusive use, and were exceedingly wroth at finding others in quiet possession of it. However it may be, to the doctor and his companions on the quarter-deck there seemed no rhyme or reason for such ebullitions of temper, such violent commotions of bodies ; espe cially in view of the fearful summer's heat, which caused the perspiration to stream off their own quiescent selves in rivulets. They grouped them selves close to the combatants, not feeling called upon to interfere, since it was not quite clear to them what it was all intended for. Amidst this seething mass of infuriated maniacs Lanxon caught occasional glimpses of a singular figure. Now it was hidden or swept away from his sight by some burly combatant ; now again he had a peep at it as, with arms lifted high in the air, it appeared to be attempting, like another Peter the Hermit, the difficult feat of preaching a sermon in"], [25, "II MARIAM 17 the midst of a battle. The owner of it was no fighter, it was evident. His was the strength of intellect. In physique he was puny in comparison to the wiry giants that were surging around and occasionally, as it almost seemed, over him. He dodged the rapidly descending blows with marvellous agility : now springing aside, now scrambling through the narrow cleft and escaping imminent destruction by a hair's-breadth, as two figures closed together in mortal combat. High above the bewildering din rose his shrill voice in earnest exhortations, in ejaculations of angry surprise, in occasional soul withering imprecations as some death-laden slipper flitted past his own features in a proximity suffi ciently great to concentrate his attention for the moment on his own danger. He was evidently trying to allay the tumult. He poured on them oceans of rhetoric ; he made use of every argument sanctioned by the Oriental system of logic. But it is doubtful whether he would have succeeded in his object had not something happened which made them pause in their work of destruction, filled with an all-pervading sense of wonder \u2014 an emotion to which Easterns are peculiarly susceptible. The sound of a fearful whack, louder than all the rest, had rent the air, so that one could almost hear the dislocated cerebral matter rattle in its bony en closure ; and incontinently a huge Bagdadi sprawled on the deck at Lanxon's feet with a groan similar to that of a full-sized organ-pipe. Two women who had hitherto been quaking with fright in a corner now tumbled out on to the fallen warrior \u2014 one was his wife, and the other her mother \u2014 and with manifold c"], [26, "18 MARIAM CHAP. cries of lamentation, interspersed with an occasional term of endearment for the corpse, they scratched their eyes and tore their hair and beat their bosoms in a heart-rending display of never-to-be-allayed grief. And the more Lanxon assured them that he was not dead, but would revive again, the more they shrieked. This had a wonderful effect on the clerk. He had become hotter and perspired more freely and breathed harder than ever at the exciting spectacle ; so that his life seemed in some danger from the vehemence of his sympathy. Now7, as the cry of the distressed women reached his ears, he could contain himself no longer, but with a roar of rage seized hold of a tremendous spar lying close by, and charged full tilt into the midst of them, like another Don Quixote de la Mancha. They let go of each other and, separating, formed a lane between them, through which the spar passed without hurting their bodies. This was not a mode of warfare they were accustomed to, and a chorus of ejaculations arose : \" Wallah ! it is wonderful ! \" They stared at the intruder, and then he, still holding the spar tucked up under his right arm, raised his left in the air and, with effective and startling move ments of his fingers in the way of gesticulation, delivered to them a lecture on the folly of mankind in general, and their own in particular. With solemn attention they listened to his criticisms. And now, through the serried throng of big men, there struggled forwards into the open lane the little figure that had already attracted Lanxon's attention. It was that of a small thin man, with angular features, thin lips, and pointed beard. His countenance was"], [27, "MARIAM II 19 sallow and earthy-looking ; but from his black eyes there flashed forth a brilliancy wonderful to behold. Attired in a gown of some light print material secured round his waist by a sash of white silk worked in gold thread, over this a magnificent robe of dark blue cloth lined with crimson, and on his head a white turban also worked in gold thread, of such dimensions that it served him in the place of a sun shade, he looked the very 'beau ideal' of a wizard. His movements had a certain uncanny restlessness about them, and his eyes an unnatural degree of mobility, which contributed much to this effect. He advanced towards the group, alternately smirk ing, bowing, and salaaming. He evidently had some acquaintance with the western mode of salutation, but seemed to be doubtful whether it alone were sufficient to meet the overwhelming exigencies of the present case. He addressed himself at first to all of them with equal deference ; but when he had ascertained which of them was the captain, he made straight for him and appealed to him for protection \u2014 in excellent English \u2014 since if the wounded man were to die, there would arise an eternal blood-feud between his party and the Bagdadis and others, who were in the great majority. Captain Polwarth's mental balance was so disturbed at the language that he heard proceed from this extraordinary-looking individual that he felt at a loss to find words for some moments; nor was the as tonishment exhibited by the steward \u2014 who had just made his appearance with a further supply of refresh ments \u2014 and the other spectators on the quarter-deck inferior to his own."], [28, "MARIAM CHAr. II 20 \" Certainly, certainly ! \" he exclaimed, as soon as he had sufficiently recovered himself. \"But, man,\" he added, \"your tongue belies your appearance. Who are you, and where do you come from ? \" \" It is written,\" said the other with a smile, \"that from the tongue of man cometh forth lying counsel. Verily my appearance indicates my origin ; but I have travelled \u2014 aye, and by the grace of Allah have even resided in the country which you claim as your own. \" Ha ! is that it? \" cried the captain. \" Well, you are welcome on board of this ship. What do they call you in your own country? \" \" Ismar Ben Ali, of the Beni Kasym.\" \" So ! By Jove, doctor, that's a name more diffi cult to tackle than even some of our Cornish ones ! Do you remain with us? Are you also going to Mecca?\" \" Even so \u2014 Inshallah ! But, with your favour, I must speak to the doctor concerning the wounded creature from Bagdad.\" So saying, Ismar salaamed and turned to Lanxon, who was already on his knees by the side of the prostrate townsman, whose stature had been the cause of more assiduous attention to his head than was adapted to its constitution, and inquired of him concerning the case."], [29, "CHAPTER III DURING the fight on deck, there had issued from certain of the canoes drawn up alongside the ship occasional cries of distress in the vocal key common to feminine throats ; continued, once or twice (after a more than usually sonorous concussion), into the lengthened tension peculiar to the scream indicative of fright ; but these sounds, in the hubbub and ex citement of the moment, had scarcely been noticed. Now, however, when hostilities had ceased, and the captain had promised to shoot the first man who attempted again to divest himself of his slippers with fell intent, there mounted the gangway a column of ladies, whose proud gait, even as they trod on the uncertain boards, and rich coverings evidently denoted them to be of high degree. Ismar informed Lanxon that most of these be longed to the family of the great Sheikh Nasr. Some of them were to become passengers on board the Lornadale, bound to Mecca. The rest had come to shed a few tears over the latter ere they departed on their holy mission. Silently the veiled column swept over the site of the late combat, relics of which still lay strewn about in the shape of tattered"], [30, "MARIAM CHAP. 22 bits of raiment, mutilated slippers, and an occa sional tuft of hair. Secure from the observation of the bystanders, who, though not yet free from the excitement of the late encounter, showed considera ble delicacy of thought in ranging themselves in stantly out of their way, pushing or pulling back any unobservant member of their number with no gentle hand, they eagerly scanned the several features of the picture presented to their eyes as they advanced towards the quarter-deck. Here, the captain's per mission having been granted, half a dozen attentive Bedouins unhitched the dividing rope and stood by respectfully as the ladies crossed the boundary. Three of these ladies deserve the reader's especial attention, as he will make their intimate acquaint ance in the course of his perusal of this book. Two of them were tall, above the average of women ; one somewhat exceeding the other in this respect. They were slim in proportion to their height, but differ ing in that the taller showed the outline of mature, and her companion that of budding, womanhood. The gracefulness of their deportment was marvel lous ; the soft clinging draperies with which they were enshrouded harmonizing the component curves, and by subduing the individual features enhancing the general effect of their figures. They moved with that easy gliding step which, whilst it suggests pre-eminently repose, is yet instinct with a sense of latent energy, and disclaims all acquaintance with cramped boots and high heels ; their feet, encased in richly wrought slippers, peeping from under the caressing border of the shroud at each advance, and revealing the high instep which is characteristic of"], [31, "Ill MARIAM 23 the Arabian race, and bequeathed by it to the women of the south of Spain. The elder of these two was Ayesha, the wife of the Sheikh ; the younger, Mariam, his niece. They walked to gether, behind the lady next to be described. At the first glance one could see, by the absence in her step of the springiness of youth, the fuller proportions of her figure, and the absence of that delicate symmetry of form which distinguished the other two, that she was considerably older than either. In height also there was a considerable dif ference. But what she lost in gracefulness she gained in dignity and stateliness ; and as she led the column, it required no great power of discernment to see that \u2014 whether or not it were her right \u2014 she was allowed to figure as the first in importance. This lady was the widow of the late Sheikh of the Beni Kasym, who had been succeeded by his brother Nasr some four years back ; and according to the fashion of her people, she was known by the designation of Im-Abdallah or mother of Abdallah, her only son, who in time would succeed to the high rank of his uncle. The man who had been struck down in the fight still lay prone across the boundary which divided the quarter-deck from that which was occupied by the pilgrims ; whilst his two female relatives squatted beside him, and watched, with countenances whose anxiety was sufficiently revealed by the eyes, that alone of all the features remained unveiled, the en deavours of the surgeon to restore him to conscious ness. As her glance fell on this group, Im-Abdallah paused and inquired of Ismar the meaning of it."], [32, "24 MARIAM CHAP. \"There has been a fight, O wife of my cousin,\" said Ismar. \" So it seemed to us from the various sounds that reached our ears,\" said Im-Abdallah ; \" but what was the reason of it, in the name of the Prophet ? \" Ismar shrugged his shoulders and smiled dubiously. \" Allah alone knows,\" he said. \" And this man has apparently received an in jury,\" continued Im-Abdallah in the same low voice; whilst the other ladies of her party, who were grouped around, expressed by various soft ejacula tions and gestures their sympathy with the sufferer and his relatives. \" Is it serious, kinsman ? \" \" Allah forbid ! \" said Ismar with devout emphasis. \" He is under the care of one who has the varied re sources of Feringhistan at his command.\" \" This youth ? Is he, by the grace of Allah, learned in the noble art of healing?\" said the lady, regard ing Lanxon with interest. The slight gesture of consciousness with which the latter received this reference to himself betrayed to the sharp eyes that were watching him his compre hension of the dialogue. \" Ha ! behold ! it appears he understands our lan guage,\" murmured Mariam. Her voice, which contained, amidst its various manifestations, that subtle ring of repressed and mysterious voluptuousness which, when recognized, affords an index to the bloom of budding woman hood that leaves no room for doubt concerning the latter \u2014 even though no other sense corroborates its evidence \u2014 caused Lanxon to lift his head with a quick movement. But his eyes could distinguish through"], [33, "TIT MARIAM 25 the coloured veil that met them only vague indica tions of the features that lay behind it. \" Even so,\" said Ismar, in answer to Im-Abdallah. \" He is attached to the ship by reason of his capa cities in that respect, in order that all that travel herein may have the benefit of his attention.\" \"Allah aid you in your endeavours, O Hakim ! \" said Im-Abdallah, inclining her head graciously. \" Lady,\" said Christopher Lanxon in Arabic, \" Allah is merciful. Behold, his eyes even now open, and his soul returns to him ! He will live, without fail.\" \" Praise be to Allah ! \" exclaimed Im-Abdallah, whilst a similar murmur arose from the other veiled figures. \" You have listened to the words of the Ha Kim, my sister, and you, my daughter,\" she con tinued to the two females, who had bent themselves over the prostrate figure in eager excitement to catch the first signs of returning life in the counte nance which was so dear to them ; \" nor must you any longer doubt the good intentions of Allah towards you in this matter. Cheer up, therefore, and vex not your spirits with unnecessary lamenta tions. Men are foolish, but Allah is lenient towards their foolishness. May the Blessed Prophet and Ali have you in their safe keeping ! \" Stirred alike by the joyful emotions that super vened on the visible improvement in the fallen Bagdadi and by the kindliness that distinguished the tones of Im-Abdallah's voice, even more than the sense of her words, the two women, swayed by a common impulse, seized hold of her hands and, with many ejaculations of gratitude, kissed them and"], [34, "MARIAM CHAr. 26 bedewed them with their tears. Gently freeing her self, Im-Abdallah turned and, followed by her com pany, descended to the saloon, half the cabins of which had been engaged on their behalf. In a few moments the quarter-deck was covered with a crowd of men who resembled in appearance, as closely as a photograph does its original, the ideal Arab of the imagination ; the belief in whom has some what waned since sundry holiday travellers have given their accounts of the degraded and corrupt tribes which in their hurried excursions they have alone met, or even mistaken for Bedouins the half bred scum, made up principally of the refuse of the peasantry, which infests the outlying portions of the Turkish dominions. Their apparel was remarkable both for its scrupulous neatness and for its singular picturesqueness of effect. There was no mistaking them. They wrere genuine Arabians ; with spare stalwart frames, tanned complexions, aquiline fea tures, and large soft eyes with that dreamy far-away look in them which is so characteristic of their race. In Europe that expression belongs rather to the specially imaginative or thoughtful, and is not to be met with in the vast majority, whose lives are spent in constant and present action. But amongst Arabians it is the rule. It is the impression on their souls of the Desert and its vast solitudes ; the brilliancy, depth, and apparent nearness of its Firma- ment, inviting the spirit of man to forget the earth and lose itself in communion with that of the Uni verse ; the serenity of their easy if somewhat mono tonous lives, unbroken except by the occasional ex citement of a fight, which is just sufficient to afford"], [35, "MARIAM ni 27 them the amount of sensation which must enter into a human life to make it pleasant ; the effect of that awful span of time, covering many thousands of years, through which their customs, their manners, their laws, their speech, their thoughts, and their poetry have descended to them. The startling contrasts which continually present themselves in the Eastern character are puzzling to a European, who is more accustomed to a repressed and smoother flow of feeling; and Christopher Lanxon was somewhat amazed at the utter absence of any trace of the recent upheaval of temper which he had just witnessed, in the countenances of these Bedouins. The fiery light which had gleamed in their eyes during the fray had vanished ; and instead there reigned the serenity of expression which was habitual to them. One young fellow of about twenty, a glorious specimen of manhood, and a bit of a dandy besides (he was youngest brother to the great Sheikh Nasr, who had not come on board ; and he had travelled and spent some months in the pleasure-loving city of Damascus), still seemed some what excited, but laughed good-humouredly as he chatted over the events of the skirmish, and bound the silk girdle from his waist around his forehead to allay the bleeding from a cut he had received. There came along a long-bearded Bagdadi, who made a great salaam and apologized in fluent lan guage for the wound he had inflicted on him. The Sheikh's brother cut him short with a friendly ges ture. \" Wallah ! \" he exclaimed, \" we are brothers and should not be at enmity. Things happen around us"], [36, "28 MARIAM CHAP. without our knowing the cause thereof. Why we quarrelled I know not ; but let it not remain on your mind that I bear you any ill-feeling. When you ar rive at the end of your holy journey, remember me. When you return, think of me as your friend ! \" The Bagdadi withdrew with another deep reve rence. Lanxon, who had watched this little incident, and understood what had been said, came forward and held out his hand to the young Arab. The latter gazed in his face for one moment, and then took it cordially. When Lanxon spoke to him in Arabic, he expressed a joyful surprise and entered into con versation, in the midst of which he bespoke his good services in the interests of the ladies of his family who were proceeding to Mecca. There were his brother the present Sheikh's wife, his late brother's widow, and the latter's daughter, a young lady of seventeen. As they were talking, a boy came up whose handsome clear-cut features expressed that complete candour of soul which is so seldom met with in the sophisticated youth of civilized coun tries, and a gravity of demeanour which is appa rently common to all Arabians from the moment they are conscious of their own existence ; and is probably due to the early sense of responsibilities and importance which is fostered by their education, and to their dependence on their parents for all the instruction they receive \u2014 for books and schools are not common in Arabia \u2014 which inclines their minds to regard the imitation of the latter in all things as the mark of a properly constituted and intelligent mind. This latter circumstance also explains the"], [37, "Ill MARIAM 29 extreme respect for age generally, and for parents in particular, which is met with amongst Arabians ; nor are there many nations wherein the mother receives more honour from her offspring. This boy, though only twelve years of age, was dressed in the same costume as the others: a gown of spotless white linen, reaching from the shoulders to the ankles, wrapped round his person and secured about the waist with a broad silk sash of alternate red and white stripes ; over this an ample light-brown camo line cloak of exceedingly fine texture, worked at the collar in gold thread, with wide sleeves ; red slippers, and a head-covering or ' kefyeh ' of white silk striped with red, secured round the brow by thick black silk and gold cords, and falling gracefully on his shoulders. He gazed proudly at Lanxon for a moment, and then laid his small hand affectionately in that of the Sheikh's brother, who introduced him to Lanxon as Abdallah, his nephew and the Sheikh's probable heir. Although the general effect of their apparel was one of great simplicity and void of any ostentatious richness, there were many indications about these Bedouins, such as the fine texture of the cloaks and the silken quality of the waist-girdles and head coverings of many amongst them, that revealed to an eye experienced in the Arabian costume the wealth and power of their tribe. This prepared Lanxon for the further particulars on this subject that came to him in the course of conversation with them ; all of which corroborated the vague rumours he had heard concerning the Beni-Kasym in Bus sorah. Though Bedouins are usually very reticent"], [38, "MARIAM CHAP. 30 with strangers in matters concerning themselves, they were not so in this instance, but spoke freely, \u2014 probably in the desire of ingratiating themselves with the people into whose hands they were about to commit the safe-keeping of such valued members of their family. They told Lanxon that Sheikh Nasr was the Emir of all the tribes of the Beni-Kasym, who were amongst the richest, in flocks of sheep and camels, of all the rich tribes of the Northern Desert, and possessed besides vast tracts of date-gardens, the produce of which they sold to the merchants of Bussorah and Bagdad. Sheikh Nasr was a stout ally of the great Emir of Djebel Shammar, who ruled over the major portion of Central Arabia, himself removed by only a few generations from an ancestor who had been no more than the Sheikh of one of the smaller Shammar tribes. So great were the resources of the Beni-Kasym that they were able to place on the field of battle at least five thousand well-equipped horsemen, besides a very much larger number of foot warriors and camel-riders. In such interesting and friendly conversation the moments slipped by till word was brought to Lanxon that a sailor was struck down with one of those attacks of illness which occur with such startling suddenness in these climes. Having seen him, he ran below into the saloon for the purpose of mixing a draught, and found herein assembled all the ladies that he had previously watched descending. There were some fifteen of them : most of them sitting gravely on the sofas ; one or two lolling idly on the table. He had heard their voices in loud and eager talk as he came down the stairs ; but the moment he"], [39, "MARIAM Ill 31 entered, every lifted veil was dropped instinctively, and the fifteen figures might have been made of nothing more animate than stone, so quiet and still did they become. Lanxon, who at most times was a callous individual and did not lose his wits easily, was conscious of a vague terror as he advanced through the saloon ; and both his hands and eyes were so much at fault by the time he reached the medicine-chest that for some moments he groped amongst the bottles in sheer helplessness before he secured, by some sort of accident, the one he was in search of. He had never before so thoroughly ap preciated the immense advantage that this custom of veiling themselves secures to Eastern women. A man has not the ghost of a chance. It is bad enough, in all conscience, to run alone the gauntlet of fifteen pairs of inquisitive female eyes when you can stare back into the faces of their owners and essay, in some measure, to put them out of countenance. But what is that compared to the ordeal of having to submit to their gaze without the slightest possi bility of fighting them with their own weapons ? Lanxon knew it was of no use for him to raise his eyes. It would not abash them in the least. Not the most ardent glance that he could level at those veils would secure for him more than vague and shadowy outlines, each more or less similar to the other, of what lay behind them : and they knew it. To confront them would be merely to surrender himself ; for it would only have enabled them to read with certainty the confusion that overwhelmed him. He seized the bottle and poured some of its contents out without any very definite idea of what he was"], [40, "32 MARIAM CHAP. Ill doing. It was a drug possessed of potent qualities, and the result might have been disastrous to the poor sailor, were it not that less than half of it ever reached the deck. The rest lay spilt in the saloon in a line corresponding with that of Lanxon's retreat. When he reached the deck, preparations were already being made for the resumption of the voyage, and presently the captain gave the signal for all but passengers to leave the ship. The majority of the Arabians regained their boats, leaving on board the three ladies who were to perform the pilgrimage and a suite of eight females and a score or so of males, of whom most were Bedouins, and the others African slaves, under the orders of Ismar Ben Ali, who was the Sheikh's cousin. And the propeller having once more been set in motion, the Lornadale fired a fare well from her single piece of ordnance and continued her course down the river."], [41, "CHAPTER IV By this time all signs of the recent fray had disap peared ; nor, so soon as it became certain that the accident which had befallen the unlucky Bagdadi would be followed by no serious result, did any but friendly words and glances pass betwixt the towns men and their new fellow-travellers. The Bagdadi himself had fully recovered the use of his faculties, and after assuring Lanxon that the only circum stance of the occurrence that dwelt in his memory was the kindness which he had received at his hands, he accompanied his wife and mother-in-law back to the spot which they had chosen for their domicile. A busy hum pervaded the decks ; people were making themselves comfortable, and here and there impromptu tents were rigged up, to ensure the privacy of the women. In like manner, by order of Ismar, after consultation with the captain, a part of the quarter-deck, covering nearly a third of its extent, was partitioned off, by means of heavy car pets and draperies, so as to form a tent for the re ception of Im-Abdallah and her party ; for, by reason of the warmth and closeness of the atmosphere, the saloon cabins were not pleasant dormitories. Huge U"], [42, "MARIAM chap. 34 packages were brought to it by the black slaves of the party ; these they tore open and drew from them carpets and pillows and couches and curtains, all impregnated with the essences which distil from the attar of roses, and in a short while the interior was endowed with an air of comfort and compara tive luxury. It was open towards the sea, except for the slight intervention of a thin movable curtain which, in the middle of the day, would serve to pro tect them from the heat that was reflected from the shimmering surface of the water, whilst the double awnings of thick canvas which ran along the whole length of the ship would efficiently shield them from that which poured down directly from the burning sun overhead. The countenance of Ismar had, like those of the rest of his party, regained its usual placidity of expression ; and in this pose his features expressed a grave dignity and intelligence, combined with a lurking sense of warmth and geniality, which made it, though not exactly handsome, a pleasant object to look upon, and one which could not fail to be of interest to the thoughtful observer. After he had superintended the construction of the tent on the quarter-deck, and seen that his relatives were com fortably installed therein, he departed thence and exerted himself to become acquainted with the oc cupants of the rest of the upper deck. The whole mass of pilgrims had split up into many groups, who squatted on carpets in close proximity to each other, and prayed, eat, smoked, and drank tea together. Here and there a Bedouin engaged the attention of an admiring circle of townsmen, who listened to his"], [43, "IV MARIAM 35 startling anecdotes \u2014 and a Bedouin has a fine sense of humour, which loses nothing for the perfect air of gravity with which he indulges it \u2014 with awe-struck countenances. Ismar sped from one assembly to the other with a rapidity of motion and an attitude of figure \u2014 bending forwards to hold up the bottom of his magnificent robe, lest it should sweep away the numerous ' narghilehs ' and tea-trays that strewed the deck, with his elbows stuck well backwards \u2014 that was not devoid of a certain tinge of the ludi crous. \" ' Salaam aleikum,' O ye blessed believers !\" he would say. Those addressed would desist from their conver sation, glance upwards at the stranger, who with ingratiating smile was evidently waiting to be asked to sit down. Then : \" ' Aleik-el-salaam,' O thou man of wisdom,\" they would answer readily, \" be welcome ! \" And promptly half a dozen ' narghileh ' tubes, with the saliva still glistening on each mouth-piece, would be held up eagerly for his acceptance. Ismar would thereupon sit down, salaam to the company, accept one of the tubes, salaam again to the owner thereof, wipe the mouth-piece, and straightway suck at it. By this act he became one of themselves. Silence would reign for a few moments, whilst some body promptly set the tea-kettle simmering for his behoof. Then, after a few more compliments had been interchanged and the tea tasted, the conversa tion would resume its channel. Whilst these things were going on the sun set, and, whilst the heat hardly abated, the dazzling sheen of"], [44, "36 MARIAM CHAP. light gave place to the neutral tints of twilight, which is but of short duration in these regions. When the evening gloom deepened, and presently the myriads of golden stars hung over the ship in the immensity of space, Lanxon leant over the stern rails and watched the silvery clouds of foam dashed up from the heaving masses of water agitated by the long arms of the screw, and the thousands of phos phorescent jelly-fish shining like blotches of liquid fire from the troubled depths ; and then his gaze wandered upwards. In northern climes the things that are called stars present so pale and washed-out an appearance that they seldom evoke in us feelings of admiration, far less feelings of reverence. But it is different in Arabia. Here the magnificence of the heavens, by virtue of the peculiar dryness of the atmosphere, is so great that it forcibly absorbs every one of that mixture of feelings that impels a man to fall down and worship. It excites admiration, reverence, awe ; it reveals to the soul its boundless capacities ; it whispers of things that can only be felt. The stars stun his senses with their incomparable brilliancy, with their innumerable myriads. The nearest seems so near, the farthest seems so far! \"If I stretch out my hand,\" he says to himself, \" I shall surely touch this nearest constellation. And if I could but aid myself with its support, I should surely be able to reach the next one above it.\" And so on : each seems so near to the other that any traveller sud denly opening his eyes from the darkness of slumber will surely see a golden ladder reaching upwards from himself into infinity, and all along this ladder twink-"], [45, "MARIAM IV 37 ling angels moving, twinkling graciously on himself : and of the number, perhaps one particularly will attract his attention so that it appears to him as if sent down this ladder for the express purpose of watching over his slumbers and, unseen, over his daily life ; so that he henceforth regards it with a peculiar reverence as the guardian of his life. And high above the strata of distinct and single stars his eye catches the sheen of great silvery masses, visions of transcendent glory. And even beyond these his eye may catch a glimpse of something un utterably majestic, unutterably awful, lying beyond ! From the deep reverie which this sublime spectacle excited in him Christopher Lanxon was recalled to present affairs by sundry noises behind, as of people advancing, and talking, some in tones of deprecation, others in blithe encouragement. It was Ismar ; who, having made the discovery that the wounded man, who hailed from a town which is still famous throughout the East for the musical and poetical accomplishments of its inhabitants, was a skilful impromptu versifier, had persuaded him to come to the quarter-deck and delight the ears of the ladies with a specimen of his art, whilst his own wife and mother-in-law joined the latter inside the tent. The clothing of common facts and ideas in the garb of poetical sentiment is a matter in which Arabs excel, and many amongst them have the power, like the troubadours of old, of achieving such a transforma tion on any theme that may be presented to them at a moment's notice. Still protesting that he lacked fitness for the devoir that was claimed of him, and that the honour of ministering to the amusement of"], [46, "38 MARIAM CHAP. so exalted a company was far beyond the deserts of his skill, the Bagdadi, who was known by the name of Abu-Brahim, or Father of Ibrahim, sat down in cross-legged fashion on a carpet outside the tent with his mandoline, and prepared to develop his romance in words of song ; stimulating the current of his fancy by a few preliminary strokes on the chords. An expectant hush followed this signal, even the crowd in front of the captain's deck-cabin ceasing their low-toned conversations ; whilst the dim light which streamed from the scores of coloured glass lanterns which the pilgrims had hung from under neath the awnings throughout the ship lent to the scene a weird aspect, which seemed to Lanxon sin gularly appropriate to the interest of the moment. Suddenly the poet commenced in low and melodi ous accents, his voice gradually gaining strength as he warmed to his subject, now rising to the strain of enthusiasm, now falling with a sigh to the lowest depths of softness. He chose for his theme a well known episode in the history of the Beni-Kasym, and cunningly around the driest details he weaved an airy web of sentiment, and enlivened the course of historical narrative with interludes descriptive of human love and passion. The rhythm and character of the song, devoid as it was of intrinsic merit, and only serving as the vehicle through which the narra tor transmitted the colouring which surrounded in his own mind the actions and passions which he described, might not have been calculated to win praise from a cultivated musician of the Western school, but was better suited than even a composition of Wagner's to satisfy the cravings of his audience,"], [47, "IV MARIAM 39 the emotional and imaginative features of whose characters now manifested themselves in all their freshness and power. Inside the tent the members of the hareem and their visitors listened at first in perfect silence ; but soon identifying themselves with what they heard, they broke in softly with exclama tions of pity, surprise, anger, and joy. Then, as, with dextrous handling, the poet would carry them right out of themselves with some quick unexpected turn of pathos, no longer could he be heard, but the silence of the night would be broken by sobs, wails, and lamentations. The other pilgrims, who crouched as close to the boundary-line as was possible, and in many instances availed themselves of the gloom to steal higher, were no less enslaved, but followed the rich imaginative narrative with eager eyes that had obviously lost all count of surrounding objects. And the poet's strained and passionate gaze melted into the softness of joy as he saw the thraldom in which he held all listeners. This would have been reward enough, but he did not quit the vicinity of the tent without a profusion of delicately offered presents and heart-felt thanks. . Hardly had the hubbub of voices which succeeded the end of the performance on the quarter-deck died away, than a slight shock made itself felt throughout the Lornadale : the propeller ceased its rapid rhythmic movement and took on a slow, laboured action. The motion of the ship almost entirely came to an end ; she stood higher out of the water; one could feel her grating over some obstruction. She had begun to rasp her way over the sandy bar at the mouth of the Euphrates."], [48, "MARIAM CHAP. 40 Then followed for some moments the sounds of anxious voices, and the scurrying of hasty feet, as the pilgrims, most of whom had lain down with the intention of forgetting for the nonce all earthly concerns, started up and questioned each other concerning this change to the smooth course of their proceedings, or hurried to the ship's sides, and hung over them in ardent but fruitless en deavours to fathom the mystery of the darkness around them. With that resignation to the decrees of Providence which is characteristic of Orientals, they gave vent to various pious ejaculations, and once more disposed themselves to court the oblivion of the night. The captain came aft and presently swung himself into his hammock; and Lanxon, stirred by his example, left his position by the stern-rails with the intention of doing likewise, but had not made two steps when he stumbled over a figure that was squat ting on the deck, apparently engaged in the same wasteful indulgence in reverie which had character ized his own employment of time that night. It was Ismar. Lanxon began to make profuse apologies, but Ismar cut him short. \" Nay, sir,\" he said placidly, \" wherefore trouble yourself for a trifle ? Verily it is a matter of no con sequence.\" Lanxon laughed, and, delaying his original inten tion, sat down beside him. \"You appear to be a philosopher,\" he said. \" That,\" replied Ismar, \" is a compliment which is due more to the kindliness of your feelings than to"], [49, "IV MARIAM 41 my deserts. Still, in face of this grandeur and sub limity of Nature, the mind of man can scarce help paying little heed to the sensations of the body.\" \"You speak well,\" responded Lanxon. \"There is indeed something in our surroundings at the present moment which, I verily believe, would succeed in digging up a man's best thoughts, if even they lay buried beyond the limits of his consciousness.\" \"Nay,\" said Ismar, lightly, \"you enlarge my meaning to an extent that I hesitate to accept. The sum of our surroundings includes things which, 60 far as I am concerned, would hardly conduce to the spirit of philosophy.\" \"Your meaning is not clear to me, O Ismar.\" \" Nay, then, by the life of the Prophet, I will give you a sufficient explanation ! To an Arab the land must ever serve _ as the basis of his calculations; at sea his aspirations are apt to collapse.\" \"That,\" said Lanxon, laughing, \"is not a circum stance altogether peculiar to Arabs. I remember certain unhappy moments when the unsettlement of foundation to which you refer deprived me of all power even to doubt, and made me sublimely in different to everything. Still, look you, there is philosophy in that.\" \" Extremes,\" said Ismar, \" cannot fail to bear some resemblance to each other. In the ideal mood of philosophy you accept all things with equanimity, by reason of your voluntary abstraction of mind ; in the philosophy of sea-sickness the abstraction is involuntary : therein lies the difference. It is even held, I understand, by certain adepts, that the loftiest heights of philosophy may only be attained by arti-"], [50, "MARIAM chap. 42 ficially inducing that extreme depression of animal spirits which is naturally produced by sea-sickness.\" \" Yet for you,\" rejoined Lanxon, \" the thought of sea-sickness should remain but as the shadow of past misfortune ; for, by the exercise incurred in your travels, your constitution has doubtless become inured to the upheavals and declensions of the ocean wave.\" \" To some extent, no doubt,\" said Ismar, \" for which Allah be praised ! Yet the more equable the surface of the ocean, when we find ourselves upon it, the more shall I be disposed to rejoice.\" \"You must have been young,\" continued Lanxon, \" when first you started on your travels ; since, from your appearance, I judge you to have scarce reached the age of thirty.\" \" I am yet a considerable distance from that noble epoch of life,\" replied Ismar, \"and it is now nine years since I landed on your shores and applied myself to the study of your language and your civili zation ; the rumours of which had fired my youthful fancy and impelled me, despite all obstacles, to become better acquainted with it. And scarce a twelvemonth has elapsed since I returned to my people ; amongst whom I am still, indeed, accounted something of a foreigner.\" \"And is your return, then, to Arabia, a permanent one?\" \" Without doubt,\" responded Ismar. \" I could not change my state if I would ; nor, by the Prophet, would I if I could ! \" \"And is it indeed true,\" exclaimed Lanxon, \" that you, having knowledge of both, prefer the stagnant"], [51, "IV MARIAM 43 pool of Eastern to the sparkling current of Western life?\" \"Now, by the Prophet,\" rejoined Ismar, not with out some irritation, \"your comparison savours of narrow-minded prejudice. To a person in the moon, or otherwise so situated as to take a comfortable bird's-eye view of both, no doubt the latter would appear a thing of much greater beauty; but so far as the individual drops of each are concerned, it is a question whether those in the pool have not a better time of it than those in the torrent.\" \"Nay,\" cried Lanxon, \"but consider the comforts, the thousand and one little refinements of Western life.\" Here, all of a sudden, Ismar astonished Lanxon beyond measure by a change that came over him. They were enshrouded in a darkness such that the lineaments of his face were not to be clearly distin guished. One bright lantern burning in the ladies' tent, and a lamp in the captain's deck-cabin, threw but a faint glimmer over the rest of the quarter deck ; and the dim starlight of the heavens did not penetrate beneath the awnings. Yet, by reason of some subtle psychical force which at that moment seemed to invade him and caused him to pause in the midst of his utterance, Lanxon was nevertheless conscious of the change ; intensely conscious, even before Ismar uttered a word. His figure bent itself forward in eagerness. \"The superfluous,\" he began, \" is not the essen tial.\" Here again with equal suddenness he stopped short and, apparently struck with a change of pur pose recovered his ordinary placid humour. His"], [52, "MARIAM CHAP. 44 voice, in uttering these words, had exchanged the light tone in which he had previously conversed for one of depth and earnestness, such as is wont to vibrate from the innermost recesses of a man's being when he is about to speak seriously, and at some length, on a subject which is near to his heart ; and so great had been the expectancy awakened by it in Lanxon that the blank in which it ended affected him with some manner of a shock. Nor did it fail to make him conscious that Ismar, perchance by reason of that instinct of his race which impels even the shallowest-minded Arab to conceal the depths of his feelings from a stranger, was averse to pursue the subject farther. Yet for a moment there had been a revelation of that inner man which it was apparently Ismar's humour to keep in the back ground ; and the emotions of both gave rise to an awkward pause, which Lanxon strove to break presently with the aid of other matter. \" I wonder,\" he said, \" that you determined to perform this journey by sea.\" \" Nay, there is little cause for marvel,\" replied Ismar in a voice which was free from the least trace of agitation ; \" the expedition was only definitely resolved upon a few days since. We have to be in Mecca in twenty-three days, and we could scarce perform the journey in comfort by land in that time. By steam we shall, inshallah, reach our destination some days before the appointed period.\" \" It is not customary, I believe,\" said Lanxon, \" for a young unmarried lady to perform the pil grimage.\" \"A young unmarried lady?\" repeated Ismar."], [53, "IV MARIAM 45 \" How came it to your knowledge that there was such a one ? \" \" I was so informed by the Sheikh's brother,\" replied Lanxon. \" We love not,\" said Ismar, after a pause, \" to talk of our women.\" \" A most unreasonable prejudice,\" muttered Lanxon. \" Nay, my friend,\" exclaimed Ismar, with some tinge of amusement in his voice, \"that must remain a matter of opinion. By the Prophet, it has oft occurred to me that your women would lose little in public estimation were men to hold their tongues somewhat more concerning them in your country ! But in this matter you are right. For certain special reasons, however, which, with your favour, I will not enter upon, we have thought fit to act contrary to the established custom. But here comes the moon, which bids us to forget all earthly cares whilst it sheds its serene light over our slumbers. So I will bid you good-night. Allah have you in his keeping.\" So saying, and with an alacrity that made Lanxon suspect that it was not without a certain satisfaction that he rid himself of so inquisitive a companion, Ismar rose and betook himself to the thick Persian carpet and cushions that had been spread out on the side of the quarter-deck opposite to that on which the tent had been erected and were to form his couch. The moon had indeed risen above the dark masses of palm-forests, and cast a rich mellow light over the quiet expanse around. On the one side could be dimly discerned the outlines of Arabia; on the other those of Persia; between them the old"], [54, "46 MARIAM CHAP. IV and famous river from which they had just issued. The Lornadale stood perfectly still, stuck fast on the bar of the Euphrates ; for the tide had ebbed away and left her high and dry for the next twenty four hours. Lanxon gazed on this scene for a few moments, and then turned and swung himself into his hammock."], [55, "CHAPTER V THE eastern horizon had scarce clothed itself in the tints of the early dawn, when Christopher Lanxon felt himself recalled to consciousness by the sound and bustle which arose from the tent on the quarter deck and assailed his slumbering senses. His ham mock was situated across the half of the quarter deck opposite to that occupied by the ladies, slung high up beneath the awning, close by that of the captain's ; so that his feet lay above the couch which had been occupied by Ismar, whilst his head approx imated towards the middle line of the ship. The sounds were of a varied description. Some one in side the tent appeared to be running her fingers over a stringed instrument, and hummed in a low tone to its accompaniment ; another repeated in a monotone, embellished with appropriate variations, some verses of the Koran ; whilst others in an ante chamber \u2014 which had been constructed by loosely hoisting another carpet to the awning above, from the hindmost corner of the tent to within three feet of the stem-rail \u2014 made preparations for the morn ing meal with much clatter and chatter, and received from the hands of the male slaves the dishes bearing"], [56, "48 MARIAM CHAP. the steaming viands that had been cooked elsewhere : each party of menials, at the same time, indulging their wit at the expense of the other, ofttimes in so acute a manner as to elicit a laugh from those who remained within the tent. Peeping over the edge of his hammock, Lanxon caught sight of Ismar and four others of his party seated on a carpet around a low settee of wood, beautifully inlaid with mother-of-pearl, on which re posed a brass tray bearing several well-filled dishes. A slave carried round an earthenware jar, and a basin and a towel : from the first of which articles he poured water on the hands of each in succession ; and then, with the preliminary formula by way of grace which is customary on similar occasions, they addressed themselves to the work before them. From the dishes direct, each helped himself by means of small flat thin loaves of bread which were rolled up betwixt the fingers and used as a spoon or scoop. Spoons also they had, but no forks or knives : for the latter indeed there being no necessity, as all the victuals were broken up small. It was astound ing in how cleanly a manner their deft fingers man aged to perform the operation ; nor did they exhibit any unseemly haste, but chatted, laughed, and told each other stories. Lanxon examined his watch, and, seeing that it indicated no later an hour than that of five, could not refrain from muttering certain ungracious reflec tions on the inconvenient habits of these new tenants of the quarter-deck, and strove once more to forget them and all other things besides. Complete success in this effort, however, was impossible ; for, though"], [57, "V MARIAM 49 the sounds were low, and whenever the menials threatened, in their good-humour, to become noisy, the voice of Ismar or of some one in the tent would bid them restrain themselves for fear of waking the sleeping Feringhees, yet the tumult was sufficient to prevent anything more than a dreamy languor from stealing over his senses. In this state he was still semi-conscious of the doings around him, as the menials removed the dishes, and brought on the nec essary articles for the indispensable tea-drinking. Then ' narghilehs ' were heard to murmur and bubble, and presently the ladies descended below for the purpose of bathing \u2014 one of the two bath rooms in the saloon having been retained for their exclusive use. Then the sun arose and shot rays of such intensity on to the deck that Lanxon lazily shifted his pillow and shielded his head with it, and, in the silence which had now supervened, dropped off to sleep. Some time after he was hailed by the captain, who was sitting up in his hammock. \" Hullo, doctor ! \" he cried, \" no more sleep this morning, or you will be getting sun-stroke, or heat stroke, or brain-fever. Wake up, my soul, and with the light\u2014 \" But then seeing that the sluggard took no notice of his exhortation, he seized a broom from a passing sailor who was going aft to sweep the quarter-deck, and applied it with such force to the side of the hammock as to cause it to swing violently from side to side, even against the awning above, whilst its at tachments creaked noisily. In a person unaccustomed to hammock-sleeping E"], [58, "MARIAM CHAr. 50 this procedure would have occasioned an immediate displacement of the centre of gravity, resulting in an out-tumbling on to the deck not quite devoid of danger to the delicate structure of the human frame ; nor could such an unaccustomed person, if in the place of an observer, gaze on the sight without ex periencing some tinge of that emotion which over whelms us at the impending destruction of a fellow creature. But when a man has slept constantly in a hammock for some months, and has besides a light and supple body, he becomes so habituated to it, and can so harmonize his own position with the evolu tions that any shock causes it to undergo, as to render him perfectly secure in it, however great the seeming danger, so long as it is not entirely reversed. The doctor therefore treated the captain's word and action with calm indifference. The swinging would help him to sleep. But at this moment there reached his ears a shrill cry of terror and astonishment, uttered in a young and feminine voice. Instantly the pillow was heaved aside, and Lanxon turned over, grappled with the hammock, and, notwithstanding its mad oscillations, succeeded in protruding over its edge his nose preparatory to bringing his eyes to bear on the surrounding scene. The carpet which had been hung up to screen the ante-chamber was only se curely fastened to the tent above ; below it diverged, leaving a fissure which widened gradually to the bottom. Through this fissure he caught the face of a young girl, uncovered and gazing spell-bound at his madly oscillating couch. It was thin and oval ; perfectly black, with soft eyes now opened to their"], [59, "MARIAM V 51 greatest width ; the mouth large, but the lips thin ; and the hair long and plaited. Her figure, as she knelt on the deck, he could see, was slim and in good proportion ; it expressed a state of tension as if in readiness to make a spring. The poor girl had evi dently been frightened out of her wits at seeing the hammock swing about in so uncontrolled a manner, and no doubt expected a catastrophe to happen. Lanxon had hardly time to make these observations when another face appeared above that of the negress, not veiled, but still closely enwrapped by the ' izar ' or shroud so as to expose only a pair of eyes, brown as those of a gazelle, large and wonder fully soft ; but, far from exhibiting any terror, they danced with merriment as soon as they discovered the cause of the other's excitement, and roamed over the hammock until they encountered those of Lanxon, when they instantaneously disappeared. Almost immediately after, the young negress col lapsed, as if she had been pulled forcibly inwards, and a soft voice exclaimed : \" Desist, Wasseefy. Verily, your conduct is worthy of blame ! \" \"Nay,\" exclaimed the other with some petulance, \" lengthen your patience with me ; wherefore are you laughing if I cannot venture to be astonished?\" \" Now, by Allah,\" rejoined Mariam, \" that is not the same. Laughter cannot be repressed when it is excited by the ridiculous ; but it did not make me forget myself.\" Christopher Lanxon sat bolt upright, with that troubled expression which is wont to overcast the features of a man when he suddenly and unexpect-"], [60, "MARIAM CHAP. 52 edly discovers himself in the position of one afford ing merriment to others. Then with unnecessary vehemence he swung himself out of the hammock, and trudged disconsolately below to indulge in the luxury of a bath ; in the enjoyment of which he speedily regained the equanimity of mind which was natural to him. When he returned on deck, Ismar approached him and, after some unimportant conversation, in formed him that the lady Ayesha, the Sheikh's wife, felt indisposed, and desired to have the benefit of his skill. \" Oh \u2014 ah \u2014 yes,\" said Lanxon ; \" I shall be most happy to be of use to her.\" \" Will you, then, send her something to restore her spirits?\" said Ismar. \" But, my friend, I must see her first,\" exclaimed Lanxon. \"Ah \u2014 you must see her,\" repeated Ismar, pen sively. \" Well, I must ask the ladies whether they will admit you into the hareem.\" He went in and spoke to them in low tones. \" In the name of Allah, let him come in without delay,\" ejaculated in surprise a voice that Lanxon recognized as belonging to the sympathetic lady in the black-silk shroud. \"Why should he not, if he will but favour us ? It matters not. We shall be eternally grateful to him. Cover yourselves, my daughter, and you, my sisters.\" Ismar came out and, standing aside, motioned courteously to Lanxon to step in. The latter obeyed. A black slave called Ibrahim stood in the ante-chamber, by the entrance. This man had a"], [61, "MARIAM V 53 peculiar curl of his upper lip, which gave him a pronouncedly fierce, snarling sort of expression. It was no index to his character, for he was of a most gentle, obliging disposition ; having, indeed, already formed a strong attachment for the young doctor, in consequence of the latter's assiduous and success ful attention to the wounded man the day before. He therefore, considering that no man could possibly enter a strange hareem without experiencing an overwhelming perturbation of his mental faculties, tried to do what he could towards cheering Lanxon and sustaining his spirits by bending towards him, as he passed, in a benignant fashion, and expanding his features into what was intended to be a grin of encouragement. But the result was so horrible that Lanxon, who had hitherto been perfectly master of himself, shivered with a suddenly aroused sensation of fright, and passed into the sacred precincts with all his senses scattered. The circle of veiled, mute figures that now encountered his eyes was not a sight calculated to restore his faculties. But one amongst them was a patient ; and when Ibrahim had pointed the suffering one out to him, he felt himself at once master of the situation, and advanced towards the patient with that sense of importance which never fails to come over a doctor in such cir cumstances and renders him invulnerable to all other influences. Once before the bowed figure of the lady Ayesha, Lanxon squared his shoulders, held up his head, and, after gazing around the assembly in a complacent sort of manner, proceeded to question the patient on the sensations produced by her ail ment."], [62, "MARIAM CHAP. 54 \" Pain \u2014 I have pain everywhere,\" she murmured. \" Let me see your face,\" suggested Lanxon, \" then I can see what is the matter with you.\" But the patient only shook her head. \" Well, then,\" said Lanxon, \" let that pass, and show me only your tongue.\" This she did, lifting up a corner of the veil for the purpose. \" Now,\" he continued, \" I must see your eyes \u2014 one by one \u2014 that will do.\" She successively uncovered each side of her face. \" Well,\" said Lanxon, who was now quite at ease, \"you see that you have shown me the whole of your face, which was what I asked you to do at first. Do you feel any the worse for it ? \" A happy inspiration impelled him to make the remark ; it proved fortunate in its effect, and Lanxon at once became a ' persona grata ' in the hareem. The ice broke, a ripple of soft laughter rose from behind the veils, and even the lady Ayesha smiled. \" No,\" she said ; \" nor, indeed, do I feel any bet ter.\" \" Nay,\" rejoined Lanxon ; \" but, with the aid of Heaven, I will insure that presently.\" \" May Allah's graciousness to you equal your deserts ! \" replied the lady. \" It would ill beseem me to speak of a gratitude that could not fail to fall short of its mark for want of adequate powers of expression.\" Lanxon salaamed and was on the point of making his way out of the tent, when he w7as arrested by the voice of Im-Abdallah, who proceeded to ask him"], [63, "MARIAM V 55 \u25a0 a variety of questions concerning the ship and the voyage ; so that presently he found himself engaged in a conversation in which several of the other in mates of the hareem took part : nor, in spite of the veil, was it difficult for him to determine which was the young lady whom the Sheikh's brother had mentioned to him, and concerning whom Ismar had, the previous evening, shown a desire to remain silent. But the tones of her voice seemed instinct with a sense of subdued humour which recalled to his mind the laugh which had recently upset his equanimity. Somewhat disturbed by this memory, he availed himself of the first opportunity that offered for putting an end to the conference, and, with a profound salaam, withdrew from the tent, and hastened below to prepare the potion with which he proposed to remedy the slight indisposition which had come over the lady Ayesha. As the morning passed and noon approached, the stillness deepened throughout the Lornadale, and each individual pilgrim, whether of high or low degree, dropped into that midday siesta which is an appropriate custom in these climes ; for, un pleasant as is the leaden-hued cast of the heavens which, with us, so often damps the anticipations of youth and maidens eager for association in the gentle exercise of tennis or a sylvan ramble, it is still less so than the ardent glare which burns the waters of the Persian Gulf on a summer's day. Captain Polwarth, whose chief enjoyment in life lay in the sailing of boats, took advantage of the enforced idleness of his ship \u2014 which would not be able to move till the coming of the evening tide \u2014 to indulge"], [64, "56 MARIAM CHAP. his hobby, and departed with three grumbling men and the cabin-boy, to court the favours of a breeze the existence of which to everybody else seemed very much a matter of conjecture. Christopher Lanxon, after successfully evading the captain's attempt to engage him in sharing his enterprise, laid himself down on a wicker couch on the quarter-deck ; thus securing, with commendable wisdom, a com fortable position in which to surrender himself to the narcotic influences with which the atmosphere seemed laden. The heat, indeed, was so great that it not merely obliterated thought, but even memory ; and he caught himself wondering in a dazed manner at certain shreds of past remembrances that moved here and there for a moment amidst the dead calm which had settled over his mind ; for such was the influence of time and place that they appeared to him wholly disjointed from each other and, in par ticular, having no connection with himself. He was aroused from this lethargy, after an uncer tain interval, by a touch on his shoulder, and beheld Ismar standing beside him. \"Look yonder,\" said the latter, \"see \u2014 the cap tain's boat ! \" Lanxon looked in the direction indicated, but could see nothing but a tiny speck. \" Well, what is the matter with it ? \" he inquired. \" Mashallah ! don't you see ? The sail is down, the boat is motionless. Do they mean to be burnt up by this broiling sun ? It is wonderful ! \" Lanxon leapt up and obtained a pair of glasses from the captain's deck-cabin. With them he verified Ismar's observation. The chief mate and"], [65, "V MARIAM 57 the steward were both standing by, so he handed them the glasses and told them what he had seen. \" They are rowing,\" cried the steward. \" Ay, that's so,\" returned the mate. \" What in the name of creation are they doing that for ? I pity the poor devils who are lathering away under this blazing sun ! \" \" Perhaps the mast is broken,\" suggested Lanxon. \" Ay, that must be it,\" cried the mate, excitedly. \"And won't the captain be in a tearing passion when he gets on board again ! \" \" Well, it's nobody's fault, I suppose,\" remarked Lanxon. \" No matter about that,\" said the mate, laughing. \" Look here, Mr. Lamsden,\" cried the steward, \" this won't do. They will never be able to fetch here. There are only four men in the boat \u2014 and one of them a boy \u2014 besides the captain ! \" \" Well, I am not denying they'll have to work for it.\" But why not send them a boat ? \" \" Send them a boat, ye soft-headed fool ? \" cried Mr. Lamsden in a passion. \" D'ye see the run of the tide ? Why, it would take ten men longer to get where they are now than it will those four to fetch here! \" The steward turned away in high dudgeon, and gave vent to his feelings presently by ringing a clamorous clatter on the bell, which notified to the surgeon, the mates, and the chief engineer the readiness of the dinner, which, in the opinion of all, had already been too long postponed. The afternoon was already far advanced by the"], [66, "58 MARIAM CHAP. time this meal was over ; and after another short lounge and a smoke on the quarter-deck Lanxon arose with the intention of taking a stroll round the ship. The aspect of things had changed ; for, the great heat of the day being somewhat on the wane, the pilgrims were rousing themselves up in readiness for social pleasures, whilst here and there a pious group devoted itself to the elaborate ritual of wor ship enjoined by the creed of Islam, in solemn silence and perfect rhythm and unison. Visitors came to pay their respects to the ladies in the tent on the quarter-deck ; voices ran in a continual chat ter, narghilehs bubbled and tea-kettles simmered. Tea-parties were a great institution amongst these pilgrims \u2014 indeed, they appeared to be drinking tea all their waking moments ; so that special boards had to be fixed about, whereon they might set their coal-braziers without the danger of burning through the decks. But in making the tea they never allowed the boiling water to stand for any length of time over the leaves, but poured it off almost at once, so that the resulting fluid contained all their aromatic but little or none of their tonic ingredients ; and by this means they escaped the evil consequences which might have otherwise attended their constant re course to this beverage. On the decks, in the open, the men had their tea-parties, groups of four or five congenial spirits, who squatted together, prayed to gether, discussed philosophy and religion together, smoked together, and finally drank tea together. In their impromptu tents the women had their tea parties ; some receiving, others visiting, drinking tea, and chatting on every conceivable subject for per-"], [67, "V MARIAM 59 haps twenty minutes and then trotting off to repeat the operation elsewhere. In these journeys they were carefully veiled ; but in the tents they un covered themselves and were as free and easy as any reasonable being could wish. They had plenty of society: colourless, of course, from one point of view, considering the absence of men from it; but they did not appear to suffer from the want. There were at least thirty or forty women on board, belong ing to every class of their society; and it could not but astonish a Western observer to see how easily they mixed together and became assimilated. The ladies of the quarter-deck, for example, were prin cesses : possessing authority over many thousands of human beings, wealthy and descended from families that had been noble for many hundreds if not thousands of years ; yet here they sat on the same carpet with the wife of Hassan, the lowly tin merchant of Bussorah, and conversed as equals with Amina, the wife of Abdallah, the milk-carrier of Bagdad. Yet, though perhaps hardly conscious of it themselves, every word that these women uttered was instinct with the respect and deference that was due to the high birth of their hostesses. So likewise amongst the men, an individual in the poorest of clothing might be seen squatting next to one in a robe of fine texture, and pledging him in a cup of tea ; nor did wealth appear in any degree to raise barriers betwixt man and man. The sight of Abu-Brahim, \u2014 who, it will be remem bered, had well-nigh lost his life at the very outset of his pilgrimage, \u2014 sitting in company with a number of Bedouins, arrested Lanxon's attention. The poet"], [68, "60 MARIAM CHAr. was talking boastfully, evidently trying to impress his listeners with the idea that he was as doughty a man of war as any one of them. He tried to explain the incident of his fall. \" You see,\" he said, \" it was a slipper. Now, by Allah, if I had used a slipper \u2014 \" \" Now, then, father of a beard,\" said one of his audience, contemptuously, \" don't brag ! Verily, I had my eyes on you, and my ears were likewise not at fault. At one moment you were battering my head with your slippers as though you thought it were a tom-tom.\" This rejoinder, uttered by one who had been listening to him hitherto with every appearance of good faith, so unsettled Abu-Brahim's equanimity of mind that he relapsed into silence, whilst his eyes wandered around in an uncertain manner. Be coming in this wise conscious of Lanxon's presence, he sprang up with alacrity, joyous at finding so near to hand a means of covering a retreat which ap peared to him urgent, and addressing him courteously, besought him to honour his domicile with a visit ; in particular as his wife had expressed herself anxious to thank Lanxon in person for his kindness on the previous day. Lanxon experienced some astonish ment at this invitation, but hastened to express in the same courteous language the pleasure that he would derive from compliance with it, and followed Abu-Brahim to a small tent which had been rigged up on the after-half of the upper deck. The interior of this tent, though not so luxuriously appointed as that on the quarter-deck, yet presented so per fect a picture of order and cleanliness that a"], [69, "MARIAM 61 single glance sufficed to convince Lanxon that its presiding genius was a good housewife; nor did a further acquaintance make it appear that she failed in any of the other qualities which a man desires to find in the companion of his bosom. She could not have been more than eighteen or nineteen years of age, and the two folds of thin muslin loosely disposed, one above and one below the eyes, rather enhanced than concealed the appearance of the sharp-cut and determined lineaments of the oval countenance, offering that contrast to the soft and languishing eyes which is so constant a feature in Moorish and other forms of loveliness derived from Arabia. Without abusing the courtesy which had admitted him into these precincts, by taking too exact an in ventory of the charms thus revealed to his gaze, Lanxon nevertheless saw enough to cause him to pay an involuntary and silent tribute to the happiness of his host. She sat in cross-legged fashion \u2014 and the lithe and supple figure appeared none the less grace ful in this position, though it would scarcely suit the rigid appliances which enter into the dress of her Western sisters \u2014 in front of her tea-set, with her mother by her side ; and as her husband brought in the visitor, she welcomed him with a smile, and begged him to make himself at home, with that Arabic term 'tfaddal,' for which there is no suffi cient equivalent in the English language, and assured him that she and her household would consider his presence amongst them an honour which she hoped he would not refrain from according them as often as he might find it convenient ; letting it be inferred rather from her manner than from her words that"], [70, "62 MARIAM CHAr. they felt themselves under a sense of obligation. Then with evident pride in the satisfactory perform ance of her functions, as both Lanxon and Abu- Brahim sat down on the carpet opposite her in cross-legged fashion \u2014 the former being laughingly supplied by the mother-in-law with a cushion to render that unaccustomed posture somewhat more practicable for him \u2014 she dispensed the aromatic beverage in thin small tumblers, sweetened to a high degree, and with the customary slice of lemon or young lime floating on its surface in place of milk , first of all sipping each with her own lips, and bow ing her head with a complimentary expression to the receiver, who thereupon salaamed and returned the compliment in similar flowery language, with an addition that implied the gratitude that filled his or her bosom for the gracious favour. \" Indeed, O Abu-Brahim,\" said Lanxon, \" you have wherewithal to content your spirit ! \" \" Ha ! Allah is merciful ! \" rejoined the other with a complacent gesture. \" Who am I that I should not be content with my lot ? In Bagdad I have a house \u2014 by Allah it is a good house, and pretty, with furniture.\" \"And I,\" said his spouse, \"have two children \u2014 by Allah, they are good children, and worthy of all kindness.\" \" You have left them behind you ? \" said Lanxon. \" Even so,\" she replied, with an affirmative ges ture ; \" with my sister in Bagdad, who has children of her own and knows how to take care of them. It were not fit that we should expose them to the risks of such a voyage \u2014 by Allah, it were an act devoid of wisdom to do so.\""], [71, "MARIAM 63 V \" That has been the way we have managed on each previous occasion,\" explained Abu-Brahim. \"You have, then, performed the pilgrimage be fore?\" said Lanxon. \" By Allah, yes,\" rejoined Abu-Brahim. \"This is the third time that my wife and I have undertaken this commendable journey; and this time we are taking her mother with us.\" \" You are great travellers,\" said Lanxon. \" Nay, by Allah, not over-much,\" rejoined Abu- Brahim, with a gesture of deprecation. \" But I have been likewise to Damascus.\" \"That was before our marriage,\" said Im-Brahim. \" But he has promised to take me some day, and I purpose availing myself of that promise at no distant period.\" \" Inshallah, O Leila ! \" returned her husband. \" Is it not written by the illustrious Mohamed el-Mekri, in the book entitled ' Resplendent Jewels from the Mines of Philosophy,' that 'patience ultimately never fails towin its reward ' ? \" \" I have likewise been to Damascus,\" said Lanxon. \" Have you \u2014 -by Allah?\" ejaculated Leila, or Im- Brahim as she was entitled to be called, regarding Lanxon with a considerable increase of interest ; for ever since the Prophet, as tradition has it, turned away his eyes from that city lest its surpassing beauty, as he viewed it in the light of the waning sun from the summit of Salahieh, should divert his thoughts from the Celestial Paradise, Damascus has been to Easterns very much more than what Paris is to Americans ; nor would his account of a visit to any city in Europe have appeared in her eyes of"], [72, "64 MARIAM CHAP. equal importance. \" Did you not find it a place of exceeding loveliness ? \" Lanxon hastened to satisfy the curiosity of his hostess by an account of such particulars concern ing the city in question as he conceived would prove most interesting to her, to which both Leila and her mother listened with various and frequent ejacu lations of wonder and appreciation ; whilst Abu- Brahim solemnly nodded his head in corroboration of each succeeding sentence. Having thus enter tained his new acquaintances for the space of some minutes, Lanxon arose and bade them farewell for the time with the customary expressions of good will that are strictly enjoined by Eastern etiquette. On returning to the quarter-deck, Lanxon encoun tered the black slave Ibrahim, who hailed his appear ance with an extraordinary display of satisfaction. Close to him, beside the saloon gangway, two other inferior menials squatted on the deck on either side of a large brass tray covered with a profusion of many-coloured fruits. Melons, pomegranates, and mangoes formed the base of the pile ; over these were heaped plums, apricots, peaches, bananas, figs, and apples; and above all, drooping over the rest, heavy bunches of dates and grapes. At sight of Lanxon the two slaves sprang to their feet, and, lift ing the tray between them, waited in silence, \" El Hamdulilah ! \" exclaimed Ibrahim. \" By Allah, we have been considerably puzzled to make out what had become of your honour; nor did our attempt to find you prove of any avail.\" \"What is this about?\" exclaimed Lanxon with considerable wonder."], [73, "V MARIAM 65 \" Nay, a matter of little consequence,\" rejoined Ibrahim with a gesture of disparagement \u2014 \" a slight offering from the ladies of the Emir. If you will indicate a place where they may deposit them, they will do so.\" \" Is the wife of the Emir, then, better in spirits ? \" \" By Allah, she is indeed \u2014 praise be to Allah ! \" \" Praise be to Allah ! \" echoed Lanxon. \" Well, then, good Ibrahim, run and present my compli ments to the ladies, and assure them of my satisfac tion at your news ; nor let them deem me insensible to their graciousness.\" With these words he called to the steward to take charge of the tray, and joined Ismar, who was sitting on his carpet and placidly enjoying his narghileh. \" The captain is late,\" said Lanxon. \" He is approaching \u2014 but slowly,\" said Ismar. \" The sooner he is here the better,\" said Lanxon. \" The sun will soon be setting, and the tide will be presently reaching its height. If he come not on board soon, we shall have to spend another day in this position.\" \" Nay \u2014 Allah forbid ! \" said Ismar, hastily. At this moment Ibrahim came out of the tent carrying another brass tray of smaller dimensions, with two tiny tumblers filled with the gold-brown decoction of which Lanxon had already partaken in Abu-Brahim's tent. These he presented to Ismar and Lanxon with suitable greetings from the ladies who sent them. Soon after, the captain's boat, which had already been for some moments past the mark of many eyes \u2014 partly because of the pity which the poor F"], [74, "66 MARIAM CHAP. creatures who had been compelled to endure the torrid rays of the cruel sun throughout those length ened hours inspired, and partly by reason of a circum stance which lay somewhat out of the ordinary, and which, amongst the community imprisoned on board the Lornadale, could not fail to excite considerable comment \u2014 touched the ship's side. The boat con tained a stranger besides the company which had that morning left the decks of the Lornadale. He was an Arab with a noble bearing, and a bearded face unquestionably handsome, whilst the texture of his cloak seemed to denote a social position of conse quence and the possession of some wealth. Yet the glance that he cast around him as he landed on the deck of the Lornadale, and with which he returned the gaze of curiosity that everyone who was nigh at hand regarded him with, contained that which marred, to a considerable extent, the previous effect of his prepossessing appearance. For it was instinct with that expression which in minor degrees some times indicates a noble and praiseworthy independ ence of the opinion of others, but not infrequently covers at bottom an utter contempt for the very principles on which public opinion is grounded. One could not say for certain whether in this man's mind the balance inclined to one side or to the other ; but there was enough to raise a doubt, even at first sight ; and when that is so, considering the powers of dissimulation which all men who are clever enough to be dangerous possess, wisdom is justified in insisting on a certain margin being al lowed in the estimation of a character sufficient to include all possible developments."], [75, "MARIAM 67 V The stranger made his way quickly to the fore part of the vessel, with a bundle which he had brought with him ; whilst Lanxon addressed himself to the captain. \" Your expedition was not a success,\" he said. \" Nay, it was but a wight job altogether,\" replied Captain Pohvarth, dejectedly. \" What with the mast breaking, and that cabin-boy forgetting to put the water-barrel into the boat, we had a nice time of it.\" \" And where did you pick up your new pas senger ? \" \" Oh, he came in a boat from off the shore. It appears he missed the ship at Fau, where he was awaiting her ; and so came along to board her whilst she was detained on the bar. Now, then, steward, hurry up with something to drink, and don't be such a long while about it.\""], [76, "CHAPTER VI The rapidity with which cure had followed Lanxon's treatment of the slight attack of indigestion which had troubled Ayesha won for him a good deal of admiration, and for her a feeling approaching in some measure to jealousy amidst the other members of the hareem. During the night and in the early morning Ayesha had been a pitiable creature, bowed down and wretched under the weight of her indis position, and troublesome to the rest by reason of her depressing ejaculations. But six hours later she was radiant with health, brimming over with the de sire to speak, and indeed far livelier than her com panions. Whilst they had afternoon tea, and visitors flocked in to pay their respects from the other tents on board, the Healing Art formed the sole subject of conversation ; and Ayesha, by reason of her late experience, took upon herself airs and assumed the position of an authority on the subject : which was utterly impregnable, for few of them had ever been ill, and certainly none had enjoyed the advantages that she had. To every new-comer she repeated the tale with ever-enlarging comments and embellish ments : which naturally caused such exasperation"], [77, "CHAP. VI MARIAM 69 that forthwith each was seized with a desire to suffer in the same way ; and Lanxon soon found plenty of work provided for him. The next morning Wasseefy woke up and, declaring that she had a pain in her right eye, commenced to groan ; and on Ayesha's pronouncing her a humbug \u2014 since there was nothing to be seen the matter with it \u2014 she closed the affected optic with a spasmodic contraction of the eyelids which gave her a most ludicrous appearance, and made her mistress, the young lady whom they called Mariam, cry out for Ibrahim to bring the doctor. This relieved the spasm effectually, for, though Was seefy contemplated posing as a heroine, she had not included as one of the necessary qualifications for such a position the swallowing of medicine. She retaliated, however, by declaring that Mariam looked frightfully ill. This was not the fact, and Mariam indignantly told her to hold her tongue. But Wasseefy gravely persisted until Im-Abdallah's motherly solicitude was finally awakened, and later on, despite her daughter's protestations, she sent for Lanxon, and commanded her to unveil herself. Lanxon was hardly prepared for the fascinating picture which was now presented to his view. It was hard to define where exactly the fascination lay, whether in the face, or in the exquisitely rounded and supple figure that half sat up, half reclined against a pile of cushions. For, though scarcely more than seventeen years of age, the genial influ ence of a southern sun had ripened the charms of Mariam's form to a degree very nigh their limit of perfection. It revealed in some subtle manner the voluptuousness of womanhood, and yet retained in"], [78, "MARIAM CHAP. 70 its subdued refinement the delicacy in outline of maidenhood. In its curves there appeared nothing exaggerated or coarse, but just a sufficiency of de velopment to excite in the mind of an observer that feeling of satisfaction, mingled with something deeper, something akin to reverence, with which one regards the mysteriously beautiful. It beto kened a natural and healthy development and a per fect freedom from any artificial restraint. And her costume, in its simplicity and the ease with which it moulded itself to the figure, but faintly disguising the symmetry of each part, was eminently calculated to enhance its general charm. A long robe of white muslin besprinkled with a few coloured flowers wrapped itself close around her person, secured about the waist by a Bagdad belt of thick white silk interwoven with gold thread, about one inch and a half broad. This robe descended to the neighbour hood of the ankles ; and above the belt, the edges, approaching each other from the shoulders, formed a small V-shaped cleft in which could be seen pro jecting just the curved borders of a short jacket of violet-coloured silk, and underneath these a vest of darker material spotted with white. Below, her ankles were encircled by the voluminous folds of wide pantaloons of the same material as the vest. Out of these folds peeped her feet, bare, but as well cared for as her hands, and indeed of a much fairer hue. On the face there still lingered a shade of annoy ance as Lanxon entered the enclosure, and hostility sparkled in those eyes which, when he had seen them before, had expressed such intense merriment."], [79, "MARIAM VI 71 They were wonderful eyes, large and brown as those of a gazelle, with sensitive pupils that dilated and contracted with each varying emotion, and a pene- trable softness behind that filled an observer with some sense of the hidden depth of feeling that they were prepared, when occasion demanded, to flash out. They looked at Lanxon boldly, with an hon- est boldness devoid of the least tinge of immodesty \u2014 the boldness of eyes that had never, by reason of the veil that protected them, to lower themselves before anybody. Indeed, as he gazed into those fountains of liquid light, there seemed to him to add itself to the rest a fresh spark, that glimmered but feebly, it is true, as if ensconced within the pro- soundest recesses of the illumined strata, but yet was sufficient to distress him, for it had in it the twinkle of humour, born, no doubt, of a fleeting recollection of the incident of the hammock. The complexion was burnt to a light olive-brown hue, with a delicate flush of pink mantling in the cheeks, and a deep shade of crimson staining the exquisite lips, which, full and soft in their centres, curved themselves at their extremities into a perfect Cupid's bow. The whole face was oval, the chin round and dimpled, and the nose well shaped. Over her head she had hurriedly thrown a brown camoline cloak or shroud, \u2014 which she always afterwards wore on board in stead of the silk ' izar,' \u2014 so that it loosely framed her whole figure in and entirely hid from view her jet-black hair with the exception of a few incorri gible strands, that coursed in waving lines across her features and gave her a most piquant air of untidi ness."], [80, "MARIAM CHAP. 72 There was nothing the matter with her : it required but little technical skill to make that discovery. The first glance convinced Lanxon that she was worthy to pose as the very incarnation of blooming health. As soon as he had given utterance to this thought, and declared that there was no necessity whatever for medicine, Mariam's eyes lost their hostile expression and beamed on him with great friendliness. She laughed at Wasseefy, and threw out some hints con cerning her complaint which made her countenance grow haggard with terror lest the doctor should think fit to treat her. The Lornadale was now gliding swiftly over the tranquil and shimmering surface of the Persian Gulf towards Bushire. With the anxious persistence of minds who find themselves in the midst of a novel adventure and know not what to expect from each succeeding moment, the inmates of the hareem again plied Lanxon with a budget of questions of a charac ter very similar to that of the day before. Rumours of the bad weather in store for them had apparently reached their ears, and made them very apprehensive concerning the near future : for the sea to them was a thing utterly unknown, whose anger must be some thing beyond conception in its horror, since even its smiles were not over-pleasant. The lady Ayesha engaged in a lengthy and somewhat vehement de bate on this subject with Lanxon, and appeared to think \u2014 with a certainty, however, which betrayed signs of growing milder as the moments flew7 on \u2014 that the Prophet and the magnanimous Ali, that type of all true chivalry and honour, would quiet the waves and soothe the winds on their behalf. But"], [81, "MARIAM VI 73 Lanxon persisted in grimly and somewhat thought lessly asserting that, since the monsoon was at the present time blowing over the Arabian Ocean, they were bound to experience its violence as soon as they passed the headland Ras-el-Had, which sepa rates the latter from the Gulf of Oman, notwith standing every possible effort of both Mohamed and his beloved son-in-law ; nor could his tones fail, finally, in considerably shaking, if not wholly de stroying, the optimism with which her faith in these beings enabled her to regard the future. At length she gave way entirely, and bowed her head in agi tated sorrow over her bosom and gave vent to a horrified wail. \" O my beloved home ! when shall I behold you again ? When shall the time come when I may see the sun pouring floods of light upon your quarters, ripening the heavy date-bunches hanging from your trees? By the life of the Prophet, I am laid low with trouble ! You are like an enchanted spot ! Your fields are luxuriant gardens ! Your earth of various colours resembles a block of rose-coloured amber ! Allah guide me in my present wander ings ! \" Such were the expressions which escaped from her lips in disjointed fashion, whilst her manner be trayed every manifestation of a distress so genuine and overwhelming that no one who gazed on her could avoid sharing it to some degree on her own account ; and whilst the other women mingled their sympathy with her sorrowful ejaculations, Lanxon, regretting exceedingly his thoughtless pro cedure, which he had hitherto regarded as an amuse-"], [82, "MARIAM CHAP. 74 ment and not at all likely to produce such serious effects, endeavoured to allay her apprehensions by making light of the turbulence of the waves, and vaunting the steadiness and the trustworthiness of the Lornadale, which was indeed a much nobler ship than is usually employed for the carrying of pilgrims. \" And consider, O wife of my uncle,\" said Mariam, \" we are yet on a sea as calm as the river. Allah is merciful ! It is not becoming to create evils before their proper time.\" But Ayesha, who was possessed of an exceedingly emotional temperament, would not be comforted ; and Lanxon, perceiving that sympathy acted on it very much in the same way as an acid does on an alkaline carbonate \u2014 creating a greater effervescence the more there is added \u2014 finally arose and quitted the tent. As he did so he perceived Ismar, who had been all this while absent in some other part of the ship, coming towards him. He gazed on the approaching figure of this individual with a considerable increase of interest, for the knowledge of Mariam's personal appearance had given rise in his mind to a thought concerning Ismar : a thought which appeared in some measure to throw light on his reticence when, the first night of their acquaintance, the conversation had turned on her. For it seemed absurd to Lanxon that Ismar, who had resided so long in Europe, should have remained a slave to what could not but appear to himself, at the very least, an un reasonable prejudice. But the beauty and general attractiveness of Mariam seemed to afford another explanation of the circumstance : and in this light"], [83, "MARIAM VI 75 Ismar's conduct did not differ very greatly from that Avhich might have been expected from any other man in his position. Whilst he Avas making these reflections concerning Ismar, he did not fail to perceive that the latter, even Avhilst approaching him, appeared on his part to regard him someAvhat askance. HoAvever, Avhen they met, it was not on this subject, or on anything in the remotest way akin to it, that Ismar spoke. \"My friend,\" he said, \"the pilgrims have been questioning me concerning the Avashing of the decks.\" \" Well, Avhat about that ? \" said Lanxon. \" It is not possible to Avash the decks Avhilst all these people are lodged on them Avith their carpets and other furniture.\" \" But,\" said Ismar, \" they offer to remove ah things belonging to them from the decks, so that they may be washed.\" \"What?\" \" There is no harm in that.\" \" Do you mean Avhat you say ? \" said Lanxon. seriously. \" Even so,\" returned the other. \" Well, the captain w7ill be overjoyed.\" Presently Captain Polwarth received the message, Avhich astonished him no less than Lanxon. He at once gave the necessary orders. With that Ismar ran forward, hoisted himself on to a barrel amidships, and called out in a loud voice : \" Ho ! O ye blessed believers ! The magnanimous captain has signified his agreement to having the"], [84, "76 MARIAM CHAT. decks Avashed. So pull up all your furniture \u2014 your carpets, and mats, and mattresses, and coverlets, and narghilehs, and tea-pots and tea-kettles, and every thing else that ye may have laid out for your en joyment ; and gather them together on to elevated spots, out of the Avay of the Avater, so that good may be done Avithout harm ensuing. And take you also to yourselves brooms and brushes, and aid the Feringhee sailors in their arduous endeavours, and scrub the Avooden boards, so that they glow Avith a polish sufficient to reflect the splendour of your countenances therein ; and become worthy to sus tain the forms of the chosen people of Allah ! \" Then there arose a shout from many tongues, crying: \"Praise be to Allah, and to Mohamed his Prophet, and to Ali ! In the name of Allah, O thou man of great Avisdom and influence, Ave rejoice in thy Avords, and shall act according to them ! \" And the next moment the decks became a scene of indescribable confusion. Ruthlessly they broke up the cosy quarters that each had taken so much trouble in making comfortable, and, all the while laughing, singing, praying, and yelling, they shifted their belongings onto safe eminences. Then the boatsAvain came along, the Avater-hose in his hands, and a quid of tobacco in his cheek. Four listless sailors folloAved with brooms and made a shoAV of scrubbing the decks. But the pilgrims came with their long brooms and their hand-brushes and set to Avork in eager earnest. Those Avho had no brooms nor hand-brushes capered about with their gOAvns tucked up around their Avaists, splashing through the rushing Avater in great glee, and encouraging the"], [85, "VI MARIAM 77 Avorkers Avith precepts from the Koran. Four of them Avrenched the brooms out of the hands of the sailors ; the latter, nothing loth, alloAved them to do the Avork, and took themselves fonvard. Once there threatened a fight. The boatsAvain, careless or ignorant, had discharged a dark-coloured volley of filthy fluid on to one of the hatches, which alighted on a tea-kettle. Instantly a long-bearded Bagdadi, the OAvner thereof, uttered a yell of mingled anger and defiance, and showering curses on the boat- SAvain's head, fleAV at his throat. But Ismar threAV himself betAveen, pulled aAvay the Bagdadi, and him self, small as he Avas, dragged the boatsAvain toAvards the quarter-deck ; Avhilst the Bagdadi, seizing the kettle Avhich had been so defiled, spat on it in dis gust and threAV it overboard. The captain came running up, SAVore lustily at the boatsAvain, and apolo gized in a laughing manner to Ismar, Ali, and the Bagdadi. \"Allah! Allah!\" said Ismar, angrily, \"this is no laughing matter. If much more of this sort of thing occurs, you will have your throats cut before you reach Jeddah. We are proud creatures, and not accustomed to endure insults meekly. And this was one of the foulest insults that man could have offered. Look at them ! \" And he pointed to the crowd of pilgrims around them, Avho Avith grim silence and loAvering looks Avere Avatching the group. The captain thereupon promised that the boat- SAvain should be logged ; and on this assurance Ismar succeeded in pacifying the enraged multitude. Later on, as Ismar Avas accompanying the doctor"], [86, "78 MARIAM CHAP. VI on his afternoon round of inspection, and they were standing on the fore-deck, he pointed forward into the distance. \" Bushire,\" he said. \"Is it so?\" cried Lanxon. \"I must take your Avord for it. I can sec nothing more than a speck which seems to float on a mist.\" But it proved to be Bushire, the chief seaport of Persia ; the governor of which rejoices in the proud title of Lord of the Sea. As a matter of fact it is 3 ruinous place of about tAventy thousand inhabitants. On account of the dangerous shalloAvs and reefs that surround Bushire, the Lornadale had to anchor nearly seven miles aAvay from it. No one Avas alloAved to land. They had only to embark a further contingent of tAvo or three hundred Persian pilgrims, and then resume their Avay. The anchor rattled down, and the ship brought up. From afar a numerous fleet of ' dhoAvs ' could be seen setting off from the land toAvards them. Silence prevailed everywhere. Down in the deep clear Avater the monstrous sharks amused themselves in chasing shoals of small fish ; hiding themselves one moment, darting forth at another in joyful pursuit. It looked cool and pleasant enough for a shark in those depths, but too warm for any other living creature."], [87, "CHAPTER VII The vast majority of the pilgrims embarked at Bushire Avere Persians ; grave, respectable person ages Avith long beards, mostly dyed to a reddish tint, imposing turbans, floAving robes, and spotless linen. The Avomen appeared even more scrupulous in matter of etiquette and propriety than their sisters Avho Avere already on board ; shy and reserved in demeanour, quiet and soft in tone of voice. But with them there also came certain strange-looking individuals, wild and unkempt in appearance, Avith long uncombed hair falling about their shoulders; eyes, large and hard, gazing at everything they saAV about them Avith the startled look of a child or untutored savage ; harsh voices that, at times, ut tered a language that no one understood. Whence they came was not very definite : some said from Beluchistan, some from Kurdistan, some from Merv, some from Bokhara. In the midst of the polished Persians, the erect and dignified Arabs, the urbane tradesmen of Bagdad and Bussorah, they looked uncouth objects. They took up their quarters in the fore-part of the upper deck. The ice once broken, Lanxon found himself ad-"], [88, "80 MARIAM CHAT. mitted to terms of considerable intimacy with the ladies on the quarter-deck ; nor did they trouble to veil themselves any more in his presence. It is a common experience that days at sea are very much longer in duration, and afford many more opportu nities of acquaintance, by reason of the limits which are set to the AA7anderings of a passenger on board a ship, than the same period of time on land ; nor must the croAvding of events and the rapid growth of feelings which are portrayed in this narrative of a three Aveeks' voyage occasion surprise. Moreover, the sea is so neutral with regard to associations, that on its bosom the barriers which on land rigidly sep arate people and classes and nations lose half their substance ; and whilst, on the one hand, the ladies Avere influenced, by the character of their surround ings, to relax in some measure the strict observance of their code of etiquette, on the other Christopher Lanxon Avas enabled, by the same circumstances, to enter into the spirit of a society Avhich Avas so new to him Avith far greater ease than Avould haA7e been the case on shore. Nor is it to be Avondered at, con sidering the peculiar bent of his mind, Avhich made the study of the various manifestations of human nature his chief delight, that he availed himself Avith great freedom of these opportunities. Without paying much heed to the air of grave surprise Avith which Ismar regarded his proceedings \u2014 for Ismar himself Avas treated on a different footing \u2014 he drank tea frequently Avithin the precincts of the tent on the quarter-deck, and made the best possible use of his knoAvledge of Arabic, and listened with absorb ing interest to all that Avas said around him."], [89, "VII MARIAM 81 Without doubt his powers of adaptation were taxed to the utmost in this intercourse. When a man has been brought up all his life in the midst of one set of customs and one set of ideas, he is almost certain to come to regard that as the only one in harmony Avith the general constitution of Nature, and all others as merely deviations from it, erroneous by reason of ignorance, carelessness, or Avilful relapse into barbarism. Lanxon indeed was considerably ahead of his felloAV-countrymen on board the ship in this : that he did not assume these new acquaint ances of his to be no better than barbarians. But he did not \u2014 at first, at any rate \u2014 recognize that their customs formed a separate civilization, differing in quality from his OAvn, but guarded by even more stringent regulations : every custom folloAved, not by reason of ignorance or carelessness, but as the result of a deep philosophic inquiry into the consti tution of human nature, and the essentials of it that were to be considered to alloAV for the due formation and stability of social intercourse, Avithout hindering that sense of freedom and equality Avhich is abso lutely necessary to an Arabian, and for Avhich he sacrifices all those various refinements Avhich are of paramount importance in the eyes of a Western. Lanxon approached them unconsciously Avith the same sense of condescension and pity that a good natured member of the higher classes of Western society is wont to feel Avhen in the company of members of the loAver, Avho are devoid of that refine ment of feeling and delicacy of expression and action Avhich in his civilization distinguish the de veloped from the degraded unit of humanity. But G"], [90, "CHAP. 82 MARIAM the astonishment that every indication of such feel ing provoked in some of them, and the lively ridicule from others, especially from Mariam, made him reflect and presently wonder Avhether he Avere not altogether on a wrong tack. Indeed the latter soon brought him to perceive that not only Avere they as proud of their own customs and civilization as he Avas of his, but that they Avere just as much inclined to regard him with pity as a member of a race Avith out manners, Avithout any real perception of the essence of good behaviour, and especially cursed by Allah. Mariam and Wasseefy happened on the third day of the voyage to pass through the saloon shortly after dinner-time, when Lanxon, Avho had been detained by some duties on deck, Avas seated alone, completing his meal. This Avas probably the very first time that Mariam had seen a European sitting at dinner. She had seen Lanxon before this drink a glass of tea, and even eat a cake, but never ply a fork. She AA-as so struck by the spectacle that Avhen she caught sight of him she simply stood rooted to the spot, Avith her eyes fixed in amazement on the uncanny little instrument that he managed to stick into his mouth so rapidly and so deftly Avithout injuring it. From this state she was only aroused by the entrance of the steAvard, Avhen she slipped into a cabin after Wasseefy with the exclamation : \" By Allah, it is Avonderful ! \" Later on, Avhen Lanxon Avas again alone, mixing medicine, Mariam and Wasseefy came out to him, and Avith much appearance of humour asked him to explain why he found it necessary to make use of"], [91, "VII MARIAM 83 the instrument Avhich had struck their attention in his hands. There are some matters Avhich appear so self-evi dent that they need no explanation \u2014 indeed no explanation is often possible ; and when anyone has the audacity to open a question on them, one feels a shock, which is only relieved by supposing either that the questioner is not serious, or that he is a lunatic. Noav, the use of the fork stood, or at any rate had stood until this moment, in the position of ultimate security, to Lanxon's mind. He had never questioned it ; had never heard it questioned ; had never conceived it possible that it could be ques tioned in good faith. Yet here Avas a young lady, Avhom he already kneAV sufficiently Avell to knoAv that she Avas not a fool, actually laughing at him for using a fork. He had often, previous to this, seen Arabs at their meals, but had taken it for granted that they did not use forks simply because they Avere not blessed Avith any, and if they only had the chance would certainly adopt their use. But Mariam was actually vieAving it in the same light, for example, as he Avould vieAv the custom of rubbing noses together as a salutation that obtains amongst some people : namely, as something monstrously funny and gro tesque. As this fact daAvned upon him, he Avas Avell nigh stupefied. It Avas a severe shock to his system, and he stared at them in speechless amazement ; Avhilst they, taking the obvious paralysis that had overAvhelmed his faculties as a tacit assent to the light of ridicule in Avhich they regarded him, plied him mercilessly Avith chaff. \" But,\" he exclaimed finally, Avith considerable"], [92, "84 MARIAM CHAT. indignation, \" I should never think of eating with my fingers. If I saw a lady in my country eating with her fingers, I\u2014 I should not speak to her \u2014 I should not consider her a lady ! \" \" But Avhy ? \" exclaimed both in a breath. \"Because \u2014 because it is dirty!\" Finding his knowledge of Arabic altogether too limited to con vey a due impression of his feelings, Lanxon supple mented it by a gesture of intense disgust. This did not appear to have the intended effect on his auditors. It only caused them to gaze at him Avith greater curiosity, until Lanxon began to realize the sensations of a being Avho is on exhibition as an instance of some aAvful freak of Nature. Mariam ap peared too much lost in Avonder to utter a Avord ; but Wasseefy presently exclaimed, in the tone of one who has found the key to some mystery of philosophy : \" Perhaps they never wash! \" This startling suggestion completed Lanxon's dis comfiture. He Avished to break out into furious Avords of eloquence, sufficient to convince them of their OAvn inferiority. But Avords failed him. He gave vent to a grunt of impatience, and heartily Avished his visitors Avould leave him, since they Avere so blind to the proper constitution of things. But Mariam, Avho Avas evidently trying her best to unravel the puzzle, and seeing he did not make any comment on Wasseefy's solution, said : \"Is it, then, that in your country you have no Avater to Avash with ? \" \" Of course Ave have plenty of Avater ; and Ave AA'ash as often as is necessary,\" he returned, in no gentle tone."], [93, "VII MARIAM 85 Mariam Avas therefore again as much at sea as ever. Wasseefy pulled her away to return to their friends. Mariam Avas about to follow her, still lost in amazement, Avhen a sudden thought seemed to strike her, and she questioned Lanxon once more : \" In your country, Avhen you go out in the streets, do you also Avalk on stilts ? \" But Lanxon did not appear to be conscious of her question. He did not, indeed, fully recover from the effects of his interview for many hours. Things somehoAV seemed topsy-turvy. He avoided Ismar, and stuck to the side of the captain and the other officers, until his interchange of ideas with them once more restored the balance of his mind and re vived the sublime spirit of self-confidence Avhich Avas natural to him. That evening, hoAvever, Avhen Lanxon, after a desultory conversation with Ismar, had betaken himself to the stern-railings, \u2014 there, Avith his nether limits dangling over the water, and his right arm embracing the flagstaff, to court solitude and pon der over many and various things, \u2014 he Avas accosted by Wasseefy, Avho Avas about to enter the tent. \"Noav, most learned Hakim,\" she said, \"Avhy do you not come in to us, and drink some tea, and smoke a narghileh, and listen to a tale ? By Allah, there Avere more wisdom in that than in tumbling into the sea, Avhich you seem likely to do presently ! \" Wasseefy Avas, as has been stated, Mariam's slave ; but no one who had learned the meaning of that term in Western countries Avould have deemed her such from her demeanour. For in every particular she seemed to stand on a perfect equality Avith her"], [94, "86 MARIAM ciiAr. mistress. They addressed each other as tAvo sisters rather than as mistress and servant, let alone mistress and slave. If Wasseefy felt an inclination to speak, she never held the presence of her mistress a reason to hold her tongue, or even to curtail the expression of her thoughts. Wasseefy even sat doAvn to meals Avith Mariam. Nor Avas the amount of daily work she had to perform one tithe of that which falls to the housemaid in an English household. From an early age she had been Mariam's constant com panion and attendant ; she never left her, even now, for a moment, if Mariam issued from the tent. And though she Avas entitled to claim her freedom, \u2014 for both by laAV and custom in Arabia a slave be comes free after a certain number of years, \u2014 she felt no inclination to do so. The personality of Wasseefy perplexed Lanxon, and the constant and equal share she persisted in taking in any conversation betAvixt him and Mariam someAvhat disconcerted him. For to him a slave or a servant could not but remain a slave or a servant ; nor, indeed, Avould he have thought of treating even the sailors or the firemen of the ship, though they Avere at least free men, Avith the perfect and familiar camaraderie Avith which Mariam and the other ladies behaved toAvards Wasseefy, Ibrahim, and the other slaves. Yet Wasseefy Avas possessed of so cheerful a disposition, and her manner Avas so devoid of any conscious pretence, that it reconciled him in some measure to an anomaly which particularly jarred on his social prejudices. \" Listen to a tale ? \" he repeated. \" Even so, by Allah ! \" returned Wasseefy. \" There"], [95, "VII MARIAM 87 is Im-Morayah, avIio is about to regale our ears. Come, I tell you, and be not foolish.\" Thus urged, and not a little stirred Avith curiosity, Lanxon complied. Im-Morayah Avas a Avoman whose especial function in the hareem lay in the telling of stories and the recitation of poetry for the delectation of her mis tresses and the other inmates. They all sat now in some form of a circle, some in cross-legged fashion, others half reclining on carpets or cushions, sipping their tea or lazily draAving up the aromatic fumes that lifted themselves up from the bubbling rose- Avater in each narghileh. They Avaited in silence for some time, Avhilst Im-Morayah seemed lost in thought. One single richly-coloured lantern lit up the place. \"Sister,\" said Im-Abdallah, presently, \"be merci ful, and let us have the secrets of your thoughts.\" \" I was just thinking,\" said Im-Morayah, \" of the story of an ancestress of the lady Mariam's, Avho, wdien young like her, caused a feud to heal up Avhich had continued for many long years betAvixt her tribe and ours. Would you like me to relate it to you ?\" \"By Allah,\" returned Im-Abdallah, \"Ave shall esteem it the greatest boon if you will so favour us.\" \" Very Avell. Then hearken to my Avords, and let not other things distract your attention. It was many years ago, during the time of a great Avar Avith the Turks, in Avhich her tribe, the Beni-Hassan, were engaged. One day, A\\7hen most of the Avarriors of the Beni-Hassan Avere absent, there appeared in their vicinity a strong band of our tribe, the Beni-Kasym ;"], [96, "88 MARIAM CHAP. so that great fear spread amongst the tents of the Beni-Hassan, and they despatched a messenger in great haste to recall their absent sheikh, and made such preparations as they could to resist the ap proaching attack. They had little hope, hoAvever, for they Avere far outnumbered. Noav this girl, Avhose name Avas Helwa, Avas the daughter of the sheikh of the Beni-Hassan ; and Avhen she heard the neAvs her mind Avas greatly disturbed, and she in quired Avho commanded the band of the enemy. And it AA-as said to her that Sheikh Ismeyr com manded them. Then her countenance regained its accustomed appearance of contentment : nay, it rather shone with joy ; so that her mother and her friends Avondcred greatly, and questioned her con cerning her thoughts. And she ansAvered and said unto them : ' Is it not Sheikh Ismeyr Avho commands the Beni-Kasym? And is not Sheikh Ismeyr cele brated as a man of virtue ? ' ' But,' they said, ' there is blood betAvixt us and the Beni-Kasym : so Ave can hope for no mercy at the hands of Sheikh Ismeyr.' But she laughed at them, and said : ' Nay, ye need not fear. Verily, either all that is said of Sheikh Ismeyr is a lie, or he will not attack old men, and Avomen and children, AA'hen he learns that all our Avarriors have gone from us to fight the Turks.' And she made haste, and cast over her person a veil, and fled out into the open, and came on to the space betAvixt the two lines of horsemen, Avhereon, in Arab fashion, single Avarriors Avere careering about challenging their enemies individually to combat. And she raised her voice and cried out the name of Slieikh Ismeyr. And the Sheikh Ismeyr, Avho Avas at the"], [97, "VII MARIAM 89 moment vehemently inciting some one of the Beni- Hassan to come forth and measure himself against him, Avas struck by her voice, for it was the voice of a noble Avoman ; and he reined up his charger and cried out for silence, so that all desisted from their warlike intentions ; and he said to her : ' Speak, noble maiden ; Avhat Avould you have of me ? ' Then at this supreme moment the spirit of Allah entered into the bosom of the maiden Hehva, so that she was inspired and raised out of herself ; and she lifted up her voice and cried out : ' What is this, O Sheikh Ismeyr ? Are you not, though our enemy, the pride of the Arabs, celebrated in the songs of every tribe in the Northern Deserts, for your virtue, your valour, and the generosity of your character? And will you let it be said that Sheikh Ismeyr of the Beni-Kasym attacks a tribe Avhen all its warriors have gone to fight the Osmanli, avIio are accursed in the eyes of Allah and hateful in the eyes of men ? Nay, Avoe is me, and the whole stock of the Arabs, if Sheikh Ismeyr should be guilty of such an offence ! ' And she paused in great sorrow. And Sheikh Ismeyr ansAvered sullenly, as if rebelling against the in fluence of her spirit : ' But revenge is SAveet, noble maiden, and necessary to the honour of a man.' And she answered him vehemently and said : 'Yea, verily, revenge is SAveet and necessary to the honour of a man. But it is not on Avomen and children and old men on Avhom honourable revenge is taken. Such revenge Avould rejoice your spirit for a moment, and blast it for ever after, till you became the loAvest of the Ioav.' Then did the tones of her voice enter into the very recesses of his soul, so that"], [98, "MARIAM CHAP. 90 her spirit permeated his Avhole being, and he an- SAvered humbly : ' Nay, noble maiden, Allah is my Avitness that I shall do no such thing. Go to your tent in peace, and gather your people in safety around you ; and there shall be none of yours, or anything belonging to you, troubled by me or mine. For the soil from Avhich such a rose can spring must be specially blest to Allah. And I will abide in the neighbourhood till the sheikh and his Avarriors return. Then Ave shall see Avhat Allah will cause to happen.' Then Hehva returned in great joy to her tent : and there, in the midst of her Avomen, she broke out into Avords of song describing, with sur passing enthusiasm, the virtues of the noble Sheikh Ismeyr. And Sheikh Ismeyr and his people secured their horses close by, and Avere furnished with food, and made preparations to abide in that place. And it so happened that Sheikh Ismeyr Avalked through the encampment, and he passed the sheikh's tent, and he heard the song of Hehva, so that he Avas greatly moved, and there arose in his heart a fierce longing for this noble maiden Avho esteemed him so highly and had behaved herself so Avell dur ing the day. Therefore, Avhen the sheikh of the Beni-Hassan returned with his AA'arriors, Sheikh Ismeyr rode forth to meet him, and threw himself off his horse Avhen still at a distance, and ran forward, and bent himself over the old man's hand, and kissed it, and raised it to his head. And he said to him : ' Let it not be betAvixt you and me as it has been before. Behold, I came to conquer by force : and I have been conquered by gentleness.

And the old sheikh Avondered greatly, for it was the boast of the Beni-Kasym that they never abated one jot in the revenge for the blood of one of their number, either for money or for any other consideration ; and such a thing as Sheikh Ismeyr proposed had never been heard of. So he Avas greatly pleased, for a blood-feud is a terrible thing, and he hastened to his tent, thinking over Avords of persuasion AvhereAvith he might gain over his daugh ter's consent to the match.

Mariam spoke little ; but even in the dim light shed by the lantern Lanxon could see her face gloAv with a variety of emotions, amongst which pride of race did not seem to be least. Presently the debate languished, and some one suggested that Abu-Brahim should once more be called upon to minister to their pleasure. \" Nay, nay,\" said Ayesha. \" Let us leave the Avorthy man in peace! Is there not our cousin Ismar, Avhose voice is even SAveeter than that of Abu-Brahim, and Avhose learning and education are vastly superior? \" And she fortlnvith raised her voice and called to Ismar.

I am here, and aAvait your Avords.\" \"We desire to tax your poAvers in song for our amusement,\" continued Ayesha. \"May Allah be gracious to you ! \" Ismar raised some demur at first, but Avas pre sently induced to send a servant for his mandoline, whilst he sat himself doAvn in the ante-chamber.

And particularly is it effective in the silence and mystery of night-time, Avhen the con sciousness of man has leisure to listen to the romance of his soul. Ismar's voice Avas cultivated, sonorous and flexible, and of a quality so clear and soft, that though his Avords Avere perfectly in telligible to those for Avhom they Avere intended, the sound of them died away amidst the swish of the Avater, the roll of the screAV, and the throb of the pistons, before it passed the limits of the quarter deck. Without hesitation he plunged into his theme, which revealed itself, to the astonishment of his hearers, as no other than the present voyage. None but an artist Avith perfect confidence in him self Avould have attempted such a subject. The richness of symbolic imagery with Avhich he con trived to clothe the apparently uninteresting descrip tion of the ship \u2014 even unto the heaving pistons \u2014 and of the incidents that had as yet occurred, made Lanxon marvel, and finally lose himself in a maze of wonderment. But he Avas startled out of his reverie by the concluding verses of the song, given Avith a subtle change in the voice that marked them from all that had preceded them. They ran some what as folloAvs : ' But what is most to be admired is the crowned maiden in the vessel ; whose beauty no tongue can describe. . . .

He glanced instinctively at Mariam. She Avas gazing far away, perhaps in reverie, perhaps in the utter absence of thought Avhich supervenes Avhen one gazes into infinity. On her face, at any rate by means of the pale moon light, he could read no change of expression, no uneasiness, no acknowledgment of the exquisite compliment. Perhaps she had not even noticed the subtle variation in the character of the voice. Perhaps she had. Already Lanxon had become conscious of the immense gulf of thought and senti ment that existed betAvixt him and these iicav ac quaintances of his, preventing him from applying to their Avords, actions, and even facial expressions the same canons of interpretation that he had learned to use at home. Yet corroboration of this thought seemed scarcely needed, in face of the conjunction of circumstances that favoured it.

With all the boldness and freedom of character which the life of the Desert instils into Bedouins, Mariam was, besides, endowed Avith the graces that are rather to be acquired in the atmosphere of toAvns. This she OAved to her mother, Avho Avas a native of Bagdad, the daughter of ancestors of great repute, Avho had for many centuries resided in that city, and amassed considerable Avealth in mercantile pursuits. This had descended to Im-Abdallah, and as by the Mohamedan law in all countries which have derived their civilization from Arabia the management and control of a woman's property is secured to her without reference to her husband, she had the means Avherewith to bestOAv on the culture of her daughter every attention that Avealth could provide and motherly solicitude suggest. She herself possessed a fairly cultured mind, \u2014 indeed, she prided herself on her knoAvledge of things religious and philosophic ; and nothing delighted her so much throughout the voyage as a disputation on such matters Avith some neAV antagonist Avorthy of her tongue, whom the complaisant Ismar sought out and brought to her from amongst the pilgrims, he squatting outside and she within the tent, \u2014 -and she devoted herself Avithout stint to the superintendence of her daughter. Mariam, therefore, had learned all that could be learned in toAvns : she was Avell ac quainted Avith Bagdad and Bussorah, and had even visited Damascus, and had spent afternoons in pic nic fashion in its gardens, or on the ' Hadasherieh ' or ' Suphanieh,' listening to the murmur of the run- H"], [106, "98 MARIAM chap. ning waters, the Avords of song, or the music from mandolines and guitars, like any other inhabitant of that pleasure-loving city. Of a third of her mother's Avealth she Avas the heiress, but this inherit ance had been considerably augmented by the bounty of her father; so that, despite the simplicity of her apparel and the affability of her demeanour toAvards inferiors, she Avas, and felt herself to be, a person of great importance. On the folloAving day they Avere in the saloon, Lanxon sitting at the head of the table Avith a pair of scales in front of him, one pan filled with a Avhite pyramid of quinine, of Avhich the uncorked bottle stood by ; and the tAvo girls standing and leaning over the rail of the bench running by the side of the table. The conversation had turned on Mariam's father, the old Emir, and she had been describing his virtues, his valour, and his Avarlike demeanour. The spirit of the narrative had entered into her soul. She spoke in tones, Ioav, but SAvelling with contained energy : her frame quivered Avith the gentle violence of her feelings. Lanxon had often Avondered at the stories he had heard of the extraordinary influence at times exerted by Avomen in Bedouin tribes : hoAv the inspiration that floAved from them Avould brace their Avarriors into heroes ; Iioav, in spite of their Aveakness, they sometimes led them into battle Avith success, Avhen success might have been deemed impossible.

Suddenly the steAvard issued brusquely from the opposite cabin. With a sharp cry and movement the girl recovered herself, and instantly drawing the shroud around her, turned aAvay. When the in nocent cause of her discomfiture had made his exit she gave vent to an expression of an urgent nature, calling doAvn the vengeance of Heaven on the mis creant's eyes. Lanxon had heard Mariam make use of strong language before, but never Avith such evident gratification. He could not refrain from laughing ; at which Mariam expressed astonish ment. \" What, in the name of Allah, are you laughing at?\" \" At your Avords. The poor fellow never did any thing to deserve them.\" \"Verily, he is a Avretch ! \" exclaimed Mariam, in dignantly. \" But Avhy \u2014 -why should you think it so necessary to cover up your face from everybody?\" \" All well-behaved women cover their faces,\" said Mariam, demurely. \"But why?\" cried Lanxon Avith a passionate gesture of interrogation Avhich very nearly capsized the scales. Mariam gazed at him in grave astonishment. \"A maiden veiled,\" she said, \"is like a rosebud Avithin its calyx.\" Lanxon paused in the act of gathering the scat tered quinine and stared at her. \"That is a poetic sentiment,\" he said, \"a beau tiful poetic sentiment.

My name is Khadijeh.\" Lanxon looked at her for some moments in doubt. Her face was quite serious ; but there Avas a slight quiver about Wasseefy's lips and a tAvinkle in her eye that made him shake his head and say : \" No, no ; that Avon't do. I knoAv your name is Mariam.\" \" But you have no right to know,\" she cried, in dignantly in manner, but Avith some indication of"], [109, "MARIAM VIII 101 amusement in her voice. \" You are a stranger.

I suppose it does not matter.\" Yet she seemed quite disgusted Avith herself, and turned aAvay Avith some appearance of resentment. But at the door she paused and looked at him for a moment. \" Come and have some coffee,\" she said suddenly. Lanxon, \u2014 who, Avith hands clasped behind his head, Avas gazing at the receding figure, the perfect moulding of which could not fail to mingle, Avith the tumult of perplexity that distracted his mind, certain clear-sounding notes of admiration, \u2014 Avith grave astonishment, hastened to accept this invita tion with the customary expression of courtesy, and proceeded to finish the business he had in hand Avith the utmost speed that Avas possible. The drinking of coffee in Arabia is a common thing, but never performed in that haphazard man ner which is the usual fate of things that are com mon. Simple as are their tastes, the Arabians are, in a sense, epicures. When they have a good thing they treat it Avith the reverence with Avhich all good things should be treated. Arabian coffee is a good thing : in the eyes of an Arabian it excels most good things. Its preparation and consumption are sur rounded Avith a halo of sentiment having in it a tinge of solemnity. No genuine Arabian Avill drink coffee unless he"], [110, "MARIAM CHAP. 102 sees the berries freshly roasted before him just to that point when a dark crimson- gloAV overspreads them and their outer shells commence to crackle, then transferred to a mortar and pounded gently and lovingly into a coarse, gritty mass \u2014 not into a fine, floAvery poAvder from which all the subtle prop erties Avhich render it so dear to his eyes have been driven aAvay. The liquid extract of this forms a thick black fluid, shining Avith a dull sparkle as the light falls on it. Unless these conditions can be strictly and effec tually carried out, an Arabian will have none of it : he had rather remain Avithout it than commit the sacrilege of drinking coffee under circumstances that prevent its qualities from fully expressing them selves. SomeAvhat akin to this is the restraint which a lover exerts on himself lest, for the momentary gratification of his appetite, his mistress should stand revealed to him shorn of those natural perquisites of her person Avhich secure his respect and give to her charms their full value in his eyes. On board the Lornadale the due performance of all these necessary details was beset Avith difficul ties ; so that tea-drinking became, even amongst the Arabs, the common thing, and coffee Avas reserved as a luxury to be tasted only on particular occasions. Hence Avhen Mariam invited Lanxon to come and drink coffee, he understood that he Avas about to partake of a luxury ; that he might expect to enjoy himself above the ordinary ; that he Avas going to have a treat. More than ever he understood this Avhen he sat himself doAvn a feAv minutes later op posite Mariam, at the far end of the ante-chamber."], [111, "MARIAM 103 VIII The tent by this time had been extended consid erably beyond its original boundaries. It occupied noAv very nearly half the quarter-deck. The curtain betwixt the tent proper and the ante-chamber was pinned back so as to leave a triangular communica tion, through Avhich they could see the rest of the hareem entertaining various visitors, but they could neither hear the visitors' Avords, nor could their own Avords be intelligible to any one else. They Avere practically alone. Mariam reclined on a carpet against the ship's railing. Wasseefy lay in the atti tude which she invariably adopted Avhenever she had the ghost of a chance \u2014 at full length on the deck, leaning on one elbow. Arabian coffee must not be drunk in quantity at a time. It is served out in stinted measure of about two teaspoonfuls, in a tiny little china cup Avithout a handle, called ' finjan ; ' and this finjan is embraced by a structure in the form of an egg-cup of filigree silver or other material. It has to be sipped : no one but an utter barbarian or an irreclaimable rascal Avould do other than sip the precious decoction. The drop, as it alights on the tongue, evokes at first a sensation of bitterness ; then its inner qualities as sert themselves, and, distilling over into surrounding parts, envelop them in fragrant aroma and create in them an all-pervading healthiness Avhich produces happy thoughts and pleasant looks. Such was the effect they apparently produced on Mariam. For the second time she approached her lips to the tiny cup, and touched lightly and tenderly the black fluid that trembled on the brim. Lanxon paused and noted the luscious sweetness of those"], [112, "MARIAM 104 CHAr. lips. He had seen them before, but he had never before seen them look so SAveet and tempting. Over come by this reflection, his philosophic consciousness vanished. Lanxon lapsed into the condition of an ordinary, feeling, sensitive mortal ; he sipped his coffee and found it strangely agreeable to his taste. Had Lanxon retained his powers of reflection he might have seen that he Avas in danger \u2014 that Mariam Avas in a dangerous mood. In that case he Avould doubtless have hastily disposed of his coffee, and Avith equal haste have further made his exit from the tent. For Lanxon Avas honest, and had no in tention of falling in love Avith his companion. But the very absurdity of that notion, as it appeared to his mind, disarmed him. Hoav could he possibly fall in love with a person betAvixt Avhom and him self there yaAvned so great a gulf of thought and sentiment as that they should differ even on so simple and essential a matter as the philosophy of the fork ? Noav, look you, to some the fork may appear a matter of little moment ; but it is not so. It is a more important appanage of West ern civilization than most people are conscious of. People talk Avithout stint of steam and electricity, and the benefits that have accrued to us from them. But the fork, though so humble and obscure, has in its modest Avay intensified the joys of some of the happiest moments of our lives ; and it possesses a greater claim to antiquity than most of the institu tions peculiar to Western civilization. If Ave look around us Ave shall see feAv things that specially belong to us older than the fork. It is older than the morning tub, Avhich only dates from not quite"], [113, "VIII MARIAM 105 the beginning of this century. It is older than the English Bible \u2014 than the Common Prayer Book. Queen Elizabeth certainly possessed tAvo forks : some authorities are inclined to think she had three. It Avas associated in Lanxon's mind with the earliest light of consciousness : Avhen he first kneAV himself he had a distinct recollection of the fork as a highly prized companion, in the moments of parting from which he had his first initiation into the mystery of sorroAv that pervades human life \u2014 that earlier period during Avhich he had been, presumably, restricted to the use of a spoon being entirely obliterated from his memory. So that a doubt on the philosophy of the fork implied more than a mere heresy : it im plied an absolute difference of constitution Avhich nothing in the Avorld could bridge over, far less love \u2014 which, to his mind, was not capable of bridg ing over anything, but must itself result from a perfect compatibility of temper and disposition. Nevertheless there aAvoke with overwhelming force Avithin him at this moment a consciousness of the utter loveliness of the girl before him. The soft ness and richness of her Avomanhood came over his senses. It seemed as if, perchance moved by some thing in their late conversation, she purposely al loAved the influences Avhich had hitherto been held in check to radiate in unrestrained freedom from her person. A provoking spirit of friendly cama raderie mingled itself Avith the light fragrance of roses that hung around her. She had discarded her shroud entirely. The SAvelling outline of her figure lay revealed in all its incomparable symmetry. A light veil alone covered her hair, amidst the tresses"], [114, "106 MARIAM CHAP. of which there glittered a feAv small gold and silver coins. There Avas a breeze \u2014 a Avarm and sultry breeze, sufficient to softly agitate the veil \u2014 sufficient to bloAv certain locks into urgent endeavour, as if piteously entreating to kiss her cheeks. The coffee Avas certainly delicious. It suggested itself to Lanxon's mind that there were feAv things more delicious than the drinking of Arabian coffee. He was past the stage where it is possible to ask the Avhy and the Avherefore of a phenomenon. The philosopher accepted the suggestion Avithout inquir ing into its philosophy. When you come to think of it, there Avas matter indeed to ovenvhelm him. To the Avorld in general this young lady was a closed book, bound tightly with the finest and most unyielding of clasps ; offer ing not even so much as a title to the gaze of the curious; a Avorld of hidden possibilities, mysterious, inaccessible. To his eyes alone she revealed herself in all her loveliness. Yet at this very moment he would indignantly have scouted the insinuation that he was moved toAvards her by any but the most platonic of feel ings ; he Avould have laughed at the suggestion that she viewed him Avith any special interest. Neither of these hypotheses even occurred to his mind. There Avas no room for them. It Avas possessed Avholly by one idea ; everything else but this idea had receded for him into the regions of the Infinite : there Avas certainly, in the Avhole universe, nothing more delicious than the drinking of Arabian coffee. It galls one to speak under such circumstances ; and yet the prolonged silence, overcharged as it was"], [115, "MARIAM VIII 107 Avith vague and unutterable sensations, makes one nervous. However, as he Avas still preparing himself for a conversation which Avould doubtless have proved very interesting, there came to their ears the sounds of a hubbub amidst the pilgrims about the main-hatch Avhich promptly caused all other feelings to give place to an eager curiosity. To afford a sufficient explanation of this hubbub to the reader, we must leave for a while the quarter-deck, and consider certain events which were taking place in another part of the ship. The Avild-looking contingent from Central Asia had at first kept themselves someA.hat apart from the others ; evidently shy, and strange to the usages of those around them. But soon they gathered courage, and this self-same afternoon tAvo of their Avomen paid a visit to the neat little tent of our friend the Bagdadi, Avhilst he himself Avas far aAvay, leaning over the boAVS and Avatching the ship cleav ing its Avay through the blue water and the innumer able jelly-fish. Presently they made themselves obtrusively at home, and went so far as to request the loan of certain utensils, such as a tea-pot, pans, etc., for their OAvn use. Im-Brahim had received them very courteously ; but imagine her horror at the idea of alloAving her property, in the preservation of which she so delighted, to pass into the hands of these strangers, who did not strike her as being either very ladylike in their manners, or very cleanly in their appearance ! Of course she refused, where upon they began to be abusive in their language. Then the mother-in-law arose and pitched them out. She Avas furious, for one of the women, Avho had a"], [116, "108 MARIAM CHAP. green veil over her head, had addressed herself to her in particularly offensive language. The Turkish Avoman Avhom Ave have before noticed as having ob tained the sobriquet of ' the Avoman in black ' hap pened to be passing by; and she bundled off the intruders with a resistless SAveep of her mighty arms, and a loudly uttered injunction to go and pray to the Prophet and generally mind their OAvn business. But the mother-in -laAV Avas not satisfied. She fetched out a bludgeon, evidently manufactured in the first instance for the purpose of manslaughter, Avith a knob on it as big as a good-sized Avatermelon. With this, as far as could be gathered from her in coherent language, she intended to damage that green veil somewhat. To appease her Avas im possible. Seeing that entreaties Avere useless, her daughter resorted to actual restraint, and held her back as forcibly as she could. But she had well-nigh torn herself aAvay, Avhen the Avoman in black entered the tent and enveloped her in an embrace that, for the moment, extinguished her hopes. Yet she struggled vehemently; so, as a last resource, they muffled her up in mattresses and carpets, and laid a couple of heavy packages over all to keep her doAvn. In that position she broke out into passionate Avords of song, Avherein she described hoAv her ances tors had originally come from the Desert of Arabia, hoAv they had never brooked an insult, Iioav she had been insulted, and hoAv she was going at some future time, if not in the present (considering the circum stance that withheld her), to be revenged. By this time the Bagdadi had arrived on the scene of the battle, and Avhen he surveyed the desolation of his"], [117, "MARIAM VIII 109 lately serene and happy home he was mightily moved. He conferred with his fellows \u2014 who had sat calmly around in their customary attitudes, not venturing to interfere in a Avoman's quarrel \u2014 but, after discussing matters Avith them, came to the same conclusion, that there Avas nothing to be done, as they could not fight AvithAvomen. Meanwhile the other Avomen had returned to their people, and, by their lamentations and their fanciful description of the treatment they had just received \u2014 asserting in the most forcible language that they had been handled by men \u2014 greatly excited their Avrath. One young felloAv in particular seemed deeply moved. He spoke not a word, but glared to such good pur pose that on the spot he became affected Avith a squint, and, seizing a big stick, advanced firmly aft. Hardly had he passed the engine-room, when he was disarmed and cast down by the Bagdadi ; and had he not been rescued by a couple of sailors and the chief mate, his life Avould have been cut short in its early prime. From the tent on the quarter-deck Im-Abdallah heard the sound of the ' schamata,' or roAV. Curious to learn the cause, she sent forth in search of in formation, and, on becoming acquainted Avith the facts of the case, expressed great concern that such a thing should have happened, especially amongst her own sex ; considering that they were all bound together in the ties of the same religion, and under taking this journey Avith the same sacred object in view.

Thus she Avon their confidence ; and each, of her own accord and anxious to appear less umvorthy in her sight, blurted out her oavii version of the matter with far less acrimony than had previously been in their thoughts. The Avoman in black Avas also there, smiling and unruffled, and Avhenever she could catch the old lady's eye, beaming on her in an ecstasy of respectful admiration. Im-Brahim, Avho had ac companied her mother, Avaited outside in the ante chamber, and joined Mariam and Lanxon ; Avho forthwith began to discourse to them on the nature of sharks, porpoises, and the smaller fish they could see frisking in the Avaters beneath them. Im-Abdallah laughed at the confusion and the contradictory statements of the tAvo culprits. \" Nay, my sisters,\" she cried, \" sit you doAvn and be Avelcome. Here, Ibrahim, bring these ladies refreshments and tea and narghilehs, so that Ave may have a comfortable talk together. The affair appears to me to be more Avorthy of laughter than of serious attention. But take time to rest, and calm your selves ; then you will be inclined to regard it Avith the equanimity of mind that, in such matters, should ever distinguish those who arc versed in the pre cepts of the Koran and filled Avith the spirit of its teachings.\" So they sat doAvn and refreshed themselves, and drank tea, and dreAv in the soothing fumes through"], [119, "viii MARIAM 111 the bubbling rose-Avater. And as they did so, eying each other in doubt and occasional disdain, they struck the members of the hareem, Avho were curiously observing them, in an intensely humorous light ; insomuch that presently everybody but them selves Avas smiling perceptibly. The old lady her self pulled away at her narghileh in a state of great complacency, silently Avatching the play of their countenances. Nor could the evident amusement of the on -lookers fail to react on the belligerents, so that their black thoughts lost half their substance, and they began to see clearly through them, and even to Avonder secretly Avhat extraordinary conca tenation of circumstances could have induced them to figure in so ludicrous a light. As the pregnant silence continued, disturbed only by the soft murmur of the narghilehs, this feeling increased, almost to the exclusion of that of resentment. The Avise Im- Abdallah, Avho had not lived the fifty-five years of her life \u2014 -a great part in the constant practice of her present magisterial functions \u2014 in vain, seeing that their anger had evaporated, and that nothing re mained but to pave the Avay by her Avords to an active reconciliation, seized the propitious moment and spoke : \"Consider, my sisters, the shame of such a thing!

The bloAvs are comparatively soft, but the Avords are hard, bitter, biting, poisonous.

Then \u2014 since Avomen have no love for fighting after the first momentary passion is over \u2014 they brood over those Avords, and make of them an ever-fresh source of irritation to their minds, so that they can get no rest.

Sheikh Salim Avas delirious. The delirium was Ioav and muttering at present, but threatened rapidly to increase, so as to become troublesome to all in his vicinity.

But, as the same Avriter says again : ' That Avhich ap pears an unmitigated evil to the limited vision of man is often but a measure ordained by the Avisdom of Allah to neutralize some other evil.' Thus if the government of the Turks is evil, no less an evil is the general devotion to accumulation of Avealth, and the fierce spirit of display it engenders: making all other things, even that which is sublime, of no im portance in comparison to Avealth.

But, as if all circumstances conspired to increase the perplexity of his mind, he found himself again compelled to delay his intention ; for though his eyes descried Ismar through the deepening evening gloom, it Avas in such a situation that he could by no means approach him. Ismar, in fact, Avas taking part in one of the many Atonement services for the death of Ali, Hassan, and Hosein that Avere continu ally going on amongst the pilgrims. A feAv Avords of explanation concerning this service will not be amiss. There are amongst the Moslems two great divi sions, the Sunnites and the Sheites. The Turks are all Sunnites ; the Persians and many of the Arabs, Sheites. The pilgrims on board all belonged to the latter division, with the exception of about sixty Bagdadii and Bussoris. They differ in that the Sheites regard Ali, the cousin and son-in-laAv of Mohamed, as a true Caliph and successor of the Prophet ; Avhereas the Sunnites accuse him of the assassination of the preceding Caliph, Othman, and therefore execrate him. Amongst all the figures that circle round Mohamed and brighten Avith their qualities the DaAvn of Islam"], [130, "MARIAM CHAP. 122 there is certainly none grander than that of Ali. He married the Prophet's daughter Fatima, and had by her tAvo sons, Hassan and Hosein. He Avas the darling of the Arabs, for he Avas pre-eminently cn doAved Avith the qualities most prized by them. He Avas brave to such a degree that he Avon from Mohamed the appellation of ' Lion of God.' He Avas eloquent and poetical \u2014 many of his sayings and verses having been handed doAvn and treasured amongst them to this day. He Avas generous to a fault : it Avas his invariable rule to give aAvay every Friday in equal division all that remained over in the treasury. Of his magnanimity, of his noble scorn of everything false and mean, his history abounds with countless instances. But he had the misfortune at one period of incur ring the deadly hatred of Ayesha, the favourite Avise of Mohamed after Khadijah's death. She never forgave him. After Mohamed's death Ayesha obtained great influence ; and during the Avhole of her AvidoAvhood her one object in life appears to have been the overthroAv of Ali and all his family. She plotted and intrigued in prh7ate, took the head of armies in public, even employed the dastard aid of assassins and poisoners Avhen other methods failed. Hence arose the intestine troubles, foul conspiracies, and huge revolts that distracted and sapped the groAving poAver of Islam so soon after Mohamed's death. When Ali's turn came to be made Caliph, she falsely accused him of having murdered his pre decessor, the truth being that she had herself insti gated Othman's murder, and Hassan, the son of Ali, having very nearly lost his life in defending him."], [131, "IX MARIAM 123 Ali conquered his adversaries in the open field, and made Ayesha prisoner. He generously pardoned her, gave her her freedom and every luxury she could ask for ; Avith the sole condition that she should entirely retire from public life, in which she had wrought such mischief. He was reAvarded by assas sination. His son Hassan \u2014 Avhose nobility of char acter was so great that, to avoid civil war and dissensions amongst the faithful, he voluntarily resigned all claims to the Caliphate and retired into private life \u2014 died by poison. His brother Hosein, whose tragic death, with that of his family and seventy-tAVO folloAvers, is commemorated every year by the Sheites Avith tears and lamentations and even self-inflicted wounds, met his fate later. He was called to the Caliphate \u2014 being the only direct de scendant of Mohamed \u2014 a good deal against his own Avish ; and being invited by the inhabitants of the city of Cufa, on the Euphrates, to come and raise the banner of Ali amongst them, started off on his jour ney across the desert with a small band of devoted folloAvers. Arrived near Cufa, he found that city already in the hands of his opponent's lieutenant, and the inhabitants forced or persuaded to turn against him. Here his party Avas surrounded by some thousands of adversaries \u2014 many of whom had fought Avith and under his father in the days of Mohamed, and even Avhilst preparing to attack him expressing aloud their horror at the deed they were compelled, under superior orders, to commit ; some even deserting at the last moment to his side, and preferring a share of his fate to such everlasting dishonour \u2014 and butchered."], [132, "MARIAM CHAP. 124 It is a remarkable instance of Mohamed's great sagacity and the poA\\-erful insight he possessed into the inner thoughts of those with whom he came into contact, that he actually foretold in a general way, long before his own death, the series of events above described. It will be seen by the above that the Sheites or adherents of Ali Avere themselves in great measure responsible for the catastrophe that befell Hosein, by reason of their fickleness at Cufa. Hence the service of Atonement in which Ismar, to Lanxon's great disgust, Avas iioav taking part, utterly oblivious of everything else about him. The group Avas gath ered close to the quarter-deck round a certain man, Avho, seated in their midst on some elevation, began the recital in a monotone of the tragedy.

Presently they began to sob, and finally to cry aloud with anguish, and beat their heads and breasts and tear their hair. The reciter SAvayed his audience with thronging Avords of passion, with soft Avhispers of entreaty, Avith broken ejaculations of agony. Then suddenly his mood changed. What had passed had been a confession of their sin and an acknoAvledg ment of the justice of any punishment that might fall on them.

Then, Avhen all Avas finished, narghilehs were handed round, and the Avhole company enjoyed a quiet smoke to calm their excited feelings. Lanxon seized the first opportunity that offered of separating Ismar from his companions and drawing him apart. Together they paced the quarter-deck. \" There has been forced on my knoAvledge, Ismar,\" said Lanxon, \" something that compels me to seek this conversation, in hopes that Avhat may fall from your lips will come in the way of explanation and afford me sufficient light AvhereAvith to guide my further course ; yet it is of a nature so delicate that, by reason of the attendant circumstances, I almost shrink from uttering the necessary words.\" \" Nay, my friend,\" said Ismar, \" let not your mind start from imaginary dangers.\" \" I shall rejoice,\" returned Lanxon, \" to find that my misgivings, both with regard to your attitudes in face of Avhat I am about to ask you and Avith regard to the general circumstance, are but vain and fanci ful.

But the latter's Avords and man ner had aAvakened a sense of apprehension that im pelled him to be more communicative ; nor could Lanxon's evident sincerity fail to impress him. As often happens, there existed in the innermost char acters of these tAvo men elements that tended to draAV them insensibly together, despite the stubborn outAvard barriers that existed betAveen them, and a possible repulsion, in the first instance, on the side of Ismar, created by circumstances. Thus, though they could hardly be termed friends, each excited in the other an acknoAvledgment of Avorth, which increased as the time passed on. After some moments passed in silence, Ismar invited Lanxon to sit doAvn. \" Your Avords,\" he said, \" impel me to think that mischief is breAving ; nor am I ignorant of the possi bility of mischief.

The blight which has come over the consciousness of the latter is not due to any peculiarity of Islam : it is the common result of every religion which is rigid in structure, minute in detail, definite in pre cept, and based on records of unimpeachable authen ticity and authority. The Koran at one time fed the minds of Mohamedans, Avhen Mohamedans Avere the most eminent of all nations in every art and grace of civilization. But it is a physiological fact that the same food, even though it be of the most delicate, administered time after time Avithout varia tion, ceases at length to afford the system any nourishment. And the same is true of mental pro cesses as of physical. There have been variations and modifications of the doctrines of the Koran ; but all such movements Avere limited by the un changeable and unimpeachable authority of the Koran, and ended finally in a similar sameness of effect. Mohamed is the centre-piece in the Mohamedan religious sentiment ; Mohamed un doubtedly Avrote the Koran : nor, since the Koran lay in the hands of people of a similar nationality and bent of mind as its author, is there much room for fanciful interpretation. It is therefore impos-"], [139, "MARIAM X 131 sible for the Mohamedan to imitate the Christian religious sentiment in its restless change of phase. And from the Avant of change \u2014 so necessary to human life \u2014 there results apathy. A time came Avhen Islam ceased to nourish intellectually. It re mains a religion believed in and clung to with un rivalled force, but producing rather a dull apathy than a healthy agitation in the minds of its votaries. Private excellence is common enough amongst Mo hamedans, scarcely less so than amongst Christians ; but a living public consciousness, that takes public cognizance of evil and publicly denounces it, so as to compel even evil to assume the outAvard garb of goodness, is rare, exceedingly rare. In Arabia, Avhere the virile force of the individual is greater than in any other part of the Mohamedan Avorld, there have been seen occasional outbursts of pent up forces \u2014 notably in the great Wahabee move ment, at the end of the last century. But they were necessarily of short duration, as the outburst led to nothing neAV after its intrinsic excitement had passed. Yet it is as Avell to bear in mind that both the Koran and the belief in the Koran are still there ; that the lofty wave, after it has vanished in the holloAv, may rise again to a similar height beyond ; that it may need but a sufficient genius to appear at the proper moment to make the Mo hamedan world to live once more as it has lived before. The old religion of Arabia was itself a worn-out theme and void of healthy influence on its votaries, when Mohamed arose, and, fashioning it afresh in the guise of Islam, made it a beacon of fire to serve them for many long centuries again."], [140, "MARIAM CHAP. 132 But in Ismar the long-continued exposure to Western thought\u2014 the chief characteristic of Avhich is a rapid flitting from phase to phase \u2014 that had attended the period of life Avhen the mind is most susceptible, though it had proved poAverless to effect his conversion, had yet introduced such novel and varied hues into the colouring of his consciousness that this apathy had totally disappeared ; the grey dulness of the Mohamedan horizon had vanished before the fresh and brilliant tints of the neAV-born and quivering light of modern conception. \" I hardly knoAv him personally,\" continued Ismar. \" Once many years ago, before I left for Europe, Ave met at a friendly gathering of the Beni-Kasym and the Anazeh. . . .

Let it suffice for our purpose that there came a time when Djellal-el-Deen found that his manners had acquired for him so evil an odour in his oavii and neighbouring tribes that he thought it best to abandon the desert and flee for protec tion and sympathy to the Pasha of Bagdad. The Osmanli, true to a policy Avhich seeks to secure their OAvn supremacy by fomenting dissensions amongst ourselves, received Djellal-el-Deen, Avhose noble rank amongst the Anazeh rendered him of great impor tance in their eyes, Avith open arms. After aAvhile they made him sheikh of a certain mongrel rabble,"], [143, "X MARIAM 135 composed of a mixture of degraded Bedouins, out casts like himself from nobler tribes, adventurers, and the refuse of the peasantry, that styled them selves Bedouins and dAvelt in the neighbourhood. \" My late cousin the Sheikh Amin, father of Ma riam, Avas a man of such sentiments and deeds as we delight to commemorate in our songs and hold up for an example to our young men. In him the old Arabian honour lh7ed untarnished ; he Avas brave as a lion, profuse in liberality, simple in tastes, ab stemious in manner of living. Understand this : that though he Avould have raised no objection to his daughter's marrying the poorest Bedouin of his or any other noble tribe, so long as he had shoAvn him self Avorthy of the commendation of his felloAvs, he Avould have preferred her death to her becoming the wife of one who had disgraced himself, though noble and rich, or of an Osmanli, though he Avere a pasha. For he regarded the Osmanli with that intensity of scorn and hatred Avhich is common amongst Ara bians Avho have had experience of them. He could not fail to view the conduct of Djellal-el-Deen Avith extreme displeasure ; nor did he desist from remon strating Avith and exhorting him, until this last act of Djellal-el-Deen's completed the estrangement betAveen them. After that he declared Djellal-el- Deen to be in his eyes no better than a dog; nor, though his brother Nasr was married to Djellal el-Deen's cousin, would he have anything more to do Avith him. \" After Amin's death, Avhen Nasr became Emir, things changed a little ; for though both Nasr and Ayesha regarded Djellal-el-Deen Avith no favour, they"], [144, "136 MARIAM CHAP. Avere yet averse entirely to break family ties, which Avith us are regarded as matters of the utmost veneration and importance. Thus they continued a cold and outAvard semblance of friendship, Avithout, however, admitting him into the intimacy of the family. Judge, therefore, of the surprise occasioned a short Avhile ago by a message from Djellal-el-Deen \u2014 Avho had apparently heard of or perchance, by some means, even seen Mariam \u2014 requesting her in marriage. On referring the petition to Im-Abdallah and her daughter, they both declared that death Avould be preferable to such a misfortune, which Avould not merely be productive of unhappiness to Mariam, but Avould be putting to shame the mem ory of a glorious father, avIio had held this man in abhorrence.\" \" But,\" interrupted Lanxon, \" if I understand you aright, Mariam had no personal acquaintance with Djellal-el-Deen . . . she did not even knoAv him by sight ? \" \" No, no personal acquaintance, certainly . . . without doubt she may have seen him, though at his appearance it AA7as ahvays her custom to with draAv.\" \" Then,\" said Lanxon, meditatively, \" you could not foretell the effect that such an acquaintance, if it Avere possible to occur, Avould have on this de cision of hers . . . she has not in any Avay revealed the state of her personal feelings toAvards Djellal-el- Deen ? \" \" My friend,\" said Ismar, \" you must bear in mind the authority Avith Avhich parental influence is clothed amongst us. Especially in these matters"], [145, "MARIAM X 137 both youths and maidens are in the habit of re posing implicit faith in the judgment of those Avho by their greater experience are better qualified to judge, and by their relation to themselves are most likely to act from feelings of the most disinterested affection. Sometimes, it must be alloAved, this cus tom is set aside, when circumstances have lit up a spontaneous affection betAvixt tAvo persons, either by the independent action of the lovers, or Avith the acquiescence of the parents, provided they see nothing objectionable in the match. In this case, hoAvever, there is no possibility of personal feelings being concerned ; nor do I hesitate to say that, even were there opportunities for such arising, Mariam is of too honourable and noble a nature to do else than spurn the man who incurred to such a degree the contempt and disgust of her father \u2014 a father Avhose memory is revered by every person around her as that of a being supremely Avorthy of confidence. You cannot judge as I, not knoAving her or the sen timents that control her actions Mariam might Avell be capable of taking matters into her OAvn hands, should her feelings so impel her... but never in a direction that Avould cast a reflection on the honour of her family. However, let me com plete my narrative. \" You may Avell conceive that this message from Djellal-el-Deen placed my cousin in a most uncom fortable situation. By the Prophet, it is no matter of idleness or ease to be a sheikh, or even an emir over many sheikhs. Bedouins are not easy people to govern ; and Avhen you have to keep adjusting the differences which may arise betAvixt any two of"], [146, "138 MARIAM CHAP. a few scores of independent sheikhs, each of whom is the nominal ruler again over a few hundreds or thousands of equally independent units... and this rather by moral suasion than by display of force, Avhich Avould act on a Bedouin very much as a red cloth docs on a bull, you have provided for you a sufficiency of employment. A kind of despot, Avith out doubt ; but constrained by cogent circumstances into one of an exceeding benevolence... Avith con siderable inducement to minister to the public Aveal rather than to personal impulse. Here were offered him tAvo alternatives : the one, to perpetrate a dis honourable act by using compulsion in furtherance of Djellal-el-Deen's desire ... a course which, even apart from violence to his OAvn feelings, Avould have as suredly shocked the sensibility of his people, and materially affected their allegiance, by reason of their attachment to the memory of his brother; the other \u2014 to which, in justice it must be said, his own inclination turned \u2014 to defy Djellal-el-Deen by a re fusal. Noav, although every single man of the Beni- Kasym Avould have obeyed Avith alacrity a call to arms, there were many circumstances that compelled their more politic emir to hesitate from driving matters to open Avarfare. In the first place, he kneAV Djellal-el-Deen sufficiently Avell to feel that the latter Avould care little as to the damage his party might sustain so long as he attained his object ; Avhereas to my cousin the possibility of injury to his people Avas a matter of grave import : it Avould therefore be a conflict Avherein, even if equally balanced, one Avould sacrifice all Avith less compunction than the other Avould suffer at losing little. In the second place,"], [147, "X MARIAM 139 Djellal-el-Deen had behind him the Osmanli power, a poAver comparatively Avell disciplined and Avell armed, provided Avith artillery and other muniments of war Avith Avhich we are only beginning to furnish our selves. In the third place, he Avas bound by compact Avith his ally the great Emir of Djebel-Shammar, Avho rules over the major portion of Central Arabia, to avoid squandering his resources and Aveakening his pOAvers in vain and petty conflicts ... in vieAv of certain contingencies which may at any moment arise. And a conflict Avith Djellal-el-Deen appeared to him in this connection more to be avoided than an open rupture Avith the Osmanli, for it involved fight ing Avith Bedouins, many of them belonging to poAverful tribes, Avho, though they Avere practically outcast, could not Avholly have forgotten the sym pathy and duties Avhich the ties of kindred inspire in each one of us, and Avhich might impel them, if not actually to avenge any harm done to these outcasts, yet to view the Beni-Kasym Avith feelings far removed from friendship, and thus produce the dissensions Avhich it was the chief object of both my cousin and the Emir of Djebel-Shammar to avoid, and that of the Osmanli to encourage. \" Noav it happened that at this time the lady Ayesha had not merely made up her mind to per form the pilgrimage to Mecca, but all arrangements had been completed, and we were daily awaiting the news of the readiness of this good ship to take her party on board.

X the lady Ayesha came to their aid and, by means of the suggestions of a mind which had remained com paratively unaffected by the general beAvilderment, promptly relieved the situation. Her idea Avas that both Mariam and Im-Abdallah should accompany her on the pilgrimage, as if this Avere a proceeding which had been planned previous to the receipt of the disturbing message ; that this Avould afford the means for returning an evasive ansAver to Djellal-el- Deen, Avho by the time that Mariam returned \u2014 and since they had friends in the Hedjaz, there Avas no urgent necessity for haste in that matter : or they might even journey back overland and throAv themselves upon the hospitality of their friend the Emir of Djebel-Shammar for a Avhile \u2014 Avould prob ably have forgotten his infatuation.

I Avould I kneAV you sufficiently of such a nature that I could Avith safety disclose to you everything, and leave the matter in your hands.

Avould you circumvent him by taking him at a disadvantage and striking him doAvn first ? \" Ismar pondered aAvhile. And Avhen he spoke, it Avas in an altered tone ; a reluctance seemed to drag his Avords, a coldness seemed to freeze them : which Lanxon remarked, and failed not to interpret by the light of that Avhich seemed to him most likely. \" What must be shall be. Allah alone knoAvs the beginnings and endings of all things. It is enough for a man to do each moment his present duty . . . in face of actual necessity . . . not of vain imagin ings.\" \" A certain learned man of the West, though not of my country,\" said Lanxon, presently, \" once declared that language Avas made use of by men to conceal their thoughts. Your Avords appear to enunciate a certain sort of fatalism, but they are indefinite.\" \" You should not Avonder,\" replied Ismar, \" if I seem to speak at random ; since your own Avords are clothed in a mystery Avhich makes me uncertain as to their meaning. It is not reasonable to expect one to hit a distant mark in a mist.\""], [151, "MARIAM XI 143 With these Avords, and Avith some indication of impatience, Ismar rose and left the spot. A disturbed vagueness characterized Lanxon's solitary cogitations. The various and superimposed currents of thought, the resultants of the energy set in motion by the various influences acting at various moments on the human mind, but \u2014 except in those prone to constant and honest self-examination, a laborious and endless occupation which forms an admirable preparation for future residence in a luna tic asylum \u2014 seldom streaming with unbroken con tinuity and distinctness all at once into the full light of consciousness, now rose and fell and jumbled themselves up in him, so as to produce remarkable results. Parental influence ! He was Avell aAvare of the force that parental influence Avould have Avith Mariam ; and Ismar, as it seemed to him, had spoken with disgusting complacency of the results that Avere to be expected from it ; and, without doubt, the Avhole Aveight of parental influence Avould serve to incline the scale in favour of Ismar. This prospect upheaved a Avild wave of repulsion to Ismar ; and he thought that this upheaval Avas but an expression of sympathy Avith Djellal-el-Deen, Avho did not at all appear so black in his eyes as Ismar had tried to paint him : so that he somewhat gloried in the sen timent ; for it rejoices one to find assurance of an existence in one's composition of an impartiality, a justice, a leaning toAvard the weaker side if but the faintest tinge of right colours its cause. He deemed himself in face of a system \u2014 absurdly overwhelming parental influence ; a system that would obviously secure the prize to Ismar. This system appeared to"], [152, "MARIAM 144 CHAP. him a huge injustice, a relic of barbarism ; and he thought he Avas only actuated to take this vieAV by reason of his desire for justice on behalf of Djellal el-Deen. But all this cogitation Avas of a vagueness, a subterranean grumbling, that he suddenly Avoke up from to find that it had nothing to do with that which lay before him. So he bestirred himself. As he came Avithin the rays of light that streamed through the door from the lamp in the captain's deck-cabin, Captain Polwarth hailed him from Avithin. \" Here, doctor ! Come in and taste the latest production of our Avorthy friend the steAvard. It is a right good drink. That man has a genius for the concoction of palatable drinks.\" \" You are right ; it is good. Seems better than any that he has yet prepared.\" \" He prepares a fresh one every day, and the last ahvays takes the cake.\" \" In these regions of unquenchable thirst even the nectar of the gods Avould soon seem stale and void of flavour to the over-exercised palate.\" \"That man is invaluable.\" \" Under the circumstances, he is a perfect god send.\" \" He has been engaged in the concoction of this beverage Avhich noAv refreshes and delights our senses, the Avhole of the afternoon.\" \" His devotion is phenomenal.\" \" Indeed, he is at the present moment lying in his berth in a sad state of Avhat, Avere Ave not so deeply indebted to him, Ave should call intoxication.\" \" He has sacrificed himself for the good of others.\" \"A most touching example of self-sacrifice.\""], [153, "MARIAM 145 XI \"And worthy to be recorded.\" \" He is a martyr.

They have no experience ; and the result being doubtful, I think I shall leave it unrecorded.\" \" I recognize in this beverage both lime-juice and ginger-beer.

He risks himself in order to save us from all risks.\" \" A noble steward ! \" \" He holds, as a cardinal axiom, that all drinks meant to assuage thirst in the enervating climate to Avhich we are exposed must contain a certain pro portion of stimulants.\" \" The natives of these parts do not indulge in stimulants.\" L"], [154, "146 MARIAM cii.\\r. \" That is because they folloAv the False Prophet and are led astray.

What's up ? \"Much.\" \" You cannot have received any letters at any of the Persian ports Ave have stopped at ? \" No. Then it is something within the ship? \" It is.\" \" Is it public matter ?

There are matters \u2014 pressing matters \u2014 that call me aAvay, I say, captain, suppos ing you had reason to expect an attack from an enemy : Avould you seize an opportunity of striking him doAvn beforehand, Avithout Avaiting for his at tack ? \" \" If I were certain of his meaning me harm, I should have little compunction in putting it out of his poAver to carry out his intention.\""], [155, "MARIAM XI 147 \" Ah ! Well, good-night.\" \" Good-night.\" With the natural inclination of minds that are en doAved Avith ordinary attributes, Lanxon had sought in the advice of others for some lightening of the load that rested on his shoulders, and, as usually happens, had found none. The matter was this \u2014 a complicated matter : Supposing, as he had reason to suppose, that Sheikh Salim and Djellal-el-Deen Avere one and the same person, there appeared every reason to expect shortly a catastrophe which might involve the ship, and Avould certainly affect individ uals for Avhom the ship's authorities were in some measure responsible till they Avere safely landed at their destination. Assuming that Ismar's account of Djellal-el-Deen, if not quite accurate, still bore some resemblance to the truth, it was not to be doubted that he was a man Avhose purpose obstacles Avould have little effect in daunting ; his very pre sence on board, alone and unattended, engaging in so haphazard a manner in an adventure the end of Avhich could not be foreseen, proved that he Avas a creature of impulse on whose actions ordinary con siderations, even of personal safety, Avould have scant restraining influence in his pursuit of that Avhich he desired ; so that, although Lanxon had no conception of the actual line of conduct he intended to adopt, it appeared abundantly clear \u2014 and the tone of his Avanderings suggested the same thought \u2014 that he had in view some definite object, and that he Avould seize the first opportunity that offered for attaining the same. Now this object could be none other than the possession of Mariam, which, under"], [156, "148 MARIAM CHAP. the circumstances, Avould have to be effected by violence \u2014 violence Avhich, if it occurred on board, Avould certainly endanger the ship and recoil on its authorities, since they could not possibly adopt a neutral attitude in face of such a proceeding. A collection of pilgrims affords a mass of inflam mable matter ; there Avere endless causes of fric tion betAvixt these pilgrims and the crew ; Lanxon kneAV of many instances in other ships Avhere this friction had ended in open ruptures, Avith consequent, and sometimes considerable, bloodshed ; and from such conditions Djellal-el-Deen might Avell hope to. profit. Lanxon honestly tried to regard the matter merely from the point of vieAV of the safety of the ship and its responsibilities. He steeled himself against any personal interest in Mariam. He said to himself \u2014 and he repeated the asseveration oftener, perhaps, than he Avas conscious of doing \u2014 that the ultimate outcome of the affair was no busi ness of his ; that he was not qualified by sufficient acquaintance Avith the manners of the people con cerned, or with themselves, to judge the position morally so as to throAV his influence on the side of the right ; that his duty was simply to secure the safety of the ship, and therefore, if possible, to pre vent anything that might happen from happening on board of the Lornadale. There was an easy Avay of doing this. Djellal-el- Deen lay in the clutches of the ague. He Avas resting now in sleep ; but to-morroAv at nine o'clock \u2014 the same hour at which it had fallen on him that morning \u2014 it Avould assuredly, if he were left to him self, seize him again, and again the day after ; and"], [157, "MARIAM \u2022XI 149 so on, until it had burnt all robustness out of him, Avhen, having nothing more to feed on, it would leave him \u2014 for Persian Gulf fever is seldom, if ever, fatal \u2014 Avith hardly the strength to stand, much less to enter arduously into a conspiracy that was to terminate in an enterprise of violence. The fever Avould not leave him for at least some five or six days ; and since the Lornadale Avould in all probability reach Djeddah in a fortnight, there was very little likelihood of his regaining strength suffi ciently before that time to become dangerous. And after the Lornadale had reached Djeddah it was no concern of his, Lanxon again assured himself, what happened ; his responsibility Avould cease. This plan of leaving Djellal-el-Deen to himself seemed at once so void of all difficulties, and so com pletely to meet ail the necessities of the case, that Lanxon was strangely tempted by it. It Avas not even so bad as striking the first bloAv in the case of an expected attack. It was merely restraining the expected assailant from striking the first bloAV. There was an obvious reason, hoAvever, Avhy such a method of procedure should be impossible to a man of honour. For honour held, and indeed seemed to proclaim loudly, that Lanxon's first duty Avas to relieve Djellal-el-Deen \u2014 to raise him from his bed of sickness. There was no question as to his capacity for doing this. That Avhite powder that he had, even whislt sitting in the saloon in this mood of perplexity, mechanically weighed out into two masses of fifteen grains each and carefully en wrapped in paper, Avould, if administered between that hour and nine o'clock the next morning, suffi-"], [158, "MARIAM CHAP. 150 ciently quench the smouldering embers of the fever; a feAv smaller doses, repeated daily, would suffice to prevent its return. Djellal-el-Deen in three or four days, at the furthest, Avould have perfectly recovered from the Aveakness consequent on this day's attack. Lanxon had treated many hundreds of cases of ague in the Persian Gulf during the preceding month, and had never found one to resist the action of unadul terated quinine. It Avas impossible to shelter him self under a doubt of its efficacy, and thus attempt to minimize the results of such a policy of absten tion. His duty Avas not merely clear : it admitted of no question as to the manner in Avhich it should be performed. Yet there Avere other people to be regarded ; and by doing this little evil great good Avould doubtless ensue \u2014 for a time at least. Many moralists there Avere Avho, in a roundabout manner, could prove that his highest duty lay in sacrificing his paltry sense of honour, so that \u2014 Other voices there Avere Avhispering to him in va rious ways, urging him in this direction. One said that it Avould even prove for the benefit of Djellal-el- Deen himself, since it might prevent him from ven turing into danger and perhaps meeting an untime ly end. In the midst of this strife of thought he Avas in. terrupted by the appearance of Rakmah, who came to ask him for the medicine he had told her to come for at this hour. Lanxon gazed at her distraught. Rakmah, look ing at him Avith some astonishment, repeated the question."], [159, "XI MARIAM 151 \" Damn roundabout philosophers ! \" He gave her the poAvders hastily, and she quitted the saloon with some indication of fright ; for though she understood not the Avords, every Eastern has sufficient experience of denunciatory language to recognize easily the gesture and feature movements Avhich usually accompany it in all tongues."], [160, "CHAPTER XII OVER the tranquil surface of the Persian Gulf the Lornadale glided as smoothly as if it Avere of pol ished ice and waves had for ever been banished from its waters. Through the glare and heat of the day, oft emvrapt in a haze of vaporous moisture and fine sand, sometimes saluted by a hot sultry breeze from the deserts of Arabia, at other moments with no movement of the atmosphere around but that created by her OAvn rapid course ; through the awful solemnity, the indescribable beauty of the night, with a thousand rays of light streaming from her decks, and the subdued hum of her humanity rising and losing itself in the immensity and silence above ; apparently alone in the universe, companioned only by those inscrutable guardians of the heavens whose sacred brilliancy has made them, in all ages, objects of peculiar reverence to man in these climes, \u2014 she sped on her holy mission \u2014 holy by reason of its association Avith one of the holiest feelings of humanity : the desire to pay tribute to the memory of a son Avhose life, despite the blemishes Avhich it discovers to our eyes, had been spent in the con stant endeavour to bring it closer to its God and to the justice and freedom Avhich are its birthright."], [161, "MARIAM CHAP. XII 153 Since leaving Bushire the Lornadale had paused at two places, Linga and Bander-Abbas, small ports on the Persian coast, Avhence a few bales of mer chandise had been received, and a dozen or _avo of pilgrims. The latter numbered noAV fully six hun dred. There had been some idea of touching at Muscat, the capital of the Arabian principality of Oman ; but this project fell through, and they rapidly drew near Ras-el-Hadd, a promontory a. hich separates the Gulf of Oman from the Arabian Ocean, Avhere the monsoon wind was blowing in all the intensity of its fury. It is not without design that there has so little been said in these pages touching a point which might, at first sight, appear worthy of rather a prominent position in a narrative Avhich has for one of its central figures that of Christopher Lanxon. His betrothed and his affection for her were merely noticed in a cursory manner in the opening chapter; since then they have not been mentioned. Let not this be imputed to negligence. This narrative does not pretend to portray to the reader in their entirety the lives of any of the characters with which it deals : its business is to carve out from the Avhole of each a certain period of twenty-one days during Avhich they were brought together by circumstances ; and there is necessity that only such and so much of the antecedents of each should be impressed on the reader's mind as to give him a fair idea of the actual state of each during these tAventy-one days. And the difficulty which has to be contended Avith here will readily be understood by those Avho have had experience of so utter and long-continued a change"], [162, "154 MARIAM CHAr. of surroundings as had befallen Lanxon. Man's nature is akin to the Nature which surrounds him ; he receives impressions from the latter, and he can not avoid being SAvayed by them. The longer the exposure, the more decided the change of surround ings, and the younger the individual, the greater will be the influence ; and it is to be borne in mind that Lanxon Avas by temperament peculiarly susceptible to such influences, avid to receive all knoAvledge, to cultivate acquaintance Avith that which Avas foreign to him. It is only when special occasions force man into a state of self-consciousness that holds in one grasp the Avhole of his being that the will rises in its strength to assert the superiority of man over circumstances. As a general rule a man is scarcely conscious of more than himself at the actual mo ment : he drifts along, and only finds, long after perhaps, by sudden contrasts of himself with the old Avorld, the change that has been wrought in him. And such Avas the influence of time and place on Christopher Lanxon that to dilate on the point in question Avould have been to greatly exaggerate its influence on his mind during this period of tAventy one days Avith AvhicfiAve have alone to do Avith. His betrothed lived in a Avorld altogether different from that Avhich at present surrounded him ; the associa tions Avhich Avere inseparably bound up with her were entirely absent ; it is not to be Avondered at that she seemed to occupy another sphere than that in Avhich he moved. If this had been forcibly brought to Lanxon's consciousness, he Avould cer tainly have denied it ; he Avould have retired to seek solitude in some private corner, and then, by means"], [163, "MARIAM XII 155 of an out-turning of the hidden recesses of his being and an exercise of his vivid imagination, have lived once more, perchance for the space of two hours, in that close touch and spiritual communion Avhich should doubtless ahvays exist betAvixt tAvo persons Avho are engaged. But there Avas nothing so far to give rise in him to this introspective phase ; and he therefore drifted on, utterly unconscious that he was so drifting. Shortly after one o'clock on the eighth day of the voyage the Lornadale passed Ras-el-Hadd. The change of Aveather and climate made itself felt in stantaneously. Behind her she left a sea as calm as it possibly could be, and a heat as stifling as it is Avithin the poAver of man to endure Avith a tolerable degree of comfort. Noav she found herself amidst a mass of rolling, heaving billoAvs that tossed her about most unmercifully, and broke over her, and drenched the amazed pilgrims ; whilst the Avind made all their curtains and their tents stream and strain about so that they hurriedly packed up their belongings and transferred themselves beloAv. This Avind Avas cold and damp, and it acted on the limp and perspiring ship's company like a tonic, bracing them up, till they capered about and Avhistled, and sang and danced on the decks, in their joy : and then they hurried to put on some warmer clothing. The Avind threatened to carry the awnings away, so they were removed ; and noAv the Lornadale commenced the second stage of her voyage under an altogether new appearance. Of course the change of circumstances Avas re garded in an entirely different light by the pilgrims :"], [164, "156 MARIAM CHAP. by three o'clock there remained not a single one on the upper deck. Words cannot paint the distress that seized upon Leila, the young Avise of our friend the Bagdadi, Avhen it became abundantly clear to her, by reason of the groAving violence of the Avind and the increasing shoAvers of spray that the Avaves persisted in discharging into their midst, that they would finally be compelled to vacate the domicile that had been the object of such tender care and had won in her affections the place of a home. It Avas of no use to cover herself up, to pull her ' izar ' tightly over her, to add the thicker protection of a Persian rug, to endeavour to keep out the spray by fortifying with drapery the open side toAvards the sea. Vain Avere their efforts ; disheartening the results. The elements Avere not to be conquered ; the Avhole structure SAvayed ominously and strained its bonds : further resistance Avas madness. The rest of the pilgrims had already stampeded beloAv ; the outlook over the decks had become damp and desolate ; the sailors Avere already preparing, under orders, to take doAvn the aAvnings, Avhich impeded the ship considerably in its course against the wind. Then it Avas that Im-Brahim Avas induced to listen to the Avords of Avisdom that floAved from the lips of her eloquent husband, persuading her in the direc tion of folloAving the general example. She suc cumbed Avith a bitter Avail, and having done so much Avent still further and collapsed entirely, folloAving in that the example of her mother.

But Abu-Brahim, the Bagdadi, did not lose his temper, but only gazed mournfully at them, heaved a gentle sigh, and proceeded to carry them doAvn beloAv carefully one by one and deposit them in the tent of Rakmah, who had had the wisdom to settle beloAv from the very first (whilst Jusuf Effendi, now well recovered from fever, was sent by his wife to take his chance amongst the body of pilgrims) ; then he devoted the next hour to chasing his goods and chattels about the decks \u2014 for they had already been dispersed \u2014 and having secured them, laid himself doAvn below amidst the general crowd, and surrendered himself to the uncomfortable sensations that Avere gradually overpoAvering him. The ladies on the quarter-deck, likeAvise, made as hasty an adjournment of their open-air mode of life as circumstances Avould permit ; but amidst the pitching and tossing to Avhich the Lornadale was now subjected, the saloon at the stern-end of the vessel could not but prove a sorry location for people liable to sea-sickness. Ayesha was, indeed, beyond all power of speech and thought ; she lay like a mass of inanimate matter, and to her it signified little where she Avas located. Things could not very well be worse, and she adopted in face of them a lethargic state of mind eminently philosophical and comfort ing. But it was different with Im-Abdallah and the rest, who retained sufficient possession of their senses to suffer acutely ; and to them matters in the saloon appeared no better than on the quarter-deck. For although they were not subjected to the agony of gazing on the huge waves as they came rolling"], [166, "158 MARIAM CHAP. doAvn upon them, yet the extraordinary manner in which the ship appeared at one moment to be flying up to the sky, causing them to tumble together in a confused and breathless mass at one end of the cabin, and the next to be falling doAvn a bottomless abyss, and that Avith sickening rapidity, causing them once more to roll about Avith muttered excla mations of surprise and anger, until they were jammed against the bulkhead at the other, proved a series of experiences which, so soon as their con fusion alloAved them opportunities of thought and action, they felt they could not possibly endure. Life at this rate Avas not Avorth living. So they sent a message to Ismar commanding him either to obtain another location for them on board the ship which was less subjected to such rapid changes of equilibrium, or to compel the captain to put about and to return to the calm Avaters which they had left behind them. Ismar Avas naturally a tender-hearted man, and, having himself recovered in some measure from the sensations that his female relatives complained of, Avas able to treat their complaints Avith the full sym pathy Avhich they deserved. He accordingly Avent to the captain and held a palaver Avith him. Captain Pohvarth Avas perfectly Avilling that the ladies should occupy any other part of the ship they could secure ; only that was the difficulty, for it Avas probable that they Avould not find it easy to discover any unoccu pied site that was preferable to the saloon. Ismar descended the hatcliAvays and explored the main deck, noAV croAvded to such a degree that it was a matter of difficulty to pass along it from one end of"], [167, "XII MARIAM 159 the ship to the other. He discovered, in the course of his peregrinations, the quarters of the engineers amidships, alongside of the engine-room. After a stiff bout of bargaining, in which Ismar found these engineers more than a match for himself \u2014 they feel ing that they had the Avhip-hand of him in the matter, and not at all affected by the description of the ladies' sufferings \u2014 it Avas arranged that, for a handsome consideration over and above the pas sage-money, the ladies should have the use of the engineers' mess-room until they came into calmer waters. He then repaired in triumph to the ladies' quarters and announced to them the welcome intelli gence. Im-Abdallah uttered a few exclamations over the rapacity of these Feringhees. But they were not in a position to dispute any extortion. They were confident they could not live through the night in their present situation. So they urged their attendants to Avake up and prepare the neAV quarters ; and as soon as these were ready, the whole hareem repaired thither. Here matters Avere a good deal more comfortable. The movement of the ship was gentler ; and in the sudden and unexpected cold of the damp monsoon wind, the Avarmth derived from the engine-room AA7as not objectionable. The main deck, Avhich lay beloAv the upper or spar deck, and had both light and air admitted to it through the fore and mid hatches, presented a scene of the most indescribable confusion. As things ordinarily go, it had been pretty Avell filled before the Lornadale had passed Ras-el-Hadd, whilst yet half if not more of the pilgrims Avere located on the spar deck. Driven by the wind and the Avater and the terrors of the SAvelling waves, the latter had simply"], [168, "160 MARIAM CHAP tumbled on to the deck beloAv, which afforded shel ter, anyAvhere and everyAvhere. They lay there apparently bereft of their senses. It must be borne in mind that many of these people had never even heard of the sea before their embarkation ; that most of them had never been on it ; and that cer tainly none of them, with the exception of Ismar and perhaps half-a-dozen others, had ever experi enced the agonies of sea-sickness and the turbu lence of the stormy waves before. Sea-sickness was not to them, therefore, merely an unavoidable but expected calamity. It was something neAV, porten tous, terrible, arising from an unknoAvn cause, be tokening to their minds dread possibilities of the mysterious future. They felt as they had never felt before. They saAV everybody else around them taken in the same Avay, prostrate, poAverless in face of this all-pervading but invisible enemy. They Avere accustomed to terra firma ; all their philoso phies were founded on it, and assumed it as the basis of all things. No Avonder that the spasms and upheavals and declensions of the ocean Avave scat tered them to the Avinds. For the moment they felt like neAv-born babes entering upon an unknown world, of whose laAvs, customs, and language they Avere entirely ignorant. They saw the crew and officers looking happier and more at ease than ever, and sometimes capering in evident delight on the decks ; so they naturally assumed that all this per turbation of Nature was the handhvork of some demon in league with these Feringhees : which re flection made them feel, more than ever, out of it \u2014 to use an expressive colloquialism. So they lay in patient apathy, Avaiting till this terrible thing should"], [169, "XII MARIAM 161 come to an end, careless of themselves and of every thing that passed around them. It must have been a severe shock to their systems to find that, notAvithstanding all their faith, the might and love of their Prophet had not availed to save them from the fury of the deep. Rumours had spread throughout the ship that they Avere to expect bad Aveather after Ras-el-Hadd ; but to the last moment the vast majority had treated these rumours with contemptuous indifference ; those that suspected the truth had stood on deck as they neared the point, Avatch in hand, alternately glancing at it and all around them \u2014 as the captain had even predicted the hour Avhen the change was to take place \u2014 and employing their lips Avith the SAvift murmur of prayer. But Avhen the hour came, Avatches were put away and prayers abandoned. It Avas part of Lanxon's duty, as medical officer, to make a tour tAvice a day throughout the Avhole ship, for the purpose of keeping an eye on its sani tary condition. On these tours of inspection he was accompanied by the chief mate and half-a-dozen men, ' soAvars ' \u2014 Indians, \u2014 Avhose function it Avas to cleanse the decks. Two of them carried brooms, tAvo others disinfectants, and the remainder large bottles of medicine, one in each arm. During the period of fine Aveather these tours of inspection were marked with the honours that attended the progress of a procession of triumph. The sowars Avith brooms skirmished ahead, clearing the way with great sAveeps of their implements, and loud shouts of, \"Way, way! make way for the great Hakim, the light of the earth ; Avho has derived his knoAvledge from heaven and is filled Avith the wisdom M"], [170, "162 MARIAM CHAP. of Allah ! And approach with dread, 0 ye blessed but unhappy believers Avhose bodies groan under the infirmities of the flesh : approach \u2014 out of the way, O lazy and irreverent animal ! \u2014 approach so that the light of his countenance may penetrate into your souls and cure your ills ; for to-day is the day appointed by Allah for your salvation.\" Lanxon folloAved next, walking with becoming dignity and stateliness, Avhilst the rest stalked behind carrying their various bottles Avith an air of extreme unction. But Avhen the Avhole body of pilgrims massed them selves on the main-deck, the work of sanitation be came Avell-nigh impossible. They blocked the alleys so completely, and Avere so unable or so umvilling to move, that progress Avas only possible over the spraAvling bodies. Farther away from the hatches and the light which streamed in through them, the ob scurity Avas such that Lanxon found it necessary to have tAvo of the soAvars precede him Avith big lanterns. The evil was intensified by the fact that the tents erected by such of the Avomen as had from the first selected the main-deck as their habitat Avere in every case out of proportion in size to the number of tenants they contained. One family, for example, that numbered three adults and three children, occupied a space sufficient to accommodate thirty men. To this abuse of courtesy Lanxon had said nothing Avhen matters Avere fairly comfortable ; for it was no business of his if the men thought fit to pinch themselves in this manner for the convenience of the women. But Avhen the crush became so great as to hinder the due performance of his own duties he thought it time to interfere. He at first ordered the soAvars to drive the men aAvay from the"], [171, "XII MARIAM 163 alleys and places which Avere intended to be used for paths, and Avhen they piteously remonstrated and asked Avhere they should go, told them there was plenty of room if they could only force the tent-holders to moderate their dominions, and then urged them to encroach upon the latter. But his exhortations were of no avail. They assented to him, suffered them selves to be driven away \u2014 for Lanxon was very popu lar, and they would stand more from him than from any other of the officers or the crew \u2014 and then re turned, but never attempted, so far as Lanxon could see, to act on his suggestions. Therefore he went to the Avomen themselves and expostulated gently Avith them, representing to them how matters stood, and requesting them as a favour to curtail their possessions. But this only produced a good deal of feminine recrimination of the most extreme kind. Lanxon lost his patience. No doubt there was something to be said on their side. They had will ingly contented themselves with the loAver deck, which was much less comfortable a situation than the upper on account of the better ventilation and lighting of the latter; and because most of the pilgrims preferred, Avhilst the fine Aveather lasted, to remain above, they had been able to secure their ample quarters. Now, when the pilgrims above had become disgusted Avith the quarters they had origi nally preferred, they came below and made things un pleasant for the colony already there. The men, not having tents wherewith to mark out definitely their allotments, had been compelled to submit to this en croachment and accept the inevitable. The women, hoAvever, did not feel inclined to do so : perchance sustained in their obstinacy by the conviction that"], [172, "164 MARIAM CHAP. they Avere quite secure from compulsion if they only took care to make sufficient noise in their OAvn de fence. Lanxon, hoAvever, searched out the masters of these various households, and threatened them with all manner of proceedings if they did not at once bestir themselves and secure the performance of his Avishes. They languidly arose, and promised on their heads that everything should be arranged as he desired. Thereupon they harangued their spouses ; but the latter retorted in a thousand tongued manner ; and presently from all quarters of the main deck there arose a great volume of Availing and sobbing, intermingled with a fine shrill vein of vituperation and abuse directed against Lanxon. And Avhen this came to an end, everybody sat doAvn as before and no alteration Avas effected. The chief mate Avas very desirous of pulling the tents ruthlessly doAvn about the ears of their occu pants, by Avay of impressing on them a due sense of their OAvn position, and settling the question. And this measure Lanxon Avas resolved to carry out as a last resource, if everything else failed. For it was simply impossible, as matters stood, to secure a proper sanitation of the ship ; and if an epidemic broke out amongst the croAvd in their present condi tion, the prospect Avould be gloomy in the extreme. Yet such a violent measure might be productive of a catastrophe. At his Avits' end, Lanxon regained the spar-deck and sat himself down on the edge of the middle hatclnvay, and gazed in forlorn misery at the Avaves, and Aviped the perspiration that streamed from his face \u2014 for beloAv it Avas as hot as in an oven \u2014 and cooled it in the refreshing breeze. Ismar strode up and doAvn beside the hatclnvay."], [173, "MARIAM 165 XII The Avind, bloAving up his cloak into a kind of balloon behind him, made his progress a matter of difficulty one way, and in returning rather inclined it to be too precipitate. But Ismar possessed a soul above trifles. Constant motion and fresh air recom mended themselves to his judgment, and he Avas de termined to have them in spite of all obstacles. Noav and then, hoAvever, the ship gave a lurch which nearly made him lose his equilibrium. Certainly the sea was not likely to be favoured in Ismar's conclu sions on things in general. One other figure, arrayed in the picturesque garb of the East, appeared on the deck \u2014 that of Sheikh Salim. But he was seated some distance for'ard, almost hidden by a huge ventilator ; and his eyes seemed lost in the contemplation of infinity, though now and then they strayed towards the staggering figure that Avrestled Avith the Avind. \" Women,\" said Lanxon, sententiously, as Ismar passed him, \"are beyond the comprehension of men.\" At the same time he eyed the farther figure in some doubt. \" Ah,\" said Ismar, pausing for a moment, \" that is beyond question. We came to that conclusion many years ago.\" And he continued his march. \"The only persons capable of comprehending Avomen are Avomen,\" continued Ismar as he returned. \" But Avhat is the matter ? \" Lanxon told him. \" You Avill find it very difficult to make those Avomen do Avhat you Avish them to do,\" said Ismar, warningly. \" Then I shall pull the tents doAvn ! \" exclaimed Lanxon, hotly."], [174, "166 MARIAM CHAT. XII \" Better not \u2014 better not,\" returned Ismar. \" Allah take care of you if you do ! There is no doubt that you Avill get into trouble.\" \" Have you,\" he said as he came past once more \u2014 \" have you spoken to the ladies of the Sheikh about the matter? \" Lanxon's face expressed a sudden sense of relief as he caught Ismar's meaning ; and he turned and made doAvn the hatclway Avith exceeding speed. The engineers' quarters and those of the mates, on either side of the engine-room, lay betAvixt the tAvo halves of the main-deck. Lanxon made his Avay to the mess-room, Avhere the ladies of the quarter-deck were noAV comfortably established. When he opened the door, Mariam and Wasseefy Avere sitting up ap parently in the possession of good health ; the others lay at rest in the recumbent position. In a feAv Avords he explained hoAv matters stood, and asked Mariam to come and use her influence with the re calcitrant Avomen. Im-Abdallah Avas aAvake, but not, hoAvever, in a fit state to sympathize Avith him. She exclaimed dejectedly : \" By Allah, it matters not ; let us all die.\" Mariam herself did not seem to be over delighted at Lanxon's appeal. She raised many objections, and urged on Lanxon the adoption of a more philosophic and contented state of mind. But Lanxon stuck to his point, and entreated her AA'ith great pressure, until finally she yielded and, at tended by Wasseefy, proceeded to execute his wishes. She visited tent after tent, using hard Avords Avithout scruple Avherever they were required, and in half an hour effected Avhat Lanxon had repeatedly failed in since the night before."], [175, "CHAPTER XIII It Avas with a curious mingling of sensations that Lanxon Avatched the ease with Avhich Mariam, around whom late events had created in his thoughts a haze of romance that did not tend to diminish the interest with which he was inclined to regard her, overcame what to him had proved an insurmount able difficulty. Perhaps her success engendered in him just a tinge of disgust : he was human. But he could not help admiring her powers of command, her administrative tact. She spoke as one who had to be obeyed, and yet seemed not to hurt the feel ings of those Avho had to obey. She ridiculed them, but in such a manner that they laughed at them selves and joined her in vieAving their own obstinacy as ridiculous. She hurried them up into action, and only appeared to be giving expression to their own desire to hurry. In a word, she intimately under stood the art of coercing a people who resented the idea of being coerced. \"By Jove,\" muttered Lanxon, as he watched the lively movements of her figure and listened to the outpouring of her lips, \" I do not Avonder at the ambition of that felloAv Ismar ! \" Henceforth Mariam acted as Lanxon's lieutenant"], [176, "168 MARIAM CHAP. Avith regard to the Avomen on board, of whom there Avere about sixty. For the longer the state of over croAvding continued, the Avorse did matters tend to become ; and it finally resolved itself into an inces sant labour to keep them in a tolerable condition. It Avas all that Lanxon could do to attend to the men: he had constantly to superintend everything himself, for if he delegated his duties to the chief mate, the result invariably Avas a roAv royal. Ismar's influence Avas of great service ; and several times Avhen the tension had Avell-nigh reached the point at which diplomatic relations cease, they Avere smoothed over again by his intervention. But Avithout Ma riam it Avould have been impossible to keep the tents in a proper condition. For, Avhereas the Avhole of each half of the main-deck which Avas not encur tained could be comprehended in one general survey, each tent necessarily required special attention. And although Lanxon had no scruple in entering each tent Avhenever he Avent his rounds, yet he could not very Avell stay in them the length of time that Avas often necessary for the proper superintendence of anything that he desired to be carried out. And the Avomen Avere A-ery much more obstinate in this respect than the men. With the latter, if they were insolent or dilatory in obeying his orders, he could make use of hard Avords and even bloAA's. But he dared not act in the same Avay toAvards the women. Once after a particularly prolonged and irritating verbal conflict betAvixt Lanxon and one of the latter, one of his ' soAvars ' joined in, and, Avithout mincing matters, gave her his OAvn opinion of her conduct. Thereupon there arose such a hubbub as had never"], [177, "MARIAM 169 XHI before occurred on board the ship. The woman Availed out in words of song that she was insulted, and began to sob and rattle out that shrill cry so common among Arab women, called the ' Avellaloua ' (Avhence Ave derive our ' allelujah '), which they use indiscriminately in times of joy, sorrow, or anger, but with a difference of intonation in each case quite sufficient to express the cause of their emotion. The other women took up the 'Avellaloua,' desisting, if momentarily engaged, from their labours so as to give to this appalling method of demonstration its due effect. This Avas at the fore-half of the main deck ; but the cry was taken up in the after-half, and even those stricken badly with sea-sickness began to raise their heads and groAvl ; others, who had the use of their loAver limbs, began to mass themselves around the scene of operations. In vain Lanxon tried to calm the excitement \u2014 to pacify the Avoman whose lacerated feelings were the cause of all this upheaval of sentiment. She proved deaf to his cajoleries. In a fine shoAV of hysterical frenzy, she squatted on the floor, rocked herself to and fro Avith a sad and expressive rhythm, alternately giving vent to a piercing ' wellaloua ' \u2014 the cackling rever beration of which came back to her strengthened by the added chorus of all her numerous and distant sympathizers \u2014 and sobbing out in the chanting music of the Arabs her OAvn version of her Avrongs. In face of all this Lanxon was fain to draAv back his forces and beat a hasty retreat up the hatchAvay. Made Aviser by similar experiences, Lanxon no longer attempted to supervise the feminine portion of his charge, and, after some persuasion, succeeded"], [178, "170 MARIAM CHAr. in enlisting Mariam's sympathies and good offices to such a degree that she took this Avork into her OAvn hands. She performed her task admirably. She would take her orders from him after his round \u2014 sometimes object to them pretty freely if they did not meet Avith her approval \u2014 and see them carried out. \"You must make that woman there \u2014 sheAvith the spotted veil \u2014 take up her carpets and all her furni ture. I Avant the place sAvabbed out Avith this stuff \u2014 carbolic acid.\" \" Very Avell. By Allah, she shall do so or lose her head ! \" \" And that other Avoman \u2014 over in that corner. I Avon't have her cooking that confounded steAV all day long. Why, she fills the whole atmosphere Avith its smell.\" \" By Allah, but that is exactly Avhat she does it for. Poor Avise of Abdallah ! She Avould Aveep in deed if she heard you speak thus of her stew. Why, she is proud of it. She is prouder of that steAV than of her husband and her children. She says the steam from it will cure every disease under the sun. And the people believe her. And many of them have been better of this terrible sickness \u2014 Avhich you say you cannot cure \u2014 since she has taken to prepare it. Nay, by the life of the Prophet, think better of her steAV and reverse your decision Avith regard to it. Say, what shall it be ? \" \" Well \u2014 you knoAv\u2014 if \u2014 if it is really true that the people feel better \u2014 \" \" But don't I tell you that the people do feel better\u2014 or are you presuming to doubt my Avord? \""], [179, "MARIAM XIII 171 \" Nay, nay, lengthen your patience somewhat, most righteous Mariam. I should not dare to doubt even the fraction of a Avord that came from your mouth.\" \" Well, then, shall the Avise of Abdallah go on cooking her stew in peace ? \" \" I suppose she had better, if it gives the people pleasure.\" \" Ah, so should you speak. Allah will be gra cious to you for your forbearance.\" Henceforth Lanxon had no reason to feel uneasy on the score of the women. It was somewhat re markable how Mariam, only lately so haughty and independent, would submit to his directions and carry them out to the very word, as if it Avere the most natural thing in the Avorld for her to be ordered about in this manner. No doubt the roughness of the weather and the rocking of the ship had a good deal to do Avith this subtle change in her. For although she might be free from actual sickness, yet, unaccustomed as she was to her present circum stances, the constant heaving and motion could not fail to fill her Avith a sort of uneasiness Avhich ren dered her very much less decided in her vieAvs and independent in her bearing. No doubt, also, the very circumstances that made her less certain of her self tended to invest this young Englishman in her eyes with something of the air of a demi-god ; for he appeared not merely unaffected by them, but actually exhilarated and raised out of himself : and he naturally gained by contrast with the fallen state of her OAvn countrymen. Strange to say, however, Lanxon himself, though he acknowledged and con-"], [180, "172 MARIAM CHAP. tinually thanked her for her Avell-performed services, never suspected that there Avas anything out of the Avay in her demeanour to him. He had come to re gard his acquaintance with Mariam in the same light as he Avould one Avith a girl in his OAvn country. He never reflected hoAv much more such an intimacy \u2014 though, according to the canons of his OAvn society, it Avas no intimacy at all \u2014 meant to Mariam; Iioav much more her toleration of it also implied. In fact, there Avas such an utter absence about Mariam of all those little signs which he had been accustomed to consider the certain indications of awakening love, that if any one had suggested to him that she ac tually regarded him in that light, he Avould have exclaimed at the absurdity of the notion. On the morning of the fourth day of the ladies' sojourn in the engineers' quarters and their experi ence of the monsoon, Lanxon succeeded in inducing Mariam to brave the horrors of the raging deep and make her appearance on deck. She came up the ladder from their alley Avith marked timidity and hesitation, folloAved by Wasseefy, Avho Avas by no means pleased Avith this new freak, and appeared to think that her mistress must be losing her senses under the umvonted circumstances. Once on deck, the boisterous Avind and the flying spray made them draAv their coverings closely around them, and the full occupation that their senses derived from the necessity of preventing themselves from being caught up by the former and bloAvn out onto the sea dis tracted their attention for some time from Avhat Avas to them so aAvful a scene. The monsoon blows from the Zanzibar coast northAvards up the south-"], [181, "XIII MARIAM 173 eastern coast of Arabia, strikes Ras-el-Hadd and turns sharp round, Avithout affecting the Gulf of Oman, to fly southwards doAvn the Indian coast. Noav the Lornadale Avas proceeding in a south westerly direction down the Arabian coast : right in the teeth, therefore, of this wind. The waves came rolling straight against her, and, as the wind was a constant one for six months and had already been blowing a good portion of that time, they were pretty big. Fortunately the Lornadale Avas lightly laden, and she dodged each Avave and shot up its crest with marvellous and successful agility. But of course this made things all the Avorse for those who were inclined to suffer from her movement. As they stood there shivering in their fluttering draperies there came along a vast rolling mountain of sea. It Avas a grand sight \u2014 to Lanxon ; an aAvful one to Mariam and Wasseefy. The holloAv of it, as it crested itself toAvards the ship Avhich it Avas rapidly approaching, was black, the sun being on the other side ; and this blackness, and the solidity of its ap pearance, and the dull roar with which it gathered together its accumulating forces, were quite sufficient to strike terror into the hearts of any not accustomed to the sea. Straight as a dart, the ship \u2014 looking oh ! so little in the immense trough in which it lay \u2014 rose up on end from the depths and made right for the topmost curl of the crest ; but failed by a little in its gallant endeavour, so that a considerable volume of water swept its decks, but not sufficient to seri ously incommode the people below. What did reach them, however, did not afford them pleasure, and they recorded their feelings by a chorus of"], [182, "MARIAM CHAP. 174 faint groans, interspersed by a feAv more vigorous yells \u2014 the latter bearing evidence to the fact that some of them Avere already fast recovering the accus tomed use of their poAvers. Both Mariam and Was seefy screamed and coAvered doAvn on the deck under shelter of the engine-room skylights ; in Avhich posi tion, finding themselves unexpectedly secure and comfortable, they remained. Lanxon laughed at their fright ; at which Mariam remonstrated. \" The sea is a cruel and implacable enemy,\" she said, \" and we expect no mercy at his hands. Know ing the sea to be Avater and ourselves to be made of clay, Avho will wonder if Ave suffer from its furious attacks?\" \"Well,\" said Lanxon, consolingly, \"you will not have very much more of its violence.\" \" El Hamdulilah \u2014 Allah be praised ! \" said Ma riam. \" When shall Ave once more be delighted Avith the smell of the SAveet-scented breezes of security, after having been so long affected by the nauseous exhalations of the irritated Avaves ? \" \" It is Avonderful. You have been in their midst barely three days.\" \" And it seems to you as if that were a short period ? \" \" It is not long.' \" Verily you have little regard for the feelings of others.\" At this moment Sheikh Salim passed them, Avalk ingaft. Lanxon, Avhose back was turned to him, did not notice him. \" Nay, indeed,\" he said, \" I feel for you greatly.\""], [183, "XIII MARIAM 175 \" And yet you see us suffer.\" \" But one ahvays suffers the first feAv days. I have likeAvise suffered.\" \" You do not suffer now ; you laugh at our tribula tion.\" \" That is because I have become accustomed to it. If you were in the midst of such weather as this for tAvo or three Aveeks \u2014 \" \" Nay,\" cried Mariam, \"do not mention it. Allah preserve me from such a calamity! \" \" You would come to laugh at it too.\" \" What say you, Wasseefy? \" said Mariam \" I am laughing already \u2014 but not at the Avaves. \" But indeed \u2014 \" said Lanxon. \" And the Avise of my uncle,\" interrupted Mariam, \" would she also \u2014 \" She stopped suddenly, and her eyes appeared to Lanxon, even through the veil, to shoot past him and fix themselves on some farther object with a stare of angry amazement, Avhilst her mouth shut tightly, and the smooth surface of her broAV became upheaved and depressed and puckered in the sem blance of a froAvn. 'Lanxon turned involuntarily, and met the gaze of Sheikh Salim, Avho, bending his head as he staggered past them against the Avind Avith fluttering and straining garments, yet failed not to eye them with a glance of keen intelligence.

The compliment had for her a peculiar meaning, being out of the Avorld Avherein such compliments are current in an al most meaningless fashion ; a circumstance of which Lanxon possibly Avas not sufficiently conscious. It AA7as not exactly a blush, but rather the flush of glad ness, as if some doubt had suddenly been removed from her mind, or some Avish gratified. \" That Avas Avell said,\" she remarked, after a pause. \" But I never revealed my beauty to him ...

But Mariam restrained him with a sudden assumption of gentle authority that rendered her exquisitely charming ; it bridged over, as it were, the gulf that had hitherto seemingly yawned betAveen them. \" Nay, by the life of the Prophet, I will have you do no such thing!

People of different nations need have no difficulty in understanding each other, provided their thoughts are straight and equally honest ; but when one starts with the determination to deceive, he has the other at a cruel disadvantage. Thus with Djellal-el-Deen : in Avords, he Avould dis arm you with a sentence ; in actions, he Avould overthrow you Avhen you thought that nothing but peace or submission pervaded his thoughts. Who am I that I should allow you to venture yourself in the manner you propose ? You Avould incur danger, and might trnvart your OAvn intentions Avithout hindering those of Djellal-el-Deen.\" Struck by the sense of her reasoning, the truth of Avhich Avas indisputable, and mollified by her manner, Lanxon paused. Wasseefy, Avho had been listening to the conversation in silence, noAV gave them the benefit of her thoughts. \"Why all this talk ?\" she said. \"Tell Ismar; he is our guardian. He will manage Djellal-el-Deen, and strike him doAvn if necessary. In the name of Allah, leave it to him.\" There Avas a cold quaintness in Wasseefy's manner of expressing herself that struck Avith a sense of contrast on the heated souls of Mariam and Lanxon, and made them both laugh. This laugh possessed sedative qualities. It sufficed to quell the last Avaves of irritation that agitated the feelings of each ; so that their eyes fortlvwith bespoke nothing but the most perfect mutual good-humour, and even Mariam appeared to have lost consciousness of the anxieties that had but a moment ago filled her thoughts. \" Well, so be it ! \""], [193, "185 XIV MARIAM \"You Avill tell Ismar?\" \"To Ismar I will tell all.\" \" Ha ! so should you speak \u2014 like one possessing both good intentions and good sense.\" \" But how comes it,\" said Lanxon, \" that Djellal el-Deen has not ere noAv been recognized by one of your party ? \" \" Nay, there is not much to Avonder at in that . . .

He had his black robe Avell tucked in around him, so that it only slightly fluttered in the breeze and did not disturb the air of sublime stillness that pervaded his Avhole figure. In respect of this sublime stillness of fea tures, Avhich is much prized even amongst civilized nations as the demeanour par excellence which at tends high breeding, Orientals, and especially Ara bians, may rank as the most highly bred of all crea tures ; for it is peculiarly characteristic of them. But it does not ahvays serve as a true index to Avhat lies beneath the surface. This Avas the first time that Ismar had spoken to Djellal-el-Deen ; nor can it be doubted that the manner in Avhich he heard himself addressed startled him. But no observing stranger Avould have dis covered that Djellal-el-Deen had receh7ed a shock ; had Lanxon been present, he AA7ould \u2014 though some what acquainted Avith these peculiarities of behaviour \u25a0certainly have doubted the possibility of Djellal-"], [199, "XV MARIAM 191 el-Deen's harbouring any nefarious designs that in volved deep calculation, beneath a countenance that remained so solemnly placid in face of a bloAV which might have been expected to discompose it utterly.

Then folloAved a full half-hour of equally placid and desultory conversation ; interjectional phrases ; pious ejaculations ; philosophical reflections : mixed up and diluted with long intervals of silence, during Avhich each gazed Avith painful blankness of expres sion into space \u2014 a conversation entirely void of any real meaning or sequence, at least to the Western mind, so that its transmission to the reader would only raise in him a doubt concerning the sanity of the parties concerned.

Ismar had left him with a set purpose that be tokened some hostility to Djellal-el-Deen ; but their manner, as they languidly spoke, or shrugged their shoulders, or paused in silence, seemed to him utter ly opposed to earnestness of intention. All of a sudden a change occurred in the scene. Ismar half rose and leant fonvard toAvards Djellal-el- Deen ; his robe freed itself and Avhirled back Avith a mad flutter at the abrupt change of position ; and Avith flashing eyes he appeared to be hurling some intemperate language at Djellal-el-Deen. But it Avas over in a minute ; he fell back again, secured his robe, and appeared to relapse into placidity ; nor did Djellal-el-Deen appear to be disturbed or attempt to make a corresponding demonstration. Ismar had made an attempt to draAv the conversa tion to a head out of the hazy mist of meaningless phrases in Avhich it Avas emvrapt ; but Avith a result that startled him in a manner that far exceeded any impression he Avas able to effect on Djellal-el-Deen. \" Is it your devout intention to perform the Avhole pilgrimage ? \" he said. \" Inshallah.\" \" It is a Avorthy proceeding.\" \" Those Avho observe the ordinances of the Prophet are blessed.

Such has been the observance of the sacred month from time imme morial.\" \" O Mohamed ! O Prophet of Allah !

Ismar Avas taken aback. \"How?\" \" There is no doubt of it.\" \" By the Prophet ! explain your words.\" Djellal-el-Deen looked at him, and for the first time spoke without that mannerism which to a stranger, at least, must have savoured of affecta tion. \" Listen to me, O Ismar-Ben-Ali,\" he said. \" I say you are blind, because you have your eyes fixed on the horizon and regard not that which is at your feet.

Allah alone knoAvs the beginnings and the endings of all things . . . it is sufficient for me to do my present duty. Nay, I am not blind \u2014 by Allah, I am not blind ! \" Swift as lightning the lurid glare of wrath had spread over the countenance of Djellal-el-Deen at the first part of this speech ; but the amazement that folloAved the succeeding Avords was of such a nature that it quite droAvned all feelings of resentment, and left in its place a sense of beAvilderment that caused his features to resume their pose of solemn indiffer ence. Such sentiments he had possibly heard of, but in his experience had never conceived it possible that they should form matter of practice. \" Every one to his taste,\" he muttered placidly. \" Even so,\" quoth Ismar. \" What must be shall be, O Djellal-el-Deen, despite all human interfer ence ! \" Djellal-el-Deen shrugged his shoulders gently. \" Without doubt,\" he murmured. \" Allah is great ! \" \" Allah is great,\" repeated Ismar Avith emphasis."], [203, "XV MARIAM 195 \" Let not the utterance of your mouth be Avithout meaning to your mind, O Djellal-el-Deen, lest evil befall you ! \" \" Estafferallah ! may Allah forbid ! \" For a few moments longer they sat in absolute silence ; then Ismar, in whom the adroit counter charge of his opponent had aroused so great a per turbation of thought that he felt it beyond his poAver to continue with advantage a duel Avherein the first importance attached to a perfect equanimity of mind, arose and quitted the spot. He came back to Lanxon with an aspect differing Avidely from that with Avhich he had left him. From beneath lowering broAvs his eyes flashed Avith no gentle emotion, Avhilst at intervals his lips gave vent to short snatches of violent language. Indeed, despite the placid exterior they affect, Arabians are one of the most highly nervous and excitable races of mankind. And the words of Djellal-el-Deen had caused the blood to floAV afresh from a wound which he had been at much trouble to stanch, Avhich he thought had been so securely bandaged and treated that it must be well-nigh healed. Shot for a purpose no doubt that had failed, the shaft had yet struck him to the quick, and caused in him an agony such as oft drives men out of their senses. He marched up and doAvn beside Lanxon, without offering to sit or to com municate Avith him by word of mouth ; and to one or two questions addressed to him by the latter he only responded by impatient shrugs of his shoulders. The matter of course was not one which he could narrate to Lanxon ; nor, indeed, was he in a mood to converse Avith him on any subject with equa-"], [204, "196 MARIAM CHAP. nimity. To Lanxon it only therefore seemed that something unpleasant had occurred. \" Has Djellal-el-Deen been married ? \" he asked presently. He is married.\" Ah ! That is a vile institution of yours.\" What is ? \" Polygamy.\" Ismar shrugged his shoulders and passed on. \" In an absolute sense, I grant you,\" he said, as he came back. \" It is better to possess one piece of gold than many pieces of silver ; there is less incon venience in the carriage and in the guarding of it : and the gold coin is of a more stable value, it is not Avorth to-day so much and to-morroAv so much, and it is therefore more to be relied on, and alloAvs its possessor to rest in peace. But if one cannot secure a gold coin, one is fain to have several silver coins. FeAv men of integrity and Avisdom Avould crave after more than one Avise, if that one Avere a good one ; for a multiplicity of Avives does not ahvays multiply the happiness of a man, but generally carries Avith it much annoyance and expense. Mohamed himself never looked at another Avoman whilst Khadijah Avas alive ; and though so much his senior in years, she exercised an influence over him that few wives can boast of, despite his own pre-eminence over all the men of his day : an influence Avhich he himself con tinually acknoAvledged even to the day of his death.

Indeed, to judge by the rapidly accumu lating fervour of her fancies, she was tending the right way to set up for a prophetess on her own account. Her imagination had an all-embracing character about it which sufficed to envelop obsta cles from ordinary vision, if it did not exactly sur mount them, and formed an eminently suitable qualification for such a post. She was finally, how ever, smothered in her aspirations by Im-Abdallah, Avho, though she had never been so prostrate as Ayesha, yet seemed to recover more slowly, and in a moment of exasperation abruptly declared that all these sensations could not possibly come from the sea, but must proceed from the devil. Ayesha, who, in common with all the other members of the estab lishment, held Im-Abdallah 's information on such subjects in great reverence, relapsed, after this au thoritative declaration, into the ordinary condition of a sea-sick mortal. Indeed Avhen Lanxon ques-"], [208, "MARIAM 200 CHAP. tioned her as to Avhether she a. ould like a continu ance, for a fortnight or so, of the present condition of things, her manner of ansAvering sufficiently expressed her disgust of the circumstances to Avhich she had been umvittingly led to commit herself. Rather, she declared, Avould she traverse the desert fifty times the distance from the Euphrates to Mecca than venture again on the bosom of the deep. \" What ! and risk being robbed by strange Be douins ?\" \" Bedouins ? And Avhat's the matter with the Bedouins ? \" she returned. \" They are decent people, I tell you. By Allah, they may rob you \u2014 but they don't make you sick ! \" To Avhich remark those of the members of the hareem who Avere able to express themselves at all added in chorus : \"Allah gives and Allah takes ! \" When Lanxon had recovered from the amazement Avhich the revelation of this state of mind naturally gave rise to, it occurred to him that the actions of a person Avho entertained such extraordinary senti ments could not very Avell be foretold, or even guessed at, Avith any more certain light than that of conjecture. Haunted Avith this idea, which seemed to stand in important relation to the possibilities Avhich at present engaged his anxious thoughts, he took the earliest opportunity of speaking to Ismar concerning Ayesha, and asking him Avhat he thought would be her conduct with regard to Djellal-el-Deen if the latter chose to reveal himself ; for, as yet, his presence on board the ship was a secret to all but Mariam, Wasseefy, Ismar, and Lanxon."], [209, "XVI MARIAM 201 Ismar did not ansAver readily ; he considered for some moments. \"Without doubt,\" he said, \"he is her cousin. \" Yes. And that has made me wonder concern ing another thing. Hoav came it that Djellal-el- Deen was aware of Mariam's setting out on the pilgrimage ? You say that the resolution Avas only come to in haste and within a day or two of the actual sailing of the Lornadale. Yet Djellal-el- Deen knew of it.\" \"What then? \" Can Ayesha have been a friend to Djellal-el- Deen all along? \" \" Nay, nay ; by Allah, that is impossible,\" re turned Ismar. \" You do not knoAv Ayesha ; her devotion to the Emir and his interests is unques tionable. You have not heard the story of the coming together of Ayesha and Nasr . . . hoAv by a most daring and ingenious artifice she succeeded in releasing him from a position of considerable danger and discomfort? Yet it forms the theme of many a song a romance. Nay, dismiss all thought of treachery on the part of Ayesha from your mind ; so long as things remain as they are, Ayesha will not move one jot to further the plans of Djellal-el- Deen, for whom, indeed, she entertains no liking.\" \" So long as things remain as they are ? \" \" Yes ; that is, so long as I have life and strength to maintain my present position. It is not so much to be Avondered at that Djellal-el-Deen should have become aAvare of the project. No doubt he has his spies, and, knoAving that his proposals would not be received Avith favour, thought it advisable to be in"], [210, "MARIAM CHAP. 202 readiness for some such evasion. He heard the news ; he had no time to arrange any elaborate plan, or even make preparations ; he rode simply to throw himself on board the ship, alone and unknoAvn \u2014 and trusted to his Kismet for the rest. To you such conduct might appear utterly incomprehensible ; to me it is not so. He counted, no doubt, on our de tention at the bar of the river, and by a lucky chance managed to get on board in the captain's boat, Avithout bringing his OAvn boatmen to the ship, so that there existed no possibility of anyone's com municating Avith the shore, even if his identity had been immediately suspected. This, it seems to me, is what everything points to as the true explanation.\" \" Yet, friend Ismar, your confidence is condi tional ... so long as things remain as they are? \" \" Allah forbid that I should assert that Ayesha Avould change if circumstances altered ! \" said Ismar, gravely ; \" yet there is that possibility. Noav, friend, let our minds be one. . . . Allah is merciful . . . Avith the blessing of Allah all things will come right, if Ave act straightforAvardly.

Wait a moment, and listen to me to the end. After much thought on the matter, it appears to me that Djellal-el-Deen must have based a great part of his hopes on his relationship to the Emir's wife. He has not revealed, and he will not reveal himself so long as I am in the way ; for I could easily prevent his access to the ladies ; nor can he even be lieve that Ayesha Avould do anything to displease the Emir, except under pressure of circumstances. But I conceive he expects that she may be induced to favour his desires as a matter of necessity. Sup pose, for an instant, that I am removed ; our party is without a leader : Djellal-el-Deen, an Arab of high degree and a kinsman of the lady Ayesha, appears. It Avould seem natural for him to take charge and fill my place. In this Ayesha might support him, ex cusing the act by the circumstances of the case, the distance from home, isolation amongst strangers, the possibility of Avorse occurring through an obstinate rejection of his friendship ; and Djellal-el-Deen is sufficiently able to assume a demeanour to lull the suspicions of even those most inclined to be appre hensive of him. Im-Abdallah and Mariam would at first, without doubt, remain stanch . . . but what can they do ? They may appeal to you, supposing that this happened whilst we were yet in your company: they might appeal to the men ; but the latter would be chiefly guided by the wishes of the Emir's Avise, and in a position of isolation amongst strangers, would be inclined to regard Djellal-el-Deen with feelings of toleration. Circumstances influence all men, and it"], [212, "MARIAM CHAP. 204 is not to be forgotten that Ayesha does not regard the matter from the same standpoint as Mariam and her mother. Besides, that which Avould not be acquiesced in willingly is often accepted as a matter of necessity. Consider the length of time involved in the pilgrimage, during Avhich Djellal el-Deen could easily manage to augment the party with friends of his own ; the peculiarity of their situ ation, Avhich Avould render it easy for Djellal-el-Deen to separate them from everything that might hinder his projects; the possibility of his inducing Ayesha to agree to the overland route home, the dangers and opportunities of which Avould favour him in the highest degree. If once, my friend, Djellal-el-Deen became leader of the party, there Avould only re main for Mariam either self-destruction or a compli ance Avith his Avishes.\" \" Not a very hopeful prospect,\" said Lanxon. \" Allah Kerim ! Allah is merciful,\" returned Ismar. \" Mind, I have tried to represent the matter as I conceive Djellal-el-Deen sees it; for one necessarily is inclined to believe that which one Avishes for. It may, on the other hand, not happen so. Ayesha may remain stanchly set against Djellal-el-Deen, either from her OAvn inclination or by persuasion of the lady Mariam and her mother ; my Arabs, again, may absolutely refuse to have anything to do Avith Djellal-el-Deen, and may obey Im-Abdallah rather than Ayesha. Such, then, are the possibilities that I have pointed out ; which, if, as I assume, they ap pear to Djellal-el-Deen in the light of probabilities, may serve to indicate to us the direction of his ma n\u0153uvres.\""], [213, "XVI MARIAM 205 MeanAvhile the object of their solicitude had passed these hours in a state of mind Avhich may easily be conceived. The revelation of the danger that threatened her had fallen like a thunderbolt ; and though the natural firmness of her disposition supported her, it is not to be wondered at if her feelings were characterized mainly by anxiety for the future. The hidden nature of the danger, and the haze Avhich necessarily, in her eyes, surrounded the character of Djellal-el-Deen, rather increased than diminished the gravity of the situation. She was conscious, Avith an instinctive certainty that was stronger than any reasoning could make it, of the purpose that Djellal-el-Deen had in view ; and the manner in Avhich she had learned to regard this man, as one not merely devoid of any moral principle, but endoAved Avith a reckless determination, in the pur suit of his object, which oft secured the attainment of it Avhen success might have been deemed impos sible, could not but inflict on her the most anxious apprehensions concerning the trials Avhich the fu ture might have in store. She exclaimed at human Avickedness, and turned her thoughts toAvards that Being the mere thought of a. hom is ever sufficient to revivify those Avho are sinking deep in the gulf of despair. The repetition of the sacred name and the frequent use of various pious ejaculations re stored to her, in great measure, a confidence Avhich had Avell-nigh left her, and caused her suddenly to remember Ismar, Avhom she had learned to regard as one of the most trustAvorthy and able of men, and Avho was now in a position to afford her effectual protection from that Avhich she dreaded \u2014 a protec-"], [214, "206 MARIAM CHAP. tion Avhich she felt sure she Avould not have to look for in vain, even if it cost him his life. Refreshed and relieved by some moments' consideration of this pleasing oasis of security, that now offered itself to her vieAv amid the comfortless Avaste of her anx ious thoughts, her mind lapsed suddenly, and as if longing for the SAveet after all she had experienced of the bitter in imagination, into a dreamy contem plation of the young Frank whose interest in her had been expressed, to her knoAvledge, in so many a Avord and gesture that she could entertain no misgiving concerning his sentiments. And, without doubt, her mind lingered longer over this phase of the situa tion \u2014 and that Avith a tremor of the nerves and a fluttering of her young heart that agitated her out of all fears and despondings, and created around her a subtle and gentle atmosphere of more than restfulness: a happiness that seemed flavoured Avith essences be longing rather to the most ethereal strata of the empyrean than to the gross earth on Avhich she had hitherto dAvelt. It boots little to inquire into the cause of this direction of her inclination despite the presence and devotion of Ismar. Though it has be come the fashion to regard every single thing in life as if it Avere a mathematical quantity, Avith definitely assured and unchangeable properties, lending them selves to successful microscopic investigation, Ave still hold that there are some things which, under this treatment, offer no better results than Avith the old methods, and often lose thereby that indefinable mystery Avhich gives to them their principal charm and value ; making them part, in an unseen fashion, of the Avhole great mystery of life. If there is one"], [215, "MARIAM XVI 207 thing certain about Love, it is that it is the most uncertain factor of all that influence human beings. Remember, reader, that Mariam was young and im pressionable ; that in countries where what Ave understand by love is saddled with most difficulties, it does oft, when it has the chance, assert itself Avith a force, a suddenness, an unexpectedness that is never seen in countries Avhere it is as easy and ordi nary a matter to make love as to eat bread-and butter ; and imagine the rest, if you will, for the play of the imagination is soft and tender and will not hurt it, but seek not for it amidst the rough boulders that are here fashioned into some manner of writing. This mood had in it a balm that lulled her senses into a silent ecstasy, as if she Avere wrapt up in one of those scented breezes that blow from the central highlands of Arabia, of which the perfume-laden air, a mingling of roses and jessamine and orange, of myrtle and thyme, and other delicate distillations, fortified by the fragrance of the grape-bearing vine trees, have found so frequent a place in the songs of the poets of her nation. She clung to it ; but ever and anon it was as if the blast of a raw and cutting wind had sent a shiver through the delicate texture of her person : a spasm of horror would seize her as her mind Avas Avrenched away from the gardens of happiness, by the grey spectre of anxiety that hovered around her, to face once more the dreary Avaste of desolation that might, perchance, become her lot in the future. Ah, by contrast how fright ful seemed the latter ! What might have been bear able was now more than repulsive. The agony of"], [216, "208 MARIAM CHAP. the thought sent a hot Avave of blood surging over the distracted brain, that seemed to threaten the loftiest heights of reason, so that it Avas only by a considerable violence and a pulling of herself to gether that she hindered the clamorous outburst of despair in AA7hich her feelings Avere naturally in clined to vent themselves. Her mother was yet in such a state of prostration that she was impelled to forbear from increasing her distress by the revela tion of her secret, lest Avorse consequences might folloAV ; for Im-Abdallah was no longer young, and in her present condition it seemed to Mariam that so terrible a shock might possibly prove fatal. And she disliked making a confidante of Ayesha, in a matter so serious, Avithout guidance from her mother. So she restrained all outAvard signs of emotion Avith an unfaltering resolution strange in one of her age and sex. From Wasseefy alone she sought sym pathy ; but Wasseefy, though faithful and devoted to her mistress, had not the mental capacity suffi cient to grasp the many intricacies and delicacies of the matter from Mariam's point of view, and could not, therefore, afford her the support that she craved. To Wasseefy, Avho hardly remembered her OAvn pa rents, the family influence that binds the Arabian was incomprehensible ; she knew in Avords alone, but not in meaning, the fact that Mariam so identified herself Avith her honoured father as not merely to assume the Avish of her father to be a barrier be tAveen herself and Djellal-el-Deen, but even herself to regard Djellal-el-Deen Avith the same feelings that had actuated him. To Wasseefy it appeared that the uttermost duty of Mariam consisted in resisting"], [217, "XVI MARIAM 209 Djellal-el-Deen as long as resistance Avas conveniently possible ; that Mariam should have any compunction about making a virtue of necessity, if it came to that, or should distress herself at all about the future, Avas a puzzle to her. She could not realize that it was to Mariam a personal matter. \" Mashallah ! \" she said, Avith a shrug of her slim shoulders, \"all men are more or less bad, and also Avomen. Bah, bah ! there is no great harm in that.\" And of her feel ings toAvards the young Frank, Mariam had said to Wasseefy not a Avord ; for a particular interest in any man Avhatever would have been the last thing she Avould have avowed to anyone, except perhaps to an indulgent mother. But the vivid powers of her imagination, by in creasing the horrible aspect of the possible future, brought her relief in a conviction that a misery of such a degree could not be the fate decreed for her by Heaven. Allah is great, Allah is merciful ; she had done nothing to deserve such punishment. The direction of her instinct Avas but in accordance with that most sacred duty of filial obedience and reve rence. Soothed once more by these devout reflec tions, she contained herself with marvellous success, so that the imvard tumult that distracted her pro duced no more outward change than an added soft ness of demeanour and a greater solicitude for the sufferings of those around her, manifested both by Avord and action. She no longer ventured abroad beyond the precincts of the alley into which the en gineers' mess-room opened and Avhich was now jea lously guarded by a sufficient number of her own party.

It Avas so vague that he was uncertain Avhether the impression that per sisted in forcing itself on his mind was of the nature of an hallucination rather than the representation of a solid fact in the Avorld outside himself. It seemed to him as if something unusual Avere astir amongst the pilgrims. He seemed to see glances that struck him as peculiar ; he seemed to hear words and snatches of conversation that struck him as more peculiar still. But he was sure of nothing; for on close examination the glances appeared to fade away into the solemn gaze of abstraction, and the utter ances that had affected him ceased, or changed in import. Conscious that his senses were morbidly excited since his conversations Avith Ismar had im pressed on him the idea that an explosion of violence might be expected at any moment, he Avas inclined at first to refer these external phenomena to the wanderings of his own imagination. But one thing was too certain to be passed over. Lanxon had in sinuated himself into the good graces of even the most fanatic of these very fanatic people by a frank ness of demeanour and an evident consideration for"], [220, "212 MARIAM CHAP. their feelings and their sufferings which came natu ral to him and almost induced them to regard him as one of themselves; and he had never approached a group even of the Persians Avithout being hailed Avith a boisterous Avelcome from each and every member of the company ; indeed these frequently repeated invitations to sit doAvn and smoke, or par take of anything they might be eating, had accumu lated into an intolerable nuisance, Avhich it required all Lanxon's poAvers of diplomacy to evade Avithout giving offence. Even Avhen prostrated by sea-sick ness, his approach had never failed to elicit from them some subdued attempt at welcome and the expression of friendship. But to-day there seemed to reign instead a decided sullenness of disposition. Nor could he any longer doubt the evidence of his senses Avhen, on entering Rakmah's tent, he Avas re ceived by Leila with doAvncast looks and in perfect silence, Avhilst her husband, Abu-Brahim, answered his remarks with the shortest of syllables and the grumpiest of tones. With these people Lanxon had hitherto stood on the most intimate terms, so that their present behaviour struck him with peculiar force. Finally Abu-Brahim let some light on the matter. \" What is the matter Avith the Avater, Hakim ? By the beard of the Prophet, it is not pure Avater ! \" \" The water ! \" repeated Lanxon in amazement. \" Ha ! let him taste some of it,\" said Leila, im petuously, handing over a glassful. \" Barikallah ! Avell done ! \" exclaimed Abu-Brahim. \" So Avill you be able to say Avhether it is fit for us to drink.\""], [221, "MARIAM XVII 213 Lanxon took a gulp of the liquid, but hastily spat it out again. It Avas distilled water, but so strongly flavoured with castor-oil that it would have turned him sick on the instant had he swallowed it. As it was, he Avas unable to restrain his features from undergoing a series of contortions that sufficiently bore Avitness to its nauseous properties. \" By Allah ! \" he exclaimed, \" this is wonderful . . . I knew nothing of it Why have you remained silent about it ? \" \" Bismillah ! \" ejaculated Abu-Brahim, \"we Avere not silent about it. We have spoken about it to the chief engineer, who prepares the Avater, and he says ' it is good enough for Hajjis ' ! \" Lanxon said not another Avord, but hurried aAvay in search of the chief engineer, alarmed beyond measure at the state of affairs. He had no difficulty now in explaining the demeanour of the pilgrims ; and the silent sullenness they exhibited appeared to him more ominous than any loud outcry, for it appeared to suggest a hidden purpose which Avas aAvaiting a proper time for its expression, gathering might in the meanwhile. Mr. Snaithe, the chief engineer, answered his ques tions passively ; could not see why any fuss should be made about the matter. There were two water tanks on board the ship, one aft and the other for'ards. The after-tank had been reserved for the crew and the saloon passengers, including their whole party ; the fore-tank had been emptied by the enormous demand made on it by the great body of pilgrims in the hot days before the Lornadale passed Ras-el- Hadd. Two days ago they had been compelled to"], [222, "MARIAM CHAP. 214 condense Avater for them. Unfortunately, the con densing apparatus, Avhich had never been used be fore, Avas found not to have been properly cared for, and the tubes were foul and choked up Avith various matters, and greasy Avith the castor-oil used in the engine-room. Whose fault Avas it ? He could not say, but thought it rested Avith the fitters in London. Of course, under these circumstances, the water Avas bound to have a nauseating taste for the first few days ; but this Avould soon pass off \u2014 before they once more came into hot Aveather \u2014 and he could not for the life of him see Avhy they should object to it ; it Avas good enough for them, and they had used it for a day or tAvo without any complaint. \" That Avas because they were so sick that they cared little Avhat they were using,\" said Lanxon. Snaithe shrugged his shoulders and said they Avould have to put up with it for a day or tAvo longer. Lanxon tried to impress upon him the seriousness of the situation, but Snaithe refused to see it ; though in general a humane and considerate man, in this in stance he proved utterly apathetic. \" My dear felloAv,\" he said, \" their talk is only chatter. It is not as if they Avere civilized beings . . . they are savages \u2014 don't knoAv the difference betAvixt clean and dirty water. It will be all right, take my Avord for it.\" Lanxon had reason to think otherAvise ; and even supposing that the state of the water was the fault of no one at present on board the ship \u2014 supposing that, so far as the responsibility of the latter Avas concerned, it was a matter of chance \u2014 he could not deny that there Avas that in Mr. Snaithe's manner of"], [223, "MARIAM XVII 215 treating the circumstance calculated rather to aggra vate than to soothe the feelings of the pilgrims \u2014 to shut them up Avithin themselves, where, pent up, they Avould naturally fester Avith poisonous virulence. Lanxon felt powerless to express himself, or even to regard the matter with such equanimity of mind as would enable him to formulate a prudent course of action. Coincidences are things which it is pos sible to consider in theory Avithout mental distur bance ; Avhen they do occur actually, however, they invariably astonish ; but Avhen they occur in close juxtaposition to such important and terrible issues as were in the present case involved, they seldom fail to stagger the most equally balanced minds, and often induce a belief in the supernatural which at other times is absent from them. And Lanxon's nature was without question impulsive, imaginative, and sensitive ; he could not by any means, in the present at least, hope to be ranked in the highest circles of intellectual eminence ; and the stagger of his faculties was proportionately great. Quitting Snaithe, Lanxon went in search of Ismar and related to him what he had discovered. Ismar at first exhibited astonishment, for he had, strange to say, heard nothing of it ; then he became furious. \" Allah ! Allah ! What is all this ? As if the natural dangers of our situation were not sufficient, must you go and place in Djellal-el-Deen's hands the weapon he needs ? \" Lanxon exclaimed against this view of the matter. \" But is it not evident ? \" cried Ismar. \" Bismil lah errahim errahman ! Djellal-el-Deen is even now laughing at our beards. If he Avere helped by the"], [224, "216 MARIAM CHAP Evil One himself, things could not have turned out more opportunely for him. And all because of your bad faith.\" \"Hoav?\" exclaimed Lanxon. \" Did you not engage to carry these pilgrims to Djeddah, and to furnish them by the Avay Avith cer tain things, amongst Avhich the most important is Avater? They require little, but what they have must be good.\" \"But it could not be avoided.\" \" Does that make any difference ?

In deed it is Avonderful. Estaferallah ! Indeed it is beyond conception. You, from Avhom Ave had a right to expect protection, have given rise to the greatest danger for us.

I shall go to the captain and acquaint him Avith the state of things, and no doubt he will at once order the Avater of the after-tank to be served out to the pilgrims.\" \" And hoAv much water is there in the after-tank ? \" \" Not much, I am afraid ; not enough to suffice for the Avhole ship even till the morning. Still it may allay the conjectures in the minds of the pil grims.\" With these Avords Lanxon hastily turned aAvay,"], [225, "MARIAM XVII 217 but he had only taken a few steps when he was accosted by Rakmah, the wife of Jusuf Effendi. \" May your shadow never be less, Hakim ! \" she said. \" I Avant speech with you.\" Rakmah and her husband were the only ones amongst the great body of pilgrims in whose de meanour Lanxon had found no change. They belonged to those who are so constituted that they experience the greatest difficulty in finding fault Avith one to Avhom they have become attached ; and amidst the storm of muttered curses on Christians, and Feringhees generally, with Avhich the atmosphere around the pilgrims now freely vibrated, they con tented themselves Avith those exclamations indicative of an unutterable belief in the regulation of all things by Allah which seldom fails to support a Mohame dan in affliction and often endows him Avith the patience of a stoic ; only at intervals relieving them selves Avith an anathema on the head of the chief engineer. Rakmah now appeared to desire private converse with him, so Lanxon walked on to the quarter-deck. \"Things are not Avell amongst the Hajjis,\" she said, shaking her head. \" I knoAv \u2014 the Avater.

There are whisperings, and suggestions, and exhortations going about from one to the other ; it is not merely the water \u2014 there is some one trying"], [226, "218 MARIAM CHAP. to excite strife betwixt the pilgrims and yourselves. Aye, and by the life of the Prophet, they say things against Ismar-Ben -Ali, and even against the great Khanums, the ladies of the Emir ! \" \" Who is this some one?\" \" It appears to me to be Sheikh Salim ; but he works in the dark, quietly and Avith great circum spection.

She bore on her countenance that stamp of good faith and honesty Avhich, by the grace of God, is not restricted to any one section of hu manity, and is to be discovered \u2014 oftener than the orthodoxy of one's constitution Avould incline one to believe \u2014 amongst all the various families of His creatures, irrespective of creed, nationality, and civi lization. She Avas evidently Avorthy of trust ; and, urged by the desirability of securing a friend of her activity and influence amidst the pilgrims, Lanxon, after enjoining on her the utmost secrecy, reA7ealed to her all that he himself kneAV concerning Djellal-el- Deen. Great Avas her astonishment, many were the exclamations that came from her, as his words threAV light on the obscure snatches of phrases and ravings that she had listened to in the first hour or tAvo of Djellal-el-Deen's delirium ; and fearful Avere the im precations that finally poured from her tongue on the head of the miscreant. She declared she Avould go and speak to the pilgrims, and, Avithout revealing anything of that Avhich Lanxon had confided to her, Avould yet, by earnest exhortation and veiled insinu ation, turn their thoughts from their present bent, and direct them instead against that vile creature Djellal-el-Deen, Avho Avas evidently more impregnated"], [227, "MARIAM XVII 219 Avith the cunning of Shaitan than the gentleness of Allah. Proceeding in this manner, full of a turbu lence of Avords and gesture that put to shame the vehemence of the monsoon wind, the impulsive dame was about to turn away and proceed to the fulfilment of her promises, when a sudden thought seized her that caused both her step and her manner to halt lamentably, so that she turned to Lanxon once more, bereft of all the enthusiasm Avhich had but this moment inspired her, and caused him almost to smile at the humour of the transfiguration she had undergone. \" But, Hakim,\" she faltered \u2014 \" you Avho are filled with the gentleness of Allah, whose look is softer than the glance of the gazelle, whose Avisdom rivals in sublimity the heavens \u2014 the Avater remains.

Passing Ismar, the latter questioned him concerning his intervieAV Avith Rakmah ; and Lanxon, mindful of the agree ment betAvixt them, related to him the Avhole con versation. Lanxon Avas rather inclined to be jubi lant ; Ismar, on the other hand, shoAved signs of increasing perplexity and trouble. \" You told her to make it knoAvn that in less than two days' time the evil in the Avater Avould be reme died?\" \"Yes.\" \" Mashallah !

Is it not true that you are giving filth to these pilgrims, av ho have the right to expect from you pure water? Is not water to these pilgrims a matter of life and death ?

They will see that if they suffer, Ave suffer likeAvise : that must make them less suscep tible to Djellal-el-Deen's influence.\" \" How long,\" exclaimed Ismar, \" will the Avater in the after-tank last ?

And is Djellal-el- Deen so void of intelligence that he will forget to remind them of this ? Nay, believe me : though it is absolutely necessary as a matter of justice that you should offer them the after-tank Avater, and also a proceeding of Avisdom Avith regard to possible future judgments on the present situation, it will hardly Aveaken Djellal-el-Deen's influence, except perhaps amongst such of the tOAvnsmen of Bagdad and Bussorah as, being friends to you, will listen to the Avords of the wife of Jusuf Effendi. With the Persians she will do nothing ; she is a Sunnite, and they are Sheites ; and the fanaticism of their feel ings, aroused by the masked man\u0153uvres of Djellal-el- Deen and fanned by the irritation dependent on the actual situation, has delivered them altogether into his hands. Were it not for him, I might control them, for it is evident that there is nothing for them to gain by violence ; but Avith his influence urging them in a direction Avhich is commended by their instincts, mine is as naught. There is left to us to commend ourselves to the protection of Allah, and aAvait Avith patience the determination of affairs.\" \" You Avould almost persuade me, likeAvise, to throAV things up and despair.\" \" Despair ! \" exclaimed Ismar. \" Estaferallah ! may Allah forbid !

Verily I say unto you, he cannot prosper, except, apparently, for a time ; weakness, if allied to a fair amount of prudence and firmness, becomes strength Avhen pitted against him. Your modern philosophers of the West, Avho appear to me in great measure pagans, Avould express the same thing by saying that he Avho pursues evil threatens the inte rests of the community in general, Avhose instinctive resistance must eventually crush him.

There I will presently join you, and Ave will talk over matters, and, inshallah ! thAvart the projects of that evil-minded son of a dog.\""], [233, "CHAPTER XVIII Captain Polwarth was a man peculiarly adapted to meet the emergency. Although not possessed of any deep and intimate knowledge of the people with whom he had to deal, he was furnished with a rough acquaintance Avith their characteristics, derived from a five years' experience in the pilgrim trade ; but, what Avas of more importance, it had chanced to him on a previous occasion to take part in an adventure similar to that Avhich noAv appeared to be impending. He Avas then only chief mate, and through the mismanagement of his senior officer, who Avoke up too late to a perception of the fact that pilgrims Avere not necessarily sheep, had Avell-nigh lost a life which had hitherto afforded him considerable enjoyment. He Avas therefore not likely, in the pres ent instance, to make light of the temper of the pil grims ; and being, likeAvise, profoundly impressed Avith the conviction \u2014 commoner indeed than one Avould willingly confess \u2014 that, Avhatever might be the rights claimed by men on earth, it Avas only such as happened to belong to the Anglo-Saxon race whose claims were to be taken 'au serieux,' there Avas little fear that he Avould alloAV his grasp of the whole business to be interfered Avith by nice calculations and considera- Q"], [234, "226 MARIAM CHAP. tions concerning what Avas due to each and every one. Such conscientious encumbrances Avere here utterly out of place ; they might have added seri ously to the perils of the situation. So great is the veil of misunderstanding betAvixt East and West that oftentimes in their relations the conduct which is characterized by a strict conscientiousness ends disastrously where unscrupulous and high-handed methods attain a startling success. The present was one of these cases ; and, fortunately for the public Aveal, the captain betrayed not the slightest desire to dive deeply into the motives of each actor in the drama that Avas noAV revealed to him by Lanxon Avith some hesitation and an occasional stammer, or to adjudge their several merits on moral grounds. He seized upon the cardinal points and stuck to them. So far as he was concerned, Djellal-el-Deen might or might not be in the Avrong ; it was equally agreeable to him to regard that enterprising indi vidual as a malefactor or an unfortunate hero of romance; but Avhat fixed his attention at once Avas the fact that Djellal-el-Deen Avas stirring up a revo lution in his ship. Djellal-el-Deen's object might have been the attainment of Heaven itself \u2014 or some similar prize Avhose pursuit is usually regarded as most meritorious and Avorthy of the help of all right minded men ; but as, amidst the haze of smoke with Avhich he filled his deck-cabin Avhilst he listened to Lanxon's account, it became clear to him that on Djellal-el-Deen's shoulders Avas propped the thicken ing storm-cloud, it became equally clear that, at the first sign of an uprising, it was necessary to bring that prop Avith an instant shock to the ground."], [235, "XVIII MARIAM 227 Such being the rock-like front which he presented to the interrupted Avaves of narrative with Avhich Lanxon assailed him, the latter might have spared himself much of the discomfort which, both from a desire not to take the veil off the things that con cerned Mariam more than Avas necessary, and from various incoherent and inexplicable currents of feel ing, naturally attended his endeavours to impress on his chief the several pros and cons of the situation. To Polwarth, Mariam Avas but a cipher ; he had never seen her ; he was only dimly aAvare that he had on board so interesting a personage ; the peculiarities of her disposition and the customs of her forefathers were of no interest to him. \" I shall shoot that man ! \" he said abruptly. He rose and rang his bell ; and to the steward, who came hurrying up at his noisy clang, he issued orders for the instant serving out of Avhat water there was in the after-tank to the pilgrims. \" I shall shoot that man,\" he repeated to Ismar and to Lanxon, in whom this announcement had created a mingling of stupefaction and admiration, \" at the first signs of a toav. Persians are very windy chaps ; they are capable of any amount of bluster, and are fierce and brave enough in that way ; but they have no bottom \u2014 they collapse speedily. If this Sheikh Salim or Djellal-el-Deen has only Persians behind him, his fall will bring them low and make them amenable to argument. What say you, friend Ismar ? \" \" Your words are full of wisdom. By the Prophet, the Persian blows one word into a hundred, and one deed into the magnitude of a thousand ! \""], [236, "228 MARIAM CHAP. \" And it will be for you, Ismar, to bring them to their senses, once Djellal-el-Deen is out of the way.\" \" By Allah ! But premature violence Avould in flame the Avhole ship ; Bussoris and Bagdadis Avould rise, as well as Persians ; and that Avith a solid griev ance behind them Avhich Avould make things ten times Avorse than they are.\" \" Fear not,\" cried Pohvarth ; \" I have no intention of creeping for'ards and shooting the creature on the sly. No : let him but make his spring. At present we are but conjecturing. I myself know nothing except that a toav is imminent ; if I find that this Djellal-el-Deen is, Avithout doubt, the instigator of the disturbance, I shall shoot him at once \u2014 that is all . . . in self-defence. That Avater business is un fortunate, but it can't be helped. I care not a farthing for Djellal-el-Deen's motives ; to see him actively leading on the insurgents will be sufficient for me. No blame can attach to me for doing what seems to me best for securing the safety of the ship.\" The uncompromising and iron-like resolution of the captain forthAvith inspired the conclave, so that Avithout Avaste of time a clear and definite compre hension of the situation Avas arrived at, and means devised to meet every possible outcome of it. It was judged necessary to carry out all preparations under the greatest secrecy, lest an alarm should be created that Avould inflame into fierce combustion Avhat, after all, might yet only be a smouldering sense of resentment \u2014 perfectly just under the cir cumstances. For this reason Lanxon's suggestion that the ladies of the Emir should be removed to"], [237, "MARIAM XVIII 229 the saloon in the hind-part of the vessel Avas nega tived ; for, apart from the resistance such a proceed ing Avould encounter from the ladies themselves, Avho Avere ignorant and Avhom it was judged advisable to keep in ignorance of the cause for it, it Avould naturally create a tumult of questionings and sus picions amongst the excited pilgrims. On other grounds also it Avas deemed more prudent to leave them Avhere they Avere. It was absolutely necessary to prevent the machinery of the ship from falling into the hands of the insurgents, and the party to whom Ismar entrusted the guardianship of the ladies Avould, by reason of the narroAvness of the two alleys that ran along each side of the engine-house, be quite sufficient, together Avith the engineer and such of the firemen as Avere on duty in the stoke-hole, to keep possession of this part of the ship ; whilst the effectual blocking of these alleys Avould also serve to cut off communications betAvixt the fore part of the main-deck, Avhereon Avere massed the majority of Persians and that nondescript and Avild looking contingent Avhich had embarked Avith them, and the after-half, Avhich Avas principally occupied by the Bussoris, Bagdadis, and Arabians. This Avas the numbering of souls on board the Lornadale : There Avere betAveen sixty and seventy Avomen and half as many children, Avho, except for their poAvers of increasing the hubbub, Avere of no consequence in the present state of affairs ; there Avere nearly one hundred and fifty toAvnsmen from the various cities on the Euphrates and Tigris, prin cipally from Bussorah and Bagdad : of these eighty were Sunnites and therefore in scant sympathy with"], [238, "MARIAM CHAP. 230 the Sheites ; whilst concerning the rest, though be longing to she latter sect, there Avas reason to hope that they Avould hold aloof from any active demon stration of 111- .vill, if not incited thereto by mis management and aggravation. Then there were someAvhat over three hundred Persians and some what under fifty of various and remote derivations \u2014 an inflammable croAvd by reason of their ingrained fanaticism and the utter ignorance of Franks and Christians in which they had hitherto lived. These were the people from Avhom danger Avas to be appre hended ; and though perhaps a hundred of them might reasonably be expected to lie quiet in conse quence both of the deterrent influence that sea sickness exerts on an exaltation of thought and action, and of the moral restraint Avhich the conduct of the Bagdadis and Bussoris Avould produce on such of them as lived amongst the latter on the after half of the main-deck, yet the remnant Avere suffi ciently numerous to afford much ground for anxiety, especially in vieAV of the possibility of some mis chance suddenly giving rise to a general instead of only a partial conflagration. For the escort of the ladies of the Emir under Ismar amounted to only tAventy-tAvo Bedouins and eight black slaves ; of these the slaves and ten Bedouins were stationed beloAv in the alleys about the engine-rooms ; the re mainder it Avas noAv determined to draAv away quiet ly from their present quarters and secrete beloAv in the saloon. The ship's company consisted of the captain, the doctor, three engineers, three mates, the steAvard, the cook, the carpenter, the bosun and six seamen, the donkeyman and eight foremen, and the"], [239, "MARIAM XVIII 231 cabin-boy \u2014 in all tAventy-eight : a small company for so large a ship and so arduous a climate for English men ; the third engineer and four of the men being at the present moment incapacitated by illness, and confined to their quarters ; but ship-owners, in these days of keen competition and small profits, are more than ordinarily tenacious of their dividends. The sick men in the foc'sle were to be removed in the gloom that Avas now rapidly closing around them, by way of the upper deck, to the cabin referred to above as the hospital in front of the engine-room, within the alley-doors, so as to be under the pro tection of the guard there stationed. The foc'sle, indeed, was to be entirely abandoned during this critical period ; four seamen and tAvo firemen were to take up their quarters in the saloon for the night, and keep as much aft during the next day as was compatible with their duties ; the chief and second engineers, the donkeyman, and the remaining capa ble firemen to confine themselves to the cabins in the alleys ; the carpenter, chief and third mates, and boy to station themselves on the bridge ; the bosun and one seamen to secure themselves in the wheel house underneath the bridge ; Avhilst the chart-room behind the Avheel-house was to be 'securely bolted. The available firearms were eight revolvers for the officers \u2014 the one belonging to the third engineer being now handed over to the bosun \u2014 and seven rifles and bayonets with Avhich the steward and the six men brought doAvn to the saloon could be armed. By these provisions it was hoped that the direction and locomotion of the ship might remain secure, whilst the captain would have a sufficient contingent with him aft to control the upper deck with."], [240, "MARIAM 232 CHAP. The determination of these things did not take long, for the urgency of the moment Avas upon them, and quickened their thought and nerved their wills to action. Then Lanxon, leaving the captain to deliver his orders and Ismar to bring his men to the saloon without exciting comment, hurried beloAv doAvn the after-hatch, and paid a visit to Rakmah's tent. Here he Avas received Avith greater warmth than in the earlier part of the day ; the pure Avater from the after-tank had Avorked on the Avorthy carpenter of Bagdad and his lovely wife a change, so that they smiled on him and seemed ashamed of their rude ness to him in the afternoon. Sensible that this mood of theirs gave him an advantage, Lanxon at once and with boldness upbraided them Avith the want of confidence they had exhibited to him Avho had hitherto been called their friend, and had par taken of food Avith them, and engaged himself as one of their domestic circle ; and Rakmah, coming in at the moment, seconded him ably, in her customary outspoken manner, and gave utterance to some sharp sentiments concerning those Avho preferred the counsel of burnt dogs of strangers to that of tried friends, Avhich made even the mother of Leila rouse herself from the stupor in Avhich she had lain during the last feAv days, and exclaim : \" Allah ! Allah ! What is this ? Moderate your Avords, O Avoman, in face of all this people, else I Avill presently begin to talk to you myself ! \" Avhilst Jusuf Effendi \u2014 Avho Avas of a placid disposition, in remarkable contrast to his Avise, and had in obedience to her meekly bided outside the tent since the intrusion therein of Leila and her mother \u2014 iioav edged his"], [241, "MARIAM XVIII 233 face therein for the purpose of enunciating in a philo sophic manner some general propositions concerning the value and beauty of confidence betwixt friends\u2014 Avhich, coming from a Turk, must have been pecu liarly galling to the sensitive Abu-Brahim. \" And so indeed,\" exclaimed Lanxon, proceeding to strike whilst the iron was hot and clench his pur pose in the midst of a double stream of deprecatory ejaculations from Leila and her husband, \" you will again say, when the sweet Avater comes to an end, that Ave are false and design evil against you ? By Allah, such is not the manner of friendship, O Abu- Brahim ! \" \" Nay, Estaferallah ! may Allah forbid ! We will drink the Avater. Ha! Avhat manner of talking is this \u2014 such noise, such lamentation ? We Avill drink the Avater, even though it comes from the depths of Gehennam. Allah is great. We will drink Avithout complaint. But say not so that the sweet Avater Avill come to an end. Shall it be ? Estaferallah ! \" \" Of course it will be, Abu-Brahim ! \" cried Lanxon. \" Hoav can it be otherwise, Avhen the Avater of the tank in the hind-part of the vessel is so little ? Even now it is at an end, and when you have each finished your present allowance you will for another day have the ill-tasting Avater. It is the fault of those careless and Avretched people in London \" (\" May their fathers be burnt ! \" put in Leila), \" and Ave must all suffer equally. But behold : if you Avish it, we Avill give to you of those other drinks Avhich we make use of.\" \" Nay, nay,\" cried Abu-Brahim, \"that would be a sin, and we should forfeit thereby the blessings of"], [242, "MARIAM 234 CHAP. XVIII this holy pilgrimage. Nay, Estaferallah! it shall not be! Is not Allah the Director of all things? Shall avc be dogs ? Shall we endanger our souls to give ease to our bodies ? Nay, we will drink of the ill-tasting Avater \u2014 Ave will drink, I say, all day long, and be sick if necessary. What is all this talk about ? There is no great harm in that. O Mo hamed ! O Prophet of Allah ! \" But Lanxon ceased not to harass the carpenter until he had draAvn forth such protestations as to convince him that he could count on, at least, the neutrality of the tOAvnsmen in the expected distur bance. For Abu-Brahim, by reason of his being, besides a doughty man of war, a poet and a reciter of narratives, and in general a master of language, Avas held in much esteem by his felloAv-citizens, and those from other toAvns who had come in contact Avith him ; so that they would in all probability be SAvayed byhis example. And his assurance afforded Lanxon great comfort ; for though these tOAvnsmen Avere only, comparatively speaking, in slight degree fanatical, and, from their having come into frequent contact Avith Franks, not particularly ill-disposed toAvards them, yet they doubtless possessed in the hidden depths of their natures much of that grim determination Avhich has made the Arabian, even in these latter days of Tokar and Abu Klea, so terrible an antagonist Avhen fully aroused \u2014 Avhom neither the arms nor the splendid discipline of Roman or British legions could daunt Avhilst life remained, \u2014 and Avould have darkened the prospect indeed had they shoAvn a decided inclination to side Avith Djellal-el- Deen."], [243, "CHAPTER XIX The Lornadale moved restlessly ownwards, now halting high in a silent tremble at the swirl of the heaved-up Avaters, now dropping again with a groan of her timber and a rumble of her screw, and the swish of the cleft wave about her ; whilst above the trembling light from myriads of stars shone through the darkened ether, and around the silent mystery of night welded weirdly together the heavens and the earth. Christopher Lanxon lying on a couch, now gazing aloft, noAv gazing abeam, and then along the deck, found it impossible to secure the rest which the more phlegmatic captain was already enjoying in his cabin. Vague shadows flitted and floated about in the darkness\u2014 the shadows of sentries, wakeful and watchful at various points ; the rustling of bodies, the murmur of voices, reached him from the saloon, but in a subdued manner, that bred a sense of mys tery. The pilgrims were quiet to a degree that seemed beyond the natural ; a few reclined here and there on the upper deck, rolled up in their ample cloaks ; at long intervals only the deep stillness was broken by some loud-voiced and startling invocation to Allah, or to one of those personages who appear"], [244, "236 MARIAM CHAP. to share almost equally Avith the Supreme Ruler of the Universe the reverence of Mohamedans of cer tain sects. Ismar likeAvise seemed not inclined to sleep. With steps that gave not the slightest sound, he glided at intervals hither and thither, noting the disposition of things on the upper deck, and peering Avith bated breath doAvn the hatcliAvays. If his theory of life Avas dominated by fatalism, his practice in controlla ble matters appeared not to be affected by it. No one on board the Lornadale Avas more watchful than he that night. The sentries kept their allotted periods, and fell asleep immediately after ; the cap tain slept soundly; Lanxon tried hard to do the same\u2014 his Avakefulness sprang from a suppressed excitement which he Avas poAverless to allay entirely. Noav and again Ismar returned to the quarter-deck, and sat himself doAvn beside Lanxon ; and they spoke to each other in Avhispers, or conversed in the silence of sympathy. A vague promise of things extra ordinary seemed to hang around them ; probability reinforced by their OAvn imagining into certainty ; a presentiment Avhose mysterious and indefinable nature seemed in accordance Avith the Aveirdness of their general surroundings. Thus passed the night ; and the skies lightened and brightened under the effulgence of the rising sun, the heavens above dreAv apart from the Avaters beloAv, and the liquid expanse lost its cold and sullen aspect, and seemed even to lessen its turbulence as the soft and shimmering radiance streamed more and more over its crested Avaves. It Avas at this early hour of the morning Avhen the"], [245, "MARIAM XIX 237 growing redness of the eastern horizon announced the dawn of another day, that certain sounds came Avafted across to the quarter-deck from the fore-part of the ship, and caused Lanxon to sit up. He saw Ismar approaching him swiftly. \" The time is come ! \" said Ismar in a quick Avhisper. \"Ah! what's up?\" \" The Persians are astir \u2014 Djellal-el-Deen is talking to them.\" What is he talking about ? \" He is making a speech.\" And what is he saying ? \" \" He is inciting them to violence : I waited to hear no more. By Allah, we were not mistaken ! \u2014 it is to be as Ave thought it Avould.\" At this moment was heard the single clang of a bell on the bridge. It Avas the signal from Mr. Lumsden, the chief mate. Ere the sound of this had died aAvay, the captain tumbled out of his cabin, and greeted Lanxon and Ismar Avith a tremendous yaAvn. \" So early in the morning ? \" he said. \"Yes. Our conjectures are about to come true.\" \" So much the Avorse for that fool, Avhether he calls himself Salim or Djellal-el-Deen,\" said Pohvarth, coolly. \"Is everybody ready? \" \"Yes.\" The bell on the bridge clanged again, this time with someAvhat more vehemence. \" Bring the men up from the saloon, then, and post them behind my cabin,\" said Pohvarth. \" Where is that damned interpreter ? \" \" NoAvhere,\" said Lanxon. \" And the soAvarsalso"], [246, "238 MARIAM CHAP. have disappeared. I have seen nothing of them since yesterday.\" \" The cattle ! Frightened at the first signs of a storm.\" Noav there came noiselessly up the stairs Mr. Jupp, the steAvard, with his six men, armed Avith the rifles and bayonets. Mr. Jupp's face looked brighter than it had been for some days past. Life had become someAvhat monotonous for him ; the mixing of palatable decoctions, his only solace, was a pleas ant enough occupation, but apt to pall by reason of its sameness, to dim his faculties, to affect them as Avith an eruginous incrustation. The expected brush with a croAvd of yelling pilgrims Avas the very thing he Avanted to cheer him up ; he had no fear as to the result. Mr. Jupp Avas a big man \u2014 his fist alone, he said, Avas equal to the matter of settling a dozen Hajjis : Iioav many more, then, Avas he not a match for Avith a beautiful Winchester rifle in hand and a sharp-pointed bayonet at the end of it ! Mr. Jupp (or Mr. Yupp, as he was commonly called by the irreverent ship's company ; for, through some oversight in the furnishing of his system which he, at various times, ascribed to various causes, maternal and otherAvise, but which Avas gene rally attributed to a Dutch extraction, he was unable to pronounce the initial letter of his surname) had spent the Avhole night in expounding this point to the men noAV committed to his charge, in the intervals of consuming the stimulating beverage Avhich, despite the captain's strict orders, he had thought it only right to celebrate the occasion with. He therefore stepped out on the deck, gripping"], [247, "XIX MARIAM 239 his Aveapon hard, with the air of a man who feels that he has only to come, to be seen, and to con quer ; and suffered a severe shock Avhen he was told by the captain to get behind the deck-cabin. For a moment he appeared as if he were about to argue the point ; but there Avas a nasty look about Pol- Avarth, such as he Avore on serious occasions when, as Mr. Jupp Avell kneAV, he was apt to fly out in a most disagreeable manner at anybody Avho pre sumed to contravene his wishes ; so he restrained his emotions at this blight on his aspirations, and ensconced himself. Mr. Laidler, the second mate, now joined them ; appearing to view the critical state of affairs with the greatest equanimity. He said the weather was getting Avarmer. \" Things all right beloAv, amidships ? \" said Pol- Avarth. \" Even so ; I was there but a few minutes since, said Ismar. \" TheyAvill block the alleys at the sound of the bell.\" \" Such Avere their orders.\" \"That's a small bell,\" observed Mr. Laidler. \" They might not have heard it.\" \" Bring up the dinner-bell,\" said Pohvarth. Mr. Jupp dropped his rifle and vanished below, to reappear in a moment with the dinner-bell. This instrument he considered in a measure as a part of himself ; he Avas wont to explain that it Avas the symbol of his office. He now relieved his blighted feelings by a furious clanging of it. \" Steady, man ! \" exclaimed Polwarth, so fiercely that Jupp suddenly shivered and remained silent."], [248, "MARIAM CHAP. 240 \" What the devil ! Do you wish to throAv all these pilgrims into hysterics?\" Suddenly, as if called from the hidden depths by the sound of the steAvard's bell, there swarmed out of the fore-hatch a confused croAvd of angry figures, and the SAvell of their voices, Avhich had been tossed about by the whirl of the wind and Avafted along Avithout any substance, noAv rumbled aft as a thick hoarse roar of threatening bluster. They called for Avater, they called for vengeance ; they shoAvered maledictions Avithout discrimination on the persons and belongings of those Avho treated them as dogs, and appeared unanimous in the intention to burn the fathers of every Frank and Christian on board of the ship. They seemed not to Avalk, but rolled omvards, a'nd surged beneath the bridge, and yelled at the Franks thereon posted, Avho only ansAvered by making at them faces indicative of contempt, and kicking back Avith exceeding ease those Avho ven tured to scale the narroAV ladder or clamber up the supporting posts. Still on they SAvarmed, and at the head of them Djellal-el-Deen, Avho had espied Ismar leaning against the railing near the deck cabin, by the side of the captain, of Lanxon, and of Laidler. And at this moment it Avas impossible not to regard him with a measure of admiration : un robed amidst the croAvd that surged around him, he looked the man Avhose manhood stood the highest, beautiful in form and graceful in gesture, SAvayed by a force that flashed from his eyes and swelled his voice with a Avhirl of passion which caught the senses of those around him and made them subser vient to his will."], [249, "XIX MARIAM 241 \" Behold the cursed dogs whose destination is Gehennam ! \" he cried, in ringing tones. \" Fonvard, O blessed believers! Prostrate their religion! Burn their fathers ! Defile the graves of their mothers and grandmothers ! \" And the yelling crowd yelled the louder, and signified their unalterable resolution to proceed to these extremities. As Djellal-el-Deen drew nearer, Ismar altered his position, and as if involuntarily, as if unconscious of all around him but Djellal-el-Deen, moved toAvards the latter with an almost imperceptible motion, his hands folded across his unrobed figure, his features set in rigid sternness, his eyes flashing forth an un wavering flame that lit on Djellal-el-Deen and took note of no other things beside him. And as he moved, there streamed out from behind the deck cabin his dozen Arabs. They had learned from Ismar the true state of affairs : that the matter lay not so much betAveen Djellal-el-Deen and the Franks as betAveen Djellal-el-Deen and Ismar, Djellal-el-Deen and themselves ; and now they advanced, keeping close to their leader, in face of the turbulent sea of humanity before them, in that terrible silence Avhich falls upon brave and resolute men when they are called upon to struggle for self-preservation against overAvhelming odds ; with a gloAV of grim determina tion on their faces, and the same intentness of gaze on one figure amongst those opposed to them \u2014 the conspicuous figure of Djellal-el-Deen.

And such Avas the attitude of these tAvo men that the character of the scene changed wholly, making it appear as if they Avere the central and all-important factors in it, and all the rest mere accessories. \" Ha ! and this \u2014 by the beard of the Prophet ! Avhat is this?\" cried Djellal-el-Deen, Avith a fury that exceeded all bounds. \" This \u2014 O blessed believers, give me your ears and fasten your eyes on what my finger points out to you \u2014 this is Ismar-Ben-Ali, the apostate \u2014 may his eyes be blinded and his life be blasted ! This is he Avho, sprung from the faithful, has lived amongst the filth-eating SAvine of Christian Feringhees, and comes now in league with them to the end that he may secure our destruction. This is he \u2014 by Allah the Almighty, curse him Avith your voices, and crush him with your feet \u2014 \" It came about in a manner that no man present could fathom, so suddenly that on the instant the tAvo figures became one, clenched in that deadly embrace Avhich means the pitting of one life against another, and Avas so terrible that even the loudest voiced baAvler in that motley creAV ceased his voci feration and raised himself on some convenient spot to Avatch the mortal struggle. Only from afar, Avhere the tail of the rebellious croAvd and the Franks on the bridge Avere exchanging sentiments and occa sionally bloAvs, did there yet rise an uproar. And unnoticed in the excitement of the moment, Mr. Jupp and his men stole forwards. They tAvisted and Avrithed in so intricate a fashion, amidst a Avhirl of their various draperies, as to make"], [251, "XIX MARIAM 243 it impossible for the spectators accurately to folloAv the progress of the combat ; but on a sudden there occurred a change, a stillness of the tempest, and Djellal-el-Deen lay prone, and above him Ismar Avith a knee on his chest and a hand deeply grappling his throat. An exulting roar rose from the one side, a confused spluttering of amazed ejaculations from the other; for no one unacquainted with the menAvould have judged Ismar to be a match for the splendid Djellal-el-Deen. But Ismar was an expert wrestler, trained in the gymnastic schools of the West ; nor was his spare and sinewy frame calculated to give a just idea of his poAvers to one a\\71io based his calcula tions on mere bulk of bone and muscle. In the silence that immediately ensued, the dull thud of Djellal-el-Deen's head on the hard deck boards sounded an ominous confirmation of his utter helplessness. But as if dazed by the suddenness and unexpectedness of events, none of his folloAvers offered as yet to help him. \"How noAv, O Djellal-el-Deen, Iioav noAV?\" cried Ismar. \" Is it your wish to be treated as an idiot bereft of sense, or as a man who is responsible for his action ? Speak, by Allah the Almighty ; by the Prophet of Allah, speak \u2014 and take the consequen ces ! \" Djellal-el-Deen's eyes were starting from their sockets, his face was livid ; and as Ismar emphasized his last injunction by dashing his head once more against the unyielding deck, one might have sup posed him deprived of all vitality. Yet from his lips, that could scarcely move, there came forth a hoarse Avhisper :"], [252, "MARIAM CHAP. 244 \" As a man, bismillah ! \" Ismar's face darkened, and the madness of rage suffused his eyes. He ground his teeth and tight ened his grasp, but a rush of the Persians, Avhom the whisper of Djellal-el-Deen had aAvakened, dis lodged and overthreAv him, and Djellal-el-Deen once more regained his feet and urged his folloAvers on. And now for a moment all Avas confusion, as a dozen men fought against tAvo hundred and more. But the days of Djellal-el-Deen Avere numbered, and the mystery of his life Avas about to be recalled to merge itself again in the great UnknoAvn. A few sharp words of command, a discharge of revolvers, and the Persians fell back before the line of bayonets Avith Avhich Mr. Jupp and his men offered to prod their sensitive hides ; they fell back so rapidly that no Aveapon had time to penetrate deeply, and once secure they gave vent to their feelings of disgust \u2014 searching the while through many folds and cover ings for Avhere the tingling of nerves told of injured integuments. And in the open space there lay the body of Djellal-el-Deen, with a crimson fluid Avelling up to the surface from a vital organ, and streaming and trickling over his vestments, and dropping noiseless ly onto the deck-boards. The moment Avas big with fate, and the destinies of all on board the Lornadale trembled 'in the ba lance.

But a Avord, a gesture,"], [253, "XIX MARIAM 245 might put an end to it and drive them headlong into a maddened career of destruction, void of reason and void of restraint. The thought of this came to Ismar as he stooped and gazed at his fallen enemy Avith a countenance Avhich expressed commiseration rather than anger ; and raising himself SAviftly, he sprang upon the edge of the after-hatch barrier and, maintaining himself by means of a beam overhead Avhich had served to support the awning, he pro ceeded to address the croAvd. In tones full of fire and eloquence he poured on them a flood of Avords Avhich instantly engaged their attention, for none are more susceptible than Persians to the power of language ; so that the indications of turbulence de serted their countenances, and they gazed up toAvards him entranced and quiescent. And once in this mood, they Avere at his poAver ; for he proved a very Antony in the matter of speech-making. He asked them what they purposed to do ; hoAv they expected to fare if they damaged the ship or killed the ship's officers, since none of them knew the methods of navigation or the secrets of engineering. This af fected them much, so that they wagged their heads and said one to the other : \" Bah, bah ! we never thought of that. Of course it is evident that if we killed the captain and the sailors, Ave should have to eat dirt ourselves, and never reach the tomb of the Blessed Mohamed. Surely this man's talk is the essence of Avisdom.\" Then he revealed to them that this Sheikh Salim was other than he seemed \u2014 though he refrained from telling them who he really Avas : a man of evil life, Avho bore towards him, Ismar, a deadly grudge, Avhich he had tried to satisfy at their expense,"], [254, "246 MARIAM CHAr. inciting them to violence which must needs prove disastrous to many of them and might ultimately wreck the Avhole pilgrimage, from private motives Avhich had nothing to do with the cause of their ex citement. At these Avords the ire of the long-bearded Persians rose, for it seemed that this unknoAvn felloAv had been merely using them for his OAvn purposes \u2014 a mortifying reflection. Then Ismar proceeded and dAvelt on the state of affairs, and explained hoAv the unfortunate condition of the water Avas due to no fault of any one of the ship's company, and could not be remedied by violence to the latter ; but that by the next morning the Avater Avould have surely lost its evil flavour. Were they true believers and ambi tious of attaining to the fulness of the sacred charac ter of Hajjis, and yet rebellious at this slight mishap Avhich Allah had sent to try the value of their faith ? ' Estaferallah ! ' cried one and all. Then Avith vehemence Ismar dared them to say that Avhat Djellal-el-Deen had accused him of \u2014 of being an apostate from Islam \u2014 was true. Had he ever neg lected the religious observances prescribed by their creed? Was there a single one amongst them better acquainted Avith the Koran and the Sacred Tradi tions than himself ? Was not his very presence on that ship in the character of a pilgrim proof sufficient of his devotion to Mohamed, the Prophet of Allah ? He Avas friendly with the Franks, though they Avere Christians ; but Avas there evil in that ? Were not Christians as Avell as Mohamedans created by the same Allah of heaven ? Did not the Blessed Prophet himself declare that the Prophet of the Christians Avas the best of men and the sublimest of"], [255, "XIX MARIAM 247 teachers ? and was it for them, after that declaration, to say that friendship Avith a Christian Avas necessarily a sin ? In short, long before he had finished his peroration a complete revolution had been effected in the senti ments of the pilgrims. \" He is dead,\" said they. \" Bah, bah ! there is no great harm in that. Did he not laugh at our beards \u2014 the son of a thief? Burn his father, and have done Avith him ! \" So, when Ismar's words came to an end, there arose a voice crying, \" AAvay, O blessed believers, aAvay ; each one to his business. The hour of prayer is come. There is no god but God, and His poAver is infinite, and His justice never fails ! Waste not the precious moments on a man who is less than dirt.

And in proportion as these signs of better times made themselves manifest, so did the Aveary Hadjis increase their numbers on the upper deck ; fearing at first to establish themselves permanently, lest the demon of the sea might once more disturb their calculations : and gazing Avith great reverence at the heavens above them, and the sea beloAv them, and the captain on the bridge betAvixt the tAvo, whose wisdom they felt no longer Avorthy to dispute, but still viewing with placid suspicion his oft-repeated assurances that no more Avind might be feared \u2014 for after all, though evidently a man of Avisdom and good-nature, he Avas yet a Feringhee and a Christian, whose chief delight must consist in their OAvn confusion.

Once more they rigged up their tents and spread their carpets, and squatted in company and chatted in chorus ; once more the men discussed theology, philosophy, and tea together, Avhilst the Avomen's voices might be heard high above the rest engaged in wordy disputes, which ahvays seemed as if they must end in unparliamentary proceedings, but ahvays finished up good-humouredly : or they scolded the children \u2014 of these there were about thirty on board, of various and interesting ages \u2014 or they paid each other visits.

They Avere approaching the end of their journey : they counted the days ; they counted the hours ; they quarrelled over the minutes ; and one enthusiastic mathematician dreAvup an elaborate calculation con cerning the number of seconds that must elapse ere they could set foot on the holy land of Arabia. Every morning Avhilst yet the scales of sleep Avere falling from their anxious eyes ; Avhilst yet the pale splendour of the morning's daAvn SAvam like a mist of transcendent glory on the far-distant horizon, there occurred a rush of every one of the blessed six hun dred \u2014 including the babes, Avho toddled and spraAvled and screamed and yelled in the fruitlessness of their endeavours \u2014 to the uttermost parts of the vessel."], [259, "XX MARIAM 251 There they leant over the railings, they hung from the cordage, and gazed Avith piercing eyes through the boundless infinity that spanned their mortal vision. They offered bribes to the captain for standing room on the elevated bridge ; and Avhen he represented to them the terrible dangers to the navi gation of the ship that Avould result from their pres ence on that bridge, they offered to climb up the bare masts and the derricks ; some of the more sedate declared that they Avould be satisfied if they were allowed to seat themselves on the funnel. Nor should this last conception be vieAved in the light of the ludicrous ; for there issued from its gaping mouth only a thin haze of vapour, far too unsub stantial to produce any deterrent effect on these ardent enthusiasts, Avho Avere quite Avilling to risk a tumble into the unquenchable fire beloAv for the sake of a glance into the heaven beyond. And again toAvards evening, Avhen the last rays of the declining sun lit up the high expanse above into variegated tracts of ether, each endowed for a moment Avith a purity and softness of colouring that seemed to re veal for that brief period the unutterable and unat tainable splendour of the unseen universe, there occurred the same phenomenon, the same gathering together of anxious, breathless gazers into infinity, pale with emotion, silent with apprehension lest their attention should be distracted at the auspicious mo ment, and they might lose the blessed chance of being the first to herald the sacred land. There had taken place a great change in the humour of these enthusiasts. They belonged to various sects, the members of each sect impelled by"], [260, "252 MARIAM CHAP every feeling of self respect to vieAv with disgust and hatred the members of every other sect. They folloAved in this the common instinct of humanity, strengthened in their case by the peculiar tempera ment that belonged to them. For religion Avas to them a good deal more than it is to even a religious European : it stood to them not merely in the ordi nary light of religion ; it usurped all the influences that in the bosom of the latter belong to the love of country, to patriotism. And in the increased fer vour induced by the pilgrimage in which they Avere engaged, this animosity tended to double itself. But the reaction that had come over their feelings after the fall of Djellal-el-Deen Avas fatal to this spirit of intolerance, for it brought them once more under the SAvay of a subtle but all-pervading poAver \u2014 a poAver that had begun to exert itself from the very beginning of the voyage, from the very moment that Ismar had stepped on board, but had been hindered in its progress by the intrigues of Djellal-el-Deen, supported as they Avere by the natural inclinations of this people. Noav, hoAvever, as they stood Avithin reach of their goal, the spirit that reigned amongst them Avas not simply that of tolerance, but in many instances a genial friendliness, despite the uttermost divergence of creeds \u2014 a friendliness Avhich even ex tended to the ship's company generally. To anyone who is acquainted Avith the ingrained obstinacy of Mohamedans in these matters this will appear almost incredible.

There Avas no tinge about him of that sycophancy which characterizes ' enlightened ' Easterns \u2014 a term, indeed, coined out of the complacency of Western opinion especially for those who bring to it the SAveet incense of their adulation. And Ismar seemed to Lan xon exceedingly peculiar in this, that he never SAverved from his loyalty to the spirit of his own people. \" There is much that is beautiful and admirable in your civilization,\" he said one day as the Lornadale was gliding swiftly past the island of Perim.

And this pilot \u2014 a man called Salim, who was provided with a scanty know ledge of English from having served many times as pilot on board a British man-of-war \u2014 was so certain that he knew every inch of the passage that he dis regarded the buoys laid down in the narrow strait betwixt Kamaran and the mainland, notAvithstanding the remonstrances of the captain, and speedily ran the Lornadale ashore : fast ashore, with no possibi lity of moving till the tide came up at ten o'clock at night \u2014 and perhaps not until the next morning. Great was the consternation produced amongst the pilgrims by this untoward event. They welled up from beloAv and flooded the upper deck. They ran hither and thither like frightened sheep, men, Avomen, and children inextricably mixed up together, for the great ship heeled over on to her side to a fearful"], [270, "262 MARIAM CHAP. extent, as if she Avere about to capsize, and the jaAvs of death yaAvned unpleasantly near to these inex perienced people. They Avere not coAvards in the ordinary sense of the term. But to the sea they were not accustomed ; to a Avatery grave they enter tained decided objections : and especially to aAvatery grave in the companionship of voracious sharks, who, they had season to suspect, entertained no reverence for the sacred character of a Hadji, and Avould treat their mortal remains with no greater respect than those of the veriest dog of a Christian on board. So they hoAvled and they yelled ; they screamed and they moaned ; they tore their beards and they beat their bosoms ; they called out to Allah to perform a miracle in their behoof, and to Mohamed the Prophet to come doAvn in his glory and take them to heaven straight off. Then the captain, who Avas in Avhat might be termed a white fury Avith the pilot, cried out to Ismar to urge the pilgrims onto the fore-part of the vessel, so that they might make the stem heavier and sink it in the Avater and thus disengage the stern, which Avas the part that had stuck. And at his words, Ismar \u2014 who had been gazing on the scene Avith mingled rage at the catastrophe, and humour at the vehement demonstrations of the long-bearded Persians \u2014 spoke to his Arabs, Avho had grouped themselves close to the tent on the quarter-deck, so that they aided him in his endeavours, and he rushed forward and drove the beAvildered croAvd before him, scolding them and pitying them, cursing them and comforting them all in one breath, and generally exhorting them at in tervals Avith great eloquence, saying : 'Ho, all ye"], [271, "XXI MARIAM 263 blessed and unhappy believers ! Depart from these parts and go up into the fore-part of the vessel ! Depart, I say, in the name of Allah, and Mohamed his Prophet ! Gather yourselves on the fore-part of the vessel and make yourselves heavy, and cry out to Allah that he may hear you and add to your Aveight, so that the fore-part may sink into the Avater and the stern rise out of the mud in which it is em bedded. Yallah ! depart, I say ! \" And they hearkened to his words and fled before his bloAvs, and massed themselves on the fore-part of the vessel, but it did not sink ; so that they groaned aloud, and then they gathered below and around the bridge, and they stood on the deck, and they mounted on barrels, boxes, and railings, and they climbed up the masts and sat upon the awn ings ; and from these positions of vantage they ex pressed their sentiments to the unhappy pilot in as dispassionate a language as the nature of the cir cumstances Avould permit. And the pilot, huddled up in a corner of the bridge, listened to them in great fear and trembling, for they used strong language and described to him Avith great poAver Avhat they would do to him when they got hold of him ; and the wretchedness of the prospect came over his spirit, and he spake in bitterness, and said to Lanxon : \"You gib me bun bottle whiskey, and I get dam drunk ! \" It was now past three o'clock ; and the Persian interpreter, Avho had been many times this way be fore, urged the captain to send a boat to the station with the ship's papers, so as to reach it before sun set, that the quarantine might be dated from the"], [272, "264 MARIAM CHAP. moment the Lornadale ran ashore. In this Avay they Avould save fifteen hours ; for even if they man aged to get off Avith the tide at ten o'clock and reach the station that night, the quarantine Avould still not begin to count before sunrise the next morning. The interpreter assured the captain that the station only lay beyond a certain point they could see in the distance. \"In half-hour you reach it \u2014 only one half-hour.\" The thing seemed simple enough ; and as none of the mates or engineers could be spared, Lanxon volunteered to undertake the duty, and he said he Avould take the interpreter Avith him. The latter raised objections. \" Wrhat use?\" he said. \"What use? There is the point \u2014 ha ! you not see it ? You pass the point \u2014 only one half-hour \u2014 then \u2014 ha ! \u2014 there is the sta tion.\" \" But why should you not come Avith me ? \" queried Lanxon. \" I ? What use ? \" repeated the interpreter. \" I stay\u2014 I console the pilgrims. Suppose I go,\" he added ; \" pilgrims perhaps Aveep much and get angry, and kill the captain.\" Lanxon kneAV that he was not a ' persona grata ' Avith the interpreter. Interpreters on these journeys Avith pilgrims usually manage to make a good deal of money out of the poor pilgrims over and above the pay they get from the ship ; for they are the only intermediaries betAvixt the pilgrims on the one hand and the captain and the cook and the steAvard on the other, and there are a hundred Avays offered them of levying blackmail in the form of ' back-"], [273, "XXI MARIAM 265 sheesh.' But in this instance Lanxon and Ismar stood in the interpreter's Avay ; for Lanxon kneAV more Arabic than the latter did English : which made the pilgrims independent and able to appeal directly to the authorities to avoid extortion. There fore the interpreter regarded Lanxon in particular Avith as much hatred as one man can bear toAvards another. And to this feeling Lanxon attributed his disinclination to go Avith him. As a matter of fact, the interpreter kneAV very well that the station lay much farther aAvay than he had represented ; that the wind was against the boat, and likeAvise a very strong current ; that the sun Avould set and the night fall before the boat Avould reach the station : and he did not fancy the idea of risking himself in a small boat in the midst of a sea full of sharks, far away from the ship, in a dark night. He had suggested the idea to some of the pilgrims, and they had promised him a big 'backsheesh ' if he succeeded in persuading the captain to attempt it. So that he only wished to see the boat set out, and possessed no further ambition. But Ismar was close by. He laughed. \" Never mind the pilgrims, O Hadj-Abbas,\" he said ; \" I will ansAver for them. Since you are the only one who has been here before, you should go in the boat. It will soon be dark and difficult to find one's way.\" Thus driven into a corner, Hadj-Abbas exclaimed that he was most willing to do anything that was required of him. The boat Avas being loAvered. No seamen could be spared, so the captain sent fonvard to ask the firemen who had just come off duty if they would volunteer. At first they demurred."], [274, "266 MARIAM CHAP. The duties of firemen and seamen are sharply marked out from each other, and each resents being expected to perform the Avork of the other section. But Avhen the facts of the case were represented to the firemen and they Avere assured that it Avas only a job of half an hour or so, they changed their minds and volunteered. So the donkeyman \u2014 the foreman of the firemen \u2014 and four men took their seats Avith the interpreter, and Lanxon steered, with the ship's papers secure in his breast-pocket. No tiller could be found at the moment, and Lanxon had to hang on to the rudder Avith his hands so as to keep the boat straight \u2014 a matter which soon turned out to be one of great difficulty in face of the strong cur rent. They set out briskly, but had not gone fifty yards before the boat Avas full of Avater ; for it had been blistered and Avarped by the sun during the eighteen days of the voyage, and the seams let the sea in Avith the greatest of ease. They had a small baler Avith them ; but this proved so inadequate for the purpose that they had hastily to put back. Once alongside the ship, the donkeyman climbed up the rope and regained the deck. He had lost all stomach for the adventure. The interpreter also begged hard to be alloAved to go on board for a minute : he said he had forgotten something. But Lanxon, Avho had begun to feel that this Avas likely to turn out a serious business, told him that if he tried to leave the boat he would chuck him into the sea. Tavo pails Avere noAv throAvn to them to serve as balers ; and, another fireman volunteering as a substitute for the donkeyman, they set out once more, full of spirits, and singing and jesting as they"], [275, "XXI MARIAM 267 bent to the Avork. Even Avith the tAvo balers, hoAv ever, it was all they could do to keep the boat afloat, and their situation Avas hardly one of comfort, as the Avater inside Avell-nigh reached the seats, and their progress Avas necessarily sIoav. As they passed under the stern of the ship, Lanxon heard a soft laugh, and lifting his head, beheld Mariam leaning over the railing. \" By Allah ! \" she said, \" if you were to challenge the lightning, you Avould leave it far behind in the race.\" Considering all the circumstances, the words Avere someAvhat cruel. But there was that in the tone in Avhich they were uttered that dispelled all idea of cruelty. It Avas evident that both the laugh and the Avords Avere forced, and only used as a cloak Avhere- Avith to cover other and very different feelings. And the cloak proved so transparent, and the dying mur mur of her voice left behind it such a revelation of anxious tenderness, that if Lanxon's senses were not at that moment fully occupied Avith other mat ters, he Avould have liked to institute a philosophic inquiry on the subject. On the brave lads roAved, and slowly crept toAvards the distant point. It was four o'clock before they started for the second time, and an hour passed before they came sufficiently near to the point to see what lay beyond it. Alas ! no station, but only another point far aAvayin the distance. \" I thought you said,\" growled Lanxon to the interpreter in Arabic, \"that the station lay just be yond this point ? \" \" No, no,\" returned the other, cheerfully and point-"], [276, "268 MARIAM CHAP. ing toAvards the one ahead, \" that one, that one ! Do I not tell you ? \" They passed the point, and lost sight of the ship. This cast a gloom over their spirits. The ship to them in these strange and unknoAvn climes represent ed home and safety. When she Avas hidden from their eyes, and they found themselves Avandering about the sea alone in a frail little boat full of Avater in quest of an unknoAvn station, Avith only the Avord of the interpreter to depend upon that there Avas such a station and that they were on the right Avay to it, and the gloom around them deepening so rapidly that they Avould soon not be able to see a yard in front of them, and not a light or a sign anywhere about them by which they could tell Avhere they Avere or direct their course \u2014 Avith the certainty of indefinite imprisonment if they landed and Avere caught by the quarantine police before they had de livered their papers, and the possibility of being murdered by the inhabitants if there were any \u2014 they began to feel depressed. The sun set ; the brilliant twilight colouring lit up the vast expanse above them for a brief space ; then the greys of evening rapidly closed over the heavens and finally enshrouded them in the blackness of night, Avhilst above, the millions of fairy stars Avoke out of their sleep to lead their midnight dance. On and on they rowed, noAv in perfect silence, and draAving closely to each other on the seats, and care fully keeping their hands aAvay from the water. For they kneAV that Avater Avas full of sharks, and they kneAV or believed that sharks ahvays gather in great numbers around a doomed vessel. Indeed a horrible"], [277, "MARIAM 269 XXI whisper had arisen that one of them had actually struck a shark Avith his oar. Noav, look you, there is nothing more repellent to the senses of man both on earth and in the sea than a shark. The very thought of it in the abstract is not a pleasant one ; for there is not a single point in a shark that appeals to the imagination in a kindly manner. It lacks the grace of a serpent. It is neither beautiful nor noble ; it has not an atom of feeling, not one single redeem ing quality. It is the very ideal of an inhuman monster ; the very incarnation of all that is cruel and disgusting, of all that is too horrible to be thought of in the universe. And these firemen for the last six months had been continually in the com panionship of sharks : they had gazed at them from the ship as they gambolled in the liquid depths be low, or devoured all that came in their Avay as if there could be no end to their capacity for gorging ; they had seen their enormous carcases on the shim mering surface of the Avater, their glazed staring eyes filled with a cold calculating intensity of slimy fiendishness sufficient to strike terror in any human being ; they had Avatched them open their cruel hideous jaws and snap huge chunks of everything, even the most disgusting offal, that came in their way, with a sneer, a smile that excelled the uttermost conception of abhorrent selfishness. So that sharks were not shadowy myths to these firemen ; they Avere horrible realities : and they dreaded them. The time Avore on ; it seemed an eternity. Lanx on struck a match and looked at his AA'atch. It was half-past six. A dark mound loomed close to their left \u2014 the point they were making for. They"], [278, "MARIAM 270 CHAr. put on a spurt \u2014 Avith a sigh of relief \u2014 they passed it ; but beyond it there shone no lights : there Avas nothing but impenetrable darkness. The men mur mured. Lanxon turned to the interpreter. \" Where, in the name of the devil, is that station ? \" The interpreter shook his hands in feeble depreca tion. Then he rose to his feet on the tliAvart and cried exultingly : \" There ! there ! I see light, much light. There, Kamaran ! \" No one offered to verify his exclamation, for every movement endangered the safety of the boat. The men called out savagely for the interpreter to sit down. Lanxon silenced them. \" Pull aAvay, my lads ; we must make the best of a bad job. You will have a bottle of Avhiskey Avhen Ave get back.\" He unshipped the rudder, for it was no use to them noAv, as he had neither any idea of the forma tion of the land, nor could he see distinctly the man nearest to him. He took off his sun-topee and started to bale out the Avater Avith it. The interpre ter, Avho felt rather uneasy at the murmurs of the men and thought he had had enough of Avork, com menced talking glibly to Lanxon and telling him many stories concerning his voyages to these parts. But Lanxon silenced him. \" Hold your tongue, my friend,\" he said in Arabic. \" Hold your tongue and Avork. These men are not in a humour to stand any more nonsense. If you don't take care, you may find yourself overboard. We cannot afford any useless Aveight on board this boat. So Avork and be silent.\""], [279, "XXI MARIAM 271 Some time after Lanxon again struck a match and looked at his Avatch. It was eight o'clock, and still they were roAving Avith the energy of desperation ; at one moment apparently out in the sea, at another Avarned by some dark mass looming close to them of the proximity of land. The boat noAV grated over a shallow, noAV bumped against a rock : and the boat Avas in such a condition that it seemed as if every shake were going to be its last. The men had been rowing and baling steadily for four hours. Noav, look you, a fireman's Avork is not easy. Stok ing in the Red Sea is about as arduous a matter as can Avell be conceived. They stoked twelve hours out of the twenty-four. And they had just come up from a shift of six hours, tired and weary and ready for their teas and a sleep, Avhen they Avere induced to undertake their forlorn expedition. Nine o'clock came : and yet no lights and no in dication of the station. The interpreter remained very silent. Things had turned out even Avorse than he had expected ; and he judged it prudent to efface himself for the present, and had given over insisting that they were Avithin a stone's throw of the station. Lanxon, Avho had begun to doubt the existence of such a place anywhere within fifty miles of them, judged it prudent to abandon the attempt. The men Avere beginning to murmur very loudly, and indulged in the utmost license of language concern ing the captain and everybody else concerned in the conception of this wild-goose-chase. Lanxon gave the order to turn. The men suddenly became silent. Then they whispered to each other. \" Beg pardon, sir,\" said one aloud out of the dark-"], [280, "MARIAM CHAP. 272 ness \u2014 \" beg pardon, sir : but Ave'll 'ang on to the job, sir, if you wish.\" \" It is good of you to say so ! \" exclaimed Lanxon. \" You have behaved like splendid felloAvs, all of you. But it is of no use. And Ave must get on board : or at any rate get out into the sea so as to meet the ship. For I have all the ship's papers Avith me, and if she manages to rise at ten and reaches the station Avithout them, it may cause trouble. So back and turn ; Ave shall go back very much quicker, as we have had a very strong current against us all the Avay.\" They turned and pulled back Avith reneAved energy, and found themselves speeding along, Avith much greater rapidity : so great, indeed, that the boat Avent crashing over some rocks onto a jutting point, before they had any idea of the danger. In a mo ment they had sprung out. \" Stick to the oars, my lads ! \" cried Lanxon, \" stick to the oars : Ave may find them useful. As to that boat, the loss of it Avon't matter much, even if Ave cannot recover it to-morroAV.\" This last concussion had indeed rendered the boat utterly incapable of carrying them. They clambered up the rising slope, keeping close together ; and having reached the summit, gazed eagerly back in the direction Avhence they had come, and saAV the lights of the Lornadale. \" There is Kamaran, there is station ! \" exclaimed the interpreter, excitedly. Sure enough, behind them they saAV the lights of the station ensconced in a IioHoav. With a shout they rushed on towards them, careless of Avhat the"], [281, "XXI MARIAM 273 quarantine people might do to them. Fortunately the inspector happened to be in a good humour, and, Avhen he had heard their tale, he lodged them in the quarantine apartments, and promised to date the ar rival of the Lornadale from half-past tAvo o'clock, the hour at which she ran aground. But there was one thing which seemed to puzzle the quarantine doctor. \" Five hours \u2014 five hours ! \" he repeated to himself. \" Per bacco ! Five hours, did you say, you took to come here from the buoy ? \" \" Five hours,\" said Lanxon, stolidly. \" We took our final departure from the ship at four o'clock.\" \" But, well \u2014 it is strange ! \" said the other with a shrug of non-comprehension. \"What is strange? \" queried Lanxon. \" In truth, it is only four miles from here to the buoy \u2014 and even less.\" \" Four miles ! \" exclaimed Lanxon in disgust. \" More like thirty ! \" \" Nay, nay, it is not so. It is, in truth, only four miles.\" And he walked about and gesticulated whilst Lanxon gazed at him in dismay. \" Ah ! I see \u2014 the truth comes to my mind ! \" ex claimed the other. \" Your men start fresh : they work very hard, very hard ; they conquer the cur rent ; they make some progress. Then they get tired ; they labour not so willingly ; the current equals their strength ; then progress ceases : you toss about here and there, but you remain in one posi tion. Ha, ha, ha ! \" T"], [282, "274 MARIAM CHAr. XXI Lanxon retired to bed with an increasing sense of beAvilderment. The Lornadale failed to rise Avith the tide that night, and it Avas not till six o'clock the next morn ing that she came steaming up, and her anchor rattled doAvn in the little bay in front of Kamaran station."], [283, "CHAPTER XXII When Lanxon left the quarantine station the next morning to rejoin the Lornadale, he was doubtful concerning the kind of reception he should receive on board. He had succeeded, no doubt, in his object, but only by the merest chance ; on the other hand, he had lost a boat. And Avhen he came to revieAV the whole affair, it could not fail to tinge itself Avith a kind of Quixotic humour, Avhich he thought very probable that the ship's company Avould seize hold of, and employ in the gratification of that love of chaff which is common to every seaman. No doubt to him and his company, the poor actors in the affair of last night, it appeared, or rather had appeared, a most terrible thing : they had come to think of themselves in the light of very badly treated creatures ; they were quite sure they had roAved at least tAventy miles ; the captain de served hanging for sending them to such a distance in such a crazy little boat : it had, in short, very nearly cost them their lives. But the quarantine inspector assured Lanxon that the distance from the buoy near which the Lornadale had run aground to the station did not exceed four miles at the most. And now in the clear light of the morning sun, and"], [284, "276 MARIAM CHAP. in the knoAvledge that Kamaran AA-as an uninhabited isle Avhich it Avould have been perfectly safe to land on, it seemed very absurd to have Avaited to be cast on shore against their will, instead of landing right abreast of the ship, Avalking over to the station in the cool of the waning afternoon, and getting back to the Lornadale in time for tea. Of course Lanxon had never even heard of Kamaran previous to this voyage : so he could not blame himself for his igno rance concerning the geography and customs of the place. Yet he did not fail to see the humour of the situation : their arduous endeavours ; their behaviour of heroes ; the sacrifices they had deemed abso lutely necessary to ensure their reaching the station \u2014 and all in vain \u2014 Avhen the station might have been reached as easily as the village church on a Sunday morning in any part of England. The floAving of the current past them had imbued them with the idea that they Avere progressing at a great rate. He recalled to mind the profound and mournful sub limity of his OAvn feelings at the moment when he unshipped the rudder and sacrificed his last and only respectable helmet to the exigencies of duty. He Avas agreeably surprised, therefore, Avhen, on gaining the deck, the pilgrims croAvded round his company Avith an air as if nothing in the Avorld would suffice to express the joy and gratitude that filled their bosoms. \" Allah be praised,\" they cried, \" for your safety ! Allah reAvard you for the dangers you have incurred on our behalf ! \" Lanxon Avas rather at a loss. They had lost sight of the ship before the unpleasant part of last night's"], [285, "XXII MARIAM 277 proceedings commenced. But Hadj-Abbas did not Avait for explanation. \"Ah, yes!\" he exclaimed, shaking his head pro foundly. \" By Allah and his holy Prophet, you have no idea ! And all for your sakes ! We have saved you,\" he added impressively, \"over fifteen hours of delay ! \" Hadj-Abbas' main object in life was the acquisi tion of backsheesh. The captain and Ismar came running fonvard to greet Lanxon. The mystery was now explained. The Lornadale had come across the remains of their boat floating gently on the bosom of the sea in the golden sunshine of the morning ; and it had been naturally assumed by all on board that it had sunk after they had lost sight of it, and that Lanxon and his companions had become the prey of sharks. \" The ladies of his Excellency the Sheikh,\" said Ibrahim the slave to Lanxon, \" desire to speak with you.\" Lanxon entered the tent on the quarter-deck. He was wholly unprepared for the signs of emotion he plainly witnessed on the faces before him. Mariam had certainly been shedding tears : her face was flushed and happy, but her eyes were still moist. And the expression in them was such that it overcame him for a moment, and caused him to gaze at her in beAvilderment. He had never seen her look SAveeter, gentler, and happier than at the present moment. Yet the happiness Avas like sunshine Avhich has just struggled through thick clouds, and is dispersing them, and lights up the glistening drops that hang like jeAvels from every object and peep out from"], [286, "278 MARIAM CHAr. betAvixt the petals of delicate floAvers refreshed. It revealed the traces of past and violent sorroAv; though these traces, under its influence, rendered her all the more charming. And the thought fleAv like lightning through Lanxon's consciousness that this sorroAv and this happiness Avere caused by interest in himself. This thought staggered him. An occasional sniff from Ayesha betrayed the fact that she had also lately suffered from a paroxysm of tears. Im -Abdallah's face Avas grave. As for Was seefy and the other inmates, more Avoe-begone faces than they presented on this occasion had never come Avithin Lanxon's experience. But they had not the happiness that beamed out of Mariam's eyes. In deed, Lanxon aftenvards heard that as soon as the rumour of the catastrophe had spread, the Avhole of the sixty Avomen on board had started sobbing and shrieking in unison, as if their hearts Avere about to break. \" You have done well,\" said Im-Abdallah, nodding her head impressively. \" By Allah, you have done well!\" \" Aye, by Allah ! \" chorussed the others. Lanxon shrugged his shoulders in deprecation of this praise. \"You have,\" continued Im-Abdallah, \"run great risks in a matter Avhich was of no importance to you but of great importance to us.\" Lanxon reflected that these people probably thought that the boat had sunk immediately after they had lost sight of it ; that he and his companions had fought their way to the shore in spite of sharks \u25a0their appearance Avas sufficiently draggled and for-"], [287, "XXII MARIAM 279 lorn to warrant this supposition \u2014 and had at once made their Avay to the station. There Avas some thing very noble and romantic about this view of the affair. It lacked the tinge of the ludicrous that hovered around the other picture. Lanxon reflected that it Avas just as well that Providence had under taken the direction of affairs, and had shoAvn them up in a light which secured due appreciation for their labours ; for he kneAV Mariam sufficiently to feel that not all the actual heroism of the latter Avould prevent her from laughing at him if she got Avind of the real facts of the case. Her sense of humour Avould have proved fatal to the romance of the deed : and the romance that at present enveloped it Avas too pleasing to be ruthlessly destroyed. He decided to let it be : especially as it Avas perfectly certain that Hadj-Abbas would not endanger it. That Avorthy Avould not alloAV the chances of in creased backsheesh he derived from the good offices of the imaginations of his audience to be affected by any personal feelings of spite. \"You are a brave man,\" continued Im-Abdallah. \"And the highest form of bravery is that which is shoAvn in behalf of others.\" \" Nay, my lady,\" cried Lanxon, \" I am no more worthy of praise than any of the men who were with me.\" \"They also,\" admitted Im-Abdallah, \"acted Avell. We are grateful to them. But more especially are we grateful to you. For yours Avas the thought Avhich concerned itself Avith us.\" \" Besides,\" cried Ayesha, \" you are a doctor.

And yet you pressed"], [288, "280 MARIAM CHAP fonvard, and refrained not even when the boat filled rapidly Avith water, and your eyes Avere opened to the danger of the undertaking.\" \" When a man undertakes anything,\" quoth Lanxon, \" he should carry it out in despite of all obstacles.\" \" But you did not look happy, nevertheless, Avhen you Avent forth the second time,\" said Mariam Avith a laugh. \" You seemed to be very much afraid lest the Avater should spoil your boots and your clothes. And you had on such Avhite clothes, and such shining boots, and such a beautiful silk sash. And noAV, alas ! your appearance is very different, and even your hat has been afflicted by the fierce assaults of the Avater.\" In anticipation of his approaching interview with the quarantine doctor, Lanxon had indeed, previous to the running aground of the Lornadale, arrayed himself with especial care, so as duly to maintain the dignity of the university of Avhich he Avas a grad uate. He sighed as he thought of the reckless manner in Avhich he had sacrificed his helmet \u2014 yesterday so trim and Avhite, to-day utterly devoid of shape and glaringly offensive in the multitude of patterns with Avhich it Avas stained and besmudged. When you come to think of it, the hat is a very im portant part of a man's costume. It expresses his character in a unique manner. According to the state of his hat and the way he Avears it will our judgment concerning him vary. If he wears it straight, he is a respectable member of society. If he Avears it on the back of his head, he is looked at askance : he carries about with him a Avorld of hidden"], [289, "XXII MARIAM 281 possibilities ; he may develop into anything ; he may, for aught we knoAv, shock our feelings. If on the side, there is no further question : ladies avoid him. If he tilts it right doAvn over his eyebrows, he is, if otherAvise sprucely dressed, an empty-headed dude : if carelessly dressed, he is a man with a hobby. And if a man's hat is outrageously shabby and he has no chance of replacing it, he is in a bad way. This Avas the case with Lanxon. The firemen were rather mystified by the novel atmosphere that surrounded them on board the Lornadale as a consequence of their exploit. Their dull imaginations did not at first rise to the occasion. They had a distinct impression that they had some how been humbugged. But Hadj-Abbas took an early opportunity of explaining to them the neAV state of things, and impressing them Avith the desi rability of being viewed in the light of the heroic rather than of the ludicrous. Thus stimulated, they became seized Avith a proper sense of ambition, and talked and posed Avith a surpassing effect, so as to elicit a continual chorus of admiration and wonder from the lines of Hadjis who came from all parts of the vessel and squatted around and gazed on them. No one was more grateful to Lanxon, to Hadj- Abbas, and to the brave firemen than the poor pilot Salim. He had passed the night quaking in abject terror on the bridge, for he was well assured that his days were numbered if his carelessness proved to have seriously delayed the voyage and thus threat ened to render abortive the scheme of the pilgrimage. Now he ventured to descend and stretch his limbs on the deck, and listened with becoming humility to"], [290, "282 MARIAM CHAr. XXII the observations of the reverent Hadjis. They Avere no longer hard on him, but treated him with mercy, and gently admonished him concerning the doAvn- Avard path of the drunkard, Avhich they fancied he betrayed a tendency to pursue. They Avere presently visited by the quarantine secretary, who spent a couple of hours on board, receiving the quarantine dues from each individual pilgrim. Many of the latter hid themselves aAvay in odd corners to avoid payment ; but they Avere rigo rously hunted up by Ismar and others. On those, hoAvever, Avho Avere too poor to pay Im-Abdallah took compassion, and defrayed their expenses. Then the quarantine doctor came on board in com pany Avith Lanxon, and made an inspection of the ship, and praised highly the sanitary condition in which he found it, Avhich, he said, exceeded that of any other pilgrim-ship he had come across. It sug gested itself to Lanxon that perhaps there were not people like Mariam on board those other ships. And finally, at half-past tAvo o'clock, the anchor Avas raised, and the Lornadale steamed out on the last stage of her voyage to Jeddah."], [291, "CHAPTER XXIII FOR some days past there had been much bathing, and trimming of beards and shaving of heads \u2014 amongst the men \u2014 going on ; for perfect cleanliness of body and neatness of appearance is essential to the due performance of the rite the time for Avhich had noAv arrived : the assumption of the ' Hiram,' or sacred costume, Avithout Avhich no believer can enter the circle around Mecca within Avhich the functions of the actual pilgrimage began. They arrived oppo site a certain place called Yelumlum at midnight, and the Lornadale's engines ceased Avorking for ten or fifteen minutes ; and then arose from the ship a roar of human voices, shouting ' Allahuma, Lebeyk ! Le beyk, Allahuma ! ' and various other forms of adora tion Avith Avhich each pilgrim saluted Allah and consecrated himself for his approaching duties as he assumed the ' ihram.' The noise was appalling in the suddenness Avith Avhich it arose in the midst of the stillness and mystery of the night, and, as each group of pilgrims adopted its own time and its own key, someAvhat distressing to such as had any deli cacy of aural perception and were not carried aAvay by the same religious fervour Avhich appeared at this moment to have bereft them of their senses ; giving rise, in consequence, to many exclamations of an"], [292, "284 MARIAM CHAr. opposite nature from the disgusted members of the slumbering ship's company. The 'ihram' for men consisted of tAvo white mantles, one Avrapped round the Avaist and falling beloAv the knees or as far doAvn as the ankles; the other hanging over one shoulder and draAvn round the body, but leaving the other shoulder bare. The 'ihram' for Avomen consisted of Avhite robes unrelieved by any tinge of colour and devoid of all ornaments. Lanxon opened his eyes the next morning at the change that had taken place in the appearance of the decks. No more figures in floAving robes and stately turbans. Bare heads, bare shoulders, bare legs, and bare feet Avere seen in plenty ; the rest of male humanity contented itself with the 'ihram,' which \u2014 after one got over the first dash of humour provoked by it \u2014 Avas not at all an ungraceful cos tume, though scanty. The Avomen in their Avhite robes, and muffled up with more than ordinary cir cumspection in Avhite shrouds, added to the uncanny air of the picture. There Avas something visionary about the Avhiteness of everything in the glare of the morning sun. It engendered a suspicion that these good people meditated becoming angels in all seri ousness. After this ceremony, and until the pilgrimage Avas over, it was not alloAved to them to wear any other garment, nor shoes, nor head-covering. Sandals they might Avear, but Avith nothing to cover the feet. Whilst at rest they could make use of umbrellas. Of umbrellas the pilgrims had a plentiful store, of vari ous patterns ; but green Avas the colour most in vogue, for green is the colour sacred to the Prophet. It Avas"], [293, "XXIII MARIAM 285 rather ludicrous to see these queerly-clad but very solemn-looking figures strutting up and down the decks beneath the aAvnings, with green umbrellas open above them. There Avas not the slightest necessity for them to use the umbrellas, but they seemed to have taken their fancy. They were not supposed to make use of these umbrellas whilst pro gressing towards Mecca : whilst on the move, they had to trust to Allah and not shield themselves from the sun. At one time the question arose Avhether it Avas laAvful for them to remain under the aAvnings of the ship Avhich Avas carrying them toAvards their des tination. It Avas represented that the captains of these ships, who Avere unbelieving dogs, Avould not alloAV the aAvnings to be removed : and the religious authorities declared that in such case of necessity their sin would be pardoned on the sacrifice of an extra sheep Avhen they had landed. On hearing this the captain offered to have the aAvnings of the Lorna dale removed at once. But this great magnanimity filled the pilgrims Avith consternation, and they be sought him earnestly not to do this, as they preferred paying for the sheep to dying from sunstroke. In deed, every little transgression they committed during the pilgrimage they had to atone for by the slaughter of a sheep : and these transgressions were numerous, for if a fly settled on them they were not supposed to kill it, and if anybody struck them they must not swear at him. Thousands upon thousands of sheep are sacrificed in this way every year, and the shepherds of Arabia drive a good business and pray every year that the sins of their brethren may be increased."], [294, "286 MARIAM CHAP. But other things engrossed Lanxon's mind during these hours, as the Lornadale hastened omvard to the end of this eventful journey. Ever since the morn ing at Kamaran, indeed, Avhen he unexpectedly ap peared on board and surprised Mariam almost in the act of weeping for his loss, a great uneasiness had come over his mind \u2014 an uneasiness of no definite character : a vague, unsatisfactory sort of uneasiness. He Avas not conscious of any reason for this uneasi ness; he therefore asked himself Avhy he Avas uneasy, and found that, instead of ansAvering him, his mind lost itself in a reverie. Time after time he forced himself out of that state of reverie, and by a painful exercise of his poAvers of volition brought the same question Avell to the fore in his mental field of vision. \" What is the matter Avith me ? Am I going to shiver and presently burn Avith the fiery heat of the ague, or is anything else going to happen that I knoAv of?\" But this question never managed to glimmer amidst the general murkiness of his thoughts for more than a second or tAvo ; its light quickly faded, and his mind, under pretence of seeking for an answer to it, Avent off again rioting helplessly amidst the shadoAvs of vacuity. His mind, indeed, Avas unable to come to his res cue Avith its accumulated stores of logical experience. All that he Avas conscious of belonged to the dim, vague Avorld of presentiment. Presentiment grows from seed that has fallen at odd times on the falloAv but uncared-for regions of the receptive faculties, and grows in obscurity undisturbed by the searching analysis of consciousness. He felt that the light of his OAvn being Avas assuming most fantastic hues \u2014"], [295, "XXIII MARIAM 287 hues such as he had not observed in it before ; hues that threatened soon to give an entirely neAV colour to the current of his thoughts, to the flame of his emotion, to the soul of his individuality: and he Avatched these new and Avonderful hues, not daring to inquire into their origin or speculate on their tendencies, but simply Avaiting in suspense for their natural development. He felt that the atmosphere that surrounded him Avas filling itself Avith influences altogether out of the normal \u2014 influences emanating from points that eluded his vision ; influences that thickened and sharpened in intensity as the moments flew by and the ship sped on her course: and he Avatched these influences, not speculating, not inquir ing, not applying to them the processes of analysis, but silently watching them in a maze of beAvilderment. He Avas conscious that his relations Avith Mariam and, in a lesser degree, Avith the other ladies of the quarter-deck had undergone some vast but subtle change. He saw it plainly enough in their general behaviour, in their manner of speech to him. Had his eyes been open, he might have seen this change long before the morning at Kamaran. But he had not seen it. The light that revealed it to him was the light that streamed from Mariam's eyes in that single moment Avhen the excess of her sorroAv and the revulsion of her feelings at his appearance had laid open to his vision the innermost casket of her emotions. Into this he had taken one glimpse \u2014 one glimpse that he could not help himself from taking. It had sufficed to break through the armour of his consciousness, guarded and blinded as it was by old memories and preconceived ideas, to a certain extent,"], [296, "288 MARIAM CHAP. and impress him with the knoAvledge that there Avas a change. But of the nature of this change, and of the direction in which it tended, he Avas not aAvare. Certain as he Avas \u2014 or believed himself to be \u2014 of his OAvn stanchness to the memories that centred around the photograph Avhich he constantly carried about with him ; certain as he Avas \u2014 or believed him self to be \u2014 of the immense gulf that yaAvned betAvixt him and Mariam, and made it impossible that they should ever join hands in friendship, far less hearts in love ; certain as he was \u2014 and in this point he Avas not merely certain but correct \u2014 of Ismar's love for Ma riam : certain as he was \u2014 or tried to be \u2014 that Mariam either did love Ismar or would in the very near future : certain as he Avas on all these different points, the mystification to Avhich he Avas subjected, both by internal sensations and external influences that did not at all coincide with the spirit of these certainties, may Avell be imagined. But Avhilst he remained in this state of mystifica tion and contented himself Avith Avondering at the single spark of light that glimmered through its foggy depths \u2014 the presentiment that something very unexpected Avas going to happen \u2014 others Avere seeing things straight before them and thinking over them, and acting according to their thoughts. \" Friend Lanxon,\" said Ismar to him that night \u2014 it was the last night of the voyage, the last night they Avould be at sea together ; and around them reigned a stillness almost mournful, a stillness of the humanity near them, a stillness of the 'heavens above them \u2014 \" Friend Lanxon, Avhat do you propose doing to-morrow?\""], [297, "MARIAM 289 XXIII Lanxon started. His friend's voice, rather than his words, seemed to stir his feelings, to ruffle them, to quicken them into a quivering animation. But, after a pause, he only ansAvered : \"To-morroAv \u2014 Ave arrive at Jeddah.\" Ismar nodded gravely. \"To-morrow,\" he repeated, \"we arrive at Jeddah. Inshallah ! And then ? \" Lanxon shrugged his shoulders. \" And then,\" he said\u2014\" Avhat then ? \" He recognized the question as the same one that had been trying to formulate itself in his mind during the Avhole of the day. Ismar remained silent aAvhile. \"Friend Lanxon,\" he again said, \"why do you not come Avith us ? \" \" Eh ? \" This time Lanxon turned and stared at his com panion. The advance from the regions of the unknoAvn to the land of reality utterly overAvhelmed him. A faint echo in his OAvn breast warned him that the thought Avas not quite a stranger there, though he had been unconscious of its presence. Ismar met his inquiring gaze and said : \" Why should you return to the West ? \" \" Because I belong to the West,\" Lanxon merely answered. Ismar shrugged his shoulders. \"What is there in the West that should prevent you coming to us ? \" he said. \" Is it religion ? \" \" For one thing,\" said Lanxon. \" The religion that creates barriers betwixt man and man,\" said Ismar, \" must necessarily be false, in U"], [298, "MARIAM CHAP. 290 that it cuts aAvay the ground from beneath its OAvn feet. True religion must derive its commission from the Universal God of heaven, and its commis sion must therefore be a universal one, to embrace all men and draAv them together.\" Lanxon remained silent. He could hardly realize the sense of Avhat Ismar was saying to him. His mind shot beyond the Avords that he heard, and hungered to knoAv Avhat Avas the ultimate meaning of them. There seemed to exist a feeling within himself that had suddenly groAvn to a head, and only Avaited to learn that ultimate meaning of Ismar's before bursting its bonds of subjection and asserting itself master of his Avhole being. \" That it should be a reason, therefore, for separa tion,\" continued Ismar after a pause, \" is Avithout the bounds of reason ; nor could it possibly be so except when its purity is sullied by the principles of egoism and repulsion which come to us from beloAv, from the animal natures Avhich continue the tradi tions of a brutal state of isolation. The great Teachers of humanity, enlightened Avith a greater share of the essences from above, Avere all universal in character; their folloAvers alone, clogged Avith the Aveight of mud Avhich still adheres to them in their half-risen state from the slough of brutality, strive to seize hold of and magnify every point about them Avhich would encourage the opposite. The burden of their teaching Avas the same \u2014 a reverence for God on high, a reverence for man on earth : all else Avere but variations due to the customs of the peoples surrounding them, and the exigencies of the times in Avhich they lived. Whether you call your-"], [299, "MARIAM XXIII 291 self a folloAver of Christ, of Mohamed, of Buddha, or of Confucius, what matters it ? They themselves lived for the same great purpose, and in that pur pose Avould, Avithout doubt, have joined hands. He who Avould pit the one against the other makes of their names great stumbling-blocks to humanity, uses their individual excellencies for very base ends.\" It struck Lanxon at the moment, Avith a force that surprised him, hoAv different was the effect that Ismar produced on him compared to that Avhich usually folloAved his outbursts of thought. He spoke Avith earnestness and, to all outward seeming, Avith the full intention of his Avords. But there lacked the fire of inner enthusiasm, the energy of constraining influence, that at other times floAved from him and Avrapt Lanxon up in the very spirit of his utterance despite his OAvn wish. Now his lan guage Avas gifted Avith all the mechanical poAver of expression, with all the acuteness of understanding, that belonged to Ismar ; but his soul, instead of lighting it all up Avith the gloAv of life, seemed re pressed. A sense of Aveary gloom overspread, in stead, his Avords. It came as a suspicion to Lanxon's thought that Ismar Avas at this moment acting \u2014 executing a command, not speaking his own desire. \" But to Avhat does all this tend ? \" he said. \" Ad mitting that all you say is true, it still remains the same, that I am a Western. Do you purpose to convert me?\" Ismar raised his head and laughed \u2014 a not over joyous laugh."], [300, "MARIAM 292 CHAP. \"Aye. Inshallah!\" he returned. \"To convert you, not from your ideals, but to our practice. The ideal of all humanity is ahvays and ever the same : reverence for God in heaven and reverence for the image of God that is in Himself on earth. Our ultimate ideals being identical, it must matter little to you AA-hether you live in the West or in the East.\" \" But why should I forsake the West ? \" merely ansAvered Lanxon. Ismar paused again, striving in silence with con flicting thoughts. \" Friend Lanxon,\" he said at last, \"give your ear to my Avords and come Avith us, and it shall be well Avith you. We will provide you Avith house and horses, food and slaves, furniture and guns. And even for a Avise you shall not Avant.\" \"What Avise ? Whence come these Avords?\" burst forth from Lanxon. Again Ismar laughed. \" I thought the light of understanding Avould not long delay from flooding your mind. Verily they are the Avords that express the sentiments of both the lady Mariam and her noble mother.\" \" But Avhat does it all mean ? \" cried Lanxon with a sudden fall in his tones, a sudden faintness of his voice. \" What does it all mean ? \" \"It means,\" said Ismar, \"that the ladies have considered the spirit of your Avords, the meaning of your actions, and have come to an agreement agreeable to yourself. It means,\" he added Avith a someAvhat forced and higher voice, \" that you have found favour in the eyes of the high-born and noble Mariam ! \""], [301, "XXIII MARIAM 293 \"Then do these Avords come from the lady Ma riam herself ? \" \" By the Allah Almighty, they come from her self!\" \" Do you mean to say,\" persisted Lanxon, \" that she loves me ? \" \"She deigns to love you, my friend,\" said Ismar Avith a someAvhat scornful emphasis. The Avave of knoAvledge that broke over Lanxon's consciousness at this moment utterly overAvhelmed him. A thousand lights of understanding from a thousand points hitherto shrouded in obscurity flashed all at once on his mind, and dazzled it. He staggered as if struck. But as quickly there suc ceeded another Avave, one of amazement, of stupe faction, of beAvilderment. \"And is it you, O Ismar,\" he cried, making a step forward toAvards the latter Avith eyes Avide open with Avonder, and searching through the darkness for the lineaments of his face \u2014 \"is it you Avho tell me this? You \u2014 you ! Was I, then, mistaken in thinking that you \u2014 \" But he stopped short. For he felt even through the darkness the despair of the gesture that followed his Avords, as Ismar's lips quivered and he turned away, and lifted up his hand on high, entreatingly and commandingly, to dam back the questioning torrent of Avords. Thus they stood for a moment ; then Ismar's form became less distinct and noise lessly vanished in the farther gloom, leaving behind it only the echo of a deep-draAvn sigh, full of weari ness of spirit, that came to Lanxon's ears."], [302, "CHAPTER XXIV LANXON gained his hammock, and lay on it, and lost himself in the Avhirl of thought that the Avords of Ismar had awakened in his bosom. At first everything seemed so strange, so astounding; the flood of light that had fallen upon him so dazed his faculties that he felt powerless to see his Avay through the maze of possibilities that presented itself to his vieAV. He lay in silence, utterly helpless and unable to control the shadoAvy fancies that hovered around him, called suddenly into life by the knoAvledge that Mariam loved him. Yet noAv as he lay, with hands clasped above his head, and eyes fixed on vacancy, dreaming and fur tively turning out the hidden recesses of his mind, the idea seemed less unfamiliar to the latter than it certainly Avas to his consciousness. It is a psychical fact of great interest that the likings, aims, and tendencies of our natures may be setting irresistibly in one direction, Avhilst Ave ourselves are under the impression that they a*-e still running in another. The conscious part of a man is not the Avhole of him. It is only by constant self-examination that Ave can keep in vieAV the constant Avorkings of that conglomeration of forces Avhich Ave call self. And"], [303, "MARIAM CHAP. XXIV 295 noAV as he gradually entered into a more rigid phase of examination, it appeared to him that the idea of Mariam had made itself very familiar to his inner most thoughts. And in a moment he Avent still farther and dis covered that all his thoughts, the yearnings of his spirit, the desires of his heart, turned toAvards her, driven by an irresistible force, a very upheaval of his nature. Suddenly and Avith all-pervading light the knoAvledge of himself flooded his Avhole being : he aAvoke to the fact that he loved her \u2014 loved her in spite of all the restraints of fond memory ; restraints that were noAv rapidly disappearing, like clouds be fore a burst of sunshine. And the fierce gloAv of passion that touched him and burnt him at the mo ment of this revelation betrayed the strength and depth of these feelings, content though they had been to vegetate in obscurity till Mariam herself by the magic of her influence called them forth to burst all bonds and declare themselves in sympathy with those that she had herself revealed in her bosom. Like the Avater from the rock, they gushed forth at the touch of her Avand, and proved SAveet indeed to him Avho had thirsted for them in ignorance of their existence. And yet Avhen his thought returned to the love that possessed him before he met Mariam, it struck him Avith Avonder to find it not vanished. But the love that sees before it long years of Avaiting must needs spin itself out to a very fine texture ; differing Avholly from the living and ardent emotion that throbbed in his heart and drew him toAvards Mariam. His thought touched the past Avith a soft and linger-"], [304, "296 MARIAM CHAP. ing endearment ; when it turned to the present it caught the sense of the reality of Mariam, and flamed up around it in a whirl of passion, and lifted him toAvards her with a madness of yearning, and blotted all else from his mental horizon. Nor is this very Avonderful Avhen Ave consider Mariam : the infinite charms of her person, rendered infinite to his senses by the very limits Avhich she imposed on them, the very mystery Avith Avhich she enshrouded them ; the exquisite grace of her understanding, the vivid play of her imagination, the boundless SAvay of her poAvers of control. What man in the position of Lanxon Avould have failed to love Mariam, if Mariam loved him ? And noAv with the veil of false theory with drawn from his eyes, Avith the restraints of old memories deprived of their poAvers, he saAV the events of the past three Aveeks as he had not seen them be fore. He saAV that she had loved him for some time past, long before the morning at Kamaran ; and he laughed as he thought of the simple innocent Avay in which he had exposed himself to the influences that she rained on him derived from her love : utterly unconscious that every one of those darts pierced home to his heart, to rankle there in obscurity and produce all the greater mischief. He laughed at the sublime foolishness that had made him take no heed of the vague sensations that disturbed the smooth current of his feelings that time when they drank coffee. He had then been so sure that he could never love a person so unknown to him as Mariam, so divided from him by race and thought, that it had not even occurred to him to think of such a possibility, even Avhen he Avas conscious of feelings which, under"], [305, "XXIV MARIAM 297 other circumstances, he Avould have attributed to the influence of love. And yet the love had come ! Whence had it come ? What, in the name of all that was Avonderful, had induced her, a princess, sur rounded by friends and slaves, possessed of wealth and power, to look on him, a European, with hardly a penny in his pocket, with nothing particular to boast of, and not even, in the worn-out, limp-look ing, perspiring state Avhich is common to Europeans in the Red Sea and Persian Gulf \u2014 a state of general shabbiness Avhich is not improved by the garments they affect \u2014 looking at his best (indeed Lanxon candidly admitted to himself that heAvas a miserable looking object) ; \u2014 Avhat, in the name of all that was Avonderful, had induced her to regard him Avith favour \u2014 actually to fall in love Avith him ? And here there occurred to him the thought that if he married Mariam, in their future ' menage,' accord ing to Arabian custom, it Avould not be he Avho Avould be master, but she Avho Avould be mistress. For she Avas of a noble family, a princess ; he Avas nobody. Yet after a moment there seemed nothing terrible in the thought. A lover, so long as he is a lover, likes nothing better than being a slave to his mistress : and Mariam had a Avay of being kind to her slaves. It must be admitted that the fact that she had, practically, proposed to him someAvhat jarred on his prejudices. It is not Avithin the nature of an Eng lishman to view with equanimity such an opposite line of conduct to Avhat he considers the only natural course of things. Of course he Avas unconscious that he had himself made Avhat, in her eyes, was tantamount to a declaration of love and therefore"], [306, "298 MARIAM CHAP. equh'alent to a proposal of marriage, and that her action Avas in reality merely a gracious sanction of the same. Lanxon Avas inclined to think that she had been someAvhat bold and independent in the matter. He admitted, Avith a sigh, that she Avas rather given to be bold and independent. Not that there Avas anything akin to boldness about her, in the ordinary sense of the term Avhen applied to ladies. Immodesty was so impossible a thing in the atmosphere that hung about Mariam that it Avas simply absurd to think of it in connection with her. And he remembered that Khadijah had proposed to the future Prophet Mohamed, and consoled himself with the reflection that there was precedent in the matter. No doubt it Avas part of the neAV order of things to which he Avould have to accustom himself. And as he thought, he fell asleep. And in his sleep there came to him a dream. And behold ! he saAV in this dream, rising before himself, the figure of his betrothed, and around her other figures represent ing the life of the West that belonged to him : his home, his friends, his thoughts, his ambitions, his habits. But all these figures had little substance about them ; they Avere mere vague shadoAvs, rendered pale and spectre-like, cold and inanimate, by a long Aveary distance both of time and space that separated him from them. In many points the kinship betAvixt them had been severed ; for he had got neAV ideas and imbibed neAV influences. They had in them but little life, and Avhat life they had hardly appealed to him. And on the other side of him there arose another figure : a figure glowing Avith all the intensity of life, Avith all the attractiveness of Avomanhood \u2014 the"], [307, "XXIV MARIAM 299 figure of Mariam. She stood there Avith her shroud falling over her head, doAvn one side of her face, and Avrapt round her person. And she looked at him with eyes that smote him through and through and left him no poAver of thought or action : so that he yielded himself to the influence that she exerted on him and turned toAvards her. But suddenly, Avith the SAvift ness of lightning, there arose another figure betAvixt them : a Avild and haggard figure with quivering lips and upraised arm \u2014 the figure of Ismar. And he cried out in a loud voice and said : \" Back, false hearted friend ! You take from me my hope, my life. Who am I that I should not kill you ?\" And so great AAras the agony of this cry that Lanxon aAvoke. The moon shed its soft still light around him ; and around in harmony Avith the light there reigned an all-pervading stillness. And through this still ness there reached him a softly-uttered murmur, a murmur of Avords \u2014 the self-same murmur of the self same Avords. Fascinated by the rhythm of the sound, rising and falling in the aAvful stillness of the night, and urged by feelings that had suddenly risen within his own bosom, Lanxon grappled with his hammock, and noiselessly reversed his position so that his head came Avhere his feet had been, and he crept to the edge and looked down below him Avhere Ismar usually passed the night. He lay there as usual, Avith a cloak over him, gazing with wide-open eyes at the moon, and the moon shining back Avith its holy light in his face. He was restless, and moaned uneasily from time to time. And his lips kept moving and muttering, and from his muttering"], [308, "MARIAM 300 CHAP. lips came ahvays the self-same murmur of the self same Avords : but Avith too faint a sound for their sense to be distinguished by Lanxon a feAV feet above him. And Lanxon looked doAvn upon him, and a great Avave of mingled feelings came over him. Poor Ismar ! What about him in this neAV arrangement of circumstances ? He had been for gotten, left out utterly in the cold : displaced from the position which should have been his by an inter loper, a stranger, an alien, an acquaintance of three Aveeks : a man inferior to himself in almost every respect. And yet Avhat a grand felloAv he Avas ; hoAv full of everything that Avas of the best in manhood ; hoAv noble had been his conduct in this very matter ! The Avave of light that had flooded Lanxon's under standing that night had not yet touched Ismar ; but noAv he thought of Ismar, Avith the echo of that terrible cry which had come to him in his dream \u2014 perhaps from heaven \u2014 ringing in his ears. He understood noAV, and he Avondered as he understood. For Ismar loved Mariam : and the love of a man like Ismar Avas not of little account. But he had seen from the first, in his knoAvledge of Mariam, Avhat had been hidden from Lanxon ; nay, he had evidently guessed AA'hat Avas passing in Lanxon's mind whilst yet Lanxon himself had remained un conscious. And he had given Avay : he Avho had the poAver, if he had Avished to exert it, of severing all communication betwixt Lanxon and Mariam, had given way. There had been, no doubt, a terrible struggle : Lanxon remembered the time Avhen Ismar avoided him, Avhen he looked at him in a manner that Avas Avholly inexplicable to Lanxon then, but"], [309, "MARIAM XXIV 301 which was now easily explained. And his sense of justice had conquered : though most men Avould have cried out against there being anything akin to justice in Allah's according to this stranger, this alien, what he had withheld from him, he had let things proceed Avithout the slightest interference ; on the contrary rather draAving himself aAvay as the bonds betAvixt Mariam and Lanxon Avere draAvn tighter. He had given Avay : he, an Arabian, in Avhose bosom burnt fiercely the flame of indepen dence, and to Avhom it was natural to believe that the highest duty of man lay in seeing that he got Avhat was due to him \u2014 he had given Avay. And this very night he had himself given the last touch to his humiliation by doing what Lanxon had never con ceived it possible that a man should do : by suffering himself to be the means \u2014 since no better lay at hand \u2014 through Avhich the Avoman that he loved Avith all the passion of his southern temperament offered herself to another. And now the agony of it all was shaking his soul. At this moment Ismar sat up ; and the continued murmur of the self-same Avords SAvelled in volume, and reached Lanxon's ears Avith distinctness. \" Al lah, Allah ! \" Avas the burden of the utterance : the name of the God of heaven, the God of Abraham, and the God of Mohamed, and the God of Ismar. And Ismar put forth his hand and opened a box near by, and took therefrom a book or a manuscript, and opened its pages ; but paused for a moment, and in silence gazed out again into infinity. Then with a great sigh he hoarsely uttered the intro ductory formula, \" Bismillah Irrahim Irrahman,\" and beat his head and read in the soft moonlight."], [310, "MARIAM CHAP. 302 A great sense of littleness had come over Lanxon as he lay Avatching him. Ismar tOAvered above him in every respect in his imagination. Moved by a sudden impulse, he slid from his hammock and alighted on the deck noiselessly close to Ismar and touched him gently on the shoulder. Ismar raised his head and gazed at him in silence, hardly mani festing any surprise. And Lanxon gazed at him likeAvise. Then he sat himself down on the carpet ; and Ismar closed the book, but said not a Avord. Thus they sat for some time, each Avrapt in his thoughts and motionless, except Avhen Lanxon took a cigar from his case and gave it to Ismar and lit another for himself : and they smoked, in silence as before. And everything around them Avas silent Avith the silence of unutterable meaning Avhich is the life of the Universe ; only the rhythmical throb of the propeller and the rhythmical fall of the pistons marked the moments as they sped on and carried them toAvards Eternity. And Lanxon broke the silence at last and said : \" My friend, Avhat is this that you have done ? \" And, though they had not yet spoken, Ismar understood him and said Avith a shrug of his shoulders : \" My friend, Avhat must be shall be. It is my Kismet. Trouble not yourself on my account. Allah alone is Avise ; Allah alone knows the begin nings and the endings of all things. Man cannot judge : it is sufficient for him to do his duty.\" Lanxon started. If Ismar had preached to him a sermon an hour long, he could not have affected him more deeply. There are moments in the lives of all men when"], [311, "MARIAM XXIV 303 the spirit that lies beyond things that are seen stands revealed to them; Avhen the selfishness of material interests breaks aAvay so utterly as to leave in its place a sense of the utter spirituality of all things \u2014 Avhen they see the origin of their being in the God avIio created them, and also the origin of all other things in the Universe : and in the new light of fellowship they feel constrained, coerced, and carried aAvay by the essences of love, duty, and reverence Avhich are continually streaming from heaven to earth, and should stream back from earth to heaven. It is in these moments that men do things that puzzle materialist philosophers and utterly confuse their calculations. It Avas a moment of this kind that Avas iioav Avith Lanxon. He regained his hammock in silence, and, sitting there, took a long last look into the moonlight around, and by means of that soft unimpassioned light seemed to see Avith extraordinary clearness the natural harmony of things, the course that duty required of him. Ismar had done his duty. But betAvixt Ismar and Mariam \u2014 and the Avarm gloAV of passion that folloAved the thought of her he firmly choked doAvn, \u2014 betwixt Ismar and Mariam it Avas not for him to interfere. Such an act of selfishness Avould involve a rude disturbance of harmony ; it Avould mean a ruin of lives : Ismar's life at once, Mariam's and his own in the near future \u2014 for it was impossible that he, a Western, should live out the promise of his life as an Eastern \u2014 and the lives of others, perchance, aa71io, though far aAvay, yet had many a claim on him : it Avould mean evil in the sight of God. It had apparently all along been a"], [312, "304 MARIAM CHAP. fight betAvixt himself and Ismar; they still stood face to face, man to man, in conflict : it Avas a fight for honour \u2014 and the one Avould Avin Avho gave Avay most. He sank back in his hammock with a sigh of con tentment, and, Avorn out by the thoughts of the night, fell into a sleep unharassed by dreams. When he awoke in the morning the moonlight had vanished, and the darkness of night still hung over the heavens, and the waters beneath them looked cold and sullen. And first amongst his Avak ing thoughts there came to him the memory of Mariam, and irresistibly over his senses there SAvept the Avave of love : it strove hard to regain its pre eminence in him. And then came the thought of his resolution and other thoughts behind it \u2014 a good and motley creAV, that Avent to battle right royally, but strove against great odds in the hard and sullen aspect of the morning. But presently the lighter greys of daAvn dispersed the thicker blackness, and throughout the heavens there reigned an air of expectancy, and even the Avaters put on a gentler and a softer appearance. And suddenly there appeared on a spot on the edge of the eastern horizon a blush of pale gold, trem bling in its neAV-born life above the cold Avaters ; and far away up in the sky there shot a reflection of the message, that attracted attention and heralded to all concerned the coming of the day. Then rapidly spread the erubescent light, expanding and brighten ing till, no longer trembling, it lit up the heavens and lapped over the Avaters and made them shimmer like a sheet of fire. And suddenly the sun lifted his red-hot orb above the gloAving horizon."], [313, "XXIV MARIAM 305 A single ray of golden ether shot across the inter vening space, and flashed into Lanxon's eyes as he gazed upon this miracle of splendour. He sat up. On the instant he had regained control of himself. Later in the morning, Avhen in the distance the heights behind Jeddah could already be descried, Ismar spoke to him. \" My friend,\" he said, \" Iioav is it Avith you in respect to Avhat Ave talked about yesterday ? Is it well ? \" \" Nay, Ismar,\" said Lanxon, promptly, \" it is not Avell. There is but one thing that must be said con cerning Avhat you proposed, and that is, it cannot be.\" Ismar gazed at him in profound amazement, though just for a moment a look as if he saw in the far distance some unexpected joy aAvaiting him glimmered in the depths of his eyes. \"What is the meaning of your Avords?\" he said shortly, almost hotly. \" This, my friend,\" merely ansAvered Lanxon : \" that the spirit of the East is one thing and the spirit of the West another. The tAvo cannot mingle any more than oil and Avater. Therefore is the thing that you proposed impossible for me ; because I should have to adopt all your Avays of life, of thought, and of action : and this I could not do. Therefore, for this reason alone, do I again repeat that it cannot be \u2014 it cannot be.\" With these Avords, uttered in a Avay that could leave no doubt as to his determination, Lanxon, Avho was as loth as Ismar himself to touch the core of the question, made as if he Avas about to turn away. X"], [314, "306 MARIAM CHAP. XXIV But a last glance at Ismar's face stayed him. Resentment Avas surely gathering there \u2014 resentment that Avould break out in a moment. Urged by a sudden impulse, Lanxon turned back. \" O Ismar,\" he cried to him, nervously gripping his arm, \" who am I that I should act differently toAvards you ? \" He strode away, leaving Ismar gazing at him in utter helplessness. The last Avords had unmanned him. The anger that had begun to rise at the thought of Lanxon's conduct \u2014 first offering to Mariam his love and then rejecting hers \u2014 vanished. He seemed to see some Avay through the entangle ment of affairs : that Lanxon had acted all along in perfect innocence \u2014 in the spirit of the West \u2014 and had fallen in love in spite of himself and Avithout his OAvn knoAvledge. And Lanxon's sacrifice appeared to him a much greater one than his oavii ; for he kneAV nothing of Lanxon's betrothed. \" Allah alone is Avise,\" he muttered, \" and the voice of Allah is the voice of duty.

From early daAvn the Avork of dismantling and packing had started : tents Avere ruthlessly pulled doAvn, carpets rolled and curtains folded, and finally constrained to assimilate themselves into compact bundles, carefully secured by stout ropes which had been strained around them, with many a rhythmic chorus, by the excited pilgrims, Avho ran about hither and thither, helping each other in that way, or by sitting on bundles to control their movements as theyAvere being secured, or, if nothing else offered, by hoisting themselves on elevated spots and encour- aging their brethren Avith eloquent exhortations and Avell-intoned precepts from the Koran. Now they were at rest, they had completed their preparations, and Avith a holy light of contentment filling their eyes they Avatched the land that they had undergone so much to reach. They shook their heads, and Avagged their beards, and chatted in chorus, scarce anyone listening to his neighbour, but all and every one giving vent in soft-toned voices to the sacred feelings that gently agitated their bosoms."], [316, "308 MARIAM CHAP. As soon as the ship's anchor rattled doAvn into the middle harbour, forty or fifty dhows, or lateen-sailed native boats, came sAvooping around and attempted to secure passengers. But the quarantine flag Avas still flying at the mast-head, and Turkish men-of- Avar's boats coursed round the ship and drove off the dhoAvs Avith much cursing and swearing. Pre sently the doctor's boat with its snow-white sail and Turkish flag above it came rushing along, and as soon as he arrived alongside he gave 'pratique.' Noav Avas the time for the dhoAvs and the black coolies on board of them. Struggling, pushing, and cursing each other and each other's ancestors for the past ten generations, they SAVooped doAvn the side of the Lornadale. The pilgrims lost the calm equanimity Avhich had distinguished them up to this point. In dense bodies they rushed des perately and frantically toAvards the boats.

But virtue brings its own reAvard, and vice versa. The fore most ones, Avho, by temporarily metamorphosing themselves into raging fiends, had succeeded in trampling beneath their feet their Aveaker felloAv pilgrims and with careless violence crashed at every step through some spreading sun-shade or other much-prized article that encumbered the battle ground, found themselves suddenly confronted by a forest of black brawny arms stretched out from a struggling, yelling, almost naked mass of ferocious looking beings beneath them, from which they re-"], [317, "MARIAM XXV 309 coiled Avith a dim suspicion that they had fallen into the hands of the children of Shaitan. But alas ! there remained no hope for them. They had thrust themselves into the van of battle : they could not retreat ; for their trampled brethren gathered them selves up and, unconscious of what Avas in front, pressed them onwards to their fate. The Avhole duty of man, as it Avas at the present moment under stood by each individual black coolie, consisted in his doing his utmost to fill his own boat. They might not have been pitiless creatures by nature. But they had probably Avives and little ones on shore depending on their exertions : the thought of the latter nerved them to deeds of Avhich in soberer moments, no doubt, they Avould have been incapable. Their existence and that of their dear ones depended on the number of passengers they could each secure ; and the struggle for existence in this case resolved itself into a struggle for the possession of the pil grims. The latter ventured to suggest a little more respect for their sacred persons. But the coolies could not afford to listen to their sentiment on the matter, nor to be over-scrupulous as to the Avays and means that offered themselves to their hands for attaining their object. Some contented them selves Avith laying hold of an arm by AA'hich to drag their intended victim on. But to most it appeared to matter little Avhat they made use of \u2014 a beard, a Avaist, a leg, a foot \u2014 so long only that its nature Avas such that they could manage to seize hold of it in some fashion.

If one of them, also, suddenly mani fested an inclination to evacuate his position and proceed to another craft in search of greater com fort, a slight disturbance of the boat's equilibrium at the moment when he was on the point of leaving her Avould send him floundering into the sea, from which the knoAving boatman Avould rescue him humble and penitent, and leave him in dripping Avretchedness to guess at the probable extra charge for the additional service rendered. Of course the pilgrims made much sIioav of resistance with um brellas ; they poured forth oceans of rhetoric and quotations from the Koran ; and they blasphemed not a little : but the black coolies from the African shore remained impervious to all the civilizing in fluences that could be brought to bear on them ; and the poor Hadjis Avere too much Avorn out and be- Avildered Avith their long and arduous journey to offer them any serious resistance. The pilgrims Avho Avere still on deck retreated prudently when they obtained some idea of what lay in Avait for them. But the coolies folloAved them up, and SAvarmed into the ship like so many demons. Their proceedings Avere eminently fitted to strengthen in the pilgrims the conviction \u2014 Avhich no doubt had already begun to haunt them \u2014 that they had come to the land of Avonderful and aAvful things instead of the haven of the rest they had been looking for- Avard to. The din Avas aAvful.

They Avere characterized by the common possession, in addition, of sore throats, and if they had nothing else to do they emitted harsh roars, Avith the obvious intention of increasing the obfuscated state of the pilgrims' minds, so as better to secure their OAvn ends : in other Avords, to obtain possession of their luggage in spite of the possible objections of the OAvners thereof. They flung their ropes around the boxes and industriously tugged them aAvay Avith a sublime indifference to the rights of property and a touch ing reliance on their Kismet to prevent them from being hindered in their laudable endeavours. If ar rested in their course, they came back Avithout a murmur, if it appeared prudent to desist, and with every evidence of heart-felt penitence, to begin again with dogged determination the moment the OAvner's eye was turned aAvay. \" By Allah, this is surely Gehennam ! \" quoth one grave-looking Persian, and he climbed to the summit of his pile of baggage, intending to aAvait in patience the end of the tumult. But alas ! he was not left in peace. Three sets of boatmen attacked him. After much struggling, one set walked off with the coverings of the packages, another Avith the contents, and the third with the pilgrim himself. The ladies of the quarter-deck, hoAvever, sur-"], [320, "MARIAM CHAr. 312 rounded by their Bedouins, remained unmolested. The coolies made tAvo determined efforts to extend to them the sphere of their sympathies : in one they attempted to reach them by means of the deck ; in the other by means of the ship's sides, up which they clambered like so many black monkeys. But in both instances they met with a reception that sufficed to convince them that this party intended to do Avithout them, and moreover \u2014 and this Avas of the greatest importance\u2014 that it Avas capable of maintaining this intention. Ismar chartered a couple of dhoAvs ; and as soon as the hubbub had someAvhat subsided, he embarked his contingent, and conveyed them safely to the shore. All this while Lanxon had been busy Avith many things, which kept him aAvay from the neighbour hood of the quarter-deck. He was agitated by a turmoil of conflicting emotions, some of which pulled him one Avay and some the other. But in action he folloAved blindly the dictates of the spirit of his resolution, and intentionally avoided Ismar and his party. On the other hand, the latter did not go out of his Avay to approach Lanxon ; so that there passed no further Avord betAvixt them. When they had all gone, however, and the decks Avere once more bare and deserted, a reaction fol loAved which ovenvhelmed Lanxon for some mo ments and rendered his mind a blank to all else but the recollection of Mariam.

But it Avas all over : Mariam to him Avas already a thing of the past ; for surely they Avould never again meet in this Avorld. They had come together for a feAv moments, and during these few moments their lives had run together and, in despite of all obstacles, had become bound the one in the other. But it had apparently only been a mere phantasy of Providence \u2014 a cruel phantasy it appeared at this moment to Lanxon. On the other hand, it might have been no phantasy, but a true and beautiful thing floAving from the natural course of things, and only hindered in the realization of its apparent intention by the infusion into it of the highest spirit of the natural order of things \u2014 the sense of duty, Avithout which there Avould be in the natural order of things no harmony, but a frightful chaos. And as this con ception of it dawned on Lanxon's mind, the thought of his love for Mariam became tinged Avith the tran scendent hues of spiritual colouring, which made it surpassingly beautiful, more beautiful than it had ever yet been to his mind : in this light it seemed to add itself to and become an integral part of his OAvn character, lending to it its beauty, and strengthening it by its gentle discipline.

And he hardly felt cause to reproach himself. He had been utterly innocent of premeditated unfaithfulness; what had happened, had happened in some inscru table manner. If it be held a sin for a man to fall in love Avith any Avoman other than the one to Avhom he is bound, the sooner the system of the veil is adopted by all Avomen, the better. In the afternoon Lanxon landed with the captain and Avalked about the bazaars, and called on the agent and various other Europeans. The streets were thronged Avith an excited, noisy, and eagerly gesticulating croAvd.

And then they kissed each"], [323, "MARIAM XXV 315 other on both cheeks, and retired each one Avith Avhat he had yearned for, and filled the air around Avith ejaculations calling doAvn the blessing of Allah on each other's head. In the bazaars Lanxon and the captain met many of their friends, the pilgrims Avho had come over in the Lornadale, \u2014 Avho smiled and laughed in friendly fashion Avhen they saAV them, \u2014 and even ran across the woman in black, the wife of Jusuf Effendi, now arrayed in spotless Avhite, and tearing about in an evident hurry.

Not satisfied Avith this, she suddenly sprang after the donkey, and, Avith a clever movement of her hands, dislodged the load it Avas carrying, and sent it off at a lazy trot by means of a Avell-directed kick ; Avhilst its unfortunate driver sprang up and took to his heels amidst the jeers and laughter of the on-lookers, squatting on their"], [324, "316 MARIAM CHAP.

Ismar was not the sort of man to be turned from his object, once he had made up his mind about it. He therefore dis pensed with any further signs of indignation, and laughed. \" Well, I Avill come Avith you,\" he said. \" But suppose,\" he added, after a moment's pause \u2014 \"sup pose, O Ismar, that I should change my mind about this affair : Avon't you rather regret this thing ? \" Ismar shrugged his shoulders as they turned aAvay together. \" What must be shall be,\" he passively ansAvered. \"Allah alone is Avise.

Down the silent and deserted street they walked, a street loosely lined by uncouth buildings offering no points of attraction externally but the black lattice-work of the windows that jutted out from the walls. Turning a corner, they found another Bedouin in charge of some horses. These the party mounted ; and they rode out of Jeddah and over the salty desert outside towards the mountains that lay beyond, in perfect silence. The scenery of these climes is the scenery of the heavens by night. The day is too hot. Though in"], [328, "MARIAM CHAP. 320 Arabia there are to be found some most beautiful spots, the scenery of the earth by day has never had the same influence on her sons.

They passed the hard and level plain and entered a sandy pass amidst the mountains. Here and there, at great distances, they saAV a solitary cara vanserai for the use of the poorer pilgrims journey ing on this road. And the moon arose, and cast great masses of blue shade across the sand, and also great bands of yellow light. And after they had ridden at a pretty sAvift pace for about tAvo hours, Ismar drew his rein and spoke : \" Hereabouts,\" he said, \" is Avhere the encamp ment should be.\" Then he spoke a feAv Avords to three of the party, and they turned their horses and galloped aAvay in various directions and disappeared amidst the shadoAvs of the mountains. Then one returned and spoke to Ismar, and told him he had found the encampment close by. And Ismar and Lanxon folloAved him, Avhilst the others Avaited for the re turn of their companions. In a valley running out of the main pass they found the encampment. A dozen tents Avere formed in a circle, as is the fashion of the Bedouins when their number is small ; and in the centre there stood one tent, towards Avhich Ismar directed Lanxon to proceed. Lanxon dismounted and strode toAvards"], [329, "XXVI MARIAM 321 it. The folds around the entrance were draAvn apart, and through it streamed the soft moon light: and in this moonlight, awaiting his approach, Lanxon saw a white-robed figure \u2014 the figure of Mariam. Slim and straight, veiled and silent, with the soft ethereal light giving her something of the appear ance of a spirit, she stood there. And as he came closer, Lanxon was struck with the same thought that had come to him Avhen he first met Ismar in Jeddah : that Mariam on her native desert Avas not quite the same person as Mariam on board the Lornadale. Now she was in her element : her pose Avas that of a queen. It Avould be difficult to find anything on earth to surpass in grace the figure of a Bedouin maiden. What suppleness can rival that Avhich is caused by the life of the Desert ; Avhat freedom can compare Avith that Avhich is the very breath of the children of the Desert?

At the farther end, where the moon beams did not penetrate, a single lantern shed a dim light, and by its aid Lanxon could descry tAvo Avhite-veiled figures sitting there, Avhich he guessed to be Ayesha and Im-Abdallah. Lanxon sat him self doAvn and aAvaited the course of events. \" What is this,\" at last said Mariam \u2014 \" Avhat is this that I hear from Ismar Ali ? \" Lanxon paused to reflect. It seemed useless to beat about the bush. \" It means, most noble Mariam,\" he said, \" that I have been dazzled by the graciousness of your Avords, and find myself not Avorthy of them.\" Mariam uttered an exclamation of surprise. \" What Avords are these?\" she said. \" Did I ask you Avhether you thought yourself Avorthy ?

For a moment he was unable to say more ; then Avildly, Avith the energy of desperation, he continued : \" My people are not your people \u2014 \" \" But my people will become yours,\" exclaimed Mariam, impatiently. \"But Avhat is this? Is it now only that you think of these things? By Allah, it is strange. Have you not declared that I am beautiful in your eyes, and constantly given me proofs of your love ? What matter is it, then, if your people are not mine?\" Over Lanxon there SAvept, at her Avords, a sore sense of understanding.

Lanxon shrugged his shoulders, loth to speak : indeed, finding it a matter of exceeding difficulty to utter the words that had to come from his mouth, under the spell of her presence. \" Speak ! \" she repeated Avith greater vehemence. \" Most noble Mariam,\" then said Lanxon, \" my Avords and actions were those of admiration and not of love.

But the Avhirl and fire of Mariam's vehemence caught him and SAvayed him helplessly about, till almost no strength Avas left in him to maintain his resolution. He had almost given Avay \u2014 almost throAvn himself at her"], [333, "XXVI MARIAM 325 feet and cried out for pardon ; but the thought of Ismar suddenly rose with horrible and desperate energy within him, and dammed back the current of passion that impelled him to surrender and ac cept the joys so graciously offered to him. In all this turmoil of conflicting emotions, it was indeed the thought of Ismar and of his behaviour that Avas the backbone of his resolution. For the thought of the past Avas so dim and distant, and his love for Mariam was so real and overpowering, that there existed no equality betwixt them. Nor under ordi nary circumstances Avould he have considered the supplanting of Ismar a very reprehensible matter: though he might have reprimanded it in another. But his consciousness of Ismar's self-effacement had thrown an altogether different light on the matter. It was betwixt himself and Ismar a battle on the point of honour ; and every instinct of honour Avith in him rose up in arms and madly protested against his taking advantage of Ismar's noble conduct. He still remained silent, so that Mariam cried out again. \" Speak ; in the name of Allah and His holy pro phet, speak ! What does this mean ? \" Then Lanxon raised his head, and in a voice low and broken gave utterance to the following words : \" Most noble Mariam, in the name of the Allah Almighty, Ruler of the heavens and earth, listen to my words and believe them. Verily, I had no thought of love when I spoke to you in terms of admiration. Such a thought could not have entered into my mind ; and for this reason : that I am bound to another maiden by love and promises and"], [334, "326 MARIAM CHAP. obligations, according to which our union will take place on my return to my OAvn country. Again I repeat to you that my Avords were only the out come of admiration, and meant nothing further. Such expressions are of common use amongst us ; nor must you attribute to them any intention of insult.\" Mariam gazed at him profoundly. \" Such,\" she murmured, more to herself than to him \u2014 \" such Avere the Avords of my mother, told her by Ismar Ali.\" Then suddenly her face cleared, and a tender light of interest spread over her eyes, and she came and sat doAvn again in her former position. \" By Allah, then, you love another maiden? \" By Allah,\" ansAvered Lanxon, \" I do.\" \" Verily,\" said Mariam, \" it is Avonderful. And you are not married to her, and yet you leave her alone, and come all this long way, and remain all this long time aAvay from her? \" Lanxon smiled. \" Indeed, most noble Mariam,\" he said, \"it is not possible to get married, hoAvever much one may love, Avithout money.\" \" Ah,\" murmured Mariam, \" I remember Ismar saying that is so in your country. And,\" she added, after a short pause, \" does she love you very much ? \" \" I believe so,\" Lanxon ansAvered. \" So that it Avould make her break her heart Avith lamentation if you were to remain with me? \" said Mariam, gazing far aAvay into the moonlight, and pondering deeply."], [335, "XXVI MARIAM 327 Human beings are governed more by the heart than by the head, so that their actions are ofttimes difficult of explanation ; nor did Lanxon attempt to fathom this mood of so impulsive a creature as Mariam. He waited in suspense, dimly conscious that it might at any moment change in character. He hardly dared to look at her, so full of pathos was the fall of her energy, the sadness and softness of her abstracted gaze and fixed countenance. \" Go,\" she suddenly said, abruptly \u2014 \" go. May Allah be Avith you ! Go. May you be happy ! Our things are all tightly roped and stowed aAvay, nor have I anything of value about me, else I should have liked to send her some present. But go \u2014 and Allah be Avith you ! \" As Lanxon rose, Im-Abdallah came forward SAviftly. \" It must needs be so,\" she said. \"But we shall have you in mind, O Hakim ; for we OAve much to you, and words are of little avail. Allah return to you all that you deserve ! With the English in Bag dad and Bussorah the Emir has ever been on the best of terms ; they often come to shoot on his ground. But if in the future one of your nation come to us, he shall, for your sake, be like a brother ; and if he stand in need of anything, all the power of our tribe shall be put forth to secure it. Go \u2014 and Allah be Avith you.\" Mariam was still in the same position as Lanxon passed out ; only Avhen his figure Avas vanishing in the distance did she suddenly spring up and as if intending to pass out herself. But Im-Abdallah laid a hand on her arm. Then the spell broke and Mariam drooped, and sobbed out on her mother's"], [336, "328 MARIAM CHAP. bosom the pangs that seemed at the moment so hard to bear. Lanxon returned to Avhere he had left the horse and the Bedouins Avho had brought him hither. They Avere still there, and so Avas Ismar. No one spoke. Lanxon mounted ; they did the same : and they rode aAvay in silence, back through the pass and on to the plain. Here Ismar dreAv rein. \" I must noAV leave you, friend Lanxon,\" he said in a calm voice. \" These men will accompany you for the rest of your journey. I must return and push omvards Avith the others toAvards Mecca.\" Lanxon turned and grasped the hand that he saAV stretched out toAvards him. \" Here, then, Ave part,\" he said. \" O Ismar, I have been but a cloud ; your light will shine Avith all the greater brilliancy noAV that the cloud is past.\" \" Nay, friend Lanxon,\" said Ismar, smiling gravely, \" my light will be like that of the stars, Avhich does not begin to shine before the sun goes down.\" \"Verily, Ismar,\" returned Lanxon, \"the light of the stars is oft far pleasanter to the sense of man than the fierce burning glare of the sun. Allah be Avith you, O Ismar Ben-Ali ! \" \" Allah be with you, friend Lanxon !\" And Lanxon rode on Avith his followers. And after a Avhile he paused and turned round, and be hold, Ismar Avas still in the same spot, sitting motion less on his horse, and gazing at him deep in thought. But Avhen Lanxon raised his hand as a last farewell, the Arab raised his likeAvise, and Avith a quick gesture turned and galloped aAvay, and passed out of the yellow moonlight into the dark shadoAv beyond."], [337, "MARIAM 329 XXVI And Lanxon returned to Jeddah, and spent the rest of the night at the agent's house, but spoke not a word concerning his adventure. And a feAv days later the Lornadale Aveighed her anchor once more and steamed aAvay on her homeward journey."], [338, "EPILOGUE AND noAv, though not many years have elapsed since these TAventy-one Days, she Avhose part in these pages had been no more than a memory has earned the right to administer lectures both daily and nightly to our friend Christopher Lanxon on the various matters in Avhich he reveals a necessity for correction ; nor does the remembrance of Ma riam, Avith Avhose history she is Avell acquainted, afford her a subject for other than tender reflection. And Ismar, long since united to Mariam, and faraway in the land of Arabia, is folloAving the purpose of his life, concerning which the Avorld may possibly hear more than has Avith diffidence been revealed in this narrative. And if peradventure his name should come to be blazed forth amongst men, to her, though enshrouded from the gaze of publicity, most assured ly will belong much of the spirit of his endeavours. Concerning the rest of these people I have nothing further to say; but though they have passed out of sight, their memory still haunts me, and their voices still seem to sound in my ears.
