The study of the Holy Scriptures had made me deeply feel tlie want of a correct and sufficiently detailed map of the land to which they preeminently call our attention. Among the host of existing maps and atlasses of Palestine I had found none to satisfy this want, even to a tolerable extent. Many of them are filled up with cities and places laid down merely according to fancyr. And although the maps of modern Syria of Berghaus , Col lier. Kiepert &c. have their indisputable merit, yet they are in no wise adequate to what modern Biblical Geography demands. In the course of my naval career it had been my lot to be in charge of the R. Hydrographical Office at Batavia (1839 \u2014 1841). Practical surveying had preceded these duties, and the construction of geographical maps had followed them. Trained as I was by these antecedents, I felt it possible , partly from the labours of others , al ready accomplished, and partly by personal survey, to construct a Map of the Holy Land, which , to a certain degree at least, would satisfy the demands of Biblical science. It laid beyond my power to set off for Syria with the necessary instruments , and , with tbe aid of competent assistants , to make what may be termed a complete triangular survey ; nor was I aware of any individual, who , thrown on his own resources, had ever accom plished such a work. But still a survey of a more superficial cha racter and yet satisfactory for the present times seemed to me pos sible ; and if on the one hand the task I proposed to myself was of great magnitude , I was on the other hand aware that it would be considerably lightened by what had already been done by former tra vellers. From the earliest Geographers down to our days a vast multitude of descriptions of the Holy Land have appeared from the pen of pilgrims of different tongues and nations. Later travellers have van de Velde. Holy Land. J"], [14, "2 followed them in the course of the last fifty years by extensive and valuable researches. Niebuhr. Seetzen, Galiano, several officers ol the English . French and lately also of the United States' Navy had fixed the positions of some of the most important points of Palestine by astronomical observations. During the short time Syria was oc cupied by British power (whilst defending in 1840/41 the Sultan's rights against the invasion of Mehemed Aly), a net of triangles had been made over a great part of the country by the Officers of H. B. M.'s Corps of Engineers ; and although the results of this triangulation were never laid before the public, it was to be hoped that their commu nication would not be withheld by the authorities, were it known how far science would be benefitted thereby. Assisted, therefore, by a vast amount of information gained from travellers , and by the results of so much scientific research , I could hope to succeed in the con struction of a map of Palestine by collecting the partial labours of others and completing them by such a sort of personal survey as cir cumstances would permit me to make. I was much disappointed not to find one or more fellow-travel lers who would join me in this undertaking. Certainly, if there are advantages in being alone in such an expedition , there are also many disadvantages, and if during my journey I never was thwarted by con trariety of opinion, or by the wish of a companion to conduct my re searches in a manner different from my own ; if I was never inconve nienced by the unequal strength , either too much or too little , of a fellow-traveller , I had also never the enjoyment of sharing the im pressions made by the beauties of nature or of rejoicing in the happy independency of eastern travel with a friend whose feelings would be in unison with mine , whilst on the contrary the burthen of the day , which was often very great, weighed upon my shoulders alone. I have throughout my journey felt this isolation to be one of the greatest difficulties attending on it. /Seetzen. Burckhardt and other travellers had to submit to the same. In the beginning of October 1851 I went to Paris, intending to take my route to Syria by the way of Marseilles, Malta and Smyrna. It was then customary for travellers coming from Egypt to remain five days in quarantine at Beirut , whilst those coming from Smyrna were immediately landed without any annoyance of the kind ; and the quarantine station at Beirut being famous for its vermin I was advised, and most prudently , if I had no business at Alexandria, not to touch Egypt, but rather to go by Smyrna to Beirut. \u2014 To see something of the remains of ancient magnificent Egypt , would have greatly delighted me, and to cross the desert into Sj'ria would have given me valuable information for a map of the forty years wanderings of Israel. But this laid for the present beyond my sphere of labour, which was already gigantic enough for my feeble powers , and I could not conscientiously diverge from it by taking the long and round - about"], [15, "3 way of Egypt and the Arabian Desert , however such a tour might otherwise have been interesting. In Paris I provided myself with a telescope , a surveying instru ment, and other necessaries for constructing maps. Except, however, at Sidon , where I was detained by a series of rainy days which gave me leisure for doing so, I was throughout my journey unable to lay down my observations on a chart , time being absolutely wanting. I found that , after the fatigue of the day , it required my utmost exertions to write down every evening in a detailed form the notes which I took in my pocket-book whilst travelling along. I shall give a few more particulars about this in its place. \u2014 In the choice of a surveying instrument I was guided by the character of my intended survey. Chronometers, sextant or theodolite were out of the question, as I had neither time nor intention for astronomical observations, which , moreover . were already to a great extent made by Niebuhr. Seetzen , Gautier , Hell, several officers of the B. R. Navy and lately by the U. S.s' expedition under command of Lieut. Lynch. No doubt, it would have been important to verify their observations, or to in crease their number by new ones ; but this would have required far more time, than I was able to give to my undertaking. The oboussolc d'arpentage\u00bb with two levels , cross-threaded plunging telescope and vertical semicercle with nonius , seemed to me the instrument besl adapted for my purpose , and later experience has proved that in my circumstances it yielded me far more service, than the best theodolite would have done. This will be easily understood by those who are acquainted with the manner in which Eastern villages are built : clusters of houses, all flat-roofed, which, seen from a distance, present no spires or prominent points like the villages in our AVestern Euro pean countries. Sometimes there is a house overtopping the others. and this then forms a fit object, whereon to direct the side of an angle; but very often too the outline ofthe village, seen from afar. presents no conspicuous point whatever , and the observer must then be satisfied with bearing the inaccurate middle of such a place. A theodolite is useful only when the surveyor is properly assisted by fellow-labourers , when staffs or beacons can be placed on the tops of mountains, or on the roofs of houses , and when the angles between these can thus be observed with all the accuracy required for a proper triangulation. But, labouring as I was, without assistants and without being able to put up beacons , often compelled to content myself with the bearing of the middle of a village , a theodolite would in my case have been out of place, and have proved only a most encum bering object on the rough, unbeaten mountain-paths of my wanderings. The value of my instrument laid, therefore, in its simplicity combined with sufficient accuracy. Its compass , of about 7 inches diameter. was divided into half degrees, and even quarter - degrees could be observed with it easily ; but such accuracy was very seldom 1 '"], [16, "4 required' i. In the beginning of my journey I used to observe the vertical as well as the horizontal angle , but finding the former useless for my purpose, I dismounted the vertical semicercle from the instru ment, in order to carry the latter more easily in my saddle-bags. I had neglected to provide myself with Aneroid - barometers. which I afterwards much regretted ; for although there are long lists of altitudes taken by different travellers , yet these measurements present such wide discrepancies , that we should have felt glad for a comparison with observations of our own, in order to be more able to appreciate their respective value. Too many books are, when travelling anywhere , but especially in Palestine, a burthen. Ritter s Erdkunde, vol. XV & XAT (vol. XVII had not appeared at that time) , and Robinson's Biblical Researches I thought, however, indispensable and so they were packed in my porte manteaus with two or three other books on Palestine of secondary rank. From the first official Report of Lieut. Lynch's expedition , a sort of private document (see the Chapter on Altitudes) , I was enabled to make the necessary extracts at the Geographical Society of Paris. These notes assisted me in forming a right judgment of the map, constructed by Midshipman Aulick . which accompanies the said Re port2). Besides these I had with me: Kiepert' s Map of Palestine 1842; Carte de la Syrie meridionale et de la Palestine, dressee en 1835, etc., par C. C alii er , chef dEscadr. au Corps Royal d'Etat Major, d'aprfes ses observations et reconnaissances faites en 1832 \u2014 1833 a l'echelle de 1 : 500,000 ; and a copy of M. F. de Saulcy's Map of the Dead Sea and routes from Nazareth to Nabulus , which he was kind enough to allow me to take from his original pieces. I have elsewhere stated ) the reason why and the purpose for which I took with me a copy of these documents. I regretted much at the time of my departure for Syria not to have succeeded in getting access to the trigonometrical survey made by the officers of the corps of R. Engineers in 1840 and 1841 . as I wanted to lay this survey down as a base to work upon, and to regu late the extent of my own net of triangles according to that made by these officers. But my efforts to obtain the desired documents were fruitless, and I had to go to Palestine and make my survey as well as I could without being guided by the trigonometrical labours of the *) The Rev. S. AVoleott , whose bearings have been of much service in the construction of our map , makes a similar remark on his ohservations. ' .(The \"compass I used\u00bb, he says in Bibl. Sacra 1S43, p. S8 , \u00abwas constructed for staking bearings and traversed finely.

When on my return to England in Sept. 1852 I was more successful, and was kindly allowed by the author ities access to these documents at the Board of Ordnance , I felt that the circumstance of not having had them with me in Palestine, had become an advantage , as it had given to my own survey a perfect in dependent character, and its agreement with the survey of the British Engineers was now a source of much satisfaction. The learned Professor Ritter has expressed his regret1 1, that this survey was never laid before the public. His desire, that it soon might be done, has partly been fulfilled. Major R. Rochfort Scott, Royal Staff-Corps , has constructed from the partial surveys of dif ferent Engineer-Officers a map in three sheets under tlie following title : \u00abMap of Syria, constructed from the surveys and sketches of the un dermentioned officers in that country in 1840 1841, by Major R Rochfort Scott, R.

This Map has been engraved for the Foreign Department by the care of Mr. Arrowsmith. It is not in the trade, but has never theless found its way to the Students of the Geography of Palestine ; and one of the three sheets , the middle one, has been copied and in serted in Colonel Churchill 's ..Mount Lebanon , a ten years' residence from 1842 \u2014 52, describing the manners , customs. &c. ; historical records of the mountain tribes , from personal intercourse with their ehief's &c. 3 vols R. 8V\".

The map was kindly communicated to me when in a yet unfinished state in 1852 by order of the Right Honourable the Earl of Malmesbury , then Secretary of State for the Department of Foreign affairs, and afterwards when it was completed, by order of his successor the Right Honourable tbe Earl of Clarendon. I feel it both my duty and privilege to tender these noblemen my sincere thanks for the kind and important assistance given to my labours by the communication of these maps ; I feel equally obliged to the authorities of the War-Department \u2014 Board of Ordnance \u2014 for the use which I was allowed to make of the original ') See, Erdkunde vol.

J. F. A. Symonds R. E. in 1840/41. This survey extends from 'Akka to the Lake of Tiberias , and from Yafa to the Dead Sea, forming two sections which are united by trian gles from Ras en-Nakura and Safed to Yafa, and the southern environs of Jerusalem. The triangulation is represented in two large sheets bearing the title of : Diagram of the survey of Southern Syria made from June to December 1841 ; and in a partly finished Map constructed from the same, by Lieut. /. F. A. Symonds R. E. , on a scale of half an inch to one mile ; there is also a smaller diagram (same scale) of triangles determining points for the survey of the Bay of 'Akka by Lieuts. Aldrich and Symonds, January 1841 ; Lieut. C. F. Skyring R. E. assisted in surveying the fortifications. The calculation of the triangu lation is given hereafter. The large diagram and map contain a few points which, although laid down by triangulation, are not mentioned in this calculation, nor is the length of the sides of these triangles given in the diagram. I believe that such points are laid down with less correctness than those of which the calculation is given, but they were nevertheless of value in the construction of our map. \u2014 Lieut. Sy monds' work , valuable as it is , was not intended nor fit for publica tion in its original state. On seeing his diagram, we at once felt that these pieces had not been given \"to the public on account of their too fragmentary character, and we cannot but exceedingly regret that the political change in the government of Syria in 1841 has prevented so able an officer from completing his important labours in the Syrian survey. Major Scott has introduced in his map (as is mentioned on its title) the triangulation of Lieut. Symonds, and has so far turned his fragmentary work into account ; but we regret to see that this triangu lation has undergone much modification , and in Major Scott's map is any thing but a faithful copy of the original. We are not acquainted with the documents Major Scott has used in the construction of his map besides those of Lieut. Symonds, but this is very certain, that Maj . Scott's map in no wise corresponds with our own survey , nor with the original diagram of Lieut. Symonds. As we shall in the course of our Memoir have occasion to enter into more particulars about this matter . we now only copy an explanatory note found at the bot tom of the southern sheet of Maj. Scott's map, telling its own tale. ..This sheet is compiled principally from the sketches of Majors Scott ..and Robe. A survey of the country between Acre and Lake Tibe orias, made by Lieut. Symonds R. E., has been embodied, and some ..sketches and reports furnished by Lieut. Col. T. W. O. Mc.Niven. .Lieut. Col. H. D. E. Napier and Major Wilbraham, have also been ..made use of... \u2014 Had Lieut. Symonds triangulation been the principal piece in this compilation, and had all the other documents been em bodied in it. instead of vice versa, the former would not have been mu tilated and the value of the latter would have gained much by being embodied."], [19, "7 Whilst mentioning these documents, it may be here the proper place to enumerate also the other books , maps, manuscripts, &c, which have been used in the construction of our map. We do not intend to furnish a catalogue of works on Palestine , so as to give a correct idea of the long series of authors, who have devoted their time and talents to this subject. Readers, who desire such information, we must refer to Reland, von Raumer, Robinson, Ritter, and especially to Dr. T. Tobler. We shall only mention the works which have been more immediately useful to our object. In doing so, we wish thankfully to acknowledge the assistance received from the University \u2014 and Ad vocates library of Edinburgh , the Libraries of the Universities of Utrecht and Leyden, and the Bibliotheque Imperiale de Paris, to whose treasures every access was kindly given.

The title of the map is: ..Carte topographique de l'Egypte et de plusieurs parties des pays limitrophes ; levee pendant l'expedition de l'armee franchise, par les ingenieurs - geographes etc., construite par M.

XVII (Paris 1824) ; of the Description de l'Egypte Professor Beryhaus in his excellent Memoir on his map of Syria gives a short but clear and compre hensive analysis of this map , from which we insert the following extract. Jacotin's map includes Palestine from Sur (Tyre) and the southern border of el-Huleh to Gaza, or even the borders of Egypt. It is constructed on a scale of 1 : 100,000. Jacotin. himself Engineer - officer of Napoleon's staff, was assisted by Ch. Paultre, Artillery- officer , Aide de Camp of General Kleber. and author of a <. Carte physique et politique de la Syrie , pour servir a l'histoire des conquetes du general Bonaparte en Orient. Paris 1S03\u00bb. The measurements were made partly with an Astrolabium. and partly with a mere boussole when on military reconnoitrings. The whole map covers an area of 1534/s german geographical \u25a1 miles, 92 of which were surveyed by regular triangulation ' | . To the latter belong the environs of Yafa within 3000 metres from the city, and a part of lower Galilee. The road from Gaza to Yafa and Ramleh was determined by compass and distances. General Junot's route from the village of Mesky (Miskeh . now a ruin on the Nahr el-Hadhar to the southern base of M' Carmel is laid down by Horace Say and tbe country of Sufi.

The documents relative to the map do not prove it by facts and figures, and if there had been indeed a proper triangulation made , there could not have been such a wide discrepancy with the. one made by Lieut. Symonds, and with all other subsequent, although more superficial, surveys."], [27, "15 Kishon as far as el-Kireh, and the routes from Akka to el-Kireh. Shefa 'Amar, 'Abilin, Bedawiyeh, Sefurieh, Nazareth. Kana (Kefr- Kenna) and the Khan N. E. of M' Tabor. The latter and Jebel Duhy, Kefr Menda &c., are connected with these triangles. From M' Tabor Jacotin went to the Jisr Madjama (Mejami'a), fixed the position of Beisan and the course of the Jordan opposite it till the sea of Galilee , as also the course of the river Yarmuk to a distance of 5'/> miles from its junction with the Jordan : Tu bariyeh, Kurn Hattin and Lubieh were visited next. Some of the routes which lead through the Plain of Esdraelon to 'Akka were laid down by other Engineer-officers. The country from Jenin to Nabulus is drawn according to the information obtained from Yakub Habib of Shefa 'Amar. The westcoast of the sea of Galilee and the country between it . the Jisr Benat Yakub and Safed, were surveyed by Paultre; the road from 'Akka via Rameh to Safed by Lieut. Vernois; and the road from Ra.sen-Naku.ra to Tyre by General Vial. Such a list of authorities was truly calculated to inspire con fidence, and this must serve as an explanation, why Jacotin's map has for a number of years remained the base upon which a host of maps of Palestine have been constructed, although the astrono mical observations of Gautier, Hell, Niebuhr, Seetzen and others. as well as the less scientific but still in its way very valuable infor mation of various travellers , had long ago proved the reputation of excellency which this map enjoyed to be usurped. Moreover Jacotin's map is engraved with such an amount of topographical detail , and on so large a scale , as to impart the belief that all this is a correct copy of nature , whilst it is for the greatest part the mere fancy-work of the draftsman. We desire to appreciate the labour of Jacotin and his fellow-officers employed in this survey. as accompbshed with zeal under the unfavourable circumstances of war, but we desire equally to set forth the value of his map in its true light , especially with reference to the state of progress which science has made in our days , and we want to guard the public against all such kind of fancy -detail as has been inserted in a work proceeding from the highest authorities. As a beautiful contrast to Jacotin's map stands, in this respect, the above noticed map of Collier, who left in bianco all such parts as were not visited by him or insufficiently made known by those travellers whose itineraries he introduced. We cannot but regret with Ritter (XV, 88) the absence of an accompanying Memoir to this excel lent document. Prof. H. Berghaus well known (Karte von Syrien*. with ..Geogra- phisches Memoir zur Erklarung etc.\u00bb (n\u00b0. 5 of Berghaus Atlas von Asien , Gotha 1835) has opened, as Ritter well remarks Erdkunde XV. 84). a new era in the cartography of Palestine"], [28, "16 and his Memoir may be called a model for those who devote their talents to the construction of maps. An analysis so able and bespeaking so much conscientiousness is rarely met with. The proper geographical investigation of Palestine has , as it were. only begun since Berghaus' map. In the present days, of course, this work has been left far behind ; but its comparative merit has thereby not decreased . and it will at all times remain a monument of indefatigable zeal and extraordinary discernment . \u2014 ..Fantasie- Zeichnungn, says Ritter ' | and we corroborate fully this testimony, \u2014 ..war bei der Sparsamkeit der Fix- und Durchschnittspunkte ..aus den vorhandenen Daten fur viele Landesgegenden noch nicht ..zu vermeiden ; aber die Griindlichkeit der Durchfuhrung der gan ..zen Karte hat ihr den grossen AArerth verliehen. dass ihreBerich itigung eben dadurch mit der Zeit moglich wurde , was bei der ..haufigst so oberflachlichen, unkritischen Behandlung des geogra ..phischen Materials von unzahligen Kartenfabrikanten gar nicht ein i.mal moglich ist. \u00bb In noticing the want of astronomically fixed coast -points in Jacotin's map Ritter2) mentions and hopes for the publication of the coast -survey of Palestine, made in 1840 and 1841 by Major Scott and Lieut. Symonds. Their survey (as Major Scott's map shows) has certainly corrected the fancy-bays and other errors of the french Engineer's map , but without determining any point by astronomical observation. We were informed in 1856 by Cap tain Washington R. N.. now in charge of the Royal Hydro graphical Department in London, that some of H. M.'s men of-war in the Mediterranean were under command of surveying the Syrian coast ; and the communication of their labours was kindly promised to us. We regret to say that up to this time, whilst our Memoir is going to the press , no communication of that kind has reached us. AVe mention, however, the hydro graphical maps made of the Roads of Tripolis , \u2022 Beirut , Saida. Tyre, 'Akka, Haifa and Yafa by the officers of H. M.'s Navy and containing astronomical positions. The ports of Tyre and Saida were surveyed in 1831 and 1833 by H. A. Ormsby R. N. ; that of Haifa in 1832 by /. Aylen, master of H.

From an expedition so well organized, some thiiig more accurate and less sketchy might have been expected ; and such serious errors , as those which occur in this map, are doubly to be regretted, when a work bears the official stamp1 . We believe that, had Lieut. Dale been spared to construct his own materials into a Map of Syria and Palestine, something better and more in accordance with the noble expedition would have been the result. A few notes and sketches of routes, followed by part of the expedition, were left after M. Dale's death atBhamdun (1848) in the hands of Dr. E. Smith , who kindly communicated them to us. They contain routes from Hasbeiya, along the Nahr Hasbany to Lake Tiberias, and routes from Tantura to Yafa. A manuscript map bearing the title of La Baronie de Saiede et de Beaufort, Cesaire et Besain (Besitzungen des deutschen Or dens in Libanon), by the late Dr. E. G. Schultz, 1850, accom panied with notes , was kindly lent us for inspection by Professor Ritter. We beg him to accept our sincerest thanks for this proof of interest in our labours. The map is valuable for its references to the Crusaders' possessions in this territory , but it is a mere sketch without any approach to geographical accuracy. We owe to Dr. Schultz the first thorough exploration of Galilee. He visited it in many places, where no European traveller had been for cen turies past, and we only regret that during his excursions in this as well as other parts of the land (mostly taken in 1845 \u2014 47), he took no measurements, from which it would have been possible to construct a correct map2). To this circumstance we must also ') See on these errors also Porter, Eive years in Damascus, &c. I, 297. 2) Schultz's travels (from a M. S. letter to Prof. C.

Porter of Damascus I am obliged for a copy of a map of the country South of that capital as far as Bostra (the ancient Bozrah), drawn up by Fezzy Beg, Colonel of Turkish Engineers , formerly in the Hungarian service. Col. Fezzy Beg constructed it while on official duty in the Ha'uran ; but Mr. Porter informed me that, on using this map in loco, he found it to be chiefly a copy of Berghaus' map of Syria 1835, containing only here and there some useful corrections and addi- tions. J. L. Porter's Map of Damascus, Ha'uran and the Lebanon mountains, from a personal survey 1850 \u2014 1855, forms part of his \u00abFive years in Damascus, &c.\u00bb A memoir relating to the history of its construction during different travels and excursions, was read before the R.

Mr. Porter informs us in this document that he began his Map in 1 850 by constructing the course of the Barada river , taking bearings with a large compass, and noting down the travelled distances from his itineraries , whilst the elevations were measured by aneroid-barometer. The AVady of Helbon and the surrounding mountainous country were next examined. In the autumn of 1852 Mount Hermon was ascended, and the three I. In Oct. 1845 from Beirut to Jerusalem. Rapid journey.

The angles were taken. on this occasion, by compass and pocket sextant. On a later tour, part of Antilebanon was explored to the N.E. of AVady Helbon in, eluding the Eastern highway from Damascus to Horns. The lower parts of the rivers Barada and Awaj and their outlet in the three lakes to the E. of Damascus were successively laid down. Next followed a tour to the Lejah and Ha'uran mountains, on which occasion the author was very nearly killed by the fanatical Muslems of Edhr'a. Many of his observations were lost in this encounter. \u00abI thus traversed, says Mr. Porter, the whole region ..between the Haj or Pilgrim-road and the borders of the desert in ..such a way as to enable me to cover it with a network of bearings, .embracing all the more important towns and villages. And these ..I connected with the well-defined summits of Hermon and Mani' a ..and afterwards with several places in the plain of Damascus, from ..which I took bearings of the Kuleib and Tell Khalediyeho '). On a subsequent journey from Bludan to Beirut by Zahleh and back again by the Cedars and Ba'albek \u00aba series of triangles were run ..up the great valley of the Buka'a as far as Baalbek*. ; and during another journey to Horns he carried his survey round the northern extremity of Antilebanon , visiting the fountain of the Orontes near Hurmul and returning to Damascus by Nebk and Maliila. In constructing his map Mr. Porter first endeavoured to fix the true positions of Damascus and Ba'albek. ..In doing so, I had\u00bb, he says. \u00abno very satisfactory data on which to work . since I was ..obliged to correct their positions, as assumed by the best author cities, in order to make them agree with my own observations. ..Having laid down these places , I constructed the several routes ..I had followed between them, and thus fixed with care the station .on the summit of the lofty peak above Bludan. 1 then laid down \u00abthe stations of observation on Hermon , Jebel Tiniyeh , Tell aMania and Tell es-Salahiyeh , from each of which , with ihe (.exception of the second , / had taken the angles of all the others. ..On the bases thus formed, I constructed the whole map from my \"itineraries, and very* numerous bearings. It will thus be observed, .(that the map has no claim to strict accuracy, as there were no ..points within the bounds of my surrey astronomically fixed to aserve as basis. I have endeavoured , however , to approximate as ..closely to the truth as possible ; and I have been careful to de olineate with accuracy the relative positions of the several provinces, \"cities, and villages'.2). ') Journal of the R. Geogr. Soc. vol. XXArI. p. 53 ') ibid. p. 55. 9*"], [32, "20 Science is indeed greatly indebted ioMr. Porter for his geographic al labours. That part of the country, surveyed by him, was veiy inac curately and in some places not at all known. His visit to the Lejah nearly cost him his life. Anxious, however, as we are to appreciate his zealous explorations, we cannot but regret the scanty manner in which they have been reproduced in tbe little map which accompanies his \u00abFive years in Damascus*). It is impossible to read his interesting descriptions of the Barada valley , of the wild gorge of Helbon, of the convent crowned cliffs of Saidnaya , Jubb Adin and Malula, or of the sublime gorge intersecting the ridge near Ras el-' Ain (Yabrud, vol. I, 359), without regretting that all the topographical details mentioned in the text are wanting on the map, partly because its scale is too small, and partly because of the unsatisfactory manner, in which Mr. Porter's draftsman has treated the mountain shading. In our days the art of Map-drawing has made too much progress to allow so little attention being paid on this important part of a valuable survey. \u00abA glance at the map accompanying this work.), says Mr. Porter, ..will suffice to show what a transformation the face of the country uhas undergone even since Berghaus' Map was published1).). And well is the author justified in pointing at the great contributions which he gave to the geographical knowledge of large districts which hitherto had been almost a terra incognita ; but for this very reason we feel it a great pity, that the topographical representation of these districts should have been thus neglected. What we lament still more, is an error which was strangely made in applying the ATariation of the compass in the wrong sense, i. e. as if it had been E. instead of AV. Mr. Porter has adopted the variation to be 10\u00b0W.2); but his angles are corrected indeed for 10\u00b0 E. Now , the most correct calculation of the Variation at present is 8\u00b0 1 5 AV. ; consequently the error in Mr. Porter's angles laid dow*n in his map is 18\u00b0 15'. The relative positions of Damascus , Ba'albek, Hums, and in fact the whole map, has thereby become singularly distorted. Mr. Porter has noticed the difference between the position of some of the principal places in his map and the maps of others, for he draws the reader's attention to it : \"This region (Ba'albek to Beliidan), though traversed during the last ocentury by hundreds of travellers, has never been correctly described ((or delineated upon maps. My numerous bearings and minute ob \u00abservations, connected with carefully kept itineraries, have enabled me <>to construct the accompanying map in the accuracy of which I feel ..confident &c.\u00bb, and again : \u00abit is this strange errors (the plain of Zebedany being represented by others as running due N. , and by some as N. byAV.). ..which has tended so much to misplace Ba'albek and the whole ..ridge of Antilebanus on all previous maps\u00bb (Five years &c. vol.

But unfortunately the great difference here referred to by Mr. Porter is chiefly the result, of his mistake in the application of the Variation. Mistakes occur , however , even to the ablest, and Mr. Porter's full descriptions of regions hitherto unex plored, his discoveries of the great, lines of Roman roads and some an cient sites , his corrections of errors by Burckhardt and others , and especially his historico-geographical sketch of the Kingdom of Bashan and its provinces, ought in no wise to be depreciated because of his blunder in the construction of his map. These researches and com munications have a high value independent of the cartography, and in another edition of his most interesting volumes the author will, no doubt, benefit the public with a corrected and improved map. Those who , in the meanwhile, wish to profit by his angles as he measured them originally , as we also have done whilst using his map , will find some of such bearings in vol.

II. ANALYSIS. In the foregoing chapter we have briefly and in a general way noticed the means and materials which served us in the construction of our Map. In a subsequent chapter we give a short sketch of our Itinerary including our measured angles. The calculation of Lieut. Symonds' triangulation will be found under another head. Our list of Routes and Distances shows how and where the researches of other travellers have been interwoven with those of our own. We now proceed to enter into some particulars of the mode in which our Map was con structed. In the extent of land, represented on the Map, we were guided by the consideration of what might be properly said to constitute the Holy ') Vol. II, 364, 305."], [34, "22 Land. i. e. the country bounded on the South by the (.River of Egypt\" the AVady el-Arishl, and extending as far N. as the northern end of the two Lebanons ; with the Mediterranean sea and the Arabian de sert for its boundaries to the AV. and E. True, by adding a few inches to the length and breadth of the Map, the northern and south western limits of the Land of Israel might have been more fully shown : but we had also to consider the size of the Map, which ought not to be too small, so as not to admit of a proper detail , and neither too great, so as to become awkward and difficult in its use. Besides the coastline fromRafiahto el- Arish and the extreme northern base of Le banon, down to the Nahr el-Kebir (the river Eleutherus) could only have been introduced from imperfect materials, to which we had nothing to add bv researches of our own. We. therefore, fixed upon a scale of 1:315,000 as seeming best to answer the above requisites. For con venience the Map has been divided into 8 sheets , which will allow of its being pasted together on linen when required. The triangulation of Lieut. Symonds. as was already stated, has been the base upon which we have worked our own triangles. How ever, an astronomically fired point being wanting on that document, we have selected 'Akka as the one which seems the most to be relied upon of all. As a mean from Niebuhr, Gauttier, Hell and Dillon1), we have adopted the latitude of'Akka (the castle) to be 32\u00b0 55' 16\". The longitude of 'Akka from the Admiraby-map, 35\u00b0 8 E. of Greenwich, we rejected, as having no warrant for its accuracy, and as showing too great discrepancy with the results of observations taken in 1816 and 1817 by Capt \" Gauttier and Hell, French R. N. 2) These obser vations give for the house ofthe French Consul at 'Akka 21' 10' 56\" in time, or 32\u00b0 41 in arc, longitude E. of Paris, or 35\u00b0 4 15 ' E. of Greenwich. The citadel lies a little more to the E. and I have conse quently adopted for its longitude 35\u00b0 4' 30.\" Berghaus, Lynch and Callier agree as nearly as possible with these figures. Major Scott's map has 35\u00b0 3' 20\". AATth 'Akka's latitude and longitude thus fixed, and applying a cor rection of 8\u00b0 15' AV. on the magnetic North line in Lieut. Symonds\" diagram , we now found the country between Ras en-Nakura and the Northern end of the Dead Sea at once framed in the net of his trian gles upon the accuracy of which we could fully rely. The latitudes and longitudes of Jerusalem, Yafa and other important places were thus at the same time fixed by this triangulation; and in the accuracy of these positions we felt all the more confidence on comparing them with the ') From the Map published by the Admiralty in 1844 : Bay of Acre by G. Biddlecombe, master of II. M. S. Talbot, 1810, and C. H. Dillon of II. M. S. Vernon, 1843. 2) Connaissance des Temps 1S2I and 1832. See Berghaus' Memoir tor a detailed account of the observations made by these officers."], [35, "23 latitudes and longitudes obtamed by others by astronomical observa tions. In the northern and southern sections of our Map, beyond the limits of Lieut. Symonds' triangulation, we had the astronomical obser vations of Niebuhr ') , Seetzen, Gauttier and Hell, Moore, and espe cially those of the U. S.s' expedition under Lieut. Lynch , to guide and control our own measured angles. A comparative table of latitudes and longitudes wdl be joined hereafter , in which we briefly notice, what we now on this sub ject omit. Having first constructed our triangulation sheet without taking into account the spherical form of the earth, we then contracted it for a conical projection, according to AV. Hughes' rule in his \"Principles of Mathematical Geography, London 1S43\u00bb. Lieut. Symonds' diagram on a scale of half an inch to one mile was, previous to its insertion, re duced to the scale adopted by us ; and the latter underwent no change since it was first laid down in order that all chances of inaccuracy by multiplied reductions might be avoided. In fixing our scale for travelling hours at the average rate of 2% Geogr. mile per hour with horses and mules, we give the result of our own experience. Berghaus' Memoir assumes a somewhat smaller rate, based with great clearness upon the travelled distances of Maun drell, Burckhardt, Parthey and Buckingham. But the routes of these travellers were taken over the most difficult mountain-paths of the country, and there indeed the average cannot be estimated above 2 mdes an hour. His estimation, however, of 2,30 Geogr. miles an hour for the plains ithe mean from 10 itineraries) is too small2). Great allowance must be made for the mode of travelling with or without the generally slow following baggage -mules in calculating the pace of one's horse. So, for instance , we found Drs. Eli Smith and Robinson, on our excursion to Pella and Beisan, travelling at a much faster rate than we ourselves were wont to do. The same increase of speed in their travels may be noticed on comparing the itinerary of the Biblical Researches with that of the Later Bibl. Res.3) ; whilst the second part of Dr. Robinson's last journey, when ') In C. Niebuhr's Reisebeschreibung nach Arabien, &c, Hamburg 1837, HI. Band, p. 229, are added J. Olshausen's Anmerkungen to his astronomical observations; and a quotation is there given from von Zach's amonatlicher Correspondenzo , IV S. , 240, showing that Niebuhr's lunar distances are re markably correct. For instance, the longitude of Alexandria which he deter mined (1701) by a series of 9 {[ distances taken during 5 days, corresponds per fectly with the longitude found by the French in later years by chronometers and star-eclipses, observed with superior instruments. z) E. Robinson estimates the average \"rate of travelling with horses at 2,4 Geogr. miles per hour. In the plains he extends the length ofthe hour to 2,8 or even 3 Geogr. miles. Bibl. Res.

G*> 45'."], [36, "24 he was accompanied by Mr. Thomson or other Missionaries, shows again the more ordinary rate of 2% mile per hour. Burckhardt's travels shew the same unavoidable variation of speed, and so do those of others. Porter's distances are in general travelled over at a faster rate than usual. M. Thrupp's notes assume a difference of 25 per cent in the speed of his travels when accompanied by his baggage-mules or not. All such particulars we have brought into account in the construction of our Map and in the accompanying list of Routes and Distances. The figures of the latter are given according to the average rate of travel ling as here stated. The Variation, for which we corrected all the angles used in the construction of our Map, was assumed to be 8\u00b015'AV., from the Ad miralty-maps of the roads of Beirut, 'Akka and Yafa. At Tripolis M. Dillon found the variation in 1843 to be 8\u00b0 10' W. The Variation along the coasts of Egypt and Syria seems to be now decreasing. Dur ing Bonaparte's expedition (1799) it was found to be at Alexandria 13\u00b0 6 AAr. and along the Syrian coast from Gaza to 'Akka 13\u00b0 20 . Capt. Hell found the variation in 1816 at Alexandria 9\u00b0 28' and be tween Yafa and'Akka8\" 44'. On the depressed Lake of Tiberias Lieut. Lynch observed the Variation to be 8\u00b0 42 : strange it seems, that ne vertheless it is remarked in the preface to the Official Report, p. 77 : \"The bearings are magnetic and have not been reduced for variation ..which may be taken approximately as 10\u00b0 AV. \u00bb 1) In the Orthography of Arabic names with English characters we have followed the system adopted by Dr. Eli Smith (see II Appendix of the Bibl. Res.) as that of the highest authority; not, however. without finding the pronunciation of these nanies, as we heard it, some times greatly to differ from the manner in which they are written in E. Smith's \u00abList of Arabic names \u00bb. Nor can we pass by unnoticed that these names are not always spelt by the learned scholar in the same manner , and that it is consequently impossible rigorously to fol low a system which is inconsistent with itself. So , for instance, we find Anabeta, (II App. p. 129); Ukhneifis , Semunieh , Jebata (ibid. p. 132); Liba'ah, Kefr Jerra, Kerkha (ibid. p. 187), from the Bibl. Researches written: 'Anebta, Khuneifis, Semmunieh, Jebatha, Lib'ah, Kefr Jerrah, Kerkhah in the Later Bibl. Res. \u2014 The spelling in the Map and text of the latter volume is also not always corresponding : amongst others we find Tell Kaimon, Tell el-Mutsellim, (p. 113) Um ') The bearings here referred to are found in Dr. Anderson's Report. Little can be said in their praise. AVe have found them either to differ too much from those observed by AVoleott and ourselves, as on the Dead Sea coasts, or given in too vague a manner, as in the valley of the Jordan. In making this remark, however, we wish in no way to throw a shadow upon the excellency of Dr. Anderson's Report, which lies in its most valuable contribution to the geological formation of Palestine,"], [37, "25 ez-Zenat, (p. 114) Khuldeh , (p. 151) Kiilonia , (p. 158) Jaura, (p. 271) el-Burak, Bereikut, (p. 274) Nuhhalin, (p. 284) , Erhah, (p. 287) Deir Jervir, (p. 290) AV.

In most cases, where we find Robinson & Smith's manner of spell ing to differ from the words as we heard them pronounced ourselves, or as we found them given by other travellers whose authority should not be rejected, we have in this Memoir given the different ways of writing such names1). In addition to the modern names we have also given the ancient appellations, chiefly those of Biblical interest. Incases, however, where the identity was more or less doubtful, or where the Map would have been too crowded by the addition of ancient names, we have not in serted them. The last chapter of this Memoir is consecrated to a gene ral list of ancient names arranged alphabetically, and containing , in a summary manner , all the information we have been able to collect on this important subject. The degree of certitude of identification is at the same time therein set forth. On the Map the ancient names are put in brackets, as el-Khulil (Hebron), Teku'a (Tekoa), &c. The names of peculiarly distinguished inhabitants , when being the chief occupants of certain portions ofthe land, such as the Druzes and Maronites in Mount Lebanon , the Arab tribes inhabiting other sections of Palestine, are marked by a thin letter, such as: Jehalin, Dhullani, &c. 2) Here and there the words not examined will be found on the Map.

See Bibl. Res. III. App. I , p. 38,"], [38, "26 indicating that we had no opportunity of either visiting such places, or obtaining sufficiently correct information about them from others. The political division oj' the country into Provinces and Districts is interwoven with such doubts and uncertainties that , after fruitless attempts to obtain satisfactory information in loco , and efforts as fruitless by subsequent correspondence , we have been obliged to give up the attempt of representing this division on our Map , introducing merely the names of Provinces. Districts and Sub-Districts , such as they occur in Dr. Smith's list {Bibl. Researches), without determination of their boundaries. In order that the difficulties of a representation of the Political division might be understood, we insert here an extract of a letter, from the Rev. AV. M. Thomson, to whom, as taking a real interest in these matters (and who, by an experience of more than 20 years, knows the country perhaps better than any other foreign resident in Palestine:, I had applied for assistance on this point : \u00abI immediately set to work\u00bb, so he writes from Sidon 31. January 1850, (.to collect the information which you requested in relation to the political di- vision of this country. \u2014 I wrote to Jerusalem and received a prompt reply, ..that there was no source of information there which could enable them to ..state the divisions of theirownneighbourhood. Imyselfsaw one who questioned (.closely the best informed persons from 'Akka, Tyre, Hasbeiya, &c, but am osorry to say, that I could make nothing out of their conflicting and confused ((accounts. Mr. B. applied to the highest authority in the country, at Beiriit, ..and finds it quite impossible to obtain any reliable information. The govern- ..ment itself does not know the limits of the various districts into which the ..country is divided. This day I received a long letter from Dr. M. of Damascus ..to whom I had written on the subject. You know him, and know also that, if \u00abhe could not give the political divisions of thatPashalie, it is idle to hope for ..them from any other quarter. But his letter is wholly taken up with a state- \u00abmeiit of the obstacles and difficulties, and sums up the whole by saying ((that it would take years to collect the information. \u2014 My own opinion is, \"that no person could draw the limits of any district from any information' ..which he could collect either from the books of Government, or from the ..most intelligent natives. The information could not be used unless you were ..on the ground, visited each district for the purpose, and drew your boun- (( claries on the spot. This, of course, would be an immense labour, and the \"benefits would not repay the expense. Many of the districts are small, and (\u2022there are constant changes made in the limits by adding to or substracting ..from them according to the exigencies of the Government, or the favouritism ..manifested towards those who pay well for favours. Your District-division?, ..therefore, for this year would not be exact for the next. Even in the largest \"of all divisions there are great changes made almost every year. The whole ..region covered by your map is now included in the two \"pashalics of Beiriit ..and Damascus. The boundary between them is the Dead Sea, the Jordan and \"the Hasbany up to the Khan of Hasbeiya. It then turns west to Jisr Bur\u00ab-huz (.ou the Litany, and keeps up the ridge of Lebanon west ofthe Litany, throwing \"Mushgarah and all villages on tlie eastern slope of Lebanon into the district \u00abol the Buka'ah, which belongs to Damascus, except Zahleh, which is attached <.to Lebanon From Hurmiil at the N. E. end of Lebanon the line runs along \"tlie Jebel Akkar and the Ansairiyeh mountains, giving the territories of \u25a0.Hums and Hamah to Damascus. - This is a great change. Formerly most of"], [39, "27 \"Palestine belonged to Damascus. It now all belongs to Beirut , or, as it is \"improperly called, the Pashalic of Sidon by those who are fond of adhering \"to old names..) The statements of this letter perfectly correspond with a letter. which I received from the highest authorities at Constantinople in answer to an application made for information about the official division and subdivision of Syria. From this answer I could know nothing further, than that Syria is divided into four great Pashalics , two of which, Beirut, & Damascus, only fall under our present consideration. The natural division of the country by the great depression valley of the Jordan with its three lakes , Merom , Gennesareth and the Dead Sea. and further north by the high dorsal ridge of Lebanon, seems to have suggested the partition into these two Governments. That of Beirut is again divided into five great provinces : the Pashalics of Jerusalem, Akka and Sidon, and the Kaimakamats of Tripolis and Ladakiyeh (or Latakiyeh). Under the Pashalic of Sidon resort the middle and southern sections of Mount Lebanon, divided into two parts, which are governed by two Kaimakams , one being the Chief Emir of the Druzes , residing at Shuweifat , the other the Emir Beshir of the Christian population residing at Brummana. The justicial affairs of Mount Lebanon are brought before the tribunals of these two princes, each composed of five Druze-members, five Christians and two Turks. Deir el-Kamar has kept an independent positition and resorts di rectly under the Government of Beirut, which is there represented by a Kaimakam ; he is president of a tribunal composed of the elders of the town. [) The ancient division into the portions assigned to the twelve Tribes of Israel has not been introduced into our Map , as being too imper fectly known. Moreover, the limits of these Tribes have in the course of ages long passed frequently changed , and it would thus , even if they were known, be impossible to mark them all on the Map. 2) In our Itinerary and in the chapters on Routes and Distances we have intentionally been particular in mentioning those parts of the country, which make an exception upon the general barrenness , for which Palestine is remarkable. It so happens, that the old beaten pilgrim - routes lead through the rockiest and bleakest parts of the *) Col. Churchill (Mount Lebanon &c.) mentions a division of Lebanon into 2 1 districts, the names of which he gives only in part. E. Robinson (E. Smith's list) has 19 districts; H. Guys (in Ritter XVII, 097, 098) 24; E. G. Schultz (ib. p. 700, 745), who got his information from the Emir Beshir Haidar, enu merates 13 Druze districts and 7 of tlie Maronites. Schultz has added at the same time a valuable list of villages and convents, supplementary toE. Smith's list. These have been introduced in our Map , so far as we had their positions confirmed from other sources. '-) The same feeling was expressed by M. Isambert in : Rapport sur les voyages de M. M.

The fertility of Palestine is, as has. been often observed , even at this hour very remarkable. Russegger3), a high authority as geologist, says that Syria belongs to the most fertile lands of the earth, especial ly the plains along the coast from Gaza to Beirut, those of Esdrae lon, the Ha'uran, Ladakiyeh etc. \u2014 Dr. Anderson's geological Re port also refers frequently to the wonderful productiveness of this land. Unfortunately, however, regions of the highest fertility from various causes remain fallow4), and the traveller passes over contiguous leagues of the richest soil, which is wholly unproductive to men. The Sultan's revenue of all Syria including Aleppo is estimated by Dr. Bowring5) at \u00a3312, 500, >(which.>, he adds, \u00abis less than a ((seventh of what it yielded in tribute unto Egypt, long after the pro cphecies were sealed..) We possess no documents from which it would be possible to draw up a statistical account of the population of Syria , of its taxes, industry, agriculture and commerce. But fragmentary information of that kind may be found in the before-mentioned Official Report by Dr. Bowring; in Ritter' s Erdkunde, XVI, p. 81 7 \u2014 834, on the Pash alic of Jerusalem ; in Lynch's Official Report on the imports and exports of Beirut and Yafa; in Poole' s Report of a Journey in Pa lestine (Journal Geogr. Society, London vol. XXATI, p. 55) on Yafa ; and in Robinson's Lat. Bibl. Res. p. 628 \u2014 630 on the Province of 'Akka. For details on these subjects we must limit ourselves to the reference here given. AAre close these general remarks by noticing the Climate. \u2014 A country riven by volcanic action throughout its length with a wide val ley gradually deepening to 1300 feet below the level of the ocean, and filled in other parts with mountain-ridges bearing tops of 10,000 feet height, which nearly all the year round are covered with snow, must, of course, present a variety of climates differing according to the influ ences of such mighty agents. Indeed Syria possesses at the same time the glorious , bracing and moderate , in some places even cool climate of the Alps of Switserland and Savoy ; the warmer , but yet beautiful and pure air of Italy ; and the hot oppressive temperature of the Tro- \") Ex.

The scourching and suffocating hamzin or sirocco from the Arabian desert is often seriously felt and particularly in the plains. though even at an elevation of 2000 and 3000 feet its enervating in fluence cannot altogether be escaped. Crowded villages , and more so towns , particularly those on the coast, are during the hot months of summer subject to fever , to which the filthiness of the people is certainly contributary. But, on the whole, we believe the climate to be healthy , and of this the robust make and constitutions of its inhabitants are the best proof. Europeans should avoid, if possible, during the summer-months, a residence on the coast or in the plains. They will find always a healthy refuge in the mountains , and where a residence in Lebanon can be obtained between 5000 and 7000 feet, the climate will be found as healthy and invigorating as any on the face of the globe. Yet there is no doubt but that the climate has, along with the en tire physical condition of the country, undergone a very sensible change for the worse since the times when the judgments of desolation, spoken of in Scripture1), received their accomplishment. The destruction of trees has in many places exposed the face of the land to the parching rays of the sun. Elsewhere fountains have been choked up ; and the atmosphere being thus deprived of its ordinary supply of moisture emanating from the soil , has , as the first natural consequence , not been able to return it in the shape of rain. The \u00abearly and latter rains.) have indeed .not ceased to come down from heaven , but their amount is now comparatively small2). Reports of an increase of rain during the last six years have been believed by many who are longing for the promised restoration of the Holy Land. We have only to call to remembrance the united prayers offered up at Beirut by Chri stians, Jews and Mohammedans during the winter of 1854/55 for the blessing of rain , when in February , the time that the \"latter rains** usually- begin, not a drop of the \u00abearly rains\u00bb had yet fallen, to show how Uttle foundation there is for these rumours. In the chapter on Routes anel Distances we have quoted the va rious sources from which the)- are derived.

The coastline from Tripolis to Beirut is followed after Major Scott's Map. as are also most of the detads in Lebanon and Antilebanon, not, however, without much correction and modifi- cation. The spelling of names is throughout Maj. Scott's Map such, that the true appellation is often scarcely recogniseable. Between Tri- polis and Beirut the itineraries of Thomson1). Maundrell, Burckhardt. G. Robinson and Thrupp have been of much service (see Route 1). From the mouth of the Nahr el-Kelb to Sidon the coast was laid down according to our own observations. \u2014 Ritter (vol. XVII) has with his own talent collected and compared the information of various tra- vellers who visited the high regions of Afka, 'Akurah, Bsherreh, &c, by different routes. So far as was possible these routes were intro- duced , amongst others those of Squire, Leake and HamUton, 24/25 April 1 802 , from Jebed to 'Akurah direct, and hence by Sar- dak to Ba'albek2); and Th. Weber's journey in 1S50 from Afka to the coast , leaving 'Akurah on the right, along the Northern bank of the Nahr Ibrahim3). In a general way we must observe, that the whole region between the high dorsal ridge of Lebanon and the coast is yet very imperfectly known, and the want of points fixed by triangulation is here sadly felt. Exhausted by the excessive and long continued fatigue of our travels , and hurried to Beirut by the approaching departure of the steamer, we could ourselves add nothing to the geographical knowledge of these parts, beyond what we saw on our journey from the Cedars by 'Akurah and Afka to Beirut. The wild and magnificent gorge of the Nahr Ibrahim was never yet examined below its fountain at Afka down to its mouth 4) . The equally deep rent chasm of the Nahr el-Kelb is somewhat better, but still very im- perfectly known. \u2014 More acquainted are we with the course of the Nahr Beirut , especially through the researches of Col. von AVilden- bruch , who in the autumn of 1844 took several sets of bearings, amongst others from Kurnayil, Ras el-Metn, the summits of Jebel el-Keneiseh and Jeb.

But the position of these summits and the high Alpine tracts of meadow and forest on their high Eastern sides was fixed by our routes from el-Hurmul to the Cedars. In Major Scott's map these parts are also laid down. No other European travellers seem to have known or at least mentioned this beautiful part of the great mountain chain. The lower mountainous region South and S. AV. of Tripolis with Amiyun and the beautiful ruins of a temple to the S. E. of it, as also Beziza with similar handsome ruins , have been filled up from Ehrenberg's and Russegger's maps , corrected and augmented by the accounts of Burckhardt, G. Robinson and Seetzen3) ; but the distances and other details of their descriptions seem so conflicting, that it is im possible to draw therefrom any thing like an accurate representation of the country. Major Scott's map furnishes nothing better in these parts. An entirely new survey has here yet to be commenced. The Nahr Kadisha, as being followed by travellers from Tripolis to the Cedars, is somewhat better known. \u2014 Maj. Scott's map has here proved very useful after receiving corrections from Callier and especially Dr. E. Robinson'*). But also here we want the measure ment of angles before we can accurately fix the positions of the vil lages and convents overhanging the awfully magnificent, gorge of this interesting river. The details of the higher regions between the Cedars and the fountains of the Dog-river have been referred to in Route 4. Seetzen's Reise, I, 167. 169, 186, &c. contain several interesting particulars of villages and sites to the AV. of the ordinary route from Bsherreh to Afka and in other places of these districts. But. unfortunately (like ') Bibl. Sacra 1848 p. 14; Ritter XVII, 805. *) Porter, Five years &c, I, 13. 3) Ritter XVII, 593 sq. '\u2022) Lat. Bibl. Res. p. 583\u201458\u00b0. See also Route 2."], [44, "32 most of Seetzen's notes), they are too incomplete and too confused to be of service, if not corroborated or filled up by information from other sources. There exists some little confusion about the names given by the natives to the highest ridges and summits of Lebanon, near and about the Cedars. Russegger calls the high ridge N.E. of the Cedars Jebel Arneto , and Dr. De Forest gives as the names of its two highest summits Fum al-Mizab and Dhor el-Khodib, the latter being the highest peak of all Lebanon. Another cluster of high , snow-clad summits rises S. of the Cedars , facing the former ridge. This ridge is called Jebel Makmel (or Miikhmel by E. Smith), which, according to von Hammer (Wiener Jahrb. 1843 CIIL, 43 ; in Ritter XVII, 744) means the \u00abback of a camel\u00bb. Ritter has justly observed, that this latter name has been applied wrongly by Ehrenberg , Russegger and Dr. Roth (in v. Schubert's Reise) to the high ridge N. of the Cedars. But Dr. Robinson1) remarks, that the name Miikhmel is at the most a mere local name used at Tripolis, and apparently nowhere else, for the highest peak of Dhor el Khodib, and not for that mountain in general. .dt ought\", so he concludes, ((therefore, to be dropped from the maps, \"unless for that peak ; and the more general name of Jebel el- Arz or ujebel Bsherreh substituted)). Dr. Kiepert, in the map which accom panies the Later B. R., has nevertheless retained the name (and we think rightly so) of Jeb. Miikhmel for the group S. of the Cedars. This group is also very high , nearly as high as the one N. of the Cedars , and its shape corresponds perfectly with the appellation of a \"camel's back\u00bb, a name which cannot be given to the conical shaped summit Dhor el-Khodib. AVe, therefore, believe, that the people at Tripolis, when affirming, that they knew the name of Jeb. Miikhmel as appbed to the highest peak of these mountains, referred to the high group S. of the Cedars, and not to the conical peak to the N.E. The latter we heard on our way from Ba'albek to el-Hurmul and thence to the Cedars constantly called el-Miskiyeh, \u00abthe waterer,.. a name which Robinson (L. B. R. p. 531) heard applied by a man at Yunin to the whole northern section of Lebanon. No appellation could be more expressive than that of \"the waterer.., as this highest of the snow clad peaks of the great mountain-chain is indeed the principal feeder of its sources and streams. From Jebel Sunnin northward the name of Jebel Libnan is also much in use, as well for the general appellation of the whole range, as for its different parts. S. of Jebel el-Keneiseh the mountain-chain goes by the name of Jeb. Baruk, from the great valley el-Baruk at its western base. This is one of the most picturesque ravines of all Syria. Burckhardt, Brocchi , Dr. Meryon, De Bertou and E. G. Schultz are the travellers from whom the most ') Lat. B. R. p. 593, 594."], [45, "33 information of this magnificent valley is derived '). Relative to the high banks N. overtopping the Baruk river, Schultz and de Bertou have supplied us with details which are found in Route IS. The Biika'a or great valley of Coelesyria was chiefly laid down from Scott's map , with corrections and additions gathered from our own travels , and those of Robinson , Porter , Thomson , Callier, Burckhardt, &c. Robinson quotes (Lat. B. R. p. 542) the bearings taken from the curious monument near el-Hiirmiil by Thomson, and communicated in the Bibl. Sacra 1848 p. 694 sq. These differ considerably from those which we took ourselves on 10 June 1852. (See the Itinerary.! On the watershed of the Buka'a we have made a remark in the chapter on Elevations. In addition to E. Smith's list of names in the Buka'a several others are enumerated by Ritter (XVII. 219, 220) from Burckhardt. Some of these we were enabled to fix in our Map ; but several remain as yet to be confirmed by future travellers. Burckhardt's orthography leads here, as in many other places, to much confusion. The fountains of the Litany and the remarkable ruins near 'Anjar andMejdel 'Anjar, visited and described by Burckhardt, Thomson and Porter, were also visited by Dr. Robinson, S June 1852 (Lat. Bibl. Res., 495 \u2014 498). From the journals of these travellers we have corrected Maj. Scott's map for this part. For Antdebanon, its plains, plateaus, valleys, streams and routes. Porter's travels have furnished our chief materials. Through his valuable researches this part of Syria, till lately very imperfectly known by the routes of Maundrell, Seetzen, &c, has been at once laid open. Porter's descriptions of the splendid scenery and the interesting an tiquities found in some of the glens by which the S. Eastern ranges of Antilebanon are intersected, make us feel anxious, that he may intro duce some of these detads in separate sections on a large scale to his map. In a second edition of his map the villages of Hilwy, Ekfair and Mazri'a, mentioned near AA'ady el-Kurn on his route from Beludan to Kefr Kuk2), had also better be introduced, and the position of Ifry altered as being placed at too great a distance from 'Ain Fijeh ''). AAre have already mentioned the unfortunate mistake of the Variation of the compass which occurs in this map. Assisted by Mr. Porter's bearings mentioned in the Bibliotheca Sacra , and the descriptions in his Five years &c, we have been able to profit by his survey in dependent of the mistake of the Variation. At the R. Geogr. Society of London Mr. Porter's original large map , from which the one pub lished is a faithful reduction , was kindly shown us and we could thus \u25a0) Ritter XVII, 85, 87, 97 Sec. 2) Bibl.

I, p. 335. van de Velde, Holy Land. 3"], [46, "34 convince ourselves, that the error existed in this document as well as in the printed map. \u2014 AATe ought here to notice that Maj. Scott's map contains some parts of the great central chain of Antilebanon laid down with much accuracy, as the later researches of Mr. Porter have shewn. Such are especially the Barada- valley and the routes from Zebedany to Ba'albek. Of all existing maps none show more confusion in these parts than that of Zimmermann. Perhaps this is chiefly owing to want of discernment between the often conflicting statements of different travellers. Maundrell, Pococke, Heyman, Schweiger, Brown, Bogar, Monceaux, Richter and many others besides have all been consulted by that author, and the various ways, in which they mention the names and positions of the same places, have caused Mr. Zimmermann to overlook, that here existed much identity, and to take them as so many distinct villages, rivers, sources, mountains, &c. On the Eastern road from Damascus to Homs occurs a section \u2014 from Hasya to Kara and Nebk \u2014 where Porter's map is less cor rect than in its other parts. This is owing to the necessity in which he found himself to travel by night as a precaution against an attack of the Bedawin. \u2014 Assuming that in Major Scott's map Tell Naby Mindau on the left bank of the Orontes (N. of the limits of our Map) is correctly placed in relation to Homs and Riblah , we have used Porter's bearings on this point from Shemsin (see Porter's map). AVe fixed also the position of Nebk according to Porter, who here again was enabled to' measure angles. In Seetzen's Reise, I, p. 25 sq., we have found some details to complete and compare here Porter's distances. Our route from Nebk to Hasya thus constructed does not run so far E. as that of Porter, and Kara is considerably nearer to Ras Ba'albek in our Map, than in that of his. A glance at the fancy shading of the Northern ranges of Antile banon will show, that nothing is as yet known of these mountains. On our journey from Ba'albek to el-Hurmul we noticed one lofty peak rising above the surrounding summits ; this seemed the highest top of the range and has as such been marked in our Map. Section 3. This sheet contains amongst others the Southern section of Mount Lebanon, known as Jebel Rihan. In Routes 14, 15 & 17 we have already mentioned de Bertou, von Richter, AA'Uson, E. G. Schultz, Dr. Meryon (the author of Lady Hester Stanhope's travels), Burckhardt, Buckingham, E. Smith, Dr. De Forest and lately also Dr. E. Robinson as the sources, from which wehave derived information on this point, besides what we gathered on our journey from the Litany to Jezzin and thence over the Pass S. of Toum Niha to the Kuweh bridge and Thelthatha. The course of the Litany (which in its lower part is called Nahr el-Kasimiyeh) was fixed by several visits which we made to its banks"], [47, "35 at different stages of our journey. Ritter has already noticed the erroneous manner, in which this river (especially its middle part) has been introduced in Lynch's \u00abdadurch ganz unbrauchbar gewordene Karte )\u00bb. AYhen Ritter compiled his description ofthe Litany, many parts of it were very imperfectly known. AVe notice particularly the erroneous distances given by Ritter2) between the different bridges, by which the river is crossed. The bridges are all fixed in our Map, and we have elsewhere3) given several views of the wild and ro mantic stream , some of which were not obtained without much difficulty. The hill-country between the coast and Southern Lebanon from the Nahr ed-Danrur to the Nahr el-Kasimiyeh , hitherto almost a perfect terra incognita, has been filled up with much new information. partly from our own researches, and partly from those of others, Buckingham, Callier, Wolcott, De Forest, E. Smith and E. Robinson. The country N. of the Auwly river is the part least known of these districts. On the other hand the country E. of Sidon as far as Jezzin, and the highway from Sidon to the Jisr Khardeli with many places to the E. and AAr. of it (see Itinerary), have been fixed with some degree of accuracy by triangles. Mr. AVolcott's bearings between Jisr K'ak'aiyeh and the coast near Ukhbiyeh have been of great service for this part4). Between the Auwly and Kasimiyeh the principal stream is the Zaharany. Its course has been fixed from our own researches , com pared, as far as regards the upper-part of the river, with those of Dr. Robinson. The higher sources of this beautiful torrent, which according to Schultz5) are near Deir Muzeiri'a, we were not able to visit. Here, on the elevated Northern banks of the Zaharany, Schultz found Khai el-Kuleya, KhanBeni-Rajis, Khan Barghitas, Mezra'at Barakedes and Khan Keituleh, in which he recognised the German Crusaders' posses sions of Couleya , Beni Roges, Bergoiss , Baraquedes , and Queitoule. Even if we knew the exact position of these places , the scale of our Map would not admit of their introduction in this mountainous region : but we cannot refrain from expressing the wish, that some future traveller may undertake the construction of a detailed map on a large scale of these parts , including also the sources and upper-branches of the Nahr Sanik6) and the valley of the Baruk river with its steep, magnificent banks of which we had merely a glance from Rummiet Rum.

Tlie rocks and breakers at a short distance from the coast in this latter part were fixed by angles measured from the hills in land. The positions of 'Akka and Ras en-Nakura, astronomically fixed by Lieut. Symonds' triangulation, have been of great assistance in fixing all other principal places to the N. of the latter point. Besides these, Carmel (the Cape and Convent) \u2014 fixed by Lieut. Symonds and afterwards taken in our series of angles measured from the high pass S. of Toum Niha \u2014 , Tabor, Safed, and the Jordan's inlet into tho Lake of Tiberias , have been among the chief positions which served to combine my own survey with that of the R. B. Engineers , and to shut in all other smaller triangles of this sheet between the large ones formed by the points just mentioned. AVe have in the Itinerary given all our series of angles in order that, whosoever likes to do so, may construct and verify them wherever this may be desired , either by examining our Map. or by comparing them with the future researches of other travellers. To enter into more details upon these matters, would interest few Students of the Holy Land, and certainly be tedious to many. The district of AVady et-Teim has been constructed chiefly from our own survey. Hasbeiya was made (from 30 Dec. 1851 till 12 January 1852) a central point of investigation. The journey thence to Hunin and Bint-Jebeil, and subsequent measurements (27 , 28 May), taken when travelling from Kades to Banias and again to Kul'at esh- Shukif, have enabled us to lay down the portion of our Map between Hasbeiya, Banias and the Huleh-Lake, Kades and Kid'at esh-Shukif with much accuracy. The course of the Nahr Hasbany and the streams which join this torrent , so erroneously represented in most maps, is fixed according to our own observations and confirmed later by those of Dr. Robinson and Mr. Thomson1). The configuration of the Huleh -lake was determined on our journey from Safed to Kades (26 May; along its shores2). Dr. De Forest kindly gave us afterwards his published account of a journey he made in 1849 along the Eastern side of the lake, which we found to be a valuable contri bution to the topography of this region3). A'on Wildenbruch also visited the Bahr el-Huleh and took bearings on its Western beach4). It seems strange, that the position of Safed should be given in nearly all maps, even in that of Maj. Scott and in Robinson's last map, as too near the N. end of Lake Tiberias. A close examination and comparison of the existing itineraries would have shewn this ') Later Bibl.

Symonds has fixed Safed in its true position. In Zimmermann's map of Galilee his triangulation has been turned into account. Safed formed also a principal point of our own net of triangles, and by fixing its proper position, another question has been solved, viz. the distance between Lake Tiberias and Bahr el-Huleh , which has generally been represented too small. \u2014 Seetzen's and Burck hardt's itineraries are too vague in these parts to show how far the Jisr Benat Yakub is from the entrance of the Jordan into Bahr Tu bariyeh. But a M.S. map of Lieut. Dale (of L1 Lynch's expedition . left at Beirut under the care of Dr. E. Smith, corroborates the distance between the two Lakes as found by the construction of our triangles. The course of the Jordan between the two Lakes was followed by Lieut. Dale . and we have introduced this part of the stream from his sketch. The W. side of the Lake of Tiberias was constructed from our own observations, Lieut. Symonds' triangulation, and the con tributions derived from Lynch. Robinson, De Bertou and Molyneux. From the latter we have inserted the depths of the Lake in fathoms. In our Itinerary , 2 1 May . we have referred to the impossibility in which we found ourselves to explore the Eastern side of the Lake. In our Map this coast is laid down according to De Bertou. M. Isam bert has constructed a map of the Lake of Tiberias, from the obser vations of Lynch and the maps of Jacotin, Kiepert, Zimmermann, &c. which was published in the Bulletin de la Soc. de Geogr. de Paris, 4me Serie, TomeATII, No. 37, Janvier 1854. The author has especially had the study of the ancient historical geography of the Lake in view. In this respect the map has certainly its merits. Not, however, as a contribution to modern geography. The province of Belad Besharah , such a blank on former maps, has been crossed and recrossed by our Itinerary , and in addition to these travels we have used those of Seetzen, Schultz, AVoleott, Ro binson & Smith. The bearings taken by the latter from Belat1) differ considerably from those we took on 20 February 1852. Similar discrepancies occur in other parts of the country. The cause of these differences we have alluded to in the Itinerary under 1 May. Here, at Belat, the ..violent wind.) which the travellers experienced, had pro bably an additional influence by shaking the needle of the compass. The bearings from Belat are important because of the central position of the place : Belat connects Tyre and other places on the coast with several points of the interior , which in their turn form central posi tions for fixing other parts of the country.

In this sheet Mr. Porter's researches have added con siderable information. Damascus and its extensive plain '), its villages. ruins , rivers 2) , lakes and routes ; the plain and mountains of the Ha'uran, and the interesting Lejah are chiefly followed from his survey. The great merits of Porter's travels in the Ha'uran and Lejah (which he nearly had to pay with his life) have been already referred to. AVe have used his researches here in the same manner as in the Northern section of this Map, constructing his angles and measuring his distances as much as possible independently from his map , and comparing, supplying , and sometimes too , correcting the latter with the routes and other particulars given by Seetzen , Burckhardt, Gail lardot, or Fezzy-Beg. The provinces of Jedur and Jaulan , or the country between the Banias- Kefr Hauwar and Damascus road and the route followed by Porter from Bozrah along the AA7estern edge of the Lejah to Damascus, are in his map the least correct , as would be natural from the fact that he did not visit these parts himself. Burckhardt's routes , completed by Seetzen's notes , remain here as yet the chief authority. By con structing his itineraries independently from the maps of Kiepert, in which they have been introduced, we have found the positions of some principal points, like Nawa (Neve), Sunamein (Aere) &c, to agree with the distances by which they are given in the Tab. Peuting. and the Itin. Anton. \u2014 The position of Fik, which was fixed by our own angles. and which is much nearer to the Lake of Tiberias, than it is generally placed in the maps , was of much service in the construction of these routes3).

But either his bearings and distances are incorrect, or the relative positions of Nawa, Mezarib and Edhr'a are wrong, for it is impossible upon any existing map to place Tell 'Ashtereh in such a manner as to make it agree with Capt. Newbold's figures. Little have we been able to satisfy ourselves in constructing the course of the Sheri'at el-Mandhur and the long, deep cut wadies which supply this river from the Jebel Ha'uran. But we would rather say, that the whole country East of the Jordan has still to be properly surveyed. Comparatively little is known of it yet ; and the numbers of ruins and sites mentioned by Seetzen, Burckhardt, and also Porter ), which cannot be laid down in map for want of accurate information, shows what an immense field for exploration here is extant. Un fortunately the researches made by Mr. Porter show, that the difficulties in travelling through this region are as great now as ever, and it is not likely, that they will decrease till the lawless, marauding inhabitants are brought under a control at once firm and just , severe and bene volent . or in other words , till a new dispensation dawns on this now desolate land. For Mount Hermon, fixed by our triangles, we have received much valuable detail from Maj. Scott's map, and the explorations of Porter. Seetzen's Reise (I, 319 sq.), Burckhardt's and Buckingham's Travels have been used for the neighbourhood of Rasheiya s) . This town was also visited by Dr. Robinson; but Dr. Kiepert's map in the Later Bibl. Res. is far from being correct in this part. According to the text of the Lat. B. R. p. 427, 428, 430 and 431, Rasheiya lies about E. N. E. of Naby Suffah, whereas the map places it E. S. E. On the beautifully wooded slopes of Mount Hermon a number of ancient ruins are found of temples and other places of former heathen worship. Burckhardt mentions several of them and visited some. We ourselves went to some and took sketches. Others again have been described by 'Ihomson, Porter, Robinson. &c. To the Rev. Mr. Thrupp's M.

Section 5. The 'Akka-Tiberias triangulation of Lieut. Symond* continues in the Northern part of this sheet and is connected with his Yafa -Dead Sea triangulation in its Southern part by the following points, also determined in the same manner\") : Wely Iskandar, near Um el-Fahm ; Shekh Zeit , near Kefr Kud : two nameless mountains near Yasir; the castle of Kakun; the village et-Taiyibeh S. S. E. of Kakun ; 'Alam el-Uda, a wely on a summit S. AV. of Mount Gerizim : the peak called Kurn Surtabeh ; and Deir Ghussaneh. The coastline is followed partly according to Jacotin's map, which is here far more accurate than in other parts. An unpublished sketch map of the route followed by part of Lieut. Lynch's expedition from Yafa to C\u00e6sarea proved very useful. Buckingham (Travels &c. p. 183 sq.) also gives here particulars which are valuable. Von AVil denbruch & Russegger's itineraries (those of the former accompanied by a sketch-map) along the Eastern part of the long extended plain \u2014 the ancient Plain of Sharon \u2014 have been of service , but furnished us as yet with an imperfect description of this part of the country. We have especially felt the want of information about the hdls between Um el-Fahm and Kakun. Judging, however, of a distant view, which we had from Ja'arah, on our way from Kaisariyeh to el-Lejjun. these hills contain very few- villages or ruins, nor do they present any remarkable physical features. Their lower or AA^estern parts are tree less , but covered with a fine grassy clothing ; higher up toward Um el-Fahm they are beautifully wooded. Dr. Barth's wanderings2, among the lower parts of these hdls have also been consulted. Mr. Thrupp's notes of his journey from the bridge over the N. el-'Aujeh to Mukhalid have removed every uncertainty about the ruins of Arsuf. which found an erroneous place in Kiepert's map of Pa lestine accompanying the Biblical Researches. The same traveller has also given us some information about the marshy tract of country S. of the Nahr Falaik (orFalekl and the little Lake formed by these marshes quite near that river ; this is the Moi el-Tempsakh (the Lake of cro codiles) of Russegger3), seen from a distance of some two hours.

The Later Biblical Researches have been here as elsewhere closely consulted1). \u2014 The Rev. E. Smith, accompanied by the Rev. S. H. Calhoun, made a journey in April 1843 from Jerusalem to Kefr Saba, Mejdel &c, by what seems to have been the ancient Roman road from Jerusalem direct to Caesarea. He took a number of bearings on that occasion with his smalkander compass (alluded to elsewhere in this Memoir) , and these , although containing many errors , have yet been of service in fixing most of the places he mentions on this route2). Our own route from Nabulus by Kerawa and Kefr Kasim bas further completed this portion of the map. Unfortunately bad weather prevented our taking observations on that occasion. The Shekh at Mejdel gave us some information relative to several places to the E. of that village, mentioned in E. Smith's list in the Bibl. Res. They have accord ingly been introduced in the map. The words <mot examined,, further indicate , where the researches of future travellers are most required. Much new information was also obtained from Robinson and Smith's last researches in the mountains immediately S. of the Ramleh-Jerusalem road by W. 'Aly. Wdson , Tobler , Thrupp and other travellers have besides been consulted and compared with our own route from Yafa to Jerusalem. (See also Route 61 .) The central part of this sheet , the Jenin-Jerusalem road through the Mountains of Ephraim, is laid down in Maj. Scott's map with much detad and upon the whole also with accuracy. Our own routes , the valuable bearings taken by -AVoleott between Jerusalem and Nazareth , Ritter, \u25a0 the Biblical and Later Bibl. Researches have been the materials , from which we have constructed and compiled. (See Routes 54 and 60.) The mountainous country E . of this track , and the valley of the Jordan , are parts about which ver)' little was as yet known. Their exploration has been justly esteemed as difficult on account of the burning climate and the marauding Bedawin , and also on account of the fanatical and lawless inhabitants of Jebel Nabulus. As so little of these districts is known , we have given the description of our travels here (Itinerary 8 \u2014 16 May) with more than ordinary detad; and the construction and filling up of our Map is from the result of re searches then made. Robinson and Smith's route in 1852 has been compared with these, from Jerusalem to Deir Jerir, Daumeh, Akrabeh and Nabulus. AVoleott' s bearings between 'Ain Yebrud, Kuriut, Kubalan, Hawara and Nabulus3); Dr. Barth's excursions between Jericho and Nabulus (in Ritter XV, 462 sq.), and E. G. Schultz's tour ') A fragment of these travels oFrom Antipatris to Emmausu was also published in the Bibl. Sacra, July 1853 p. 523\u2014544. *) Bibl. Sacra 1843, p. 478 sq. ) See also Ritter's remarks on the importance of these bearino-s Erdk XVI, 674."], [61, "49 from Seilun to Kefr Istuna (ib. p. 45S sq.). Not only has nearly the whole mountain country E. of Nabulus, from Jerusalem to Beisan, been laid down with considerable detad , but also Lieut. Symonds' triangu lation between Jerusalem, Taiyibeh, Kurn Surtabeh , and the N. end of the Dead Sea; Wolcott's bearings ; some also of those by Robinson and Smith ; and our own measurements have covered this section of the Map with a net of triangles, by which almost all the chief points are laid down with accuracy. Feeling confident in the positions thus fixed (among which are also Tell Fasail , tbe Jordan ford on the Na bulus-es-Salt road near the ruined Jisr Damieh , the two fords near Sukkuth and Beisan) , we have not hesitated in changing the general direction of the Jordan as given by Lieut. Lynch. AVe believe that all the windings of this river exist nearly as he laid them down ; but as these were derived from the somewhat rough observations made in the boats , by compass , and as the longitudes were only observed at three places of the Jordan , at the bridge near Semakh close to the Lake of Tiberias, at el-Biikaa, and at the ford S. E. of Jericho , we believe that the great bends of this river , as laid down in Lynch's map, may be modified without changing much of its detailed windings. The manner, in which this river was surveyed, perfectly allows such modifications to be made. \u2014 Lynch's latitude of Jisr Damieh 32\" 7 2-1 ' proved a very valuable control for our measurements between Nabulus and the Jordan , and we were glad to see the correctness of the latter confirmed by his astronomical observation. - Strange errors have crept into Lynch's map, not only in the construction of the route of part of the expedition from Damascus to Beirut by the Kuweh bridge over the Litany, but also into the section of the Jordan valley. the more direct object of their researches. So, for instance, was Beisan placed far too much to the North ; AVady Yabis 3 too far South \u2014 perhaps in consequence of the name being given by the Arabs at the wrong place \u2014 ; Kurn Surtabeh , that prominent mountain , is placed 1 */2 hours too far from the Jordan ; and also Jericho , and the Jebel Kuruntul are placed at too great a distance from the river. Another mistake exists in the Latitude of Jisr Damieh , which in the Table of Latitudes and Longitudes (p. 68 of the Official Report) under 1 6 April is given 32\" 7 24\" (which agrees with our construction by triangles;. Yet p. 28 we find for the observed Latitude at noon 16 April 32\" 6' 39\"; and starting at 121' 5' (p. 55) the boats arrive at 2'1 27' at the camp nearly opposite Jisr Damieh. According to the distance S. thus made, the Latitude of Jisr Damieh is 32\u00b0 2' 50\" and has been laid down as such in the map. How to account for this difference of 4' 34\" in Latitude between the map and the Report p. 28, and the table of Latit. & Long. p. 68, we are unable to explain. AVe are only left to regret 'that such an error exists. Here we may also remark, that in Lynch's Chronometrical Tables no mention is made of the place at which the chronometers were last van de Velde, Holy I.nnd. 1"], [62, "50 regulated and their time compared with that of Greenwich. This omission makes the longitudes of the expedition valueless, as no means are placed in our hands to judge of their correctness. The remarkable valley of the Jordan (or as it is called el-Ghor), although used in the days of the Roman Empire and again in those of the Crusaders' dominion, as one of the high-ways from the Southern provinces to Galilee , was , since the Bedawin have been lords of this part ofthe country, entirely abandoned by travellers. Seetzen saw only its Northern portion as far S. as Jisr Mejami'a , and its Southern end near Jericho. Burckhardt went from Nazareth to Beisan, and thence crossed the Jordan, following its Eastern side to Abu-Obeideh and then turned up the mountains to es-Salt1 . Irby and Mangles crossed and recrossed the Ghor in 1818 near Beisan and at the ford on the way from es-Salt to Nabulus. The count De Bertou was the first tra veller , who gave us a detailed account of the Ghor and its side wadies (both large and small) between Tiberias and the Dead Sea2). His enumeration of these wadies has been followed in our map between Jericho and Tell Fasail and again between A\\r. el-Ferrah and AV. Maleh , so far as we found if corroborated by other information. The last or Northern most of the AVestern side Wadies of the Ghor is AV. Besum. called AV. el-Fejaz (Fadath by de Bertou) in its lower part'1). Eli Smith travelled through the length of el-Ghor in 1844, but the notes he took on his journey here and in the country E. of Jordan, were lost in a subsequent shipwreck. Lieut. Molyneux1) made in 1817 a most unfortunate attempt to examine the Jordan and its valley , which ended in the plundering of his boat, the flight of his men, and a few days later in his own death, the consequence of being harassed by the Arabs and exposed to a burning sun and excessive fatigue. Next has followed the expedition of the United States' naval officers. Our own travels have shown us the Ghor in its most beautiful part, the oasis of Kerawa ; at Fasail : and from the mouth of W. Maleh to Beisan. '\"') There remain for future research the parts from Jericho to Kerawa, and thence to W. Maleh. The ruins of el-'Aujeh, Nejemeh, es-Samieh, N. of the Jebel Kuruntul ; those on the top of Kurn Surtabeh ; the ruins of Um- Harath , Hamzeh , Maufi , of which we had a distant view ; those of es-Sumrah, Suweida and Muktafa, still further N.

Of the country East of the Jordan , this Section contains the AVestern slopes, a portion requiring indeed much research. The lower Yarmuk was introduced from Seetzen and Burckhardt. Better known is the country between Beisan, Sukkuth and Kefr Abil (including the remains of Pella) , from the joint researches of D'* Eli Smith, Robinson and ourselves. This portion is introduced with accuracy. \u2014 The author of the map in the Later Biblical Researches has here allowed himself to deviate considerably from Dr. Robinson's text. He places the mouth of AV. Yabis due E. of Sukkuth, although the text p. 317, note, gives the direction of Sukkuth from the former by bearing 237% \". Hence the direction of the route followed by Dr. Robinson , Dr. E. Smith and myself from the mouth of AArady Yabis to Kefr Abd is in that map far too northerly; and hence also is Kul'at er-Rubiid (see Section 6) placed by Dr. Kiepert too much to the north1). As a place which forms a prominent feature in the outlines of the country and which consequently becomes a chief point in the measurements of these regions by angles, the right position of Kul'at er-Riibud is rather important. Section 6. The observations made on the construction oi Section ! refer also to this sheet. Porter's travels in the Ha'uran, from the Ku leib \"little heart*), the highest peak of Jebel Ha'uran, to Bozrah were for these parts the chief sources of our information , not , however, without comparing them with those of Burckhardt and Seetzen. Seetzen went in the beginning of 1806 from el-Hiisn near the Lake of Tiberias through the mountains of\" Ajlun and Belka to Kerak. His notes complete in many parts Burckhardt's travels, which we have followed in constructing his itineraries, independently from the manner in which they have been laid down in other maps. The result is, that the country, representing ancient Gilead and Ammon, differs in several points from other maps. At the same time we claim no pretension to greater accuracy, than our scanty materials could yield. In this sheet is inserted a Map of the environs of Jerusalem, on a scale of onestat. mile to half aninch. Its title indicates the sources from which it was constructed. It shews, however, a great difference as com pared with the \"Environs of Jerusalem.) in the map which accompanies the Later Biblical Researches. This discrepancy, Ibelieve, mustbepartly explained by the incorrect bearings, which have been used in the con struction of the latter. In the Itinerary under 1 May we have referred to the causes of this incorrectness, to which may also perhaps be added. that sometimes the learned travellers took their bearings too hastdy. Indeed, what has been remarked of Burckhardt's bearings in the preface to his Travels (p. Ill), may also be said of D\" Robinson and Smith, ') See the bearings in Itinerary 12, 13, 15 and 16 May. 4 *"], [64, "52 i. e. cithey fell into the error of multiplying bearings to an excessive degree. ..instead\" of verifying a smaller number and measuring intermediate ..angles with a pocket sextant.\" It is perfectly impossible to apply the bearings of the Biblical and Later Biblical Researches either on our own detail-map of the Environs of Jerusalem, or on that constructed by Dr. Kiepert . and referred to above. Certainly Lieut. Symonds' triangulation has here fixed many points once for all : the learned American travellers too have among their bearings several correct ones which are of importance ; also AVoleott has here added valuable obser vations ; andDr. Tobler's pedestrian excursions in the vicinity of the Holy City give many minute and valuable details. Yet, with all this infor mation the \"Environs of Jerusalem.) must be considered as imperfectly laid down and waiting for more accurate survey at some future period. Section 7 Between Ekron and Gaza we have chiefly followed our own researches. By touching the coast at 'Askiilan and following it as far S. as en-Nesleh, the humble representation of Gaza's ancient port , we were enabled to correct the erroneous configuration of this part of the coast, such as it was first given in Jacotin's survey and has ever since been copied in subsequent maps. In Maj. Scott's map this has been corrected. From the \"Narrative.) of the Scotch mis sionaries, who went in 1839 on a visit of inquiry to the Jews, we have gathered some details on their route from Rafiah to Gaza and thence by es-Sawafir to the entrance ofthe AVady \"Aly. Robinson's routes and bearings in the country of the Philistines have been used in connection with those of our own. At Hebron, Beit-Jibrin, 'Akir, Gaza and Kefr Zakaria we collected the names of several places and ancient sites, some of which were introduced into the map, on being verified afterwards. About others again we could learn nothing more . and these we give here according to the information we received from the natives. Ruins and ancient sites around Hebron.

This was much to be regretted, as it is possible that Tell-' Athar and Tell Ma' a mark the sites of Ether and Naamah , two of the cities of the tribe of Judah, in the Eastern part of the plain, where the lower AVestern portion' of the central Judea-mountains take their rise. (Josh. XAT. 12, 11). Future travellers wid, we hope, ascertain the positions of these sites. At Gaza the following names were given us of ruins between that city and Tell Hessy , and S. of the latter: el-Hawadeh , el-Adar, el-Asifriyeh, Um el-Khedeh, Burej, el-Menshiyeh, Nasrah (or perhaps en-Nasirah) andSharatah. Other ruins were mentioned in the desert S.E. of Gaza : Sbeta, 5 hours S.E. of Gaza, to the S. of AVady Sheri'ah. el-Mush reis ah. 4 hours E. of Gaza. Kul'at el-'Aujeh, 4 '/., hours S. of Sbeta (see Robinson, Bibl. Res. I, 282 . ) el-Meniyeh, I hour S.W. of Khiilasah. Um el-Jerar, '/, an hour N. of Tell Jema. Tell el-'Ajur, 1% hours S.AV. of Gaza, at the entrance and S. of Wady Ghuzzeh. Shubaneh, 2 '/a hours S.AV. of Gaza , near the coast. These distances, especially those of Sbeta and el-Miishreifah, are evidently too small. Seetzen, in 1807, heard of the same ruins. He gives their names as Minnieh , Sbetha , Auje and Mischwepheh ; he also adds Ezbebe1;. By the village-shekh of Kefr Zakaria the following sites were added to our list : Deir Esrah. about 30 E. of Kefr Zakaria. el-Lauz, 15 N. of d\". Um Zeirah , I hour AV. of d\". Kiileidiyeh, 30 S. of d\". Kayafa, 15' E. of Kiileidiyeh. esh-Shukh, 30' N.E. of Kefr Zakaria. el-Lameh (or Alameh) 1 hour S. AV. of d\". The names of so many places still unknown sufficiently show how much of the country there yet remains to be explored. Such amongst others is the road from Beer Sheba to Hebron (see Route 72) , tra velled over, indeed, by numbers of tourists, but nevertheless far from being accurately known. The Rev. Dr. Stewart of Leghorn has lately given close attention to this road, and mentions several ruins and an cient sites2) , some of which have confirmed the information which we received at Hebron. ') Ritter XIV, 132. 3) The tent and the khan, p. 216-225."], [66, "54 The road from Hebron to Jerusalem was in 1852 examined anew by Robinson and Smith. Wolcott's bearings too, especiaUy those in the Northern environs of Hebron, have been of good service. There remain yet, however, many points to be fixed by triangulation, which are now only laid down by bearings and itineraries , and which are far from being correct. Strict accuracy in the section of country between the two ancient royal cities, has not yet been obtained. There is a portion of the Judea-hills W. and N.AV. of Hebron, and another portion E. and N.E. of that town, where research and survey are even more re quired than elsewhere. These parts lie completely out of the tra vellers' routes ; and only those who will make a special point of ex amining them, are likely to furnish fresh materials wherewith to improve the future maps of Palestine. The Desert of Beer Sheba, occupying the Southern part of this sheet, has been travelled over by ourselves (see Itinerary 30 March \u2014 1 Aprd) from the Southern extremity of the Dead Sea to Bir es-Seba. There are no places here on which bearings can be taken. Kurnub, 'Ar'arah and Bir es-Seba have been fixed according to our travelled distances , and these were shut in between the accurately fixed position of Jebel Usdiim at the Southern end of the Dead Sea and that of Beit Jibrin. In addition to this the position of 'Ar'arah was controled by its distance from Tell Mdh, a point ascertained by bearings on Tell 'Arad from Robinson and Smith's travels in 1838, whilst Tell 'Arad again was fixed by our route from Hebron thither in 1852. AA7ilson (vol. I, p. 347 sq.) adds several remarks on the routes in these parts , by which he him self entered Palestine. Here as in other parts ofthe country his \"Lands of the Bible.) have been consulted. Had Wilson's bearings been taken in a manner less vague , his travels would have been of still greater service for our Map. \u2014 Seetzen's ..Reise.) B. Ill, pp. 8, 9, 27 \u2014 32 (from Hebron to Mejdel Baa, and thence between Semoa and Shu weikeh down to W. el-Khulil and the plain of Beer Sheba, which he kept 2 hours to the E.) have also been consulted. W. el-Khulil wants . however . examination as does the whole of the undulating track S. , S.E. and especially S.AA7. of it, towards Gaza, a portion of country relative to which we possess scarcely any information at all. The continual warfare, kept up since many years between different hostile Bedawin tribes on the banks of AV. Sheri'ah , has prevented travellers crossing the land from Beer Sheba to Gaza. AATe hope that others in future wdl be more fortunate. The Dead Sea is introduced from the survey of the United States' expedition under command of Lieut. Lynch ; but not without much modification. If a line is drawn from the mouth of the Jordan to the Southern end of Jebel Usdiim, that line in our Map inclines far more N. E. and S. W. , than in the map accompanying the American of ficial Report. Er-Riha is placed in Lynch's map 1' more to the E. than in ours: but this difference in longitude increases to 2'/Z at"], [67, "55 the Southern end of the Dead Sea. This is the result of the con struction of Robinson's bearings between er-Riha and Jebel Usdum in 1838, and of those taken by AVoleott in 1842. The N. end of the great salt-lake, Kasr Hajla and er-Riha we have laid down as points positively fixed by Lieut. Symonds' triangulation^ Ro binson's bearings from the high cliff above 'Ain el-Feshkhah1), from the cliff above 'Ain Terabeh2). and from the N. end of his mea sured base at 'Ain Jiddy3) connect the Jordan entrance, the mouth of W. Zerka Main, Sebbeh, Ras Mersed, the extreme ends of the Peninsula and Jebel Usdum with these points. Robinson mentions that his bearings at 'Ain Terabeh and 'Ain Jiddy were taken with his large compass , and as such we cannot but trust their accuracy. Sebbeh, Point Costignan and Point Molyneux were also fixed by these bearings and agree with those of our own and with Wolcott's bearings from Sebbeh taken on 'Ain Jidd)' and connecting at the same time the Northern and Southern ends of the Dead Sea'1). AYhdst Lieut. Lynch's observations were chiefly made on the water, De Saulcy's visit to the Dead Sea has acquainted us with many details on its AArestern and S. Eastern shores. Some of these have been also briefly sketched by Mr. H. Poole''). The altitudes, routes and further particulars communicated by this traveller are mentioned under the Elevations and Routes 74 ec 75. \u2014 Mr. Poole does not mention any ruins at the N. base of Jebel Usdum. He notices only the heap of stones , a sort of cairn ,' called Um-Mzoghal or Um ez- Zoghal. In the Athenaeum of 9 Sept. 1854 occurs an article on \u00abThe cities of the plain.), in which the author (who signs himself >.a pilgrim'.. hut who appears to be anything but an illiterate pilgrim) corroborates oto the fullest extent.) the statements , which we have elsewhere ) given on that subject : \"that between the round heap of stones ez .\u2022Zogheir (Um ez-Zoghal) and the Saracenic ruin at ez-Zuweirah et \"tahta, there are no vestiges whatever of buildings, &c.\u00bb The East side of the Dead Sea was wandered over by Seetzen, climbing and clambering over desolate frowning cliffs, of which he gives a description not calculated to excite many followers. But he mentions also spots of beautiful vegetation at the openings of some of the wadies on the sea side , especially on the beach S. of the AVady Zerka Main. AVe have given his track; but the confused and imperfect state of his notes, which he has not been spared to work out himself. ') Bibl. Res. II, 250. \u25a0) ibid. 240. \u25a0') ibid. 213. ') Bibl.

In all that relates to the country S. of Kerak, Burckhardt remains as yet the chief authority. AVe have here , as elsewhere in using his travels, constructed his itineraries independently of their constructions in other maps ) . From De Saulcy's journey from Kerak to Shihan, and thence down to the Dead Sea-Peninsula, by AV. Beni Hamed, we have introduced some new details ; they were not obtained by that traveller and his party without much difficulty. \u2014 Seetzen's Reise, I, 416 and II, 354, 356, &c. furnished us also with new materials, by which Burckhardt's travels have been augmented. Irby and Mangles visited Kerak from Hebron (Travels &c. 3iS \u2014 455). Section8. The journals ofSeetzen and Burckhardt have been here again the sources from which this sheet was filled up. The previous remarks we have made on their researches and on the publication of their notes, not by themselves , but by others (Sections 4 & 6^ . refer also to the portion of country from Kerak to Hesbon, given in this Section of our Map. The sheet contains also a Plan of Jerusalem, constructed, as its title indicates, from the triangulary survey made in 1841 by Lieut. Symonds, and from measurements by Dr. T. Tobler in 1845 and 4 6. It is a reduction of the same plan , on a large scale , accompanied by a memoir by Dr. Tobler, recently published at Justus Perthes, Gotha. There existed a difference of opinion in Dr. Robinson's plan and that of Dr. Tobler on the ruined reservoir at the E. side of the Damascus gate. Tobler held it to be merely a quarry ; but it was examined by Ro binson in 1852 and pronounced to be a ruined cistern. Birket el-Hej jeh, left out in Tobler'sPlan of Jerusalem, was also confirmed by Robin son, who saw men drawing water from it into the city.3) The tradi tional places are not marked in this plan , because of the great dif ference of opinion which exists on their identity. AVe give, therefore. Jerusalem as it is in its present state. It seems strange, that on the existing maps of Jerusalem the position of the city with regard to the magnetic North line should be given in such various ways. Catherwood's plan, that of Robinson's map in the Lat. Bibl. Res., and others after Catherwood . have corrected the magnetic north for 10\" W., the Variation being considered to amount to this figure, when Catherwood took the measurements of the city. The Rev. G. Williams in publishing with his \"Holy City\u00bb Lieut. Sy monds' plan of Jerusalem , did not apply the Variation at all ; and as such that plan has been inserted in Ritter's Erdkunde. Th. XVI, and ') See also Ritter XV, 566 sq. *) Burckhardt, Travels 389, 390, 395 -401. :') Later Bibl, Res. p. 191, 192,"], [69, "57 also in the \"Narrative* of our travels vol. I. Hence the Eastern city wall, and, of course, the whole city along with it, seems in these various plans to have a quite different direction, whilst the truth is, that when Lieut. Symonds' plan is corrected for the proper ATariation, viz. 8\u00b0 15' AA7., the Eastwall of Jerusalem leans 23/4\u00b0 less to the AVest , than it would seem to do from Catherwood' s plan, and S1/,0 more than appears from the R.

It then for a few minutes allows, through a sort of opening in the hills , a view of the deep embosomed Kasim iy eh , but soon turns E. N.

Furtajil , a Christian village, is then seen at about. 15 to the N.W. andAthshith some 25 further to the West. K'ak'aiyeh is reached in 2h 30' from Zerariyeh. It lies 30' to the N.N.W. ofthe bridge of that name, several hundred feet above the river, enjoying splendid views of its gorge. Immediately on the side of K'ak'aiyeh Wady 'Ain 'Abd el-' Al comes down to the river, from the E. N. E. passing by Zautar. Jisr K'ak'aiyeh is a remarkable ruin of Roman construction with repairs of a later date. It was formerly defended by a castle1).

The ruined castle of Marun , the villages of Kalaweih and Burj Kala weih are visible on the right : the latter is passed at perhaps 10 distance, I1' 15' after leaving the river. The road now again approaches Wady Hajeir and the villages of Khurbet Selim on its high Western bank , and Mejdel Selim, Sau waneh and others on its Eastern side come in sight.

February 20. Kept at Tibnin by stormy weather till to-day. Went to Ter Harfa. The road passes Haris , Surrebin \u2014 with an cient remains \u2014 (Seribbin by Robinson, L. B. Res. p. 61), and then follows down the beautifully wooded Wady 'Ayun to the place where it is crossed by the great road from Safed tc Tyre. Some 20' further down S.W. the wady turns round to the N.W. with a sharp angle. Here Beit lif, with ancient remains, is kept on its hill close upon the left hand. At a well, on the N. side of the valley, called Bir Asal, we left the wady, and the guide took us by a wretched hill path through the jungle to Salhani, nearly I1' 30' from Beit lif, perched on the high precipitous cliffs overhanging the Wady 'Ayun. Salhani is entirely built of ancient hewn stones, the evident tokens of an ancient site. Opposite this village, on the S. side of a kind of valley, are the ruins of another ancient place now called Belat. Here, on the broad summit of a rock forming the highest part of all Belad Besharah, are a great mass of large hewn stones scattered about, and among these the ruins of an ancient temple, which seems to have been of very primitive construction.

From Nabulus to Kerawa by Kefr Kullin, the ruins of 'Ain Mokhna , Hawara , 'Ain Abuz , Jem'ain , Zeita , Harit and Deir Istia. This is a route very rarely travelled , even by the natives. The plain of el-Mokhna extends to Hawara, where a high hill, on which the village of el-Kauzah is perched, seems to shut itin. However, the road divides to the right and left of el-Kauzah's mountain, the Eastern branch winding up by a Pass along Yetma and forming the high road to Jerusalem , and the Western branch leading to 'Ain Abuz, 30 from Hawara, whence a zig-zag path ascends to the summit of the pass (which we reached in about half an hour) ; from this point an extensive view is obtained, includ- ing the Mediterranean Sea. A little further on , a few hundred steps to the left of the road , a fountain is passed and an ancient tomb shaded by some venerable olive-trees. Jema'in , about 15' further, is a large vdlage on a hill, but lower than the Pass. We should here have crossed the valley South of the village, the continuation of Wady Makh- furiyeh which begins near Akrabeh , and then have gone to Kefr Harit and so to Kerawa. But our guide mistaking the road we turned W. N. W. to Zeita, nearly 20' from Jem'ain ; then crossed the said wady to Harit and through an unin- teresting undulating country, sloping gradually to the AVest, a rocky region with no cultivation except a few stumpy olive - trees , came first to Deir Istia , a large village with ancient remains, at lh 30' distance from Jem'ain, and next to Kerawa, also a large village, but in a very miserable con- dition, on the N. bank of the large AVady Kerawa1). ,, 9. From Kerawa to Ras el-' Ain and Mejdel. Stormy weather made travelling to-day extremely difficult. At el-Khureibeh, half an hour beyond Bediya (lh 45' from Kerawa), we were obliged to take shelter for a whde : but as the rain continued, we had to beat right through it. Passing through Kefr Kasim we noticed the many ancient stones used in the con struction of the present houses and many other remains in dicating an ancient site.

Excursion to the large cavern in Wady Khureitum , to Tekua, and to the so called Frank mountain or Jebel Furei- dis. Endeavoured to make a bargain with Shekh Hamdan of the Ta amirah-Arabs for a safeguard to the S. AV. end of the Dead Sea and other places, but could not succeed. 24. Went to visit the pools of Salomon and thence proceeded to Hebron by the ordinary route. At rather more than 3 miles from Hebron branched off to the right in order to visit the large evergreen oak called ..Abraham's oak\u00bb, some 20' AV. N. AV. of Hebron. 25 and 2G. Detained at Hebron by stormy weather. These were the last storms we encountered. The weather, although sometimes cloudy , and even in the beginning of May inter- rupted by a single shower, continued fine from this time. During these last storms the snow fell at Hebron ; but it melted almost immediately. 27. Having succeeded, with difficulty, in making a bargain for a safeguard to the Dead Sea and other places , from Shekh Abu Dahuk of the Jehalin-Arabs, left for his camp , on the banks of Wady er-Rmad, passing by TellZif, Kurmul, Tell Main , Tell 'Arad and the sites of several ruins, which are laid down in our Map. 29. From Wady er-Rmail with three Bedawin of Abu Dahuk's camp to Sebbeh (the ruins of Masada). The road crosses the desert mountains of Judea in a N. Easterly direction. In about one hour, it rounds the Northern base of a mountain called Jebel Araam ; peculiar for its high , roof-shaped top. The heads of four rocky glens were now rounded, W. Amrah, W. Bghiyeh , and two smaller ones which all unite lower down, and form Wady el-Bedun and as such approach the Dead Sea. In AVady Bghiyeh a httle water was found, stid remaining in the hollow of its rocky bed. Half an hour before reaching Sebbeh, a little water was again found in the bed of a winter torrent. We arrived at Sebbeh in less than 4 hours from Wady er-Rmad. The ascent of the rock, on which this interesting ruin stdl remains in a remarkable state of preservation, is exceedingly difficult and tiresome , and in some places even dangerous .

En camped near Wady Hatrura. In the bed of this wady our Bedawin found some water yet remaining. March 30. Having followed yesterday's course for another hour and a half we came to the brink of the precipices, by which a difficult path leads down to the Wady and ruin of ez- Zuweirah et-tahta. The descent takes about an hour. \u2014 Fodowed Wady Zuweirah down to the plain, upon which it issues, as do also AA7ady el-Mahairwat, coming from theW. S. AV. and other smader wadies from the N. AV. and South. Skirted the Northern and Eastern1) base of Jebel Usdiim, the latter along the shores of the Dead Sea, and turned up a most difficult and dangerous path along theN. side ofAVady el-Em'az. After this first ascent of about 800' a plain of 1 mile in breadth is crossed : then follows a yet more difficult ascent of no less than 1700'. The path now turns to the water course of AA'ady el-Em'az , where we found a httle water in the hodow of the stones , but of bad taste and colour, and fuU of insects. A table-land is now reached, having indeed a steep descent towards the S.,but continuing uninterruptedly to the W. ; we fodowed this plateau for about two hours , and then rounded the head of AA'ady el- Fa'ya intending, if possible, to reach the ruins of Kurnub. But the long distance we had travelled to-day (having been in the saddle from 6 a. m. till S p. m.), the hot oppressive climate in the vicinity of the Dead Sea, and the dreadful roads we had to descend and ascend, exhausted my people and myself so completely, that we felt compeUed to encamp 2% hours to the E. of Kurnub. The last drinkable water we got this day, was at the reservoir of Zuweirah at 9 a. m. Here a water-skin was fided, which had to last us throughout the day, but this provision was soon exhausted, as we were seven in ad , each of us equady feeling the effect of the hot ') In our Narrative of a journey &c. , II, 114 \u2014 116 a mistake occurs, the words AVest and East with reference to our route along Jebel Usdum being interchanged."], [125, "113 climate we were traversing \u25a0 the consequence was, that we suffered much from thirst throughout the day and more so at our waterless bivouac during the night. The stony region we had crossed since reaching the head of AV. el-Em'az here changed to a sandy track and the bed of Wady el-Fa ya was full of the now flowering \u00abRetem\u00bb, the \u00abJuniper-tree\u00bb of 1 Kings XIX, 4. March 3 1 . At the extensive but apparently modern ruins of Kurnub found abundant and excellent water between the rocks in AArady Abu Teraifeh , a few hundred feet below the ruins. A little higher up a stone-wall was once constructed across the wady in order to form a large reservoir. But these works have long since been destroyed. From Kurnub we went through the pass of the mountain-range called Kubbet el-Baul, to the ruins and weds of 'Ar'arah . Some of the wells are destroyed, but those remaining contain abundance of good water. From Kubbet el-Baul the plain (the Desert of Beer-Sheba) was covered with a beautiful carpet of grass and flowers, presenting the aspect of a vast prairie. A few weeks drought and sun , however , are sufficient to scorch up every thing , leaving nothing but a truly weary desert to traverse. From 'Ar'arah we continued our journey with the escort of one Bedawin only, one having left us to return at Sebbeh , and the second having fallen sick on the road near Kurnub from o versa tigue. April 1 . AVent to Bir es-Seba and thence by'Ted-Lekiyeh and Tell- Hora to Ted-Kewelfeh . Between the two latter is a sort of valley or basin, in which a large reservoir of ancient con- struction is found , a favorite place of the Bedawin for drawing water to supply themselves, their horses and cattle : this is unfortunately a reason for not encamping here , as the Bedawin cannot resist their inclination to plunder. We, therefore, instead of pitching our tents near the reservoir, crossed the heights on the AV. of it and continued our journey for two hours further AV. N. W. tdl dark. Here we had once more to encamp without water, although between lovely hids clad with verdure. Two remarkable teds, Ted Sheri'ah and Tell Melaha, were in sight, the one AV. S.W. and the other AV. by N. from the place where we crossed the heights W. of the reservoir. ,, 2.

To-day feeling a little better, went on to Beit Jibrin, fodowing the high way above- mentioned, after joining it at the site called 'Ajlan. After a few hours rest at Beit Jibrin we proceeded on to Jerusalem , expecting to reach that city early next day. But having mistaken the road at some 30' from Beit-Jibrin, went to 'Ajjur, a vidage nearly 2% hours North of Beit Jibrin and 'thence, across the high and steep Ted Zakaria, down to the broad Wady Sur and the village Kefr Zakaria on its N.

May 1 Met with the Reverend Drs E. Robinson and Eh Smith. Having compared some of the bearings taken by the latter from places, which I also had visited, such as the ruins of Belat, Kiil' at esh-Shukif, Sidon, &c. , and finding con siderable discrepancy between these bearings , we went to the top of a house to compare the Smalkander-compass used by Dr Smith with my surveying instrument. D' Smith's compass was the same , which he had kindly lent me in the first part of my journey and which I tried at Khan Mehemed 'Aly on the 29\"' Dec. 1851, and also the identical compass, with which nearly ad the bearings, given in the Biblical Re searches, were taken. The result of this comparison shewed, that Dr Smith's compass corresponded very nearly with mine in all the angles between North and West ; less cor respondence was found in the angles between West and South; more again in those between S. and E. and a de viation of 2 to 3 degrees was observed in those between E. andN. ; Dr Smith's compass pointing generally too far E. Having well examined my compass in Paris before leaving for Syria, and knowing, that I could rely upon its accuracy, I thought that the chief cause of the discrepancy between his bearings and mine was, that the divisions of D' Smith's Smalkander-compass were incorrect 2) . It is much to be re- ) See also Narrative &c. II, 192. D' Stewart (The tent and the Khan, p. 345) is mistaken in stating, that I stumbled on Beit Zakaria and passed a night in it.

Prof. H. Berghaus of Potsdam, who 'constructed the observations of Robinson and Smith's travels in 1838 in the first instance beiore D' Kiepert undertook this work, kindly communicated unto me the calculations and constructions , which he then made. Among these documents was the following information written by Dr Robinson to Prof Berghaus* ..The bearings too are mostly from him (M. Smith) ; since it was he alone \u00abw!io could get from the natives the names of places seen in the distance - It \u00abwas my habit to take the bearings of the more important places, which I knew \u25a0"], [129, "117 gretted, that the bearings of the Biblical and Later Biblical Researches were not made with a better instrument. Also the bearings quoted in the Later Bibl. Res. from Dr Eli Smith's M. S. journal of travels in 18-14, were made with the same defective instrument. May 3. Having, by the aid ofthe British Consulate, made arrange- ments with a shekh of the Ta amirah-Bedawin for a safe- guard to the Northern end of the Dead Sea, the Jordan, Jericho and thence to Beitin (the ancient Beth-el), we left, accompanied by two English gentlemen, for the Greek con- vent of Mar Saba.

Hence the road descends steeply through a short vadey, caded AVady el-Ghur;\\beh, to a plain of considerable extent , known as el-Biikei'a. This plain is crossed with an E.N.E. course, and the narrow Wady Ku- neitirah is now fodowed through its manifold windings between dreary hids and cliffs of white soft limestone mixed with flint and dark coloured stones of a volcanic formation.

The nature of the soil is soft clay, of a light yellowish colour, strongly impregnated with salt, which here and there appears even incrusted on the surface. Through this soil the many streams, formed by the winter rains in coming down from the mountains, have cut their beds, greatly thereby impeding the progress of the traveller, who has to cross these manifold crevasses.

Leaving Akrabeh, the AVady Makhfuriyeh is crossed in a S. Easterly course and the opposite slope traversed. This slope has a slight elevation, leading to a plateau, whence the ruin Kefil and the vdlage Jurish may be seen in one line AV.S.W. % AV., the latter above the former. The AVestern part of Wady Makhfuriyeh then disappears behind a broad swed or hid on the right. At 50' distance from Akrabeh the first view is enjoyed of the Ghor and of the splendid Surtabeh group with its high ruin crowned conical peak, called Kurn Surtabeh. In the early morning, when the shadows mark distinctly the outline of the mountains, this view is one of the finest in Palestine , and is ad the more striking on ac- count of its novel character. The pale yellow of the barren mountain sides, the glowing vadey of the Jordan, the splendid blue tints of some of the parts covered with brush- wood , and the forestlike plain through which the river winds, gives the whole scene a peculiar character , such as is not found in other parts of the land ; the elevation too, from which the view over the deep embosomed Ghor is obtained, adds to the grandeur of this extensive panorama. A smad ted with a nun , called 'Ain Tana, is seen from this point less than a mde off in a straight line, but on the"], [134, "122 first lower plateau, into which the road to the Ghor descends. Mejdel, on the border of the high crest, which is now approached, is reached in I1' 10' from Akrabeh. It bears evident marks of antiquity. \u2014 Kurn Surtabeh is N. 88\u00b0 E. from it. The brow of the mountain S. of Mejdel is broken by a gorge , called AVady Bursheh , which forms the head of A\\rady Fasad. The road from Mejdel to Daumeh winds round AVady Bursheh, and taking a S.S.E. course, reaches the latter place in about 45 minutes. A few hundred yards S.W. of the village stands a piece of wall , evidently the ruin of some large ancient budding , which from its steep brow overlooks the gorge below. A commanding view is here obtained of the surrounding country. We noted the following bearings Kum Surtabeh N. 66\u00b0 30' E.

I then came upon Ain Fasail , a beautiful spring overshaded by wdd fig-trees and shrubs of various kinds, the prickly oak and retem especiady2). Its water ripples down the wady for about 45' till it reaches the tell and ruined vdlage of Fasail, where it is lost in irrigating the gardens of the people of the latter place. In the cliffs on the S. side of the wady several caverns are visible, as also an aqueduct leading from the spring to the ruins of the former city of Fasaelis. From these ruins Kurn Surtabeh bears N. 35\u00b0 E., the summit of a high mountain behind the place N. 150\u00b0 AV. , and the Southern base of Kurn Surtabeh N. 75\u00b0 E.

Passing by the ruin Abu Kharib we reached in one hour the brow of the mountains which May 11 descend into the Ghor, being here about N E. by E. of Jurish. A descent of 10' to the East leads do^n to the first lower plateau, a richly cultivated plain, where we found several people engaged in their gardens. Five minutes further on a wed is passed. The road now makes a short bend to the N.E. over a bank of rocks, and resuming its easterly course, leaves 25' beyond the well a smad ruin Meraj ed- Din to the right, after which it descends in 30' to the second lower plateau. This we reached in 2h 10' from Jurish. Five minutes further we passed some smad ruins on the left, but our guide did not know their name. In this second plateau our path joined the high road from Nabulus to es-Salt, through AVady el-Ahmar , or, as it is here called, AV. Zakaska. The wady is entered 1 0 from the last mentioned ruin, and the road leads down to the third plateau, which is crossed amidst corn-fields ; the traveller is here entirely shut in"], [136, "124 E, the by a horse-shoe of mountains called Jebel Ihhma, but he soon gets out of it again as the path turns up by the hdls on N. side. Here another wed is passed at 30' from the entrance of AV. Zakaska. Shortly after the last pass is attained, offering a magnificent view ofthe well watered and consequently richly wooded oasis of Kerawa with its luxuriant fields and gardens, and its oleander-bordered brooks1). A descent of an hour and a half after leaving the last well brought us to the Bedawin camp of Kerawa, the chief of whom is now Shekh 'Abdeh. The abundance of water, which has turned this part of the Ghor into such a perfect garden, comes chiefly from the stream which runs down through AVady el-Fariah or Ferrah. It is here almost exhausted in irrigation and little of it reaches the Jordan, to the South of the ford on the road to es-Salt. Some 5' S.E. from the camp we found the ruins of an ancient mid and the foundations of houses ; 15' more to the S., and AV. of the brook, which meanders through the plain, is a wely called Abd-el-Kader2). The road leaves it on the right and now approaches the low S. Eastern end of a rocky ridge, called el-Makheruk3), which shuts in the oasis of Kerawa on its East side, separating it thus entirely from the great Ghor. This rocky ridge contains excavated tombs and other remains of antiquity, which we noticed from a, distance, but could not visit for want of time. At 40' distance from Kerawa the road touches a fine spring caded Yosela , and has marks of an ancient Roman pavement. Kurn Surtabeh bears from this point N. 135\u00b0 AV. \u2014 The ancient road con tinued from the spring East towards a bridge , the ruins of which we saw from the hills on the side of the river , but since the bridge was destined, the stream is passed by wading through it some 15' lower down at a place, which we reached in 1 h 40' from Kerawa. The water here did not reach much above the knees. \u2014 Kurn Surtabeh bears from the ford N. 95 AV. \u2014 We noticed here the many turnings and windings of the Jordan as described by Lieut. Lynch, and also the peculiar shape of its high banks4).

The soil of these hdls is of a soft chalky na ture, easily crumbling away, and consequently the embank ments have been worn and torn by time and weather into rows of irregular whitish pyramids, which, seen from a distance, greatly resemble a camp of gigantic tents. From the many winding tracks of vegetation inclosed in the plain between the embankments, some at not a little distance from the Jordan, it would seem as if the bed of the river properly speaking occasionally shifts , a circumstance which has also been noticed by Lieut. Lynch. AATe tried to get to the ruined Roman bridge , but found it impossible to work our way through the rank vegetation and over the marshy ground, Turned back in the afternoon to Shekh Abdeh's camp. The sirocco already noticed on the 7\"' May at Nabulus had continued ad these days. The heat and suffocating feeling in the Ghor, yesterday atFasad and to-da)* in this place, was perfectly intolerable. It was worse than I had ever expe rienced in any country, not even excepting the burning Karoo of South-Africa. Perfectly exhausted by heat and fatigue, I found it impossible to ascend the Kurn Surtabeh, which, however interesting for the determination of several places, would now have been useless labour, since the atmosphere, filled with impalpable dust, obstructed every distant view ; and when next morning the wind and weather suddenly changed , masses of clouds came rolling down the moun tains , preventing in another way my taking observations from this peculiar summit. Its true position, I was after wards glad to find , had been already fixed by Lieut. Sy monds' triangulation. May 12 Left Kerawa for Tamun. Following the AVest side of the fine oleander - skirted Ferrah - stream , through fields and gardens, and passing the foundations of houses and remains of an ancient via\"Romana, we had, at 25 from the camp, the ruins of a place on our left, called Shuneh. Fifteen minutes later we entered Wady Zeika , through which the Ferrah brook flows to Kerawa. This is a narrow glen remarkable for its numerous natural caverns and peculiarly coloured sand and limestone-rocks. After 20' march we issued on another plain, called el-Basaliyeh , from a ted of that name 25' fur ther in the N.W. part of the plain , close by the road-side. Numerous ancient hewn stones and foundations of houses at the foot of the ted mark the site of an ancient town. On the East side this plain is hemmed in by a row of high hids,"], [138, "126 of which the ridge el-Makhruk forms the Southern ex tremity. On the two highest summits of these hills , so the Arabs at Kerawa informed me, are ruins called Um-Harath and Hamzeh. The road crosses the Ferrah brook at lh 30' from Kerawa (having hitherto followed a course of about N.AV. by N.) , and then runs up on the N. side of the stream , deviating thus from the latter, which has a ge neral course of W. N. W. through a narrow wady shut in by steep hdls. AVe took at first a path up this wady, but were soon informed by the Fellahin, who were here just gathering their harvest, that this was not our track ; so we turned up to the right, away from the AVady el-Ferrah, over graduady rising pasture-ground , cultivated here and there, but everywhere showing the greatest fertility and causing me no small feeling of regret, that so rich a sod should thus lay waste. The path winds a good deal; its general course, however, is N. N. AV. At 2h 40' we again found remains of ancient dwellings on both sides of the road, but our guide did not know wheiher they had any particular name. Ten minutes later the ruins of Thala on a small tell were half a mile off on our right hand side. As the road now skirts the Eastern base of a high broad hill, a fine plain opens running AV.N.W. and E.S.E. It seems graduady to slope down towards the Jordan , without being interrupted by mountains and only shewing some isolated hids, between which the descent to the Jordan appears quite easy , even more so than by any way I have since noticed in other parts of the Ghor. At a distance of 3 hours from Kerawa a ruin caded Maufi came in sight, about 30' off, and bearing N. SO0 E. in one with the high perched Kul'at er-Riibiid beyond Jordan. Going round the N.W. shoulder of our hill in 10' more we came to the ruined village of 'Atuf, which bears unmistakeable evidences of being the site of an ancient city. Here are several old wells with excellent water. 'Atuf lies on the N.AV. slope of the said hdl , bearing: Kul'at er-Rubiid N. 78\u00b0 E., Maufi N. 83\u00b0 E. ; our guide pointed out the direction of Tannin N. 50\u00b0 AAr. Having enjoyed breakfast at the wells of 'Atuf, we continued our way in a W.N.AV. course to Tamun , distant lh 15' from the former place. The plain of 'Atilf is shut off by a kind of narrow rocky valley from that in which Tamun is situated.

And as I did not succeed in securing another guide from among the Ta nnin-people , I was obliged to return once more to Nabulus to obtain one. From Tamun our course was first 30' West over the high rocky ridge of a mountain, which may be said to form the N. Western promontory of the range which bor ders Wady el-Ferrah on the N. side. A steep and difficult descent of about 20' brought us to the plain S. of the ridge, called Ard Smeit , a beautiful fertile spot watered by one of the streams coming down from the N.W. along Burj el- Ferrah, and conjointly with other similar brooks forming the river el-Ferrah. At 15 from the base of the mountain. in traversing Ard-Smeit, we passed a wely and the ruins of a place. Of neither of them, however, did our guide know the name. The stream from Burj el-Ferrah is now crossed, and AATady Bidan, the S. Western upper and chief branch of AA7. el-Ferrah approached, at the point where it winds round a high mountain and sharply changes its course from N.E. to S.E., with a deep rent chasm. Two more streams, from the AV.N.W., join the one of W. Bidan, after working several mills ; these brooks too have to be crossed, and the path is for a while difficult to find because of the marshy state of the ground and the rank vegetation there abounding. But after crossing the third stream, it turns up to higher ground, and fodows the rocky bank above AV. Bidan tid nearly right under and AVest of the wely Naby Belan, where it joins the great road from Nabulus to Beisan , which keeps higher up on the West pf the wady.

We were nearly 4h 30' from Tamun to this city. The true distance may be, however, 15 or 20' less, as we lost some time in wandering through the marhes below Ard-Smeit. May 13 I obtained another armed guide or Khayal from the Metzel lim of Nabulus. Here I again met with the Rev. Drs E. Robinson and Dr. E. Smith. We agreed on going together for an excursion to the Northern part of the Ghor and, if possible, across Jordan in search of the remains of Pella, this being very nearly our common object ). AVe left Nabulus at S'1 50' a.m. After fifty minutes travelling on the previous day's road we hadAzmud, Deir el-Atab and Salim nearly in one line S. 42\u00b0 E. At this place the road divides, our path from Tamun deviating more to the E. and fodow ing the gorge of AArady Bidan considerably below the Beisan-road, which skirts the mountains on higher ground. AVe did not remain long on the latter, but soon turned off first North and then N. AV. over a rough path between the hids and across a vadey parallel to the one we had fodowed from 'Askar, to Talusa2). The situation of this village (we reached it in 2 10 from Nabubus) on its high hill and surrounded by extensive olive -groves is very fine.

This village here becomes visible on a hid in a sort of little mountain basin, its situation being very like that of Tamun.

It is situated at the Eastern end of a smad plain surrounded by high hills. Two valleys, AVady Maleh to the S. E. and \\Arady Khusneh to the N. E., lead from Yasir to the Ghor. About 20' before coming to this village, we saw the ruin Selhab , on a smad hill distant about half an hour N. N. W.

As we did not go to see how far these ruins may extend away from the stream, it is difficult to determine, whether they belong to the remains of a city or perhaps merely to those of a bathing establishment , as it seems naturaj, that this spring should have been used for hot medicinal baths in ancient times as well as now. Leaving the bed of AVady Maleh with an E. N. E. course we struck over a plain gently sloping Eastward to AVady esh-Shuk ; this vadey we entered and in 30' from the hot spring came to another hot, but tasteless spring. Turning to the N. E. away from the wady, we passed a few minutes later ruins of some extent, called Khurbet esh-Shuk, and 10' later other ruins, smader than the former and without name. The road has here come down to a sort of swell, projecting from the gentle slopes of the Western mountains into the Ghor tdl very near to the narrow vadey, which incloses the bed of the Jordan ; we struck across the un- dulating ground in a N. Easterly direction and in about 40' reached Siikkuth, a site on a ted formed by the elevated Eastern termination of the swell. The foundations of houses 9*"], [144, "132 ') el- are all that remain to mark the former existence of Succoth. These foundations are of unhewn stone. A hundred yards lower down on the N.

This luxuriant vegetation is owing to an unusual richness of water, as we soon per ceived in crossing within an hour's time three splendid brooks, the latter of which, called 'Ain el -Beida, is the largest, and having its source a little to the N. A\\r. of Ted el-Humah1). The people of Tubas and Yasir come to this part of the Ghor to cultivate the fertde sod. Half an hour further N. AV. we came to another stream, larger than the former and issuing from AArady Khusneh to the E. N. E. On its S. side is a ted covered with ruins, and foundations of houses are also visible on theN. side. The place is caded Berdela. AAre found here a few peasants living in miserable hovels. A little beyond Berdela we waited for some time under the shadow of a large sidr-tree on the side of a wed for our muleteers with the luggage ; but finding ourselves disappointed, we continued for 15 further N. to another fountain, caded 'Ain Makhus, where we pitched our tents amidst a part)' of peasants from Tubas , here temporarily settled for gathering their harvest, at which they were joy fully engaged. The muleteers and luggage were sought for and conducted hither by one of the servants. In the afternoon Dr. Smith having spoken with the people which were encamped here, two of their Shckhs, active and good looking young men, offered themselves to take us next day across the Jordan to Wady Yabis , Kefr Abil and by the ruins of Tubakat Fahel back to Beisan for \u25a0Himineh according to Robinson, Later Bib.

My armed guide having been sent with our luggage and tents to Beisan for protection, we started at 41' 20' a. m. only accompanied by the two Shekhs we had engaged. In 30' with a S. Easterly course we came to Ridghah , a place of extensive ruins and a few inhabited huts , on a fine stream N. of which is a wely called Shekh Salim. A splendid fountain, even finer than any I had seen yesterday, gushes forth from under a rocky place at the side of the wely2). If properly used for irrigation, this tract of land might be turned in a perfect paradise. AVe were here hardly a mile to the East of our yester day's route by Berdela. Five and thirty minutes huther we crossed a stream, 'Ain ed-Deir. and again 5 later came to the brow of the lower Jordan- valley. The descent into it is very gentle and not deep.

To this I had no objection as it seemed to me just ; but I little expected, that Dr. Robinson would make an argument of it to prove that I ..simply accompanied.) him beyond Jordan in search of the remains of Pella, and only ..at his invitation.., having ..nothing whatever to do ..either with the plan, the arrangement, the expense, or the result of the ..excursion., (see Later Bibl. Res. p. 315). The mildest answer we can give to such a statement is, that it is incorrect. I went back from Tamun to Nabulus for the express purpose of demanding a Khayal, who was to guard and assist me on my intended excursion to Tubakat Fahel; and would have carried it out just as well without as with Drs. Robinson and E. Smith. But meeting these travellers at Nabulus, and understanding from each other, that we had\" the same journey in view, we agreed in accomplishing it together. All our arrangements were made by joint consent and agreement ; and so fully did I consider our tour combined to mutual benefit, that I freely communicated to mv companions the bearings, which I took on this occasion, and which Dr. Robinson has, with slight alteration, published in the Later Bibl.

AVe now reached the second mountain-pla teau and felt its elevation by the refreshing and exhilarating air , which was all the more pleasant as we came from the depressed broiling temperature of the Ghor. Large and noble oak-trees were studded over the sides of the mountains around us, whilst the thickly wooded higher bids (forming the highest part of the country) rose in our front. At their base lies Kefr Abil, an unimportant village , which we reached in just an hour from our station of bearings on the first mountain-plateau , having passed a well on the side of our road 15' before coming to this place. I saw at Kefr Abil several large hewn stones and fragments of oil-presses, the unmistakeable remains of bygone ages 1) and indicating no doubt an ancient site.

Here we were informed by the peasants. that the name of the ruins was Fahel. Our guides had called them el-Jerm, the moment we got sight of them ; but this proved to be merely a defective appedation for the beau tiful fountain Jerm el-Mauz, which bursts forth in the glen below on the S.E. side of the natural terrace, on which the ruins are situated.

The name Tubakat Fahel, by which Buckingham 2) heard this site designated , and by which it was introduced by D1' Kiepert into his Map of Palestine 1842 with the con jectured identification of Peda, means simply \u00abthe terrace of Fahel*. . This seems to be the appedation most in use among the natives . who, of course, appreciate more the fertdity of the \u00abterrace\u00bb, than the historical interest of the ruins on its S.W. extremity.

This was done to-day by the circuit we had made and by the fullest possible in quiry after any existing ruins. AVe felt sure, that the ruins called Fahel were the only ones answering to the conditions on record which point out the locality of Pella. We left again at 2h 15' and regretted much, that, pressed by haste and fatigue, we could not spend a longer time at this interesting site , and go and examine the ruins of a temple at the fountain in the glen below. Keeping a N.AAresterIy course, we came in 20' to the edge or brow of the ..terrace\u00bb , descended to the Ghor , and at 3U 20 arrived again at the Jordan. The river, however, proved to be too deep and so we turned towards another ford about 1 5' lower down, and a few minutes above a wely on the Western bank caded Shekh D'aud. Here we got over assisted by our guides , one by one , the water coming up to our horses' sides much higher, than at the ford we had crossed in the morning.

AATe reached Beisan at 5h 20' and found our tents pitched in a rather dirty place a little to the S.E. ofthe ruin of a castle or strong tower near the vidage1). This plot of ground had long been occupied by cattle and was now swarming with ad sorts of disgusting insects. May 1 G Encamped at Beisan. In the afternoon Dr Robinson and I visited the ruins on the high tell and scattered at its Sou thern base. The latter belong to the most extensive and in teresting of Palestine. Four brooks or streams run through them, two of which surround the tell and form, as it were, a natural fosse.

He was, therefore, sent back, having given us much reason for satisfaction. But from the ted we had seen the great plain to the W.N.W. studded ad over with the black encampments of the Siikr- Arabs, some of which had yester- day repeatedly visited our tents ; and wishing to avoid being annoyed by them, our parties kept together for the first two hours , after which each went his own way , Drs Robinson and Smith to Kumieh and I to Zer'in. \u2014 On leaving Beisan at 7 a m. in a AV.N.AV. course, we came in 15' at a place where there were foundations of houses , probably of a for- mer vdlage, on the right of our road-side. Several brooks running N.E. to the Jalud had to be crossed and we were by the abundance of their water occasionady entangled in regular marshes.

The view from Tabor is somewhat impeded by shrubs and trees. Descending to the N.N.E. side, Khan et-Tujar was reached in 50' from the top of Tabor , which here bears N. 157\" AV. ; 40' further came to the vdlage of Kefr Sabt. Kurn Hattin bears from the latter N. 22\" E. and Safed N. 19\u00b0 E. At Kefr Sabt begins the head of AArady Besum, which about 40' lower down to the E. is joined by another smad wady coming from Khan Lubieh. Following a path across and then on the high Northern side of \"\\V. Besum, we saw the ruined vdlage of Besum1) some 3/4 of an hour to the S.E. Leaving the side of the wady and turning more N.E., a tedious slowly rising plain or slope has to be traversed for upwards of 1% hours. Not before then the brow of this highland is reached and a sight of Lake Tiberias obtained. The first view of the memorable sea is very fine and striking. It took us quite an hour in the darkness of the evening to descend towards Tubariyeh , where my tent had been pitched for some hours at the water's side , a few hundred paces South of the city. May 21 Early in the morning went to the Metzedim , Mohammed Effendi , to get a safeguard for exploring the Eastern side of Lake Tiberias ; but he expressed himself utterly unable to comply with my desire, the Bedawin being there the only masters and at open enmity with him. This was the only part of Palestine , which I was forced to leave unexplored on account of the insufficient power and control of its Go vernor. I afterwards understood , that several travellers had been attacked and plundered by Mohammed Effendi's own people, between Nazareth, Hattin and Tiberias. After this fruitless visit to the Metzedim, I went along the AArestern side of the Lake as far as Tell Hum and re- turned the same way. \u2014 Bearings from Tell Hum (by pocket compass) : Kurn Hattin N. 126\u00b0 AV., general direction of AVady Humam N. 127\u00b0 AV., Tubariyeh N. 160\u00b0 AV.

The ascent from Tiberias, a little to the N. of the path we had descended from Kefr Sabt, is by far the easiest of the two roads. Some 50' from Tiberias an ancient well is passed. The road thence to Lu bieh, drawing very near to Kurn Hattin , which my guide caded also Tell-Ghenara , is rather monotonous. AVe took May 22 bearings near Lubieh from a solitary house on a hid top W.S.AV. of the vdlage, at about 5' distance from its centre ; Lubieh itself is too low to obtain from it a good view of the surrounding places : Mount Hermon, N. summit andpart of AV.

Na zareth is reached via Kefr Kenna and er-Reineh ; the latter with traces of antiquity. From Nazareth to Safed, round by Sefurieh and Kana el- Jelil. \u2014 From Sefurieh the road descends in an easy manner, winding through beautiful fields and splendid olive-gardens to the great grassy plain of el-Buttauf. Here, at about 50' May 24 from Sefurieh, we came upon an ancient ruined reservoir, and 5' later to a ted quite covered with large hewn stones, called Rumah or Harumah. \u2014 Bearings: Kefr Menda N. 48\u00b0 AV. , Sefurieh N. 159\u00b0 W. , Rummaneh N. 94\u00b0 E.

Following the mountain base for 1 5' East, we came to an ancient wed and the. foundations of former buildings. Half an hour further in the same direction brought us to another ancient well"], [157, "145 at the entrance of a steep ascending vadey , by the side of which we went up. On the pass of the ridge there is a beautiful view of the villages of 'Arrabeh and Sukhnin, sur rounded with garden-clad hills, meadow-plains, and shut in on theN. side by the high and steep mountain-range, which we crossed on our way from 'Akka to Mejdel-Kerum. AVe reached 'Arrabeh in I1' 35' from Kana el-Jelil, bearing Sukhnin N. 58\u00b0 W. at apparently 1 hour's distance. The A'illage is rather* large and shows unmistakeable signs of antiquity-. AVe did not stop here (having still a long journev before us) , but went on , passing by the West side of 'Arrabeh and its large pool some 10' N. of the vdlage. Turning here to the N. E., the large ruined vidage of Deir Hannah (having fortified wads and towers , the work of Dhaher el-'Omar about the middle of the last century) ') came in sight on a hill to the E. S. E. This eminence forms part of a broken group of hids, which run up in a N. Easterly direction, tdl they meet another higher group, along and between which the road winds up to the elevated country, where Safed is situated on its lofty mountain. From 'Arrabeh' s pool the road goes N. E. for about 1 20 across a beautiful, park-like wooded plain. It then enters the hills, and turning more to the N., crosses the fine stream of AArady Selameh , just where it works a few mills in the neighbourhood of a ruin of the same name. The stream is fodowed upwards to 'Ain Selameh for 30 ; here another brook from the N.E. joins it. AVe proceeded by the latter, continually ascending. In 35' another small but beautiful plain is entered, in which 20' further the vidages of Kefr 'Anan and Ferathi, both ancient sites, are situated to the right ofthe road, at 15' distance from each other. As we passed the latter, we saw the high situated Rameh behind us to the left, apparently 2 hours off Passing a mdl (worked by the last mentioned stream 15' above Ferathij the road begins to ascend steeply, and the beauty of the views increase in proportion. From no other place have I seen the Lake of Tiberias to such ad vantage. Having in 35' reached a small plateau, I took the following bearings by pocket-compass: Kurn Hattin South. Mount Tabor N. 168\u00b0 AV., Carmel - Convent N. 105\" W., Tubariyeh N. 157\u00b0 E. In 30' from this place our ascent terminated ; here we had the first view of Safed. I expected to reach that place in less than an hour ; but my guide having kept too far N., and afterwards losing his way, we ) Robinson Later Bib. Res. p. 83. van de Velde, Holy Land.

May 25 As an extraordinary circumstance I saw the early morning- sky charged with heavy clouds; a thunder-storm with a smart shower of rain unexpectedly interrupted the other- wise constant fine weather and drought of summer. The clouds, however, cleared off after the rain and the day was fine again from 11 a.m. Having engaged a guide I went to S'as'a to take a set of bearings , in order to complete my angles of a former occasion (15 January), included in the bearings taken from Kefr Bir'im. \u2014 Bearings from S'as'a, highest house : Tell el-Faras (beyond Jordan) N. 105\u00b0 30' E.

E. and East after 20' distance from the castle, went down by the Wady Fur' am (pronounced as Fera'im) along the side of its little stream. In 45' we came to the lower opening of the wady, had a sight of the village el-J'aiineh S. of the wady and of a hill covered with ruins called Tell el-Kasab in the plain Ard-Asseiferah2) below us.* Fifteen minutes later el-Moghar came in sight to the left against the slope of the hills. In another half hour reached Khurbet el-Katanah, a site with ruins in the plain, bearing Mount Hermon N. 26\u00b0 E., el-Kebaah N. 76\u00b0 W., el- Moghar N. 85\u00b0 W., Fur' am N.

In 15' more we arrived at the old ruined tower \u2014 now a station of toll-guards \u2014 on the AA'est side of Jisr Benat Yakub . where the great high-way passes from Egypt to Damascus. AAre here saw S. of us-the ruin of a small castle, called Kasr 'Abrah , and 5 to the N. of the bridge is the ruin Khurbet Benat Yakub. AVe found the distance from the bridge to tlie place where the Jordan is seen to issue from the Lake el-Huleh 25'. Just here the river diverges a little from the path by bending towards the E., and the space between the river and the path is fided with tad reeds, which make the approach of the water-side impossible. The Southern end of el-Huleh is the best place to judge of the hills on its Eastern side, as they approach the lake almost to the waters edge. On the AVest side there is, on the contrary, a broad plain left between the foot of the mountains and the lake. In 47' from Jisr Benat Yakub we came upon Tell Maru tiyeh , a hid with ancient foundations on the water- side, bearing the former (not visible but distinguishable by a column of smoke rising from the Khan) N. 1 68\u00b0 E., the S. end ofthe Huleh-lake N. 146\u00b0E., its N.E. end N. 35\u00b0E., Mount Hermon N. 30\u00b0 E., el-Kebil'ah N. 120\u00b0AV., and Ted Hurraweh , a remarkable , steep and high hdl on the N.

(by pocket-compass). \u2014 Following the smooth beach or edge of the water (which is of a light-gray muddy colour and quite distinct from the deep, clear blue waters of Lake Tiberias), I was able to trace with precision the size and shape of the Huleh-lake. In 23' from Tell-Marutiyeh we came upon Ted-'Almaniyeh, which bears the former N. 158\u00b0 E., el-Kebaah N. 135\u00b0 AV., a small nameless tell on the N. AV. side of the Huleh N. 51\u00b0 AV., and Tell Hurraweh N. 41\" AAr. (by pocket-compass). Some 15' beyond our ted we passed the hamlet 'Almaniyeh, and, turning then.ce gradually away from the Huleh to the N. W., in I1' and 10' from Ted 'Almaniyeh crossed the beautiful stream called 'Ain Medahah, just where its waters work two or three mills. Few streams in Palestine seem to be so pure and clear1). Following for a whde the base of the mountains, we then turned up AArady Arus by a difficult rocky path, with zigzags.

Just here a conspicuous hill Ted- Ikhsas is seen in the S. E. at the Eastern side of the Jor dan , where the Nahr Hasbany and the united branches of Banias and Tell el-Kady join1). The ruins of Abil are also visible N. by E. Two or three brooks descending from the AAr. and N. from the mountain-sides have converted this part of the Huleh plain into a marsh , which increases in proportion as one descends to the S. E. tdl coming at last to impenetrable pools and reed-covered sloughs. This marsh may possibly have once formed a part of the Huleh lake, at a time, when through a greater measure of rain the quantity of water all over Palestine was greater than now. We passed the numerous rivulets and marshy places with some difficulty till skirting the foot of Ted Haye , an offset of a low ridge , which from the N. runs into the Huleh plain, East of the hills, by which we had come down from Kades.

Just here, at 15' from the bridge, we turned to the N. , across a small plain and up the narrow entrance of AA7ady Jermak. The stream which comes down this valley to the Litany, is crossed a little later, and the poor Druze - village of Jermak is reached in l'1 20' from Jisr Khardeli. Immediately behind this place the chain of Jebel Rihan , the Southern most mountain group of the great Le banon-range, ends in a sharp-pointed peak called Jebel Sidi. From a fountain shaded by a fine weeping willow, I took the bearing of Kid' at esh-Shukif N. 173\u00b0 AV. In 27' from Jermak we passed the ruin and fountain of el-Madineh, and soon after came to the head of Wady-Jer mak. This vadey seems to form a continuation of the one through which the Zaharany comes down ; but a smad ele vation, which lies across, causes the latter stream to turn to the AArest with a sharp angle , instead of continuing its course Southward through the Jermak vadey. Just above its turning point the stream is crossed at the side of a mill, and the narrow road now continues along its AVestern bank through a magnificent forest having the roaring torrent below1). Thus the hdl, on which Jurjua is perched, is reached; its base is surrounded by splendid walnut-trees, oaks and sycomores. The ascent of the hill I found extreme ly painful , both on account of the terrible rocky path and the great elevation. It took us 2h 10' to get to Jurjua from Jermak. Jurjua offers by its lofty and isolated position a splendid point for taking angles. But from absolute want of time I had to urge on, after a short rest, to Jebeah. The road between these two villages I would cad one of the richest in magnificent as wed as variegated views of ad Palestine\"). Nowhere in the land had I seen such luxuriant vegetation, wdd as wed as under cultivation. But this diminishes an hour beyond Jebeah , when the path winds gradually up to the higher, bare and bleak gray rocky wads on the right.

The day of rest at Jezzin, yesterday, was therefore particularly welcome , and so was also its healthy mountain air and the cooling shadow of its walnut trees. I found too the people of Jezzin particularly kind.

We reached Kamid el-Lauz, at the foot of the wady, at ll1' 55'. I was much struck by the particularly clear and extensive view from this place over the Buka'a and the immense mountain-ridges of Lebanon and Antilebanon on its sides1). At I1' 45' left again, and turning to the E.N.E. , went up Wady Faluj, by the great road from Sidon to Damascus. At 2 30 we passed a well in a sort of plain, which is bounded on the N. side by the large hid, on which the vil lage Sultan Yakub is perched. The hid shuts the view to the N. completely out, leaving only Hummaiah, another village N.E. of the former, for a few minutes visible.

Continued to day the high road to Damascus through AATady Kurn , by Khan Meithelun and Dimes , and then across the dreary plain of es-Sahra by the ruins of a Khan at 'Ain el-Ard. This ride is perhaps the most wearisome of all Palestine, and the glare ofthe sun on and from the white soft limestone-rocks cf Antdebanon is almost blinding. The contrast of the view of Damascus, embosomed in its green' ocean of gardens , is wonderfudy striking. It takes I1' 15 from the moment the first view of the city is here obtained to reach its gate, and about 20' more to the Hotel, kept by a Greek of the name of Andrew. Tdl this day in Damascus , a stay far too short for so in teresting a city , but compeded by want of time, as I wished to leave Syria by the steamer of 22 June, I resumed my journeys. Fodowing the high-way to Ba'albek, I got to-day to the midway station, the large vdlage of Zebedany. Another more picturesque but somewhat longer way may be taken by the splendid fountain of Fijeh , which sends forth a large volume of water through the bed of the Barada river. Left at 6'1 5' a. m. \u2014 I continued the ordinary high-way to Ba'albek by Surghaya, reaching this vidage at 8h 20'. De scending hence through beautiful fields and gardens, we crossed at 8h 45' Jisr Romaneh , a small stone-bridge over the upper-branch of the Yafufeh . This stream comes from the N.N.E. and receives three other side-brooks before it is passed by the bridge ; it then turns sharply round to the N.W. inclosed by the high rocky slopes of AVady Yafufeh. 8 ') See pl. 87 in Le Pays d'lsrael."], [170, "158 Three different ways may be followed from Jisr Romaneh to Ba'albek : one by the water-side in AVady Yafufeh to Naby Shit, and thence turning round to the N.N.E. to Bereitan : a second one , the nearest and most travelled, ascends from the bridge over the high hills N. of AA'ady Yafufeh toKhurei beh and Bereitan ; and the third road follows the Northern upper-branch of the river, to Shaibeh direct to Ba'albek. AVe took the second one and reached Khureibeh at IO1' (i . It is a miserable village for the greater part in ruins. Beyond the vdlage there is a steep descent across a little side wady. which goes S. W. to AVady Yafufeh. Bereitan was reached in I 50 from Khureibeh. The vidage is remarkable for its natural caverns , which by the early inhabitants of the land seem to have been modified and used as dwellings. Some 35' further we passed Taiyibeh, and shortly after got the first sight of the famous ruins of Ba'albek. One more vd lage, 'Ain Borday, was passed at 45 from Taiyibeh, and in about 25 more we reached the walnut-trees outside the ruined temple to the S.AA''. of the vidage of Ba'albek. where travellers generally pitch their tents. The remainder of the day was spent in examining and wondering at the stupendous works of human skill and art.

Our course now was N. by E.

At 9h 55a well was passed on the left, surrounded with women from the neighbouring village of Sha'ad , to which the well belongs ; mukharis shepherds and various kind of travellers were also here col lected. Anxious to find a fountain called Ras el-Hadeth, near the small village of that name , of which I had heard, I gladly accepted the good services of a Shekh from Zahleh, who was just passing and offered to conduct us thither. The spring lies to the N.E. byE. at an hour's distance from the well of Sha'ad, bearing Jebel Sunnin N. 115\" AV. and Jebel el-Miskiyeh N. 42\u00b0 W. Its water runs off to the N. W. and is used for irrigation. The fountain was sur rounded by several native travellers, enjoying the cool shadow of a large tree by the side of the refreshing brook . AA'e had passed during the last hour the watershed of the Buka'a '). Setting off after a rest at the fountain at 121' 15' p. m., we fodowed the brook down a while N.AV., and then turned again N. and N.N.E. , passing at 12'' 40' a large tell with ruins to the left. Soon after our path became less distinct , leading between cultivated fields, where in several places the water seemed to issue from the ground , till gra duady the numberless little rills ran together and formed a brook in a richly cultivated valley, which we followed along the slope of a row of low hdls on its AArestern side. I no ticed, as we advanced, in several places new fountains adding their water to that of the brook. At 1L 30 our path took along bent to the N.AAr. , resuming, however, again its course 20 later, after having made a sort of half-cercle. Just as we began to turn to theN.W., the vdlage ofHarbeli was seen in a notch of the hdls a mile off. At I1' 50' we had the first view of the strange monument known as Ka moa el-Hurmul. The road which hitherto had seemed from 1 hour N. of Ba'albek to lead through the middle of the Buka'a at equal distance from Lebanon and Antilebanon. now evidently approached nearer to the former, its foremost hdls, here and there beautifudy covered with cypresses and brushwood , jutting out with broad sweds , whilst those of Antdebanon seemed on the contrary to recede to the East;. The high main ridge of the latter chain being far less ele vated than the one of Lebanon, the view may be, however, deceptive , as the Maps give the Antilebanon chain much nearer to the road, which we fodowed, than the high dorsal ridge of Lebanon.

At 3h 30' we came to a place where our brook, now grown to a smad river, was increased by a fountain and by the con fluence of a stream from el-Fikeh , which thence gives its name Nahr el-Fikeh to the united waters, tid they are over whelmed by the mighty fountain under the rock-hewn con vent of Deir Mar Maron and then wander through Northern Syria as the famous river Orontes, the Nahr el-Asy of the present days. At the place, where the N. Fikeh joins our brook, a beautiful tract of garden-land is seen along the banks of the river , but inclosed on both sides by the high rocky sides of the wady. This place is called el-Merj ; it ends a little higher up, where the steep and sometimes perpendicular sides of the wady contract to the very watersedge. By a mistake of our guide, after crossing here the broad, but not deep stream, we turned up the way to the vidage el-Fikeh, and thereby lost 30' time. The proper path turns up N.N.E., immediately after crossing the river. A tedious undulating plain of hard and unfruitful Karoo-Uke ground now followed. At 4h 45' we crossed a dry wady running off to the N. Fikeh and passed at 51' 10' a fountain , on the right, which sends it a fresh supply of water. Our general course since leaving the ford was N. 32\" E. At 5h 30' we passed a place of extensive, but apparently modern ruins, called Bukdash. The wide spread stones were not hewn, nor did I see any fountain or reservoir. Once more we got into a wrong path leading to el-Ka a and were thereby detained for a considerable time. The sun was now setting and we were yet a good distance from el-Hurmul.

After 45 minutes winding up by a rocky path in a N. Easterly direction, we came to 2 or 3 solitary huts and then turned S.W. over what may be called the first plateau of this part of Lebanon. It is . however, not level, but gradually rising to the S.AA''. and bordered on the S.E. side by the summits of the first lower range, which we had now ascended.

The plain is shut in on all sides1). Not far N. ofthe pool, and close by the earthen hovels of some shepherds we pitched our tent at 5* 15'. Off at 61' 35 . Ascending the pass which shuts in the Merj Ahin on the S.AV. side (a mountain-saddle covered with pines and cypresses) , we came at 71' 30' to another plain, more elevated , narrower and less picturesque than the for- mer , but still having some similarity with it. It is called Merj el-Ahmar. Our path led over its whole length with a S.AVesterly course and having the high snow-top of Jebel Miskiyeh in front, a little to the right. The Merj el-Ahmar has about 30' breadth: its surface presents a layer of coarse limestone-gravel , and is not watered Hke the Merj Ahin ; but in its centre I saw several smad ponds and wells surrounded by stone drinking-troughs and ruins of buddings ; near these the Merj has a fine grassy carpet, on which cattle were feeding. Reaching the end of Merj el-Ahmar at S1' 30' we now skirted the upper base of the high cone of Jebel Miskiyeh , being at the same time shut in on the left by the tops of the lower ranges. The cypresses yet continued, but large fields of snow on ad sides shewed our great elevation, At 9'1 35' we passed by a pool formed by the melting of the snow and surrounded by a fine border of grass. Its water ran off through our now barren rocky valley as a brook of considerable size, receiving in addition several rills from the high snowy summits on the AVest. These summits form a sort of Southern spur from Jebel Miskiyeh. At \\0h 45' we came near the Southern opening of our valley. Here the stream was restrained by an embankment, and led off to the S.E., down a precipitous gorge, in which it was joined by another stream from a spring, which we passed at ll'1; these waters, thus united , form a succession of cascades running down to the village of Nebha , far away in the Bu ka'a towards Sha'ad, where they are used up in irrigation.

At l'1 p. m. the zigzag -path. from 'Ainat came up to join the one we followed, and, passing again several snow-patches, we arrived at I1' 50' at the top of the pass. The view hence towards the West surpasses all imagination in grandeur and beauty, as the eye looks down upon the gigantic cleft of the Nahr Kadisha and its world of rocks around it, the whole tinted by the blue haze of distance ; whilst the stid paler blue of the Ocean loses itself in the colourless vault of heaven, so as to make the horizon completely disappear.

They were taken when, on an excur- sion to Rum, I was accompanied by Mr. W. Thomson , and, when travelling from Caesarea to the ruins of Megiddo, by the Rev. Dr. R. Kalley, both gentlemen having Aneroids with them'). \u2014 On some occasions I could judge pretty nearly about the elevation of places by the known altitudes of surrounding points. Such estimations may be of value as long as no more accurate measurements are made. They are indicated in our list by the word about. In order to appreciate the degree of accuracy of these elevations. it wdl be necessary to consider : 1 . There is in general a great difference between the elevations of one and the same place as given by different traveders. \u2014 This may be partly owing to the observations of the barometer not baving been taken at the same spots. So, for instance, Zahleh is given by Russegger at 3090 and by Allen at 3664 ; Hebron by Russegger at 3029' and by von Schubert at 2840', without it being known at which precise spots in Zahleh or Hebron the measurements were taken. There may, therefore, be a greater correspondence in these elevations, than at the first glance it would seem. But stid, when making allowance for this , there remain too great discrepancies between the altitudes as given by different traveders to view them with equal trust. AVhere the ordinary mountain-barometer has been used, as by Dr. Erdl (v. Schubert), Russegger, DeBertou and von AVildenbruch, there was a want of corresponding simultaneous observations at a given station at the sea-shore , and no details are known as to the influential circumstances under which the observations were made. The same may be said of the Aneroid-barometer mea- surements of the Rev. Dr. De Forest and the Rev. /. L. Porter : and only Capt. Allen informs us of the state of his Aneroid and the conditions under which his observations were taken, conditions the influence of which cannot, through want of corresponding- observations at the sea-level, be corrected. 2. AVe gather nevertheless from among so many diverging datas certain positions, which may be considered as accurate ; such are those on which different travellers seem pretty well to agree ; and among these elevations it is satisfactory to number some of the most important places of the land , as the Cedars in Mount Lebanon , the Pass in Antilebanon on the Beirut-Damascus road near Zebedany. Mount Tabor, Nabulus, Hebron, &C. AVhere- ever there exists some degree of correspondence between the ') Narrative I, p. 97 aud 352"], [180, "168 observations of various travellers we have given in our list the mean of such observations ; but we have given the preference to either Russegger's, von Schubert's or some other traveller's ele vations, when we found occasion from our own experience to esteem them more accurate, than a mean result from the measurements of two. three or more travellers, who show much discrepancy. 3. The depressed valley of the Jordan and basin of the Dead Sea may be caded the great hypsometrical question of Palestine. Special care has by several travellers been bestowed upon the ascertain- ment of the remarkable levels in this region ; and consequently the level of the Sea of Tiberias, several points in the great valley of the Jordan and the level of the Dead Sea ascertained by the expedition of Lieut. Lynch and corroborated by the triangulations of Lieut. Symonds , the measurements of Count de Bertou and others may be considered as quite accurate1). 4. We notice further that Lieut. Symonds' and Lieut. Lynch's ele- vations have been given in our list in preference to those of other travellers, as obtained by more complete and more careful observations. 5. Russegger's measurements generally give higher elevations, than those of other travellers. They were taken with care and may be relied upon with more safety perhaps, than those of Dr. Erdl von Schubert) , De Bertou and von AA'ddenbruch . AVhen making a small allowance for too heigh, where they differ much from other measurements, they will be brought very near to the exact elevation. AATiere the mean of Russegger's and von Schu- bert's elevations are given, there remains not much scope for doubting the correctness of such numbers. 6. von Schubert's observations by Dr. Erdl have given more uncertain results : they show generally too little elevation , but sometimes ') Some error seems to have found its way into Lieut. Symonds' triangu lation, as he finds for the level of Lake Tiberias only \u2014 328,98' (see Calcu lation of triangulation&c.), whilst the barometrical observations of Russegger, De Bertou, Allen, von AVildenbruch and Lynch all show a depression of at least the double of that figure. AVe have accepted the depression given by Lynch , as being the result of observations made under the most favourable circumstances. Dr. E. Robinson (in Journal of the R. Geogr. Soe. of London, vol. 18, p. 77 &c.) has drawn attention to the discrepancies between Lieut. Symonds' triangulation -level and the depression as obtained by barometer ; but he has gone too far in throwing doubts upon the value of Lieut. Symonds' operations in general (see also A. Petermann on the fall of the Jordan &c., in Journal of the R. G. S. of London vol. 18, p. 89\u2014 104). The subsequent observations of Lieut. Lynch's expedition at the Dead Sea have sufSicieiitly proved the worth of Symonds' triangulation, notwithstanding the error in the level ofthe Galilean Sea."], [181, "169 are also far above the mark of other travellers. His barometer acted well during the journey and was brought back to Munich in perfect order. The measurements were duly corrected for errors in the scale, &c; but their value, however excellent otherwi.-e, has greatly suffered from want of simultaneous corresponding observations i). 7 . The same must be observed with reference to count De Bertou's elevations. Their value has perhaps been too lightly esteemed by Capt. Caillier and M. Letronne in Bulletin de la Soc. de Geogr. de Paris quoted above. At least De Bertou's depression of the Dead Sea, the great result of his observations, has in later years been found to come very near the depression of Lieut\" Symonds and Lynch. The height of his barometer at Beirut, on the sea-shore was estimated at 28 inches or 757,96 mil. met. and served as base to all his calculations2). In general Dc Bertou's elevations are below those of other travellers. 8. Col. von AVddenbruch's elevations are also generady too low. A few instances occur, however, where his measurements give far higher numbers, than those of other travellers. The observations were partly taken by barometer and corrected from corresponding observations taken at Beirut. Subsequent observations, and amongst others those on the road from Beirut to Damascus in 1846, were made with the hypsometer of'Eckling (Vienna), with simultaneous observations at Beirut, at 8 a. ni., at noon and at 5 p. m. The measurements taken by the latter instrument show ad a higher result than those taken by barometer (see Notes on the physical Geography of Palestine extracted from letters of Col. von AATddenbruch by A. Petermann , read before the R. Geogr. Society of London 25. June 1849). 9. Capt. Allen gives along with his table of elevations a fair state- ment of the condition of his Aneroid-barometer and of the circumstances attendant upon his observations. The instrument ..had to go thro' a great deal of hard service , in crossing the Lebanon - mountains by several routes , and through Palestine\" and ..its constitution was doubtless impaired.) by galloping to overtake his companions ; \u00abbut it suffered no great derangement untd its services were no longer required ,!)\u00bb.

But corrections for temperature could not be made and ..the distance being in some instances more than 100 miles, it cannot be presumed , that the pressure was always the same at those distant places. The thermometer attached to the instru ment was also out of order from the first, so that complete nota tions could not be made... Capt. Allen, therefore, considers his elevations as approximations only1). A comparison with the other measurements shows in fact here and there great discre pancies ; but in other cases, where the circumstances of obser vation seem to have been more favourable, we find valuable agreement. Capt. Aden's observations, as compared with those of others, give generally too much elevation. 10. Mr. Poole has furnished us with a list of Altitudes taken by Aneroid Metallique, which show a fine agreement with the level- lings of Lynch and Symonds so far as regards the depression of the Dead Sea ; but there is a great discrepancy between his observations and those of other travellers at Jerusalem and elsewhere. The latter may, therefore, be considered as less correct than his Dead Sea measurements. M. Poole's elevations are generally below the figures of others. 11.

From Ba'albek we had very little descent towards the middle (or lowest part) of the Plain in a N. Westerly direction for about an hour , and then again a slow but continual ascent for more than 2% hours before we came to the watershed. Dr Robinson (Later Bibl. Researches p. 531, 532) in his last journey 1.852 kept on the higher road to Lebweh East of the watershed , which he there fore could not make out. He quotes the route fodowed by Dr De Forest (the same which we went), who speaks of the watershed as South of the village of Sha'ad, which to the learned traveller remained unknown. The water shed is not South, but N.E. of Sha'ad, at about 2 mdes distance. The position of both has been laid down in our Map with accuracy. The first waters, which run North ward down the Buka'a are those of the charming fountain near the village of Ras el-Hadeth. They join a temporary little stream from the high mountains to the S.E. and are carried off N. Westward for irrigation. A rising ground to the N.AV. of this spring and to the N.E. of Sha'ad seemed to me to form the highest part of the Great Plain, properly speaking.

The N. el-Kelb is approached by a path leading over the rocks which form the Southern promontory of the river's mouth. The bridge over the river is a short distance to the right or stream upward. A striking feature on the opposite (N.) side of the bridge is a high arched aqueduct, by which the water of the river is carried round the Northern rocky bank to the plain of Juneh. The river is usually ford able. The scenery, looking up the gorge of the stream, is very grand.

The route , as we give it from Afka to Neba' el-Asal according to our itinerary, is the shortest, but perhaps the most difficult. In reaching the top of the ridge (what we have termed oseeond ascent.*). which required the firmest nerves to attain, the main ridge of Lebanon is actuady crossed to the S.

AArestern branches of the Litany. The view of the Buka'a is, however, shut out by a ridge, which, judging from the snow-patches on its top , must be nearly as high as the one just crossed, and seemingly forming the Northern link between Jeb. Sunnin and the lofty crests above Afka and 'Akurah. The route which Robinson followed, passed more to the West of the ridge, where we had our \"Second ascent.). In passing the AVestern spur of this ridge, he calls his ascent \"long and wearisome, but not particularly difficult.\" He descended from it in the then dry AVady Shabruh2) and came down that vadey to the great semicircular rock-basin of the Nahr el-Kelb, in which the Neba' el-Asal and Neba' el-Leben burst forth.

A second route leads from Kefr Nebrakh up the central ridge S. E. of el-Baruk and down byKefareiya and Jubb-Jenin toKamid el-Lauz.

At the end of the Sidon-gardens the little Nahr el-Kcmleh is crossed, and here the first hills are ascended.

The country rises graduady and the hill-sides present everywhere rich cultivation. At Kefr Felus the mountain-scenery properly speaking begins.

On comparing this itinerary with the routes of other travellers, it would seem that Capt. Newbold travelled from Akka to Ras en-Nakura at a rather quickened pace, which the level-road would permit him to do. \u2014 Maundrell (22 March 1637) was S'/2 hours from Ras el-' Am to 'Akka (or 91' 25' from Tyre)."], [232, "220 with tbe ruins of a bridge, at 30' from Ras el-' Ain ; and the other, Shiberiyeh (Thrupp asserts positively : Eisariyeh) of greater extent than the former, at 15' N. of the promontory. Midway between these ruins the bed of the great AVady Asiyeh is crossed. Ras el-Abiad and Ras en-Nakura are both ascended by steps cut out in the rock. Hence perhaps that Ras en-Nakura has been con founded with the former in being erroneously identified with the Lad der of Tyre (Scala Tyriorum) . The pass of Ras el-Abiad is the most difficult of the two ; but the road is cut out, in an excellent manner. On the summit it goes along the precipice , being in general from 1 2 to 15 feet in breadth, and is walled in toward the Sea, a necessary precaution to render it perfectly safe. On the summit of each of these promontories stands a ruined tower ; the one on Ras en-Nakura is now converted into a small Khan. A wretched Khan on Ras el-Abiad is called Khan el-Khamrah ; close to it is a fountain. ') Khan en-Nakura has excellent water and beautiful gardens. Here or on the top of Ras en-Nakura a toll used formerly to be paid. The first sight from Ras en-Nakiira of the plain of 'Akka and its surrounding hills is as surprising as beautiful. 2S. From Tyre to Damascus Whether the ancient high-way from Tyre to Damascus went by Banias , and in which manner Banias was reached across the high hills of BeladBesharah, we are unable to decide. AA'dson's map (Lands of the Bible) has a high-road marked from Tyre to Banias , but seem ingly without authority. Zimmermann's Map of Galilee (edition of 1S55) gives a route from Tyre to Banias by Kid'at Martin .across AVady Hajeir and joining the Sidon-Banias road after descending the mountains between Kadeisa and Hunin. But the respective positions of these places being quite erroneous in his map, the route thus laid down gives us no light. A convenient route may, however , be taken by the Jisr Khardeli with the following distances : From Tyre to the bridge over the N. el-Kasimiyeh 1\" 40' hence to Yesiri 35 Rezieh 40 - Zerariyeh 45 Kuseibeh | 35 - opposite Athshith _ 45 Meifediin _ 40 - Jisr el-Khardeli 1 45 - Hasbeiya (Route HI) 4 3 thus from Tyre to Hasbeiya2) 12'' 28' ') De Sauley, Journey ftc.

From Jisr Khardeli to Kamid cl-Lauz is about 10 hours. After crossing the Kasimiyeh-bridge the prospect' up the wild ravine of this river becomes particularly beautiful.

It formed the direct communication between Damascus and Bozrah, a distance (by Kesweh) of about 23 hours. At the present time the Lejah is avoided as much as possible , because of the fanatical Moslem inhabitants 2) : it is ge- nerally skirted on its E. side, as far as Shuhba, whence choice may be made to proceed to Busrah, either by Kiinawat, Suweideh and 'Ary, or by joining the ancient high-road at Tell ed-Dubbeh.

The distances which we know on these roads from Porter, when compared with Seetzen, Burckhardt and Buckingham, shew great discrepancy. This may be owing to their different rate of travelling ; but must also be attributed to the imperfect state of their notes, which Seetzen and Burckhardt were not spared to lay before, the public them- selves. 2) A serious instance of their brutality was experienced by M.

At the Jebel Aswad the trap-formation begins, for which the Ha'uran-plain is so remarkable. To the N. W. of this mountain-ridge all is white cretaceous limestone, whdst to the S. and S. E. the whole country is one unbroken plain of black lava. The valley of the 'Awaj with its verdant meadows and blooming orchards forms a beau- tiful contrast with the dreary, barren plain, which here commences and which seems to continue Southward without end. The view of the 'Awaj-vadey from Nejha is particularly striking. Burak is the first of a series of vidages ad containing ruins of former villages or towns, some of which are of great extent and beauty. Burckhardt has given a vast amount of particulars about these, and Porter's account of his Ha'uran -tour adds much valuable information. To their volumes we must content ourselves to refer. Seetzen's Reise and Buckingham's Travels among the Arab tribes have also each their worth for this region, especiady Seetzen; but these works contain along with valuable matter much, that is calculated to create confusion. Between Shuhbah and Kunawat the scenery of the Jebel Ha'uran is very fine. Everywhere in their central and Southern parts these mountains are richly clothed with forests of evergreen oaks and other brushwood. The N. parts on the contrary are naked, but the want of trees is here compensated by the extreme fertility of the sod.

The ascent to Saris and more so yet the road between that place and Kuriet el-'Enab is exceedingly rough and stony. At about 20 beyond Kuriet el-'Enab (also called Abii Ghaush or Ghosh from it having been long the residence of the robber-chief of that name) Beit Na kubeh 2) is passed on the left hand side upon a hill above the road.

Two thirds of the way down is a smad fountain on the S. side of the road called Bir 'Arbar. The waterbed of the valley is crossed by a modern bridge with pointed arches , near which stands the ruin of a quadrangular building of great antiquity. The path ascends imme- diately a narrow rocky side-valley, which leads to the high undulating table-land N.AV. of Jerusalem. Intervening rocky sweds , however, shut out the view of the city as yet, and not before within 20' distance its walls and domes and minarets , and the Mount of Olives rising above them become visible. The hills, on which Jerusalem is built, have a general decimation towards the East, and hence the high wall on the N.AA7. side of the town hides a great part of the city.

The road hence ascends the hill, at tlie foot of which the village stands, to Bir Zeit. Traces of the old Roman road are here visible. The view from the brow of this hill overlooks the whole Western de clivity of the mountains quite to the plain. This declivity is composed of a number of eminences , between Avhich no distinct wadies are formed.

XXVI, 1856, p. 58 \u2014 69, as confirming previous observations of other travellers, or bringing to light new and interesting facts, are here shortly inserted. In Oct. 1855 Mr. Poole made arrangements with Abu Dahiik, the principal shekh of the Jehalm-tribe '), now occupying the hills and plains on the AV. side of the Dead Sea, for an escort which was not to exceed 12 men, at 10 piasters each per diem, and 20 piasters per diem for himself and horse. He went from Hebron by Kiirmul to ez-Zuweirah, along the E. side of Jebel Usdiim to explore the Peninsula on the S.E. side of the Dead Sea ; returned to Jebel Usdum and followed the whole AArestern coast of the lake to Jericho. \u2014 A number of altitudes were taken by- Aneroid2), which seem to deserve much confidence as corresponding in the instance of the Dead Sea level perfectly with those of Lieut' Symonds and Lynch. The line of driftwood was at that time 4 feet above the level of the water. 3) The water at the S. end of the Dead Sea was found to be more saturated with brine than at the N. end 5). ') Narrative, &c. II, 85. 2) See chapter of Elevations. 3) Robinson and Smith saw at the S. end of the Dead Sea traces of the highest water-mark , indicating that its level must be at times 1 0 or 1 5 feet higher, than when thev visited this region in the beginning of May (Bibl Res n, 225.) \") The same observation was made by Dr. Anderson in his Geological Report (Lynch's Off. Report p. 204, 205). The following is his analysis ofthe Dead Sea water by J. C. Booth and A. Muckle: With specific gravity ut l.u\" = 1,227422 chloride of magnesium .... 145,8971 - calcium 31,0746 - sodium .... 7S,5537 - potassium .... 6,5860 bromide of potassium .... 1,3741 sulphate of lime 0,7012 261,1816 water . 735,8133 1000,0000 Total amount of solid matter found by experiment 267,0000 nit may be remarked\", says Dr. Anderson, ..that the great specific gravity of this water does not indicate full saturation with any of the chlorides , for the water is still capable of holding much chloride of sodium , and, of course, still more chloride in solution. Since, however, crvstals of sodium remain undissolved at the depth of 1 16 fathoms, it follows that the water of the Dead Sea is very unequally charged with its constituents , and that no safe inference can be drawn from an analysis of the surface-water , and still less of any specimen in which the depth is not given. I will also add, that in two analyses of Dead Sea- water for chloride of calcium alone, I have found more of this salt, than in"], [267, "255 Whereas Lieut. Lynch's expedition had some of the water of the Dead Sea subjected to a powerful microscope, and no animalcules or vestige of animal matter could be detected') Mr. Poole offers evi dences to the contrary.

Of the vast number of travellers who yearly visit the Holy Land, there are few who deviate from a certain beaten track. A tour through Palestine has in consequence become monotonous from its regularity. Interpreters, servants, muleteers have all been accustomed to a certain routine, and it is not without some difficulty that the tourist can get them to change the ordinary road, which, although leading to the greater number of places of Biblical interest, nevertheless leaves many other remarkable sites unnoticed, and certainly the most picturesque spots of this beautiful land unseen. A\\re would, therefore, recommend a new and more satisfactory route, which will open up to the traveller scenes of grandeur and magnificence, such as are only to be found in the Holy Land. AAre trust our suggestions wid be welcome and found useful. AVe here present the outline of a journey through Palestine in the briefest manner possible, whilst the accompanying Map and the dif ferent chapters of this Memoir furnish ample particulars for fiding up our sketch. A point which ought in the first place to be well settled is the time to be consecrated for such a tour. The general fault of tourists, especially those of little experience, is endeavouring to go over too much ground in too short a time, and consequently seeing many places but nothing well. This remark is peculiarly applicable to Palestine, a land comparatively speaking far away, and where climate, hardships, and a thousand other circumstances seem to unite in order to hurry the traveller through the country as fast as possible. For this reason we strongly recommend those, who intend visiting Palestine, not to include Egypt in their tour, nor proceed to Jerusalem via the Arabian desert. Such might indeed be a successful route where the time devoted to Palestine is short, and where a visit to that country is to be merely casual. But where the Holy Land, properly speaking, is to be the object of research, the Nde, the pyramids, the cataracts and many other attrac- tions of Egypt, the long and wearisome camel-journey through the scorch- ing deserts of Sinai and Paran should be given up, in order to arrive in Palestine with one's whole amount of strength, both mental and phy s ical unimpaired. We know that some few travellers have been able to go over Egypt, the Desert and the greater part of Palestine, in a single journey ; but these cases are exceptional : whilst we have known of other tourists, who on their arrival at Jerusalem were so knocked up by the disagreeable motion of the camel and the intense heat of the 17*"], [272, "260 Desert, that they could only half appreciate the Holy City and the in teresting localities in its environs, and were still less gratified with the continuation of their journey, tdl worn out with fatigue, they looked forward to the day of their departure, as the happiest of the whole tour. Others again, better able to stand an Arabian sun and camel-travelling, but not having many weeks at their disposal, found, on arriving at Jerusalem about Easter, that their time was far spent and the Syrian hot summer-season rapidly advancing ; hurrying, there fore, over a portion of Palestine, during four or six weeks, they had to embark again, their time being up, or being caded home by claims and reasons of various kind. Should time not be pressing, we would recommend the tourist to leave for the Holy Land in the latter part of autumn, in order to spend the winter at Jerusalem , where comfortable lodgings may be had, Christian society enjoyed and perhaps sufficient of Arabic learned to dispense with an interpreter afterwards. In such a case a point of great importance is gained, as the traveller will then enjoy the power to do as he likes and go where he pleases. A servant who understands a little of either English, French, German or Italian, and a master understanding a little Arabic may travel a great way in Syria. While thus comfortably quartered at Jerusalem, there will be all the quiet opportunities of visiting those particular localities endeared by their sacred associations. His steps will not be hurried while me ditating in solitude under the olive -groves ofthe Kedron valley; no swarms of pilgrims wid crowd around him in Jerusalem's streets ; no fierce sun hinder his walks over the Mount of Olives' brow. Be sides, the weather, though often stormy and severe, has its breaks of heaven's own blue and a genial sun : in January there are generally some fine days or weeks in succession, when the ..early rains\u00bb have past and the ..latter rains\u00bb not yet began. These are days or weeks which will allow excursions to Bethlehem, Hebron, the Dead Sea and the ancient country of the Philistines And, indeed, no season of the year is so wed calculated for such excursions as just the winter inter val of fine weather, when the sun is not too hot in these Southern parts, especially in the plains, and yet the temperature of the air not too cold to make travelling uncomfortable. Coining back to our lodgings from such excursions, a few days of rest and repose will be welcome and prepare us tbe better for the journey Northward ; and at the time when the storms of spring have past and when the ground is clothed with verdure and flowers , we bid adieu to the earthly Jerusalem , tra velling onward and pitching our tent wherever we choose. Supposing that the Holy City is left in the beginning of April, six weeks of de lightful spring- weather will then be enjoyed, disturbed only now and then by a sirocco, from which there is no escape. The weather about the I 5\"' of May becomes very hot; but as by this time the high regions of Jebel Rihan (the Southern part of Lebanon) are reached, thetraveder"], [273, "261 escapes here the intensity of heat. The crossing of the plain of Coele syria and the barren chalky hills of Antilebanon, in order -to visit Da mascus, may expose us yet to a fierce glare ; but this is of short dura tion , and the wooded crests and snowy tops of Northern Lebanon will in this season afford us the highest gratification which the visible works of God can give, tdl we reach Beirut, the end of our journey. AVhen there is, however, no time at the traveller's disposal for wintering in Jerusalem, and when instead of six he can only devote three months to his visit of Palestine, we would recommend him to choose March, April and May for this object. He may in that case have occasionady to shelter in the uninviting dwellings of the natives, when showers and storms prevent him to pitch his tent ; but fine weather wid accompany him most of the time, and he wdl see the country in its bridal costume of green and flowers. September, October and November are sometimes chosen for a tour; but besides the disadvantage of very hot days in September and even in October, the face of the country is then all burned up, the harvest has long since past, and hids and vadeys present, instead of verdant fields, nothing but the monotonous yellow or grey natural to the rock. The summer ought decidedly to be avoided. The intense heat of a Syrian sun reflected from rocks and roads has been fatal to many a Holy Land-traveller, and those who can stand it best will even find, that it makes traveding more a tod than a pleasure. There is a choice of steamers up the Mediterranean in order to reach the Syrian coast ; but we would recommend the one which leaves Marseides two or three times a month for Malta, Syra, Smyrna and Beirut, or for Malta, Alexandria and Yafa. The Smyrna route should be taken when it is known that traveders coming from Egypt are subject to quarantine at Yafa or Beirut, as the Lazarettos in Syria are more than elsewhere in the Levant filthy and swarming with vermin. Tra vellers from Smyrna are in the ordinary course of things not subjected to quarantine in Syria. On returning home the Austrian steamers via Smyrna and Corfu to Trieste are to be preferred to the Marsedles line, because they land the traveller at a convenient point, whence, if hurried, he may take the radway to A'ienna, Dresden and Cologne, or, if not, the steamer from Trieste to ATenice \u2014 a voyage only of six hours in fine weather \u2014 whence a railway carries him by A'erona and Mdan to the beautiful shores of the lake of Como. Continuing then his route over the glorious pass of Splugen, or crossing the Alps from the Lago Maggiore by the not less magnificent passes of the S' Got hard or Simplon, he wid feel the benefit of the pure and invigorating mountain air, which perhaps is never so welcome as when coming from the glow and glare of a Syrian sun. A point which we leave visitors to the Holy Land to settle for them selves, is the expense of the journey. There is such a wide difference between the wants of one traveder and those of another, that it seems"], [274, "262 impossible to calculate it with any thing like certainty. On comparing, for instance, Dr. Titus Tobler' s list of expenses, published in his de tailed volumes on Jerusalem, with the figures of Dr. Stewart (The tent and the khan, p. 3), it wid at once strike the reader, that he is left to consult his own taste and means, and to decide for himself. AVe will only briefly notice that, whilst enjoyment may be doubled by travelling with one or two or even three companions, the expenses of the journey in Palestine by such an arrangement wid be greatly reduced. One tent, one canteen, one dragoman, one set of servants or attendants, will do for two or three as well as for one traveller. Often when *>backshish\u00bb (fee or present) has to be paid \u2014 and this is without end \u2014 one backslash again serves equally for one as for three, &c. AVe need not dwell upon the importance of the right choice of one's traveding companions ; but it may not be superfluous to hint at the advantage of making ad arrangements of this kind at home if pos sible, not trusting to chance, to furnish us with suitable fedow-tra vellers. AVe have rarely met with travellers provided with a \u00abFirman\u00bb from the Sovereign of the Ottoman empire ; and, indeed, for ordinary Pales tine-travelling this is superfluous. At the same time we have found on various occasions the benefit of a firman ; and when the tra veder's object is to visit the interesting out of the way places of the land, we would recommend him to apply for such a document. It can easily be procured by writing from Smyrna or Alexandria to the Am bassador at Constantinople. The delay caused thereby is veiy short, as steamers go up and down frequently ; besides, these cities are worthy of being seen with something more than a hasty glance. In addition to the firman it is usual that at Smyrna, Alexandria, Beirut, 'Akka, Jeru salem and Damascus a <(Tezkirah\u00bb or second rate sort of passport is procured from the resident Pasha Letters of recommendation from the higher or lesser authorities in Palestine to the shekhs of different villages which the traveller wishes to visit are never superfluous ; often they are quite necessary in order to pass unmolested and with ease through districts rarely visited by Europeans, or to obtain armed guides which serve as an official protection. As a fixed rule the tra veller should always place himself as much as possible under the pro tection of the government authorities, who are thus made directly re sponsible for his safety. The necessary articles required for travelling in Palestine, such as tent , canteen , folding-bedstead , folding-stools and table, bedding, Turkish rug or carpet, &c, can all be procured in Alexandria, Smyrna, or Beirut ; in the two first named towns new, in the latter second hand, as these artioles are generally there disposed of by travellers at the end of their journey. A good saddle should be brought to Palestine, either from Malta, Smyrna or Alexandria, the market in Palestine"], [275, "263 for this piece of equipment being not so well furnished. For bedding a thick, large sized \u00abLehaf\u00bb or stuffed blanket, which may serve as a matrass when doubled up, and a smaller thin one for a cover, will prove quite satisfactory. They should be rolled up in a large piece of painted canvas, which will preserve them when travelling during the day, and serve at the same time at night as a floor -cover in the tent. A bedstead will prove very useful wherever there is dampness of the ground to be feared ; in hot weather and on a sandy or rocky level the Turkish carpet offers a cooler and more pleasant couch to lie upon than the bedstead. A revolver is to be recommended : not so much because it will be required, as to inspire the natives with proper respect. The author took with him no weapons whatever, thinking it more judicious to show no distrust, where it was necessary to obtain the good will of the people, in order to secure their assistance in his geographical re searches. Yet had he more than once occasion to notice, that the show of a revolver would probably have saved him from impudent behaviour or other annoyance. This article, as also a telescope and large sized pocket-compass, should be purchased at home. Those who wish to add to the geographical knowledge of Palestine by their tour, should procure a nboussole d'arpentage\u00bb at Marseilles. An Aneroid-barometer will also prove a useful and not encumbering instrument. Many books are only a useless weight, as there is seldom or ever an opportunity for reading. The traveller should, if possible, prepare himself with ex tracts from authors on those points which he wishes to examine par ticularly. Impressions and observations independent from those of former traveders have their own value, a value which sometimes is overrated, but which may be underrated also. There are at present in the Library of the Literary Society and in the Reading-room of the Church of England Mission at Jerusalem opportunities for consulting a number of authors upon the Holy Land. If the traveller has six months at his disposal and falls in with our suggestion of spending his winter in Jerusalem, we would recommend him to land at Beirut, in preference to Yafa, as the former is the best place in Syria to find the necessaries for his journey through the length and breadth of the country. He ought, however, not to pur chase a tent, as the season would be now too far gone to make use of it, and it wid only increase his expenses for mules to carry it to Jeru salem ; whilst in spring, at the departure of the pilgrims, he will have no difficulty in finding a second hand one in that city. Should he already have procured a tent at Alexandria, he may then send it by steamer to Yafa, where he wid find it on his way to Jerusalem. Commencing his travels at Beirut will also afford him the opportunity of a journey South to Jerusalem along a route different from the one he will follow when in the spring he returns from Jerusalem to Lebanon. A horse shoidd be purchased at Beirut; also a servant hired, if"], [276, "264 possible, one who understands a language familiar to his master, who then may dispense with a dragoman, otherwise the most ne cessary person of his train, but often also the source of his greatest annoyance. If, however, at Beirut a dragoman must be taken, he should be only hired as far as Jerusalem , and on condition that the traveder, not the dragoman, is to provide all the necessaries for the journey. Travellers often put themselves into the hands of a dra goman with the bargain, that he is to provide for every thing, bedding, mules, tent, provisions, &c. The charges made in such a case are \u00a3 1 and upwards per day for each person. This arrangement for tra veding is not only more expensive than the other, \u2014 a dragoman's charge being in the former case \u00a3 6 or \u00a3 7 per month, besides the ex pense of his horse and his living \u2014 but it makes the traveller a perfect slave to his dragoman whom he leads according to his good pleasure. It is needless to say, how such a method impedes the ex ploring inclinations of the traveller. In procuring at Beirut attendants, horses and further requisites for the journey, the kind assistance of European residents or of a con sul should, if it can be obtained, in no wise be overlooked. The bar gain for mules is in Beirut far easier and cheaper than in Jerusalem. Unless in a time of great demand, when there is an arrival of a vast number of travellers by one steamer, the price for mules at Beirut is usuady ten piasters for each travelling-day, and the half of that sum for each day when at rest. For small distances, for instance from Beirut to Sidon, the return must also be paid; but not in going to any of those chief stations of travellers as Damascus, Jerusalem, &c, whence the muleteers are sure to find a return charge. The first start is one accompanied by much quarreding and voci ferating between dragoman, servants, muleteers and often even the by-standers who never fail to gather round. It is always later than the hour fixed upon for the departure , that of early morning ; but once fairly off things go on better and continue to do so during the subsequent days. The first day's journey from Beirut is frequently taken only as far as Khan Naby Yunas. This suits ad parties : de tained by a hundred reasons, the little caravan rarely sets in motion till late, too late often to reach Sidon that same day ; and it is well also to begin a succession of travelling-days by small distances, in order not to consume one's strength at the outset. The khan at Naby Yiinas has two rooms where travellers find shelter for the night. Here the first sad acquaintance is made with the filthy dwellings of Palestine and their numberless troublesome vermin. Next morning an early start will enable the traveder, after three hours ride, to breakfast under the last few autumnal leaves which over shadow the Mohammedan burial-ground outside of the East -wall of Sidon, if he pitches his tent, or if not, in the so called French Khan within the town. The day may be profitably spent in a ride through"], [277, "265 the luxuriant gardens and over the hills immediately East and N. E. of Sidon, whence the best view of the city on the land-side may be obtained1). By applying with either firman or tezkirah to the gover nor, the gate of the old ruined land -castle on the S. side ofthe town will be opened and, after inspection of the ancient fortress, a fine view over the surrounding country enjoyed. In the afternoon a boat may be hired to inspect the traces of the old Phoenician port on the rocks projecting from the town as islets in a N. Westerly direction into the sea. Another day's journey along the coast and past the site of ancient Sarepta brings the traveder to Tyre. Here he should stop a day (there is a oLoeandai*, or sort of Hotel), and ride out early to see Hiram's tomb, going thither by Ramah and visiting on his return the famous reservoirs at Ras el-' Ain. A row in a boat round the AArest-side of Sur wid be found highly interesting for the archeologist, and not less so an examination of the remains on the S. and S.E. side of the town. Native consular agents are found in Saida and Sur. From Sur the journey should not be directly pursued to 'Akka. The distance de mands a hard day's traveding ; but it is not so much on account of this circumstance, as on account of the beautiful vadey and ruined castle of el-Kurn, that we recommend the traveller to make the day's journey from Tyre not further than to the Christian vidage of el-Bus sah, remaining there the night over in the clean and comfortable house of the shekh. Through him a guide wdl be procured from the Fellah tribe, which inhabits the A\\Tady el-Kurn and its vicinity, for an ex cursion to the magnificent and yet almost unknown ruined castle. But before leaving el-Bussah the remains of a city of much splendour, now called Ma'asub, should be visited at only a few minutes distance E.N.E. ofthe village. From Kul'at Kurn his steps should be bent to M'alia, a Christian village, where a good reception from the shekh may be relied on ; and next day 'Akka wid be reached via the large Moslem vdlage of Ter shiha and the ruined castle of Jedin. A view rare for beauty and extent is obtained from the high hid immediately S. of Tershiha crowned with a wely and mosk. At 'Akka a walk over its famous ramparts should not be omitted. This requires the permission of the Pasha, which will be obtained with or without the firman. The ..excellency of Carmel\" is too much referred to in Scripture, and has been too often erroneously taken for a beautiful distant view of that mountain under the effect of a setting sun, for us merely to direct the traveder to visit the famous convent perched on its extreme N. Western brow. In this monastery comfortable board and lodg- ') Le Pays d'lsrael, pi. 7."], [278, "266 ing may be had, and excellent air enjoyed; but the ..excedency of Carmeb. is not to be seen here. That will only strike us when, after having proceeded to Haifa and obtained an armed guide from the governor, we have rounded the convent -cape and ascended Carmel from 'Athlit (ruins which should not be passed by without a visit) and 'Ain Haud. The luxuriant vegetation with which the heights and vaks of Carmel's S. side are covered, and the many traces of an cient walls, which once supported the richest vines, give us the true meaning of the Scriptural expression. From 'Akka , which may be left in the middle of the day , Haifa or the Carmel-convent wid be the next station. Hence a most in teresting day's ride, touching 'Athlit and passing 'Ain Haud, Bistan and Daliyeh, brings to Esfia, a Druze- village on one ofthe highest points of Carmel, with glorious views over all the surrounding country and with safe accommodation for the night. AVith an additional guide from Esfi?, the place called el-Mohraka, the site of Elijah's sacrifice, should be visited next morning. Going down from the .height of Carmeb. to the Kishon-river , by the very ravine by which the prophet led the priests of Baal down to be slain at the stream , the ancient vaulted fountain is passed , whence the water was obtained for the burnt-offering. AAathout, however, going as far down as the Kishon, where the name of a mound. Tell Kasis othe mound of the priests, \u00bb also called Tell Mukata unround of slaughter.), keeps alive the memory of the awful event, a path is followed which branches off to the right a little below the fountain, and leads to the ruin -covered mound el-Kaimiin, the site of ancient Jokneam. The path turns now S.AV., up AArady Milheh along a rivulet, and, skirting the whole of Carmel's Southern base, brings us to the large village of Iksim , where the governor of Haifa has a residence. It lies at the Southern end of a sniall plain surrounded by hills , which shut it out from the large plain along the coast. An opening between these hills covered by a splendid olive-grove leads from Iksim to the coast plain, where the village of Tantura, S. of the ruins of ancient Dor, offers the best , although filthy and miserable quarters for the night. The shortest way hence to Yafa is now the coast-route ; but as this is a most tedious and uninteresting journey , we propose a choice of two other roads by which the Holy City may be reached. Having first visited tbe ruins of Caesarea , we may either go by Kakun to Sebustiyeh (Samaria), hence to Nabulus (Shechem), and by the high road past, Seilun (Shiloh), Beitin (Beth-ell, Bireh (Beeroth) , er-Ram iRamah of Said) and Tided el-Fiil (Gibeah) to Jerusalem; or, reserving this route for a later time, when resuming the journey North, the track by which the Apostle Paul was brought from Jerusalem to Cae sarea - \u2014 a rarely trodden path and, therefore, perhaps all the more in teresting \u2014 may be followed from Caesarea by Kakun, Kefr Saba (Antipatris), Mejdel, or Mejdel Yaba, to Tibneh and Jifna, joining the"], [279, "267 Nabuliis-Jerusalem road at about 20' AVest of Beitin. Kakun, Na biilus and Beitin on the first mentioned route, or Kakun, Mejdel and Abud on the latter offer the best stations for the night. At Nabulus two or three Christians have arranged in their houses upper-rooms in order to lodge European or other travellers. In passing Tibneh a visit to the excavated sepulchres in the hill on the South-side of the ruins mentioned by Eli Smith in Bibl. Sacra IS 13, p. 4S4 should not be omitted. The approach to Jerusalem from the N. side offers the advantage of presenting by far the best distant view of the Holy City, whilst it is not without some measure of disappointment that the traveller sees the high Northwestern city-wads hide the greater part of Jerusalem, when he approaches it by the road from Yafa. The journey from Beirut to Jerusalem will in this manner claim 13 travelling-days. The first day from Beirut to Khan Naby Yunas. second day to Sidon. third day to Tyre. fourth day to el-Bussah. - fifth day to M'alia. sixth day to 'Akka. seventh day to Haifa. eighth day to Esfia. ninth day to Tantura. tenth day to Kakiin. - eleventh day to Mejdel, Abud, or Nabulus. twelfth day to Beitin or Bireh - thirteenth day to Jerusalem. On setting off from Beirut about the end of November or beginning of December, it is not likely that fine weather will continue till Jerusalem be reached. But in the greater part of the above named places two, three or more stormy days may be passed without other discomfort than that of being detained. Generally there follow one or two fine days after the storms, and, making the best of these intervals, Jeru salem may be reached before Christmas. There is in the above route nothing to be feared from snow storms or too severe cold. Along the coast and in the low plains the sun will be found, even in winter, quite hot enough. Furnished lodgings may be had in Jerusalem at a reasonable rate, except in the season when travellers and pilgrims from all parts of tbe globe crowd thither, \u2014 about Easter and the few days or weeks which precede it. AVe had ourselves very pleasant apartments at Mr. Max Ungar's, near the Damascus-gate. The winter-climate in Jerusalem requires fires in the houses ; but cannot even then be called otherwise than very mild. Snow falls rarely and does not remain on the ground."], [280, "268 There is no difficulty in finding teachers of Arabic in the Holy City ; and those who avail themselves of such an opportunity, wdl find, that even two or three months study of the language of the country will be of great advantage when resuming their journey in spring. Some may pick up enough of Arabic to dispense with a dra goman ; whilst others, as we have before observed, will at any rate learn enough to emancipate themselves from being led by their dra goman as he pleases. As long as the weather keeps unsettled with Westerly winds and storms, no excursions to any great distance should be attempted. On the other hand Bethany , Bethlehem , Urtas , Tekoa , the cavern of Khureitum, Frankmountain , the so called wilderness of S' John, the convent of the Cross, &c. , are ad places full of interest , which may be visited in the way of excursions of a single day. When after the first three or four weeks of stormy weather the sky looks clear in the West and the wind shifts to the N.E., there is a chance of a succession of fine days, and a tour to tbe Dead Sea and the country of the South may be safely undertaken. An escort of Bedawin is now necessary. A contract is made for this purpose with shekh Hamdan of the Ta'amirah tribe or with Abu Dahuk the stid more powerful shekh of the Jehalin. The former is generady found encamped in the vicinity of Bethlehem; the latter more to the South. Both may be sent for through one of the Consids at Jerusalem, and the contract made before this authority. Perhaps equally good arrange ments may be made with one of the Bedawin shekhs before and through the governor of Hebron, for whom a special letter from the Pasha at Jerusalem should be obtained. Circumstances must guide the traveller in these matters , and if he can get advice from persons well acquainted with the Bedawin, he should avail himself thereof. In making a bargain with a Bedawin shekh, as well as with all other Arabs, hurry must be avoided , and the traveller should not allow himself to be intimidated by a high demand , supported by a glowing picture of the dangers which have to be encountered and of tbe consequent large number of people which must accompany the traveller. These and many other such like tricks are common among the Arabs and always practised on the inexperienced traveller. A fair price may be considered 10 piasters a day for each Bedawin on foot , something more when on horseback , and double for a shekh and his horse. There is besides a backshish to be added, which may or may not be fixed beforehand; but other presents, such as clothing, arms, &c. , should not be given. Undoubtedly the shekh and his followers, when once started, wid make his attacks on the generosity of the traveller, who may feel tempted to satisfy such claims in order to get rid of the begging; but he may be sure, that the more he opens bis hands , the fiercer he will be besieged by endless de mands. If there is a good store of coffee, sugar and tobacco, this will"], [281, "269 be found a means of keeping one's Bedawin-escort in good humour. More than that makes them only troublesome and impudent. There is certainly much annoyance connected with a journey under the favour of Bedawin company ; but no danger need at all be appre hended in ordinary circumstances, and there is in the children of the Desert a simplicity, and in many of them a faithful attachment, which will not fail to produce a pleasant impression on the traveller's mind. His wanderings among the cheerless mountains along the Dead Sea or the weary desert of Southern Judea will in no wise belong to those of which he carries home an unpleasant recodection. Those who wish to explore the remarkable ruins of AVady Musa, cannot do better than follow Robinson and Smith's example as narrated in their Biblical Re searches. So extensive a journey does not fall within the limits of this sketch. But where the traveder is satisfied with shorter distances, we recommend him to go from Jerusalem by Solomon's pools to Hebron, and to devote at least a day to the examination of the present el- Khulil and the numberless ruin -covered sites in its neighbourhood, explored indeed by A\\Tolcott and others , but by no means in such a manner as not to require further investigation. Supposing that the contract with a Bedawdn shekh is made , wherein all places must be particularly mentioned, which the traveder desires to visit, he may then go by Tell Zif (Ziph) , Kiirmid (Carmel) and Ted Ma'in (Maon) to the famous ruins of Masada, perched on their high and nearly un accessible cliffs on the shore of the Dead Sea. In its vicinity there is more than one place where water is to be found between the rocks in the ravines and where the tent may* be pitched for the night. The tem perature of the air is in these regions so mdd, that the tent is used with the greatest comfort. A second day's journey brings the traveder down the fearfudy steep pass of Zuweirah. At the bottom of the pass, close by the rum of a little castle, water is again found, in a sort of natural reservoir formed by the rocks. Either here or in the smad AVady Nejid, a side-valley of AVady ez-Zuweirah, the tent ought to be pitched, as there is no fresh water further on for a considerable distance. Crossing next morning the gravedy plain N. of Jedel Usdum with its peculiar vegetation of acacias, tamarisks and retem-shrubs , the shore of the Dead Sea is now reached. Jebel Usdum is fodowed along the beach in its whole length , and half an hour or more beyond its Southern point the course is again turned towards the whitish and terribly jagged mountains to the West. The ascent here is even worse than the one of Zuweirah. A little after having reached the top of this pass, water may again be found in the stony bed of AV. el-Em'az. It is hard work to reach Kurnub from Zuweirah in one day ; but by starting early and not losing time on the road it may be done, and the fatigue of the journey wdl then be forgotten at the refreshing abundance of water found in the rocky ravine a few hundred yards below the ruins of Kurnub."], [282, "270 The journey hence by the wells and ruins of 'Ar'arah to Bir es- Seba (Beer Sheba), \u2014 one day \u2014 leads through the desert, which by this time is likely to be clothed with a new carpet of grass and flowers. In such a garment it offers only enjoyment, which is still increased by a most pure and delicious atmosphere. AVe would fain recom mend the traveller to proceed from Beer Sheba to Gaza, but unfortu nately this part of the country has been during the last years the scene of the never ceasing quarrels and fights between different Bedawin tribes, and, as those of shekh Hamdan and Abu Dahiik are involved in these feuds, it is impossible to induce the escorts which they pro cure to venture into districts, where they could no longer be respons able for the safety of th'ir travellers. Our steps must, tl be directed either to Hebron or to Beit- Jibrin. In choosing the latter an easy road, skirting the AVestern base of the high central Judea - hids , wdl be fodowed and the sites of Ramath-Lehi and En-hakore of Samson's history passed. \u2014 The Bedawin escort ought to be dismissed at Hebron or Beit Jibrin. In order to visit as many places of interest as possible in the short est time, the road from Beit-Jibrin should be taken to Gaza by the sites caded 'Ajlan and Um-Lakhis. Another day's travelling will lead from Gaza by the ruins of Askelon to Esdud (Ashdod), and one day more to Yafa ; or, if pressed for time and obliged to give up seeing the city where Peter dwelt with Simon the tanner, and where century after century thousands and thousands of pilgrims have landed on their way to the Holy City, the direct road from Esdud to Ramleh might be taken, in order to reach Jerusalem at the end of another very fatiguing day's journey. AVhen at Ramleh an excursion to the fine ruins of the church of S' George at Ludd (Lydda) l) should not be omitted. The above described tour takes a fortnight if accompdshed without stopping at places otherwise than on the two intervening Sundays. \u2014 It hardly needs to be observed, that by adding another week the ex cursion will be far less fatiguing and far more instructive , as no haste wid then drive the traveller on past many interesting objects and facts, which will be lost to him when hurried over. On leaving Jerusalem for the North we recommend him to begin with the ordinary excursion of the greater number of tourists, to the convent of Mar Saba, the Northern extremity of the Dead Sea, the Pilgrims' bathing-place at the Jordan, and Jericho. The first night is generally spent in the convent ; the second at Jericho. The abuse of traveders has caused the monks of Mar Saba to refuse admittance, except when provided with a letter from the Greek Patriarch at Jeru salem. At the well el-Kulab, some 20' N.AV. of Deir Mar Saba, there is a very good encamping ground. On leaving the shore ofthe Dead Sea the muleteers with the baggage ') Le Pays d'lsrael, pi. 57."], [283, "271 and the servants are often sent on straight to Jericho, in order that when their party comes up thither from the Jordan, these may find their tent already pitched. AVe would strongly recommend the beauti ful woods at the fountain of Elisha ('Ain es - Sultan) as a place for encamping, in preference to the filthy grounds at er-Riha. The dis tance from er-Riha to 'Ain es-Sultan is only half an hour. In making before the Consul at Jerusalem the bargain for the re quired Bedawin escort on this excursion, now fixed at a regular sum, a special condition should be made, that the safe convoy is to guide the traveller from er-Riha to Bethel (Beitin), instead of back to Jeru salem. Thereby a wretched road and an unnecessary detour will be avoided and a very interesting route fodowed , as it is likely , that Joshua led Israel up by this path \u2014 one of easy access \u2014 to the forti fied city of Ai. AVe believe that there is no reasonable ground for doubting the identity of Tell el-Hajar, some 20 N.AV. of DeirDiwiin, with that city. The visit of Tell el-Hajar wid take us not many minutes out of our regular road. When on the journey from Beirut to Jerusalem the route from Caesarea by Mejdel and Tibneh has been followed, the high-way from Beitin to Nabulus will now offer a new and interesting track, touching the ruins of Shiloh about midway. But should the latter road have been chosen on the journey South, we then recommend the traveller to take the course N.E., past 'Ain Yebrud, Deir Jerir and Kefrlstuna, with the interesting ruins of Alexandrium, to Daumeh (Edumia). Here a splendid view is enjoyed of the Ghor and the Surtabeh mountains. If pressed for time, Akrabeh might easily be reached that same day, and after half a day's journey more the city of Nabulus. But when instead of proceeding to Akrabeh the tent is pitched at Daumeh, there wid be just time enough that day to descend the steep and high mountains into -the Ghor and to visit there the fountain and brook Cherith, now called 'Ain Fasad, from Fasad, a tell covered and sur rounded with the ruins of the ancient Fasaelis. A guide from Daumeh to Fasad is required. The people at Daumeh wdl be able to give information how far it would be safe to visit the beautiful oasis of Kerawa in the Ghor, without being accompanied by an official guide from the governor of Nabulus. AVhen the village shekh can be persuaded to act as guide, which implies his responsability for tho traveders' safety, such an ex cursion might be comfortably undertaken. If not, there remains no alternative but to go to Nabulus and ask the governor for a khayal, which wdl be obtained by the firman. The excursion from Nabulus to Kerawa with such a khayal is safe, and, although fatiguing because of the descent to and the hot climate in the Ghor, highly interesting. The road thither forms at the same time the high-way to es-Salt. Traveders who desire to visit the latter place must endeavour to do so either from Nabulus or Jerusalem, accompanied by one ofthe Christians"], [284, "272 of these cities standing in relation to those at es-Salt. AVe possess no information whereby we are enabled to give directions for travelling in the East-Jordan country, beyond the Journals of Seetzen, Burck hardt, Buckingham, Irby and Mangles ; and their accounts are certainly any thing but tempting. The same lawlessness exists as in their days, the same marauding Bedawin tribes rove over the face of the country, and the same continual exposure to annoyance and plunder may be expected now as was the case 40 or 50 years ago. Yet a traveller familiar with Arabic and possessing medical skill might venture among these tribes with some chance of a successful exploration of the land. To those who descend to Kerawa a visit to the neighbouring se pulchral caves in the rocky ridge called el-Makhruk (or Makhriid) and an ascent of Kiirn Surtabeh, the highest peak of the group of that name, is to be recommended; of course, not without being accom panied by a Bedawin guide from the tribe encamped at and tiding the fruitful ground of Kerawa. If anxious to return to Nabulus, the AVady el-Ferrah will offer a charming and picturesque road. From Nabulus the ruins of Samaria are only two hours distant ; hence there is a choice of roads to Jenin : by Sanur, or by Ted Dothan and Burkin. Continuing by a road a little East of the high-way to Naza reth, across the hot plain of Esdraelon, Zer'in (Jizreel), Sulem (Sunem), Nein (Nain) and Endur (Endor) ought to be visited. Should, however, Samaria already have been passed on the former journey South, the traveder may proceed from Kerawa to Tamun and Tubas, falling in here with the ancient high -way from Neapolis to Scythopobs. The village of Yasir may be chosen for the night's encampment; and if time permits to do so, the Jebel Haskin to the N. of Yasir should be ascended, as its summit offers a magnificent and far extending view. From Yasir the shortest way to Beisan is by Wady Khusneh ; but in taking the detour through AVady Maleh, the ruins of the castle of that name may be visited , as also the sites of Succoth and Sadm where John baptized. In applying for a khayal to the governor of Nabulus the names of the places which are to be visited should be mentioned particularly, and letters to the shekhs of those villages, where the night is to be passed or where any services are required, should be asked for. At Beisan the immediate jurisdiction of Nabulus is at an end. The place comes under the Metsedim of Jenin, and we here have to dis miss the khayal. Beisan is now a wretched vidage budt up between the ruins of the ancient Scythopolis '). Its inhabitants are strangers from Egypt and much exposed to the annoyances of the Siikr- (or Sakher) Bedawin, who encamp during a part of the year all over the Eastern section of JizreeTs plain. Consequently traveders are here exposed to the pilfering habits of these Arabs ; and the best way to ') Le Pays d'lsrael, pi. 78."], [285, "273 escape them is not to offer the Bedawin time or temptation by linger ing too long. Yet the high tell of Beisan with its ruins should not be left without a visit. Following the Northern base ofthe Gilboa- Mountains, Zer'in is now passed, and Nazareth reached on the evening of that same day. To visit the summit of Ml Tabor and hence to reach Tiberias, re quires a day's work from Nazareth. A khayal is here necessary, the country being unsafe, and the governor of Tubariyeh too weak or unwilling to exert himself in making this state of things any better. Even the very vicinity of the city is far frL'm being safe. Yet would we prefer to pitch our tent at the side of the sweet waters of the lake outside the town to taking up our short residence in one of the filthy \u2022aLocandas). within. \\ A day spent in visiting the ruins of Magdala, Beth-saida and Ca pernaum will fly away far too swiftly. Another day may be spent in en joying a sail in the only fishing -boat now on the Sea of Gennesareth. AVith regret a visit to the country of the Gadarenes must be given up, as the whole Eastern side of the lake is inhabited by lawless Bedawin, among whom no native of the AVestern coast dares to venture. There fore the journey must be resumed, either direct to Safed via Mejdel and the ruins called Shusheh, at the AVestern border of the Genne sareth-plain up AArady el-Amu.d, called higher up W. Leirmin, or, if anxious to see the ruined church at Sefurieh (Sepphoris) and the ruins of Cana, now Kana el-Jelil, by making a detour to the former, where the traveller has in that case to pitch his tent for the night. The journey from Sefurieh to Safed by Cana, 'Arrabeh, 'Ain Sela meh, Kefr 'Anan and Ferathi is long and fatiguing, but rich in mag nificent views over Southern Galilee and its beautiful lake. The straight line North on leaving Safed is not the way which ought to be followed in order to see the most interesting parts of the country. Should time fail, however, that line wdl take from Safed via 'Alma to Kedesh (Kades) \u2014 with beautiful ancient remains ; then down tbe moun tains to the Huleh plain ; and by the bridge of el-Ghujar across the Nahr Hasbany (the upper Jordan) to Tell el-Kady (Dan) and Banias (Caesarea Philippi), where a day should be spent in visiting the castle, the curious lake Phiala, now Birket er-Ram, and if possible also some of the ruined temples in AA^ady el-'Asal. But he who has time to see a little more of the country once assigned* to the tribes of Asher and Naphtali, will not regret going the first day from Safed by Kefr Bir'im (with fine ruins of a synagogue) to Bint Jebeil; and hence on the second day with a khayal from the governor of that place to the ruins at Haziir, Rameh and Belat ; thence by Surrebin and Haris to Tibnin. Hamed el-Beg, the governor of BeladBesharah, wdl give him a kind reception in his castle , and a khayal to Kill' at Hunin, Tell el- Kady and Banias. Time now again becomes a weighty point of consi deration. AVhere it is short, too short to visit Damascus and Northern v.in .1c Vel.le, Holy Land."], [286, "274 Lebanon, the journey should be taken from Banias to Hasbeiya, via Rasheiya el-Fokhar and Hibariyeh, the latter with fine ruins of a temple. From H&sbeiya past the fountain of the Jordan across the Litany by Jisr Burghur to Kefr Huneh and Jezzin, with a magnificent waterfad, and hence to Deir el-Kamar and Beirut. In this manner he wid leave the country with the most pleasant reeodections of what he last has seen, as the richest cultivation , the most glorious and varied mountain scenery and a healthy looking, civil population are here uniting to make this last part of his journey the most delightful of all '). Yet he whose time permits him to visit both Damascus and Le banon , will enjoy scenery , as well as ruins and remains, in a far greater abundance. He should from Hasbeiya visit the chasm of the Litany , which in ad Syria has nothing equal to it in grandeur and wddness2). \u2014 A guide from Hasbeiya or Dibbin is necessary to take the tourist down the fearful precipices a little S. of Belat, or to con duct him to the narrowest part of the gorge at a place a little further S. caded el-Khatweh. Kuleya might be made the camp-ground for the night, or, if the day is not too far gone, the vidage of Arnun on the Northern high bank of the Litany. The strong and splendidly situated castle of Belfort, now Kid' at esh-Shukif, should not be left unvisited, without, however, lingering long ; for the journey hence down to the charming AVady Jermak, then up this valley and the magnificent wild glen of the upper Zaharany torrent to Jurjua ; after that skirting the densely wooded AATestern cliffs of Jebel Rihan , past Jebeah ; and finally up by Zhalteh to the high situated Jezzin requires a long day's work. \u2014 This route is certainly one of the richest in splendid scenery of ad Lebanon. Jebel Rihan is more wooded than any other part of that mountain-range, and hence its beauty is truly exquisite. It is wed calculated to tell the traveller what a glorious country Palestine must once have been, when it was covered with the choicest blessings of God instead of sighing as it now does under His awful curse. From Jezzin there is a choice of passes over the Lebanon, every one of them offering most magnificent prospects. Those from the pass S. of the Toum Nihas are perhaps the finest, as embracing an inter rupted view over the country to the S. tid even beyond the Lake of Galdee. The road, however, which suits best the route now re commended , continues N. to el-Muktarah , follows then up the left banks of the grand and exquisitely beautiful valley of the N. Baruk till its very beginning , whence a wdd path joins the Beirut - Damascus road, nearly at the top of the pass. This point is considerably N. of Da mascus ; but in bending the steps S.E. towards that capital, two of the chief fountains of the Litany, the Neba Shemsin and Neba 'Anjar, and the fine ruins of a temple near Mejdel 'Anjar may be visited, whilst ') See also Wilson's testimony in Lands of the Bible II, 193, 194. :) Le Pays d'lsrael, pi. 22, 23, 24."], [287, "275 the subsequent part of the journey through W. Hariry and W. el- Kurn is cheered by the wdd shrub-oak vegetation of their jagged sides. The journey from Dimes to Damascus across the Sahra and the barren chalk-hills of the Eastern ranges of Antilebanon is extremely wearisome. It might be avoided by turning off from Sahel Jedeideh to the left by a path leading over the high ridge N. of AVady el-Kiirn and crossing the Barada-river about a mile above the waterfad in the Southern angle of the Zebedany-plain. The river is recrossed by the bridge above Zfik AVady Barada (with the ruins of Abda Lysaniael and again a little lower down in order to pass by the beautiful fountain of Fijeh on its left bank. Or , if reserving the visit of this fountain till returning from Damascus , the right bank may be kept, past Huseiniyeh and Deir Kanon , and then across the lower part of the Sahra to Jedeideh and Jisr Dummar. At Damascus the independent tent-life had better, for quiet and safety's sake, be interrupted for the time being by taking up a room in the Hotel. Mr. Porter's Five Years in Damascus will prove an excel lent guide-book for whatever is interesting not only within this famous and wonderful city, but also for its environs , and for the journey to a Tadmor in the wdderness\u00bb , if that excursion is to be added to the journey in Palestine. In this matter the traveder will have to consult his own physical strength , remembering that the trip to Tadmor is one of both mental and boddy fatigue, and that by over doing things, he might deprive himself of much further enjoyment. In travelling from Damascus to Ba'albek our chapter of routes and distances gives a large choice. AVhen the fountain of Fijeh has already been visited, it may be highly interesting to go now to Zebe dany by the wdd and romantic Wady Helbon, and Beludan. Here again Mr. Porter's travels are the best guide. By either of the roads as indicated in route 1 1 Ba'albek is reached from Zebedany in one day. To remain a day over encamped under the fig-trees and at the side of a pleasant little stream, close by the wonderful ruins of the famous temple ofthe Sun, is a matter of course. This resting-day will be sides prove a good preparation for the next day's journey of 9 or 10 hours to the banks of the Orontes-river, at a place where it is forded half an hour S. E. of el-Hurmul. Two roads may be followed thither ; but the AVestern one is the shortest and easiest. By turning off a httle to the right of the road from the wed near Sha'ad, a delight ful noonday resting-place wdl be found under the shade of trees and at the side of a fine spring called Ras el-Hadeth. The object of going so far North is to visit the curious monument known as Kamoa el-Hurmul and the beautiful fountain of the Orontes beneath the famous convent of Mar Maron , the founder of the Maro nites. From the high ground ofthe Kamoa el -Hurmiil an excellent view will at the same time be obtained of the wide plain between 18*"], [288, "276 Riblah and Horns and of its lake. By turning now from Hurmiil up the steep and wooded slopes of Lebanon , a beautiful part of that range is wandered over , which is ad the more interesting, as it is almost unknown to European travellers. Three different ranges rise in nearly paradel direction the one above the other , with wide plateaus between. The first and second range are crossed , but the main and highest ridge is kept on the right. The range , which for a long while has shut out the view of the Arale of Coelesyria , opens again when coming nearer to the Cedars, and a beautiful view is enjoyed over the wide-stretched plain with the different ranges of hills and heights which descend to it from Lebanon. Sunnin and Hermon close the horizon of this grand and glorious scene'). Stid sublimer, but of a quite different character, is the view which bursts upon the traveller from the highest part of the pass, when crossing the main Lebanon range in order to descend to the Cedars. No description can convey the impression made upon the mind by the blue -looking gulph thousands of feet deep , through which the Kadisha torrent winds and wrestles down. The Cedars offer as delicious an encampment as can be desired. Also Bsherreh an hour lower down , or any of the smader villages on the opposite side of the Kadisha-chasm. The air in these high regions is exquisite; the refreshing owaters of Lebanon., are seen to flow down in all directions ; and the luxuriant gardens testify to the fruit fulness of the soil. From Bsherreh to 'Akurah is one of the most fatiguing journeys in Lebanon. The road winds over several high spurs of the great mountain-ridge between 6000 and 7500 feet elevation, as the patches of snow around will testify. But the scenery is everywhere grand and beautiful, with a variety such as is only met with in these regions. And so it continues from 'Akurah to the fountain of the Nahr Ibrahim at Afka and the two fountains of the Nahr Salib to Neba el-Asal and Neba el-Leben; and again from the natural roek-bridge and the ruins of Fokra down and across the deep rent chasm of the Nahr Salib to Ajeltun. Over rocky ridges , between numerous vdlages. fertde gardens and verdant orchards , surrounded by convents which lift their lofty wads above pleasant pine-woods, the path winds down to the bridge over the Nahr el-Kelb near its mouth, where the famous tablets are found , the memorials of various conquerors of this classic land. Less than three hours from the bridge wid bring the traveller back to Beirut and to his journey's end.

The tourist who has only the 3 spring-months at his disposal, must , of course , give up the visit of several places here mentioned, and can only enjoy a short stay in Jerusalem.

It is well not to linger in Beirut, when once having completed the journey.

Anton, on the way from Damascus to Scytho- polis ; identified from an inscription, found in its extensive ruins, with Sanamein of Abulfeda , now Sunamein (von Richter writes Salamen) , a large Moslem-village in the district of Jedur (Ritter XV, 812 \u2014 817 from descriptions of Seetzen, Burckhardt, &c). Ai, Royal Canaanitish city, on the E. side of and near Bethel (Gen. XII, 8; XIII, 3; Josh. VII, 2; VIII, 1 , 2 &c. ; X, 1, 28) ; having a deep valley on the N. side (Josh. VIII, 11) ; conquered by Joshua and destroyed ; inhabited by the Benjaminites after the captivity (Neh. VII, 32; XI, 31; Esra II, 28); now Tell el-Hajar, a tell, about 40' E. by S. from Beitin, on the Southern brow of the deep Wady el-Mvityah ; the top of the tell is small and shows no other remains of antiquity than a broken"], [295, "283 cistern. Its position answers in every way to the requirements of the Scriptural narrative of its conquest. (For further detads see Narrat. II, 278-282.) It was first mentioned to us by Mr. Finn of Jerusalem, in whose company we visited the place, coming up to it from Jericho. No other site in the whole Eastern neigh bourhood answers to the Biblical conditions of its position. Ked's supposition, that Ai is identical with Turmus Aya (comm. on Joshua p. 180 sq.), cannot hold, as there is no deep vadey near Turmus Aya; and Michmash, which ace. to 1 Sam. XIII, 5 was near Ai, is at least 3 or 3% hours S. of Turmus Aya. In Isa. X, 28 it is called Aiath. Aijalon, city of Dan (Josh. XIX, 42), given to the Levites (XXI, 24) ; fortified by Rehoboam (2 Chr. XI, 10) ; taken by the Phi- listines (2 Chr. XXATII, 18); 2 R. m. from Nicopods (now 'Amwas) towards Jerusalem (Onom.), where it is now found as the village of Yalo, (Lat. Bibl. Res. p. 145) on the hdl-side S.E. of a ofine mountain basin.. , which Robinson considers to be the valley of Aijalon, where Joshua commanded the sun to stand stdl (Bibl. Res. Ill, 63) (Josh.X, 12). The Phdistines, defeated by Saul and Jonathan, were pursued from Michmash to Aijalon (1 Sam. XIV, 31). (Winer, p. 40). Aijalon, city of Zebulon, where Elon , the Judge, was buried (Judg. XII, 12); perhaps identical with Jaliin, a site of ruins, about 4 hours E. of 'Akka, and 30' S.S.W. of Mejdel-Kerum ; if this supposition is correct, Aijalon was situated on the very frontiers between Zebulon and Asher. (Narr. I, 286, where Jabin has been erroneously supposed to be identical with Adon of Josh. XIX, 33, which does not seem to be intended for a proper name, but for oak (the remarkable oak near Zaannaim) ; (Stanley, p. 516). Ain, North-Eastern boundary mark of the land of Israel (Num XXXIV, 11). Porter (Five years &c. II, 335, 336) observes that the LXX have better translated: Riblah on the East-side of the fountain; and supposes therefore the thus emphatically mentioned fountain to refer to the great source of the Orontes-river near el-Hurmul, which is indeed to the S.W. of Riblah. The same opinion is given in the Lat. Bibl. Res. p. 534. Alamelech, city of Asher (Josh. XIX, 26). Its site is unknown, but seems to have perpetuated its name in that of Wady el-Malek. the chief Northern branch of the Kishon, near Carmel. The re- searches of future traveders may perhaps lead them to recognize in one of the ruins situated about or in this valley the remains of the fenced city."], [296, "284 Alexandrium, a castle on a hdl near Coreae, now Kurivit (Jos. A. XIV, 3, 4 ; 5,2; B. J. I, 6, 5 ; also A. XVI, I, 1, 7 ; B. J. I, 27, 6), built by Alexander Jannaeus ; now Kefr Istuna, a vd- lage about 1% hour S.E. from Shdoh. Here are the ruins of an ancient castle, built with stones of very large dimensions. It is about l'/\u201e hour from Kurivit. ATisited and identified by E. G. Schultz (Ritter XV, 452\u2014454). Alexandroschene, a city at the Southern foot of the Scala Tyriorum (the Ras el-Abiad) ; 12 R. m. from Tyre and also from Ecdippa (Itin. Hieros.) ; now a ruin called Iskanderuna. Almon, Levitical city (Josh. XXI, 18; I Chr. VI, 60 Alemeth), mentioned in connection with Anatoth ; identified by Tobler (Denkblatter etc. p. 631) with a ruin 'Almit (he writes less cor- rectly el-Mid) about 1 hour N.E. of Anata. Ani-ad, frontier-city of Asher (Josh. XIX, 26); possibly identical with a village caded Um el-'Amad \u00abthe mother of columns... Yet Robinson heard the people of the neighbouring Bethlehem say, that there were no columns (Later B. R. p. 113). This name must therefore have another origin and would seem to be derived from the Hebrew Am-ad. Simdar instances of cor- ruptions of Hebrew names into Arabic ones of very different meaning occur frequently. So f. i. Beth-lehem and Beit-lahm. Amatba (Onom. s. v. Aemath) near Gadara ; now Amateh, a ruin on the Nahr Yarmuk, not far from UmKeis. Discovered by Seetzen. (See also Burckhardt , Travels, p. 273, 276 \u2014 278; Ritter XV, 372.) Amathus, discovered by Burckhardt (Travels, p. 346) in the ruins of Amateh. The distance S. of Peda, as given in the Onom. 21 R. m., is rather too much. Josephus calls it the principal fortress on the Jordan. (See v. Raumer, p. 213). Anab, city of Judah in the mountains (Josh. XI, 21; XV, 50); now 'Anab, a vidage with ancient ruins S. of Hebron. (Bibl. Res. II, 195.) Ananiah, city of Benjamm (Neh. XI, 32); mentioned along with Anathoth, Ramah, &c. ; perhaps the present Beit-Hanina, E. of Naby Samwil (Rabbi Schwartz, p. 133; Tobler, Top. von Jerus. II, 411). Anatoth, Levit. city of Benjamin (Josh. XXI, 18); birth-place of Abiezer (2 Sam. XXIII, 27) and Jeremiah (Jer. 1,1; XXIX, 2 7 , comp. XI, 21 \u2014 23) ; inhabited after the Captivity (Ezra II, 23 ; Neh. VII, 27) ; now 'Anata, 1 % hour N.N.E. from Jeru- salem (Bibl. Res. II, 109; Tobler, Topogr. II, 394). Ace. to Josephus (A. X, 7, 3) 20 stadia from Jerusalem."], [297, "285 Anim, mountain - city of Judah (Josh. XV, 50); possibly the same called Ain in Josh. XXI, 16, a city given to the Levites. Iden- tified by Wilson (vol. I, 354; II, 636) with Ghuwein, a vidage one hour S. of Semoa, on the road from Hebron to Moladah. It is different from Ain mentioned along with Rimmon in the plain (Josh. XAr, 32 ; XIX, 7 ; see art. Rimmon). Antipatris. As far as this place the Apostle Paul was conducted from Jerusalem , during the night , on his way to Caesarea (Acts XXIII, 31); formerly Capharsaba (Joseph. A. XIII , 15. I; XVI, 5. 2) ; rebuilt, as Antipatris by Herod. Alexander Jannaeus drew a trench with a wall and wooden towers from Antipatris to the coasts of Joppa , 150 stadia in length , in order to prevent the passage of Antiochus (Bell. Jud. I, 4, 7; Ant. XIII, 15, 1). It was situated at the foot of the mountains (ib.), in a fertile spot, and encompassed by a river (Ant. XVI, 5, 2); 10 R. m. from Lydda. and 26 from Caesarea (Itin. Hierosol.) ; 6 R. m. N. from Gdgal (now Jiljiliyeh) (Onom.). Robinson (Later Bibl. Res. p. 138, 139 and Bibl. Sac 1853, p. 528 sq.), with von Raumer, holds it to be identical with the present village Kefr Saba , adding that there is no valid reason for questioning the identity. Eli Smith, however, in Bibl. Sacra 1843, p. 478 sq., giving an account of his visit to Kefr Saba and Mejdel (or Mejdel Yaba), although inclining towards the identity, leaves* some doubts about it, and shows that the position of Mejdel Yaba answers better to that of Antipatris, than Kefr Saba. Mejdel is 10 R. m. from Lydda; Kefr Saba not 20 as v. Raumer and Robinson propose, but 17. Mejdel is also 6 R. m. South from Jiljiliyeh: Kefr Saba 3 N.N.AV. It is well known, that the distance from Caesarea to Jerusalem by Antipatris as given by the Itin. Hierosol. is too short. As the supposition is ventured, that this Itin. makes an error of 10 R. m. in the distance be- tween Antipatris and Lydda, so it may be supposed, that an error of 10 R. m. is made between Caesarea and Antipatris ; the for mer supposition does not agree with the actual distance between Ludd and Kefr Saba ; the latter supposition, making Caesarea 36 instead of 26 R. m. from Antipatris, does agree with the Map. when taking the route by Kakun and Bethar , the ancient high road. The position of Mejdel at the foot of the hids and at the N. side ofthe torrent, which comes down AV. Belat to the N. el-'Aujeh, answers perfectly to Josephus' description. The trench made by Alexander Jannaeus was easily made by deepening the bed of this torrent, from Mejdel to its junction with the 'Aujeh : and that it forms an impassable barrier when swollen by the winter-rains, we have found by experience (Narrat. I, 417, 418). From Kefr Saba such a channel to the coast cannot be traced :"], [298, "286 nor would it have prevented Antiochus' march, which might have been effected E. of Kefr Saba. Josephus' statement for the length of the trench, 1 50 stadia will be found nearly true , when from Mejdel the windings of the 'Aujeh are brought into account. The exact length would perhaps be 120 stadia. Antipatris was an episcopal city , and continued inhabited by Christians in the middle of the eighth century. No ancient remains are visible at Kefr Saba; but there are at Mejdel, and of a character which shows them to have belonged to a Christian population (Narrat. I, 427 and plate at the end of vol. II). There remains, therefore, only the correspondence of names in favour of the identification ofthe ancient Caphar Saba with Kefr Saba ; whdst ad other arguments plead in favour of Mejdel, to which it must be added, that the night-march which the soldiers made with Paul from Jerusalem to Antipatris, would not likely be so enormous a distance over a difficult mountain-road as that between the two places. A ca valier who in one night reaches Mejdel from Jerusalem, has rid den to the utmost of his exertions. We cannot, therefore, but entertain great doubts, whether a transposition of names , not at all without example in Palestine, has not fixed the name of Kefr Saba on a village , which may have no other claim to it , than some Crusaders' geographical mistake. Apheca, the celebrated place of the Temple of Venus , at the fountains of the Adonis-rivei- ; destroyed by order of the Emperor Con- stantine (Eusebius) . Now Afka , with a few remains of a con- struction which the natives cad el -Kid' ah (the castle). (See Route 4.) For historical notices see Lat. Bibl. Res. p. 606. Aphek, where the Phdistines gathered together their armies against Saul (1 Sam. XXIX, 1) ; seems to have been on the site of the present el-'Afideh in the plain of Esdraelon ; the Crusaders and pdgrims of the middle ages considered it so (Reisebuch des H. Landes) ; or on the place of the neighbouring el-Fuleh, the Ca- stellum Faba of the Crusaders (Bibl. Res. Ill, 177- Wilson II, 89). Aphek, near this city the scene of the battle between the Syrians and Israelites (1 Kings XX, 26); on the E. side of Jordan, as the context refers to \u00abMishor.i, the uplands beyond Jordan (Stanley, p. 340, 480); the same with Fik , a large vdlage on the high table-land E. of Lake Tiberias; Apheca (Onom.). Aphek, city of Judah, see Azeka. Apollonia (Joseph. Ant. XIII, 5, 4. B. Jud. I, 8, 4), now Arsuf, a site of ruins on the N. side and near the vidage el-Haram Ibn 'Aly Aleim (see Route 38). The Crusaders mistook it for Antipatris. In their days it was strongly fortified. Ritter XVI, 590."], [299, "287 Araba, a city near Diocaesarea (Sephurieh) (Onom.); 20 stadia from the town of Sogane (Jos. Vit. 51); now the village Arrabeh, about 4 hours N. of Nazareth. There are Jewish graves (Car- moly Itin. p. 383) to which pdgrimages are performed, besides other remains of antiquity. (First visited and identified by E. G. Schultz; Ritter XVI, 768. Comp. Lat. Bibl. Res., p. 83, 84.) Araba, a town mentioned by Euseb. and Jerome as situated 3 R. m. AVest of Scythopolis. This would prove , that the present Ted esh-Shuk, which is exactly in that position, would be the same. Nothing further of this Araba is known (Halma, p. 23). Ar, or Ar of Moab, Rabbath \u2022 Moab, the capital of Moab (Num. XXI, 15; XXII, 36; Deut. II, 9; Isa. XV, 1); afterwards Areopolis ; an episc. see of the Third Palestine ; now Rabba, a site with extensive and handsome ruins , ahout 3 hours N. of Kerak (Burckhardt, Travels, p. 37 7: also described by Seetzen, Irby and Mangles; see Bibl. Res. II, 569). Arad, one of the 31 royal Canaanitish cities conquered by Joshua (Josh. XII, 14) ; in the S. part of Palestine (Num. XXI, 1 ; XXXIII, 40; Judg. I, 16) ; now Ted-' Arad, a small tell, about 6 hours S. of Hebron. There are still fragments of pottery found on its top, and a ruined reservoir on the S. side of the ted (Narr. II. 83 \u2014 85). Its position agrees pretty well with that given by Eusebius as 20 R. m. S. of Hebron and 4 R. m. from Malatha. now Ted Mdh. Episc. city in Jerome's days. (Ritter, XLV, 121; Carmoly p. 245). Arbela, a town beyond Jordan, near the territory of Pella (Onom.); probably now Irbid, a large vdlage with extensive ruins near W. Shelaleh (visited by Seetzen, Burckhardt. Buckingham, &c. Ritter XV, 1054 sq.). Arbela, see Beth-Arbel. Archelais, built by Archelaus, the son of Herod; 24 R. m. North of Jericho (Peuting. Tab.) ; vdlage in the Ghor, and surrounded by palm-trees (Joseph. Ant. XVII, 13, 1; XVIII, 2, 2) see Reland, Pal. p. 576. E. G. Schultz has suggested its identity with a site of ruins at the Southern base of a tell in the lower section of AV. el-Fariah, called el- Basaliyeh. This site corre- sponds with the position given by the Peut. Tab. (see Itinerary 12 May). Argob, see Trachonitis. Euseb. and Jerome mention a city Arga or Argob , 15 R. m. West of Gerasa , whfch Joseph, cads Ragaba (Ant. XIII, 15, 5), the present Rajib in AV. 'Ajhin (Ritter XV, 1041), but it seems very doubtful, that it has any connection with the district of Argob."], [300, "288 'Ariath, a city mentioned in the Notitia Eeclesiastica. Porter (Five years &c. II, 136) thinks it possibly may be the present large village 'Ary, nearly 3 hours N. of Busrah , at the Western base of the Ha'uran-mountains. Arnon, the river that separated Moab from the land of the Amorites (Num. XXI, 13, 26; Deut. II, 24; III, 8; Josh. XII, 1; Judg. XI, 22), and later from the tribe of Ruben (Num. XXI, 21 &c. ; Deut. II, 21; Josh. XII; XIII; Isa XVI , 2; Jer. XLVIII, 20). Identified by Burckhardt (Travels, 371, 372) with AATady Mojib. See also AViner p. 88. Aroer, now 'Ar'arah , a site about 3 hours S.E. of Bir es-Seba with several wells containing very good water , and foundations of houses near it. To this city David sent presents after the recovery of the spoil of Ziklag (4 Sam. XXX, 26, 28). (Bibl. Res. II, 618.) Aroer, now a site of ruins in Moab, called 'Arair, about 1 hour N. of W. Mojib, discovered by Burckhardt (Travels, p. 372). Frontier - town of the Amorites , and later of the tribe of Ruben on the banks of the Arnon (Deut. II, 36; III, 12; IV, 48; Josh. XII, 2; XIII, 9, 16; Judg. XI, 26). In Jeremiah's days it belonged to Moab (Jer. XLATII, 19). There is another Aroer mentioned in 2 Sam. XXIV, 5 as \u00abin the midst of the valley of Gad,\u00bb and in Josh. XIII, 25 as situated ((before,\" i. e. to the E. of Rabbah (the present 'Amman) . Ked supposes this latter Aroer to be identical with Kul'at Zerka Gadda , the position of which seems to answer the conditions of Scripture (Comment, on Joshua p. 339). It is also mentioned in Judg. XI, 33. Arumah, the temporary residence of Abimelech near Shechem (Judg. IX, 41); probably the same with a ruin now called el-'Armah (or el-'Ormah) on the brow of the mountain behind Beit-Furik, opposite the valley of Shechem iNarrat. II, 303). Asamon (Mountains) (Jos. Bell. Jud. II, 18, 11), mentioned as over against Sepphoris ; and therefore probably the broken ridge which commences with the high summit of Jebel Kaukab on the AA'est , and runs Eastward along the N. side of the plain of el-Buttauf (the plain of Asochis), 'see also Lat. Bibl. Res. p. 77 and 11 1). Ashdod, Azotus (Acts VIII, 40), now Esdiid, a vidage on an eminence surrounded with beautiful gardens, about 3 hours N. N. E. of the ruins of Askelon on the high road from Egypt to Syria (Narr. II, 173, 174). One of the five Royal Philistian cities (Josh. XIII, 3): belonged to Judah (Josh. XAT, 46, 47). Anakims dwelt there (Josh. XI, 22). The ark of the covenant there in the house of Dagon (1 Sam. X, 1 \u2014 7; AT, 17). Conquered by"], [301, "289 Uzziah (2 Chr. XXVI, 6) ; by the Assyrians (Is. XX, 1). Pro phecies against Ashdod (Jer. XXV, 20; Amos 1 , 8; III, 9; Zeph. II, 4; Zech. IX, 6). Taken by Judas Mace, and destroyed by Jonathan Mace. (1 Mace. N, 68 ; X, S-l). Rebudt by Gabi nius ; belonged to Herod's kingdom. Later figured as episc. city. (Reland, 606; Winer, 96; v. Raumer, 157.) Asher, frontier-city of Manasseh (Josh. XVII, 7, 11); 15 R. m. from Neapolis on the way to Scythopolis (Onom.); in that situation is now found the village of Yasir, with ancient remains (Narrat. II, 336). Askelon, now 'Askulan, large ruins 4 to 4% hours N. of Ghuzzeh, (Narrat. II, 177\u2014180). One of the five Royal cities of the Phdistines (Josh. XIII, 3; Judg. XIV, 19: 1 Sam. AT, 17; 2 Sam. I, 20;' Amos I, 8; Zeph. II , 4 ; Zech. IX , 9 ; Jer. XXAr, 20; XLVII, 5, 7). Conquered by Judah (Judg. I, 18), but never permanently possessed, not even under Solomon (1 Kings IV, 24). Twice conquered by Jonathan Maccab. (1. Mace. X, S6 ; XI, 60). The birth-place of Herod the Great and of his son Antipater (Dapper). Celebrated for its temple of Derceto, the Syrian Venus. Captured in 1 153 by Baldwin III from the power of Saladin. Falls in 1187 into the hands of the Saracens; in 1191 is taken by Richard Coeur de lion ; in 1270 destroyed by Sultan Bibars. Askelon figures among the episcopal cities of Palestine. (Reland, Pal. 5S6 ; Winer, 98 ; v. Raumer, 155, 156.) Astaroth (in Edrei) (Deut I, 4), Ashterofh Karnaim (Gen. XIV, 5) ; residence of Og king of Bashan (Josh. IX, 10; XII, 4; XIII, 12) ; Levitical city of Manasseh (Josh. XIII, 31 ; 1 Chr. VI, 71). Karnaim (1 Mace. V, 43, 44); destroyed by Judas Maccabaeus; was 6 R. m. from Edrei (now Der'a) (Onom.). Capt. Newbold found considerable ruins on a hill called Tell 'Ashtereh ; but the position in which he places the tell neither agrees with that of the Onom., nor with the known places Nawa, Mezarib and Der'a. The name leaves no doubt about the identity with Ashteroth, but the position requires yet to be fixed by the survey- or researches of future travellers. (See Analysis, Section 4). Ritter, XV, p. 822 justly remarks, that Karnaim in the midst of a large plain is not Karnion of 2 Mace. XII, 21, 26 in a narrow valley. Col. Leake's identification of Mezarib with Ashtaroth has the position in its favour ; but at Mezarib there are no antiquities (Burckhardt, Travels, preface p. XII). Ataroth, a city mentioned by Eusebius and Jerome as situated 4 R. m. North of Samaria. A village of the name of 'Atara is still existing in nearly the place thus pointed out. This, however, cannot be the South-Western border-city of Ephraim (Josh. XAT, van de Velde, Holy Land. 1 9"], [302, "290 2). Rabbi Schwartz identifies the latter with Latrfin, which he says is a corruption of el-Etron I or Atarim) , and identical with Athroth of 1 Chr. II, 54, which is mentioned along with Beth Joab (Descr. Geogr. of Pal. p. 143). About 1% mdes E. of Latrun there is indeed stid a village called Bir Ayub. Latrun, a fortress during the Crusaders' times, known as Castedum Emmaus, is said to have received its name from the legendary birth-place of the penitent thief ((Castedum boni Ladronis\u00bb. But this tradition dates only from the 16,h century; and both its name and position would therefore seem to plead in favour of R. Schwartz's iden tification. Ataroth, a city constructed by the tribe of Gad (Num. XXXII, 34), now a ruin called Attarus, on the W. slopes of Jebel Attarus, (E. side of Dead Sea) discovered by Seetzen (Reise II, 342). Ataroth, a city of Benjamin (Onom.), now a ruin 'Atara, near er- Ram. In the Scriptures this Ataroth is not mentioned. Another ' Atara, a large village, is situated between Jifna and Jdjdia , W. of the road from Beth-el to Shdoh ; this may be the Ataroth-addar of Josh. XAT , 5; if so, it would be different from Ataroth addar of Josh. XVIII, 13 , which seems to have been S.AV. of the lower Beth-horon , and the same with Latrun , Ataroth of Josh. XVI, 2. The position of the latter 'Atara we thought to be too imperfectly known to be introduced into our Map. Auranitis, Ha'uran, border-district of the .(Promised land., on the E. side (Ezek. XLVII, 16, 18) ; referred to by Joseph. (Ant. XV, 10, 1 and 2) ; now the rich and extensive plain caded Ha'uran, to the W. of the mountains of that name and S. of the Lejah. The name Ha'uran is, however, now also applied to the whole country E . of Jordan from the plain of Damascus down to the latitude of the Northern extremity of the Dead Sea (Porter II, 263, 264). Azeka, city of Judah in the plain (Josh. XV, 35) ; half way between Jerusalem and Eleutheropohs. Joshua defeated the five united kings from Gibeon to Azeka. Goliath's camp between Sochoh and Azeka (1 Sam. XVII) ; fortified by Rehoboam (2 Chr. XI, 9) ; besieged by Nebuchadnezzar (Jer. XXXIV, 7). Inhabited after the captivity (Neh. XI, 30). On our route from Beit-Jibrin to Jerusalem (Itinerary 9 April 1852) we came past a ruined city on the high Northern brow of AV. Musur, about one hour E. by S. of Beit-Netif , caded Khirbet Damun. This name connected with the vadey of Elah (AV. Musur) and the neighbouring Sochoh (Shuweikeh) leaves ho doubt as to this being the ancient Dam- mim of 1 Sam. XVII, 1 , which fixes the place of the camp of Goliath just at its foot, where the vadey contracts and may in-"], [303, "291 deed be called the pass of Dammim. This fixes at the same time the position of Azeka , which must have been quite near and to the N. E. side of Dammim. It, therefore, cannot be iden tical with the remarkable high Ted-Zakaria, AArest of Shuweikeh, as Rabbi Schwartz suggests , but seems to be identical with a village on a high hill-top , called Ahbek, the position of which answers exactly with that where the Onom. places Azeka, and corresponds perfectly with the Scriptural requirements. It is situated about 1 % mdes N. of Damun and between 4 and 5 miles E.N.E. of Shuweikeh. Yet this Ahbek may perhaps be identical with another city of Judah, Aphek of 1 Sam. IA'', 1 (and perhaps also of Josh. XII, 18) as its name seems to suggest. Aziri, a city of Manasseh mentioned in the Talmud, identical with Azirah, a vdlage, 1 hour N. of Nabulus (Rabbi Schwartz, p. 160;. Azmaveth or Beth \u2022 azmaveth, mentioned along with Anathoth (Neh. ATI, 28). Ritter (XVI, 519) supposes it to be identical with the present village of Hizmeh to the N. of 'Anata. Baalath, city of Dan (Josh. XIX, 44); probably now the ruin Deir Baliit, I1/, hour S. of Mejdel, on the high Southern brow of Wady Kerawa. That this is not Baalath of i Kings IX, 1 8 and 2 Chr. VIII, 6, which Solomon fortified, is evident, since Deir Baliit is not situated near a high-way, where a fortified place is required. Baalath of Simeon, see Ramath of the South Baal-gad or Baal-Hermon, see Caesarea Philippi. Bareca or Barakai , a town mentioned in the Onom . near Azotus ; now the village Burka, an hour N.E. of Esdiid. (See also Re- land, p. 615.) Bashan, a kingdom on the E. side of Jordan (Num. XXI, 33; XXXII. 33; Deut. I, 4; Josh. IX, 10; XII, 4); assigned to Manasseh (Deut. Ill, 13; Josh. XIII, 30; XXI, 6; XXII, 7; 1 Chr. Y , 23); in a general way included in Gilead (1 Kings IV, 19; comp. Josh. XIII, 31); but yet mentioned as distinct from it (Josh. XVII, 1, 5 ; XX, 8 ; 2 Kings X, 33 ; Mic. VII, 14; comp. Deut. Ill, 8\u201410; Ps. LXVIII, 15); the district of Golan included in Bashan (Deut. IV, 43; Josh. XX, 8; XXI, 27). Its N.E. and E. boundaries mentioned (Josh. XII, 5; Deut. Ill, 10). References to its mountains , oak-forests, mea- dows and'cattle (Deut. XXXII, 14; Ps. XXII, 13; Isa II, 13; Ezek. XXVII, 6; XXXIX, 18; Jer. L, 19; Amos IV, 1; Mic. VII, 14 ; Zech.

It extends from the plain below Tell Khalediyeh on the N. to Sulkhad on the S. ; and from Ku- nawat to the great plain Eastward (Porter, Five years &c. II, 264 \u2014 266). The capital Batanaea is identified by Porter (II, 57) with the modern village Bathaniyeh, in the Northern part of the district of that name. Here are extensive ruins In the Notit. Eccles. of the Geogr. Sac. of S. Paulo , it is mentioned as Ba- tanis, an Episcopal city. Beeroth, city of the Gibeonites (Josh. IX, 17) ; given to Benjamin (Josh. XVIII, 25 ; 2 Sam. IV, 2) ; inhabited after the captivity (Ezra II, 25; Neh. VII, 29); erroneously placed by Jerome at only 7 R. m. North of Jerusalem on the way to Neapolis ; identified by Robinson with the present village el-Bireh, 3 hours N. of Je- rusalem, fodowing Maundred's suggestion (Bibl. Res. II, 132). Beer-Sheba, ..the well of swearing.. (Gen. XXI, 31 ; XXVI, 33), or ..the wed of seven.. (Gen. XXI, 29, 30) ; 20 R. m. South of Hebron (Onom. \u2014 incorrect \u2014 ) ; now Bir es-Seba, first identified, but not visited by Seetzen (Reise III, 3,2). Robinson visited the site with E. Smith in 1838 (Bibl. Res. I, 300). There are five an- cient wells, two of which onfy contain water ; the foundations of the town and a few scattered building-stones are found on the N. side of the wells and wady of Bir es-Seba.

A bishop's see in the days of Jerome. Its history is described in the Bibl. Res. Ill, 442 \u2014 447. Robinson adds that the name suggests the identity with Berothai or Berothah of 2 Sam. VIII, 8 ; Ezek. XLVII, 16, but that the context seems to refer to an inland city of Northern Syria. The Biblical Berothah is identified by Keith (Land of Israel p. 129 sq.) with Beer or Birat, a place near the Euphrates (comp. Wilson II, 206, and Rabbi Schwartz, p. 4S3, 484).

These distances are respectively applicable to the vdlages 'Annabeh and Beit-Niiba to the S. E. of Ludd. Ro- binson incdnes to the identity ofthe former with Beth-annoba (Lat. B. R. p. 144). The Crusaders also mention Annaba 8 R. m. from Diospolis (van Senden, Het hedige Land). Beth-anoth, mountain-city of Judah (Josh.

Here are very extensive ruins with large bevelled stones, showing a very high antiquity. (Wdson I, 384, 385). Bethany, chouse of dates..

I, 16, 2\u20144); fortified by Josephus (vita \u00a7 37. B. J. II, 20, 6). Beth-aven, city of Benjamin, near Ai (Josh. VII, 2; XATII , 12; 1 Sam. XIII, -5 ; XIV, 23). Is sometimes identified with Beth-el because of Hos. IV, 15; X, 5. (Jerome, Talmud, &c. , also Stanley p. 216 - 221) ; but, as Winer (art. Bethaven) observes, it is distinctly said in Josh. VII, 2 &c. that Beth-aven was on the E. of Beth-el. Its site must, therefore, have been on the rocky eminence 20 minutes S. E. oi Beth-el and 20 minutes West of Ai (Tell el-Hajar). Beth-baal-meon, city of Reuben (Josh. XIII, 17); Baal-meon in Num. XXXII, 38; Beth-meon, Jer. XLVIII, 23; later under Moab (Ezek. XXV, 9) ; 9 R. m. S.E. from' Heshbon (Onom.). Its ruins were found by Burckhardt about 45 S. of Hesban; they are now called Main. Probably the same with Beon of Num. XXXII, 3 (Winer, art. Baal-Meon). Beth-Dagon, city of Judah (Josh. XV, 41); is not the village Beit- Dejan, on the road between Yafa and Ludd, as this is far beyond the plain of Judah ; in the days of Eusebius and Jerome the lat- ter vdlage existed under the name of Beth-Dagon or Caphar- Dagon, for what reason is unknown (Bibl. Res. Ill, 30 ; Tobler, Top. II, 405; R. Schwartz p. 105). Beth-el, formerly Luz (Gen. XXVIII, 19; Judg. I, 22, 23, 26; Josh. XVIII, 13) ; in mount Ephraim, on the high-way from Je- rusalem to Shechem (Gen. XII, 8 ; XIII, 3 : Judg. IV, 5 ; XXI, 19 ; 1 Sam. XIII, 2); ancient Canaanitish Royal city (Josh. XII. 16) ; frontier-city of Benjamin (Josh. XVIII, 22 ; Judg. XVI, 1): here the tabernacle (Judg. XX, IS, 26, &c; 1 Sam. X, 3) ; here Samuel judged Israel (1 Sam.

(Stanley p. 477) city of Asher (Josh. XIX, 27) ; now the village of'Amkah 2*/s hours N. E. of 'Akka at the foot of the hills. Robinson (Lat. Bibl. Res. p. 103, 108) also speaks of the identity, but seems to doubt it. as he supposes the reading of Josh. XIX, 27 to imply that Beth- emek lies S. of the valley Jiphthah-el (Wady Abilin). The A'ul- gate, however, seems to read that the border of Asher went from Zebulon (Abilin) through the valley of Jiphthah - el to the N. as far as Beth-Emek , Neiel and Cabul. (Sanson in Halma p. 46 : Masius in Keil comm. on Joshua p. 431, 432). In Narrat. I. 268 it is written Umma , according to the way I heard it pro- nounced ; the k being often dropped by the natives. Hence I mistook it for Umma of Josh. XIX, 30. Bether (Cant. II, 17); a strongly fortified city, in the neighbourhood of Jerusalem, mentioned in the Onom. ; famous for its. last siege and massacre of the Jews by the Romans. Perhaps the same with Boether of tbe LXX (Josh. XV, 59) ; and with the present village of Bittir, 2 hours AV. S. AV. of Jerusalem. ;G. AArilliams, The Holy City II, 210; Stewart, p. 347). Robinson, however, differs from this opinion, and proposes Bether or Beth-Tar to be identical with Beth-el, now Beitin, about 4 hours N. of Jerusalem (Later Bibl. Res. p. 266\u2014271). Bether, Bither or Bethar, of the Talmud, at 4 R. m. from the sea (Reland, p. 639); Betarum (Itin. Anton, et Hieros.); on the way from Caesarea to Antipatris; now probably the vidage of Barin, about 1 '/\u00bb hour S. of Kakun (Rabbi Schwartz p. 1 1 1). Beth-Gamui, a city of Moab (Jer. XLATII, 23). E. Smith suggests it to be identical with Um el-Jemal, ruins on the road from Busrah to Der'a (Edrei) (Bibl. Res. Ill App. 153). We believe the suggestion open to much doubt, as it is difficult to prove that Moab had ever reached so far North. See also Bozrah. Beth-haccerem ..the house of the vineyard.) ; a beacon-station in Judea (Jer. VI, 1) ; probably the same with the present Frank-moun- tain or Jebel-Fureidis, S.E. of Bethlehem (Pococke; doubted by Robinson, Bibl. Res. II, 173; but affirmed by Wilson, I, 396; Bonar in Nair. of Mis. to Jews p. 247 ; Stanley p. 163, 164 ; Narrat. II, 39). The ruins on this mountain are also iden- tical with the castle Herodium, built by Herod, 60 stadia from Jerusalem, near Tekoa (see v. Raumer p. 203 art. Thekoa ; and AVoleott in Bibl. Sacra 1813 p. 69, 70)."], [308, "296 Beth-haran Num. XXXII, 36), Beth-aram (Josh. XIII, 27), city of Gad , in the 'Jordan - valley ; called Livias and also Julias by Herod. (Ant. XIV, 1, 4; XVII, 8, 1 ; XX, 8, 4; B. J. II, 13, 2; IV, 7, 5); later an episcopal city ; its ruins are yet found South of Wady Seir, about one hour East of the Jordan, and caded Beit-Haran. Beth-Hoglah, city of Benjamin, on the borders of Judah (Josh. XV, 6; XVIII, 19, 21); was probably situated either at 'Ain Hajla or at the ruined castle Hajla, S.E. of Jericho i^Bibl. Res. II, 268 ; Wdson, II, 15). Beth-horon (the nether and the upper), border-cities between Ephraim and Benjamin, assigned to the Levites (Josh. XAT, 3 ; XVIII, 13 ; XXI, 22) ; mentioned also in Josh. X, 1 1 ; 1 Kings IX, 17 ; 1 Chr. VII, 24; 2 Chr. ATII, 5, 26; XXV, 13; now Beit-Ur et-tahta and el-foka , on the way from Jerusalem to Ludd, at very nearly the distance where the Onom. places these vdlages, viz. 12 R. m. from the former city. Beth-Jeshimoth, nhouse of the wastes.. (Stanley p. 296, 484). Here were tbe Israelites encamped in the plain of Shittim (Num. XXXIII, 48, 49). City of Moab, assigned to Reuben (Josh. XIII, 20; Ezek. XXAr, 9); 10 R. m. South (should be S.E.) of Jericho (Onom.); captured by Placidus , general of Arespasian (Joseph. B. J. IV, 7, 5). Kiepert has introduced the ruins of Beth-Jeshimoth in his Map of Palestine 1842. As the Dead Sea- shore is at no great distance, their position leaves little room for question. Bethlehem, city of Judah, formerly Ephrath (Gen. XXXV, 19; XLVHI, 7; Ruth I, 2 ; 1 Sam. XVII, 12; Mic. V, 1; Judg. XVII, 7, 9 ; XIX, 1 ; Matth. II. 1,5); 6 R. m. South from Jeru- salem (Onom.) ; the birth-place of David (1 Sam. XAT, 1 ; XVII, 1 2) ; and of the Saviour (Matth. II, 5 ; Luke II, 4, 7) ; fortified by Rehoboam (2 Chr. XI, 6) ; now Beitlahm, a thriving little town, chiefly inhabited by Christians. Bethlehem, city of Zebulon (Josh. XIX, 15) ; now the vidage Beitlahm about midway between Nazareth and mount Carmel, in tbe hills. Beth-leptepha , the capital of Beth -lepthephene , a district opposite Pella, on the W. side of the Jordan (Reland p. .648; Halma p. 323) ; perhaps identical with a site of ruins at the Northern base of Mount Gilboa called Beit- Ufa (Narr. II, 366). Beth-nimrah, city of Gad (Num. XXXII, 36; Josh. XIII, 27); 5 R. ni. N. oi Beth-haran (Onom. Bethamnaram) : now ruins called Nimrin in the lower part of AVady Sha'ib, near the Jordan."], [309, "297 Bethphage (.house of figs.. (Stanley p. 1S5), vdlage near Bethany (Matth. XXI, 1 ; Luke XIX, 29). The tradition of pilgrims since the Crusaders' days mentions it as situated on the S. Eastern slope of Mount Olivet near Bethany. Dr. Olin mentions to have found foundations of houses and a cistern hewn in the rock at that place (Narr. II, 257). Dr. Barclay, however, identifies Bethphage with traces of foundations and cisterns marking an ancient site on the rocky S. AArestern spur of Olivet, a few hundred yards to the S. ofthe Jericho - Jerusalem road between Bethany and the valley of the Kedron (Stewart, The tent and the khan p. 332). Beth-Rehob, see Caesarea-Philippi. Beth Saida ..of Galilee.. (John XII, 21); Peter, Andrew and Philip from Bethsaida (John I, 44) ; prophecies against it (Matth. XI, 21-24; Luke X, 13-15) ; Seetzen came to Khan Bat Saida, at the Northern end of a plain, at the Southern end of which is Mejdel. This would fix Bethsaida at Khan Miniyeh, which Ro- binson identifies with Capernaum (see Capernaum). Thrupp found that the name Bethsaida was known among the people at the Lake of Tiberias ; they even corrected him in the pronuncia- tion of the word. But they shewed less knowledge of its site, fixing it between Tiberias and Magdala, at 'Ain el-Barideh, where there are a few ruins of buddings (Thrupp. M. S. notes). Beth Saida in Gaulonitis , caded afterwards Julias by Phdip the Te- trarch. Referred to in Marc. VHI, 22; Luke IX, 10. (Narrat. II, 395 ; v. Raumer p. 109, who treats the art. Bethsaida in full ; Keith, Evidences etc. p. 161) ; now a ruin caded et-Ted, on the N.E. side of Lake Tiberias. Beth-Shean, city of Manasseh (Josh. XVII, 11, 12; Judg. I, 27; 1 Sam. XXXI, 10, etc.; 1 Kings IV, 12); Scythopolis (Judith III, 10; Jos. Ant. V, 1, 22; XII, 8, 5; XIII, 6, I ; B. J. Ill, 3, 1, etc.); episcopal city in the fourth century; now Beisan, a miserable ruined vidage, inhabited by Bedawin. The ruins of the former city are very considerable ; they are chiefly at the Southern base of the high tell, which itself bears still parts of the wall of the ancient acropolis (Narrat. II, 359-363 ; Lat. B.R.p. 329 sq.). Beth-Shemesh , ..house of the Sun\u00bb , city of Issachar between Mount Tabor and the Jordan (Josh. XIX, 22) ; not the same with Beth- Shemesh of Naphtali (Josh. XIX, 38) as Ked supposes (Comm. Joshua p. 440); probably the same with the village Kaukab (\u00abStar\u00bb) -el-Hawa (as Rabbi Schwartz proposes) ; also identical with Belvoir of the Crusaders (E. G. Schultz in Ritter XV, 104 . Beth-Shemesh, \u00abhouse of the Sun\u00bb, frontier-city of Judah (Josh. XV, 10); assigned to the Levites (Josh. XXI, 9, 16 ; 1 Chr.

Its ruins were visited by Robinson and Smith, on the W. side of the village 'Ain Shems, S. of Wady Siirar (Bibl. Res. Ill, 17-20). Beth-tappuah, mountain-city of Judah (Josh. XV, 53); identified by Robinson with the modern village Teffuh, about 2 hours W. of Hebron (Bibl. Res. II, 428). Bethuliah, a strongly fortified town on a hdl near Dothan (Jud. VIII, \u00ab 3 ; X, 10). There was a fountain at the foot of the hid (Jud. VII, 3, 13; XII, 7). 'v. Raumer (p. 135) suggested its identity with the present Sanur, between Jenin and Sebustiyeh. The discovery of Dothan has since confirmed this identification (Narr. I, 367, 368; Stewart, p. 421 ; v. Schubert, III, 161). Beth - Zacharia, identified by Robinson and Smith with Beit-Zakaria, a village, about I1' 15' W. of the Jerusalem-Hebron road, 1 % hour S.AV. of Solomon's pools. According to Joseph. (Ant. XII, 9, 4; Bell. Jud. I, 1, 5) 70 furlongs from Bethsura. Here Judas Mace. was defeated by Antiochus Eupator (1 Maec. VI, 32, 33). (Lat. Bibl. Res. p. 283, 284). The ruins are here extensive. There is an old wely called Abu Zakary. Beth-Zur, mountain-city of Judah (Josh. XV, 58), 20 R. m. from Jerusalem on the way to Hebron ; now the ruined tower Beit Sur, near 'Ain ed-Dirweh; the name was first heard byAATolcott. For- tified by Rehoboam (2 Chr. XI, 7) ; by Judas Mace. (1 Mace. IV, 29, 61 ; 2 Mace. XI, 5); taken by Antiochus Eupator (1 Mace. AT, 31, 50); besieged by Jonathan Mace. (1 Mace. IX, 52; X, 14). Taken and fortified by Simon Mace. (1 Mace. XI, 65, 66 ; XIV, 7, 33). It was the reputed site of the baptism of the Eu- nuch (Acts VIII, 26-40). (Wdson I, 386; Rabbi Schwartz, p. 107; Lat. Bibl. Res. 277.) Betonim, city of Gad (Josh. XIII, 26) ; probably identical with a ruin called Batneh, on the mountains between Wady Sha'ib and AVady Ajliin. Bikath-Aven, \u00abthe plain of idols.. (Amos I, 5), mentioned in connection with Syria and Damascus; evidently the present el-Biika.'a or plain of Coelesyria (Maundrell under 25, 26 April) ; the same which is caded the valley of Lebanon in Josh. XI, 17 and XII, 7 (comp. Bibl. Sacra 1843, p. 84, 85). Bozrah (of Moab), mentioned in connection with Beth-gamul and Ke- rioth (Jer. XLVIII, 2 1 -24). Porter identifies it with Busrah;"], [311, "299 extensive ruins in tbe plain at the S. W. extremity of Jebel Ha'uran (Five years etc. II, 161). It seems, however, difficult to understand how Moab had extended so far North. At the same time it is evident, that Bozrah of Edom (Bosor, Onom.) is distinct from the former Bozrah. Bozrah oi Edom (mentioned in Isa. XXXIV, 6; XLIII, 1; Jer. XLIX, 7-22 ; Amos I, 12) was identified by Burck hardt with Busseira , 2 hours S. of AVady Tiifileh (v. Raumer p. 243; Ritter XV, 127; XIV, 993, 101-102 sq.). Bozrah (Busrah) seems also to be referred to in 1 Mace. V, 26-28 (comp. Jos. Ant. XII, 8, 3). It is the Bostra of the Greeks and Romans (Winer, art. Bozra). Reland identifies Busrah with Beeshterah a Levitical city belonging to the half tribe of Manasseh. Biisrah is fully described by Porter II, 112\u2014159. Byblos, see Gebal. Cabul, a city of Asher (Josh. XIX, 27) ; perhaps the same as Chabolo of Josephus, a vdlage 40 stadia AV. of Jotapata (Joseph, vita \u00a7 43 \u2014 45 ; Reland, Pal. p. 701), the same with the present vil- lage of Kabul N.W. of Jefat , at the distance mentioned by Jo- sephus . Caesarea (Palaestinae or Maritima), formerly Stratonis turn's, 600 stadia from Jerusalem (Bell. Jud. I, 3, 5) ; on the coast between Dora and Joppe (Ant. XIII, 11, 2; XV, 9, 6; XVI, 5, 1 ; B. J. I, 21, 5; III, 9, 1; Plin. H. N. V, 13); the master-piece of Herod the Great's architectural achievements. Here Philip the evangelist, the apostle Paul, Cornelius the centurion (Acts VIII, 40; IX, 30; X, 1, 23, 24; XI, 11; XVIII, 21, 22; XXI, 7, 8; XXIII, 23\u201433; XXIV\u2014 XXVI). After the destruction of Jerusalem the city is for nearly 400 years the Metropolis of Palestine ; during the Crusaders' dominion it ranks under the Latin bishopric of Jerusalem. It was never rebudt after having been destroyed by the Saracens. Now extensive ruins called Kaisariyeh. (See Ritter XVI, 598 sq. ; von Prokesch, Reise etc. p. 28 \u2014 34; AVdsonll, 250--253 ; Le Pays d'lsrael , pi. 50, Winer, art. Caesarea.) Caesarea \u25a0 Philippi , a town visited by the Lord Jesus (Matth. XVI, 13 ; Mark. VIII, 27) ; at the fountain of the Jordan issuing from the' grotto of Pan, and hence called Panium and Paneas. Here Herod built a temple in honour of Augustus (Jos. Ant. XV, 10, 3). Later it belonged to thetetrarchy of Philip, and being en- larged and embellished , was called Caesarea-Philippi to distin- guish it from Caesarea on the sea-coast (Ant. XVIII, 2, 1 ; B. J. Ill 98; VII, 2, 1); called Neronias by Agrippa ; also called Caesarea-Pane'as ,' whence the present name Banias. It was a bishopric of Phenicia till the conquest of the land by Omar. For"], [312, "300 its further history and other particulars see Winer, art. Caesarea; v. Raumer p. 215; Wilson II, 175 sq. ; Thomson in Bibl. Sacra 1846, p. 187, 194 sq.; Porter, Five years &c. I, 307 sq.; Later Bibl. Res. p. 397 sq. The city was called Bclinas by the Crusaders. Von Raumer identifies Banias also with Baal-gad, city \u00abin the valley of Lebanon*. \u2014 \u00abat the foot of Hermon.. (Josh. XI, 17; XII , 7 ; XIII , 5) , the same which is caded Baal-Hermon in Judg. Ill, 3 and 1 Chr. A^, 23 (see also Lat. Bibl. Res. p. 400, 410). Yet it cannot be said that Banias is situated in the valley of Lebanon, and Baal-gad would seem to have been, although at the entrance of, yet in that valley. The site of the ruins Kul'at Bostra or Kul'at Aisafa (perhaps from Azebed ..idol\" Heb., see Ps. XAT , 4) would answer better the Scriptural conditions of Baal-gad's locality. Banias on the other hand seems to corre spond in its situation to Beth-Rehob , a city in a vadey close by Lais or Dan, the present Ted el-Kady (Judg. XVIII, 28). In 2 Sam. X, 6 it occurs as a city of the Syrians, and would thus likely be situated on the E. side ofthe upper Jordan, the Nahr Hasbany. Its name signifying \u00abopen space\u00bb in the sense of con trast to \u00abenelosure\u00bb is just what forms the peculiar feature in the situation of Banias at the base of the gigantic cluster of moun tains towering round the central mass of Hermon; here the mountains and mountain-gorges end and the wide expanse of the Huleh plain opens before it. Banias , on the great Damascus route would naturally belong to Syria , and would also suit as a place to mark the dmits of the country , which the spies had to travel through (Num. XIII, 21). This Rehob and Beth-Rehob is, however, distinct from that mentioned in Josh. XIX, 28, 30; XXI, 31 and Judg. I, 31, which, from the signification of its name and the order in which it is mentioned , should be sought for at one of the numerous ruins at the S.E. base of Jebel Miishakka, where the mountain-country opens upon the wide plain of Akka. Cain, a city of Judah ; seems identical with Yukin, a village S.E. of Hebron. Instances of transposition of letters as occurs in these names , are frequent ; and the position agrees with the enume- ration of Josh. XV, 57 between the more Southern cities of Jezreel, &c. (verse 56), and Halhul, Bethzur, &c. (verse 58) situated to the North. Calamon, see Sycaminos (Hepha). Callirhoe, famous hot baths on the E. side of the Dead Sea (Bed. Jud. I, 33, 5; Plin. H. N. V, 15; Ptolem. V, 16, p. 141); visited and identified by Seetzen (Reise II, 336 sq.) with either"], [313, "301 the hot springs in AVady Zerka Ma'in or with those on its Sou thern side near the ruins Sara (Ritter XV, 572, 573). Cana, a town of Galilee, where the Lord Jesus wrought his first mi- racle (John II, 1, 11; IV, 46); NathanaeTs birth-place (ib. XXI, 2) ; identified by Robinson with Kana el-Jelil, now a ruin, at the foot of the mountains on the N. side of the plain el-Biittauf; about 2 hours from Sepphoris (Bibl. Res. Ill, 204 and Later B. R. p. 108). Capercotia (Caporcotani ofthe Peut. Tables. 28 R. m. from Caesarea and 21 from Scythopolis) ; mentioned by Ptolemy IV, 16 (Bibl. Res. Ill, 158, Note XLI); now the village Kefr Kud , about, 1% hour AV. of Jenin. It is situated on an eminence and a high wely N. of the vdlage, called Shekh Zeit, is visible from a great distance all around. Capernaum, city on the Lake of Galdee (Luke IV, 31) ; on the bor- ders of Zebulon and Naphtali (Matth. IA7, 13; XI, 23; John AT, 17); on the great high-way from Damascus to Palestine, the so called via maris ; the place where Jesus dwelt and taught (Matth. XVII, 24 &c. ; John VI, 59; comp. Matth. IX, 1; Marc. II, 1). Robinson identifies it with Khan Miniyeh Bibl. Res. Ill, 288 sq.; Lat. B. R. p. 348 sq.); chiefly on the grounds , 1 . that Capernaum lay in the plain (or the land; of Gennesaret, the present el-Ghuweir on the AV. side ofthe lake (which he infers from a comparison of Matth. XIV, 13 \u2014 36 with Marc. AT, 32 \u2014 54, and John VI, 1\u201425) ; 2. that the vil- lage Kepharnome , mentioned by Josephus, must be adjacent to the fountain Kapharnaum in the plain of Gennesaret, and that this fountain must be the 'Ain et-Tin , near Khan Miniyeh on the shore (Jos. vita \u00a7 52, 54, 59, 62, 6S \u2014 73); 3. that AVil- libald, who visited the Holy Land about the middle of the eighth century, mentions Tiberias, Magdala, Capernaum, Beth Saida, Chorazin and the Jordan as visited in succession by him on his journey N. along the Lake. The arguments , which Robinson adds besides the above, seem to us of minor importance, and one of them, the testimony of Brocardus, who says that one league to the East of a fountain , \u00abwhich some dream to be a vein of the Nde>. , is the city of Capernaum , would turn right against Ro- binson instead of in his favour, if Brocardus holds that fountain, as Robinson himself does , to be the 'Ain et-Tin. This is even likely, for Brocardus says , that Jesus appeared to his disciples '\u2022at twenty paces from the fountain and by the lake... That Capernaum and Beth Saida were situated near one an- other, is evidently intimated in the gospel narratives , but not that Capernaum was in the land of Gennesaret. To assume that Kepharnome, whither Josephus was carried when wounded, was"], [314, "302 so far from the Jordan, near to which this accident occurred, as Khan Miniyeh , and again that his Kepharnome and fountain Kapharnaum must needs be adjacent to one another requires a host of suppositions, which we do not feel justified to accept from Robinson. Of all the arguments , which that learned traveller brings forth, that of AVillibald's testimony seems to us to be the most weighty , and yet to the utmost it goes only so far as to prove, which place in his days was considered as Capernaum. Robinson has too wed exposed, in many other cases, the little re liance, which in general can be placed upon tradition, to impress us in this particular case with much confidence in the same. Besides , Arculfus , so Robinson quotes , says that Capernaum \u00abextended a long way upon the shore from West to East, having the mountain on the N. and the lake on the S... This description cannot refer to Khan Miniyeh, which lies North and South, having the mountains AVest and the lake East , but points clearly out to the ruins now called Ted-Hum , situated \u00aban hour East (rather N.E.) of the fountain.) ('Ain Tin'?)', as Brocardus says. The position of Ted-Hum seems to us to agree in every respect with the gospel narrative, being near, not in, the land of Genne saret, and not too far from the East side of the Lake to adow people to follow Jesus on foot, whilst He was crossing the water with His disciples (John VI, 2). That position would also make Kepharnome a near and convenient resting-place for Josephus, when he was ill ; and its name , although it may be a borrowed one, may also be the remains of its ancient appellation. Decisive it would be, if there could be found traces of the ancient via maris ; and to future travellers the research after these are re commended. (See also Ritter XV, 339 sq. ; AVdson II, 139 sq.) Caphar Barucha, \u00abthe village of benediction..; to this place, so Je- rome mentions, Abraham accompanied the Lord Gen. XVIII, 33; also XIX, 27, 28) ; Robinson identifies it with Beni-na'im, a village E. of Hebron (Bibl. Res. II, 189). Caphar Zacharia, city mentioned by Sozomenos (Hist. Eccles. IX, 17, in Ritter XVI , 119); different from Beit Zacharia of Josephus ; now Kefr Zakaria, on the N. side of Wady Sumt over against Tell Zakaria (Narr. II, 192). Capitolias, episcopal city of the second Palestine (Reland, Pal. p. 215); 16 R. m. from Gadara, 36 from Neve (Nawa) (Itiner. Anton.); 16 R. m. from Adraha (Edrei) (Tab. Peut.). The first and last distances seem to fix Capitolias at the present Beit er- Ras , where Burckhardt found extensive ruins. The distance from Nawa is, however, too great, unless by a round-about way. In measuring the 1 6 R. m. from Edrei , the passing of the deep"], [315, "303 Wady Shelaleh should be taken into account. Von Raumer pro poses to identify Capitolias with Tseil, as, in Berghaus' map, that place is 16 R. m. from Gadara. According to our map this distance is 26 R. m. ; nor is there any warrant to read 6 instead of 36 R. m. for the distance between Capitolias and Neve (Itin. Anton.). Carmel, city of Judah (Josh. XV, 55) ; 10 R. m. to the E. of Hebron (Onom.); now Kurmul, extensive ruins about 2% hours S. of Hebron ; remains of a castle , large reservoir , &c. ; visited by Seetzen 1807 (Reise III, p. 8, 9); by Robinson 1838 (B. R. II, 195 sq.). On the E. side of the ruins is a steep descent. Here Saul's victorious monument (1 Sam. XXV, 2) ; Nabal and Abigail (1 Sam. XXVII, 3). Later a place of a Roman garrison; King Amalrich here encamped 1172; since then it seems to have been forgotten. Carmel (Mount) .(the mountain of the fruitful fields*. , or \u00abthe well- wooded mountain*. (Stanley p. 486) ; a long mountain-ridge pro- jecting N.AV. to the sea and forming the bay of 'Akka ; on the S.AV. side it has several spurs running to the coast in a nearly paradel direction. Asher' s boundary passed over Carmel (Josh. XIX, 26); the scene of Elijah's sacrifice (1 Kings XATII) ; Elisha' s dwelling-place (2 K. II, 25; IV, 25); referred to by the prophets (Isa. XXXIII, 9; XXXV, 2; Jer. XL VI , 18; L, 19; Amos I, 2; IX, 3; Mic. ATI, 14; Nah. I, 4 ; see also Cant. ATI, 5). For the ((excellency of Carmel. and the site of the sacrifice, el-Mohraka, see Narrat. I, 316 - 330. Castellum Peregrinorum, or Petra incisa, fortified sea-port of the Cru- saders between cape Carmel and Caesarea (Ritter XVI, 615; v. Raumer p. 133) ; now Athlit, a most formidable looking ruin, inhabited by a few poor people (Narr. I, 312 \u2014 314). Cedron (the brook), winter-torrent in the deep vadey between Jeru- salem and the mount of Olives (2 Sam. XV, 23; Neh. II, 15; Joh. XVIII, 1) ; now Wady Kidron; lower down it has different names ; its chief name is AV. en-Nar. Chalsis under Lebanon, a city mentioned by Josephus in connection with Heliopolis (B. J. I, 9, 2; Ant. XIV, 7, 4 ; ib. 3, 2 ; XIX, 5, 1 ; ib. 8, 1 ; XX, 1, 3; B. J. II, 12, 1 ; Ant. XX, 7, 1 ; and by Strabo XVI , 2, 10, p. 753, 755;. Now considerable ruins near 'Anjar or Mejdel Anjar, about 3 hours S. of Zahleh (Thomson in Bibl. Sacra 1848, p. 761 ; Seetzen, Reisel, p. 262 ; Porter, I, 14\u201416; Lat. Bibl. Res. p. 497, 498). Chephirah, city of the Gibeonites , assigned to Benjamin (Josh. IX, 1 7 : XATII, 26 ; Ezra II, 25 ; Neh. ATI, 29) ; now a ruin called"], [316, "304 Kefir, on the heights S. of AVady Soleiman , about one hour E. of Yalo. Cherith (the brook), see Phasaelis. Chesalon, or Mount- Jearim, border-city of Judah between Kirjath- jearim and Beth-Shemesh (Josh. XV, 10) ; now the village Kesla, S.AV. of Kuriet el-Enab, on the high S. bank of AATady Ghurab. (Bibl, Res. II, 364.) Chinnereth (the sea of), Num. XXXIV, 11; Josh. XIII, 27; the lake of Gennesaret (Luke V, 1) ; the Sea of Galilee (Matth. XV, 29 ; Marc. VII, 31 ; John VI, 1) ; the Sea of Tiberias (John VI, 1 ; XXI, 1); now Bahr Tubariyeh (AViner, art. Genezareth). The name Chinnereth or Gennesaret seems to be from a town in the fertile plain (el-Ghuweir) on the W. side of the lake , belonging to Naphtali (Josh. XI, 2; XIX, 35; 1 Kings XV, 20). The name may be derived from Gani gardens) and Sar (Prince) (.gar- dens of Princes.. (Stanley, p. 370). It is hard to say which of the ruins in the Ghuweir are those of Chinnereth. Chisloth -tabor, city on the borders of Zebulon and Issachar (Josh. XIX. 12); Chesulloth (Josh. XIX, IS); 8 R. m. East of Diocae- sarea (Onom.) ; Chasalos or Exalus of Josephus (B. J. Ill, 3, 1 ; vita \u00a7 44) ; now the village Iksal, S.AAr. of mount Tabor. Chobai or Choba, mentioned in Judith XV, 4, 5. in connection with Dothan and Bethuliah ; probably the same with the present Kii- batiyeh , a village 1 % hour S. of Jenin on the high -way 'to Sebustiyeh (Narrat. I, 368; also Stewart, p. 421, 422). Chorazin, city near Capernaum and Bethsaida (Matth. XI, 21 ; Luke X, 13) ; 2 R. m. from Capernaum upon the shore of the lake (Jerome). Keith identifies it with a mass of ruins, which he vi- sited at 50' distance N.W. from Capernaum (Tell - Hum) and called Kerazeh (Evidences of the truth of the Christian religion) . Robinson did not visit the ruins but Bir Kerazeh , a small foun- tain of bad water, a mile further N.E. in the same valley. Keith describes the ruins as considerable ; there are \u00abseveral pedestals of columns*, in their original position, -(but the shafts are levelled \u00abwith the ground and intermingled with the fallen dwellings... He also mentions \u00abthe remains of a budding formed of large hewn stones.., &c. Robinson must, therefore, have been wrongly informed by his guide, as he says, the ruins \u00abconsist simply of a \u00abfew foundations of black stones ; the remains evidently of a .poor and inconsiderable village;)) and again : (.the remains are \u00abtoo trivial to have ever belonged to a place of any importance.) (Lat. B. R. p. 347)."], [317, "305 I Coelesyria; thus the great valley between Lebanon and Antilebanon is called (Strabo XAT, 754, 756; 2 Mace. X , 11). Compare AViner, art. Coelesyrien. Como-Chara, also Chonachara, Comoara, Khomokara, Khara, episcopal city mentioned in the Notit. Eccles. Identified by Porter (Five years Ssc. -I, 107 ; II, 362) - from an Arabic M. S. by Maca- rius, patriarch of Antioch , containing an account of the seven general councils \u2014 with the vdlage Kara on the great Damascus- Homs road between Nebk and Hasya. Conna, a town mentioned in the Itin. Anton, (ed. Parthey et Pinder) on the way from Heliopolis to Emesa (Horns) , 32 R. m. from the former. Identified by Thomson in Bibl. Sacra 1848, p. 699. with el-Ka a (see also Ritter XVII, 169, 170). Robinson, how- ever, holds er-Ras to be the same with Conna (Lat. Bibl. Res., p. 534 \u2014 536), also identical with Cunna or Cuma of the Notitia Dignitatum. The many ruins of churches and convents at er-Ras plead for Robinson's identification. The distance from Ba'albec, however , is not quite so exactly corresponding with the figures ofthe Itin. Anton, as Dr. Robinson imagines (see our Map). In this respect Thomson's supjDosition seems to be more correct. That Conna should also be Chonachara of the Notitia Eccles., as Robinson thinks, seems very doubtful (see Porter, Five years &e. II, 362). Coreae, mentioned by Joseph, in his notice of Pompey's march from Da- mascus to Jerusalem, as in the Northern part of Judea (Ant. XIV, 3,4; B. J. I, 6, 5). Vespasian marches to it from Neapolis in one day, and the next to Jericho (B. J. IV, 8, 1) ; now Kuriut, village 30' N. by E. of Shdoh (Bibl. Res. Ill, 83; Ritter XV, 455). Visited by E. G. Schultz; by AVoleott (Bibl. Sac. 1843, p. 72). The place is smad with no very definite traces of antiquity. Coreathe, an episcopal city of Trachonitis mentioned in the Notit. Eccles.; now probably Kir&tah , on the Southern edge of the Lejah (Ritter XV, 866; S. Paulo, Geogr. Sac. Not. Ant. p. 51 ; Reland, Pal. 218; Porter II, 216). Culon, or Koulon, one of the eleven cities interpolated by the LXX between Josh. XV, 59 and 60; now probably Kiilonieh, a vil- lage with ancient remains , about 1 % hour W. of Jerusalem on the road to Yafa (Lat. Bibl. Res. p. 158; Keil , Comm. Josh. p. 388). Daberath, city of Zebulon (Josh. XIX, 12), given to the Levites (Josh. XXI, 28 ; 1 Chr. AT, 58) ; now the village Deburieh at the AVestern base of mount. Tabor. Dalmanutha, see Migdal-el. van de Velde, Holy Land. 20"], [318, "306 Damascus , now esh-Sham, the ancient capital of Syria ; the capital of a Pashalik of that name; 150 to 160,000 inhabitants.

Northern frontier-city of Palestine (Judg. XX, 1; 1 Sam. Ill, 20; XXX, 30; 2 Sam. XVII, 1 I ; comp. Jer. IV, 15, 16; VIII, 16); one of the two sites of Jeroboam's idolatry (1 Kings XII, 28, 29 ; 2 Kings X, 29 ; Amos VIII, 13, 14) ; taken by Benhadad (1 Kings XV, 20 ; 2 Chr. XAT, 4); here one of the sources of the Jordan (Jos. Ant. I, 10, 1 ; V, 3, 1 ; VIII, 8, 4 ; B. J. FV, 1, 1); now Tell el-Kady, about one hour AATest of Banias ; (\u00ab4 R. m. from Paneas on the road to Tyre, where the source of the Jordan is\u00bbOnom.) ; the ruins of the town are chiefly on the S. side of the ted (Lat. B. R. p. 392) , but Burckhardt heard of foundations (Trav. in Syria p. 42) and Porter saw scattered stones, which appeared to have been once used in buddings on the N. and N.AA7. side of the ted (Five years &c. I, 303); the latter also recognized the foundations of a wall on the ted. Danaba, a city mentioned by Ptolemy (Geogr. V, 15); seat of a bishopric (Notit. Eccles.) ; identified by Porter (Five years &c. I, 346 \u2014 from an Arabic Manuscript written in the seventh century by Maca- rius, bishop of Aleppo and later patriarch of Antioch), with Said- naya, now a large village at the foot of Antilebanon, with a con- vent and extensive ruins. Dan-jaan. Here came the men sent by David to number the people (2 Sam. XXIV, 6). Identified by Dr. E. G. Schultz with Danian or Danyal , a very ancient ruin, on the mountains above Khan en-Nakura (between Tyre and 'Akka) . Daphne, a place mentioned by Josephus near Dan, on the N. side of the Huleh-marshes (B. J. IV , 1, 1) ; now a low tell with the remains of an ancient town, two mdes S. of Tell el-Kady; the place is recognized from afar by a group of trees , which over- shadows it. The tell bears yet the name of Dufneh (Narrat. II, 419; see also Later Bibl. Res. p. 393 and Wilson II, 172)."], [319, "307 Dead Sea, now Bahr Lut \u00abthe sea of Lot., (see the chapter on Routes and Distances; also Narrat. II, 69 \u2014 77, 99 \u2014 126). Seetzen's Reise II, p. 362 \u2014 366, 378 contain much information about the E. side of this lake, which in future explorations may be useful. Debir, Kirjath-Sannah or Kirjath-Sepher, one of the royal Canaanitish cities (Josh. XII, 13) ; conquered by Joshua (Josh. X, 38, 39) ; city of Judah (Josh. XV, 49) in the mountains; Levitical city (Josh. XXI, 15; 1 Chr. VI, 58); conquered by Othniel (Josh. XV , 14 \u2014 19); probably identical with the ruin Dilbeb , on the summit of a hill N. of Wady Ddbeh and of the road from edh- Dhoheriyeh to Hebron, at about 2 hours S.AAr. of the latter. Dr. Stewart mentions these ruins as having a fine spring, the water of which is brought down by an aqueduct to Birket-ed- Dilbeh at the foot of the said hill. This description agrees well with the upper and nether springs of Judg. I, 14, 15. The vicinity of Hebron and also the name would further plead in favour of the identification , which was proposed by that tra- veder (Stewart, p. 223, 224). The ruins of Daumeh (see Du- mah) must be very near those of Dilbeh. Deleda, or Theleda of the Tab. Peut. Ritter (XVII, 1443) identifies it with Hasya , a village on the Damascus-Horns road , 4 hours E. of Riblah. Dibon, orDimon, city of the Amorites, conquered by Israel (Num. XXI, 30; XXXIII, 45; Josh. XIII, 9); assigned to Gad and Reuben (Num. XXXII, 34; Josh. XIII, 17); belongs later to Moab (Isa. XV, 29; Jer. XLATII, 22); now Dhiban, a ruin nearly 2 hours N. of the Arnon, in the plain of el-Kura, visited by Seetzen and Burckhardt. Dionysias, ecclesiastical city of Arabia (S. Paulo, Geogr. Sac. p. 497; Not. Eccl. p. 50; Reland, Pal. p. 218). Porter thinks, that it might be the modern Shuhba , N. of Kunawat, with ex- tensive ruins (Ritter XV, 883 ; Five years &c. II, 80). Doch, castle near Jericho, where Simon Maccabaeus was murdered by Ptolemy (1 Mace. XVI, 14, 15 ; Jos. Ant. XIII, 8, 1 ; B. J. I, 2, 3). Robinson found traces of ancient substructions near 'Ain Duk , above the fountain , which he supposes to mark the site of Doch (Bibl. Res. II, 309). Dor, royal Canaanitish city, adotted to Manasseh (Josh. XI, 2; XII, 23- XVII, 11 ; Judg. I, 27); here one of Solomon's governors (1 Kings IV, 11); strong fortress (I Mace. XV, 11 \u2014 14, 25; Jos. Ant. XIII, 7, 2; XIV, 4, 4; 5, 3); later episcopal city; now Tantura, a village on the coast, 2% hours N. of Kaisariyeh. The ruins of the ancient city are a mile N. of the vidage. 20*"], [320, "308 Doroa, an ancient town, now the vdlage Dur , on the S. side ofthe Lejah. The identity was proved from an inscription found by Seetzen (Ritter XV, 868). Dothan, a city 12 R. m. North of Samaria (Onom.). Here Joseph was sold by his brethren (Gen. XXXVII) ; Elisha shut in by the Syrian army (2 Kings VI, 13\u201419). Mentioned also in the siege of Bethuliah (Judith III, 9 ; IV, 6 ; VII, 3, 18); its site is now marked by Tell Dothan, a large ted with a ruined aqueduct and other remains of antiquity at its base , in the position given by the Onom. (Narr. I, 364-369). Dumah, mountain-city of Judah (Josh. XV, 52), 17 R. m. from Beit- Jibrin (Onom.), seems to be the same with Daumeh, a ruin in AVady Dilbeh (Bibl. Res. I, 314). The distance from Beit-Jibrin agrees well with the Onom., making, of course , allowance for slow travelling in the mountains. Ebal (mount) , opposite mount Gerizim ; referred to in Deut. XI, 29; XXVII, 4, 13; Josh. VIII, 30. Having less attractive Samaritan associations than mount Gerizim , few traveders at- tempt its ascent. Edomia, or Edumia, a city mentioned in the Onom., as situated 12 R. m. East of Neapolis in Acrabattene ; now the village Daumeh, not E. but S.E. by E. from Nabulus (Narr. II, 308). Edrei, the capital of Bashan ; belonging to Manasseh (Num. XXI, 33 ; Deut. I, 4; III, 10; Josh. XII, 4; XIII, 31); Adraa of the Onom., 25 R. m. from Bostra and 6 from Ashtaroth ; Adraha ofthe Tab.Peut., 24 R. m. from Bostra; now the vdlage Der'a, on the S. banks of AVady ed-Dan, at the distance from Busrah as the Onom. has it. Porter holds Edhr'a to be identical with Edrei (Five years &e. II, 222 sq.). Eglon, rojral Canaanitish city (Josh. XII, 12); conquered by Joshua on his way from Lachish to Hebron (ib. X, 23 \u2014 27 , 36, 37) ; city of Judah in the plain (ib. XV, 39); erroneously identified in the Onom. with Adullam; now 'Ajlan, a low mound with a few scattered building-stones , on the way from Gaza to Beit- Jibrin , about one hour East of Lachish (Um-Lakhis). (Bibl. Res. II, 392.) Ekron, city of Dan, on the borders of Judah (Josh. XV, 11, 45; XIX, 43; Judg. I, 18; comp. Josh. XIII, 3); here the ark of the covenant, (1 Sam. V, 10); in possession ofthe Philistines, but taken again by Israel (1 Sam. VII, 14 ; XVII, 52) ; devoted to the idolatry of Baal (2 Kings 1 , 2 , 3) ; prophecies against Ekron (Jer. II, 20; Amos I, 8 ; Zeph. II, 4; Zech. IX, 5-7); in Jerome's days a vidage (Onom. art. Accaron) ; now the village"], [321, "309 of 'Akir, between Beit-Jibrin and Yafa (Bibl. Res.

Elealeh, or Elealah, city of Reuben (Num. XXXII, 3, 37); later under Moab (Isa. XV, 4; XAT, 9; Jer. XLATII, 34); one R. m. from Heshbon (Euseb.). The ruins of Elealah were discovered by Burckhardt and also by Seetzen ; they are now called el-' Al. Eleutheropolis (Onom.); Betogabra (Ptolemy XVI, 4); Betogab/i (Tab. Peut. 16 R. in. from Askelon); Bethgebrim, also Geberin of the Crusaders ; identified with great care by Robinson and Smith (Bibl. Res. II, 401 \u2014 420, 642 sq.) with the modern Beit-Jibrin. Elkosh, the native place of the prophet Nahum (Nah. I, 1) ; is sup- posed by some to be Alkilsh , 12 mdes above Mossul on the banks of the Tigris, where his grave is shewn; according to Jerome, however, a place in Gadlee. A village of the name el- Kauzah is found about 2% hours S.W. of Tibnin: this seems to correspond with Jerome's notice. Another village of that name. also an ancient site, lies on a high hill rather more than 2 hours S. of Nablous (see AViner, art. Elkosch; Prof. Edwards in Bibl. Sacra 1848, p. 557 - 558). Elusa, recognized by Robinson and Smith in the ruins el-Khiilasah, about 5 hours S.S.AV. of Hebron on the way to Egypt. In the Tab. Peut. Elysa 7 1 R. m. Southward from Jerusalem. Epis- copal city of the Third Palestine (Reland, Pal. p. 755 sq.; Ritter XIV, 120; Bibl. Res. I, 296 sq. ; Stewart 205). Emmaus (Nicopolis), 22 R. m. from Jerusalem, 10 from Lydda (Itin. Hieros). Referred to in 1 Mace. Ill, 40, 57; IV, 3, 14, 15; IX, 50; Jos. Ant. XIII, 1, 3; XIV, 11, 2; XVII, 10, 9; B. J. Ill, 3 , 5- Held by Eusebius and Jerome to be the Em- maus of Luke XXIV, 13 \u2014 35, 60 stadia from Jerusalem. In the commencement of the 1 4\"' century the latter Emmaus was identified with the village el-Kubeibeh, about 2% hours N.AV. of Jerusalem, with ruins of a convent and church (Tobler, Top. II, 540). The distance from Jerusalem to Nicopolis, the present 'Amwas near the entrance of W. 'Aly , does not agree with that oi Emmaus as given by S' Luke. Robinson (Lat. Bibl. Res. p. 1 48) inclines to the opinion, that the distance ought to be read 160 instead of 60 stadia, as ..several Manuscripts, and some of them of high authority.) read here 160. This would point to the present 'Amwas . which is 176 stadia distant. But the gospel"], [322, "310 narrative does not at all imply so forced a march as would be required for going the long distance of 5 hours down from Je rusalem, and up again in 6 hours time, by a very difficult road. Indeed without much forcing the whole history contained in the 24\"' ch. of Luke this supposition seems perfectly inadmissible. The position of el-Kubeibeh answers tolerably well to that of the New Test. Emmaus (see v. Raumer p. 169). Ephraim, see Ophrah. En-dor, a town of Manasseh (Josh. XVII, 11); in the plain of Jizreel (1 Sam. XXVIII, 7) ; 4 R. m. South of Tabor (Onom.) ; now the village Endur, with traces of antiquity and large natural caves. En-gannim, Levitical town of Issachar (Josh. XIX, 21; XXI, 29); held by Robinson (Bibl. Res. Ill, 156), and also AVilson (Lands of the Bible II, 84) to be identical with Ginaea of Josephus (Ant. XX, 6, 1 ; B. J. Ill, 3, 4; also II, 12, 3), and with the present town of Jenin at the Southern extremity of the plain of Esdraelon. Engedi , a town of Judah in the desert near the Dead Sea (Josh. XV, 62; Ezek. XLVII, 10; comp. 1 Sam. XXIV, 1 , 2) ; called Hazezon-tamar in Gen. XIV, 7 ; 2 Chr. XX, 2 ; often referred to by Josephus ; also noticed in the Onom. ; identified with the ruins near the spring called 'Ain Jidy , on the AV. coast of the Dead Sea. The place was first visited in modern times by Seetzen 1805. See also Bibl. Res. II, 209\u2014214. En-Rogel, a spring, which formed a boundary-mark between Judah and Benjamin (Josh. XV , 7 ; XVIII, 16; 2 Sam. XVII, 17; 1 Kings I, 9) ; now Bir Eyub (Joab's well) from the conspiracy and the feast of Adonijah (1 Kings I); at the place where the valleys of Ben Hinnom and of the Cedron meet below Jerusalem. En-Shemesh , \u00abthe fountain of the Sum. , boundary-mark between Ju- dah and Benjamin (Josh. XV, 7 ; XVIII, 17) ; is held to be the same with Bir el-Khot, the so called wed of the Apostles, 2(i E.N.E. of Bethany (Tobler, Top. II, 400; Keil, Comm. Josh. p. 365). Eshcol (The valley of), near Hebron, from whence the spies brought the large cluster of grapes (Num. XIII, 23, 24; XXXII, 9,. The valley N. of Hebron has a fountain, about 15 or 20' from the city, yet called 'Ain Eskali. (Information given at Hebron, see Narrat. II, 64.) (Dr. Zunz on Benjamin of Tudela, Asher's Edition.) Eshean, mountain-city of Judah (Josh. XV, 52); probably the same which is caded Ashan in 1 Chr. IAr, 32 ; but different from Ashan in the plain of Josh. XV, 12: and probably also the same with"], [323, "311 Chor- ashan of 1 Sam. XXX, 30, which seems to be identical with the ruins of Kursa (Khirzah in Bibl. Res., App. II p. 1 16). About 2% hours S. AV. of Hebron. Stewart also mentions these ruins as Khoursa. (The tent etc. p. 224.) Eshtemoh, mountain-city of Judah (Josh. XV, 50; XXI, 14; 1 Sam. XXX, 28); Robinson identifies it with the present vidage of Semua, nearly 3 hours S. of Hebron (Bibl. Res. II, 194, 627). Etam, city of Judah, fortified by Rehoboam (2 Chr. XI, 6) ; 60 stadia from Jerusalem, in a beautiful locality with copious springs (Jos. Ant. VIII, 7, 3 ; 10, 1) ; probably now the ruins at the village of Urtas, S. of Bethlehem and near Solomon's reservoirs (Bibl. Res. I, 515). Another Etam seems the one mentioned in I Chr. IV, 3, 32, in connection with Rimmon near Ramath-Lehi in the Southern part of \u00abthe plain\u00bb ; evidently the same whither Samson retired (Judg. XV, 8, 11, 13), and called the rock Etam. We have to look for this rock somewhere to the N. AV. and not far from Tell Khewelfeh. Ether, city of Judah, in the plain (Josh. XV, 42) ; assigned to the lot of Simeon Josh. XIX, 7). Arabic version 'Athar. \u2014 Among the names of ruins and ancient sites given us by the people at Beit- Jibrin was Ted 'Athar. But its direction and distance from Beit- Jibrin we could not ascertain (see Remarks on Section 7 of the Map). Ether and Jattir in the mountains are confused in the Onomasticon. Gabara, a city of Galdee, 20 stadia from Sogane (Joseph, vita \u00a7 51 ; Relandp. 1120) ; the ruins of which were found by E.G. Schultz ; they are called Kubiirah , and situated to the N. of Sukhnin (Sogane) at the distance mentioned by the Jewish Historian (Ritter XVI, 769). Josephus speaks elsewhere of it as Gabaroth (see the remarks on Gabara in Lat. B. R. p. 87). Gabatha, a town mentioned in the Onom. in the borders of Dioeae- sarea, near the plain of Esdraelon; now the village of Jebata, N. ofthe Kishon river, where Euseb. and Jerome place it. (Ritter XVI, 748.) Gadara, the capital of the district called \"the country of the Gada- renes\u00bb (Marc. V, 1; Luke VIII, 26); \u00abof the Gergesenes\u00bb (Matth. VIII 28). Thomson explains this double designation from the cir- cumstance that according to Origen a city Gergasa existed on the E. side of Lake Tiberias, where now the ruins Girsa are found (New- York Observer, February 1858), which he visited, and that the country by Matthew is called after that city and by tbe other Evangelists after the capital Gadara. Identical with Um-Keis, on the high Southern banks of the N. Yarmuk (Burckhardt, Trav."], [324, "312 p. 270-274). See Joseph. Ant. XIII, 13, 3; 15, 4; XIV, 4, 4 5, 1; XV, 7, 3; XVII, 11, 4, etc.; Reland, p. 301, 773 sq. Galilee , in the Old Testament a district of Naphtali, to which Kedesh belonged, and which was chiefly inhabited by Gentiles (Josh. XX, 7 ; XXI, 32 ; 1 Kings IX, 11; 2 Kings XV, 29 ; Isa. IX, 1 ; 1 Chr. VI, 76); in the days of Jesus Galilee was the name given to all Northern Palestine on the W. side of Jordan (Luke VIII, 26; XVII, 11; Acts IX, 31). See also Josephus B. J. II, IS, 9 ; 20, 6 ; III, 3, 1 ; Ant. V, 1. 22 ; XX, 6, 1 ; vita \u00a7 37, \u00a7 45 ; AViner, art. Galilda. Gamala, a strong fortress, on a mountain on the E. side of the Lake of Galdee, over against Tarichea (Jos. B. J. IV, 1, 1-7; 9, 10; III, 3, 5) ; generally held to be the same with Kul'at el-Husn above AVady Fik. Ritter observes (XV, 353), that as Josephus mentions a large plain to the back of the fortress, the position of K. el-Husn does not \u00a3gree with that of Gamala. He holds the fortress rather identical with Khan el -'Akabah, chiefly from Seetzen's description of the latter. Gath-hepher, city of Zebulon (Josh. XIX, 13); the place where the prophet Jonah was born (2 Kings XIA', 25) ; according to Jerome, and to Jewdsh tradition the same with the vidage el-Meshed, an hour N. of Nazareth. There is a tomb shewn' as that of Neby Yunas. (Bibl. Res. Ill, 209; Rabbi Schwartz p. 90.) Gaulanitis, a province of the kingdom of Bashan to the E. of Galilee ; consequently in its AVestern part (Joseph. B. J. Ill, 3, 1 ; IV, 1,1). The site of its capital Golan, a city of refuge of Manasseh (Deut. V, 43; Josh. XX, 8; XXI, 27 ; 1 Chr. AT, 56), is now unknown; but the name ofthe district has continued under the form of Jaulan , between Mount Hermon and the Yarmuk. See also Porter II, 254-259. Gaza , Southern border-city of Palestine, in the country of the Philis- tines (Gen. X, 19; Josh. XV, 47; Judg. I, 18; III, 3; XVI, 1 etc. ; 1 Sam. VI, 17 ; 2 Kings XVIII, 8). Prophecies against Gaza (Jer. XLVII, 1 ; Amos 1/6, 7 : Zeph. II, 4; Zach. IX, 5). For historical notices see Winer, art. Gaza; Bibl. Res. II, 372 sq. Ritter XVI, 45 sq. In Arabic the town is now called Ghiizzeh. Geba, or Gaba, a city of Benjamin (Josh. XATII, 24; 1 Sam. XIII, 3 ; 2 Kings XXIII, S) ; distinct from Gibeah , though near it (Isa. X, 29). Is sometimes interchanged in the authorized trans- lation with Gibeah (Judg. XX, 1 0, 33 ; 1 Sam. XIII, 1 6 ; XIV, 5) ; and even in the original (I Sam. XIV, 16). Levitical city (Josh. XXI, 17; 1 Chr. VI, 60). Jonathan's heroic feat between Geba and Michmash (1 Sam. XIV) ; fortified by Asa with the materials"], [325, "313 of Ramah (1 Kings XV, 22 ; 2 Chr. XVI, 6) ; inhabited after the exile (Neh. VII, 30). Identified by Robinson with Jeba' or Jiba about 30 N.E. of Ramah. (Bibl. Res. II, 113 sq. Bibl. Sac. 1844 p. 598 sq.) See also Stanley p. 493. Geba, a town of Samaria, mentioned in Judg. Ill, 10. Between Bei- san and Geba (therefore S. of Mount Gilboah) Holofernes drew up his camp. Probably the same with Jeba, a village which has evident traces of antiquity (Wilson II, 84), about 45' S. of Sanur. (Narrat. I, 367; Stewart, p. 421.) Gebal, a country S. of Moab, mentioned in Ps\\ LXXXIII, 7 as united with Ammon, Amalek, etc. against Israel. Now a district still caded Jebal, S. of Kerak. Gebal (Byblos), Phoenician city, 24 R. m. North of Berytus (Pliny V, 17) ; now Jebed. Its inhabitants connected with Tyre (1 Kings V, IS; Ezek. XXVII, 9). The Land of the Giblites referred to in Josh. XIII, 5. At Jebeil is an ancient castle constructed with bevelled stones like those of Hippicus (in Jerusalem) and Ba'albek. Wolcott (in Bibl. Sacra 1843 p. 85) observes: \u00abThe in- habitants are spoken of in Scripture as builders.. \u2014 (.this archi- tecture therefore may easily have been adopted from the Jews.\u00bb See also AViner art. Byblos. Gederah, or Gederothaim, city in the plain of Judah (Josh. XV, 36); often held to be the same with Geder, the Canaanitish royal city of Josh. XII, 13; and also with Gederoth of 2 Chr. XXVIII, 18 ; but the order in which Geder is enumerated, seems to imply a situation in the mountains , not in the plain of Judah ; and Ge- deroth, enumerated- with Beth Shemesh, Ajalon, Shocho and Timnah, seems to have been near those places ; whereas we believe Gederah to be identical with Gheterah or Ghederah , a village on the S. banks of W. Surar, near the high road from Ramleh to Ghuzzeh. Gedor , a mountain-city of Judah, mentioned in connection with Hal- hul and Beth-Zur (Josh. XIX, 58); now a site of ruins called Jedur rather more than one hour W. ofthe Jerusalem - Hebron road and less than an hour S. of Beit Zakaria. (Wdson I, 386 ; Lat. Bibl. Res. p. 283.) Gerar, capital of a kingdom in the most Southern part of Philistia (Gen. X, 19; XX, I, 2; XXVI, 1; 2 Chr. XIV, 13); in, or near a large valley (Gen. XXVI, 17); 25 R. m. from Eleuthero- polis (Euseb. \u2014 this distance seems too smad). The Arabic version of Gen. XX, 1, 2 and XXAT, 1 reads el-Khulus instead of Gerar, as if referring to Khiilasah (Reland, p. 755, 805; Bibl. Res. I, 565). J. Rowland in travelling from Gaza to Khiilasah"], [326, "314 came after 3 hours march to the broad, deep Wady Jurf el- Gerar, a little below its junction with a branch-valley from AVady Sheri'ah. Near this junction are ruins called Khurbet el- Gerar G. Williams, Holy City 1845 App. p. 4SS\u2014 492), which he identifies with Gerar. This account we heard confirmed by the people at Gaza, with a slight modification. There are no ruins yet standing, but scattered stones which appear to have been once used in buildings ; and in the absence of ancient weds it would seem as if the ancient city had been supplied by a beautiful spring. That here is an ancient site there can be no doubt about. AVe heard it caded at Gaza, Um el- Gerar and had its locality pointed out to us at the Northern base of the high Tell Jema, which is seen from the hid el-Montar near Gaza. (Narrat. II, 183). Stewart (The tent and the khan p. 207 sq.) claims the ruins el-Abdeh, which Robinson identifies with Eboda of the Tab. Peut. to be the same with Gerar. Near to that site he mentions a AArady Gerar, pronounced Gherar by the Bedawin. Two of the arguments which he brings forward to support his supposition are, however, defective: 1) that Eleutheropolis is \u00abnot satisfactorily)) identified ; 2) that we should have acknowledged in our Narrative the non-existence of ruins at Um el- Gerar. The first we believe is a point long settled beyond dispute. The second is an erroneous inference from a hasty reading and a quotation of part of a sentence, leaving unnoticed the other part. Gerasa, city of Decapods, often mentioned by Josephus (B. J. I, 4, 8 ; II, 18, 1; III, 3, 3; IV, 9, 1; Ant. XIII, 15. 5); now Jerash, large and beautiful ruins, described by Burckhardt (Trav. in Syr. p. 252 \u2014 264). See also Seetzen, I, 388 sq. Gergasa, see Gadara. Gerizim, the mountain on which the blessing was to be pronounced upon the people (Deut. XI, 29; XXVII, 12; Josh. VIII, 33). Situated near Shechem ; the place whence Jotham spoke his parable to the inhabitants of Shechem (Judg. IX, 7). The Sa- maritans built a temple on the summit of Mount Gerizim in the days of Alexander Maced. , which was destroyed by John Hyr- canus. Reference to this temple (John IV, 20). Now caded Jebel et-Tur. (See Ritter XVI, 641 sq.) Geroda, a place mentioned in the Antonine Tables, possibly the modern Jerud, a large village on the great caravan -road from Damascus to Palmyra (Porter I, 371.) Gezer, Canaanitish city, adotted to but not possessed by Ephraim (Josh. XVI, 10; Judg. I, 21); assigned to the Levites (Josh. XXI, 21) ; destroyed by Pharaoh and rebuilt by Solomon (1 Kings IX, 15-17); Gazer in 2 Sam. V, 25, and Gob in 2 Sam. XXI, 18,"], [327, "315 19; the paradel passage of the latter in 1 Chr. XX, 4 reads Gezer; 4 R. m. to the N. of Nicopods (Onom.). A^an Senden holds it identical with el-Kubab, to the N.AV. of 'Amwas at about the distance which Eusebius mentions. Whether the royal city Gezer of Josh. X, 33 and XII, 12 is the same, seems to us doubtful; 1) because its king is said to have come up to assist Lachis (Um-Lakhis), whereas the latter is situated lower than the former ; 2) because el-Kubab is at a great distance from Um- Lakhis, which renders it unlikely, that the king of Gezer would come to oppose Joshua at Lachis, after ado wing him to take the much nearer cities of Makkeda and Libna ; 3) because in Josh. XII, 12 Gezer is enumerated along with Eglon and seems not to refer to a place so far N. as el-Kubab. This second Gezer may possibly be the same with Y&sur, a vidage nearer to the coast towards Ashdod. The Onom. mentions it as Aser between Askelon and Azotus (Halma, art. Aaser). Gibeah, in Mount Ephraim, where Eleasar was buried (Josh. XXIV, 33, where it is rendered \u00abthe hdb.) ; may be identical either with the vdlage Jibea , AVest of the entrance of the Wady of 'Ain Haramiyeh, or with Khurbet Jibia, 1% hour N.W. of Jifna. The Onom. mentions a Geba 5 R.m. North of Gophna, on the way to Neapolis. Jibea lies on that way, but only at 3 R. m. from Gophna (Jifna) ; Khurbet Jibia agrees better in distance, but less in di- rection. Joseph, cads the place Gabatha (Ant. V, 1, 29). Gibeah of Benjamin (Judg. XIX, 12, 14 etc.; comp. Josh. XVIII, 28) ; destroyed by the tribes of Israel (Judg. XX) ; referred to in Hos IX, 9 and X, 9; Saul's residence (1 Sam. X, 26; XI, 4; XV, 34; XXII, 6; XXIII, 19; XXVI, 1); here seven ofthe sons of Saul's house hanged by the Gibeonites (2 Sam. XXI, 6-9). In 2 Sam. VI, 3, 4 Gibeah should be rendered, as in 1 Sam. ATI, 1 \u00abthe hdl\u00bb (Stanley p. 493). Gibeah was 20 or 30 stadia from Jerusalem (Jos. B. J. V, 2, 1). Identified by Robinson (Bibl. Res. II, 114 and Bibl. Sac. 1844 p. 598 sq.) with Tuleil el-Ful, about 1 % hour N. of Jerusalem. Comp. art. Geba. Gibeah, a city of Judah, in the mountains (Josh. XV, 57) ; now Jeba' a village on the high brow S. of AArady Musur, about midway between Jerusalem and Eleutheropolis ; its position agrees with the distance of 12 R. m. from the latter place, as given in the Onom., where it is called Gabaatha. Gibeon, a royal city of the Hevites , whose inhabitants deceived Joshua and thereby saved their lives and cities (Josh. IX, 1 7 ; X, 2 ; XI, 19) ; attacked by five kings, but delivered by Joshua (Josh! X, 1-15); Levitical city of Benjamin (Josh. XVIII, 25; XXI, 17). Geba, Gibeah and Gibeon sometimes confounded"], [328, "316 (1 Chr. XIV, 16; comp. 2 Sam. V, 25). Here the tabernacle (1 Chr. XVI, 39; XXI, 29; 2 Chr. I, 3); here Solomon offered sacrifices and prayed (1 Kings III, 4-15; 2 Chr. 1, 3-13); here Abner and Asahel kided (2 Sam. II, 12-32) ; here Amasa killed by Joab (2 Sam. XX, 8-12). The waters of Gibeon (Jer. XLI, 1 2), probably the large fountain at el-Jib, the village representing Gibeon. (Bibl. Res. II, 137, 138). The situation agrees with Josephus' statement: 50 stadia from Jerusalem on the way to Beth-horon. Gihon, a hdly plot of ground near Jerusalem (1 Kings I, 33, 38); with a fountain (2 Chr. XXXII, 3, 30); on the W. of Jerusa- lem (2 Chr. XXXIII, 14). See AViner, art. Gihon; and Later Bibl. Res. 242. Gilboa (mount) , a mountain -range between Jizreel, Scythopolis and Jenin; 6 R. m. from Scythopolis (Euseb.); where Saul and Jo- nathan were slain (1 Sam. XXVIII, 4; XXXI, 1 ; 2 Sam. I, 6, 21). Eusebius mentions a vidage of the same name, which is stdl existing on the Southern brow of the mountain as Jelbon. As Jebel Jelbon, or by the name of Jebel Fuku'a, from Fuku'a, the highest vdlage of the mountain, this range is known among the natives. See AVdson's remark on Robinson's erroneous criticisms of Richardson with reference to the name of Jebel Jelbun (Lands ofthe Bible II, 88). Gilead , mountains or mountain-country on the E . side of the Jordan (Gen. XXXI, 21, 23; Deut. Ill, 12, 13 etc.); a term generally used for the whole mountain-country from Heshbon to the Hie- romax. The ancient name is now only applied to the district of which es-Salt is the capital ( Jebel- Jil'ad), and which includes the highest mountains on the E. side of the Jordan. See for the different ways, in which the name Gilead occurs in Scripture Winer art. Gilead. Gilgal ; here Joshua encamped after the capture of Ai ; probably be- cause of its position in the centre of the land (Josh. IX, 6 ; X, 6, 7, 15). The expression ..ascended from Gdgab. and owent up from Gilgal all night\u00bb remains quite correct in reference to Gilgal, now Jiljdia, an hour AVest of Sinjil on the Jerusalem - Shechem road, which is lower than the high situated Gibeon (el- Jib), al- though itself also in a high position. This Gilgal is referred to in Elijah's journey (2 Kings II, I) and possibly also in Deut. XI, 30; Hos. IV, 15; IX, 15; XII, 12; Amos IV, 4, etc. (Winer, art. Gilgal; Ked, Comm. on Joshua p. 219, 232.) Gilgal, Canaanitish royal city (Josh. XII, 23) ; probably now Jiljiliyeh near Kefr Saba in the plain of Sharon (AViner, art. Gilyal)."], [329, "317 Gilgal , first place of Joshua's camp after Israel had crossed the Jor- dan (Josh. IV, 1 9, 20), and where the first passover was kept in Canaan (Josh. V, 1 -9) ; but different from Gilgal near Shiloh, where Joshua was subsequently encamped. Visited by Samuel in his annual circuit (1 Sam. VII, 16); Elisha's miracle at Gilgal (2 Kings IV, 38). Was 50 stadia from the Jordan, 10 from Jericho (Jos. Ant. Ar, 1, 4, 11), which would bring it a little S.E. of the present er-Riha. It has totally disappeared. (Bibl. Res. II. 287; Tobler, Top. II, 662.) Gimzo, a town ofthe Israelites taken by thePhdistines(2 Chr. XXATII, 1 8) ; now the village Jimzu, an hour to the E.S.E. of Ludd on the road to Jerusalem (Carmoly, p. 245). Gish, Giscala, Gush-Chaleb, a town fortified by Josephus (B. J. II. 20, 6; see also B. J. IV, 2, 1-5; Vita \u00a7 10 etc.; Reland p. 812; Benjamin of Tudela); now el-Jish, a vidage about 2 hours N.W. of Safed. Gitta, a town of Samaria, mentioned by Justin Martyr, Eusebius, and other ancient writers ; the reputed birth-place of Simon Magus ; now the village Kuriyet Jit, rather more than 2 hours AV. of Nabulus (Bibl. Res. Ill, 144). Gophna, a strong place often mentioned by Josephus (Ant. XIAr, 11, 2; 12, 2; B. J. I, 11, 2; III, 3, 5 ; IV, 9, 9 ; V, 2, 1 ; VI, 2, 2, 3); also byPtolem. IV, 16 (Reland, Pal. p. 461, 816); 15R. m. from Jerusalem on the way to Neapolis (Onom.); 16 R. m. (Peut. Tables) ; identified by Robinson and E. Smith with the present village Jifna, rather more than an hour N.W. of Beitin. Robinson suggests that it may also be identical with Ophni of Benjamin, Josh. XVIII, 24 (Bibl. Res. Ill, 79 ; see also AA^ilson, II. -II). Hadad-rimmon, see Megiddo. Hadid, city inhabited by the Benjamites (Neh. XI, 34); near Lod and Ono (Ezra II, 33; Neh. VII, 37); probably the same which is caded Adida (I Mace. XII, 38; XIII, 12; Jos. Ant. XIII, 15, 2; B. J. IV, 9, 1) ; and identical wdth el-Haditheh, a vidage at the foot of the hills E. of Ludd (van Senden II, 40; Rabbi Schwartz p. 134). Halhul, mountain-city of Judah (Josh. XV, 58) ; now the village Hal- hul with a mosk or wely called Naby Yiinas, on the way from Hebron to Jerusalem, about 1 % hour from the former (Bibl. Res. I, 319; Lat, Bibl. Res. p. 281, 282); a place of Jewish pil- grimage, and considered as the burying-place of Gad the Seer. (Carmoly, p. 242; AVilson I, 384.)"], [330, "318 Hali, a city of Asher (Josh. XIX, 25); perhaps the site of this city may be recognized in that of 'Alia, a place where the rock-hewn foundations of a large city are seen, on the S.E. side ofthe village of M'alia, rather more than 5 hours to the N. E. of 'Akka. The ted of M'alia would seem to have formed the Acropolis of the ancient city. Hamath (The entering in of), the Northern boundary of Israel (Num. XIII, 21 ; XXXIV, 8; Josh. XIII, 5; Judg. Ill, 3; 1 Kings VIII, 65; 2 Kings XIV, 25; 2 Chron. VII, 8). In these dif- ferent scriptures the South and North hne is constantly referred to, not the East and AVest line. In 2 Kings XXAT, 2 1 Riblah is mentioned as in othe land of Hamath... Just at this point the two Lebanon -ranges terminate, opening upon the wide plain which belonged to Hamath. We, therefore, think that the \u00aben- trance\u00bb thus formed by nature itself is referred to by the expres- sion centering in. of Hamath\u00bb (Narrat. II, 470; Stanley p. 403). Porter (Five years etc. II, 355), and Robinson (Lat. Bibl. Res. p. 568) assign that name to the Western approach to Hamath. Hammath, city of Naphtali (Josh. XIX, 35); according to the Talmud the same with the warm baths a little S. of Tiberias, (Hammam) also mentioned by Pliny and Josephus. The identification is un- certain, but has some grounds in its favour (Bibl. Res. Ill p. 260 ; Ked, comm. on Josh. p. 439; AVilson II, 151, 152). There are ruins to the South-side of the Baths (Stewart p. 441). Hammon, city of Asher (Josh. XIX, 28); seems to be identical with the vidage of Hamul, at the upperpart of W. Hamul, between Ras el-Abiad and Ras en-Nakura, as has been suggested by E. G. Schultz. (Ritter XVI, 778 ; see also Lat. Bibl. Res. p. 66.) Hazor, Canaanitish royal city, destroyed by Joshua (Josh. XI, 1-11) ; situated above the lake Saniochonitis (Jos. Ant. V, 5, 1). Porter (Five years etc. I, 304) mentions a site cadedHazur bythe natives, on the Southern slope of a hid which juts out from Merj Ayun towards the Huleh plain ; he remained about a mile's distance from the place and could not make out whether the loose stones, which he saw, were ruins or not. From his description it is evi- dent that he refers to Ted Haye , near to which we passed our- selves and noticed also the stones which have the appearance of ruins. Seetzen holds them to be ruins, and heard them called Kasr Antar. The site would agree with Josephus' statement, and with the Scriptural narrative. De Saulcy speaks of cyclopean ruins which he identifies with Hazor, more to the N. E. of Tell Haye (Dead Sea II, 470 sq.) Whether this is the same Hazor, which is mentioned in Judg. IV, 2, whose king is called Jabin, as was also the king of the earlier"], [331, "319 Hazor, is doubtful ; the complete destruction of the first would lead to the founding of the second Canaanitish Hazor in a different locality. To this second Hazor the ruins of Hazur in the centre of the Gentile-Galdee (about 2 hours AV. of Bint Jebeil) seem to correspond ; and judging from the manner in which En-hazor of Naphtali (Josh. XIX, 37) is enumerated, we would look for that city to the AV. of Kedesh, and consequently also in the position of Hazur. AVe believe, therefore, Hazor of Judg. IAr, 2 and En hazor of Josh. XIX, 37 to be identical. Another Hazor of Naphtali is mentioned in Josh. XIX, 36 along with Ramah, and seems to be identical with TellHazur S.E. of Rameh. Hazur, to theE. of Kul'at Banias, although evidently an ancient site (Thrupp, M. S. notes), is too far to the E. to have any connection with one of the Hazors here mentioned. (Ritter XV, 206, 247, 260). Robinson supposes the different Hazors to be identical with Ted-Khureibeh S. of Kades (Lat. B. R. p\\ 365 ; see also Bibl. Sacra I 847 p. 403). Hazor, a city of Benjamin, inhabited after the captivity (Neh. XI, 33). Robinson (Bibl. Res. Ill, 79) proposes to identify it with Ted 'Asur, about 30'N.AAT. ofthe village Deir Jerir. It seems indeed likely, that this tell represents an ancient Hazor; but not that of Benjamin, as lying to the N. of its Northern boundaries (comp. Josh. XATII, 12). Tobler, Top. II, 400, with apparently better grounds, supposes it the same with Khurbet Arsur (or Asur), a ruin near Bir Nebala and near to Ramah , Anatoth and other cities in the context (Neh. XI). Hebron, or Kirjath Arba Gen. XIII, 2; Josh. XIV, 15; XV, 13; XXI, 11 ; Judg. I, 10; Neh. XI, 25); now el-Khulil or Khalil \"the friendn, after Abraham, the friend of God. City of Judah in the mountains (Josh. XIX, 54). Built seven years before Zoan in Egypt (Num. XIII, 22). Situated in or on the sides of a valley (Gen. XXXVII, 1 4). A tradition, first found in the 1 2\"' century (in IBenjamin of Tudela) and since extensively copied, places ancient Hebron onTell-Bedun, to theN. of the present town (Bibl. Res. II, p. 458; Bibl. Sac. 1843 p. 60). The natives at Hebron told us (1852), that anciently the city stood nearly an hour more to the W., at a site now called Nunkur. The origin of such traditions may perhaps be found in the numerous ruins scattered over the hills around the present town, and probably once forming its extensive suburbs (Narr. II, 68). Abraham dwells inMamre near Hebron (Gen. XIII, 18; XIV, 13, 24; XVIII, 1). Here Mach- pelah, the sepulchral cavern bought by Abraham , where Sarah was buried (Gen. XXIII), and afterwards also Abraham (Gen. XXV, 9, 10), and Isaac, Jacob, Rebecca and Lea (Gen. XLIX, 29-32; L, 12, 13)* The spies of Israel come to Hebron (Num. XIII, 22)'; a Canaanitish royal city (Josh. XII, 10): conquered"], [332, "320 by Joshua (Josh. X); given to Caleb (Josh. XIAr, 6 \u2014 15; XV, 13; Judg. I, 20), who cut off the Anakims (Josh. XI, 21, 22; XV, 14). Hebron, a city of refuge (Josh. XX, 7); a Levitical city (Josh. XXI, 11); the royal residence of David (2 Sam. II, 1-4, 1 1 ; 1 Kings II, 1 1 . Here Abner mrfrdered by Joab (2 Sam. Ill, 27), and Ishbosheth's murderers hanged; his head here buried (2 Sam. IAr, 12). David here anointed king over Israel (2 Sam. V, 3; 1 Chr. Ill, 1-4; XII, 1-3; XIII, 23, 28). Fortified by Rehoboam (I Chr. XI, 10) ; rebuilt after the captivity (Neh. XI, 25) ; taken by Judas Mace. (1 Mace. V, 65) ; burnt by Cerealis (Joseph. Bed. Jud. IV, 9, 7, 9). A bishop's see under tbe Cru saders ; in 1 1 87 taken by Saladin. (v. Raumer p. 182, 183 ; Wil son, I, p. 355 sq. ; Ritter XVI, 209 sq.) Helbon, a place famous for its wine (Ezek. XXATI, 1 8 ; now Helbon, a village with ancient ruins N. of Damascus, in AArady Helbon (Rabbi Schwartz, p. 484 ; Porter, Five years etc. I, 331 \u2014 333). Heldua, the first station mentioned in the Itin. Hieros. South of Berytus, and N. of Porphyreon ; now probably Khan el-Khulda (Bibl. Res. Ill, 435). Heleph, city of Naphtali (Josh. XIX, 33) ; apparently on its AVestern borders; perhaps the same with Beitlif, a vdlage with ancient remains on the Southern brow of AVady el-' Ayun , just where it bends its course from S.W. to N.W. The upperpart ofthe wady towards Surrebin formed perhaps part of the boundary between Asher and Naphtali. Heliopolis of Strabo, Pliny, Josephus, Ptolemy (Later Bibl. Res. p. 518); has been universally recognized as the present Ba'albek. The latter has also been identified with Baal-gad of Josh. XI, 17; XII, 7 (see Caesarea -Philippi); but Robinson justly ob- serves, that it lies too far North to be called oat the foot of Her- mon... Nor does there seem any argument in favour of the sup- position, that Ba'albek is Baal-hamon of Cant. VIII, 1 1 (Wilson II, p. 384; Russegger, Reise etc. I, 700). Helkath, Levitical city of Asher, near the N. Eastern boundary of that tribe (Josh. XIX, 25 ; XXI, 31 ) ; would seem to correspond both in name and position with Ukkrith or Ikkrith, a vdlage with ancient remains on the high land between AV. el -'Ayun and AAr. el-Kiirn. Hepha, or Kepha of the Talmud, Sycaminos of the Onom. and Itin. Hieros. (Jos. Ant. XIII, 12, 3) ; now Haifa or Khaifa (Reland, p. 699, 819). The ruins of Sycaminos are , however, 1 '/\u201e mde more to the N.AV., than the present town. Haifa is sometimes identified with Calamon, which the Itin. Hieros. places 3 R. m. further than Sycaminos towards 'Akka (AArilson II, 24 1). This"], [333, "321 seems an error of the Itin. Hieros., for there are no ruins to the N.E. of Haifa. We believe Calamon identical with Tell es- Semakh, a smad tell with ruins on the S.AV. side ofthe pro montory of Carmel (see Reland, p. 415, 678). Hermon, dofty peak.., a mountain, the majesty of which is referred to in Scripture ; called also Sirion and Shenir .(glittering breast- plate.) in adusion to its snowy brow (Deut. Ill, 8, 9) ; and Sion \u00abthe upraised.. (Deut. IV, 48); Baal-Hermon (Judg. Ill, 3; 1 Chr. V, 23) evidently from it being the chief seat of idol- worship of the land, as the many ruined temples on the slopes, in the ravines and on the lofty summit of the mountain indicate (Porter, Five years &c. I, 295). Zion in Ps. CXXXIII, 3 seems to stand forbore, evidently referring toHermon's central high dome with its surrounding lower peaks (Stanley, p. 400; Narrat. I, 126, 127). Hermon, a boundary of Israel's land (Josh. XI, 3, 17 ; XII, 1 ; XIII, 5 etc.) ; referred to also in Ps. LXXXIX, 12 ; Cant. IV, 8-; now Jebel esh-Shekh ; also Jebel eth-Thelj \u00abthe snowy mountain... Hermon (Little), the traditional appellation of Jebel Duhy in the plain of Esdraelon, probably dating from the commencement of the fourth century, and originating in a wrong interpretation of Ps. LXXXIX, 12 (where Hermon is mentioned with Tabor), and from a misconstruction of Ps. XLII , 7 (Bibl. Res. Ill, 171, 172). Herodium, see Beth-haccerem. Heshbon, royal city in Moab (Num. XXI, 26; Deut. II, 24) ; to Reu- ben (Josh. XIII, 27; comp. Num. XXXII, 37); to Gad (Josh. XXI, 39; 1 Chr. VI, 81), and as such assigned to the Levites ; under Moab (Isa. XV, 4 ; Jer. XLVIII, 2) ; 20 R. m. from the Jordan (Onom.) ; episc. city in the times of the first Christians; now a ruin called Hesban, visited by Seetzen, Burckhardt, Buckingham and others. Hieromax or Hieromiax (river); (Pliny H. N. V, 16); Jarmoch of the Talmud ; now Nahr Yarmuk (Edrisi and Abulfeda) , or Sheri'at el-Mandhiir (Ritter XV, 372). The principal sources are near Mezarib, where they form a lake of half an hour in cir- cumference . Hinnom (Valley of the son of), the wady running along the South and South West side of Jerusalem; boundary-mark between Ju- dah and Benjamin (Josh. XV , 8 ; XVIII, 16); here was To- pheth (2 Kings XXIII, 10); referred to also in Neh. XI, 30 and Jer. XIX, 2. 91 van de Velde, Holy Land."], [334, "322 Hippos, city 30 stadia from Tiberias (Jos. vita \u00a7 65) ; one of the De- capods (Reland, Pal. p. 215); frequently mentioned by Josephus (Ant. XV, 7, 3; XVII, 11, 4; B. J. II, 18, 1; ib. 18, 5; III, 3, 1 ; also vita \u00a7 31); episcopal city (Reland, p. 440, 821); identified by Burckhardt with the ruin es-Sumrah , at the S.E. side of Lake Tiberias. It has also been supposed identical with the ruin Kul'at el-Husn , W. of Fik (Apheca) ; but this position does not answer the requirements of Josephus' description (Ritter XV, 352, 353). Horem, city of Naphtali (Josh. XIX, 33); possibly the same with Hurah, a low tell with ruins, at the entrance of AV. el-' Ain (Northern extremity of the little plain of Rumash) . Hosa, border-city of Asher (Josh. XIX, 29); perhaps the same with el-Kauzah , vdlage with traces of antiquity near AV. el-'Ain. If this is correct , it lies on the very place where the borders of Naphtali commence at Heleph (Beit lif). See also Elkosh. Hukkok, city of Naphtali (Josh. XIX. 34); probably the same with the village Yakuk, between AVady Kefr 'Anan and AV. Selameh (Rabbi Schwartz, p. 182; Lat. B. R. p. 81 ; Carmoly, p. 131, 154, 185, 209, 385). Idalah, a town of Zebulon (Josh. XIX, 15); may possibly be the same with Jeda or Jeida , a vidage an hour S. of Beit-lahm (Beth- lehem of Zebulon), in connection with which it is mentioned. Robinson (Lat. B. R. p. 113) cads it \u00aba miserable vdlage, with no traces of antiquity.) ; but the Rev. Dr. Kalley , who spent here 24 hours (March 1S52), informed me by letter, that altho' its marks of antiquity are much obliterated, he stid saw sarcophagi and a pidar , as wed as old bottle-shaped cisterns. The houses being outside plastered over with mud, the ancient stones used in their construction are only visible inside. People told him that they were brought from a ruin on the S. side of the vdlage, called el-Keneiseh \u00abthe church... Ijon, city of Naphtali (1 Kings XV, 20; 2 Chr. XAT, 4); now a large ruin -covered tell on the N.E. side of Merj Ayun, now called Tell-Dibbin after the neighbouring vdlage Dibbin. Irnahash, a city of Judah (1 Chr. IV, 12); probably Deir Nakhaz, a village with ancient remains, E. of Beit-Jibrin. Iron, city of Naphtali (Josh. XIX, 38); now Yariin, a village of Be- lad Besharah. On the N.E. side of the place are the foundations and other remains of the ancient city. Ir-Shemesh, city of Dan, on the frontiers of Judah (Josh. XIX, 41), probably the same which is caded Beth-Shemesh in Josh Xv' 10 (Bibl. Res. Ill, 19). See Beth-Shemesh."], [335, "323 Iscariot, see Sychar. Ituraea, a province in the tetrarchy of Philip (Luke III, I); probably received its name from Jetur (Gen. XXV, 15, 16); inhabited by the half-tribe of Manasseh, at the foot of mount Hermon ( I Chr. V, 19\u201423) ; now the district of Jediir, occupying the plain at the S. Eastern base of Hermon (Porter II, 272 \u2014 275). Jabbok (river), (Gen. XXXII, 22) ; between Gerasa and Philadelphia (Onom.) ; boundary of the Ammonites (Josh. XII, 2 ; Judg. XI, 13; Num. XXI, 24); now AVady Zerka ; described by Seetzen and Burckhardt. Jabesh or Jabesh-Gilead (Judg. XXI, 8, 10; 1 Sam. XI, 1, 3), where the body of Saul was burned (1 Sam. XXXI, 1 2 ; 2 Sam. II, 4 ; XXI, 12); 6 R. m. from Pella towards Gerasa (Onom.); pro- bably the ruin ed-Deir, on the Southern brow of AV. Yabis (Lat. B. R. p. 319). Josephus refers to it (Ant. A\", 2, 11 ; VI, 14, 8). Jabneel, border-city of Judah (Josh. XV, 11); its walls broken down by Uzziah after he took it from the Philistines (Jabneh 2 Chr. XXVI, 6) ; Jamnia in 1 Mace. IV, 1 5 ; V, 58 ; X, 69 ; XV, 40 ; 2 Mace. XII, 9; and in Joseph. Ant. XII, 7, 4 ; 8, 6 ; XIII, 4, 3 ; B. J. I, 7, 7; IV, 8, 1. Situated between Diospolis and Asdod (Onom.). Episc. city in the days of Arius. The Crusaders had near Jabneh a castle, Ibelin or Hibelin. Now Yebna, a town 3 hours S.W. of Ramleh (Ritter XVI, 125; v. Raumer. p. 184'. Jabruda, a city mentioned by Ptolemy (Geogr. V, 15); and as an episcopal city by S. Paulo (Geogr. Sac. p. 294) ; now Yabrud, a village, but still the seat of a bishop ; rather more than an hour to the W. of the great caravan-road from Damascus to Homs, nearly midway between these two cities (Porter, Five years &c. I, 360). Jaezer or Jazer, city of Gilead (Num. XXXII, I ; 2 Sam. XXIV, 5 ; 1 Chr. XXAT, 31); given to the Levites (Josh. XXI, 39); later under Moab (Isa. XVI, 8; Jer. XLVIII, 32); 10 R. m. from Philadelphia, and 15 from Heshbon (Onom.); now probably Seir, a site with ruins visited by Seetzen and also by Burckhardt, in the locality where the Onom. places it (see also AViner, art. Jaeser.) Janohah, border-city between Ephraim and Manasseh (Josh. XAT, '6, 7) ; 1 2 R. m. to the East of Neapolis (Onom.) ; evidently the present village of Yanun, with ancient ruins (Narrat. II, 303, 304) , about 3% hours S.E. of Nabiilus. Euseb. and Jer. con- found it with Janoah, which was taken by Tiglath-Pdeser, along with other cities of Naphtali (2 Kings XV, 29). The latter is enumerated between Abel- Beth- Maachah and Kedesh; and as 21*"], [336, "324 between these two places there are no ruins of any fortified town, except those of Kid' at Hunin, it would seem that Hunin and Janoah are identical. Although the names differ much , yet there is sufficient affinity to justify also by etymological inference tbe supposed identity. A ruin called Yanuh, on a hill S.W. of Haddata (Lat. B. R. p. 58)., seems by its name to have more correspondence with Janoah , than has Hunin ; but it lies in the centre of the Gentde Galilee , and Tiglath Pdeser's march seems rather to have fodowed the brow of the hills along the Hiileh plain. Japhia, town of Zebulon (Josh. XIX, 12); now Yafa, a little S. of Nazareth (Josephus, B. J. II, 20, 6; III, 7, 31 ; Bibl. Res. Ill, 200; Wilson II, 91 ; v. Schubert III, 203). Japho, Joppe , sea-port on the boundaries of Dan (Josh. XIX, 46; 2 Chr. II, 16; Ezra III, 7 ; Jonah I, 3 ; 1 Mace. X, 75 ; XIV, 5, 34; comp. Joseph. Ant.

Jarmuth, Canaanitish royal city (Josh. X, 3 \u2014 27; XII, 11) ; assigned to Judah ; in the plain (Josh. XV, 35) ; inhabited after the exile (Neh. XI, 29) ; 10 R. m. from Eleutheropolis towards Jerusa- lem (Onom. ; this distance is too great) ; now the vdlage Yarmuth, about 40' W.N.W. from Beit Netif (Bibl. Res. II, 344) ; a tell rises above it, which we heard caded 'Ermud or 'Armuth, evi- dently a different pronunciation of the same name (Yarmuth) (Narrat. II, 193). Jarmuth in Issachar, see Ramoth. Jattir, Levitical city in the mountains of Judah (Josh. XV, 48 ; XXI, 14; 1 Sam. XXX, 27; 1 Chr. VI, 57); identified by Robinson with 'Attir, about midway between Hebron and Beer-Sheba (Bibl. Res. II, 195). Jedna, a town mentioned by Eusebius, 6 R. m. on the way from Eleu- theropolis to Hebron ; now the village Idna , in the position as indicated. Jehud, city of Dan, in the plain (Josh. XIX, 45); supposed by Ro- binson (Bibl. Res. Ill, 45) and by Rabbi Schwartz (Geogr. Descr. of Pal., p. 141) to be the same with el-Yehudiyeh , a village"], [337, "325 nearly 3 hours E. of Yafa. There seems to be no ground to doubt the identity. Jenysus, city mentioned by Herodotus (Herod. Ill, 5; Reland, p. 43 and Ritter XVI, 40) ; has been identified by traveders with Khan Yiinas, S.W. of Gaza on the coast-route to Egypt (Narrative of a Mission to the Jews by the Scotch Missionaries 1839, p. 96, 97). Ritter, in fodowing F. Hitzig's Urgeschichte der Phdister, doubts the identity and inclines to hold el-Arish to be the same with Jenysus. Jericho, \u00abthe city of palm-trees\u00bb (Deut. XXXIV, 3; Judg. I, 16; III, 13; comp. 2 Chr. XXVIII, 15); in the plain or vadey of the Jordan (Josh. IV, 13; 2 Kings XXV, 5 &c.) ; over against the plain of Moab and the heights of Nebo (Num. XXXV, 1 &c. * Deut. XXXIV, 1 ; Josh. XIII, 32) ; 60 stadia from the Jordan (Jos. Ant. V, 1, 4) ; Canaanitish royal city (Josh. XII, 9) ; con- quered by Joshua (Josh. II and VI). Curse pronounced against him who should rebuild it (Josh. VI, 26; 1 Kings XVI , 34). Assigned to Benjamin (Josh. XVIII, 21); conquered by Eglon, King of Moab (Judg. Ill, 13). Here a school for the sons of prophets (2 Kings II, 1 \u2014 5); a fountain healed by Elisha (ib. v. 19 \u2014 22); inhabited after the captivity (Ezra II , 34; Neh. VII, 36); fortified by Bachides (I Mace. IX, 50); visited by the Saviour; Bar-Timeus healed (Matth. XX, 29, 30; Marc X, 46 -52; Luke XVIII, 35\u201443; XIX, 1\u201410). Embellished by Herod; who dies here (Jos. Ant. XVII, 6 \u2014 8; B. J. I, 33, 6). Destroyed during the siege of Jerusalem; rebuilt by Hadrian. Now generally identified with the village er-Riha , where how- ever no traces of antiquity are to be found. The ruins of ancient Jericho seem to be those near 'Ain es-Sultan (the Elisha's foun- tain) , half an hour AV. of er-Riha (Bibl. Res. II, p. 279\u2014286, 297 sq.). Jerusalem, \u00abthe vision of peace\u00bb (Stanley, p. 175) ; now el-Kuds .(the holy one\u00bb.

The geographical position of Jerusalem has been given in a previous chapter. Jezreel, city of Issachar (Josh. XIX, 18) ; Ahab's residence (1 Kings XVIII, 45, 46 ; XXI, 1) ; here Joram and Jezebel killed by Jehu (2 Kings VIII, 29; IX, 15 \u2014 37; see also X, 1 -11 ; comp. Hos. I 4 11 ; II, 22); now Zer'in, at the foot of the Gilboa mountains in the plain of Jezreel or Esdraelon (Bibl. Res. Ill, 163 \u2014 167; Wilson II, 86: Narrat. II, 370, 371; v. Raumer, p. 140; Winer, art. Jisreel). Jezreel (the plain of) , or Esdraelon in Greek ; the battle-scene of"], [338, "326 Barak and Sisera (Judg. IV ; V) ; of Saul and the Phdistines (1 Sam.

II, p. 440 sq.) The plain is now called Merj Ibn Amir. In a limited sense the name of Plain of Jezreel refers, of course, only to the portion over against Zer'in, between Jebel Duhy and Jebel Fuku'a (see also Stanley, p. 331 sq.). Jiphthah - el (the valley of) , formed part of the boundary between Asher and Zebulon (Josh. XIX, 14, 27). As it is mentioned in connection with Zebulon \u2014 the city, identical with Abdin \u2014 we believe it to be the present AVady Abdin, which has its beginning near Jefat , a site of ruins (see Jotapatd) visited by E. G. Schultz, and also by Robinson and Smith in 1852. Ro- binson holds W. Abilin to be identical with the valley of Jiph- thah-el, because of the affinity of the latter name with Jefat (Lat. Bibl. Res. p. 107; Ritter XVI, 768). Jokneam , Canaanitish royal city, at the foot of Carmel ; Levitical city of Zebulon (Josh. XII, 22; XIX, 11; XXI, 34); Kaymon in Judith VII, 3 ; now a tell with ruins, called el-Kaimun ; Cam- mona or Cimana of the Onom. , 6 R. m. North of Legio on the way to Ptolemais (this distance is too smad). See Narr. I, 331 ; also Lat, B. R. p. 115. The Onom. confounds Cammona with Camon of Judg. X, 5, which was probably in Gdead.

XIX, 28) ; now the vdlage of Kana, nearly 3 hours S.E. of Tyre (Robinson, Bibl. Res. Ill, 384). Kanah (the brook), boundary between Ephraim and Manasseh (Josh. XVI, 8; XVII, 9). There is a AVady Kanah which has its commencement near Akrabeh as W. Makhfuriyeh, and which runs to the plain of Sharon and to the Nahr el-'Aujeh as AV. Za- kiir. This valley Robinson holds to be \"without doubt\u00bb identical with the Scriptural brook Kanah ; but nevertheless we have our \u00abdoubts\u00bb , as A\\rady Kanah seems to be much too far South for having ever formed the boundary between Ephraim and Manas- seh. More likely seems Rabbi Schwartz's suggestion (p. 50, 51): that the brook which rises at 'Ain el-Kazab , a mile W. of Na- bulus, which lower down flows through AVady Sha'ir to the plain and finady as Nahr Falaik to the sea , is the same with Kanah \u00abthe reedy.\u00bb This name is perpetuated in that of 'Ain el-Kazab \u00abspring of reedso, and justified in the fact of the extensive reedy marshes near the mouth of the stream. Karem , or Caraem , one of the eleven cities interpolated by the LXX between Josh. XV, 59 and 60; now the vidage 'Ain Karim, about 1 % hour AV. of Jerusalem (Tobler, Top. II, 344 sq. ; Lat. B. R. p.272; AVilson II, 268). Kartah, Levitical city of Zebulon, mentioned along with Jokneam (Josh. XXI, 34) ; possibly the same with el-Harti, a village with traces of antiquity on the banks of the Kishon , on the borders of Zebulon and Asher. Kedesh, Levitical city, and city of refuge in Naphtali (Josh. XIX, 37; XX, 7; XXI, 32; Judg. IV, 6); formerly Canaanitish royal city'(Josh. XII, 22; see also 2 Kings XV, 29) ; now the village of Kades, on the hdls N.W. of the Huleh lake, with fine orna- mented sarcophagi and other remains of antiquity (Narr. II, 417, 418 ; Lat. B. R. p. 367\u2014369). Kedron or Cedron, the brook on the E. side of Jerusalem iJohn XVIII, L; probably \u00abthe brook\u00bb of Neh. II, 15; now AA^ady Kedron. between Jerusalem and the mount of Olives. Is called AV. er-Rahib lower down between Bethlehem and Deir Mar Saba ; W. en-Nar in its lowest part , and sometimes also in a general way. The brook, at present, runs only during heavy and"], [340, "328 continued rains in winter. Tradition has identified the Kedron valley with the valley of Jehoshaphat of Joel III, 2. Keilah, city in the plain of Judah (Josh. XV, 44; 1 Sam. XXIII, 1 &c. ; Neh. Ill, 17, IS) ; 17 R. m. to the E. of Eleutheropolis towards Hebron (Euseb.) ; 8 R. m. (Jerome) ; the latter distance is correct: a ruin in that situation bears stdl the name of Kila, as we were informed by the people at Hebron. Robinson in 1838 passed below the site and mentions it as \u00aba ruined tower\u00bb (Bibl. Res. II, 427), but does not give its name. Kefr Chananiah, a town in Galdee, mentioned in the Talmudical writings (Rabbi Schwartz, p. 187; Carmoly, Itin. p. 154, 204), now the village Kefr 'Anan, on the side of AArady Kefr 'Anan, S.AAT. of Safed. Has ruins of a synagogue. Kenath, city of Gdead, caded Nobah after Nobah its conqueror (Num. XXXII, 42; Judg. VIII, 1 1 ; 1 Chr. II, 23) ; Canath and Ca- natha of the Ononi. , Ptolemy, Josephus and Pliny; now Ku- nawat, at the base of Jebel Ha'uran, as was proved from an in- scription found by Seetzen. Its ruins are described by Burck- hardt, Buckingham (Ritter XV, 932 sq.), but more completely by Porter (II, 90\u2014110). Keriathaim, city of Moab (Jer. XLVIII, 1, 23; Ezek. XXV, 9); be- longing to Reuben (Gen. XFV, 5; Num. XXXII, 7 ; Josh. XIII, 19) ; probably now the ruin Kureiyat, visited by Seetzen (Reise II, 342) on the S.W. slopes of Jebel Attarus. Kerioth, city of Judah (Josh. XV, 25); perhaps identical with the present Kereitein, a site of ruins on the hid-slopes on the W. side of the valley, which descends Southward from Main towards the desert. Kerioth, a city of Moab (Jer. XLVIII, 23, 24, 41 ; Amos II, 2); identified with Kureiyeh, N.E. of Busrah. on the Southern spurs of Jebel Ha'uran. The reason for which we hesitate to accept of the identity of Bozrah of Moab and Beth-yamul with Busrah and Um el-Jemal, makes us also doubt that of Kerioth with Ku- reiyeh. See the articles Bozrah and Beth-gamul. (Five years &c. II, 191 sq.). Keziz (valley of) , belonging to the portion of Benjamin (Josh. XATII, 21). A wady bearing the same name, AVady el-Kaziz, is still found a little to the East of the fountain of the Apostles on the way from Jerusalem to Jericho. Kirjath-jearim, (.city of forests-. (Stanley p. 520), also called Baalah and Kirjath-baal ocity ofthe sanctuary.. (Josh. XV, 9, 60); frontier-city of Judah and Benjamin (Josh. XVIII, 14, Judg XATII, 12); formerly city of the Gibeonites (Josh. IX, 17); 9"], [341, "329 R. m. from Jerusalem towards Diospolis (Onom.) ; thither the ark of the covenant was brought from Beth-shemesh (1 Sam. VI, 2 1 : VII, 1, 2) ; and removed thence to Jerusalem (2 Sam. VI, 2, 3; 1 Chr. XIV, 5, 6) ; birth-place of the prophet Urijah (Jer. XXVI, 20) ; inhabited after the exile (Ezrall, 25 ; Neh. VII, 29). Iden tified by Robinson with Kuriet el -Enab, vidage nearly in the place where the Onom. fixes it. (Bibl. Res. II, 334-336). The way by which the ark was brought up from Beth - Shemesh was sought for by Robinson and Smith in 1852, but not ascertained; they suppose it was by Saris (Lat. B. R. p. 157.) Kir -Moab, fortified capital of Moab (Isa. XAr , 1); seems the same with Kir-Haraseth and Kir-Haresh of Isa. XVI, 7, 1 1 and- Jer. XLVIII, 31; Characmoba of Ptolemy; Karaka (2 Mace. XII, 17); since the middle ages Karak or Kerak; also Petra deserti ; now Kerak. Visited by Seetzen in 1806 and by Burckhardt in 1812. The castle of Kerak , of which the imposing ruins have remained tid now, was budt by Paganus, a Frank nobleman, in 1183. \u2014 The present inhabitants are very fanatical against European traveders. AVith the Christian part of the population these find, however, a hospitable welcome. Kishon (othe river that is before Jokneam*.) Josh. XIX, 1 1 ; here Si- sera's host was swept away (Judg. IV, 7 ; V, 21 ; Ps. LXXXIII, 9) ; here the priests of Baal were slain (1 Kings XVIII, 40) ; \u00abthe waters of Megiddo*. (Judg. Ar, 19); now Nahr Mukata ..river of slaughter... (Stanley p. 351 ; see also on the name Mukata AVd- son II, 86.) Kulon, see Coulon. Lachish, Canaanitish royal city (Josh. XII, 15) ; taken by Joshua after the capture of Libnah and before that of Eglon (ib. X, 29, 30) ; Levitical city (ib. XXI, 13; 1 Chr. VI, 57). Independent of Judah (2 Kings VIII, 22; 2 Chr. XXI, 10). Besieged by Senna- cherib (2 Kings XIX, 8; Isa. XXXVII, 8). Erroneously placed in the Onom. 7 R. m. South of Eleutheropolis ; now a site, called Um-Lakhis, about midway between Gaza and Beit-Jibrin, show- ing a few ancient building-stones scattered over a low mound. (See Narrat. II, 188; v. Raumer p. 166, 167, 190). The iden- tity is doubted by Robinson (Bibl. Res. II, 388) ; but not on any reasonable grounds. (Ked, Comm. on Joshua p. 246.) Laish, Lesem, see Dan. Lebanon and Antilebanon. The Map gives the required geographical de- tails and is further supplied by descriptions of scenery , vdlages, streams, and by routes and altitudes in the preceding chapters. The Scriptures refer often to both ranges under the one common name of Lebanon (Deut. I, 7; XI, 24; Josh. I, 4; XI, 17:"], [342, "330 XIII, 15; Judg. Ill, 3; 1 Kings V, 6; IX, 19; 2 Kings XIV, 9; XIX, 23; 2 Chr. VIII, 6 ; Ezra III, 7 ; Ps. XXIX, 5 ; XCII, 13; CIV, 16; Cant. IV, 8; Isa. II, 13; X, 34; XXIX, 17; XXXIII, 9 ; XXXV, 2 ; Jer. XXII, 20 ; Ezek. XXVII, 5 ; Hos. XIV, 7; Zach. XI, 1.) Lebanon (the valley of), see Bikath-Aven Lebonah, a town near Shiloh (Judg. XXI, 19) ; now the village of Lubban, about one hour W. by N. of Seilun, on the high-road to Nabulus. It is situated on the brow of the hids, AV. of the road. Lehi (Judg. XV, 9, 14), see Ramoth of the South. Leontes (river), held by Robinson (Bibl. Res. Ill, 409, 410) to be identical with the present river Litany, the sources of which are some 3000' high up in the Buka'a, at 'Anjar and near Ba'albek, and which in its lowest course bears the name of Nahr el- Kasimiyeh, from ((division.) as forming a boundary-line between the adjacent districts. He thinks the word Litany a corruption fromLanteh, a name by which Edrisi mentions the river in the 12\"' century and which seems the corrupt form of Leontes. At the same time he quotes Ptolemy, who places the Leontes between Berytus and Sidon ; and Strabo, who mentions the city Leontopolis between the Tamyras and Sidon , which would imply the identity of the Nahr el-Auwly with the Leontes. Ritter (XVII, 48, 49) demon- strates that the Kasimiyeh is not the Leontes ; he holds the name Litany to be original and that' of Leontes a corruption. (See also Stanley p. 402). In the absence of other decisive arguments, and thinking it impossible , that so important a river as the Litany should not be especially mentioned by the ancient geographers, we have continued the name of Leontes, which seems now to be, rightly or wrongly, universally adopted. Libnah, Canaanitish royal city (Josh. XII, 15) ; conquered by Joshua. on his march from Makkedah to Lachis (ib. X, 29, 31) ; city of Judah in the plain (ib. XV, 42) ; given to the Levites, and city of refuge (ib. XXI, 13, 1 Chr. VI, 57). Independent of Judah (2 Kings VIII, 22; 2 Chr. XX, 10); besieged by Sennacherib (2 Kings XIX, 8 ; Isa. XXXVII, 8). It is also mentioned 2 Kings XXIII, 31 ; XXIV, IS. In the region of Eleutheropolis (Onom.). The only site in the plain between Sumed (Makkedah) and Um- Lakhis (Lachis) \u2014 where undoubtedly Libnah was situated \u2014 showing an ancient fortified position , is the tell of 'Arak el- Menshiyeh, about 2 hours AV. of Beit-Jibrin. The tell lies on the N. side of the vidage. The position answers in every respect to the requirements of Scripture. I was also informed, when taking a bearing of the tell from Ted es-Safiyeh, that there are ancient ruins. I believe it therefore to be identical with Libnah."], [343, "331 Livias, see Beth-haran. Lod (1 Chr. VIII, 12) ; city inhabited by the Benjamites after the exde (Ezra II, 33 ; Neh. XI, 35) ; Lydda of the N. Test. (Acts IX, 32, 38) near Joppe; Diospolis of the Romans (Reland, p. 877) ; now Ludd, a little country-town surrounded with splendid gardens and orchards, near Ramleh. It is often referred to by Josephus (Ant. XX, 6, 2 ; B. J. II, 19, 1 ; III, 3, 5 ; IV, 8, I) ; Bibl. Res. Ill, 49-55; Narrat. I, 444, 445. Luz, the former name of Beth'- el; (Gen. XXVIII, 19; XXXV, 6; XLVIII, 3; Josh. XATII, 13; Judg. I, 23). A second Luz was founded by the man who was spared with his family by the con- quering children of Benjamin (Judg. I, 24-26). This may be Luza mentioned by Eusebius, 3 R. m. from Sichem (Stanley p. 231, 232), the ruins of which are stdl found on Mount Ge- rizim, bearing the ancient name of Lvisa (Seetzen, Reise I, 174 ; AVilson II, 69) ; they are about 1 0 minutes beyond the trench of the sacrifice of the Samaritans when coming from Nabulus. Lybon or Libo, city mentioned in the Itin. Antonini , as being situated XXXII R. m. from Ba'albek (Heliopolis) and also XXXII from Laudicia. For its name there has elsewhere in the same Itin. been substituted that of Conna. The distances do not agree with those of the present village of Lebweh, but the name seems to leave no doubt as to the identity. Robinson's suggestion of the manner in which the distances of the Tables in the Itin. Ant. have got corrupted may be correct (Later Bibl. Res. p. 533). The identification was given by Thomson in Bibl. Sacra 1848 p. 699. See also Ritter XVII,T69 and Porter, Five years etc, II, 322, 323. Lycus (the river) , of ancient geographers is universady recognized as the present Nahr el-Kelb, at the mouth of which, about 2% hours N.E. of Beirut, are found the remarkable rock-tablets with inscriptions of different foreign monarchs who left here a memorial of their victorious steps. (Amongst other authors see AVilson II, 405 sq. and Later Bibl. Res. p. 619 sq.)- fflachaerus, a strong fortress on the Southern banks of the N. Zerka Main ; budt by Alexander Jannaeus on a high and almost un- accessible rock; 60 stadia from the Dead Sea (Joseph. Bed. Jud. VII 6,1); destroyedby Gabinius; rebuiltby Herod, who constructed also' a city at its base (ib. Ill, 3 ; IV, 7, 5) ; frontier-city of Herod Antipas, tetrarch of Galdee, who here imprisoned John the Baptist, and had him beheaded (ib. Ant. XVIII, 5; Matth. XIV, 10). Machaerus was later taken by Lucdius Bassus (Bed. Jud. IV, 7, 6). Discovered by Seetzen (Jan. 1806); extensive ruins on a rocky spur jutting out from Jebel Attarus towards the N. and"], [344, "332 overhanging the Wady of the Zerka Ma'in. The ruins are called Makaur or Mkaur. Seetzen (Reise II, 330-331 ; also Ritter XV, 569, 577, 578.) Madon, Canaanitish royal city (Josh. XI, 1 ; XII, 19) ; Rabbi Schwartz (p. 90) holds it identical with the present Kefr -Menda, a large vdlage at the Western end of the plain of el-Biittauf. Robinson found here sarcophagi and other traces of antiquity ; he regards Kefr Menda as '(doubtless ancient., and as having been \u00bba strong place\u00bb, although he connects it not with Madon, but with Asochis of Josephus (Vita \u00a7 41). (Lat. B. R. p. 109, 111). See also Carmoly, p. 255, 383, 455. Magludorum , an episcopal city of the Eastern section of Antilebanon mentioned in the Greek Notitia Eccles. Robinson supposes it to be the same with the present M'aliila, a vidage famous for its convent and ruined churches. (Lat. Bibl. Res. p. 537; Porter, Five years etc. I, 351 sq.) Magoras (river), mentioned by Pliny H.N. V, 20 (comp. Pococke, II 91) ; probably the present Nahr Beirut. (Bibl. Res. Ill, 439.) Majuma, a little town at the sea-side, 7 stadia from Gaza and con- sidered as its port (Strabo XAT, 759; Ritter XVI, 59-62). It is now represented by the little vdlage en-Nesleh. (Narrat. II, 186.) Makkedah. In the cavern of M \u2014 the five defeated Canaanitish kings took refuge ; royal city taken by Joshua (Josh. X, 10-28, 29; XII, 16). City of Judah in the plain (ib. XV, 41). Erroneously placed in the Onom. SR.m. East of Eleutheropolis, as there are no caverns in that portion of the country, which, besides, cannot be called othe plain. \u00bb It is probably identical with Sumed, a vd- lage, on a hillock, and having ancient remains, in the plain, about 2% hours N.W. of Beit-Jibrin. (Bibl. Res. II, 368). Ro- binson seems not to have noticed the cavern which I was assured that existed at Sumeil, and which with those of Beit-Jibrin, Deir Dubban and Dhikkrin, it was added, were the only large caverns ofthe plain (Narrat. II, 173.) Maon, city of Judah, in the mountains (Josh. XV, 55; 1 Sam. XXV, 2); now Tell Ma'in, 2% or 3 hours S. of Hebron. (Bibl. Res. II, 194.) Mardocho, the name of a vidage mentioned in a Greek inscription which Burckhardt found on the ruins of a convent at the vdlage Deir el-Leban. It is now called Murduk. Another vidage, Rimeh, is mentioned along with Mardocho in this inscription. Rimeh bears yet its ancient name. The three places are near one another, N.AV. of Kenawat at the foot of the Ha'uran mountains. (Porter II. 83.)"], [345, "333 Mareshah, city of Judah, in the plain (Josh. XV, 44; Mic I 15- 2 Mace. XII, 35) ; fortified by Rehoboam (2 Chr. XI, 8; comp! XIV, 9, 10); situated 2 R. m. from Eleutheropolis' (Euseb.): now a site of ruins at 1% mile S. of Beit-Jibrin (Bibl. Res. II, 422). AVe heard the people at Beit-Jibrin cad the place Merash. Masada, strong fortress on a high cliff near the Dead Sea; budt by Jonathan Maccabaeus ; fortified by Herod (Jos. B. J. VII, 8, 2 sq. ; Ant, XIV, 13, 9) ; captured by Flavius Sdva; now called Sebbeh. Extensive ruins. (Narr. II, 97-103). The rock on which the fortress was built may possibly have been, as its name implies, the stronghold whither. David fled (1 Sam. XXIII, 14, 29 and perhaps also 2 Sam. Ar. 17). Stanley, p. 527 ; Stewart p. 338. Maximianopolis, now el-Lejjun. See Megiddo. Mearah, a stronghold of the Sidonians in the high cliff E. of Sidon (Josh. XIII, 4). Ritter identifies it (XVII, 100; also XAT, 8 and 9) with Mughara, a once strongly fortified cavern, high up in the rocks between Jezzin and Mishmushy ; the same which the Crusaders caded Cavea de Tyron, and which afterwards was the last retreat of the Emir Fakhr ed-Din. The place is now also known as Shukif Tairun (Abulfeda). Schultz is the first tra- veder who mentions it in modern days. Medaba, frontier-city of Reuben (Josh. XIII, 9, 16); conquered from the Amorites (Num. XXI, 30; 1 Chr. XIX, 7); but later under Moab (Isa. XV, 2; 1 Mace. IX, 36) ; now a ruin about 1% hour S.E. of Hesban; visited by Seetzen and by Burckhardt. Megiddo, Canaanitish royal city (Josh. XII, 21); assigned to Ma- nasseh in Issachar's inheritance (Josh. XVII, 11); but not con- quered (Judg. I, 27) ; Baana placed by Solomon over If \u2014 (1 Kings IV, 12); budt or fortified by Solomon (1 Kings IX, 15); here Ahaziah killed (2 Kings IX, 27); near it Josiah killed in battle against Pharaoh-Nechoh (2 Kings XXIII, 29, 30; 2 Chr. XXXA\\ 20, 25; comp. Zech. XII, 11); identified by Robinson with el- Lejjun, the ruins of Legio of the Onom. (Bibl. Res. Ill, 177- 180. and Lat. Bibl. Res. p. 118). The fortified town Megiddo was probably situated on the large Ted-Metzedim, 1 5 or 20 N.W. of the ruined khan on the S. side of the stream. May its name othe Ted of the Governor\" have yet reference to Baana, Solo- mon's governor? Aron Raumer (3'1 ed. p. 402) has, we believe justly, identified el-Lejjun also with Maximianopolis, which the Itin. Hieros. places at 20 R. m. from Caesarea and 10 from Jezreel. Jerome identifies Maximianopolis with Hadad- riinmon , evidently the present Rummaneh at the foot of the Megiddo-hills, in a notch or vadey about 1% hour S. of Tell"], [346, "334 Metzedim. The distances, however, of Rummaneh do not agree with the Itin. Hieros. and we believe Jerome's identification to be one of his numerous mistakes. For a description of the ruins el-Lejjun see Narr. I, 353. Merom (the waters of) , a lake near which Joshua defeated the five united Canaanitish Kings (Josh. XI, 5, 7) ; its name signifies \u00abThe high lake\u00bb , as it is the uppermost of the lakes througli which the Jordan passes (Reland, p. 262). Samochonitis of Josephus (B. J. Ill, 10, 7); now Bahr el-Huleh, probably from Ulatha (Greek), a name given to the district in which the lake is situated, between Trachonitis and Galdee (Jos. Ant. XV, 10, 3; B. J. I, 20, 4). Stanley (p. 387) heard that it is now also called Bahr Hit (sea of wheat). Meroth, orMero, a town mentioned by Josephus (B. J. II, 20, 6; Vita \u00a7 37) and probably the same with Meiron ofthe Talmud, mentioned in connection with Gush-Halab, or Giscala (el-Jish) ; now the vidage Meiron, about 1% hour W.N.AV. of Safed; famous for Jewish pilgrimages to the tombs of their ancient rab- bis (Wdsonll, 311; Carmoly, Itin. p. 133, 260; Bibl. Res. Ill, 334; Lat. Bibl. Res. p. 73, 74). Meroz, a town which was accursed because the inhabitants thereof came not to the help of the battle of Barak against Sisera (Judg. V, 23). Wdson identifies it with either Kefr Musr, South of M' Tabor, orMariissus, 1 '/\u00bb hourN. of Beisan. To the latter supposition adheres also Rabbi Schwartz (Descr. Geogr. of Pal. p. 168) ; but Wilson (II, p. 89, 107) rightly inclines more to the identity with Kefr Musr, on account of its nearness to Barak's camp on Tabor. Michmash or Michmas, city of Benjamin (Ezra II, 27 ; Neh. VII, 31; XI, 31); E. of Beth-aven (1 Sam. XIII, 5); near Geba (Isa. X, 28); 9 R. m. from Jerusalem, near Ramah (Onom.); now Mukhmas , a ruined vidage about 2'/2 hours N. E. of Jerusalem (Bibl. Res. II, 113, 117). Migdal-el, city of Naphtali (Josh. XIX, 38); is sometimes identified with el-Mejdel on the Lake of Tiberias ; probably the same with Magdala (Matth. XV, 39), the traditionary birth-place of Mary Magdalene (Bibl. Res. Ill, 278, 279; Narrat. II, 394). For \u00abthe coasts of Magdala.. Mark (VIII, 10) has \u00abDalmanutha\u00bb. This latter name may be recognized in the \u00abCave of Teliman\u00bb of the Talmud (Rabbi Schwartz p. 189), probably one of the caves in the cliffs above Mejdel. Migdal-gad, city of Judah in the plain (Josh. XV, 37) ; possibly iden- tical with the present el-Mejdel near Askulan, although it would seem, at the first glance, as if Migdal-gad had been nearer to the mountains."], [347, "335 MlSheal a city of Asher (Josh. XIX, 26), given up to the Gershonites (XXI, 30 and 1 Chr. VI, 74 dlfas/iah) ; situated according to the Onomast at the sea-side near Carmel, where its ruins are still found, called Misalli. The name and position of Misalli about an hour N. of 'Am Haud, was given to us by the natives of that village . Misrephoth-maim. Here Joshua's army pursued the defeated Ca- naamtes after the battle near the waters of Merom (Josh. XI, 8). Identified by E. G. Schultz and Thomson (Bibl. Sac. 1855', p. 822 sq.) with a collection of springs caded 'Ain-Mesherfi, at the foot of Jebel Miishakka, near Ras en-Nakura. Ruins of the same name i.Mesherfi) are near the fountains. Mizpeh, city of Judah in the plain (Josh. XAr, 38). Possibly the pre- sent Ted es-Safiyeh, between Beit-Jibrin and Ekron, which has also been identified with the castle of Blanche garde or Specula Alba, budt by King Fulco of Jerusalem (Bibl. Res. II, 366). Mizpeh, a city of Benjamin (Josh. XATII, 26), near Ramah and Geba (1 Kings XV, 22; 2 Chr. XVI, 6) ; where the tribes assembled; Samuel offered* sacrifice and judged the people; Saul was chosen King; the residence of Gedaliah (Judg. XX, 1 ; XXI, 1 ; 1 Sam. VII, 5 \u2014 16; X, 17 &c. ; 2 Kings XXAT . 22 \u2014 25; Jer. XL ; XLI) ; identified by Robinson with Naby Samwil N.W. of Je- rusalem (Bibl. Res. II, 143, 144; also AVilson II, 37). Stewart (p. 353) holds it to be also the same with othe great high place in Gibeono (1 Kings III, 4). Stanley considers Naby Samwil to be the amountain of Gibeon*. , but identifies Mizpeh with the sweding ground N. of Jerusalem , the ancient Scopus (Sinai and Pal. p. 213, 214; comp. 211, 224). Moladah, city of Judah (Southern part) (Josh. XV, 26); assigned to Simeon (Josh. XIX, 2 ; 1 Chr. lAr, 28) ; stdl inhabited after the captivity (Neh. XI, 26). Four R. m. from Arad on the Hebron- Ada road (Onom.). Identified by Robinson and Smith with Tell Milh. nearly 2 hours S.AV. from Ted 'Arad. The Onom. men- tions alsoMelathaon the side of Ether, a city belonging to Simeon in the Daroma 20 R. m. South of Eleutheropolis ; apparently the same Melatha which is mentioned by Joseph. Ant. XVIII, 6, 2. This Melatha would seem according to these statements not to be the same with el-Milh or Moladah ; but perhaps with Tell- Melaha , an ancient site on the banks of W. Sheri'ah , 2 or 3 hours AV.N.AAr. of Tcd-Hora. (See Ether.) Nahallal, city of Zebulon (Josh. XIX, 15; Judg. I, 30); we agree with Rabbi Schwartz's proposition (p. 172) to identify this city with the ancient remains at Mai id."], [348, "336 Nain, a town of Galilee (Luke VII , 11); S. of Mount Tabor; near Endor (Onom.); now a poor village still called Nein , at the N. Western base of Jebel Duhy (Bibl. Res. Ill, 226). Nazareth, a town of Galilee (Matth. II, 23 ; IV, 13 ; XXI, 1 1 ; Luke I, 26; II, 4; IV, 16, 29); now en-Nasirah , the chief place of a district of the same name. Neapolis, an ecclesiastical city of Arabia (S. Paulo, Geogr. Sac. p. 296; Not. Eccl. p. 50; Reland, Pal. p. 217); identified from an inscription by Porter (II, 85) with the modern Suleim , a vd- lage 1% hour W.N.W. of Kenawat in Jebel Ha'uran. There are extensive ruins. Neballat, city inhabited by the children of Benjamin after the exile (Neh. XI, 34) ; probably the same with Beit-Nebala, near Ludd (Bibl. Res. Ill, 30). Nebo , mountain in Moab , over against Jericho , and forming part of the mountains generally caded Abarim (Deut. XXXII, 49, 50); its summit designed as Pisgah (ib. XXXIV, 1) ; here Mozes died (ib. verse 5); 6 R. m. West of Heshbon (Euseb.). The name seems now to have disappeared ; yet there can be little doubt about the situation of the heights of Nebo between Hesban and the Dead Sea. Burckhardt thinks Nebo to be the same with Jebel Attarus (Travels p. 370). Nephtoah (the waters of), boundary- mark of Benjamin and Judah (Josh. XV, 9). Probably the fountain of Lifta, at about 35' W. by N. from Jerusalem, in the valley which runs S. of the village (Stewart, p. 349, 350). Netopha or Beth Netopha, a town mentioned in the Talmud (Mishna Shebirth IX, 5), at the side of a large vadey; evidently the same with the modern vdlage Beit-Netif ; but Netopha of Ezra II, 22 and Neh. ATI, 26 seems to have been to the N. of Bethlehem. Neve, city ofthe Itiner. Anton. , 36 R. m. from Capitolias (Reland, Pal. p. 217, 909, 910) ; probably the present Nawa, a con- siderable vidage on the road from Damascus to Beth-Shean (Rit- ter XV, 356, 823 sq.). Nezib, city in the plain of Judah (Josh. XV, 43); 7 R. m. from Eleutheropolis (Jerome) ; the same with Beit Niisib , at the foot of the Judea-mountains, just where Jerome places it (Bibl. Res II, 404; III, 12, 13). Nimrim , seems to have been a city of Moab , famous for its stream (Isa. XV, 6; Jer. XLVIII, 34); possibly now the ruin en- Nmeirah, at the mouth of a wady of that name at the S.E. end of the Dead Sea. Euseb. and Jerome say that in their days"], [349, "337 there was a place called Benamerium to the N. (ought to be S.) of Zoar Halma, art. Xemrin'i. Nob, city of Benjamin, inhabited after the captivity (Neh. XI, 32); between Jerusalem and Anatoth (Isa. X, 30, 32); famous for Doeg's treacherous conduct towards David, and Saul's cruelty towards Abimelech and his house (1 Sam. XXI, 1\u20149; Matth. XII, 3; Luke VI, 3; 1 Sam. XXII, 18, 19). Here the Phi- listines defeated (2 Sam. XXI, 16 \u2014 18). Identified by v. Raumer (p. 195, 196) with the vdlage el-Isawiyeh. about 55r from Jeru- salem on the way to 'Anata. Nobah, see Kenath. Nobe, a town mentioned by Jerome and sometimes also called Beth- annaba; probably the present Beit Nuba at the entrance of Wady Soleiman (Lat. B. R. p. 145). Nonum (Mutatio ad) , a Roman station on the coast between Tyre and Sarepta (Itin. Hieros. ed. Parthey p. 275); probably now 'Adlun, a site of ruins , half an hour AVest of a vdlage of that same name, situated on the hdls near the coast (Ritter XVII, 71. 361, 362; Bibl. Res. Ill, 411 ; Isambert in Budet. de la Soc. de Geogr., Paris 1853 N. XXXIV). Half a mile S. of the ruins 'Adlun is a remarkable extensive necropolis ; the entrances of the rock hewn sepulchral chambers face the coast towards the South. 'Adlun is not Ornithonpolis, which see. Olives (Mount of), a sabbath -journey from Jerusalem (Acts 1 , 12); 5 or 6 stadia (Jos. Ant. XX, 8, 6 ; B. J. V, 2, 3) ; on the E. side of Jerusalem (Ezek. XI, 23; Zach. XIV, 4); where the Messiah's feet shall stand. In its olive-gardens the Lord Jesus often retired with His disciples (Matth. XXI, 1; XXIV, 3; Marc. XI, 1; XIII, 3; Luke XXI, 37; John VIII, 1 ; XVIII, 1). At its S. Eastern base near Bethany the scene of the Ascension (Luke XXIV, 50 and Acts I, 12). Now Jebel et-Tur, with a village of that name and traditionary church of the Ascension on its highest summit. Ono, city budt by the Benjamites near Lod (1 Chron. VIII, 12; Neh. XI, 35); probably now the vidage Kefr 'Anna 1 % hour N. of Ludd; it has traces of antiquity. That it was situated in the plain (Bik'ah), is mentioned in Neh. VI, 2. Ophni, see Gophna. Ophrah or Ofrah, city where Gideon dwelt (Judg. AT, 11 , 15, 24; VIII, 27, 32; IX, 9) ; in Manasseh (Judg. AT, 15). The history of Gideon and his sons shows that Ophrah was not very far from Shechem. Possibly it may have been at a site some 20' S.S.E. of the present village Akrabeh, on the opposite side of 22 van dc Velde, Holy Land."], [350, "338 the vadey, near the AVely Abu Kharib. This site is called Erfai and shews traces of an ancient place (Narr. II, 304). Ophrah, city of Benjamin (Josh. XATII, 23; 1 Sam. XIII, 17); 5 R. m. East of Bethel; identified by Robinson (Bibl. Res. II, 124: and Bibl. Sac. 1845 vol. II) with the village et-Taiyibeh, about 1% hour N.E. of Beitin. That this Ophrah is distinct from the city of Gideon in Manasseh , has been justly observed by Keil (Comm. on Josh. p. 418); as also by v. Raumer. art. Ophra in Samaria and Judea. It is probably the same with Ephron of 2 Chr. XIII, 19 (Bell. Jud. IAr, 9, 9), and Ephraim of John XI, 54. Omithonpolis , a smad city between Tyre and Sidon (Strabo; Bibl. Res. Ill, 411), a little to the N. of Sarepta (Scylax ; Ritter XVII, 45) ; probably now Tell el-Burak, a small tell marking the site of a former place, on the coast just where Scylax points it out. There is no other ancient site between Sidon and Sarepta. Perhaps the name Omithonpolis \u00abcity of birds.* was derived from the many birds which naturally would here collect, as the tell is shut in between two fine streams, and of old as wed as now this abundance of water must have caused the spot to be covered with the richest vegetation. That such wed watered and wooded places form the great resort of birds is, amongst others, seen in the valley of Shechem. Orontes (the river), now N. el-'Asy \u00abthe rebedious\u00bb ; described by Strabo, Pliny, Abulfeda &c. (Lat. Bibl. Res. p. 539). For its fountains in the AVady Fikeh , at the caverns called Deir Mar Maron, see Itinerary 9 and 1 0 June ; for the fountain at Lebweh see Bibl. Sacra 1847 p. 40S, and 1848 p. 694 \u2014 700. Thomson, Journey from Aleppo to Mount Lebanon &c. : also Later Bibl. Res. p. 532 and Porter, Five years &c, II, 322, 326 sq. Orthosia, city identified by Thomson with the ruins of a town, which he found on the N. bank of the Nahr el-Barid (see the remark on this position in chapter II, Section I and II of the Map). Paradisus, city of Laodicene, mentioned by Ptolemy, Geogr. V, 14; Strabo XVI. 2, 19; Pliny, Hist. N. AT, 19, 23; identified by Robinson with Jusiyeh el-Kadim , a site with extensive ruins, about 1 % hour S.E. of Riblah, near the Orontes (Lat. Bibl. Res. p. 556). This identification is chiefly founded upon the sup- posed identity of Laodicea Scabiosa with Ted Naby Mindau (on the Orontes, a little beyond the Northern limits of our Map) ; Porter, Five years &c. II, 339. Ritter doubts the identity of the latter (Erdk. XVII, 997\u2014999). Parah, a city of Benjamin (Josh. XVIII, 23); perhaps identical with"], [351, "339 a site of ruins called Farah, near the junction of AV. Farah with W. Tuwar and W. es-Selam. Buckingham speaks of a village called Farah ; this is an error which Robinson noticed (Bibl. Re's. II, 112); but the latter did not notice the ruins of that name. These were visited by Krafft (Ritter XVI. 529). Pella, city belonging to Decapods (Pliny); also called Biitis i Steph. Byzant.) ; inhabited by Macedonian veterans of the army of Alex- ander the Great ; hence called Pella after the Macedonian Pella ; in possession of the Jews during the days of Alexander Jannaeus (Jos Ant. XIII, 15, 4 ; B. J. I, 4, 8) ; taken from them by Pompey (Ant. XFV, 4, 4; B. J. I, 7, 7) ; the city whither the Christians took refuge during the siege of Jerusalem (Euseb.) ; later episcopal city of the Second Palestine (Lat. B. R. p. 324) ; now exten- sive ruins called Fahel or Tubakat Fahel, opposite Beisan, on the E. side of the Jordan. (See Itinerary 14 May; Narr. II, 352 sq. PhaenOS, the capital of Trachonitis ; Aenos of the Tab. Pent. ; one of the episcopal cities of Arabia (S. Paulo, Geogr. Sac. p. 297); 27 R. m. from Damascus, 37 from Kenath ; now the village Musmeih on the Northern edge of the Lejah , as was proved from an inscription (Burckhardt, Trav. p. 117, 118; Porter, Five years &c. II, 112, 113). Phagor, one of the eleven cities interpolated by the LXX in Josh. XV, 59, 60 ; Phogor, near Bethlehem (Onom.) ; now the ruin Beit Faghur, about an hour S. S.AV. of Solomon's pools (Rabbi Schwartz p. 108; also Lat. Bibl. Res. p. 275 and App. p. XXIV). Pharpar, river of Damascus (2 Kings V, 12) ; identified with the mo- dern 'Awaj by Monro ; also by Porter, who visited its sources in the ravines of Mount Hermon and its middle and lower sections in the plain of Damascus. (See Five years &c. I, 299 sq., 312 sq. ; and Bibl. Sac. 1854, p. 344 sq., comp, with p. 62 sq. ; also Thomson in Bibl. Sac. 1849, p. 367, 368.) Phasaelis, city in the plain of the Jordan; thus called by Herod the Great after his brother Phasaelus (Jos. Ant. XAT, 5, 2) ; re- ferred to by Josephus 'Ant. XVII, 8, 1 ; XATII, 3, 2 ; B. J. II. 9, 1); also mentioned by Pliny. H. N. XIII, 9 and Ptolemy V, 16, p. 141 ; now Tell Fasail, a small tell with ruins at its base. ' The site is inhabited by a few people who cultivate their gardens. These are irrigated by a brook, the fountain of which is an hour more to the West , hidden as it were under the high cliffs below Daumeh and under the shade of a dense jungle Brocardus and Mar. Sanudo (Seer. Fidel, cruc. Lib. ill. XL\\. cap 3) identify this little stream, now called 'Am lasad, with the brook Cherith (1 Kings XVII, 3-7); see Jos Ant. VIII, 13 7* Reland Pal. p. 953; Bachienc , Hcihge Geogr. I, 1, 22'"], [352, "340 p. 126\u2014130; Narrat. II, 310, 311; de Bertou in Budetin de la Soc. de Geogr. Paris 1839. Sept. and Oct., p. 159 ; Winer. art. Chr ith. Pherathi , a town of upper Galdee , mentioned in the Talmudieal writings ; now the village Ferathi, S.AV. of Safed (Rabbi Schwartz p. IS 7) ; seems to be the same with Pharadia of Jichus Ha-abot (Carmoly, Itin. p. 453). Phiala (Lake) , described by Josephus , and believed by him to supply the fountain at Banias (Bed. Jud. Ill, 1 0, 7) ; the present Birket er-Ram, E. of Banias ; first examined by Irby and Mangles 1818, Travels, p. 287 ; identified by Thomson in Bibl. Sac. vol. Ill, p. 189\u2014 192. See also Ritter XV , 154 sq. , 174\u2014177; WdsonH, 180; Lynch's Offic. Rep. p. 110; Lat. Bibl. Res. p. 399, 400. Seetzen, and also Robinson, heard it called Birket er-Ran (Reise I, 334, 335). Philipopolis, a city budt by Phdippus of Bostra ; afterwards an episco- pal city (S. Paulo, Geogr. Sac. p. 295; Reland, Pal. p. 218); identified, from an inscription in which the name occurs , by Burckhardt with 'Orman, a town E. of Sulkhad Trav. in Syria. p. 99; Ritter XV, 954). Pirathon, city in Mount Ephraim (Judg. XII, 15; 1 Mace. IX, 50; Jos. Ant.' V, 7, 15; XIII, 1,3); now the vidage Fer'ata, about 2'/-, hours AV.S. W. of Nabulus (Reland, Pal. p. 956 ; v. Raumer, p. 142; Dr. Zunz in Benj. of Tudela by Asher II, p. 486; Rabbi Schwartz p. 151 ; Later Bibl. Res. p. 134). Porphyreon, a city mentioned by Scylax between Sidon and Berytus, and accordingto the Itin. Hieros. at 8 R. m. North of Sidon (Re- land, Pal. p. 431; Pococke II, 89 ; Bibl. Res. Ill, 431). Traces of it are found in the vidage el-Jiyeh near Naby Yunas (Later Bibl. Res. p. 35). Pundeka, a village of Dan, mentioned in the Talmud jRabbi Schwartz, p. 144); now the village Funduk , about midway between Na- bulus and the plain of Sharon towards Yafa. It lies on the S. side of the road. Robinson passed near it in 1852 (Later Bibl. Res. p. 135). Rabbath - Ammon , the capital of Ammon (Deut. Ill, 11 ; Josh. XIII, 25); besieged by Joab and taken by David (2 Sam. XI, 1 ; XII, 26; 1 Chr. XX, 1); appears again as belonging to Ammon (Jer. XLIX, 3). Caded Philadelphia by Ptolemaeus Philadelphus (Onom.; AViner II, p. 296); now 'Amman, extensive ruins at the sources of the Nahr Zerka (here N. 'Amman) ; described by Seetzen (Reise I, 397 sq.) and Burckhardt (Travels p. 357 \u2014 360). Rabbath-Moab, see Ar-Moab."], [353, "341 Rabbith or Harabbith, city of Issachar iJosh. XIX, 20). Rabbi Schwartz (p. 166) identifies it with Araboneh , a village on the S.AArestern slopes of Mount Gdboah. Rakkath, city of Naphtali (Josh. XIX, 35); the Jewish Rabbis uni- versally agree in identifying it with the site of the present Tiiba- riyeh (Lightfoot in Ked, Comment, on Joshua p. 439). Ramah, or Ramathaim - zophim , the city where Samuel was born (1 Sam. I, 19, 20) ; of his residence (I Sam. VII, 17 ; VIII, 4 ; XVI, 13 ; XIX, 18) : and where he was buried (I Sam. XXV, 1 ; XXVIII, 3). Here Saul was anointed (1 Sam. IX, 6; X, 1); David fled to Samuel to Ramah (1 Sam. XIX, 18 \u2014 24). AVe have given in our Narrat. II , 48 \u2014 54 at full length the reasons for holding this Ramah identical with Rameh, a place of exten- sive rums about one hour N. of Hebron. AVoleott (Bibl. Sacra 1843, p. 44 sq.) has first proved this identity. The only pas- sage which seems to contradict it, is 1 Sam. I, 1, where Elkanah is called ca man of Ramathaim Zophim, of Mount Ephraim.. ; but 1 Sam. IX and X show by the route which Saul had to go, after leaving Samuel, thatRamah was not in Mount Ephraim, as it lay S. of Rachel's tomb. The meaning would thus be, as Josephus (in the orig. Greek) gives it (.Elkanah , a Levite ... of Mount Ephraim.., having migrated to and now -.dweding in Ramatha\u00bb. The reason of his emigration is even suggested in that same verse, viz., that he was a descendant of \u00abZuph, an Ephrathite.* and would thus naturady feel inclined to return from the moun- tains of Ephraim to those of Ephratha. AVe ought also to quote from a passage in Felix Fabris' journey from Jerusalem to He- bron, Gaza &c. (Sept. 1483, see Ritter XIV, 885, 886), that he came to ca castle S' Samuel , near to which is the castle of Sl Abraham... The latter was the name given in the middle ages to Hebron (v. Raumer p. 181) and Sl Samuel is evidently no other than the present Rameh \u2014 not the large ruins el-Kiil'ah near Um el-'Amad and Simia, mentioned by Seetzen (as Ritter supposesi, for these are S. ofHebron and their position does not agree with the order in which S' Samuel and S' Abraham are men- tioned. The appellation of S1 Samuel proves that in the middle ages the place was considered as Ramah oi Samuel ; and in fact, as Wolcott remarks , not only are here the foundations of an extensive and ancient site, but its name is identical and it meets forcibly all the topographical exigencies of Scripture. Ramah, city of Naphtali (Josh. XIX, 36) ; now Rameh, a high situated vdlage a little to the N. of the high-way from Akka to the Nor- thern end of Lake Tiberias, and about, midway. Visited by E. G. Schultz in 1847 (Ritter XVI, 772); by Robinson and Smith in 1852 (Lat. B. R. p* 79; see also Lynch's Offic. Rep. p. 126)."], [354, "342 Ramah, city of Benjamin (Josh. XVIII, 25); near Geba and Gibeah Judg. XIX, 13 ; 1 Kings XV, 17, 22 ; Hos. V, 8) ; in Mount Ephraim (Judg. IV, 5) ; fortified by Baesa against Judah (1 Kings XV, 17; 2 Chr. XVI, 1 &c. ; comp. Jer. XL, 1); referred to in Isa. X, 29 ; inhabited after tbe exile (Ezra II, 26; Neh. VII, 30; XI, 33); 6 R. m. North of Jerusalem towards Bethel; now the village er-Ram, situated in that very position (Bibl. Res. II, 315\u2014317). Ramah, a city of Asher (Josh. XIX, 29). The Vulgate has Horma. Ro- binson (Lat. Bibl. Res. p. 64) thinks it to be identical with the vil- lage of Ramah, with ancient ruins, about 3 hours S.AV. of Tibnin. No doubt, here is an ancient Ramah represented : but it seems to us too far in the central part of the land, to answer to Josh. XIX, 28, 29. If the strong city of Tyre of verse 29 is intended for the continental Tyre, Ramah seems more probably identical with a vidage of that name about an hour from the present Sur, and which must have been within half an hour's distance from the ancient continental fortress Tyre (Thrupp M. S. notes ; he adds that it is correctly marked in the Benedictine-edition of Jerome). The supposition ventured after Breidenbach, Zwadart (Tres-devot voyage etc.), Anvers 1608 p. 71 , andHalma p. 330, in Narrat. I, 114, that Ramah should be identical either with the village el-Hamrah, or with Arniin near Kul'at esh-Shukif, is erroneous. Ramath of the South , city of Simeon in the Southern portion of Ju- dah's inheritance (Josh. XIX, 8, where it is identified in the Dutch and French versions with Baalath-Be'e'r ; comp. 1 Chr. IV, 33, Baal, and Josh. XV, 24, Bealoth). In Judg. XV, 17 the place where Samson slew a thousand Philistines with a jaw-bone is called Ramath-Lehi ..Ramath of the Jaw-bone.). David sent presents to them which were in South Ramath (1 Sam. XXX, 27). A city Baalath occurs in 1 Kings IX, IS; 2 Chr. VIII , 6 as one of Solomon's fenced astore - cities and chariot- cities\u00bb , evidently referring to such a place as would be situated on the great Egyptian high - way , where provision and con- veyance for the then frequent trafic with Egypt through the de- sert might be procured. vRamath of the South which is Baalath\" has, therefore, to be sought for on the Southern border of Judah. on the Egyptian high-way , and its site must show traces of having been once a strong place. To these requirements Tell cl-Lekiyeh, about 1% hour N. of Bir es-Seba, perfectly answers. It is the last ((height\" or Ramath of Judah, and would be very properly designated as \u00abRamath of the South.) ; tlie present, high - road from Hebron to Egypt passes within 45' distance from Ted el-Lekiyeh and may. therefore, be sup-"], [355, "343 posed anciently to have touched that site. Its name, too, seem. to have preserved the ancient one of Lehi, for which Ramath became famous. The tell shows ruins from the road-side (going from Bir es-Seba to Beit-Jibrin, see Itiner. I April 1852), which circumstances did not permit us to visit. AVhctber the spring, which burst forth in answer to Samson's prayer, and Ain-Hakore of Judg. XV, 19 may be identified with the large fountain between Ted -Hora and Tell-Khe'welfeh , this will be ascertained when future researches prove that there exists no other fountain on the AV. side of Tell-Lekiyeh which has a bet ter claim upon the identity (see further Narrat. II, I 10 \u2014 142). Ramoth, Levitical city of Issachar ( 1 Chr. VI, 73); Remeth in Josh XIX, 21 and Jarmuth in Josh. XXI, 29; probably the same with the present village Rameh, about 3 hours N. of Sebustiyeh, to the left of the way to, Kefr KM (Winer, art. Ramoth and Jar- muth ; Keil, Comm. Josh. p. 428). Ramoth Gilead, or Ramoth Mizpah, Levitical city of refuge (Josh. XXI, 38); in the portion of Gad (Deut. IV, 43; Josh. XIII. 26; XX, 8); here one of Solomon's chief governors (1 Kings IV, 13). Later in the power of the Syrians; Ahab's unfor- tunate siege (I Kings XXII, 3 &c). Again under Israel (2Kings ATII, 29; IX, 1); 15 R. in. West from Philadelphia (Euseb.) who places it, however, erroneously on the banks of the Jabbok There seems to be no reasonable ground for doubling its identity with the present es-Salt. Rehob, a town mentioned in the Onom. 1 R. m. South from Scythopolis ; but confounded with Rehob of Num. XIII, 21, and with Rehob of Josh. XIX, 28 and 30. A smad tell with ruins called Rehab marks the site oi Rehob oi the Onom. S. of Beisan , but which is not mentioned in Scripture. Rehoboth, name of a wed, which Isaac digged (Gen. XXVI, 22); probably identical with a wed on the way from Hebron to Egypt, 7% hours S.S.W. of Bir es-Seba. The Gaza-Petra road passes also by it. Near the well, now fided up with earth and stones, on its N.E. side, is a hid covered with ruins caded Ruheiba (Bibl. Res. I, 289 \u2014 291; Stewart, p. 201 \u2014 203). The expression 'lie went up from thence to Beer-Sheba\u00bb (verse 23) corresponds well with the relative positions of Ruheiba and Bir es-Seba. Rephaim (Plain, or valley of). The undulating plain S. of Jerusalem towards Beit Jala. Boundary of Judah and Benjamin (Josh. XV, 8 \u2022 XVIII 1 6) ; here the Philistines twice defeated by David (\u2022'Sam. A\"', 18 \u2014 25). Three of David's heroes break through the camp of the Phdistines in the valley of R\u2014 , in order to get water from Bethlehem (2 Sam. XXIII, 13, 14)."], [356, "344 Riblah, city on the N.E. border of the Promised Land iNum. XXXIA', 11); here Pharaoh-Nechoh encamped (2 Kings XXIII, 29, 30, 33) ; here Jehoahaz held captive ; here Nebuchadnezzar encamped ; here Zedekiah blinded and fettered, and the nobles of Judah slain (2 Kings XXAr, 6, 7, 18 \u2014 21 ; Jer. XXXIX, 5, 6; LH, 9; io, 24 \u2014 27). Jerome errs in identifying it with Antioch (Onom., art. Reblathah) . Now the vidage Riblah on the E. banks of the Orontes. There are foundations and lower walls of a square tower of large hewn stones, and ein the gardens and fields around are traces of ancient buildings of considerable extent be- neath the rich soil\u00bb (Porter, Five years &c. II, 335). Rimmon, city of Zebulon (1 Chr. AT, 77); Remmon-methoar (Josh. XIX, 13); probably identical with Rummaneh, village at the S.A\\restern part of the plain of el-Buttauf, 1 i/i hour N.E. from Sefurieh (Bibl. Res. Ill, 195). Rimmon, city of Simeon in the Southern part of Judah (Josh. XV, 32: XIX, 7 ; 1 Chr. IAr, 32) ; perhaps the same mentioned in Zech. XIV, 10; 16 R. m. South of Eleutheropolis (Euseb.); now a ruin, Um er-Rummamin, on the way from Beit-Jibrin to Bir es- Seba, very nearly at the distance mentioned by Eusebius. Keil (Comm. Josh. -p. 377, 378) quotes a remark of Movers, that Ain, which is mentioned with Rimmon in the original text with- out the copulative junction, probably means Ain -Rimmon, one city, or as it is called in Neh. XI, 29 Enrimmon. He hesitates , however , and we believe justly , in pronouncing the passages of Josh. XIX, 7 and I Chr. IV, 32 as corrupt. Gro- tius and Rosenmuller suppose that the two places were afterwards united and considered as one ; and this we think is the right solution of Neh. XI, 29 ; for Ain is probably identical with a site only 30 or 35' distance S. of Um er-Riimmamin, now called Tell-Khewelfeh and opposite another ancient site Ted Hora. Between the two tells is a copious fountain fiding a large ancient reservoir , which for miles around is the chief watering-place of the Bedawin-population of this region. A city at the base of which such a remarkable fountain existed, would well derive its name from it othe fountain\" , and its vicinity to Rimmon would justify both its distinct enumeration and its codective appel- lation. Rimmon (the rock). Thither the remnant of the Benjamites fled after the slaughter of the tribe at Gibeah (Judg. XX, 45, 47: XXI, 13) ; identified by Robinson (Bibl. Res. II, 113, 114) with the conical chalk-hill on which the vdlage Rummon is situated. about 2 hours E. of Bethel. The place was visited in May 1852 by Mr. Finn of Jerusalem, who describes (M. S. letter) the vd- lage as very flourishing ; he inspected four caverns there, two on"], [357, "345 the AV. side and two on the East; \u2014 .(these latter are the largest, and one has to pass through houses to get at them ; they are of no peculiar character , but rude slits as it were between strata of the limestone-hill, and never improved by art... The vidage people told M. Finn of two others of inferior size, which he did not visit. .(The hid is of itself a strong natural fortification on the S. and AV. sides, that is looking towards Geba... Rumah, a city only once mentioned in 2 Kings XXIII, 26; possibly the same with Ruma, a town of Galilee (Jos. B. J. Ill, 7, 21); now Tell Rumah or Harumah in the AVestern section of the plain of el-Biittauf (Narr. II, 404). See also Ritter XVI, 765. Saccaea, a town mentioned by Ptolemy in the province of Batanaea, in its Eastern part; identified by Porter (Five years &c. II, 60, 64, 260 sq.) with the vdlage Shiika. There are extensive ruins with inscriptions , one of which shows that it was an episcopal city in the fourth century. (See also Burckhardt, Trav. p. 76; Ritter XV, 921.) Salcah, boundary-city of Bashan (Deut. Ill, 10; Josh. XII, 5); be- longing to Manasseh (Deut. Ill, 13; Josh. XIII, 11; comp. I Chr. V, 11); Salecha by Jerome ; now Sulkhad, East of Bus- rah (Burckhardt, Trav. p. 100; Porter II, 184 sq.). Salim unear Enow, where John baptized ; 8 R. m. South of Scytho- polis (Onom.) ; now a site of ruins at the Northern base of Ted Ridgah (see Itinerary 13 and 14 May) ; near the ruins, at the side of a beautiful spring , is a wely to which the natives have given the name of Shekh Salim. The position agrees quite with the Onom. ; yet Robinson counts the reproduction of the name as nothing and disregards also the position (Lat. B. R. p. 333). Jerome regards this Salim as the city of which Melchi- zedek was King. Salt (the city of), belonging to Judah (Josh. XV, 62), probably so called because it was the great entrepot of salt for the consump- tion of the country. Its locality must, therefore, be sought for in the vicinity of Jebel Usdiim , at the Southern extremity of the Dead Sea. The salt of this mountain is even at the present day brought on camels to the market at Jerusalem. The only ruins near Jebel Usdum are those called Kul'at Um-baghek , or Em- Berhek, about 1% hour N. of its Northern end (De Saulcy, Journey round the Dead Sea, vol. I, p. 258; H. Poole, injourn. R. Geogr. Soc., London 1856, p. 61, 65). Here are the re- mains oof an extensive city\u00bb , with two pools , aqueduct and fortress. No other springs of sweet water, such as would be re- quired for the wants of city, are to be found for miles around the"], [358, "346 Jebel Usdum. I hold, therefore, Kul'at Um-baghek to be identical with the city of salt (Narr. II, 123). Salt(the valley of), whereAmaziah slew the Edomites (2KingsXIV, 7) ; evidently the valley S. of the marsh es-Sabkah at the Southern extremity of the Dead Sea. Distinct from the valley of Salt where David slew the Syrians (2 Sam. VIII, 3 \u2014 13; 1 Chr. XVIII, 12). The latter has been identified by Thomson (in Bibl. Sac.*1847, p. 406) with the salt-marsh es-Subkh , about 18 miles S.E. of Aleppo. Samachon, or Samochon, city on the Eastern mountains above the Lake Samochonitis ; probably the same with Semakh or Summak (Thomson in N. York Observer of 26 Nov. 1857 writes Sum- maeha), a site of ruins (.with buildings still standing)) and re- cognizable from afar by a very large lonely tree (De Forest, Tour in Mount Lebanon, p: 240). Samaria, name of the central part of Palestine under the Roman do- minion (Luke XVII, 11; John IV, 4, 5) from Samaria the capital. Now the village Sebustiyeh (from Sebaste, the name given to the city by Herod the Great after his imperial master), represents the ancient royal residence.

XV, 31) ; Rabbi Schwartz identifies it with Simsim, a vdlage N.E. of Gaza on AVady Simsim (p. 101) ; from the way in which it is enumerated with Ziklag and Madmannah, both evidently in this neighbour- hood, the identification seems likely to be the right one. Saphir (Mic. I, 11); between Eleutheropolis and Askelon (Onom.) ; perhaps one of the two villages es-Sawafir S. by E. of Esdiid. A third es-Sawafir surnamedlbn'Audeh lies an hour more East- ward (Bibl. Res. II, 370). Sariphea, an episcopal city in the plain of Judah , forming one congre- gation with Scarphia , a town in its vicinity (Reland, p. 987, 988) ; the two towns are now represented by Surafend and Safiriyeh. near Ludd and Ramleh. Among Jewish pdgrims Sariphea is mentioned as Saraphin (Carmoly, Itin. p. 217). Scala Tyriorum, or Ladder of Tyre ; now the rocky promontory Ras el- Abiad near Tyre, which is ascended by steps hewn in the solid rock. It is often confounded with another promontory more to"], [359, "347 the^ South , R-is en-Nakura , which resembles much the Ras el- Abiad and the situation of which agrees well with a statement of Josephus, i. e. 100 stadia to the N. of Akka. But Wilson has justly observed, that Josephus had probably the whole mountain range in view which at 100 stadia from Akka begins with Ras en-Nakura, and with which Ras el-Abiad is also connected (Lands of the Bible II, 231, 232; Ritter XVI, 727, 776, 801, 814 \u2014 816; Stanley, p. 264). Scythopolis, see Beth-Shean. Seir (mount), frontier-mark of Judah to the AArest of Kirjath -Jearim (Josh. XV, 10); the name and position suggest identity with Saris, the high situated vdlage S.W. of Kuriet el-Enab. Saris is also probably the same with Sores or Soris , one of the eleven cities interpolated by the LXX between Eltekon and Kirjath Jearim (Josh. XV, 59). See Later Bibl. Res. p. 156. Another Saris which Tobler saw from Soba towards the S. (Denkblatter p. 597) is probably a mistake. Selamis, or Selameh, a town of Galdee, fortified by Josephus (Vita \u00a737; B. J. II, 20, 6); now a site of ruins called Selameh, at the stream of that name, near its bend to the East; first mentioned by E. G. Schultz. Seleucia, a town mentioned by Josephus on the E. side of the Lake Semachonitis (B. J. II, 20, 6; TV, 1, 1; vita \u00a7 37). AVe were inclined to think this place identical with 'Adeikah, a deserted vdlage, on the mountain-side near a wady which runs down to the Huleh-lake, mentioned by Dr. De Forest (Tour in M' Le- banon, etc. p. 241), when an article in the New York Observer of 31 Dec. 1857 brought Seleucia to light under the shape of \u00aba confused jumble of stones caded Slukieh.o Ad what is said about it by the able author of this article , is, that there is a valley and brook on its South-side. AVe have some notion that Adeikah and Slukieh are one and the same place ; the name as heard by Dr. De Forest was perhaps indistinctly pronounced. Sephet, according to the Latin A'ulgate (Tobit I, 1 ) a city of Naphtali, the native place of Tobit ; Zephath of the Talmud (Rabbi Schwartz. p. 186) ; perhaps also Seph or Zeph of Josephus (B. J. II, 20, 6) ; now the town of Safed (Bibl. Res. Ill, 325 sq. ; AVilson II, 155); the Jews pretend that it was their chief city of refuge after the destruction of Jerusalem; they esteem Safed on this account as a holy place. Sepphoris, or Diocaesarea ; Josephus cads it (.the strongest city of Ga- lilee)) ; after the destruction of Jerusalem for a time the scat of the great Jewish Sanhedrin (Jos. Ant. XIV, 5, 4; 15, 4; XVII, 10,9; XVIII, 2, 1;B..I.II, 18, 11; 11-1,2, 4 ; Vita \u00a79 ; 45; 65);"], [360, "348 episcopal city of the Second Palestine (Reland, p. 217, 220, 228, 1001); now the vdlage of Sefurieh with a ruined castle (Bibl. Res. Ill, 201 sq.; Ritter XVI, 748). Shafram, a Sanhedrin-seat after the destruction of Jerusalem ; now Shefa 'Amar, a large village at the S.E. end of the plain of'Akka (Rabbi Schwartz p. 173, 174). Shalem ca city of Shechem\u00bb to which Jacob came from Padan-aram (Gen. XXXIII, 1 8) ; probably the same with the present village of Salim, about 5 miles E. of Nabulus (Bibl. Res. Ill, 102). Shamir, a city in mount Ephraim (Judg. X, 1) ; perhaps now Khurbet Sammir, a ruin visited by Dr. Barth in 1847 (Ritter XV, 471) about an hour E. of Yanun (near Akrabeh). Sharon (the plain of), the plain between the mountains of Ephraim and the sea, all the way from Joppe to Carmel. Lasharon in Josh. XII, 19. (Isa. XXXIII, 9; XXXV, 2; LXV, 2; Cant. II, 1). In a more limited sense the country around Joppe and Lydda is intended (1 Chr. XXVII, 29). (Ritter XVI, 587; Stanley, p. 481.) Shechem, now Nabulus (from Neapolis), city of refuge, given to the Levites (Gen. XII, 6; XXXVII, 12; Josh. XVII, 7; XX, 7; XXI, 21 ; XXIV, 1, 25, 32; Judg. VIII, 31 ; IX, 1 ; XXI, 19; 1 Kings XII, 1, 25; 1 Chr. AT, 67; VII, 28; 2 Chr. X, 1 ; Ps. LX, 6; CVIII, 7; Jer. XLI, 5; Acts VII, 16). (See for more details AViner, art. Sichem.) Shephelah, or Sephala, a name given to the maritime plain of Philistia, with the article: Ha- Shephelah (Deut. I, 7 ; Josh. IX, 1 ; X, 40; XII, 8; XV, 33; Judg. I, 9; 1 Kings X, 27; 1 Chr. XXVII, 28, 2 Chr. I, 15; IX, 27; XXVI, 10; XXVIII, 18; Jer. XVII, 26; XXXII, 44; XXXIII, 13; Obad. 19; Zech. ATI, 7; 1 Mace. XII, 38); see Stanley, p. 481, 482. Shihor (rather Shichor) \u2014 Libnath, othe Nde of glass\u00bb a river marking the boundary of Asher (Josh. XIX, 26) ; held by Masius, Michaelis, v. Raumer, Stanley, etc. to be identical with the Nahr Naman, the ancient Belus, the waters of which descend from the hills E. of'Akka and flow into the Sea some 20' S. of that city. Keil (comm. on Joshua p. 430) differs from this opinion and identifies the river either with tlie Nahr Keraji or with the Nahr Zerka S. of Dor. But from Josh. XIX, 26, 27 it would seem that the Shichor-Libnath is N. of Carmel. We may also add that on our journey from 'Akka to Yerka we saw, a little beyond el-Mekr, the hills which we ascended covered with a layer of glass, as if their masses had once been molten and mixed up with, an im- mense quantity of glass."], [361, "349 Shiloah (the waters of). Isa. VIII, 6; \u00abthe pool of Siloam,, (John IX. 7, 11); a fountain and reservoir at Jerusalem (see Bibl. Res. I, 493 sq. ; but especially Tobler, Die Siloahquelle und der Oel- berg) . Shiloh, city of Ephraim, N. of Bethel, S. of Lebonah, and E. ofthe high-way to Shechem (Judg. XXI, 19); 12 R. m. from Neapolis in Acrabatene (Onom.); now Seilun, a ruin-covered mound in the position as indicated (Bibl. Res. Ill, 87); (Josh. XVIII, 1, 8, etc. ; XIX, 51 ; XXI, 2; XXII, 12; Judg. XVIII, 31 ; XXl' 12, 19; 1 Sam. I, 3, 9, 24; II, 14, III, 21; IV, 3, 12 etc.; XIV, 3; 1 Kings II, 27; XI, 29; XIV, 2; Ps. LXXATII, 60; Jer.

XXVIII, 4; 1 Kings I, 3, 15; II, 1 7, 21 etc.) ; now Sulem a thriving village with gardens and orchards (Bibl. Res. Ill, 169 ; Wilson II, 88). Sidon, the famous Phoenician capital ; now Saida ; referred to in : Gen. XLIX, 13 ; Ezra III, 7 ; Zech. IX, 2 ; Matth. XI, 21 ; XV, 21 ; Marc. Ill, 8; VII, 24; Luke IV, 26; VI, 17; X, 13; Acts XII, 19; XXVII, 3 (see Winer, art. Sidon). Sihon of Jer. XLATII, 45 ; according to Movers and Hitzig the name of a city in Moab, distinct from Sihon, king of the Amorites, whose kingdom was bounded on the S. side by the river Arnon. Seetzen (Reise I, 411) and de Saulcy (Afoyage etc. I, 351, 352) describe a site of ruins on a hdl-summit, called Shihan on the S. banks of the Arnon. This may possible be the city Sihon. Compare Winer, art. Sihon. Simonias, a town mentioned by Josephus (Vita \u00a7 24. Reland, Pal. p. 1017), as situated on the hids N. of the plain of Esdraelon : now the vdlage Samunieh, about 2 hours E. of Nazareth (Ritter XVI, 748). Socoh, city of Judah in the mountains (Josh. XV, 48) ; identified by- Robinson (Bibl. Res. II, 195) with Shuweikeh, village in Wady el-Khulil, 3 hours S.S.W. of Hebron. Socoh, or Shochoh, city of Judah in the plain (Josh. XV, 35) ; identified by Robinson (B. R. II, 343, 349) with Shuweikeh, village in W. Musiir, 2% hours N.E. of Beit-Jibrin ; 9 R. m. from Eleu- theropolis (Onom.) The Phdistines with Goliath encamped near Socoh (1 Sam. XVII, 1). Fortified by Rehoboam (2 Chr. XI, 7) ; taken by the Phdistines during Ahaz's reign (2 Chr. XXVIII. 18). The valley oi Elah where David slew Goliath (1 Sam. XVII, 3) is Wady Musiir, where it joins W. es-Sumt (Bibl. Res. II, 350). Elah means otherebinth)) (Stanley p. 516)."], [362, "350 Sogane, a city of Gaulonitis (Jos. B. J. IV, 1,1; Reland p. 1120); discovered by Thomson (N. York observer 15 Oct. 1857) in a ruin of the name of Sujan, on the high brow of the mountains which rise above the Hiileh-marshes on the E. side. Having first visited from Banias the ruins of a temple near the AVely of Sidi HMa and a collection of springs below it, he ascended thence the mountains to Sujan. Sogane, a city of Galilee (Joseph. Vita \u00a751, andB. J. II, 20, 6) ; 20 stadia from Araba; and also 20 stadia from Gabara (Reland p. 1 121) ; now Sukhnin, a village in the centre of Galilee ; first visited by E. G. Schultz, and identified by Grosz (Ritter XAT, 76S ; see also Lat. B. R. p. 83, S5). There are at Sukhnin graves of famous Jewish Rabbis (Rabbi Schwartz p. 188). Sorek (the brook), Judg. XVI, 4; probably the present AVady Simsim . The Onom. mentions Kasr - Sorek, a hamlet near Siir'ah, on the banks of the present AVady Siirar ; but this latter vadey seems to run too far North to make its identity with the brook Sorek likely (see also Narr. of a Mission to the Jews in 1839 p. 107). Sores, or Soris, see Seir. Succoth, a city in the plain of the Jordan (1 Kings VII, 46); now Sukkuth, a site with a few foundations of houses at the side of a brook, about 1 mde W. of the Jordan and less than an hour N. of AVady Maleh. It is generally supposed that there were two towns of the name of Succoth (AAlner, art. Succoth and Ritter XV, 447); but the site of Sukkuth, on the AV. side of and close by the Jordan seems to us to answer perfectly with Gen. XXXIII, 17; Josh. XIII, 27 and Judg. IV, 5. (Narrat. II, 343; also Lat. B. R. p. 310-312.) Sychar (John IV, 5) is held by Robinson to be identical with Sicheni or Shechem (Bibl. Res. Ill, 120 ; Lat. B. R. p. 133) ; by others it is mentioned as a distinct town, E. of Shechem, near Jacob's well, and now represented by a ruined village called 'Askar (Eusebius; v. Raumer p. 146). Sanson (Halma p. 198) thinks that Iscariot has to be understood as the name of Judas' native place, and that it was situated to the E. of Samaria. If this is correct, 'Askar may be identical with Iscariot. The opinion of others, however, is that Iscariot means \u00bba man of Kerioth\u00bb. Taanach, royal city of the Canaanites (Josh. XII, 21) ; allotted to Ma- nasseh and assigned to the Levites (Josh. XVII, 1 1 ; XXI, 25 ; Judg. I, 27). Referred to also in Judg. V, 19 ; I Kings IV, 12: 3 or 4 R. m. from Legio (Onom.) ; nowTa'anuk, a village at the foot of a ted of that name, S E. of el-Lejjiin, on the border of the plain of Esdraelon (v. Schubert, Reise III, 164)."], [363, "351 Taanath - Shiloh , border-city of Ephraim (Josh. XVI, 6); 10 It. m. East of'Neapolis(Onom.), towards the Jordan; possibly the same with Tana, or 'Ain Tana, a ruin S.E. of Nabiilus, on the first plateau below Mejdel. Robinson is of the contrary opinion (Lat. Bibl. Res. p. 295). Tabor (mount), boundary-mark between Issachar and Zebulon (Josh. XIX. 22) ; here Barak collected his army (Judg. IV, 6, 12, 1 ll : referred to for its beauty in Ps. LXXXIX, 12; Jer. XL AT, 18; Hos. V, 1. There seems to have been a city of the same name upon the mountain, enumerated with the cities of Zebulon and Issachar, but assigned to the Levites (1 Chr. AT, 7 7). (Bibl. Res. Ill, p. 219, 220; Keil, Comm. on Joshua p. 427). Now Jebel et-Tur on the North-side of the plain of Esdraelon. Tra- dition points at Mount Tabor as the site of the glorification (Matth. XVII; Mare. IX; Luke IX) ; this is very uncertain. The city on the mountain occurs in Greek and Roman writers as Ita- byrion or Atabyrion. (Poujoulat Corr. d'Orient II, 135). Tappuah, a frontier-town between Manasseh and Ephraim (Josh. XVI, 8; XVII, 7, 8 En- Tappuah); possibly also the same with the royal city conquered by Joshua (Josh. XII, 17) ; but. this is very uncertain; now the same with 'Atiif, a deserted village about 4 hours N.E. by E. of Nabulus, with traces of antiquity (Narrat. II, 327). Here are ancient weds with excellent spring- water. Keil (Comm. on Joshua p. 397) supposes Tappuah to have been on the S.W. side of Shechem; compare v. Raumer p. 148. Tarichea, city 30 stadia S. of Tiberias (Jos. Vit. \u00a7 32), on the Lake of Tiberias (Plin. Hist. N. V, 14, 15). Fortified by Josephus ; taken by7 Titus under ATespasian ; given by Nero to Agrippa II (Bell. Jud. II, 20, 6; III. 10, 1-6; Ant. XX, 8, 4 ; B. J. II. 13, 2); now Kerak, a village on a tell, at the place indicated above. There are ruins and traces of ancient fortifications (Bibl. Res. Ill, 263). Tekoa, city of Judah (2 Chr. XI, 6) ; South of Jerusalem (Jer. VI, 1) : 1 2 R. m. from Jerusalem (Onom.) ; fortified by Rehoboam (2 Chr. XI, 6); the birth-place of Amos (Amos I, 1); hence the wise woman whom Joab caded (2 Sam. XIV, 2) ; here begins the desert (2 Chr. XX, 20; 1 Mace. IX, 33); now Teku'a, a mound covered with extensive ruins and enjoying a fine prospect of the desert and Dead Sea-vadey ; about 2 hours South of Bethlehem (Narrat. II, 30, 31). Telseae, a town mentioned in the Antonine tables, 16 R. m. from Ge- roda and 24 from Damascus. If Geroda is the modern JerM, as Porter suggests, we believe rightly, (Five years etc. I, 371) the above distances would fix Telseae at the present Kuteifeh (on the Damascus -Horns and Palmyra road), where a fine spring, large"], [364, "352 khan and scattered ruins indicate a site which was once inhabited in long past ages. Thamara, town and fortress in the time of Eusebius and Jerome, one day's journey from Malatha on the way from Hebron to Adah ; held by a Roman garrison (Onom.) Identified by Robinson (Bibl. Res. II, 622) with Thamar, Southern frontier-town of Palestine (Ezek. XLVII, 19; XLVIII, 28), and with the present ruined town Kurnub (Itinerary 31 March) about a day's journey AV. of die Southern end of the Dead Sea. The distance from Kurnub to Ted Milh, however, is not a day's journey, but only 4 hours : nor is Kurnub S. W. of the Dead Sea, where the Tab. Peuting. place Thamaro. Thebez, a city not far from Shechem, where Abimelech was kided by the hand of a woman (Judg. IX, 50 ; 2 Sam. XL 21) ; 13 R. m. from Neapolis towards Scythopolis (Onom.) ; now Tubas, a -vil- lage on the Nabulus-Beisan road, where the Onom. places it. Thella, a place mentioned by Josephus as situated in the vicinity of the Jordan (B. J. Ill, 3, 1 ; Halma p. 395) ; probably the same with Thala, a small tell with ruins not farN. of Wady el-Ferrah, below and S. E. of 'Atuf (Narr. II, 327). Tiberias, city (John VI, 1, 23; XXI, 1) ; built by Herod Antipas and called after the Emperor Tiberius; (Jos. Ant. XVIII, 2, 3; see also Vita \u00a7 65) ; for a time the capital of Galdee ; the seat of the Sanhedrin transferred hither from Sepphoris. Famous for its rab- binical learning and for the Mishnah which was here composed about 190 A. D. Episcopal city till the conquest of the land by- Omar; again during the possession of the Crusaders ; in 1187 taken by Saladin; in 1240 by treaty given to the Christians; since 1247 under Mohammedan dominion. The city was des- troyed by an earthquake on 1 January 1837. Considered by the Jews as one of the four holy cities of Palestine Tiberias, Jerusalem, Safed and Hebron). Extensive ruins are found on the S. side of the city. The Jews identify these with Rakkath of Josh. XIX, 35 and also with Chinnereth. Robinson thinks that there is no ground for the identification (Bibl. Res. Ill, p. 266 \u2014 274; v. Raumer p. 125 \u2014 127). Timnah, or Timnath, city of Dan, conquered by Judah (Josh. XV, 10 ; XIX, 43); here Samson's wife (Judg. XIV, 1, 5); possessed by, but taken again from the Phdistines (2 Chr. XXVIII, 18). There was another Timnah in the mountains of Judah (Josh. XV, 57), now unknown. Timnath of Dan seems to be the same with Timnath of Gen. XXXATII, 12\u201414. Timnath-Serah, or Timnath - heres, the inheritance and burial-place of Joshua (Josh. XIX, 50 ; XXLV, 30 ; Judg. II, 9 ; 1 Chr. VII,"], [365, "353 24) \u00abin Mount Ephraim on the North-side of the hid Gaash... Identified by Eli Smith (Bibl. Sacra 1843 p. 478 sq.) with Tibneh, a hill covered with considerable ruins, and facing another hill S. of the former with remarkable sepulchral caverns, the ornamented portico's of which are only equalled by those of the tombs of the kings at Jerusalem. This Tibneh lies on the way from Jerusalem to Mejdel, about 4 hours E.S.E. of the latter. Dr. Zunz in Ben jamin of Tudela, Asher's Ed., holds Timnath -heres to be the same with .(Kefr Chereso (probably Kefr Harit) \u00ab2 hours South.) (3% hours S.S.AV.) of Nabulus. (Also Rabbi Schwartz p. 151 ; Carmoly, Itin. p. 186, 212, 387, 444.) Tirzah, Canaanitish royal city (Josh. XII, 24); later the residence of Jeroboam (1 Kings XIAr, 17; XV, 21, 33; XVI, 8, 15 \u2014 23); beautifully situated (Cant. AT, 4). Brocardus mentions it as Therza, 3 hours Ii. of Samaria. Robinson thinks it to be the same with Talusa, about 2 hours N. of Nabulus (Later Bibl. Res. p. 303; comp. Narr. II, 334). This is probably the same vidage which Rabbi Schwartz (p. 150) cads Tarza on a high mountain E. of Samaria. Trachonitis, founded (peopled) by the posterity of Uz, the son of Aram (Jos. Ant. I, 6, 4). This district lay E. of Gaulanitis , and bordered on Auranitis, Batanaea and Damascus (Ant. XV, 10; B. J. LV, 1, 1 ; I, 20, 4). It has been elaborately proved to be the present Lejah, the singular rocky-, elevated mass in the great plain between Hermon and the Ha'uran mountains (Five years II, 259 \u2014 262); also identical with the district of Argob, con- taining threescore cities, which Jair, the son of Manasseh took, and which he called Bashan-havoth-Jair (Deut. Ill, 4, 5, 12 \u2014 15; comp. 1 Chr. II, 21 \u2014 23. Porter II, 268\u2014271). Tricomias, an episcopal city ofthe First Palestine (Not. Eccles. p. 215 sq.; Reland, p. 1046); now Terkumieh, a village between Hebron and Beit-Jibrin (Bibl. Res. Ill, 11, 12). Tripolis, sea-port of Phoenicia (2 Mace. XIV, 1 ; Joseph. Ant.

XIX, 29; 2 Sam. XXIV, 7 ; Ezek. XXVII, 3, 17; Hos. IX, 13); its relation with Israel (2 Sam. V, 11 ; 1 Kings IX, 11, etc. ; 2 Chr. II, 3, 1 1 ; also 1 Kings X, 22); other Scriptural references are : Ezra III, 7 ; Neh. XIII, 16; Ps. XLV, 13; LXXXIII, 8; LXXXVII, 4; Jer. XXV, 22; XXVII, 3; XLVII, 4; Ezek. XXVI; Zech. IX, 2; Matth. XI, 21 ; XV, 21: Marc. Ill, 8; VII, 24; Luke VI, 17; X, 13; Acts XII, van de Velde, Holy Land. 23"], [366, "354 20 ; XXI, 3 ; now Sur (see for its situation Geographical positions and Routes and Distances) . Ulama, a town 12 R. m. East of Diocaesarea (Onom.); probably now the vidage 'Aulam, E.S.E. of Sefurieh, somewhat further off than the Onom. indicates (Burckhardt, Travels etc. ; Ritter XV, 392; Bibl. Res. Ill, 219). Umma, city of Asher (Josh. XIX, 30). Thomson thinks it to be identical with 'Alma, a village on the high-land between Ras en-Nakura and Kul'at Shemma, 30' N. of a ruined town called Hamuta. (Bibl. Sacra 1855 p. 822 sq.) Usha , city with a Sanhedrin - seat after the destruction of Jerusalem ; now a ruin called Hiisheh, 30' S. of Shefa 'Amar (see Analysis Section 3) ; (Rabbi Schwartz p. 173, 174 ; Dr. Zunz in Benj. of Tudela, Asher's edition). Zalmon, a mountain near Shechem (Judg. IX, 48); now Jebel Sleiman, a high, conspicuous summit S. AAr. of and linked together with Mount Gerizim. Mohammedan tradition has favoured one of the peaks of Jebel Sleiman with a A\\Tely called Sleiman el-Farsi. It must be a different mountain from Salmon of Ps. LXATII, 1 4, as tlie summit of Jebel Sleiman is never covered with snow beyond what may fall on it for a few hours during an exceptional storm of winter. Zanoah, city of Judah in the plain (Josh. XV, 34) ; inhabited after the exile (Neh. Ill, 13; XI, 30); now Zanuah, vidage at the en- trance of W. Ishmad. (Bibl. Res. II, 343.) Zanoah, city of Judah in the mountains S. of Hebron (Josh. XV, 56) ; perhaps the same with Zaniitah, a village about one hour S.W. of Semoa (Eshtemoa). Seetzen spent here a night (Reise III, 29, 30). There are ancient ruins. Zara, Zora, Zoroa, or Zorava, ancient city of Trachonitis (Jos. Ant. XIII, 15, 4); episcopal city (RelaM, Pal. p. 548); Edh'radt of Abul- feda, 18 R. m. from Sunamein; identified from an inscription with Edh'ra, a village with very extensive ruins on the Western cliffs of the Lejah. (Ritter II, 860 ; Porter II, 220 sq. ; the latter identifies Edh'ra also with Edrei.) Zaretan, Zarthan or Zartanah, a town and perhaps also a district South of that of Beth-Shean (1 Kings IV, 12; ATI, 46; also Josh. Ill, 16). The name seems to have been preserved in that of Surtabeh , the peculiar mountain-group in the Ghor S. of Wady el-Ferrah. On its highest peak, Kiirn el- Sur- tabeh , are the ruins of a castle (Narr. II, 322, 323; Stewart p. 374)."], [367, "355 Zarephath, a Phoenician city, not far from Sidon (1 Kings XVII, 9, 10, Obad. 20; also Jos. Ant. VIII, 13, 2); Sarepta in Luke IV, 26 ; fortified place during the Crusaders' times (AVilken, Kreuzziige II, 208) ; now a site with a few fragments of ancient constructions at the sea-side, 3 hours, or even somewhat more S. of Sidon. In the village Surafend, on the S. side of the ad- jacent hill, the ancient name is still preserved (Bibl. Res. Ill, 413). Zareth-Shahar, one ofthe cities assigned to Reuben (Josh. XIII, 19); probably now the ruins Sara, which Seetzen found on a mountain near a hot spring half an hour from the beach of the Dead Sea ; the hot spring is S. of a simdar fountain in AV. Zerka Ma'in (Seetzen, Reise II, 369). Zebulon, frontier-city of Asher (Josh. XIX, 27 ; Joseph, de Bed. Jud. II, IS, 9; Reland, Pal. p. 129, 1062; AATiner II, 517; Ritter XAT, 6S7); now Abilin, a large vidage near Shefa 'Amar. Josephus speaks of its handsome buildings. It was destroyed by Ccstius. Zedad, boundary-place of the Promised Land (Num. XXXIAr, 18; Ezek. XLATI, 15); identified by Eli Smith with the village SMud, 1 2 hours S.E. of Hasya, a village on the caravan-road from Da- mascus to Horns. (Bibl. Res. Ill, 461; App. 271. Porter, Five years etc. II, 354, 355.) Zelah, or Zelzah, border-city between Benjamin and Judah. (Josh. XVIII, 28; 1 Sam. X, 2). Here Saul and Jonathan buried (2 Sam. XXI, 14).

XVIII, 22); probably on the hdl which in 2 Chr. XIII, 4 is caded mount Zemaraim, where Abijah stood when Jeroboam was defeated by the alarm-cry of Judah. Possibly the same with es-Sumrah, a ruin nearly 2 hours N. of Jericho on a hid in the plain. This ruin is not to be confounded with es-Samieh, a ruin N.AV. of es-Sumrah on the brow of the mountains, first visited by Dr. Barth (Ritter XV, 465). Zion (mount) , the part of Jerusalem where the fortress stood which David took from the Jebusites (2 Sam. V, 7). Zior, city of Judah in the mountains (Josh. XV, 54); probably now the vidage Sa'ir, 2% hours N.E. of Hebron. Ziph, city of Judah in the mountains (Josh. XV, 55); the desert to the E. and S.E. of the town caded after it ( 1 Sam. XXIII, 14, 15; XXVI, 1 etc.) ; fortified by Rohoboam (2 Chr. XI, 8) ; 8 R. m. East of Hebron (Jerome) ; now Tell Zif, a ted with traces of an ancient town, about 1% hour S.S.E. of Hebron. (Bibl. Res."], [368, "356 II, 191 ; Narrat. II, 75 sq.) It is different from Ziph, one of tbe frontier-cities of Judah towards Edom (Josh. XV, 24). Zoar, formerly called Bela (Gen. XIV, 2 ; XIX, 20, etc.) ; city at the S.E. end of the valley of Siddim, later the Dead Sea (Gen. XIII, 10 ; comp. Deut. XXXIV, 3) ; thither Lot took refuge. Although mentioned as boundary-mark of Canaan, yet Zoar appears never as a town of the Israelites, but as belonging to Moab (Isa. XV. 5: Jer. XLVIII, 34). After the captivity and under Aretas in- habited by Arabs (Jos. Ant. XIV, 1,4; B. J. IV, S, 4). Had a Roman garrison in Jerome's days. Episcopal city of Palestina Tertia ; famous for its balsam and date-palms; hence called by the Crusaders the city of Palm-trees ; Zoghar by Abulfeda (Ritter XIV, 108-110 ; Winer, art. Zoar). Robinson has with full par- ticulars proved that Zoar has no relation , neither in name nor position, with the ruin ez-Zuweirah in the valley of that name near the S.W. end of the Dead Sea ; but that its site was pro- bably at the entrance of AV. Kerak, S. side, where Irby and Mangles found the ruins of a city covering a space of at least half a mile in length. (Bibl. Res. II, 480, 648-651; Irby and Mangles, Travels, etc. p. 44S ; Poole, Journal R. G. Soc. Lond. 1856 p. 62, 63; Narrat. II, 110, 111). Zorah, city in the plain of Judah (Josh.

XI, 10); inhabited after the captivity (Neh . XI, 29) ; 10R. m. from Eleutheropolis (Onom.) on the way to Nicopolis ; now the vidage of Siir'ah, near the entrance of AV. Ishmafl, N. side (Bibl. Res. II, 340 sq. Ill, IS). Zuph (the land of), the district in which Ramah of Samuel was (1 Sam. IX, 4'. ; see art. Ramathaim zophim. The city of Ziph has pro- bably in Samuel's days given its name to this region, as well as to the desert to the E. and S.E. of it (see also AVoleott in Bibl. Sacra vol. I, p. 604).
