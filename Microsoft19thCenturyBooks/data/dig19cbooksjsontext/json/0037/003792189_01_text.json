After returning to Lodiana from my first visit to Kashmir and Little Tibet, in eighteen hundred and thirty-five, I formed a design of visiting Kabul. The direct route would have been through Lahore and Peshawur ; but my principal reason for not taking that road was, that I had beenwan dering in Kashmir, Little Tibet, and the Maharajah Runjit Sing's territories, for the best part of the year. I had been considered and treated as his guest, and had taken leave of him in his capital but a month or two before. On the twelfth of March, 1836, I quitted the hospitable roof of my friend, Captain (now Sir Claude Martine) Wade, and left Lodiana for Multan, intending to proceed thence through the Sulimani mountains to Kabul, in company with the Lohani kafilas, or caravans, after having delayed my depar-"], [27, "3 GUJA SING. ture for a few days, in order to be present at the return of the mission which Runjit Sing had sent to Calcutta, with presents for the King and Governor-General. Lallah Govind Jus, a confidential servant of the Maharajah, was its chief. Guja Sing, the second in importance, was a well looking and intelligent young dandy, often wearing the splendid yellow dress of the Sikhs, and sometimes the full uniform of a British general officer. He had a great turn for mechanics, and exhibited a theodolite of his own making ; and a model of the steam-engine, made for him by Mr. Prinsep, of Calcutta. He affected to say, at least so I was informed, that he had seen little that was new there, excepting the ships of war, which he allowed were wonderful ; but it was too evident that he well-knew he had only to recross the Sutlij to astonish his inquiring countrymen, and when dis coursing on his favourite topic, mechanics, b2"], [28, "4 LODIANA FETE. the energy of his manner, and his ani mated conversation were certainly not the offspring of oriental indifference. About two years ago, at Amritsir, he fell from a window into the street when intoxicated, and was killed. It would seem that he was desperately bent upon procuring an English wife. He fell in love with a lady at Cal cutta ; and was, it is said, prevented from marrying her only because it became known that he had already two or three wives in the Punjab. He wished to have remained there altogether, but Runjit sent down a request that nothing of the kind should be allowed ; and even went so far as to desire that he should be put under arrest, if he persisted in the latter determination. On his return, he commenced, without knowing one syllable of English, a serious flirtation in the language of the eyes (which seems to be the same all over the world) with some lady at Delhi."], [29, "5 ENGLISH SCHOOL. Before I started, I was present at a fete champetre given by Captain Wade, upon the occasion of the arrival of the mission. There was native dancing, sing ing, and sword playing. All the beauty and fashion of Lodiana were assembled to see the fireworks and illuminations. Characters from all quarters beyond the Sutlij were also present, magnificent Sikhs, scheming Kashmirians, pensioned Afghans, and supplicant envoys from Great and Little Tibet. The next morning; there was an examination of the boys of the Lodiana school, conducted by the Rev. Messrs. Wilson and Newton, the American missionaries, who deserve the greatest credit, and something more, for their vo luntary superintendence, and its results. To say nothing of the surprising answers given by the students, particularly to geo graphical questions, the examination was well worth attending, if it were merely to"], [30, "6 NOBLE SCHOLARS. see the motley assemblage of which the school was composed. The first in rank was the young Nawab Abdul Ghias Khan, nephew of Dost Mahomed Khan of Kabul. Next to him came three or four young Sikhs of an ennobled family \u2014 amongst them was Bissen Sing, a nephew of Kosheal Sing, Runjit Sing's chief jemadar, or captain, as he is called, par excellence ; and also a son of Kissenchund, the Sikh Vakeel or envoy resident at Lodiana. The rest of the school was composed of rising young Munshis and Baboos of great promise. After reading a passage in English, the boys were required to translate it carefully into Hindustani, and this was usually done with great cor rectness, and very little hesitation. Upon my return to Lodiana this year, I found that the school existed no more. The parents of the boys, Mussulmen and Hin dus, had become alarmed at the enforced observance of Christian religious exercises,"], [31, "SHAH SHUJA AND SHAH ZIMAN. 7 and withdrew their children from the school altogether. Baron Hugel, with whom I had travelled from Kashmir, and myself, were introduced by Captain Wade to Shah Shuja and Shah Ziman, the pensioned ex-kings of the coun try I was going to visit. We found Shah Shuja sitting on a chair, in a recess, or ra ther doorway, of his house, with a vista, formed by two rows of attendants, that di verged from it as from a centre. He ap peared to be a man aged about fifty, of the middle size, good-natured, and port-wine complexioned, looking more like a gentle man who had lost an estate, than a monarch who had lost his kingdom. He wore a dark coloured robe, a white turban, and white cotton gloves. Baron Hugel had been re ceived with great distinction by Runjit Sing ; I had come in for a share of it ; every application which the Shah made to the"], [32, "8 SHAH ZIMAN. Government went through Captain Wade ; and yet he allowed neither of us a chair, but kept us standing the whole time. His brother, Shah Ziman, resided in a different part of the building : we went to see him also : we stood ; he sat on the ground, pale, thin, dejected, and counting his beads. He asked much about Kashmir, and said that the shawls were not now so fine as they used to be. \" I remember,\" he said, \" when the finer fabric could be drawn through a ring.\" He was praising the beauty of Kashmir. \" Yes,\" remarked the poor blind monarch, \" Kashmir is certainly beautiful, and the air and water are good ; but,\" he continued, with a melancholy shake of the head, and a sigh as deep as I ever heard, \" Kabul, Kabul ! what is Kashmir to Kabul ! and I shall never see it again ! \" We were surprised to hear from Captain Wade, that in spite of their common mis fortunes and fate, the two brothers were"], [33, "9 DHURMKOTE AND FIROZPORE. not on the best terms with each other. The next morning, Shah Shuja sent us several trays, containing the best display of native cookery that I had seen in the East ; it had probably been superintended in management by the ladies of the haram. I think Lodiana the most interesting station in India, and that Captain Wade held the most important appointment, as political agent to the Sikhs. After a night's dak, or journey in a pa lanquin, I found myself at the village of Dhurmkote, and my horse in waiting for me. Two days' ride, over a flat and fertile country, brought me to Firozpore, a place only remarkable for the lofty walls of its fort ; which, in the distance, appeared to rise from the plain like a thick and regu lar clump of trees. Since the late meeting of Lord Auckland and Runjit Sing, it has"], [34, "10 HURRIPORE AND PAK PATAN. been put in a state of repair, and a new cantonment has been formed there, as being the nearest place to the Sikh capital, La hore ; thither, too, in case of need, the Bri tish cavalry and horse-artillery could arrive in a few hours after crossing the river. The next day, I was ferried across the Sutlij, after an hour's ride from the town. The river here is somewhat more than two hundred yards in width, from the Punjab side ; and it was then so shallow, that the ferrymen jumped into the water, to assist in dragging the boat ashore. The banks all around were flat, sandy, and uninteresting. On the same day, I arrived at Gullah, about seven miles in the interior ; and from thence passed through Pak Patan, a consi derable village, built on a mound, rising alone from a perfect flat. The last place mentioned by Arrian and Quintus Curtius, in their account of Alexander's march to-"], [35, "11 ROUTE OF ALEXANDER. wards the Sutlij, is Sangala. Mr. Masson, who had visited the ruins of Hurripore, or \" the green city,\" a few hours' march from the eastern bank of the Ravee, assured me that he felt quite convinced of this having been the site of Sangala ; and that a hill, and a lake, and other localities men tioned in the description of Alexander's victory over the Kathai, were then exist ing, in such a relative position to each other as to correspond exactly with the ac count given of Sangala by those authors. It may be inferred, from what follows, that Alexander went thence directly to wards the Sutlij, and built his celebrated altars. Pak Patan lies exactly east of Hurripore. But Alexander was surely too anxious about his glory to have built his altars on the plains of India, where they would be washed away by the river, which is constantly changing its course, otherwise I should have been very much inclined, with"], [36, "12 COUNTRY ROUND MULTAN. all deference, to have placed them at Pak Patan : the name signifies, literally, \" the clean ferry;\" whence we should imagine that the river once flowed close to it. It is now a few miles from the Sutlij, and the country is covered with a low jungle ; but the lofty mound on which the village has gradually risen cannot but suggest the idea of a substratum of ruins ; and the place derived an interest in my eyes upon the mere possibility of what those ruins might be. I think it probable that Alexander would rather have followed up the course of the Sutlij, for the purpose of building his altars upon the solid rock of the Hima laya. I believe that the trench and ruins first visited by Mr. Moorcroft upon the Sekunder, \u2014 the Dhar, or hill of Alexander, near the Mundeh country, \u2014 are the remains of his celebrated altars.

My next stations were Tibi, Lukhoki, Luka, Suldera, Tiba, and Mukdam-Ram. Six miles beyond the latter place the domes of Multan were visible over the jungle. I arrived there on the sixth of April, after a very uninteresting march, though without accident or robbery. Thanks to Captain Wade and Kissen Chund, Runjit Sing's vakeel at Lodiana, I had been furnished with a sufficient guard. There was a perfect flat or plain through out the whole distance, much was in cul tivation, but more was jungle, composed principally of a prickly mimosa, tamarisk, and byr-apple or jujube growing in isolated bushes, on a hard and sun- glazed soil. Where there was cultivation, the Persian wells were seen and heard constantly at 12"], [38, "14 PRODUCTS OF THE PLAIN. work, for the purposes of irrigation. The crops, chiefly of wheat and barley, were every where green, and looking remarkably well; those in the Punjab were, I think, the finest . the wheat in particular, which grew here, had no stunted stalk, and was often as high and as fine-looking as I have ever seen it in Europe ; but the Lahore wheat has always been celebrated. In the jungle were antelopes, hares, and black and grey partridges (francolins), in great abundance. Tigers are to be found in some parts of the jungle, and on the banks of the river. I did not hear of any lions, but I have known small ones to be bayonetted by Runjit Sing's hunting Sepahis, within two days' march of Lahore, and have seen their skins. Upon my arrival at Multan, 1 was domi ciled in a Bara-Deri (twelve doors) or summer house in the Bagh-i-Begi, made"], [39, "15 THE FAQUIR SHUMS-I-TABRIZ. by the Nawab Surfuras Khan, about thirty years ago ; it was cool, well-shaded with orange trees, and laid out in the usual manner, with reservoirs and fountains. The walks, intersecting each other at right angles, were raised above the parterres and flower-beds, that they might be dry when the latter are covered with water. There are numerous gardens in the environs of Multan, often formed around the shrine of some Mussulman Faquir ; and no man will quarrel with the fanaticism which has pro cured him shade and shelter in the cli mate of India. In the Hazur-i-Bagh, or the garden of the Presence, on the north side of the Fort, I saw a large tree, the Mowul-Siri, grown, as they told me, from a cutting, which was originally brought from Mecca; but I do not vouch for the truth of the story. The principal shrine is that of the Faquir Shums-i-Tabriz ; Shums signifies the sun in Persia. This"], [40, "16 GREAT HEAT OF MULTAN. holy man, they say, poor and wretched, made his appearance in the bazaar at Multan, and going to a Tabaki or cook's shop, requested permission to dress his dinner, which was rudely denied him. A similar request was made to another, and was met by a simi lar rebuff. The Faquir, proud and indig nant, called upon the sun to descend from heaven. The obedient luminary appeared in the air above the bazaar, and he cooked his dinner in its rays. The scorched and exhausted inhabitants of Multan crawled to him in terror, and implored him to send the sun on high again ; a request with which he at length thought proper to comply. Sir J. Malcolm, in his History of Persia, affirms that Shums-i-Tabriz was a great man of the sect of the Sufis, or oriental philosophers or free-thinkers. They be lieve in one God, and the doctrine of pre destination, and generally deny the exist ence of future rewards and punishments ;"], [41, "17 GREAT HEAT OF MULTAN. believing the soul after death to be re absorbed into the Divine essence. Some of this sect affirm that Christ was a Sufi. After this, it is not surprising that Mul tan should be found notoriously hot ; it is further a very dry place, although nearly within the full influence of the tropical rains of India: and it was singular that scarcely any had fallen for two years lately. I was, however, fortunate in the weather, which was cooled by repeated showers, so that the thermometer averaged only seventy-six degrees in the shade for the ten days, between the sixth and six teenth of April, that I was there. Multan, supposed to be the capital of the Malli, of Alexander's historians, is a dusty and slovenly-looking city, containing about forty-five thousand inhabitants. The streets are narrow, and the houses are two, c"], [42, "18 MULTAN. three, and four stories high ; flat-roofed of course, and built of sun-burnt brick, with a washing of mud over them. The city wall, about five-and-thirty feet high, is of the same material, but in a decayed state. Around Multan, in various directions, are numerous hollow ways of no depth, connected by a short cut or hole through the bank, when necessary. In the hot weather these are filled by means of a deep canal which com municates with the river Chenab. The Fort was built by Buran Bey, the son of the Emperor Jehan Guire, upon a mound that rises in the north part of the city, of which it occupies a considerable portion ; the city is about three miles in circumference. There are four gates, one of which is closed up by the order of the Maharajah Runjit Sing. The walls of the Fort, which in some places are sixty feet in height, with bastions at intervals of about seventy"], [43, "19 BUILDINGS IN MULTAN. yards, are in good repair, but mounted with a total of only six or seven ill-cast native guns. They have been surrounded by a ditch, in many places entirely de stroyed. In the interior of the Fort is the shrine of Mir Singh Puree, a Hindoo saint, and two lofty and spacious buildings erected over the tombs of two Mussulmen saints of great celebrity \u2014 Bhawul-Huk and Shah Allum.

Runjit Sing's cannon appear to have told with great effect upon the roofs of the principal mosques. Most of the buildings of the Fort were destroyed after the capture of the city, with the ex ception of these shrines and the house of Mazuffer Khan, which stands on the most elevated part of it, and commands an ex tensive view. This brave man, the last independent Nawab of Multan, lies buried in the Vestibule of Bhawul-Huk. For twelve years he resolutely opposed the in roads of the Sikhs, but the Fort was at last taken in the year one thousand eight hun dred and eighteen, by Kurruk Sing, the only son of Runjit, and present ruler of the Punjab. Mazuffer Khan fought in person at the Kederi gate of the Fort, and at last fell mortally wounded, after a desperate resistance.

Multan is famous for its silk manufac tures. I visited the house of a weaver ; it presented a very different appearance from the atelier of a shawl-maker in Kashmir: there I have seen twenty men at work in one room, here there are seldom more than three, who sit in a hollow in the ground, by which means their hands are brought down even with the tanee or woof, which is extended near the floor and fastened to a post not more than a foot in height. This apparatus takes up a great deal of room, whereas the frame of the shawl-worker, which is perpendicular, does not occupy a space of more than six square yards.

A very handsome kaish is finished in six teen days. That of the red colour is most valuable, it is dyed with cochineal, which is brought from either Bombay or Bokhara ; that from Bombay is one rupee a seer \u2014 about a shilling a pound. Multan is also famous for its carpets and embroidery. There are from a thousand to fifteen hundred maunds of tobacco produced around Multan annually.

I exchanged visits with Saman Mul, the governor of Multan : Runjit Sing has been heard to say, that he was one of the best officers in his service. Whilst I was at Multan, he sent me a kilaat or dress of honour, together with an elephant, and a couple of horses for my use, as an especial mark of his favour. He is a thin man, with a good tempered, and, for a native, a supe rior expression of countenance, and is said to have distinguished himself at the taking of the city. His government was well-spoken of by the Lohani merchants, who gave him an excellent character for justice in his dealings with them. He is the arch oppo nent of the minister Rajah Dhihan Sing, and his brothers Gulab and Sucheyt Sing, whose influence at the court of Runjit is usually all-powerful. On the eleventh of April, the Besak, a Hindoo festival, took place in the morning ;"], [48, "24 THE BESAK. I rode to the river, about three miles dis tant. The country which intervenes be tween the city and its banks was looking very green and picturesque, considering it is entirely flat : a great deal of land was under cultivation and bearing very fine crops of wheat. Well-planted gardens were always in sight; and date and palm trees standing singly or in groups, were frequently seen amongst the numerous topes or clumps of mulberry, mango, banian, peepul, and acacia trees. By the roadside were the venders of wreaths and fans made from the flags that grew on the water's edge. In the afternoon there was a fair in the Bagh Ali Akber, a garden with a shrine of a Fakir of that name. I saw the Multanis returning; every spe cies of conveyance had, of course, been put in requisition, horses, mules, donkeys, carry ing one or two persons, camels, each bear ing seven or eight women and children,"], [49, "25 NATIVE DESIGNATIONS. disposed on either side in trucks, and unlicensed bullock carts, with cargoes of giggling dancing girls. The number of persons who will stow themselves in these vehicles is quite astounding; all were in their holiday dresses. The Hindoo was to be distinguished by his cast-mark on his forehead, his rose-coloured turban, and red flowing trousers. The Multan Mussulman usually wore a white dress, of the same kind of pattern. The Sikh, generally a Sepahi, was recognised by his sword, matchlock, and accoutrements ; his scanty turban, his earrings, his would-be knee breeches, or his close fitting ill-made trou sers. The Lohanis, my future fellow-tra vellers, were conspicuous, by reason of the snake-like folds of their turban, and by their dark, swarthy, and manly features beneath them. Ferishta says, that Multan was three or four times chastised by Mah moud of Ghuzni, for revolt, and that he"], [50, "26 LEAVE MULTAN. marched thence across the Desert, in his way to Guzerat and Somnath. I quitted Multan the seventeenth of April, in company with Ameer Khan, a Lohani of the highest rank, who had one of the noblest countenances I ever be held. I was introduced to him at Lodiana, by Captain Wade. We were ferried over the river at the Rajghat in a large and clumsy, but useful boat. The Teenmu (three months), for so the stream is called, is formed by an union of the Chenab, the Jalum, and the Ravee, the two first forming a junction with each other about forty miles above Ahmedpore, receiving the Ravee at that place, which is, I be lieve, also about the same distance from Multan. The Teenmu is hardly a third part of the stream of the Indus, and yet at Multan it is half a mile in width : though much indebted to its sands and"], [51, "27 ARRIVAL AT LARGA. islands for this expanse, it is certainly a very large body of water, the main stream running beneath the right bank, with a depth of about five or six yards. After a fine morning's march, over a flat and desert country, with little shade, and very bad water, I arrived at Larga, a small, but neat-looking town, built of mud and brick, and nearly equi-distant from Dhera Ghazi Khan, and Dhera Ismael Khan. For twenty miles previously, I had a distant view of the Sulimani mountains, on the opposite side of the Indus, running, ap parently, from the north-west to the south east. The weather was hazy, and I could distinguish little besides a low waved out line. At Larga, I saw the sun set directly behind the Kayser or Tukt-i-Suliman mountain, distant about sixty miles.

My next stage was Karur. At a village called Radal, I acci dentally noticed a Zwanjera tree, produ cing a red gum, called, I think Chyr ; it was common, I was told, at Multan, but not in India. Karur resembles Larga, but is smaller : it stands on the edge of a plain, covered with the tufts of the gigantic grass, of which the huts throughout this country are made. They look like huge half barrels of straw, hooped with cables of the same material. The district is not desti tute of villages. In the jungle, I nearly run foul of a Cobra, whose motionless head was raised above the bush, in which his body was concealed, and bore so much resemblance to a dead branch, that I did not perceive what it was, until I was close upon him. On both sides of the river we passed a"], [53, "29 FERRY OVER THE SINDE. tamarisk jungle, swarming with wild boars. The ground was hard and dry at this season, but in June, when the river is swollen by the rains, that fall in the moun- tains, it causes such a flood that a boat can be piloted from Kurur for fifteen miles, to a village on the opposite side, and parallel with the banks for a much greater distance. I was first ferried over a small branch of the Sinde, about a hundred yards in width and seven feet in depth. We then rode for nearly a mile over an island of sand, and arrived at the Kyaree or Putah Ghat, where there is a ferry over the main stream. A grass hut, erected by the ferryman, afforded a shelter from the heat. The thermometer stood at one hundred degrees in the sun, by the boiling scale ; and I should estimate the elevation at about eight hundred feet.

From the moun tains downward to the junction at Mittun kote, it is called the Sinde, or Abu Sin, \" the father river.\" There is upon record an account of a Hindu or Sikh force, that chased a party of Mussulmen across the Indus, but refused to follow up their suc cess by crossing it themselves.

Half a-dozen strong, large, and useful boats, built of the Deodar or hill-cedar, fastened with iron clamps, and ornamented with carving, ply at this ferry, which is the richest of all. I was told that the ferryman received about two thousand five hundred rupees for pas sage money annually. The Lohanis from Calcutta, Delhi, Jypoor, all take this route to their rendezvous at Derabund. A duty of five per cent, was first levied upon their merchandise at Multan, the same that was paid in the time of Mazuffer Khan ; an other tax of one rupee, six annas, a maund, is levied at Larga, on behalf of the Ma harajah Runjit Sing, and another of six annas was then paid to Mahomed Khan, the Nawab of Dhera Ismael Khan."], [59, "33 ARRIVAL AT PURAWUR. After crossing the main stream of the Attok, I found myself on another island, covered with the dwarf tamarisk. I forded the thin shallow stream on the other side of it, and arrived at Purawur. I observed the boys of the village playing a regular English game of peg-top, the pegs were of wood. The Tukt-i-Suliman mountains bore north-west of Purawur. A furious tufan passed over me at this place, and rendered the air deliciously cool for a day or two afterwards. These sudden storms are common throughout India in the spring.

The jungle had disappeared, and I emerged on an open space of vast extent, destitute even of a blade of grass, and as flat as a bowling-green. It seemed to ex tend, with scarcely any intervening object, to the very foot of the Sulimani range. The Kayser mountain itself was a noble object, far higher and bolder than I ex pected to find it, and seemed to be a col lection of inaccessible precipices. The mountains of Kalabagh, containing the salt mines, were on my right; their isolated tops alone being visible above the horizon. On the north, the Sulimani range was finished by the Pahar, or hills of Koh-i- Tak ; and to the north-west was the Koh i-Kondi, with a little snow upon its sum mit. The Kayser mountain arose in front, in a southern direction. The Shirami hills appeared to descend into the plain, near Dhera Ghazi Khan. We dismounted at the village of Gundee. Near this place, I"], [63, "37 MOUNDS AND WELL. saw low mounds or hillocks, rising about thirty feet above the level of the plain, and, in circumference, about a third part of a mile. They are covered with broken bricks and tiles, and are, no doubt, the remains of villages. In the centre of one, I found a large pit, ten yards across, and forty feet deep. I was told, that a few years ago a fakir dreamed that a well was concealed there, which in duced Omar Khan, a Lohani chief, to open the pit. He found water, but it was very black ; and a well, sunk in the bottom of the pit, was filled by the ground falling in upon it. In the south-eastern corner, an old circular burj, a tower of red brick, ex ceedingly well-built, arose from the bottom of the pit to the surface, where it was about five feet in diameter. I saw another and a larger mound two miles to the south of Mysozyh, a village which we reached the next day ; it lay on the plain, precisely as"], [64, "38 NUMEROUS RUINS. if it were a mass of clay, that had been dropped from a great height, its sides fur rowed by the trickling of rain, and cracked by the action of the sun. The surface was every where covered with bricks, tiles, and Hindu ornaments made of baked clay ; so much so, that at first sight it was impos sible not to suppose that the place had been a brick kiln, such as is seen near Agra and Delhi. The vicinity of a flat space, similarly covered, served to strengthen such an opinion ; but its circumference of half a mile, and its height of fifty feet, were suffi cient to assure me that there had been a town on the plain, and that the mound contained the ruins of its protecting fort. Blocks of stone, which had once been squared, and large flat bricks, fifteen inches wide at the larger end, and so shaped as to have belonged to a circular building of se ven yards in diameter, were scattered in every direction. I also found numerous"], [65, "SEARCH FOR ANTIQUITIES. 39 fragments of Hindoo idols, particularly of the little humped-back bull. I subsequently set men working to search the remains of another old town, not above a mile from the camp. They brought me nothing but some old pice (halfpence), with the empe- ror Jehan Guire's name upon them ; and some sifted earth, which contained, as they told me, a few minute particles of gold. A fourth, and yet larger dhera, as these mounds are called, exists in the neighbour- hood of Derabund ; it is perhaps a furlong in length, and rises to about the height of eighty feet above the plain. Close to it are the ruins of a town ; and both are washed by a mountain torrent, that has swept away one side of the mound, and formed an overhanging cliff, in which red brick and layers of mortar are to be seen, together with rounded stones taken from the old bed of the torrent, for building pur poses. The Thanadar, or chief man of a"], [66, "40 FORMATION OF MOUNDS. village, dispatched persons to dig for me, on condition that I should cure his eyes for him, which were not the better for a hot needle that had been drawn between the lids by a Poshtu practitioner. I procured nothing remarkable from this mound. There were five or six more similar to it scattered over the plain. Their formation is not, I think, difficult to account for. Water in these countries is never left to itself: a well is first built ; then a village rises ; then a fort, usually quadrangular, if we may judge from those of the present day, is created. The well becomes dry and choked up, and the inhabitants leave this home for another, where better water or pasturage has been found; cleared land has proved productive ; a new and more advantageous market has been opened, orwhere the preda tory visits of the Vuziri mountaineers have become less frequent.

Incipient hillocks, formations ofthe same kind, may be remarked around the roots of every bush in the country. On the twenty-seventh of April, we reached the Lohani camp at Mysozyh, a small village protected by two mud forts, into which they could retire in case of an attack by the Nawab of Dhera Ismael Khan. When the kafila or caravan is ab sent, they perhaps would not rind a hundred men to defend the fort, and they would be obliged to retire into the Sulimani moun tains for protection. Ameer Khan, my Lohani friend, was soon surrounded by a host of"], [68, "42 LOHANI CAMP. his kinsfolk, men and boys. I was much amused with the formal mode of salutation in use amongst the Lohanis. When they met, \u2014 even the oldest friends or relations, it seemed to make no difference, \u2014 the oriental embrace was first given ; that is, each person passed his head over the left shoulder of the other, and then over the right, so that the breasts were brought in contact. The one then asked the other, in Poshtu I believe, \" Shei jur ?\" \" Are you well ?\" and was answered with the same question; secondly, \" Shei pakhair ?\" \" Are you strong ?\" and was answered again by the same question ; thirdly, \" Rogu shei ? \" (I believe), \"Are you safe?\" and two or three more, were answered in a similar manner ; they then embraced again, and the salutation was finished.

The men were occasionally richly appa relled ; they had silks and shawls at com mand ; and though there was often too great a display of finery on their own persons, they did not always exhibit the carriage and bold bearing of the Patan or Afghan soldiers.

I retired for shelter to the gateway of the little fort, which I found was the coolest place, as there the heat never exceeded ninety-two. The Lohanis, who were waiting the arrival of a caravan from Multan, passed their time as they best could. They formed in groups under any shade they could find, chatter ing, smoking, and sleeping away the hottest part of the day, rarely moving, excepting when aroused by the call to prayers, or to get a chance shot with the pellet bow.

If they sell a poor Afghan an ox, for instance, at a year's credit, the creditor, with two or three of his friends, will take care to wait upon their debtor in due time, treating him with great courtesy, and perhaps observing some delicacy in making their demands; but they compel payment of the money, by residing in the poor man's house, as his guests, till the cash be forthcoming, as the laws of hospitality will not permit him to turn them out.

Some years since, they determined to resist his exorbi tant taxation of their merchandise. I was informed that he entered their country around, with three thousand men, and se ven pieces of cannon. The Lohanis assem bled from all quarters, and were more than numerically equal to the invader. They fired at each other for twenty-four hours ; but the Lohanis had the advantage, as the lights which he burnt enabled them to pick off his men during the night. The Loha nis \u2014 such is their own account \u2014 lost two hundred and fifty men ; and the Nawab was obliged to retreat, with the loss of four hun dred, two or three of his cannon, and with a diminished revenue.

The monarchs of Kabul were more lenient, exacting only five thousand rupees yearly, for the two villages of Derabund and Mysozyh. I do not quite vouch for the accuracy of these statements, having heard of them only from the Lohanis themselves. Derabund is a wretched looking village, a collection of low mud walls, well watered by a mountain stream, and tolerably sheltered by a few mimosa and tamarisk trees. It is surprising that no mango topes, or clumps, have been planted, considering how long the Lohanis have dealt with the country as their own, and the great heat to which they and their families are exposed, and how much beholden they are to shade for their"], [84, "58 EARTHQUAKE AT DERABUND. health and comfort. The slope of the plain is the most deceitful I have ever seen. As the Attok pursues its course some distance from the mountains, there can be no doubt that the ground descends from them to the river ; but I could hardly believe it to be the case, had I not seen stream after stream running downwards. Derabund and My sozyh are just sufficiently distant to com mand what may be termed an horizon be tween them and the mountains ; and the real declivity being very slight, the ground appears to drop a little on the other side of it. Derabund was much injured by an earth quake which occurred five years back, early in the spring. It was felt from Peshawur to Dhera Ghazi Khan, but the centre of its violence was at Derabund.

There would be a certainty of detention until a large sum of money was paid, the paths were few and difficult, and there was no possibility of avoiding the mountaineers, who were numerous and lawless.

The Tukt-i-Suliman, from the plains, appears to be a serrated ridge, mural and perpendicular near the top, shaped somewhat like a horse-shoe, with a circular end to the north. It rises much above any other mountains in sight. The Lohanis say it is higher than any hill between Derabund and Kabul.

When the crude naphtha is submitted to careful distilla tion, there first comes over a small portion of water, to the presence of which the turbidness ofthe liquid is due ; the liquid in the retort then begins to boil, and the pure naphtha passes over, the boiling point rising all the time, until at last there remains a dark-coloured, almost opaque, pitch-like matter, which becomes solid as it cools.

They desisted, as the rescue approached. The stoppage of the water-courses was another serious cause of a quarrel.

A person wishing to travel with the first, should calculate upon arriving at Derabund before the tenth of April ; if with the second, before the twentieth or twenty fifth ofthe same month ; the third or largest is more uncertain, but its day of departure is usually the tenth or twelfth of May. The first kafila carries with it the coarse goods of Moghiana (a town situated on the Chenab river), and the salt ofthe Punjab. The whole of these goods are disposed of at Ghuzni, Kabul, and Kandahar. The camels ofthe second kafila are burdened with indigo, pur chased at Multan and Buhawulpore, and the chintz of Hindustan. Some part of this investment finds its way to Bokhara. The third, which is the largest, consists of the Lohanis Sirdagur, who cannot exactly time their arrival, as they travel from Hydrabad, Calcutta, Benares, Delhi, Jypore, and the"], [97, "69 RETURN 3IERCHANDISE. other large cities of India. The bulk of their lading consists of kimkab or golden cloth of Benares, English chintzes and cali cos, gun-locks, and similar articles. A great proportion of these goods is transported beyond the Hindu Kosh. The last and longest of the Lohanis kafilas moved back this year from Ghuzni towards Derabund, on the fifteenth of October. They carry pomegranates, almonds, raisins, and ruwash, from Kabul : and from Bokhara, horses, co chineal, nankin, gold thread, raw silk, and other goods. The Emperor Baber cursorily mentions the Lohanis several times, in his memoirs. He appears to have considered and treated them as natives of Hindus tan, who were opposed to the progress of his arms in that country. They traded then as now, and their merchandise was of the same description. Ferishta mentions that Bahadur Khan, son of Duria Khan Lohani, governor of Behar, assumed the"], [98, "70 EXCESSIVE HEAT. title of king, under the name of Mohamed Shah, and found himself, shortly before his master Ibrahim was defeated by Baber at Paniput, at the head of one hundred thousand rebel horse, and that he beat the Delhi (Ibrahim's) troops in several engage ments. I do not find him mentioned in Baber. Besides the Lohanis, there are five or six kafilas which annually pass the Hindu Kosh for Bokhara, laden with various wares. We marched on the nineteenth of May, and encamped under some trees, at a place called Lalukote. Up to the eighth or twelfth, the weather had been tolera ble ; on that day the thermometer stood at ninety-eight degrees, in the shade of a well-covered mud building. It had risen gradually every day ; and on the twentieth, it stood at one hundred and eleven, in the same building, although it was cooled as much as possible by a frequent sprinkling of water on the floor. In the open air, the"], [99, "71 KAFILA ON THE MARCH. hot gusts were like the heat of a furnace. I kept off fever by sleeping in the open air, abstemious and regular diet, breakfasting on suji or the heart of wheat, with water ; dining on a boiled chicken, or chicken broth ; and drinking a very considerable quantity of black tea. We were now fairly en route ; and, con sidering all things, it was surprising how little confusion there was. About two hours before daylight, the whole kafila was in motion, preceded by a few straggling match lock men, and a drummer to beat the alarm. Then followed the numerous camels, laden and unladen. The ladies of the Zunanas rode upon a kind of square platform, com posed of innumerable cushions; at each corner arose a small tower of the same formation; protected and supported by these, they seemed to be exceedingly com fortable. Chocolate, trimmed with a little"], [100, "72 LOHANI LADIES. yellow, was the predominant colour worn ; and the whole turn out, the camels included, was ornamented with fringes and devices, made of cowrie shells. The shyness with which the ladies at first regarded the Feringi, now wore off a little ; and they often seemed careless of being observed, covering their faces but very scantily. Some of them were exceedingly handsome ; usually very fair, with regular features, black hair, eyes hazel, and blackened eyelids. The young girls wore a single braid in front, which supported a piece of gold, a coin, or other ornament, dangling between the eyes. The married women wore massive gold earrings, composed of thin plates, strung together. Children were perched in every place, and in every attitude ; most of them had an unhealthy look, and bad eyes, ari sing from the enormous quantity of grease and sweetmeats they were allowed to eat ; they resembled puppets, and wore caps,"], [101, "73 BOKHARA ASS. shaped like those of a Spanish inquisitor. The cavaliers pranced along gallantly by the side of their ladies, usually riding on mares, as horses would be incessantly fight ing. I was myself obliged to change my English curb and snaffle for a \" Regulus\" bit, studded with blunted spikes. The composure with which the horse, a very spirited animal that Runjit had presented to me, conducted himself afterwards, was surprising ; whereas, before, it was a ser vice of constant danger to myself and others to ride him. Herds of cattle, of the half-bred humped breed, light, active, and not easily fatigued by wading through streams, and treading over rocks, were mixed up with goats and sheep, that were threading their way amongst the larger animals. An ass of Bokhara, the only one of the caravan, attracted my attention ; it was white, and a very noble animal, much larger than any I had ever seen before. 12"], [102, "74 KAFILA ENCAMPING. The price at Bokhara was about sixty Kabul rupees, or four pounds sterling. I am not aware of a caravan in any east ern country where the manners of a Mus sulman family can be so well observed; nor do I think there is any place, where the Mahometan women of rank appear so much in public. Upon arriving at \u00a9ur ground, it was always surprising to observe the celerity with which the camels were unladen. The burdens were piled up like a wall, on the western side of the tent, so that the owners' heads might rest against it, in the direction of the prophet's tomb, at Mecca. The tent, or rather a dark brown pall, was then pitched, generally by the ladies, and in ten minutes all was ready ; a short meal, and a long siesta followed ; and for three or four hours the whole camp was so hushed, that had it not been for the eternal braying of the sleepless"], [103, "75 ZURKHANEH. donkey, I should not have been aware of its existence. In the afternoon, every one was awake ; the camels were driven in by the watchmen ; the men seated themselves in groups, to smoke and chat ; women gos sipped from tent to tent ; and the children were enjoying the inexpressible pleasure of making a noise. The evening meal was then prepared, and the tents struck, before they retired to rest, so that there might be no delay in the morning. The guards loudly challenged throughout the whole of the night, firing their matchlocks, when ever they thought prowlers were at hand. The next morning, not more than a quarter of an hour elapsed, between the commence ment of the bustle, and the general move forward. Zurkhaneh was the next station. The march was a short one, but with little shade. The Nawab takes two thousand"], [104, "76 A FAIR PATIENT. rupees yearly from the sheik of this dis trict. The next march was of sixteen miles, to Shonkul, a station bare of trees, and where the mercury rose to one hun dred and eighteen degrees in my tent. There the Lohanis hailed with joy the stream of the Gomul, from which we drank ; it came, they said, from Belat, four days' march this side of Ghuzni. I was getting into great reputation by the distribution of medicine. A few days before, I had saved the life of one of the principal Lohanis, who was dangerously ill with dysentery. My next patient was a young lady, from one of their Zunanas, veiled of course, and in company with other women ; but I saw all the lower part of a very pretty face, by assuring her it was quite necessary to see her tongue. I made her uncover both her arms, which were richly ornamented, by expressing a serious"], [105, "77 MANJIGHURRA. anxiety to ascertain the state of both pulses. I advised on her case, and, I suppose, suc cessfully, as she did not visit me again. Our line of march now lay to the north west, following the course of the stream ; and the caravan encamped at Manjighurra. From this place, the Tukt-i-Suliman bore south-south-west. The town of Derabund was in the south-east. Dhera Ismael Khan, and the hills of Karabagh, lay to the eastward. The town of Tak, the re sidence of a Rajah, or Nawab, is situated in the plain, about fifteen or twenty miles to the northward. The Lohanis told me, he received a tax of two rupees, from every laden camel, and that his family were ori ginally Lohani. He was then said to pur chase exemption from trouble, on this side the Attok, by paying yearly, a sum of several thousand rupees, to Runjit Sing, but his dominions were invaded shortly"], [106, "78 MOUNTAINEER ROBBERS. afterwards; he fled from the superior power of the Sikhs, and when I was at Kabul, he came in person before Dost Mahomed, sitting in full durbar, to throw himself and his family on his protection. I had not believed all the stories I had heard of the bold ferocity of the Vuziri Paharis, or mountaineers. Ameer Khan would never allow me to move from the camp, even for a few yards, as night drew near. At this place, two men, who had been lying a little away from the edge of the crowd, were killed with swords in the night ; one, whilst he was asleep, and the other for crying out, and giving the alarm. The feeling of hostility against the Lohanis had its origin, in their refusing to pay any thing for permission to pass through the moun tains. I think the demands of the moun taineers are justifiable, as the Lohanis pay permit money in every other country they pass through, from Calcutta to St. Macaire,"], [107, "79 SKIRMISH. or Makari, as they term it, on the frontiers of Russia. The consequence of their with holding it, is a bloody feud, producing robbery and vexation. I used to tell Ameer Khan, and the other Lohanis, they were wrong not to make an arrangement, and pay some trifle, however small, and I am not sure they were not of my opinion, although they did not say so, merely re marking, that it would be of no use, and that the depredations would still be con tinued. The next day we made a short march into the territories of the Tak Rajah, and an hour or two afterwards arrived at the foot of the hills, the entrance to them being in full view. Suddenly the alarm was given, and the fighting men of the Kafila went forward, under a terrific heat, to take possession of a gorge in the mountains, to where marauders, who had been watching"], [108, "80 DISTURBED STRATA. the opportunity, had driven off some camels. They returned at night, with the loss of five, and two men wounded. I now found that events of this kind were of daily oc currence. The next morning, to my great joy, for I was much weakened by the heat, we fairly entered the hills, by a low pass, formed entirely, as indeed the country had been for three days past, of hardened shin gle, and disturbed strata, rising at every quarter and at every angle. The three last changes that have taken place in the surface of the country were easily remarked. The lowest stratum, of mountain lime-stone, was so arched and contorted, that it must have been subjected to more than one con vulsion. The shingly deposit that covered this stratum, was not raised with the lime stone, as it no where yielded to its configura tion. Whenever the shingle was seen on the mountains, in the interior, it lay in denuded and horizontal strata, so that the low, bro-"], [109, "81 GEOLOGICAL APPEARANCES. ken, and confused masses which skirt the plain, and have no visible substratum of limestone, must have been shaken into their present position by subsequent con vulsions, causing them to sink from their original level. No man in his senses can deny that these had once been covered by the sea. Every pebble in the country was rounded by the action of water ; and rem nants of marine shells, and a vast profusion of Ammonites and Nummullites, were scat tered over the encamping ground. The next day's march was to Rylu, and we halted on an open plain, apart from the river. The water we drank was brackish, brought from a spring at the foot of the mountain, on the east side. The space around the spring was described to me as being almost covered with fragments of shells and marine remains. My ser vants brought me some specimens, similar to those I had picked up the day before. G"], [110, "82 VTJZIRI ROBBERS. The mountain summit appeared to be com posed of greyish limestone ; on the bank below it there was chalk ; and beneath that I think there was a bed of marl. I regretted very much that the intense heat prevented my going there myself, as in all probability I should have found fossil remains. On the thirtieth we marched for several miles through a defile formed by perpen dicular walls of shingle, varying in height from fifty feet to two hundred, and in width from twenty to three hundred yards. This spot is a favourite haunt of the Vuziri robbers, as the caravan is necessarily much exposed and the cavalry is unable to act. A gorge which opens into the defile was described to me as the scene of an action three years before. Nine hundred robbers made their appearance, cut off the leading camels, and drove them to the mountain, but they were recovered after two days' fight-"], [111, "83 LOHANIS SHOT. ing.

A coun cil of war was held, and it was judged ex pedient, for fear of the mountaineers, that the caravan should be divided into two parts, and that one should march two days before the other ; by this means, the con fusion that would arise in case of another attack on such a dense crowd might be avoided. Lots were drawn by the prin cipal Lohanis, and it Avas decided that we should march first ; but so numerous was the caravan, that there did not appear any difference, in point of numbers, then or before. On the first of June we encamped at Shydan, by the river side. During the two last days water had only been procured by scraping away the ground, and had been alike scarce, brackish, and unwholesome. On the way to Koteghye, the next day, we passed the scene of a battle that took"], [113, "85 LOHANI GRAVE-OFFERINGS. place some fifty years ago : the Vuziri mountaineers came down in such force upon the Lohanis, that it was deemed pru dent to listen to their demands. A certain sum was to be paid to them at a distance from the camp ; a scramble ensued for the rupees, and those who got none insisted upon more being paid them. A fight was the consequence, which ended in favour of the Lohanis ; but a considerable loss of lives on both sides took place. A pile of stones covers the Lohanis' graves, and a wall of the same material surrounds them. Sticks are inserted amongst the stones, and upon these are generally put the offerings of their friends, in the shape of wreaths and pieces of cloth.

I tell the tale as it was seriously told to me, without vouching for the truth of it. I was delighted to find the horns of this animal, of which I had never before seen or heard. When I was at Kabul, Mohamed Akber Khan, the se cond son of Dost Mohamed Khan, who was out on an expedition in Lughman, killed one in the mountains and sent it to me.

The circumference of its fore-foot was nearly eleven inches ; its massive horns were thirty-one and a half inches in length, lyral in their general outline, but having two spiral curves between the roots and the point. It had five grinders in each jaw, and eight front-teeth in the lower jaw. It had no suborbital sinus, which the ibex has. I should place it as the link between the ibex and the common goat, which it more resembles than any animal I know. In Greece, where the goats' horns are very large, I have seen some that closely resem bled those of the markhur, excepting in size. The colour of this goat is rufous brown, generally ; its head more of a cho colate colour ; its beard, which is very long and extends from the chin to the breast, is a clear yellowish white; tail black ; rump and legs, downwards, hocks"], [116, "88 MOUNTAIN STRATA. and knees included, dirty white ; black over the rump and hocks ; and a black stripe, gradually lessening, passing from behind each knee to the front of the fet lock joint. It is common in Little Tibet and the higher mountain country lying between the Indus, Budukshan, and the Hindu Kosh. In Little Tibet it is seen on inaccessible precipices, of little elevation, overhanging the river. On the third of June we crossed the stream of the river at least fifty times on the way to Kangur, an open space, on which arose a lofty bank of alluvium. The mountains are formed of schist and lime stone ; the strata lying at every angle, and often capped with shingly deposit. Still following up the course of the river, on the fourth of June we encamped at Ursuk. From this place the Tukt-i-Suliman was visible to the east-south-east.

A strong party of Lohanis mounted in the heat of the day, but returned soon, saying it had been a false alarm. In the afternoon a grass-cutter, who had wandered too far, returned to the camp ; he had been seized and frightened by fifteen Vuziris, who told him that they were all concealed on the ground when the Lohanis passed within a quarter of a mile of them.

About ten days before, I had been requested to attend upon a sick Lohani, a near relation of Ameer Khan. He was a young man, tall, stout, and very fat. I found that he had had fever for two days; his eyes were starting from his temples, and his cheeks swollen and flushed. I gave him some medicine ; and, the next day, had him bled in the hand by a native practitioner. Even this was only allowed by my most earnest entreaties. A prayer was said by the friends"], [119, "91 MEDICAL TREATMENT OF SICK. who surrounded his bed, before the vein was opened, and a small cupfull of blood was all they would allow to be taken ; Ameer Khan holding his other pulse whilst the operation was going on, and expressing his surprise and pleasure at the sudden alteration for the better. The invalid, finding immediate relief, sat up in bed, and swore that he must eat something directly, or that he should die from starvation, having eaten nothing for two days. I was obliged to allow him some broth, and I believe he ate a great deal more when I was absent. I was astonished at the little idea these people had of keeping an invalid quiet. I sent his friends away several times from his bed; but immediately as my back was from them, they returned like bees to a hive.

I was one day obliged to hand outside of my tent-ropes, by force, a conceited, simpering, young Syud, a descendant of the Prophet, who would persist in sitting by the invalid's bed, afterl had civilly requested him to depart five times. Unaccustomed to such treatment, \u2014 for he was a holy man, which luckily I did not know, \u2014 he turned pale with fear and passion ; and, grasping a handful of stones and sand, was going to throw them at me, muttering with a choked voice, in Persian, \"Now, I will kill you, you Infidel.\" It was lucky he was not armed. He walked off in a rage ; and I retired into my tent, with my shirt-sleeve torn in the scuffle. The affair was amicably settled by Ameer Khan, on the understand ing that I did not know him to be a holy man. Meanwhile, in spite of my entreaties,"], [121, "93 KORAN CHARMS. they still persisted in feeding my patient ; and, consequently, there was a great in crease of fever. All my remonstrances were of no use ; they would not again allow me to bleed him. Scraps of the Koran were tied around the sick man's neck. One fellow was for giving him a fish sherbet, by way of something very cooling ; another called for a cup of cold water, and, having muttered a prayer over it, held it close to the sick man's face, and blew over it precisely as a conjuror does when he says, \"Presto, \u2014 be gone.\" An other passed a lighted piece of paper, on which was written a verse of the Koran, around his head, and held it smoking under his nose ; this, of course, had much the same effect as a cup of salt-and-water.

His friends, how ever, were so desperately afraid that I should take more blood from him, or com pel him to take more medicine, that they kept him in their own tents, refusing him nothing he asked. His fever again returned ; and on the next day, at his own request, they adopted the very primitive treatment of wrapping him in a wet cloth, from head to foot, with a strong, hot wind blowing upon him. At night he was gasping from inflammation, and to bleed him to the extent that was necessary was quite out of the question. I procured him some repose by a powerful dose of medicine, and putting his feet in hot water ; to prepare which, my"], [123, "95 BAD TREATMENT AND DEATH. servants and self were disturbed three times in one night. All entreaties and expostula tions were vain ; the next day I saw the wet sheet around him again. He then felt him self sinking, just as we were only a few days' march from the cool air of Khoras san. He now sent for me, and presented me with a small flower, adding that it was of Khorassan, that the air and the water there were cool, and that he had again hoped to see it. His hand was like ice. Ameer Khan said, \" that now he was bet ter.\" I took Ameer aside, and told him he could not live above five or six hours ; at which he seemed shocked. The poor fellow died in the night, as I had fore told, and was buried at the next station. His friends carried his body on a chahar pase, or \" four feet \" (a bedstead). On the road, the day before he died, we passed the grave of a Lohani of rank ; they bore the body up to it, muttered a hasty prayer to"], [124, "96 DESERT GRAVE. the departed saint, and pushed forward. He was buried at Semla Borag, the next station, completely sacrificed to the bo ok bound ignorance of Mahometanism. His friends buried him on a bleak and barren mountain-desert ; a heap of stones his only monument ; the wild goat's horn his only epitaph ; and the murmuring of the Gomul his only requiem. No vestige of a habitation was near him. His grave designates the place to the eastward of which the snows of Afghanistan are rarely known to fall. Thanks to the doctrine of predestination, and the name of an Englishman, I was under no alarm on the score of being accused of accelerating his death by my treatment. \" It would have been all the same,\" said Ameer Khan, \"had the first doctor in Hindustan been here ; it was his fate, and God so willed it, and nothing would have saved him.

Mahomed has made use of the doctrine for the spreading of his own opinions ; and has neutralized all the revolting and disagree- able part of it, by allowing his followers a life of sensuality, and the prospect of a heaven, than which the warmest imagination cannot paint one more likely to attract converts. I look upon a Mussulman, who fully believes that he is predestinated to a place in the Prophet's paradise, as rather an enviable person than otherwise. ii"], [126, "THE LOHANl'S GRAVE CHAPTER IV.

Whilst we were nearer the plains, the boys used to catch a fish, which I believe to be the Mahasir of the Indian waters ; but to-day I saw them catch another kind of fish, such as is found in Kashmir and in all the streams on the south side of the Himalaya. It is described in the Journal of Asiatic Society of Bengal, for January 1835, p. 39. The fish I allude to is certainly not a trout, as it has a valved mouth. A species of cicada was swarming upon every scanty leaf and blade of grass. These insects were eagerly seized by the pedes trians ; first spitted, then roasted, and afterwards eaten in scores.

The rear kafila came up with us on the eleventh, when we passed some barley fields and a small fort constructed by Barbuk Khan, Zemindar, or chief of the soil in these parts. From this place, part of the caravan took the road to Kandahar westward, which they expected to reach in ten days. We followed up the stream to the north, and encamped about three miles beyond the fort. A large town called Urghun, filled with iron-manufactories, and subjected to Dost Mahomed Khan, lay about two marches to the north-west of us. The inhabitants of this part of the country are called Karati.

The air was perfumed with aromatic plants. A few trees were scattered here and there, chiefly wild-olives and mountain-ash. Such was the scenery on the ascent. A delicious breeze was blowing from the north, when a Patan gallopped by me, exclaiming \"Khorassan! Khorassan!\" and adding, \" Sahib ! Sahib ! a breath of this would be worth a lak of rupees in Hindustan.\" I quite agreed with him. We then saw the last of the Gomul river, a mere streamlet. I passed over the summit ofthe hill, and drank, delighted, of the stream that flowed downwards to the west. \" Khorassan !

Kandahar lay west by south, and the Tukt i-Suliman and Derabund lay to the south east. It seemed as if a day's march were sufficient to bring us to the plain of Ghuz ni ; and beyond it numerous low ranges of hills conducted the eye to the western horizon.

The Lohanis gave chase ; and the robbers escaped, leav ing the animals to be taken possession of by their owners. A tribe called the Suliman Kyi occu- pied the district which we were entering, which ranges from north to south on the Ghuzni side of the pass. There are said to be about twelve thousand of them, nearly all thieves, but not so blood- thirsty or formidable as the Vuziris of the mountains near Derabund. They will not kill a man in cool blood without reason ; and their attacks rather resemble those made by the nightly prowlers of India, who creep into your house or tent, and steal a ring from your finger, or take a sheet from under you, without waking you. Some of the Suliman Kyi confessed"], [134, "106 THE SULIMAN KYL. to a Lohani whom they knew, that they were prowling about my tent all night, but that the watchmen were too much on the alert ; adding, that they thought it merito rius to rob a Feringi ; and that to have killed me an infidel, if necessary, would have been a sure passport to heaven. They will combine together to resist any thing like a serious invasion. Fourteen years ago, Jumar Khan, a Durani of rank, was sent from Kabul by Azim Khan, having four thousand men, and two cannon, with instructions to reduce a fort belonging to Taj Khan, one of their refractory chiefs; but the Suliman Kyi attacked him in the night with superior numbers, and succeed ed in killing or dispersing the whole of his force ; he himself losing his life in the action. The Suliman Kyi were in posses sion, I was told, of a million of sheep, and they paid a yearly tribute of one camel,"], [135, "107 SULIMAN KYL TRAFFIC. for every forty men, to Dost Mahomed Khan. Their country extends from north to south, for seven or eight caravan-marches, between Ghuzni and Kandahar, and for two or three from east to west. Once a year, in the winter season, they send a kafila of three or four hundred camels into the plains of Derabund, and Dhera Ismael Khan. They are chiefly laden Avith mad der-roots ; and with the produce of this, they purchase a sufficient quantity of the coarse cloths of the Punjab, as a supply for the whole of their tribe. They remain about twenty days in the plains, and then retire to their country by the same route. The Ruwash of Kabul is common on this side of the hill; several leaves of it were brought to me. The next morning we descended gently towards the west, and encamped on a"], [136, "108 ENCAMP AT KATAWAZ. sloping plain at a place called Shintzah. A mud fort belonging to a Zemindar was seen in the distance to the west ; and on the fourteenth, we pitched at Katawaz, on the plains of the Suliman Kyi. Between the Sir-i-koh, or summit of the pass, which we had left some days back, and the Dsharah ridge, which we were approaching, there might be a distance of from twenty to twenty-five miles. Here and there was a little wheat, which I was assured had been in the ground nearly a twelvemonth already, as it had been sown before the first snow fell in the preceding year. The plain in general was covered with sand, and glittering with in numerable and most minute particles of crystal ; and here and there were patches of wild-thyme, which imparted a delicious fragrance to the air.

Altogether, in the country around, there was much that re minded me of Persia ; the cool air, scented with artemisia or wormwood, and wild thyme; the walled gardens of mulberry and apricot trees; the long Kanaats or covered water-courses, and the gurgling cry of the bovra korra (black breast), or large sand grouse, which we frequently disturbed. These birds afforded me good sport, to the delight of the Lohanis, many of whom had never seen any thing killed with shot before. In Poshtu, the birds are termed the Tuturuk, which name well expresses their call.

Ameer Khan would not allow me to have my tent pitched, and I lay the whole day under an old pall, that had been torn by the donkeys and camels running against the ropes. Many of the Suliman Kyi passed around my tent, looking exceedingly inqui sitive, and exclaiming at first that my pack ages were filled with rupees ; however, I escaped with apparently little notice, and the payment of a very small sum. On the sixteenth of June, we marched 12"], [140, "112 ASPECT OF THE SOIL. on the Dsharah hills, which were open, gently undulating, and covered with soil.

The plain into which we descended, on the seventeenth, extended to the foot of the Narawah mountains, which lay before us. On the north-west, I should think, that the hill over which we had just passed was, if my thermometer can be trusted, a few hundred feet lower than the Sir-i-koh.

On the morning of the nineteenth of June, the caravan might be seen dividing, each party making for a separate village or fort, with the intention of remaining there a few days, weeks, or even months, according to the time required for the sale of their merchandise to the wild inhabitants of the numerous forts on the plain, and the still wilder Hazarah tribes, who descend from the snowy range of the Narawah mountains, for the purpose of traffic. These people are said to affirm that they, and the Ghorkas of Nipal, are descended from one stock : a few of them T"], [142, "114 AMEER KHAN'S KILLAH. visited our encampment, and their features did not belie their assertion. They, as well as the Undas or natives of the coun try, were clad with coats made of sheep skins.

I afterwards saw many of them, and found that a large proportion of the population of Ghuzni were Hazarahs. We had now arrived at what Ameer Khan called his killah, or castle : it was merely a collection of low mud walls, with out a single roof; and along and against these they pitched their tents. I had been led to believe that the caravan itself would proceed to Ghuzni, and that I should see"], [143, "115 LOHANI DUPLICITY. that place in their company. I was much annoyed and surprised by Ameer Khan suddenly telling me that we should remain where we were for a few days, and then proceed to Kabul, without going to Ghuz ni. I felt the more hurt at this piece of duplicity on the part of the Lohanis, be cause I had enjoyed their protection, and had been on the best possible terms with them. It was quite evident, that kind as they had been, they were acting as all Mussulmen will, from interested motives ; though I by no means wish to say, that they were actuated by them alone ; as I repeat, that I received the greatest kind ness at their hands, and felt, and still do feel, grateful for their protection ; but it was necessary to see such a place as Ghuz ni. I had, some eight days before, sent forward a note to the Nawab, Jabar Khan, brother of Dost Mahomed Khan, whose son Abdul Ghias Khan had written to him i2"], [144, "116 ILLNESS. about me from Lodiana, so that I ex- pected a man to be sent to me from him. The Lohanis were now guilty of wilful mis- representation, and objected to my going to Ghuzni, telling me I should be robbed and plundered by the young Sirdar, a son of Dost Mahomed, who was then in com- mand ; that their caravan would march forward in three days, and in fact saying every thing they could think of to prevent my going. I was all this time lying unwell in my tent, having been fairly poisoned by the bad water I had drunk during the march. I was so ill, that I thought it ne- cessary to apply leeches to my chest. There were plenty in the ditches around, but I found, on the application of them, that they were utterly useless. Altogether I was glad, one day, to observe a Sewar or horseman riding into the camp, and making for my tent ; his name was Mortazu Khan ; he was an old servant of the Nawab's, and 12"], [145, "117 SET OUT FOR GHUZNI. the head of a Kuzzelbash family, that had the care of their master's camels, on an estate situated at Khargh, a long day's march in the Hazarah mountains.

My Lohani friends tried to talk him over ; but I rode forward to Ghuzni the next day. I left them in very bad health, and somewhat out of humour. The fact was, they wished to detain me, that I might go with them to Kabul.

In fact, we became the best friends afterwards at Kabul, and I did say all I could in their favour. Taking them altogether, I look upon the Lohanis as the most respectable of the Ma homedans, and the most worthy of the no tice and assistance of our countrymen. The Turkish gentleman is said to be a man of his word ; he must be an enviable exception ; but I otherwise solemnly believe there is not a Mahomedan, \u2014 Suni, or Shiah, \u2014 between Constantinople and Yarkund, who would hesitate to cheat a Feringi Frank, or Eu ropean, and who would not lie, and scheme, and try to deceive, when the temptation was worth his doing so, and the contemplated risks of detection were neither prominent, numerous, nor soon to be apprehended.

There were numerous"], [149, "London Published by Whittaker fc C?Aw Mim-.i L\u00abn\u00ab"], [150, ""], [151, "121 VICINITY OF GHUZNI. villages, and mud forts standing near every one of them ; the glaring sameness of the walls more than relieved by the brilliant green foliage of the fruit-trees that were waving over them. The scented sunjyt, \u2014 unknown in India, rare in Kashmir, and common in Persia and Little Tibet, \u2014 was growing plentifully amongst the willows on the stream side; and the magpie and the white clover of England were joyfully re cognized as old acquaintances. There was much in the prospect to rally and enliven me ; and I stood much in need of it, having been a good deal reduced by fever during the preceding fortnight, and my illness had yet scarcely decreased. The Bala Hissar, or fort of Ghuzni, whose summit only was visi ble over the rise in the plain, soon came entirely in view. The minars, or pillars of Sultan Mahmud, rose majestically to the north of it, on the road to Kabul; and about two miles and a half further, in the"], [152, "122 THE BALA HISSAR. same direction, was seen the slope and village-hill of the Ruzeh-i-Sultan, or tomb of the great Mahmud. I believe I may affirm that there is little else to be seen in Ghuzni. The walls of the fort, in the centre of which stands the Bala Hissar, form an irregular pentagon, the sides varying from two to four hundred yards in length. On the west side they are elevated to a height of two hundred and eighty feet above the plain, and the rock might be scarped so as to render it thoroughly inaccessible on that side. The Afghans boast much of the strength of the walls and fortifications of Ghuzni. I thought there were too many towers along them ; but these defences, however formidable, would have been of little use in withstanding a regular siege, as I thought (and I am speaking with the greatest deference) that the city could be shelled in some places with tremendous effect from the neighbouring hill I shall"], [153, "123 ATTEMPT TO ENTER THE FORT. hereafter mention ; and on which, when I was there, there was no outwork or forti fication of any kind whatever. The fortifi cations were, no doubt, much strengthened by Dost Mahomed Khan, before the arri val of the British force. There are three gates to Ghuzni. One morning I rode into the fort through the Kabul gate : the guards were very civil, but stopped me, saying that it was necessary to have the young Nawab Taj Mahomed Khan's permission. He was outside the city, looking at some cavalry : I turned my horse's head, having merely seen that there was a large open space between the gate and the Bala Hissar. \" Kabul is nothing, then !\" exclaimed old Mortazu Khan, \" and Ghuzni is a great city !

His mother was a slave-girl in the Zunana of Poyndur Khan ; his father gave her in marriage to a water carrier, but still continued his attentions to her. By the custom of these countries, a servant marrying a slave becomes also a slave.

He was ejected, before a year had elapsed, by the victorious Sikhs. He subsequently received the government of the Ghilzyes, producing an annual revenue of ninety thousand ru pees ; but was deprived of it by Abib-Ullah, Mahomed Azim's son. Dost Mahomed Khan and the Nawab united, and drove Abib-Ullah out of Kabul.

He did this simply that his brother might not be able to laugh at him. The letters were intercepted, and coolly put into his hands by his brother, Dost Mahomed Khan ; who, after he had taken the country, one evening, in the presence of his officers, kissed the muzzle of his guns, remarking that they were better than brothers to him.

Shady orchards, and meadows, made verdant by artificial streams, directed so as to water them, were seen on each side ofthe road. Prosperous villages were on every hand, composed of square-topped mud-houses, surrounded by small patches of cultivated land, divided by rows of poplar, sunjit or willow. The crops appeared to have been produced by the united labours of the agriculturist and the market-gardener.

The Na wab's house itself \u2014 which I was afterwards allowed to see \u2014 was built precisely in the same manner, but much larger, handsomer, and cleaner. The doors, I observed, were generally so low, that a man \u2014 even of ordi nary stature \u2014 could not enter them without stooping. This seems to be the case gene rally throughout the East. The houses are made so principally, I suspect, with a view to the advantage of resistance, in case of a forcible entry being attempted. Let the reader conceive a broken succes sion of houses, composed of mud walls of different elevations, pierced here and there with wooden pipes to carry off the rain from the flat roofs, which it would otherwise in jure ; then let him imagine a few square low doors, opening under the eaves of the first story, projecting over a sort of trottoir,"], [191, "159 BUILDINGS IN KABUL. formed by the wearing away of the middle of a road, so irregular that no wheel carriage could be driven along safely ; now and then a larger door interposing, \u2014 the entrance to the residence of some great man, \u2014 with a mulberry- tree occasionally peering over the wall ; add to this a thick crowd, and he will form a good idea of a Kabul street. The Bala Hissar or fort, the beautiful little white marble mosque near Baber's tomb, and the great bazaar, are the only buildings worth notice in Ka bul. The profusion and display in the bazaar is perhaps nowhere else exceeded ; though I do not think the bazaar equals some in Persia, \u2014 that of Shiraz, for instance.

I could only turn my horse with the greatest difficulty, and motioned to the driver to go back.

Kabul may be described as lying at the foot of a range of hills, whose direction is from north-west to south-east. The country is thus divided into the \" plain of Kabul,\" and the \" Chahar Deh,\" or four villages. The city is built directly under a rocky hill of gneiss, that rises a thousand feet above it, and bends round it from the south-east to the south-west ; where, with the dip of another hill opposite, is formed the Pass which leads into Chahar Deh, one hundred and fifty yards broad. Through this pass part ofthe British army entered Kabul.

After winding round the mountains which bound Chahar Deh to the north-west, it waters the plain itself, and reaches Kabul by the pass between the city and Asha Mahi (mother Eve). The water near the city is not recommended ; and all who can afford it send for water to a small stream, which runs from the mountains of Pughman, and is converted to the purposes of husbandry. The whole of the north part of the plain of Kabul is irrigated by the water of the river ; but the Logur or Mydan stream rises, I believe, near the copper-mine which I vi sited on my road from Ghuzni, passes from Mydan to Logur, and over the plain to the south of Chahar Deh ; then waters the south-eastern part of the plain of Kabul, and is joined by the Kabul river below the gap in the mountains, close to, and to the north of, the Peshawur-road, a distance of fifteen miles from the city.

Close to the Bala Hissar are the ruins of the Mosque called Musjid-i-shah ; otherwise the Bala Hissar differs nothing in appearance from the rest of the town. I agree with Lieutenant Burnes in esti mating the population of Kabul at about sixty thousand. It is made up of Afghans, Kuzzelbashes, Tajiks, and Hazaras. Hin dus are very few in number, and are chiefly money-lenders. There were about two hundred houses of Hindus at Bokhara. The Ameer of that place ordered the Hindus to bury, and not burn, their dead ; which had the effect of making them leave the city.

Moollah Khoda Dad, a person learned in the history of his countrymen, read to me, from the Mujma-ul-Unsab (collection of genealogies), the following short account of their origin. They say, that the eldest of Jacob's sons was Judah, whose eldest son was Osruk, who was the father of Oknur, the father of Moalib, the father of Farlai, the father of Kys, the father of Talut, the father of Ermiah, the father of Afghana, whence the name of Afghans. He was cotemporary with Nebuchadnezzar, called himself Bin-i-Israel, and had forty sons, whose names there is no occasion to insert. His thirty-fourth descendant, in a direct line, after a period of two thousand years, was Kys. From Kys, who lived in the time of the prophet Mahomed, there have been sixty-six generations.

The population of Kandahar is Afghan ; in Kabul there are perhaps eighteen or twenty thousand Kuzzelbashes. Their his tory has been often written. When Nadir Shah marched towards Delhi, he had twelve twelve thousand fighting Kuzzelbashes with him. When he quitted that city, on his return, he left behind him three hundred of these, who, with other troops, were directed to bring away his treasure, and follow him.

The Ghorkas, however, are Hindus; whilst the Hazaras are Shiah Ma homedans. This country is supposed to have been visited by the prophet Ali. There is a bunde, or water-dam, in the mountains near Ghuzni, said to have been miraculously placed there by him. There is also, in the same neighbourhood, a huge rock on the plain to the eastward, thrown by him, they say, from the top of the Sir-i- Koh mountains.

They prepare a coarse warm cloth from their wool, and find a ready sale in the plains for their cheese and ghee ; the latter, it is well known, forming an indispensable requi site in the kitchen of every oriental, rich or poor. In their elevated valleys they culti vate wheat, barley, and rice. They have a species of wheat called, from its shape, dundan-i-shutur, or \" camel's tooth.\" I regret very much that I did not know the existence of this grain until I had gone one march from Kabul on my return. It is nearly twice the size of the ordinary grain, if I were to judge of it by the few specimens that were put into my hand. The religious customs of the Hazaras are, of course, the same as those of Shiah Mahomedans. Their games are manly and athletic ; they ride, wrestle, and shoot at a mark.

The Hazaras have a yodeln, like the Swiss. I frequently heard it in passing through the country. The immediate environs of Kabul have pretensions to as much beauty as most places that owe their improvement entirely to the hand of man. I am sure that there are not ten trees in the country that have not been planted ; and I do not remember to have seen one that could be called a large tree of its species. The hills around are bare and rocky ; the plain, by nature, is almost equally barren.

I have no where seen such an abundance of fruit. Of grapes, there are four or five different kinds ; but I think that the husseini, a long grape, which is sent to India in cotton, in flat, circular boxes, is the only one that will bear com petition with those of the south of Europe. The red melon is not better than our own ; the white is sweet and delicious, but infe rior, as I was told, to those of Bokhara, and I thought to some I had eaten in Little Tibet. The common apple much resembles the English red-streak ; but they have a winter fruit which is far superior to it. The pear of Samarkand is excellent, very crisp and juicy, but still capable of great improvement. The European mulberry is called here the Shah tut, or king-mulberry, on account of its superiority to the insipid red and white fruit, so common all over the east. The peaches, apricots, plums,"], [207, "173 INTRODUCTION OF POTATOES. and cherries, are inferior to those of Eng land. The pomegranates of Kandahar are the finest in the world, and their flavour is most delicious and refreshing. Currants, gooseberries, strawberries, oranges, and nectarines, are not known in the gardens of Kabul. Walnuts are plentiful. The Ruwash, or wild rhubarb root, I found to be too acid to be eaten without sugar ; it makes a good preserve, and when well se lected, forms an excellent ingredient in a curry. With a profusion of fruit on my breakfast-table every morning, I arrived at two very serious conclusions ; one was, that I was sooner tired of any kind than of cherries ; and the other was, that a fine mazagon mango was a finer fruit than a good peach.

They have cabbage, lettuce, turnips, carrots, onions, leeks, cucumbers, gourds, beans, peas, endive, celery, and cauliflowers. These are generally cultivated in the fields, the gardens being reserved for fruit and flowers. The system of irrigation prevails every where. The fields are divided by a ditch of running water ; and on one side, perhaps on both, is a row of mulberries, willows, sunjits, or poplars. A patch of ground, contained in four sides of sixty short spaces each, is called a Jaryd ; and in the same field is seen as many different crops as there are Jaryds, separated either by a water-course, or a small ridge of earth."], [209, "175 AFGHAN CUSTOMS.

I had refused it to him several times, because the man himself had asked for it in full durbar, and rather too familiarly for so short an acquaintance ; but as he was known to be capable of any thing, as well as of instigating a robbery on the high way, the good Nawab thought it as well that he should be pacified. As the state of the country prevented my going, I may have some excuse for not hazarding much conjecture on the antiquities that are found there.

Even at a later period, we have the evidence of Chinese writers, who, speaking of the people of Fan-yan-na, \u2014 i. e.

They are, in fact, too numerous and too extensive to be regarded as, exclusively, either catacombs, or monastic cells, although they may have been occasionally so employed. \" Of the sculptures at Bamian little question need be entertained ; they are manifestly Buddhist, in the costume and attitude in which Sakya is not unfre-"], [222, "188 BAMIAN. \" quently represented when in an erect \" position.

We find there the successive vestiges of Greek, Scythian, and Sassanian rule, and of the Buddhist and Mithraic forms of worship.

Mr. Masson informed me, that the Parapamisan range is a good deal broken into mountains, with table-land on their summits. Bamian, al though in a valley, might have received its name as the capital city ofthe Pahar-i-Bam, or Pam; but this is mere conjecture. I would derive the word \" pamir \" from the same root. The return of Alexander to a city he had founded amongst the Parapamis\u00e6, is the best proof we have of his having originally crossed into Bactria, either by the pass of Bamian, or by that of the Hindu Kosh. As he came from the west, it is probable that he would choose that of Bamian, being the easiest, and the first he would meet with. But the learned Professor observes, \" we may conclude, either that he did not go there, or did not find a city there.\" I"], [231, "197 ALEXANDRIA AD CAUCASUM. I should venture, with all deference, to think that Bamian, situated as it is and was, never could be without dwellings of some kind ; and, although they might be so insignificant as not to attract the notice of Alexander, yet that the situation would not be overlooked by him. The first notice of Alexandria ad Caucasum is, that he went to the Caucasus, and built a city there.

Beghram is certainly not in the Parapami sus, which Bamian is ; and if we are to pay attention to the hints of Eratosthenes, as related by Arrian, we should infer that the Macedonian soldiers, in their speeches, called the Parapamisus the Caucasus, by way of flattering Alexander. I am much inclined to think that the pretensions of Bamian to be the Alexandria ad Caucasum are far from being without foundation ; and in that case, Alexander must have both gone and returned by way of Bamian ; or, after having crossed over the Hindu Kosh, may have returned as far as Bamian, in order to visit his lately-founded city.

Mr. Masson told me that he attributed the number of coins, in a great measure, to the ancient custom of putting a piece of money under the tongue of a corpse.

The country around Kabul may be described as an extended plain, surrounded by bare mountains and hills of different elevation, broken into passes, up which the plain is extended. Across the great plain, as an axis from north to south, runs another chain of hills, of the same character as those around it. The Tukt-i-Shah is the highest part.

Its principal boundary is the mountains : on the south east are the plains of Logur, and the open passes in the same direction. The Kabul river runs through the gap at the south ern end of the ridge ; and after traversing the plain, across which lies the road to Pe shawur, is joined by the stream from Cha har Deh, which flows through the gap under the hill of Asha-mahi, and enters the mountains of Lughman, on its way to Attok.

I arrived there with my camels, by Sokta Chenar, in three days; the road generally good, but in places the rugged precipices meet so nearly that a"], [263, "229 REACH BARIK AB. gun-carriage could not pass. By the Khord Kabul road it occupies four days for camels. There guns cannot go, at least so I was informed. Horses can go by the Lulah Bund road, but not camels. Guns coming from Kabul to Peshawur arrive by Kohat. Sei Baba, a fakir's dwelling, is a regular nest of thieves ; but the near presence of Mahomed Akber Khan, who was engaged in subjugating the valley of Taghau, which he effected after being twice defeated by the mountaineers, was a sufficient protection for me, and we passed unmolested. After his second defeat he had sent fifteen heads into Kabul. He had blown a robber-chief from a gun. \" Why don't he rather march against the infidel Sikhs ?\" said a thief who came to look at us, but dared do nothing more. We halted at a place called Barik Ab, a regular resting-place for travellers ; there"], [264, "230 JEG DELIK. are caves hollowed in the bank for their accommodation. From the hills around there was a very extensive view of the country, in the direction of the Hindu Kosh, including the valley of Taghau, which appeared, from such a distance, to be nearly barren. Jeg Delik was the next stage. A sort of police was established there, who resided in cottages amongst the hills, which were covered with holly-bushes. The next day, October twenty-fifth, we passed a long red bridge, built by the Che guthai, or Moguls, over the Surk Ab, a stream which emerges from a defile, and flows away to its junction with the Kabul river near the plains of Jelalabad. The whole formation here appeared to be of schist overlaid with sand and sand-stone.

The next day we arrived at the Nawab's castle at Tatung, near the foot of the moun tain to the west of Jelalabad, where the steward had received orders to provide me with every thing. There is an excellent garden attached to it, in which the fruits and flowers of Afghanistan were mingled with those of India : the oranges and lemons of the Punjab were growing beside the pomegranates, grapes, and other European fruits of Kandahar. The situation of Jela labad, which is a small plain, surrounded by a square wall, and containing five or six hundred houses, separated by a range of mountains on either side, preserved it generally from the chilling blasts of the western Caucasus, and the parching heat of India. A great quantity of sugar-cane is"], [266, "232 THE SUFYD KOH. grown there. In the centre of the plain stands the town itself. If Jelalabad be the Nysa of Arrian, as it most likely is, I should certainly think that the Sufyd Koh, or \" white mountain,\" was Mount Meros. There is but little verdure on the other mountains around ; and I have no doubt that ivy, perhaps laurel, and cer tainly rhododendron, might be found there. Ivy is plentiful about the old buildings in Kashmir, and, I believe, upon hills of the same elevation as the valley. The majestic and isolated appearance of the Sufyd Koh, independently of its skirts being partially covered with jungle, would undoubtedly, I should think, attract to itself attention, as a locale on which a tradition might be founded. The Sufyd Koh, or \" white mountain,\" forms a most majestic boundary to the"], [267, "233 MOUNTAIN FRUIT. southern side of the plain, at a distance of about fifteen or twenty miles from the town. Its height, at a guess, is about seventeen thousand feet ; and, along the whole southern side of the Himalaya, from the Hindu Kosh to Nipal, the Sufyd Koh is, I believe, the only detached mountain which can vie in altitude with the more con nected peaks of that stupendous Cordillera. I regret that a want of time prevented me from visiting it. The productions of this mountain are said to be numerous. I can answer for the goodness of its pomegranates, which are of the same kind as those of Kandahar ; and for the large size, rather than the flavour, of its Kuttah grapes. Most of the fruits of Kabul are cultivated on its rugged declivities ; and all the wild animals that haunt the neighbouring moun tains, near and distant, are numerous in its recesses.

The snowy top of the Sufyd Koh is visi ble from Peshawur ; but it cannot be seen from Kabul, even from the top of the Tukt-i-Shah, which rises behind it. I regretted still more that I could not go to a village situated on the borders of Kaf firistan, a long day's march from Jelalabad, where savage-looking mountains elevate themselves to the north. The good Nawab had made arrangements for me to go there, if I wished. I forget its name ; but it is well known, as being inhabited both by Mussulmen and Kaffirs, who act as the sen tinels or out- pickets of two opposing armies, to prevent invasion from either party. No persons but the venders of salt and itinerant workers of golden ornaments are allowed by the Kaffirs to enter their country. Kaffiristan commences from the moun tains beyond the valley of Nijrau, to the 12"], [269, "235 THE KAFFIRS. north of Kabul, and extends behind those of Taghau and Lughman to the frontiers of Bajawur. To the north it is bounded by Badukshan ; and it forms the greater part of one side of the valley of Chitral, or Little Kashghar. The Kaffirs are on good terms with the Chitralis, and occasionally mix with them. My authority is the grand son of the exiled Rajah of Chitral, who was driven out by the present ruler, Shah Ka tore. I saw him in Little Tibet. The Mussulmen regard the Kaffirs, according to the name they give them, as infidels ; the Kaffirs, on the other hand, detest the Mussulmen. The feuds between them are constant, and there are persons killed every year in Lughman. Such is the animosity that exists towards the Mussulmen there, that when a return from a foray is expected, the young Kaffir girls put walnuts and dried fruits into their bosoms, and advance to meet the men returning, who flourish their long"], [270, "236 SINGULAR CUSTOMS. knives, with the heads of their victims upon the points. Those who have killed a Mus sulman have then a right to snatch the walnuts and fruits from the girls' bosoms. When a cow is to be eaten at a feast, those who have not been blooded by the death of a Mussulman have their food handed to them over the carver's shoulder, and are pelted with cow-dung by the women. This almost unknown race say that they are Arabs, and are descended from the same tribe as Mahomed. I should think it much more likely that they are descended from the Greeks of the Bactrian dynasty. I saw three Kaffir slaves ; one of them at Kabul, and another at Jelalabad. They had grey eyes, light brown hair, and a complexion that would have been considered fair in Europe ; and their manner was very dif ferent from that of either Sikh, Hindu, or Afghan. One I saw at Kabul was a young man, about eighteen, who said he was the"], [271, "237 KAFFIR CHIEF. son of a Malek or chief among his country men.

There was a natural free dom and elegance in his manners ; and in that of a second particularly, who was the youngest, and whose action, when he wished to speak, but was unable to express himself, was worthy the study of a sculptor. They were learning to read and write Persian ; and their abilities were said to be extraordinary. The youngest of all, a little boy, was caught by the Mussulmen whilst tending sheep ; and, at the command of his master, he showed me how his captors suddenly put one hand over his mouth, and the other over his eyes, when he was made a prisoner.

With the assistance of the eldest of these Kaffirs I was able to form a vocabulary, which ap pears in the appendix, and bears but little resemblance to Greek. The houses in which the Kaffirs dwell are some of them three or four stories high. From what I could collect, many of their occupants were accounted rich amongst them; and not without reason. Their flocks and herds are very large ; and the golden ornaments of the women are far from valueless. I was told that they rarely inhabit the valleys, but that all their dwell ings were placed on the mountain side, with a regard to the vantage-ground in case of attack, and a distant view of foreign inva sion. The poorest of them drink wine, made in the country ; and their fondness for the liquor is shared by many of the"], [273, "239 WINE OF THE COUNTRY. inhabitants of the valleys on the north-east of them. The Gilghitees, for instance, drink wine in abundance. I have tasted it ; it was not bad, but required clarifying. Whilst their drinking-vessels would assimilate them to the Greeks, their exposure of the dead rather bespeaks for them a descent from the Guebers of Persia ; and they themselves say that their forefathers were Arabs. I have no remark to make upon the nu merous places which, according to Arrian, Alexander met with and took in his march from Nic\u00e6a to the Attok ; excepting, that as elephants and a large breed of cattle are mentioned, they must certainly, with the exception of Aornos, have been in the plains.

Saadut Khan sent me word that he waived his share, but that the tribe must have theirs, and would take no denial. I arrived at Peshawur on the third of November, 1836. Saadut Khan's servant attended me over the Kabul river, and did not return till he said that he dared go no further on account of the Sikhs. I called upon Shere Sing, the eldest adopted son of Runjit, who was encamped near the place, and presented him with a handsome telescope, which I had intended for Murad Beg of Kunduz, and which only arrived as I was entering Peshawur. I got in return, by way of compliment, a guard of twelve horsemen as far as Attok.

In my way thither I visited Torbela, where the Maharajah Runjit Sing once forded the river on an elephant, having first propitiated the river-gods, so I was in formed, by turning a live elephant into the stream to take his chance. My Sikh in formants would have me believe that there was no ford previously ; but that the Maha rajah, being a Khoda-Dad, or \" God-given,\" he alone was enabled to find the ford.

The Gurus, or priests, w7ere also allowed"], [279, "245 THE GURUNTH. to sit on chairs in the Durbar. The Gu runth, being the sacred book of the Sikhs, is allowed a guard of honour; and, when talking to a Guru, it is the etiquette to inquire after the health of the Gurunth Sahib ; which would be paralleled, in En glish, by an inquiry after the health of \u2014 Bible, Esq. When Runjit was encamped away from his capital, and the Gurunth was expected to arrive on a subsequent day, he would ride out to meet it, and dismount, and salaam to it, with the greatest reve rence, \u2014 so I was informed ; but I never had the good fortune to witness the incident. Runjit, however, was never remarkable for a very conscientious or practical observance of any of those great truths upon which all real religion must be based. He knew, as all great rulers have known, the advantage of a national religion, and a show of respect for its ordinances ; but I much doubt if he cared for it at heart ; whilst the quantum"], [280, "246 VENERATION FOR THE COW. of superstition was, as is usually the case, inversely to that of the real religion he possessed. The cow is venerated by the Sikhs, even more than by the Hindus.

When I quitted the Punjab, Runjit was also availing himself of the able, but ill- requited, services of the following officers : Captains Ford, Foulkes, Steinbach, De la Font, De la Roche, and Van Cortlandt. The most powerful of the Sirdars were the three brothers, Rajah Gulab Sing, of Jumu ; Rajah Dhihan Sing, of Bhimbur ; and Rajah Sucheyt Sing, of Ramnagur : three towns in the lower range of the Pun jabi Himalaya.

His handsome appearance \u2014 his skill in martial exercises \u2014 and his address in the hunting-field, procured him the especial favour of Runjit ; who eventually created him the Rajah Rajghan, or Rajah of Rajahs ; and he was always called, par excellence, \" Rajah Sahib,\" or \" the Rajah.\" Up to the time of his master's death he was his prime minister of the Punjab. He filled his office w7ith ability and distinction ; and, perhaps, notwithstanding his faults, and a studied, but dignified, insolence of demea nour, he was one of the best men, and the finest fellow, in the Punjab; which is not, however, saying much for him. He really was attached to Runjit ; but his pre tended attempt to throw himself upon his funeral pyre, was nothing but a masterly piece of humbug.

He acted as interpreter for us.

We both bowed ; and, ac cording to custom, passed a bag of rupees around his head, to keep off, as it is said, the evil eye, or evil spirits, and then pre sented it to him. He shook hands with us, requested us to sit down, and immediately commenced a conversation with Baron Hu gel. Hera Sing was seated in a gilt chair on his right, and a few more of the Sirdars were either sitting or standing around us. His questions were short and comprehen sive, and related chiefly to military subjects, \u2014 what service the Baron had seen, whether he thought cavalry or infantry the strongest arm, adding that his French officers told him that their squares would beat off all his"], [293, "259 INTERVIEW WITH RUNJIT. cavalry, \u2014 whether he w7as related to the royal family of Austria. He then turned to me, asked me a few questions about my travels, and whether I knew any thing of military discipline ; and, as I answered him at once in the negative, he seemed careless about further inquiry, and we soon took leave of him. The next morning the fakir was again sent to put questions to the Baron, \u2014 \" How would he act if he had but a handful of troops to oppose to a more nu merous force ?\" to which he answered, \" that it would be necessary to concentrate them, and be more active and vigilant in propor tion to his inferiority.\" The fakir smiled at this, as he knew it would please his master. \"And which of the European armies do you think the best disciplined ?\" \" The English,\" was the flattering reply ; and the old minister smiled again, with still greater satisfaction, and then summed up his que ries with what both he and his master no s 2"], [294, "260 INTERVIEW WITH RUNJIT. doubt considered to be the very climax of compliment, \u2014 which was a request from Runjit, that the Baron would give him a little of the very same medicine which he took himself. As there was no help for it, I went out of the room, and returned with my bottle of calomel, and handed it to the fakir, with many remarks on its strength, cautionary, but useless, as there was not the smallest chance of Runjit's touching a sin gle grain of it. Every morning brought with it some new display, and an invitation from Runjit. His Sepahis, in chain armour, were exhibited; his picked matchlock-men fired at a brass tota, or waterpot, and worse shots I never saw. He then requested the Baron to point a gun at a tree, as a mark ; and was pleased to see it shivered by the third shot. At one of these interviews Runjit took"], [295, "the Maharajah's queries. 261 my hand at parting, and asked me \"if I thought I could manage a country ?\" I said, \" that I believed I could ;\" but, know- ing what was coming, I could not help smiling.

The fact is, that he tried to humbug almost every European he saw into the idea that he would make him governor of Kashmir ; whereas, in truth, he would as soon have had the devil for his viceroy in that fine province, and was far too apprehensive of a strike for independence, to entrust its government to an Englishman.

The sky was cloudless ; the sun most bril liant, but not oppressive.

I should say, that whilst many rulers have been more ambitious of repu tation, few have been more anxious for increase of dominion, than the late Maha rajah. A man may be proud of a costly gar ment, though its weight may be oppressive to him ; and Runjit has always been proud of his alliance with the company, though it has always imposed a positive, or indirect, restraint upon his movements. It is not likely, that he should regard the British with any warmer feeling than that of admi ration, excited by the superiority which he"], [303, "269 MODE of getting money. would vainly hope to attain ; and though he may in many instances have evinced a kind esteem for different individuals, yet, on the other hand, his behaviour towards any Englishman, not a Company's servant, who may have crossed the Sutlij with the intention of asking for service, is widely re moved from cordiality towards the nation in general. His tyrannical delay of deci sion, and subsequent withholding of ar rears of pay, had to my own knowledge in several instances amounted to cruelty. Runjit caused great misery by similar delay, but he was never fond of shedding blood, while of cunning, he always evin ced a sufficient share. M.

Upon one occasion he said he was drowsy without knowing why, sat himself down in a chair, and pretended to sleep for more than half an hour.

He at last said, that he had dreamed that he had no money to pay his troops, and he had prayed to the Guru, who had appeared to him, and told him to be of good cheer, that if he had no money his friends had, and that he could never remain in want whilst his father's ministers were near him.

He accordingly invited him to a friendly conference under a tent, of which the ropes had purposely been loosened. Runjit talk ed most amicably with him for some time, and then found some pretext for retiring, particularly requesting his guest to remain seated in the tent until his return. The in stant he was outside, he gave the signal, and the ropes being cut or unfastened, the tent dropped down upon his astonished friend, whilst Runjit was skipping about from one side to the other, and vowing vengeance upon them, should their carelessness allow such a villain to escape.

Her brother, or pretended brother, was a sword-grinder in Lahore, and he was quickly promoted to all honor. He rode upon an elephant, and was attended by a guard. He became far too great a man to look down upon the street before him, and soon ran his elephant over a fakir of great sanctity, who died in consequence of the injuries he received. Runjit, however, cared for none of these things, so long as he enjoyed himself; but in order to force him to take notice of what had passed, the fakir's brethren placed a building to his memory, on one of the highest mounds amongst the ruins at Lahore, in order that Runjit might see it whenever he rode that way. This had the desired effect ; Runjit appeased the fakirs, by dismissing the girl, having, it is probable become tired of her company ; and the sword grinder was disgraced at the same time."], [307, "DANCING-GIRL'S TRICK. 273 I am not sure, whether it was the same or another favourite dancing-girl, who one day tied his hands together, most likely at his own request, she thinking it, no doubt, an excellent joke to have done so. Runjit then sent in a hurry for two of his Sirdars, Rajah Dhihan Sing, and Kosheal Sing, the Jemadar or chief captain ; who rapidly obeyed the summons, thinking that busi ness of importance was to be discussed, and feigned the greatest horror at seeing their master with his hands tied. Runjit then asked them, what punishment ought to be inflicted upon the person, who had dared to tie his hands ? A heavy fine ! was the reply ; and Runjit made the girl refund to him several thousand of his rupees for her temerity ; all of which, and more with them, she was quite sure of receiving again after wards ; and Runjit then got fifty thousand rupees apiece from his two Sirdars, for the honour of untying him.

No !\" he said, \" I am an old man.

Had I been obsequious enough to have given Runjit two eyes, he would probably have made no objection ; and when he did sit to me, he was con stantly turning away, so as to conceal his blind side.

It would be absurd and illiberal not to make allowances for the want of education ; but otherwise, I should say, that taken as a body, the Sikh Sirdars, of whom the durbar of Lahore was com posed, might generally, with some little exception, be designated as gentlemen blackguards, and \" something more,\" to whom a disregard of principle, subtle in trigue, and calm hypocrisy, were alike fa miliar and diurnal.

I do not believe them to be remarkable for personal courage. A year or two ago, General Ventura, nettled at something that had passed, told Runjit in full durbar, that his Sirdars were all cowards, or used words to that effect. They immediately rose in a fury and gathered round him, and Runjit himself, old and enfeebled, leaped from his chair in an un governable passion, called for his sword and shield, and told the General to draw"], [311, "277 SIR HENRY FANE ARRIVES. and defend himself; whilst Ventura, a sa breur of Wagram, looked round upon the gathered storm with a coolness that showed he did not expect a practical refutation of what he had just asserted ; and then both pacified and pleased the Maharajah by say ing that he was his servant, that his life was his if he wished for it, but that come what would, he would never draw his sword against his king and master. Sir Henry Fane, the commander-in-chief, crossed the Sutlij at Hurree-ke-Putun (the green ferry), on the 3rd of March, 1837. It was at a very early hour on a cold misty morning, that I repaired, in company with Captain Wade, whose guest I was, to the presence of Shere Sing, who with Lena Sing, a Sirdar of rank and family, and the most learned man in the Punjab, had been deputed by Runjit, to receive and attend"], [312, "278 SIKH NOTION OF PROWESS. upon his Excellency.

We were amused with this antediluvian idea of what a commander in-chief or his men ought to be.

After breakfast every one sallied forth to be present at the Malakat, or meeting. We again approached the garden, under a salute to the commander, from the Maha rajah's guns placed there. Numerous elephants in gorgeous trappings, present ing to the eye a moving confusion of cloth of gold, yellow, green, and crimson-colour ed silks, were shortly seen to issue from the portals of the Ram-Bagh.

Sir Henry received him with a cordial English shake of the hand, and was con ducted by Runjit to the tent prepared for his reception. Here there were nearly sixty elephants in attendance, drawn or disposed in different lines. After the usual compliments had passed on both sides, Runjit ordered his favourite horses to be exhibited: they were fine animals of their kind, and richly caparisoned, and pran ced, caracoled, and curvetted to admira tion, but seemed better fitted to draw a state 1 This apt quotation was sported upon the occasion by my friend M.

On the afternoon of the same day, the commander-in-chief was again invited to the residence of the young and royal bridegroom. The inter view w7as enlivened by the performances of the dancing girls. The Maharajah, and No Nehal Sing, who was half covered with a golden veil, were seated under a tree, load ed with artificial oranges.

On the eighth the camp moved to Atari, the residence of the bride's father ; whose castle, presenting a collection of flat roofs and square and windowless turrests, arose with some majesty on the left of the en campment. A grand procession was ar ranged for the afternoon. Artificial par terres, temples, towers, and whirligigs, were carried along with it. Music was playing, and cannon firing.

The Maharajah held his levee on a raised terrace, commanding a fine view of the plain. No Nehal Sing again wore his veil of gold, and the dancing-girls were again called into requisition. In the evening there was an exhibition of fireworks, the castle was splendidly illuminated, and Run jit conducted his guests along a broad way, lined with his troops, blazing with arti ficial light, and extending for several hun dred yards from the castle to the camp. On the ninth commenced the most ex traordinary part of the scene. In honour of his distinguished guest, Runjit had or dered a small rupee (about one shilling and sixpence) to be given to those who would receive it ; and, in order to prevent any one from asking for it a second time, he had"], [319, "285 BRIDEGROOM PRESENTS. directed a large space of ground to be en closed, whose circumference could not have been less than between two and three miles. There were eighty doorways or openings in the enclosure ; and, at each of them, was stationed an officer, to superintend the dis tribution of the money. There could not have been less than four laks, i. e. four hun dred thousand persons collected together ; and many of these were the venders of water, salt, flour, firewood, and other ne cessaries of life. In the three days that elapsed in liberating such a crowd, Runjit must have paid away upwards of thirty thousand pounds in this manner. The Commander-in-chief was then con ducted to view the presents made by the bride, or rather by her father, to the young and royal bridegroom. These consisted of eleven elephants, one hundred and one horses, with numerous camels, cows, and"], [320, "286 THE CAMP. buffaloes ; and the ingenuity of the Sikh artistes had been taxed to provide a fitting quantity of the most approved sweetmeats and confectionery. The space of not much less than an acre was nearly covered with female attire, and a brilliant display of the rich silks of Multan, and the golden and scarlet kimkab of Benares ; and on some ropes, that had been stretched across them, were suspended a large collection of the less gaudy, but more chastely-coloured, shawls from the unrivalled looms of Kashmir. The place allotted to the Commander in-chief's camp at Lahore was finely situ ated on the north of the city. It was, in fact, on the edge of the parade-ground. The north side of the camp was washed by the tranquil stream of the Ravi, four or five hundred yards in width.

The time at Lahore was occupied by a succession of visits, fetes, and reviews. On the fourteenth, the Commander-in-chief's escort was inspected. It consisted of a squadron of His Majesty's sixteenth lancers, under the command of Major Cuerton, and another of native lancers ; ten companies of infantry, and six pieces of horse-artillery, under the command of Captains Timbrel and Timings.

Rajah Dhihan Sing once went so far as to call him a \" woman \" to his face. This was, I think, when he was prevented from marching upon Sinde, in 1836-7 ; and when, as a punning friend remarked, he thought himself \" a 12"], [323, "289 runjit and the bhurtporeans. man more sinned against than sinning,\" in making his preparations.

The General replied, that he was his servant, and was ready to obey his orders ; but advised him to think again before he ran such a risk of losing the Punjab. When the Bhurtporeans found that their attempts at bribery, as de tailed in Captain Osborne's account, were unavailing, they sent him a woman's dress. A gun was purposely dismounted and set up again, in less than half a minute.

The fifteenth of March was the day appointed for the return visit of Runjit to the Commander-in-chief, in his Excel lency's tent. Rajah Dhihan Sing stood behind his master's chair. After the usual compliments, Runjit assured Sir Henry that he looked upon him in the same light as the Governor-general, and that between two such illustrious friends he drew no distinction. He asked his opinion as to the relative merits of the armies of the three Presidencies, and as to Sir Henry's early history as a soldier ; and added, that he himself, during a campaign, had fre quently divided his last bit of bread with his own Sepahis. Many of the officers present were then separately introduced to him."], [325, "291 THE EUROPEAN LADIES.

When the visit was over, Runjit, whose head reached up to Sir Henry Fane's waist, was conducted by him into an inner tent, where the presents, consisting of shawls, fire-arms, &c, were laid out for his inspec- u 2"], [326, "292 PRESENTS TO RUNJIT. tion.

Runjit, who was always fond of fun, and, moreover, would never let slip so fair an opportunity of testing the training of their horses, pur posely ran his elephants along the line, and within about afoot of their heads. A young horse regards an elephant with peculiar terror, as was exemplified by an artillery horse opposite to them, that reared, plunged, and struggled to extricate himself; but Fa bricius himself, aided by his reason, could not have displayed a more stoical indiffer ence, or remained more motionless, than the well-broken chargers ofthe lancers."], [327, "293 FEAR OF TREACHERY. In Prinsep's Life of Runjit Sing we read that he was scarcely able to dismiss from his mind the idea of treacherous behaviour towards him, on the part of Lord William Bentinck, at Rupur ; and that, in the mid dle of the night preceding his first interview with the Governor-general, he sent for Ge neral Allard, and was scarcely satisfied by his offer of staking his own life upon the safety of his master; and that the astrolo gers, after consulting the Gurunth, advised him to take with him a present of two apples, and to judge of the sincerity of his welcome by the manner in which they were received. Although experience and his own penetration may have secured him from fears of a similar nature upon the present occasion, yet it would appear that sus picions of foul play towards him were still rife in the minds of his attendants.

This man assured me, that he and his brethren had agreed amongst themselves, that, at the interview I have just described, they would force their way as far into the tent as possible, so as not to lose sight of their master for a moment; and that their fears for his safety had taken such a possession of their minds, that they had packed up, and even sent away, his most valuable effects, in order that, if they succeeded in the rescue, the wish to pre serve them might not induce him to linger behind.

The man\u0153uvring and appear ance of the regiments, commanded by the French officers, called forth his un qualified approval. The British Artillery practice was very successful, and the shrapnell told with tre mendous effect upon the curtain. Runjit, as usual, stuck up his red silk chattah, or umbrella, which, after two or three shots, was rendered utterly useless. It was first struck, I believe, by Lieut. Mackenzie, of the Lodiana troop.

It w7as ascertained by experiment, that the Company's powder carried one-third further than Runjit's. But perhaps the most interesting exhibi tion was that of the Ghoracheras, or irregular horse. Runjit received the Commander in-chief and his suite at one of the Bara Deris, or summer-houses, on the parade ground ; and the Ghoracheras cantered by in single file. There were many hundreds of them in yellow scarfs, tunics, and plumed turbans, armed with pistols, swords, and other accoutrements. Nothing could be more pic turesque, than to see one of these grey bearded veterans come up at a canter, with a long spear or matchlock in his bridle hand, and, reining in his Rosinante for a moment, turn towards the Maharajah, throw down"], [332, "298 runjit's humanity. a piece of money as a token of homage to his old chief and companion in arms, and give him loudly, and emphatically, the national salutation of \" Wah!

Runjit was certainly never much given to the pathetic : I have heard one of his French officers describe him as a man without passion ; but I have been credibly informed, that he has been seen to weep as some of his old soldiers have approached him with a petition, and shewed their wounds as they presented it.

It was, no doubt, by a pre-concerted arrangement, that he and his cortige, consisting of about a dozen retainers, approached during the inspection, to make their salaams for the first time They were all well armed, and covered with dust. Pir Mohamed Khan, a very fat man, wore a steel scull-cap, and a coat of chain-mail. They dismounted, and Runjit and his Sirdars rose to receive them, and gave them a cordial welcome. Runjit coloured, talked, laughed, chuckled, and pulled his own beard incessantly, as he was accustomed to do when much pleased. He could not conceal the delight and satis- faction he felt, because the Patans had ar- rived at a moment when his distinguished visitors were sitting beside him, and wit- nessing what he conceived to be a triumph over his enemy, Dost Mohamed Khan.

Some of the principal Sirdars were invited in the evening, and came in anxious expec tation of seeing the English ladies dance, who, it was understood, were going to per form a quadrille, or a waltz, in order that they might be able to say that they had danced at Lahore. The Sirdars, however, were disappointed, as it was very properly considered inexpedient to indulge their curiosity in this particular. Perhaps they thought it very singular that the ladies were not commanded to dance, whether they were willing or not, as an officer, who was on duty at the court of a Rajah, on the Indus, told me that he was seriously asked, if it were not true that Lord William Ben tinck, when atRupur,hadmade his lady nach, i. e., dance, for the amusement of Runjit.

Shere Sing wore nothing but a plain white scarf and tunic, and did, I believe, eat a little, whilst Rajah Sucheyt Sing, a Hindu by birth, and possessing all the prejudices of a Hindu, sat in state dur ing the whole of dinner time, the \" observed of all observers,\" and covered with magnifi cent jewels, most innocently inhaling the fumes of a fine piece of stewed beef, close to which, by mere accident, he happened to be seated. Vilayuti huren, \" European venison,\" is the name under which beef is usually concealed from a Hindu, and pork from the more inquisitive Mussulman.

On the eighteenth of March, Runjit gave a party in the palace to the ladies of the escort. He sat in his chair as usual, with one foot uncovered. An even number is thought unlucky, and odd numbers, such as eleven, fifty-one, one hundred and one, or eleven thousand, are always preferred, when the amount of a present, or the for tunate hour is under consideration. In making a present, an even number is look ed upon as too decisive in its effects, and as emblematical of a wish to have done with an existing friendship, or compact ; whilst an odd one is considered as leaving it in existence and unfinished, and cer tain, though undefined. Thus the wed ding presents of the royal bride were in odd numbers, as being more lucky ; and"], [338, "ladies' reception. 304 Runjit now sat with one foot unstockinged, in the belief, that nothing which could pass in the course of conversation would be un susceptible of change, and that he thus se cured to himself some undefinable path for the access of good fortune, and means of es cape from a suspicious result. There were present, Miss Fane, Mrs. Fane, Mrs. Torrens, Mrs. and Miss Churchill, Mrs. Bere, and Mrs. Van Cortlandt, a lady married to an officer in the Punjab. They were sepa rately introduced to Runjit, who shook hands with them. Shere Sing sat in a chair, nearly opposite to the Maharajah : on his right were the Commander-in-chief and the ladies ; and on his left, sat No Nehal Sing, and Hera Sing. The dancing girls were singing in front. Nothing, I believe, took place beyond the ordinary run of conversa tion, but it was amusing to watch the two last-mentioned personages. They gazed at the ladies, as if they had never seen them"], [339, "305 PARTING INTERVIEW. before, and would never see them again, their eyes being fairly rivetted upon them during the whole interview ; and I think it more than probable, that No Nehal Sing did not bestow a single thought upon his young bride whilst it lasted. Runjit, who had himself drawn up the prospectus of the manner in which each day was to be occupied, had added a few more to be passed in what he called \" friendly conferences ;\" but, as the hot weather was rapidly advancing, it was considered advisa- ble not to remain longer at Lahore. The festival of the Houli was celebrated on the tw7enty-second. The presents to the officers, i consisting of shawls, gold bracelets, swords, and matchlocks, \u2014 all of which were after- wards seized by the political agent on behalf of the Company, \u2014 were given at the parting interview, which took place, I think, on the twenty-eighth ; and before the end of the x"], [340, "306 THE BURYING FAKIR. month, the Commander-in-chief had re crossed the Sutlij at Ferozpore, and was in full march for Simla. I saw a good deal of the fakir, or jogi, who buries himself, in a sitting posture, for days, weeks, or months ; and was within one march of Lahore, on my return from Kabul, when he was unkennelled, in the presence of the Maharajah, Captain Wade, and Dr. Mc Gregor ; and I could easily have galloped forward in time to see the ceremony, had I been informed of what was going to take place.

In Wilson's sketch of the religious cere-"], [341, "307 JOGI SUPERSTITIONS. monies of the Hindus, we read that the term Jogi, or Yogi, is properly applicable to the followers of the Yoga or Pajantala school of philosophy ; who maintain the possibility of acquiring, even in life, entire command over elementary matter, by means of certain ascetic privations. It is sufficient to ob serve, that these practices consist of long continued suppression of respiration, of inhaling or exhaling the breath in a parti cular manner, sitting in eighty-four different attitudes, fixing the eyes on the top of the nose ; and in endeavouring, by such absti nence, to effect an union, for so the word \"yoga\" signifies, between a portion of vital spirit residing in the body, and that which pervades all nature, and is identical with Siva, considered as the superior being, and the source and essence of all creation. When this mystic union is effected, the Yogi is liberated from his living body, and x 2"], [342, "308 SUPERSTITIONS. regains an entire command over all worldly substances. He can make himself lighter than the lightest substances, heavier than the heaviest ; can become as vast, or as minute, as he pleases ; can traverse all space ; can animate any dead body, by transferring his spirit into it from his own ; can render himself invisible ; can attain all objects ; become equally acquainted with the past, present, and future ; and be finally united with Siva ; and, consequently, ex empted, like the rest of mankind, from being born again upon earth. In the Ayeen Akberi, vol. ii. p. 445, we find, that with regard to sitting in eighty four different ways, it is remarked, that the author has seen many who practise the austerities of the \" assum,\" or sitting, and has been astonished how they can make their muscles, nerves, and bones, so obe-"], [343, "309 SITTING ON AIR. dient to their command. Some of them could hold their breath for an incredible length of time. In the Asiatic Monthly Journal for March, 1829, we find the following account of the Brahmin who sat upon air. \" A Brahmin, old and slightly made, reported to be of high caste, contrives to poise himself in a most extraordinary manner in the air. The only apparatus seen was a piece of plank, which, with four pegs, he forms into a kind of long stool. Upon this, in a little brass saucer or socket, he places, in a perpen dicular position, a hollow bamboo; over which he puts a kind of crutch, like the top of a walking-crutch, covering it with a piece of common hide. These materials he carries with him in a little bag, which is shown to those who come to see him ex hibit.

The blanket was then held up before him, and a gurgling noise was heard, like that occasioned by wind escaping from a bladder or tube, and when the screen was withdrawn he was again standing on terra firma. The same man has a power of remaining under water for several hours. He only said that he was accustomed to it. He remained poised in air for twelve minutes, in the pre sence of the person who gave this account ; but, before the Governor of Madras, he continued on his baseless seat for forty minutes.\" After thus knowing what the Jogi be lieves himself capable of doing, and actually"], [345, "311 THE JOGI FAKIR. can do, there is no difficulty in understand ing how the natives of India can be com pletely deceived by appearances. It is not to be denied, that every European who has been present at the opening of the innermost box, in which the fakir sat, of whom I am speaking, has been stag gered, for the time at least, into a belief of the reality and truth of his pretensions. His whole appearance has been that of a sitting corpse, excepting that there appears to be a swelling over the entire scalp. When hot water and the hot cake has been applied, this swelling has gradually disap peared, and he recovered, as if his whole life had been collected on the top of his head. After the Commander-in-chief had quitted Lahore, I obtained a promise from Runjit that the fakir should be allowed to cross the Sutlij and visit Simla, where I engaged that he should be very hand somely rewarded ; but the Rajah Dhihan"], [346, "312 SHEIK KAMAL BIABANI.

Runjit seemed to enjoy the joke, remarking that the fakir would find it difficult to deceive us. In the Quarterly Oriental Magazine, March and June, 1824, p. 60, it is stated, that in the thirty-fifth of Akber's reign, it was said of Sheik Kamal Biabani, that he possessed the power of transporting himself to a distance ; so that a person who talked with him on one side of the river would, upon crossing to the other, be again saluted"], [347, "runjit's policy. 313 with his voice. Akber went to see him, and offered his whole kingdom if he would instruct him to do so likewise. He refused ; and Akber ordered him to be tied hand and foot, and that he should be tossed into the river, if he refused to give him the in formation he wanted. Upon this the man confessed that he acted in concert with his son, who was on the opposite side of the river, and counterfeited his father's voice. Had Runjit really believed the pretensions of the fakir, he would have acted like Ak ber, and have ordered him to bury himself, guarding him in good earnest ; but he was sceptical, and death and detection might then have followed. The destruction too of a very holy man would have been attri buted to Runjit ; who would, moreover, have deprived himself of a powerful hold over the minds of his subjects, by up setting the pretensions of all other fakirs whatsoever to a preternatural power of any"], [348, "314 CONJECTURES ON THE kind, inasmuch as they could hardly have been ever equal to those of this man. I do not think that his mere refusal to be buried under English surveillance can be fairly regarded as conclusive evidence of his being an impostor. A native would be so suspicious as to find it difficult to divest himself of the idea that some foul play would prevent his success ; and I think it will be admitted, that the mere fact of his allowing himself to be shut up at all, is sufficiently astonishing. The air he inhaled must have been rapidly deprived of its oxygen ; and any concentrated nourishment he may have concealed in his mouth must soon have been exhausted. We must either, then, conclude that he received, by means of pipes, a supply of both these necessaries, or that, in conformity with appearances, he had found out the means of assuming and remaining in a state of suspended animation. The greatest proof of his being an impostor 12"], [349, "fakir's trick. 315 is, I think, that he affirms the length of time he may be buried to be quite imma terial, and that the functions of his body are equally capable of restoration whether he be entombed for ten months or ten days ; but, at the same time, it is clear that the falsity of such an assertion can never be fairly tested, in the face of existing appear ances, until he be locked up with a guard that can be depended upon, and the right of inspection at any time, without public notice, be reserved to his employers.

During the interval, I enjoyed the agree able society of Dr. Wood, already men tioned. No man could possibly bestow more attention upon his patient; but it was doubtful if Runjit ever took any part of the prescribed medicines, although he would go through the farce of sending the fakir Aziz-ud-Dyn, who was his physician in ordinary, as well as secretary of state, to see them prepared and made up.

The Maharajah never, at any place, took a ride without being attended by elephants, bearing his tents, bed, cooking utensils, and full camp equipage; and here he himself, as well as every one with him, was either on horseback, or in his pa- lanquin, before day break ; and, to use a common phrase, \" there was always some- thing going on.\" The artillery practice was worth seeing, because it was so in- famously bad. The elephant fights were less so than might be imagined ; two of these animals were driven at each other, by their respective mahouts or riders ; and after a struggle, in which brute strength, without the least quickness or activity, was brought into play, one of them succeeded in fixing his tusks in such a manner about the head of the other, that he was enabled fairly to lift him off his hind legs : the other, thus defeated, became outrageous,"], [352, "318 MILITARY PASTIMES. and still goaded onward by his mahout, strode furiously over the plain, dispersing the galloping crowd, giving chase to the horsemen, many of whom contended for the honour of running a greater risk, by riding nearer to him, than another. In going out or returning in the morning, the Maharajah would occasionally be annoyed by persons suddenly rising out of the ground under his horse's head; they had petitions to present, or complaints to make ; and unable to approach him in the crowd, had adopted the very knowing plan of dig ging a large hole by the side of the road, and concealing themselves in it till Runjit approached them.

So loud were we in our praises, that Runjit, by whose side we were standing, grew, I thought, a little jealous, and said \" Enough !\" sooner than he otherwise might have done. The Akalis, or Sikh fanatic priests, though considerably reduced in number, are so much respected by the people, that their power is still not to be despised. They had some complaints to make about this time, and be came so outrageous, that Runjit increased the strength of his guard, and two cannon"], [355, "321 UNEXPECTED PETITIONER. loaded with grape were constantly ready for them. At last Runjit appointed a morn- ing, on which he said he would inspect and enlist such among them as he thought fit. We rode to his tent, which was pitched on a plain away from the main camp. Here we found a large guard, and the Akalis ranged in line within, about sixty yards off, and opposite to him. They were called up one by one, their horses and arms were inspected ; some were rejected, and others enrolled amongst his Goracheras.

There were six or seven men screaming at the top of their voices, with an accompani ment of native violins, guitars, finger-drums, and small cymbals. Haji Khan, Dost Mo hamed's commander of cavalry, came in, and I was introduced to him. The life of Haji Baba is no caricature ; and I subjoin the life of Haji Khan to show through what extraordinary circumstances a man may rise to eminence in the East. Of his early life I have heard nothing, excepting that he was a Kashmirian by birth, and that his father was a shawl merchant. Haji Khan started on a pilgrimage to Mecca. He has been heard to say, that while wandering in Arabia he was so destitute, that when an old woman wished to give him some dates, he had nothing to wrap them up in.

Sheyn Khan called him and treated him as his brother. When Sheyn Khan left Mustafa Khan's service, and entered that of the Nawab Jabar Khan, Haji gained favour with the Nawab, who took him into his own service. He after wards went with Futi Khan to the Persian war, and was wounded in the engagement which took place when they penetrated beyond Mushid, where the Afghans were beaten by Hussein- Ali Mirza. Kamran of Herat wished him to enter his service, and Haji Khan was brought before him on a sick bed ; but he refused, and fled from Herat to Kandahar, into the service of Shere Dil Khan, and attended him on his expedition against Kabul. He then com menced intriguing with Dost Mohamed Khan, whom Shere Dil Khan had intend ed to seize at an interview, and to blind. 12"], [362, "328 HAJI KHAN, Haji Khan winked to him, by which he understood he was not to come into the tent.- Shere Dil Khan, finding he could not maintain himself at Kabul, was about to return to Kandahar.

Shere Dil Khan both sent and went to him ; but he would not rise from his seat, saying that he had renounced the pomps and vanities of the world ; but Dost Mohamed afterwards came to him, and soon persuaded him to accept seventy thousand rupees a-year, or about five thousand pounds sterling, as his minister. He was then made Governor of Bamian ; and, having gone out with a large force under the pretence of collecting revenue, he determined to set up for himself. He passed over to Buduk shan, and paid a political visit to Murad Beg, of Kunduz; by whom he and his troops were received with marked attention."], [363, "329 AND HIS CONDUCT.

The Ameer, who was his match, received him with open arms, and said that his father was returned, but, the next day, bestowed the government of Bamian on another. About this time one of his servants stole a purse, belonging to the envoy from Murad Beg. Haji Khan sent the thief to the Ameer to be punished ; but Dost Mo hamed refused to interfere, saying that the guests and the robber were both of his own creating. Subsequently he en tered into a treasonable correspondence"], [364, "330 INTRIGUE WITH THE SIKHS. with Sultan Mohamed Khan, of Peshawur. Dost Mohamed went to take Jelalabad from Ziman Khan.

He next commenced a correspondence with the Sikhs ; and intended, it is said, to have plundered the treasury of Sultan Mohamed Khan, on its way from Kohat to Bunghush, but was prevented from doing so by having taken the wrong road. He then came with Sultan Mohamed Khan to Jelalabad.

It was generally supposed that he would have succeeded ; but Dost Mohamed was suspicious, and refused his offer. Haji Khan still contrived, when I was at Kabul, to be an influential person ; but Mr. Masson, who favoured me with the preceding notice, informed me also, that at the same time he would perhaps receive a secret letter from Runjit Sing, inviting him to forsake Dost Mohamed and join the Sikhs. He would then show the letter to Dost Mohamed, and also a magnanimous answer which he will say he is going to send ; intending all the while to send one of a different import.

Dost Mohamed Khan did not effect his rise to the throne of Kabul without ex periencing his full share of those triumphs and reverses which fall to the lot of every Mussulman who possesses himself of power. Of the fifty or sixty sons of Timour Shah the Sirdozye, there were four that figured conspicuously in the history of Kabul ; the Shahs Mahmud, Ziman, Shuja, and Ayub.

Futi Khan wrote to Mohamed Azim Khan, telling him to seize Dost Mohamed, and a guard was placed over him, but before any further steps were taken, news arrived that Futi Khan had been blinded by Kamran, son of Mahmud. The insulted Begum sent her dress, torn and bandless, to her cousin Kamran, at Herat, who forthwith followed Futi Khan, \u2014 took him prisoner as he returned from Khorassan, where he had been defeated by the Persian Prince, Ali Mirza, and on the principle which considers that what is done"], [373, "339 MARCH UPON KABUL. by one man, is done by his family, put out Futi Khan's eyes, to avenge the insult of fered by Dost Mohamed to his own cousin. It was finally arranged, that Dost Mohamed Khan should march upon Kabul from Kashmir. He was supplied with two thou sand horse, and two laks of rupees. He first came to Peshawur, then governed by Shah Ayub. He paid Ayub honour as King of Kabul, and Ayub gave him assist ance, on condition that he himself should be made King de facto, in case of Dost Mohamed's success ; and sent his son with him also. At this time, Mahmud and the Prince Kamran were at Kandahar. Jehan Guire, Kamran's son, had advanced to Ka bul with six thousand men. A tar Mohamed Khan, a Durani, of the Bamzye family, neither Barukzye, nor Sirdozye, was the re sident governor of Kabul, on behalf of Jehan Guire, and treacherously invited Dost Mohamed to advance.

Dost Mohamed bribed a baker, to allow a mine to be run under a tower, through his oven ; blew up the tower, and so frightened Jehan Guire that he made his escape in the night through theDewaseh Kashi, or painted gate, a small portal on the south side of the Bala Hissar. He then fled through the Hazara mountains to Herat. Pir Mohamed Khan, a Barukzye, and brother of Dost Mohamed Khan, soon after took out Atar Mohamed Khan's eyes with his own hand. Mohamed Azim Khan then came from Kashmir, leaving Nawab Jubar Khan, brother of Dost Mohamed Khan, governor of Kash mir, whom the Sikhs soon afterwards drove out, when they took the valley.

No battle took place, nor bloodshed, excepting that caused by the death of Sultan Ali, who was killed by Ayub, his own brother, previously to his ascending the throne. Sultan Ali occupied the throne for only two months, when Shah Mahmud and Prince Kamran advanced in force from Kandahar, in order to settle the disturb ances at Kabul. They had reached the village of Chahah Asyar, or the four mills ; when suspecting treachery, \u2014 and just as Dost Mohamed Khan, who was Sultan Ali's General, was on the eve of flying with two thousand horse to Kohistan, at the foot of the mountain, \u2014 they retired back to Ghuzni. Finding, when too late, that they had been deceived, they then returned to Kandahar ; but so exasperated were they with the behaviour of the Barukzye, that when on"], [376, "342 DOST MOHAMED REBELS. the march towards Kabul, they ordered Futi Khan, the great enemy of the Sirdo zye, their own family, to be brought out and cut to pieces, in the presence of the whole army. Shah Ayub had been on the throne, as a mere puppet, for eight years, and Mohamed Azim Khan had acted as his minister. Dost Mohamed Khan was merely at this time a Sirdar, or officer about the court. Mohamed Azim Khan upon one occasion went to Shikarpore to collect revenue ; he had got as far as Ghuzni, when he was obliged to return, in consequence of hearing that Dost Mo hamed Khan had rebelled, and set up for king a Sirdozye, Shahsada Munsur, a son of Shah Ziman. This affair was settled amicably, and then Mohamed Azim Khan, and Shah Ayub, returned towards Shikar pore, taking Dost Mohamed with them.

Mohamed Azim Khan, after retiring from Shikarpore, next undertook an expe dition against the Sikhs. He advanced as far as Naushera, about half-way between Peshawur and Attok, when he was told, so I was informed, that Dost Mohamed had made an attack upon his treasure, which, with his harem, he had ordered to remain upon the western side of the Pesha wur river. This part of the story may be doubted, as Mr. Moorcroft, who was in the country at the time, makes no mention of it. He immediately retreated, and with the loss of two or three thousand men, chiefly Ghazis, or religious heroes, (so Mus sulmen are termed when fighting against"], [378, "344 DEATH OF AZIM KHAN. the infidels,) who were principally of the Mohmund, and Eusofzye tribes, returned to Kabul, and died of a broken heart.

Abib Ullah Khan, son of Mohamed Azim Khan, now at Lahore, next became master of the country. His father, when dying, placed his son's hand in that of the Nawab Jubar Khan, brother of Dost Mohamed Khan, who would most likely have been his friend, but being dissipated and head strong, he took from the Nawab the government of the Gilzyes, the tribe that inhabits a large tract of country on the left of the road between Kabul and Ghuzni."], [379, "345 DOST MOHAMED TAKES KABUL. He appointed Dost Mohamed to the go vernment of the Kohistan, but contrived to quarrel w7ith him ; and Dost Mohamed, with Shere Dil Khan, his brother, (before of Kandahar,) advanced and blockaded Abib Ullah Khan, in Kabul, then invited him out, and made him prisoner. Dost Mohamed thus became master of Kabul, a. d. 1824, but could not, I believe, then retain it. He, however, re-instated his bro ther, the Nawab, in the government of the Gilzyes ; which, nevertheless, he afterwards took from him, charging Shere Dil Khan with treachery towards Abib Ullah Khan, quarrelling and fighting with him for four or five months.

They are better than the Persians, without their vivacity; and braver than the Kashmirians, without their cunning.

The room, as with others in Kabul, is ornamented with ro settes and other figures, stamped upon a composition paste of talc, which has some what the elegant appearance of chased silver, and altogether produces a very pleasing effect. On the first evening of my introduction, the Durbar was fully attended. There might be about fifty-five persons present ; amongst them were Duranis and Kuzzel-"], [383, "349 HIS DURBAR. bashes. I was seated next to the Nawab Jubar Khan, with my Anglo-Persian dic tionary by my side, when the Ameer en tered. Every one stood up to receive him. He immediately turned to me, and the Nawab told me to give him my hand ; which he took, repeating his Khosh amdeh aid ! \u2014 \" You are welcome ! \" \u2014 with great emphasis and much apparent sincerity. I presented him with a case of small pistols, with screw barrels. He examined them, snapped one of them out of the window, and asked how far they would carry. I replied, that they would carry much fur ther than any one present would believe. The next day, Mohamed Akber Khan, his second son, who had been trying them, remarked that they were very good, and that he was much pleased with them. We then sat down on the carpet, and he com menced a conversation, asking numerous questions about the different countries I"], [384, "350 A MULLAH'S QUESTION had seen, particularly about the Nya- Duniah, \u2014 \"New World,\" or America, \u2014 which he heard I had visited, as to its riches, the number of inhabitants, the ani mals, and many particulars ; and said that he thought a traveller's life must be very good fun. We then had a dissertation upon the comparative merits of Turkoman and Arab horses. He questioned me much about our own English breed, displaying throughout very just ideas upon every sub ject that he treated. At this moment a black-whiskered mullah entered the room, marched up, and sat himself down imme diately beside me. There was something about him that taught me at once what his profession was, and why he had come. I was not wrong in my surmises ; he com menced by tapping me on the shoulder in order to attract my attention, and, without further preface, began : \u2014 \" I say, how did Christ get up through the seven heavens, as"], [385, "351 AND TRIUMPH. you say he did ?\" and, suiting the action to the word, placed his hands one above the other, by way of representing the ceilings ofthe different heavens. I regretted very much that my then very imperfect know ledge of Persian prevented me from pro ceeding with the argument, as I could have wished. I believe I somehow contrived to admit, that it must have been very difficult ; and, as the priest got no further answer, he looked round the Durbar in triumph. This was, I believe, the same person whom Lieutenant Burnes puzzled, by asking, how a man could say Mussulman prayers at the North Pole ; for which, I understood, he obtained great credit amongst the learned at Kabul; and whom, Mr. Wolfe, when questioned by him, and rather jeer ingly, on the nature of the resurrection, silenced by a counter-question on the sub ject of his own birth.

I observed at once the difference between the courts of Runjit Sing and Dost Mo hamed, and the mummeries that were acted before Shah Shuja in his retreat at Lodiana. I thought of the shawl tents of Runjit, and the jewelled magnificence of the Sikhs who surrounded the person of their chief, \u2014 not one of them, not even an European officer, was allowed to sit on the ground without permission, \u2014 and I com-"], [387, "SHAH SHUJA's CEREMONY. 353 pared his Durbar with the one before me.

The only sign of a king being present was that exhibited by a master of ceremonies, who made more noise than any one else, in endeavouring to preserve order and silence. I also thought again of Shah Shuja at Lodiana ; the royal recess in which he sat enthroned to receive visitors ; the ranks of bare-footed attendants who stood around, with their hands resting on their girdles, in the most approved Oriental fashion ; Baron Hugel and myself, with Captain Wade, the political agent, \u2014 to whom he must necessarily be obliged for a a"], [388, "354 KABUL COURTIERS. every application to Government on his behalf, \u2014 denied even the privilege of sitting on a chair in his presence. I believe that I myself am one of the very few who had then ever received such an honour ; and it was granted me at my own request, when I went to take his portrait. The next in rank to the Ameer Dost Mohamed Khan was the Nawab Jubar Khan, who was generally in the Durbar, with several of his followers. Another brother, Pir Mohamed Khan, brother of Sultan Mohamed Khan, of Peshawur, was not so frequent a visitor. There was an other brother in Kabul, who was so ill as to be always confined to his bed. There were also present Haji Khan, commander of the cavalry, whom I have already noticed ; and Abdul Samut, a Persian, originally I believe a private in Colonel Skinner's horse, in India ; and two other Naybs, or"], [389, "355 LANGUAGES IN THE DURBAR. generals, whose names I forget. The lan guage of the Afghans is Poshtu ; the Tajiks, or aborigines of the country, speak Poshtu and Persian. In the Durbar there is more Poshtu than Persian spoken, and more Per sian than Turki. If Dost Mohamed ad dresses an Afghan, he speaks Poshtu. To the Kuzzelbash of Kabul, and visitors from Turkistan, he speaks Turki. Persian is spoken occasionally by all. I breakfasted several times with the Ameer in the Dur bar, and on two or three occasions sat next to him, when he would help me with his own royal fingers from his own dishes. \" I hear,\" said he, one day, \" that the Feringis never eat with their fingers.\" I told him he had heard aright. \"And why is it so ?\" said he. \" The ladies would not allow it.\" \" Why not ?\" he said. \" Because,\" I replied, but not without some hesitation, \"they would say it was not cleanly.\" \" Why not cleanly ?

They were certainly as white and clean as hot water alone \u2014 for they rarely use soap \u2014 could make them. I then had no other answer to give than that it was not the custom. \" No ! and there is no other rea son for it, either,\" growled out the black whiskered mullah aforesaid, who had been listening all the time to what had been said. Mohamed Akber Khan, the second son of Dost Mohamed, \u2014 he who was approach ing to raise the late siege of Ghuzni, as already noticed, \u2014 was a well-meaning, spi rited, fat, but handsome, young man, and usually seated near him in Durbar. He was the favourite son by a favourite wife, whose influence kept him in his place. Mo hamed Afzul Khan, the eldest son, was absent, collecting tribute during the whole time I was at Kabul.

A pro mising young scapegrace, named Hyder Khan, now a prisoner at Lodiana, is the next brother. He was learning to govern by residing at Charika, near the Kohistan, or country at the foot of the Hindu Kosh, of Kabul ; and had some of his horses stolen one night by the Kohistanis, when Mr. Masson and myself were visiting Be ghram. A younger brother of Hyder Khan, Mohamed Ameen Khan, was often resting on his father's knee. Two or three others, mere children, would sometimes make their appearance in Durbar, to get a kiss, or a rupee, from their father and the Nawab. Nothing could be more simple than the fare of Dost Mohamed Khan. In the mor ning, about eight or nine o'clock, a number of melons were brought into the Durbar, and were eaten in an unripe state, at least"], [392, "358 KABUL FARE. not so much ripened as we should eat them in England. It is frightful to see an Orien tal cutting away at an unripe melon, and swallowing every part of it excepting the green outside. Numerous deaths are the consequence of this pernicious practice, and every large town in the East is more or less afflicted by sickness during the melon sea son. In about an hour after the fruit had been demolished, a more substantial break fast was brought in. The dishes contained nothing but mutton, over-roasted or boiled to rags, with or without vegetables, and covered with the rice of Peshawur, the finest in the world. Its grains, when boiled, swell out to a length of three-fifths of an inch. Perhaps eight or ten persons would remain behind in the Durbar, to partake of this meal ; the others would retire, from inclination rather than etiquette; at least I did not think that invitations to remain and eat were given beforehand. The din-"], [393, "359 SUPPER AND CHESS. ner, or rather supper, was of the,same kind, after the evening Durbar. I had once thus an opportunity of seeing Dost Mo- hamed more enfamille ; he played at chess with one of the chiefs present, and the others merely conversed or watched the game. Dost Mohamed seemed to enjoy it amazingly, although he was, if I rightly recollect, beaten. An extension of the hand to that of his antagonist, accompa- nied with a hearty squeeze, was the method by which he expressed his delight at having taken a piece from him. A similar action usually attends the understanding a joke, or a play upon words; and when, in the East, the parties happen to be standing near each other, and are old friends, I have seen them bow their heads till their fore heads met, laughing heartily all the time, by way of intimating how much in unison are their feelings upon the subject of their mirth. Whilst the Ameer was playing at"], [394, "360 PICTURE-TAKING. chess, I sat dow7n to make a portrait of his son, Mohamed Ameen Khan. A few prints, which I had with me, were often produced in the Durbar. Two were frequently exhibited by particular desire ; one was a portrait of Her Majesty Queen Adelaide. It was a print ; but its value, in their ideas, was much enhanced by the colouring which I had purposely added; and flattering and numerous were the enco miums which were universally lavished upon the Taj-i-Dowlah \u2014 \" Crown of the state \" \u2014 of England. Another was an excellent mez zotinto of a French lady, \u2014 Mademoiselle Mars, I believe ; which was seized upon, after having been frequently exhibited, by Mohamed Akber Khan, and search was made, I fear unsuccessfully, throughout Kabul for a piece of glass that was neces sary to render its framing complete.

The company were convulsed with laugh ter; but he peremptorily ordered the man to come and sit down opposite to me.

In this I was happy enough to please him, only he wanted a long slip of paper stuck on the top of the picture, in order that he might see the full length of an enormous spear which he held in his hand. \" Of what use would that be ?\" said the Ameer ; \" any one can see what it is you have in your hand.\" Dost Mohamed Khan is himself a good critic on animal painting. He is one of the very few Orientals who can comprehend, without a question, the meaning of a shadow, or why one side of the face should be dark and the other light, and why, in some posi tions, more of one eye should be seen than the other.

He liked evidently to see a horse pourtrayed with all its faults, where they existed ; not desiring that either the crest should be raised, or the quarters enlarged, according to the fancy of the painter, as is always the case in the East. Dost Mohamed is as fond of horses as his powerful rival, Runjit. In the hot weather he rode every day, at tended by some of his courtiers, to the Bagh, or garden of Timour Shah, where he used to sit, on a raised and carpetted platform, sheltered from the heat by a wooden roof, and the shade of aspen and mulberry trees ; whilst before and around him were picketted, perhaps, three hundred horses ; his favourites, of course, being quite close to him.

A well-bred Turkoman horse could easily be sent from Persia to Eng land, via Trebizonde. The last portrait I attempted was that of the Ameer Dost Mohamed Khan himself; no one could possibly sit quieter.

His revenue, since the loss of Kashmir, Peshawur, and the provinces to the west of the Indus (Attok or Sinde), did not exceed twenty three laks, which in Kabul rupees, ave raging about two-thirds of the value of those of Hindustan, is equivalent to about 160,000/. sterling. The poorness of his treasury kept his invention for ever on the stretch ; and I heard, that many an act of injustice had been committed, for the sake of procuring money. Property was sometimes seized, and lists were made out of those who were able to spare a little, but who generally preferred paying, to going to prison. His excuse for all this was, that without it government could not be carried on ; and yet if any one else had"], [410, "374 DOST MOHAMED'S JUSTICE. held the reins in Kabul, matters would have been ten times worse. The chief himself, having run his career through ad venture of every complexion, was well ac quainted with the character of his country men, and was naturally suspicious of all around him : being alike unassisted and un impeded by laws, his motives for surveil lance were doubly imperative, and the vigorous measures which he felt himself obliged to adopt were, no doubt, often and unjustly tinged with the imputation of tyranny. He took care to keep up at least the semblance of justice towards the lower classes of his subjects, and I have before remarked, that it was a common saying amongst them, \" Is Dost Mohamed dead, that there is no justice ?\" A soldier demanded his discharge when the treasury was empty, because he could not get his pay.

I saw him hanging by the feet, after having been impaled on a lofty gallows, erected like that of Hainan, opposite to the King's gate. A horrible murder was committed whilst 1 was at Kabul : blood was observed to drop from a bag, which an old woman was carrying through the bazaar : she said that it contained leeches freshly applied : it was, however, opened in the crowd ; and the head of a young and beautiful woman was found in it, with her bridal ornaments upon her brow ; to ob tain which, she had been sent to sleep"], [412, "376 FISCAL REVENUE. by the use of narcotics, and then mur dered. The reign of Timour Shah was still remembered by the older inhabitants of Kabul, as that in which the city enjoyed its greatest modern prosperity. He was a liberally-minded ruler, and was known to lend a man money, and tell him to go and trade with it. The revenue of Dost Mohamed was certainly on the in crease ; he had overturned the old system of collecting, and generally took one third of the produce of all lands under cultivation. Yet on a sudden emergency, I have known him exact five or ten rupees from every shop in the bazaar. But the whole of his fiscal revenue did not amount to more than three laks, or about 20,000/. sterling. Nothing came into the city without payment of a few pice, or half-"], [413, "377 MILITARY FORCE. pence ; every sheep paid one, and one sheep in every forty was the property of the Ameer ; an officer, acting as a broker, again taxed them in the market; another duty was paid for the mark which showed that the broker's tax had been paid. The posteen, a leathern jacket maker, or currier, paid half a shahi \u2014 about three farthings \u2014 in the rupee, according to the value of the posteen ; so that the purchaser of the sheep in the market had to pay two or three rupees for it. When I was in Kabul, Dost Mohamed Khan was in possession of sixty guns, of different calibre ; and could at any time command a force of twelve thousand ca valry. The number of irregular infantry depended upon the state of his finances ; but it might have been increased, I believe, to eighty or one hundred thousand men, in case of a religious war. The Patans, as"], [414, "378 ABDUL SAMI KHAN. horsemen, are more formidable than the Sikhs.

I forget their numerical force, but it did not amount to more than a few hundreds. I several times met Mirza Abdul Sami Khan, the prime-minister. He was a fat, fresh-coloured, and good-natured man, slightly marked with the small-pox, a bon vivant, and very dissipated. He was the only person in the confidence of the Ameer. In his convivial hours he was generally the merriest of the party, and he always treated me with the most cordial civility. It was amusing, upon state occasions, such as at the introduction of Allahdad Khan, the Tak Rajah, to see him standing at the door with a wand of office, he being one"], [415, "379 INVITATION TO SUPPER. of the greatest men in Kabul ; whilst any person of low rank would seat himself without ceremony, after having made his salaam to the Ameer.

I was about to leave Kabul shortly afterwards, and the Ameer was exceedingly anxious for the long delayed answers to the letters which he had sent to the Indian Government. We found but a few guests, and two of the principal singers in Kabul. They sang a great deal ; and our host and his guests were apparently much delighted with their performances. He made his remarks to us from time to time, and translated the words. The Af ghans had then also, as was well-known, sent to Mohamed Shah of Persia, for assist ance against the Sikhs.

My friend the Nawab and his de pendents, when visiting me, were constantly inventing wars and rumours of wars, chiefly from the side of Persia, in order to see what I could say in answer to them : that the Shah was fast approaching Herat, with an immense army ; that \"Ingeil Sahib,\" for so they then called Sir John Mc Neill, had offered them tw7o crore of rupees (two mil lion sterling !) if they would not advance ; and fifty other stories equally ridiculous, some of which I laughed at, in order to show that I was not to be deceived in that way, whilst I refuted others by a simple reference to probabilities. The kind Na wab would sometimes taunt me, but good naturedly, with the change of feeling to wards the Afghans, by referring to the golden times of Mr. Elphinstone's mission to Shah Shuja. \" Sahib ! \" said he, \" all the"], [417, "381 SIR ALEXANDER BURNES. good name the English have in these coun tries is owing to Elphinstone Sahib !\" But this was before Sir Alexander Burnes' second mission, as that gentleman's name is revered in every country that he passed through ; and no one that ever had only the honour of a word from him failed, as it seemed to me, to call and inquire after him. One man, who showed me a watch he had given him, wished me to take him back to England, that he might again see his master. At this supper, it appears that the minister \u2014 most likely by the orders of his master \u2014 had determined to try the old game with me. One of his first remarks, for instance, contained a hint to me of the possibility of my being plundered on my return to Hindustan, if the answ7er to the Governor-General's letter did not arrive in time, or if the contents should not be satisfactory. \" You are aware,\" said he, with a very knowing look, and drawing at"], [418, "382 FICTITIOUS DANGERS. the same time a map on the floor with his hands, \" that you have a range of moun tains to pass between this and Jelalabad, that then you have a plain to cross, and that again, on the other side, you will find the Mohmund Afghans.\" Confident, how ever, in the Nawab's protection, and feel ing quite sure that at this juncture they would not dare to connive at the robbery of an Englishman, I replied merely by a low bow and a smile. He then proceeded to make remarks of a political tendency upon the wording of the songs, scarcely a syllable of which I could distinguish. Not so Mr. Masson, who, understanding all he sang, was giving me a very signi ficant glance from time to time. He after wards explained to me the meaning of the songs. The singer was a perfect Davide, in his way, and exhibited a power of execution far superior to any thing I have ever heard in the East. \" If he continue to improve"], [419, "383 SINGING STRATAGEM. as hitherto,\" remarked the minister, \" he will be quite a prodigy.

I made the best excuse I could for eating but scantily of any thing so very cloying. The Ameer's manner arose entirely out of his anxiety to get an answer from the Indian Government. The good Nawab himself, at parting with me the next morning, put on, for the same reason, an air of coldness and reproach, which he had never till that moment as sumed.

One of the chief reasons for the delay upon this occa sion, was caused by the interregnum which occurred between the retirement of Lord William Bentinck and the arrival of Lord Auckland. I have never doubted for an instant the correctness of that line of policy which it eventually became necessary to pursue, by sending the late expedition to Afghanistan. I have never doubted for an instant that it would succeed, or that Shah Shuja would be well received by the Afghans. When, at the battle near Kandahar, which he fought with Dost Mohamed in 1834, he ordered his elephant to be turned round, and fled, there were few of the leading men of Kabul who had not commenced an in trigue with him.

He was with Shah Shuja when he left Lodiana, at the end of 1833 ; and, when first employed, had obtained a com pany and a gun, and was sent ahead to Malai Koteler. Afterwards, the Shah gave Mr. C. three hundred men and two guns. He had then, altogether, about six or seven hundred men under his command.

The Vakil of Hydrabad, Kosseyn Shah, went to Kam- pore, three kos (six miles), to meet Shah Shuja, presented him with fifty thousand rupees and five or six horses, some sw7ords, and two tents, and brought him to Shikar- pore, where he remained ten months.

Shah Shuja beat him, and took four guns ; many of the chiefs of Sinde were killed, and Kosseyn Shah was amongst the num ber.

He then encamped at a village three miles from Shi karpore; and afterwards marched through the desert the whole night, and arrived at Kundah, a village with a stream. From Shahlmerstan he sent letters to the Ameer of Kelat, desiring him to send him five lacks of rupees, ten horses, and some ca mels. The Ameer sent him a lack, twenty camels, and three horses, and one horse to Mr. Campbell.

Afterwards, Dost Mohamed went to Kandahar to oppose him, with twenty thousand horse, five thousand foot, and about eighteen guns. When Dost Mohamed was within twelve miles of the city, Shah Shuja withdrew his guns from the batteries, left the old town, and encamped at Ava Sava. On the following morning Dost Mohamed arrived at Kan dahar ; on the next, Dost Mohamed's son, Mohamed Akber Khan, came out to fight, with about twelve thousand men, chiefly cavalry I believe, and four guns. There was a battle, without any important result, till, about five o'clock, Shah Shuja ordered Mr. Campbell to go against the enemy, with the two battalions and four guns.

But afterwards it was right to leave well alone. Between the British dominions in India, and the confines of the Russian do minions, there are three distinct nations, who are enemies to each other by blood, and by religion. The Persians, who are Shiah Mahometans, and very bigoted, are ever ready to quarrel with the Afghans, who are Sunis ; and the Sikhs, who are Hindus, can always be let loose upon these last also.

He may still, perhaps, cal culate upon assistance from Persia ; and if the Russians take Khiva, he will commence an intrigue with them forthwith : they will receive his information and his overtures with caution, and can offer none but con ditional promises, but will always find him a ready listener to any proposals of a po litical nature, which they may think it worth their while to make.

Khiva, amongst the orientals south of that range, is generality known by the name of its principal city Hurghunge, i. e. Houri-Gunge (signifying, the town or place, I believe, of the Houris) : it was so named, I think, by Timour Lung (Tamerlane), either from the beauty of the place, or of the women ; and the Great Desert (Sahara), or plain of Central Asia, is usually called by them the Dusht, or plain of Kuptchak. M. Mora vies, in his voyage in Turkoma nia, describes the country of Khiva as a rich oasis watered by irrigation from the Amu, or Oxus, on which it is situated, and highly productive. He estimates its length and width at more than one hundred miles ; says that it contains five considerable towns and many villages, and that three hundred thousand persons acknowledge the Khan of Khiva as their sovereign.

On the north it is bounded by the course of the Amu, or Oxus, that empties itself into the sea of Aral ; on the south-east a steppe separates it from the kingdom of Bokhara, and on the south-west it is separated by sandy plains and steppes from Teke, which he adds is an oasis refreshed by water courses swollen by the rain. The latitude of the town of Khiva is forty-one degrees, forty minutes ; and its longitude, from the Island of Ferro, seventy-eight degrees, ten minutes.

From Hurghunge to Orenburg it was twenty-three days with camels, and ten days with horses ; and that this road also could only be passed in the spring. The great Kirghiz lake, or sea ot Aral, was reached in four days by camels. By the other route, direct from Bokhara to Jaman-Kala, Yemen- Killah, or Orsk, on the frontiers of Russia, it was a thirty days' march for camels, and twenty for horses. The first Russian mission to Khiva was sent by Peter the Great, but the unfortu nate Prince Bekevitch, who commanded it, was cruelly assassinated. In 1813 another attempt was made to open a negotiation with the Turkomans, who forthwith sent ambassadors to request the assistance of Russia against the Per sians. But as they arrived at a time when the Russians were concluding a friendly 12"], [449, "moravief's mission. 413 treaty with the Persians, the Turkomans were obliged to retire in disgust. M. Moravief was dispatched in 1819 : the object of his mission, as declared in his conversation with the Khan of Khiva, ap pears to have been simply to induce the Khan to order his trading caravans to come directly to the port of Krasnorodsk, on the Caspian, and there dispose of their merchan dise, after a march which would occupy only seventeen days ; instead of allowing them to proceed as usual, by the old route to Monghichlak, which was without water, and occupied a month. The Khan replied, that the tribes on the route to Monghich lak were devoted and submissive to him, whereas on the proposed route the caravans would certainly be pillaged by the Kadjurs (Persians), and that therefore he could not consent to such an arrangement.

It is seen, that the banks of the sea of Aral have been accurately surveyed by Russian engineers, who have been oc cupied in the steppes, or plains, of the Kirghiz-Kazaks, from the years 1820 to 1826, that its level is much higher (one hundred and eighteen feet ?) than that of the Caspian, and that the natives say there is a whirlpool in the centre, which no vessel can approach with safety ; a circumstance, if true, which would lead us to suspect the existence of a subterranean communication with the Caspian.

These last (who also inhabit the plains of Pamere, and plunder the cara vans passing between Ladak and Yarkund) are quite a distinct race from the Kirghiz- Kazaks, formerly the subjects of Arslan Khan, Alp Arslan, the cotemporary of the Emperor Baber, who could bring four"], [453, "417 KIRGHIZ KAZAK HORDES. hundred thousand of them into the field. They are now divided into three distinct hordes, the great, the middle, and the little, whose united population amounts to upwards of four millions. We find that the cause of this division originally, was, according to their traditions, a partition of the coun- try amongst the three sons of one of their deceased Khans. The Little Horde is the nearest to Europe ; its winter quarters are always upon the banks of the Syr, or Jaxar- tes ; upon which river M. Levchine has fur- nished us with a very learned dissertation. This river enters the sea of Aral. The horde is also at the mouth of the Emba, which empties itself into the Caspian. In summer, the horde remains upon the banks ofthe Emba. The Middle Horde occupies an extent of country which lies more to the eastward. The Great Horde extends itself to the frontiers of China.

Levchine gives a history of the manner in which the Kirghiz-Kazaks have gradually become the subjects of Rus sia ; and adds the following remarks, which apply equally to the Turkomans of the de sert. \"No zealous Mahometan regards as sacred, a convention made with a Christian. The Kirghiz respects the obligations by which his forefathers have bound him so much the less, because he is persuaded that they could never bind any but themselves, and that for the son and grandson there is no other law but personal advantage, &c.\" M. Levchine says, that, as from the nature of the soil he inhabits, the Kirghiz can never be an agriculturist, he procures grain from his neighbours in exchange for cattle. It is more than ninety years since the Kirghiz have been considered as being under the dominion of Russia ; and eighty"], [455, "419 THE CLIMATE. years have elapsed since the Russian Go vernment has in vain exerted itself to esta blish amongst them a certain organization ; but that money expended, trouble taken, and advice given, have all been hitherto without effect ; whilst the repeated attacks of the Kirghiz upon the Russian lines, the carrying off horses and those whom they take prisoners, the pillage of the caravans, their frequent actions with Russian detach ments, and numerous acts of violence ofthe same nature, enable us to see what idea the Kirghiz have of their subjection to Russia. M. Levchine informs us that the cli mate of the Kirghiz Kazaks is particularly remarkable for the extremes of heat and cold ; the winters are very rigorous, the heat of the dog-days insupportable.

The soldiers of Timour Lung died of the cold on the banks of the Syr. M. Levchine remarks of the climate of the Steppes in general, that the spring appears suddenly, and passes away rapidly ; that the summer is dry and burning ; that the autumn is rainy, gloomy, and short; that the winter is long, dry, and constantly cold. The Kirghiz, he adds, rarely en camp in a large number at the same spot, as there would not be sufficient space for their cattle ; while the Steppes of the Kir ghiz Kazaks are without water, whence results an excessive dryness, w7hich is to be attributed to the scarcity of rain and the extreme heat of summer ; that salt is"], [457, "421 SOIL OF THE STEPPES. found every where, and that waters free from salt are very rare. The soil of the Steppes is of clay, or clay mixed with sand, and almost always impregnated with salt; and, in many places, the aspect of the country offers to the sight evident traces of having been, as it were, recently covered by the waves of the sea. The enormous snows of winter, when melted, produce water which ought to compensate for the want of rain ; but it cannot sink deeply into the clay soil, in consequence of the opposition offered by the substratum of rock which lies under it ; so that the waters of the melted snows run in great masses, precipitating themselves towards the rivers, lakes, morasses, and moving sands, without having time to dilute the large spaces which they traverse in this furious manner.

In his chapter on the mountains found in the centre of the plains of the Kirghiz Kazaks, M. Levchine has given us a curious remark of M. Changine, on the Mount Iman, situ- ated near the lake of that name, on the right bank ofthe Ichim. \" The mountains are of granite ; but they astonish the geo- logist, and arrest the attention of the ob- server, in that they are divided, throughout the whole length of their horizontal deve- lopment from north to south, by parallel beds of quartz and siliceous slate.

I here propose a just observation : a phe nomenon so new7 contradicts the theories of the formation of primitive substances, and makes me abstain from all conclu sion.'' The land of the Kirghiz Kazaks most free from sand, and most fertile, is in their northern region, between fifty-one and fifty-five degrees of latitude. Its extremity may be figured in idea by a line, which would be extended between the fortress of Orsk and the foot of Semiarsk ; possess ing on the eastern side of it the qualifica tions necessary for colonization, abounding in pasture, wood, and water. The isthmus which separates the Caspian from the sea of Aral is called by the Kirghiz Kazaks the Oust-Ourt, signifying, in then own language, a \" plateau, or high plain.\" Its narrowest width does not appear to"], [460, "424 DESCRIPTION OF THE OUST-OURT, exceed one hundred and sixty-five miles. The length of the sea of Aral is about two hundred and seventy miles, and its breadth one hundred and forty. The Oust-Ourt, says M. Levchine, is not watered by a single river ; and it no where produces good forage, or means of subsistence [den rees]. The briars and herbage which grow there are good for camels, but not for horses, still less for sheep. Springs are rare, and the water is far from the surface of the earth. Winds and hurricanes are added to the infertility of the soil, so that the elevated and exposed plains are entirely uninhabited, and the Kirghiz Ka zaks have never encamped there in winter. M. Levchine inserts a geological account of the Oust-Ourt, extracted from the jour nal of M. Eversmaun, naturalist to a Rus sian expedition under Major General Berg, which was sent, in 1825-6, to make a de scription of it. Amongst other remarks he"], [461, "425 AND THE DIFFERENT ROUTES. informs us, that the height of the plateau, above the sea of Aral, no where exceeds six hundred feet. He has given us a valuable account of the different routes by which these regions are traversed, from north to south. By one of the two first which he mentions the Russians most probably marched to wards Khiva. They lead from the fortress of Sara'itchi. Kovskaia, across the Emba river, on the north of the Caspian, to Khiva, by the Oust-Ourt ; after having descended from which, all the caravans move forward to Khiva, where they arrive in twenty five or twenty-six days' march. The ruins of buildings, the remains of fortifications, and some solidly-constructed wells, show that these two routes were opened by people anterior to the Kirghiz Kazaks, and are by some attributed to the descendants of Chenghiz Khan. Another route, longer"], [462, "426 ORENBURG TO BOKHARA. than the former, but more convenient, passes over the Oust-Ourt, and then fol lows the banks of the Sea of Aral down wards to the Oxus. There are many routes from Orenburg to Bokhara. The most remarkable is that fol lowed by the Russian mission under Baron Meyendorf, in 1820, which is detailed, and occupied from the tenth of October to the twentieth of December. There are two routes from Orenburg direct to Khiva, without passing by the fort of Saraitchi Kovskaia. One, which follows the route to Bokhara, joining the north-east bank of the Sea of Aral, and fol lowing it downwards to Hurghunge. The second running along the western bank of the Sea of Aral. Orsk [Yeman-Kala] is the point in the Russian frontier which is nearest to Bokhara. Many routes for Bok-"], [463, "427 DIFFERENT ROUTES. hara commence at Orsk, which are reunited as they approach the Syr, or Jaxartes. In 1821, Baron Meyendorf returned from Bok- hara to Orsk, and estimated the distance between the two places from one thousand two hundred and fifty to one thousand three hundred versts ; somewhat less than one thousand English miles, a verst being three quarters of a mile. The latitude of Khiva is forty-one degrees, forty minutes ; and its longitude seventy-eight degrees, ten minutes, from the Isle of Ferro. The lati- tude of Orenburg is fifty-one degrees, forty minutes ; its longitude seventy-two degrees, fifty minutes, from the Isle of Ferro. Orsk appears to be about twenty-five miles to the southward of Orenburg, and about one hundred and ninety miles to the east of it. M. Levchine mentions several other routes, from Troitska to Bokhara, and from the fortress of Petropaulovskaia to Bokhara. 8"], [464, "428 DIFFERENT ROUTES. From Semiarsk to Tashkhend.

The chapter on the commerce carried on by the Kirghiz Kazaks with the neigh bouring countries appears to me so inter esting and valuable, that I have here trans lated nearly the whole of it, and almost literally. M. Levchine says, \" Frequent as the attacks, accompanied by pillage and devastation, of the Kirghiz Kazaks may be upon the countries contiguous to their Steppes, commerce is a recompense for all the losses caused by their foolish and impudent rapacity ; commerce, we say, renders their vicinity very advantageous to China, but still much more so to Russia."], [466, "430 TRADE AND COMMERCE The Khivians, the Bokharis, the inhabitants of Tachkhend and Kohen, as well as those of Little Bokhara and Oriental Turkistan, trade with them ; but with less advantage than the Russians and Chinese, for these reasons : \u2014 \" First, That there are a great quantity of manufactured goods delivered by China and Russia to the hordes ofthe Kirghiz, of such a nature, that a great part of them would not find an outlet elsewhere. \" Secondly, The need that China and Russia have of raw produce, which they receive from the Kirghiz, at a low price, in exchange for manufactured goods. \" Thirdly, The measures taken by the Governments of both empires for the ex tension of commerce. However, the mea-"], [467, "431 WITH THE RUSSIANS AND CHINESE. sures taken are not at all the same on the part of the two states. The Russian Go vernment, to arrive at its end, employs expense and care; forms establishments, and establishes markets of exchange ; gives to the Kirghiz privileges, arms the cara vans, distributes presents. The Chinese employ menace, vexations, and a despotic severity. They themselves set a value upon the cattle which are brought to them ; give in exchange merchandize, or ingots [sycee] of silver, according to their own regulations, and sometimes according to their own good pleasure ; and, in order to avoid disputes, complaints, explanations, questions, and exactions [avanies], with the Chinese Go vernment, the Kazaks return murmuring, the Chinese forbidding them to enter their towns. With regard to this note I may be allowed to remark here, that those whom I have questioned in Tibet and Kashmir, on the subject of the Chinese Government of"], [468, "432 TRADE AND COMMERCE.

Orenburg, Troitsk, the forts Petropavlofsk Presnogorkofskoi, Ortrisk (Yeman Kala), Semipalatinsk, Oust-Kamenogorskaia, and Ouralsk, are the places where they come to trade in the greatest numbers. Orenburg is the most important of all. The Kirghiz trade principally with the Chinese at Kovld ja, or, as the Chinese call it, Hi. The best time for commerce or ex change is from the middle of June to the middle of November. The Kirghiz go for the purpose of making exchanges to Khiva, Bokhara, Kokan, and Tashkhend, whither also other trading peopleg o.

The merchandise which the Kirghiz deliver to their neighbours is the same every where. It can assuredly only con sist of their flocks, or the produce of their flocks. In detail, it comprises sheep, horses, horned cattle, camels, goats, goats' hair, wool of different animals and of dif ferent qualities ; skins of goats, foxes, kor saks (?), hares and marmots, felts, armiat china (?), dakhi (a kind of habit), touloiipes (sheep-skins sewn together in pelisses), horns of antelopes, and madder roots. These are the articles which the Kirghiz hordes furnish to Russia and other nations, but the Russians have the greater share of them. M. Levchine speaks of the great quan tity of money which the Kirghiz, the Bok-"], [471, "435 NUMBER OF CATTLE EXCHANGED. haris, and the Khivians, possessed from 1748 to 1755. It formed part of the pil laged treasure, after the death of Nadir Shah ; and these three last-mentioned peo ple came to the Russian frontiers with bags full of Indian rupees, and other oriental coins, or with ingots of precious metal. He gives a table, containing a detailed account of the number of horses, oxen, sheep, and goats, that have been ex changed in commerce by the Kirghiz, at Orenburg, from the year 1745 to 1820. Before the year 1745, the Kirghiz were not known at Orenburg, except by their incur- sions.

In 1820, horses and colts sixty-eight ; oxen one thousand and seventy-four ; sheep one hundred and sixty-thousand two hun dred and ninety-six ; goats three thousand two hundred and sixty-eight. The old inhabitants of Orenburg say, that in 1786-7, the commerce was most flourishing, and affirm at that place alone six hundred thousand sheep were exchanged by the Kirghiz. Including other places, probably not less than a million of sheep crossed the Russian frontier in each of these years. The number of horses that entered by Orenburg and different places, amounted to fifty thousand a year : now, on the contrary,"], [473, "437 CAMELS. the Kirghiz buy the Russian horses in great numbers. The Kirghiz do not exchange many camels with the Russians, but the Khivians and the Bokharis buy a great number. The commerce of the Kirghiz in great cattle is very inconsiderable, and almost entirely car ried on at Troitsk. The Kirghiz say, that they used to deliver to their neighbours in China, Bokhara, Khiva, and different countries, as much cattle as they exchanged away to Russia, altogether amounting to two million sheep, and one hundred thou sand horses, without speaking of other mer chandise. M. Levchine proceeds to re mark, that this state of things was very probable during the last century, but is impossible under existing circumstances ; and that internal dissensions and Barantas (incursions for mutual reprisal, made by one horde into the settlements of another) have 12"], [474, "438 TOTAL NUMBERS OF CATTLE. so diminished the number of their flocks, and the Khirghiz studs, that they do not send above half the quantity of cattle they sent formerly ; and that in the first years of this century, the exchange of the Russians with the Kirghiz was in a still more wretched state. In 1820, the whole number of cattle of all kinds exchanged along the frontier, did not exceed four hundred and eleven thousand. We may infer, from all this, that the Russian population, and their breed of horses, is fast increasing ; and that their farms are in such a thriving state, that they have far less occasion than formerly to seek assistance from their neighbours. The Kirghiz take in return for their cat tle, and the raw produce which they im-"], [475, "439 ARTICLES EXCHANGED. port into Russia, various articles in cast iron and copper, such as cauldrons, tripods on which they place them, sewing thimbles, needles, scissars, knives, hatchets, padlocks, scythes, sickles, &c. ; also woollen cloths, velvets, brocades, silk stuffs, lace, ribands, handkerchiefs, cords, boxes, alum, copperas, false pearls, little glasses, linen, snuff, white and red paint, beaver skins, and worked leather called couftes. This leather is known in Kashmir, and the northern parts of India, as \" Bolgar,\" and is that which we know in Europe as Russian leather ; and is called Bolgar, from the ancient kingdom of Bolga ria, which formerly flourished on the banks of the Volga, in the countries which now form the government of Kasan and Simbirsk ; whence Central Asia was furnished with all the productions ofthe north.

The troops ap pointed to protect the frontiers, are not in cluded in this remark, for the government maintained them at a period when, in fact, no commerce existed between the Kirghiz and the Russians. The Chinese principally furnish to the Kirghiz, silken stuffs, porcelain, brocades, silver, tea, glazed pottery, and the other produce of their manufactories.

This interposition is injurious, and always dangerous, but the merchants of Khiva, Bokhara, Kashkar, Tachkhend, and the neighbouring cities, are of necessity obliged to have recourse to them, not being able to gain the Russian frontiers, nor to return home, but by crossing the Kirghiz Steppes ; where the traveller, without guide and defence, is continually exposed to the danger of being pillaged and assassinated, or of dying from thirst.

Before the submission of the Kirghiz to Russia, or rather before the establishment of the line of Orenburg, the Bokharis and Khivians usually traded to Astrakan, where they arrived by sea, on the eastern shore of the Caspian, chiefly from Manghichlak, where they left their camels. Besides, the Bokharis sometimes sent their caravans even into Siberia. Siberia, I may here re mark, signifies the east, sun-rise, or day break ; and the word sibiri in the east is used with either of these meanings. At first sight, it seems that this last cir cumstance ought to facilitate commerce, and benefit the people who receive the price of these transports ; and, much more the merchants who, without it, would"], [479, "443 MERCANTILE OPERATIONS. find themselves obliged to traverse immense deserts upon their own camels, and would meet upon their way numerous and for midable obstacles ; but a further examina tion shows us, that the assistance of the Kirghiz is, for the merchants of High Asia, a source still more productive of difficul ties, obstacles, and losses. In 1820, and the two following years, the Kirghiz charged eighty or one hundred rubles (ten-pence each) for a camel going from Orenburg to Bokhara ; and from fifty five to eighty, from Orenburg to Khiva. The first difficulties for the merchants, after having made their bargain and com menced their journey, arise from their having no right to regulate the march of the caravan, nor to meddle with the mea sures or dispositions. Of these, whatever they may be, the conductors now become"], [480, "444 CARAVAN MOVEMENTS. absolute masters. The Kirghiz choose the direction of the route, regulate the days for halting, the encampment for the night, the moments of repose, and obey none but the caravan-bashee, or chief, who himself sometimes meets with resistance and contradiction from them. Thinking much less of the means for short ening the journey than of their own busi ness, they usually try to conduct the cara van by their settlements, where they can, without expense, lay in a fresh stock of provisions : there they repose for some days, and in case of need, change such of their camels as are fatigued, or on whose service they cannot reckon. This custom has determined certain directions for the routes, and has given them different names : one is called the Tchoumakei, because it passes through the districts of that tribe."], [481, "445 RISKS OF THE MERCHANTS. The indispensable necessity of following the routes which the guides thus choose, and the loss of time during the journey, are still nothing compared to the risks to which the merchants in the Steppes are exposed. There they are stopped by some formidable chief, who makes an arbitrary demand for their right of way across his pasturage ; and he menaces them, in case of refusal, with the retention of all their goods. Further on, they meet a chief who summons them, and threatens them : elsewhere they find a troop of armed bri gands, who, either through a feud with the guides, or urged by the love of plunder, make a sudden attack, and conduct them selves with the greatest ferocity.

The caravans, in case of discord and revenge, being considered as the property of the guides, fall victims to the hatred which is borne to them, or to the reprisals which are to be made from them. The Russian governor of Orenburg, Nep lovief, demanded of a chief the reason for pillaging a caravan. He replied, that he did so because it passed not through his settlements, but those of his enemy. M. Levchine finishes by remarking, that Russia has employed many and mild means for the purpose of putting an end to these violences and brigandages ; but all have remained ineffectual ; and experience has shown, that whilst the Kirghiz keep their rapacious inclinations, and are not restrained by force (a main armee), the commerce of the Russians with Central"], [483, "447 ADVANTAGES GAINED BY RUSSIA. Asia cannot prosper. This truth is the fruit of a hundred years of experience and observation. The Russian Government, conformably to the conclusion of M.

Russian commerce may promise itself the greatest advantages from this measure. After the details which are here epito mized, I think, with all deference, that M.

It is probable that Russia has long enter tained the idea of invading the Oasis of Khiva; and, speaking independently of their motives for undertaking the expe dition, that the present force has been marched at this juncture in order to coun terbalance the check which her diplomacy has so lately received in Afghanistan, and of maintaining an imposing position in the eyes of the inhabitants of Asia. We learn from M. Levchine, that Russia has long been in possession of most accurate infor mation regarding the countries of which he treats, of the routes through them, and of"], [485, "449 OBJECTS OF RUSSIA. their geography, geology, climate, soil, pro ductions, and capabilities. But we may fairly suppose, that no Russian, or other conseiller d'etat, can publish all he knows ; and, therefore, largely as we are in debted to M. Levchine, it is probable that he has kept back a great deal of valuable political information, for which we have no right to inquire. At the same time, so interesting are his materials, so masterly and comprehensive his arrange ment, and so opportune the time of publi cation, that we run considerable risk of being allured into the belief, that Russia, by invading Khiva, has no ulterior views beyond the extension of her com merce, or the manumission of her enslaved subjects.

Although it may be remarked, that, with twenty-three million of serfs, she might as well have commenced the work of liberation a little nearer home. From all the accounts, then, that we can collect of these countries, we may fairly infer, that a Russian army has no ordinary difficulties to contend with, in attempting to cross the Steppes of Central Asia. Every precaution has, of course, been taken that could contribute to her success ; and a communication, for the purposes of co operation and assistance, will, no doubt, be kept up with the shores of the Cas pian.

I should think it most likely that their feuds will be set aside, and that, assisted and stimulated by the Bokharis, they will unite as in a common cause against a common invader. There are no Mussulmen so strict as the inha- bitants of Bokhara, and none who would fight so desperately in defence of their religion. Sir Alexander Burnes has called it the centre of Islam, and says that they have twenty thousand cavalry. I have heard from the natives themselves that their force is much larger. The Turkoman is not so zealous in his faith; but, being a Suni Mahomedan, finds it convenient to have a religious feud with the Persians, who are Shiahs, because it yields him a pretext for carrying off, enslaving, and con verting them. The Kirghiz, who have but a confused idea of the religion of the Pro phet, might gladly avail themselves of a similar pretext ; and, at the united instiga- g g 2"], [488, "452 KIRGHIZ LOVE OF PLUNDER. tion ofthe Bokharis and the Turkomans, and the still more powerful exhortations of their own sorcerers, or Baksy, (those ofthe grand horde of the Kirghiz ride on wrhite horses, and gallop over the plains like persons pos sessed,) would combine in a religious war against the Infidels. The love of plunder alone would excite them to attack, as the Kirghiz display an avarice and cupidity which is quite extraordinary. Their pri soners say, that they have seen them tear the smallest trifle in pieces ; and that their ignorance and determination to have a share is so inflexible, that if they got possession of a watch, they would break it up, and one would carry off a wheel, another a screw, another a hand, and another a spring.

Sir John Mc Neill once told me, in Persia, an anecdote related amongst the Turkomans, which is very characteristic. The owner of a very superior young horse saw a man in the act of galloping off with him. He immediately gave chase, but was surprised at his nearing him, because he knew that the horse he rode himself was far inferior in speed. He observed, how ever, that his favourite animal was impeded by his trappings ; and, sooner than see him beaten, even under such circumstances, the owner, acting on the impulse of the mo ment, called out to the robber, and told him he was a fool for not cutting the parti cular rope that hampered him !

How ever gross may be the manners of the Kir ghiz beauties, they will only allow this liberty to those whom they like ; they other wise contrive to keep their partner at a dis tance, by their quickness in turning, or blows of the whip if necessary. The best Kirghiz horses are always used for battle. Space is measured in the Steppes by time, by the sight and the hearing. When they wish to speak of a great extent they talk of so many days ; and what part of a day it occupies to accomplish it on horse back, or on a camel.

The goodness of their sight is ad mirable ; they distinguish in the plain little objects at the distance of ten versts (seven and a half miles) or more ; and where an European, with good eyes, would only dis tinguish mere points, the Kirghiz recognize the form and colour of objects. Every Kirghiz, in setting out on a jour ney, fastens to his saddle a bag of kroute, a cheese made from sour milk. He soaks some of it in water, and thus appeases his hunger and thirst together. When going against an enemy he sews behind him, on his outer garment, one or two little bags, containing written prayers, which are sup posed to give him courage, and preserve him from illness and wounds. The Kirghiz Kazaks fight with the lance, the sabre, arrows, the matchlock, and the tchakane, a kind of hatchet ; and, for"], [492, "456 STRENGTH OF THE KIRGHIZ. defensive armour, wear a coat of mail, and sometimes a helmet. The powder they make is very bad, as they are ignorant of the proportions of its ingredients. They also make a kind which is white. A Kirghiz, says M. Levchine, remains easily a whole day without drinking, and two without eating ; so that, upon the first opportunity, he eats enormously. As a proof of his strength of body, he adds, that a Kirghiz ties a sheep to his saddle, and gallops between two rows of spectators. Those who wish to try their strength ought to tear off the legs of the wretched animal, whilst he is thus dragged along at full speed. The Kirghiz does not fight for war, but for pillage ; and, therefore, a compact front or square of good infantry will resist a mass of Kirghiz ten times more numerous.

Trembling with fear at the sight of a gun, they collect themselves in face of the muzzle, trying to hide one behind the other, and the ball pierces a long file of them. A cara van, which was pillaged as it was going to Bokhara, defended itself a long time against these bandits by means of the fun nel or pipe of the Russian copper kettle, placed upon a camel, which the aggres sors took for a small cannon, or falconet. They took flight two or three times, per ceiving that a cunning fellow was point ing the pipe towards them.

They then display all their valour ; but, in case of non-success, they lose it as soon, and gain the open plain with the greatest cow ardice. If they are dismounted, and obliged to fight on foot, it is all up with them. Sometimes, nevertheless, they do a great deal of harm to the bravest adversaries, by carrying off their horses upon the slightest negligence, by cutting off their convoys in case of a division of forces, and, if they can, by making prisoners of the sentinels of the advanced posts, by means of their arkanes or cords.

I think we may expect to hear that the Russians have met with numerous difficul ties, have undergone many privations and fatigues, arising from natural obstacles alone, and have sustained considerable loss of baggage, camels, cattle, and camp equipage, either by abandonment or foray : that they are kept in a constant state of watchfulness and excitement, by the harass ing and nightly attacks and demonstrations of the Turkomans, who are a far more for midable enemy than the Kirghiz ; and that their own Cossack troops, whom they will doubtless oppose to them, will not be able to meet them on equal terms ; the deserts being at once their home, their shelter, and a fortress from which they cannot be ex pelled.

M. Levchine, however, speaking of the plains which extend towards the Oust-Ourt, after adverting to their com plete sterility, remarks, that in summer and autumn there is no place more disadvan tageous, even for Nomade tribes ; but that in winter, the Kirghiz find there many conveniences ; and that the rushy places, which cover the plain like forests, serve first, as a rampart against winds and hurricanes (bouranes) : secondly, as pastu rage for cattle : thirdly, instead of fire-"], [497, "461 AND NATURE OF THE SOIL. wood. The Russians have thus probably been stopped by a winter of unusual se verity. M. Levchine adds, that the Oust- Ourt is remarkable for the rigour of its climate ; that thirty degrees of Reaumur appear nothing extraordinary ; and that the snow lies there from two to three feet in thickness. However desirable may be the approach of spring, it is far from being without its disadvantages as a season for marching. Immediately upon the melting of the snows, the paths are crossed by resistless torrents, and the numerous ravines are turned into water-courses. Lieut. Conolly has remarked, vol. i. p. 144, the \" Caspian desert is generally of a light soil, white and inclined to be sandy, yet so firm, that in dry weather camels barely leave the print of their feet upon it.\""], [498, "462 THE SEASONS. A dry sand affords a secure footing to a camel, but that animal, when laden, walks so insecurely upon a moistened and slip pery soil, (to say nothing of the additional fatigue in consequence of forced marches,) that he is always in danger of falling, even upon level ground ; and the injury he often receives is of such a nature, that it is cha rity to put him to death. To the spring, which appears suddenly, and passes away rapidly, succeeds a dry and burning sum mer. The Russian force from Mangichlak and Orenburg has been estimated, I know not with what accuracy, at thirty-two thou sand men. The distance, by M.

Those of an army would, I suppose, be much less. The inhabitants of Khiva, including the Turkomans, are estimated by M.

Supposing, that at any future period she should march upon Bokhara, she would, I think, meet with a desperate resistance, ere she could enter the holy city ; but there is no doubt, that with a large force, properly organized at Khiva, she could soon make herself mistress of it. But as, according to her manifesto, its conquest is not her im mediate object, she will, nevertheless, find herself in a position to increase her in fluence as much as she pleases.

But Persia is already too much be-Russian ized, and will now, moreover, feel really grateful to Russia for her chastisement of her enemies, the Khivians, and disposed perhaps to grant her some additional boon : the bazaars of every city, north of the Hindu Kosh, will be flooded more than ever, with Russian manufactures : the in terests of the Uzbegs of Kunduz, the Bok haris, the Kokanis, (said to be nearly, if not quite, as powerful as the Bokharis,) and those of the Chinese in Yarkund, who, as I have been informed, are constantly quarrelling, if not at open war, with the Hh2"], [504, "468 SPECULATIONS IN CASE Kokanis, can be played off against each other.

APPENDIX. \" Mahmud of Ghuzni marched thence across the de sert, in his way to Guzerat and Somnath.\" \u2014 p. 25. Rumzan, 415 ; October, 1024. In the middle of the month of Rumzan, the Mo- hamedan army reached the city of Multan, and as a great desert lay before them, the king gave orders for the troops to provide themselves with several days' water and provisions, as also with provender for their horses, besides which, twenty thousand camels were laden with supplies. Having passed the desert, the army reached the city of Ajmeer. Here, finding the Rajah and inhabitants had abandoned the place, rather than submit to him, Mahmud ordered it to be sacked, and the adjacent country to be laid waste. Conceiving the reduction of the fort of Ajmeer would occupy too much time, he left it unmolested ; and proceeding on his expedition, took by assault some smaller forts on the road, till at length he arrived at Nehrwala, a frontier city of Guzerat, which was evacuated on his approach. Mahmud, taking the same precautions as before, by"], [510, "474 APPENDIX. rapid marches, reached Somnath without opposition. Here he saw a fortification on a narrow peninsula, washed on three sides by the sea, on the battlements of which appeared a vast host of people in arms, who, making a signal for a herald to approach, they pro claimed to him that their great idol, Somnath, had drawn the Mohamedans thither to blast them in a moment, and to revenge the destruction of the gods of India. In the morning, the Mohamedan troops advancing to the walls, began the assault. The battlements were in a short time cleared by the archers, and the Hindus, as tonished and dispirited, crowded into the temple, and prostrating themselves in tears before the idol, prayed for assistance. The Mohamedans, having seized this opportunity, applied their scaling ladders and mounted the walls, shouting aloud, \" Alia Akber ' ! \" The Hin dus, urged by despair, returned to the defence of the works, and made so spirited a resistance, that the Mo hamedans, unable to retain their footing, and wearied with fatigue, fell back on all sides, and were at length obliged to retire. Next morning the action was re newed, but as fast as the besiegers scaled the walls, so fast were they hurled down headlong by the besieged, who now seemed resolved to defend the place to the last. Thus the labours of the second day proved even more unsuccessful than those of the first. On the third day, an army of idolaters having arrived to reinforce the garrison, presented itself in order of battle in sight of the Ghuzni camp. This man\u0153uvre did not escape the king, who secured some boats left in a neighbouring creek, manned 1 The war-cry of the Moslems, \" God is Great !\""], [511, "475 APPENDIX. them with rowers and some of his best troops, and pur sued the enemy ; on which occasion, he took and sunk some of their flotilla, while a part only escaped. Having now placed guards round the walls and at the gates, Mahmud entered Somnath, accompanied by his sons and a few of his nobles, and principal attendants. On ap proaching the temple, he saw a superb edifice built of hewn-stone ; its lofty roof was supported by fifty-six pillars curiously carved, and set with precious stones. In the centre of the hall was Somnath, a stone idol, five yards in height, two of which were sunk in the ground. The king, approaching the image, raised his mace and struck off its nose. He ordered two pieces of the idol to be broken off, and sent to Ghuzni, that one might be thrown at the threshold of the public mosque, and the other at the court door of his own palace. These iden tical fragments are to this day, (now six hundred years ago,) to be seen at Ghuzni. Two more fragments were reserved to be sent to Mecca and Medina. It is a well authenticated fact, that when Mahmud was thus em ployed in destroying this idol, a crowd of Brahmins petitioned his attendants, and offered a quantity of gold if the king would desist from further mutilation. His officers endeavoured to persuade him to accept of the money ; for they said that breaking one idol would not do away with idolatry altogether ; that, therefore, it could serve no purpose to destroy the image entirely ; but that such a sum of money given in charity among true believers, would be a meritorious act. The king acknowledged there might be reason in what they said, but replied, that if he should consent to such a measure, his name would be handed down to posterity, as \" Mah- 12"], [512, "476 APPENDIX. mud the idol seller,\" whereas he was desirous of being known as \" Mahmud the destroyer :\" he therefore di rected the troops to proceed in their work. The next blow broke open the belly of Somnath, which was hol low, and discovered a quantity of diamonds, rubies, and pearls, of much greater value than the amount which the Brahmins had offered. Mahmud determined to prevent this attempt to raise the siege, and having ordered a party to keep the garrison in check, himself engaged the enemy in the field. The battle raged with great fury : victory was long doubtful, till two Indian princes, Brahma Dew and Dabishleem, with other reinforcements, joined their countrymen during the action, and inspired them with fresh courage. Mahmud, at this moment perceiving his troops to waver, leaped from his horse, and pros trating himself before God ', implored his assistance. Then mounting again, he took Abul Hussun, the Cir cassian, (one of his generals,) by the hand, by way of encouragement, and advanced on the enemy. At the same time, he cheered his troops with such energy, that, ashamed to abandon their king, with whom they had so often fought and bled, they, with one accord, gave a loud shout and rushed forwards. In this charge the Moslems broke through the enemy's lines, and laid five thousand Hindus dead at their feet. The rout became general. The garrison of Somnath, beholding this de feat, abandoned the defence of the place, and issuing out at a gate towards the sea, to the number of four thou- 1 This mode of inspiring his troops, so often mentioned hy the writers of the age, is extremely characteristic of the nature of the wars waged hy Mahmud of Ghuzni in India."], [513, "477 APPENDIX. sand, embarked in boats, intending to proceed to the island of Serendeep, or Ceylon. \" The ruins of a large city called Zohaka.\" \u2014 p. 109.

It is interesting to inquire into the reasons why Alexander, wishing to reach Bactria, did not march thither directly from Persia, without taking the trouble to go so far out of his way in order to cross by Bamian. But when he was on his way thither by the nearer road, he was suddenly recalled by the intelligence of a revolt at Artac\u00e6na, the capital city of Aria, which reached him at Susa.

The Empress Catherine, Joseph IT. of Austria, Abd-ul-Hamed the Caliph of Turkey, the rival Khans of Krim-Tatary, Selim and Chahym, Prince Potemkin, Sovorotf, are among the characters which figure in the exciting scenes here displayed, all pictured with historic verisimilitude, and placed in attitudes to keep attention alive, while over them all towers Elijah Mansour, the high-priest, prophet, and chieftain, of the chivalric tribes of the Caucasus, by whom his memory is warmly cherished to this day, and whose name is still, as long may it be, the rallying cry to arms in that land of mountains, which still proves, as in the days of Catherine, 'the Russian soldier's grave.' The warlike songs with which the work is interspersed, correspond with those yet sung by the heroic mountaineers, who successfully defy the Autocrat of all the Russias with all his millions, and are, incomparably, the best we have lately met with. We think some of them scarcely inferior to Byron's spirit-stirring Albanian war song \u2014 ' Tambourgi ! Tambourgi ! thy 'larum afar.'\" \u2014 Conservative Journal. \" It would occupy some columns to give anything like a digest of the story, which is made throughout subservient to the exhibition of character, and the narration of historical facts. This work will repay perusal \u2014 nay, reward study. It is not one to be lightly read, or carelessly thrown aside, but may be regarded as a valuable picture of the policy, manners, and customs of the time and place. With many of the poetical mottoes to the various chapters we are unacquainted, they are frequently of great beauty, and are, we presume, from the pen of Mr. Spencer.\" \u2014 Sunday Times. \" For the production of such a work, abilities are required of the highest order, and acquirements of the most rare and varied description. The number of those who have made the attempt and failed, is sufficient to convince us how many diffi culties attend success. That Mr. Spencer should have succeeded so well in this, the highest branch of fictitious literature, increases the high opinion we entertained of his talents on the first publication of his ' Travels in Circassia.'\" In three vols. post 8vo.
