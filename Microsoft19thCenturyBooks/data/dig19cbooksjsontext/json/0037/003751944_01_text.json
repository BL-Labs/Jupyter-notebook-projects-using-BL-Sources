So, we think of our grief for a friend taken from us years ago ; from which we have long since recovered, but which, past as it is, has left a shade on our character which would not have been there if we had not lost him. It is a great mistake to speak of the past as of something no longer to be taken into account \u2014 which does not signify, be cause it is past \u2014 which is over and done with. It is never over in one sense. It is part of ourselves ; it stays by us as long as we hve.

She did not even know that she looked young ;"], [21, "AGNES VALMAR. 11 for though she often heard friends say she might be taken for eighteen, the remark made no impression whatever upon her.

And so she was, in one sense : for the experience of life's sorrows had come upon her when she was still a child, and she had become a woman all at once \u2014 in a day, as it were ; \u2014 and the child's features, and caressing, winning ways, and artless, expansive, overflowing heart, had not changed, but only acquired a superadded impress of thoughtfulness and feeling, which such a young face seldom wears.

Her mental exterior \u2014 if I may be for given an expression, at first hearing, seemingly contradictory \u2014 exhibited the same characteristics. Of her physical exterior, at this present date, I do not intend to say more than may be gathered from what I have said aheady. But long ago, before she had known care, when she was free and happy as the young birds carolling outside my window there, those who knew her called her sweetly pretty; and said, that if ab solute beauty was not hers, there was a heavenliness in her expression, a play of countenance, an animation of manner, an attractive charm about almost everything she said and did, which all hearts acknow-"], [23, "13 AGNES VALMAR. ledged, and of wliich she alone remained unconscious.

At least, in after-days \u2014 though she knew and thought nothing about all this at the time \u2014 when she looked back upon that shadowless period, she could not recollect anybody who had not seemed always glad to see her; who had not spoken to her kindly, and looked at her approvingly."], [24, "14 AGNES VALMAR.

Agnes's father had died while she was yet an infant ; and two sis ters had been lost, also, in very early child hood. Her mother, and one brother, many years older than herself, were the only treasures she had left ; and on them her young affections had been all concen trated. How entirely she loved them!

But they wandered not abroad ; they centred in her family and home, and there they made a heaven. There she was adored. Her gentle presence diffused warmth and hght and comfort, wherever it came, like the sun in May.

During the interval, however, Agnes's unceasing kindness and attention, had won upon the old man's heart and confidence : aU he had seen of her, before and since his illness, had excited his unqualified esteem and respect : his chUd's clinging affection to her, and her own tender attachment and care in return, had struck aU the chords of a father's love. When he felt he was dying, the most earnest wish of his soul was, that his chUd should not lose the inestimable advantage of her watchful af fection. He asked and obtained her con sent, and Mr. Landor's, to her acting as sole guardian of his orphan boy, and as his executrix and trustee.

Por the present, however, the smallness of httle Walter's expectations in this re spect, interfered neither with his happi ness in Agnes, nor with hers in him. Pos sible future difficulties or disappointments, did not trouble the even current of their mutual and entire love. Already, and ere Agnes yet had lost, by death, the mother and brother who had once been aU in aU to her \u2014 divided, nevertheless, from them, in so many ways, as she now was, and lone in heart though surrounded \u2014 the child had been to her a Heaven- descended blessing ; a spring of comfort and of hope which nothing else on earth, circum stanced as she was, and with the character"], [50, "40 AGNES VALMAR. of mind and heart she possessed, could have afforded her. When the objects of her first and deepest affections were taken from her to the tomb, it, alone, saved her heart from breaking. Henceforward it was her life \u2014 her world.

Woe ! \u2014 Woe ! for those who have owned \u2014 who have loved \u2014 who have lost ! If Agnes found her crumbling happi ness once more becoming safely grounded, even on this seemingly fragUe foundation ; her little Walter,, on his side, knew none that was not buUt on her. In the wide house, she, only, was his unvarying, tender friend ; the originator, the partaker of aU his joys ; the unfailing sympathiser in aU his little griefs ; the being to whose will ing, indulgent ear he confided, as he grew in years and intelhgence, aU his fresh springing, teeming thoughts, aU his con flicting feelings ; to whose approval alone"], [52, "42 AGNES VALMAR. he looked, for encouragement in toU, for support in trial, for reward in aU weU doing.

This was the age at which his father had wished he should embark in some pro fession or employment, by means of which alone, with his limited means, he conceived he could exist, and retain the society and habits of gentlemen. Long since, his guardian, Agnes, had taken measures to secure, if possible, this desired object ; by engaging the interest in Walter's favour, of almost the only remaining old and sin cere friend of his father's, who was so circumstanced as to have it in his power to assist.

With him, she wore ever a smUe on her hp ; and hearty, encouraging words, were the only ones that met his ear. Walter's situation was as yet in Great Britain ; that, at least, was some consolation : and for a few months as yet, he would not be required to enter on its temporary duties.

StiU, she had hved near him now so long ; his face, his voice were so familiar to her ; her own disposition was so forgiving, so clinging, so affectionate : She had so yearned often and often to find, or to make, in him, what she had fondly thought to find when she married, \u2014 to be able to love, to trust, to respect, to look up to him, as it is"], [89, "AGNES VALMAR. 79 the joy and pride of every true, pure, noble woman's heart to do to her husband : She had so perseveringly hoped, by time and caution and gentleness and blameless hfe, to win him sooner or later to become her staff and light : Latterly too \u2014 as increas ing age and impaired health threw him more with her \u2014 she had so joyfully dreamed she saw signs at length of this blessed clearing of the path before her : \u2014 When the whole sad, chequered tale was closed, thus awfully, by his sudden death, Agnes felt the blow as deeply as many and many a whe who has led a hfe of un interrupted tender intercourse with the husband of her choice.

It is a dreary thing, that independent life ; when the independence has its source in the privation of domestic ties; in the absence of beings to regard and to be in fluenced by, or whose happiness can be influenced by you or by your acts ! Agnes had another strangeness too to undergo.

She had written to Walter several times, before Mr. Landor's sudden end; but the length of the voyage the former had to undertake, and of that of the re turning vessel which might bring news of him, being so great; she did not hear again from him tiU long after all these events we have been detailing, were over, and she had for some months been settled in her new abode.

She had, too, been prepared for this long sUence, by Walter's letter on leaving England ; in which he told her that his ship was not expected to touch anywhere on the way out. In the same letter he had entreated her forgiveness, in touching terms, for having started without further communication with her ; assuring her \u2014 which she in no way doubted \u2014 that he had acted so, to spare the feelings of both, and especially hers. He thought they would be less tried thus, than by letters or further meetings, during the interval of his unavoidable stay. Por a long whUe after Mr. Landor's death, Agnes was, on her side, sUent.

When she did, the same indefinable feeling deterred her from re ferring in express terms, whether by relation or otherwise, to her husband's death ; or to the other changes that had subsequently taken place in her own life. It was not that she had any intention of keeping these secret from Walter. It never occurred to her but that he must become aware within due time (whether through the newspapers, through his ac quaintances at home or abroad, or other wise) of aU that had happened : and taking this for granted, \u2014 whUe the tone of her letters indirectly bore the impress of the recent events, and whUe her date of course indicated her change of abode, and she"], [96, "86 AGNES VALMAR. spoke of her occupations there simply and naturally \u2014 yet the fact was, she never directly stated what had brought her there, and whether her residence there was other than temporary ; or made explicit refer ence to her altered condition.

Happy as this would have made her in her now solitary state, she seemed to feel less able, of her own accord, to urge it now, than she would have been whUe her husband hved. She could not bear to appear to influence him, in that which, if done at aU, she desired should be the result of his own unprompted feel ings and wish. The consequence was, as it chanced, that Walter remained Ions; in total ignorance of all that had passed; conceiving Agnes's abode in Dorsetshire to be a mere visit to"], [97, "AGNES VALMAR. 87 the sea for change of ah ; and attributing her more than usuaUy subdued tone, to some temporary weakness of health, and, thence, depression of spirits. Concerning these, he expressed himself, in his replies, anxiously and affectionately; and, for that very reason, in a way which failed to open Agnes's eyes as to the state of ignorance regarding her, in which he reaUy was ; but gave her, on the contrary, the impression, that he was aware of aU, but thought it really kindest and most delicate to refrain from doing more than thus glance \u2014 as she conceived it \u2014 at the painful subject.

CHAPTEB V. While a year and more was going over both theh heads, each remaining under the misconception described, with regard to the other ; a change was on the point of breaking on Agnes's fortunes beyond any that the wUdest imagination could antici pate even in its dreams. As Agnes was walking by herself one morning on the shingles of the sea-shore immediately beneath her little cottage, (which stood apart, some quarter of a nule"], [100, "90 AGNES VALMAR. outside the vUlage in the vicinity of which it was situated) she was startled by the sudden rush towards her of a seemingly infuriated or frightened horse, bearing an old man on his back, who was struggling in vain to restrain or at least to guide him.

The old man's illness was long, his con valescence slow.

There was some other hidden reason too \u2014 as many things made plain \u2014 in addition to his gratitude, for this full measure of tender attachment towards her.

In addition to this, time and her own kind offices, had attached her sin- cerely to the good, patient, tender-hearted old man.

She knew, however, also, that the susceptibility and backwardness of the pride wliich belonged to his character too, woidd render the steps towards this comparative eminence distastefiU, nay painful to him : and she felt convinced, that in paving the way for him, as far as it was in her power to do ;"], [119, "AGNES VALMAR. 109 by winning first in her own person the de sired rank and consideration, which would, through her, become to himseh so much more rapid and easy of attainment, \u2014 she would be doing him a real and essential service.

Acting under these convictions and im pidses, Agnes determined not to breathe a word to Walter of the wondrous change that had taken place in her fortunes, until she had attained her object, and that he came back : resolving, if he did not bend his steps homewards when the proper time came, to take measures to bring him, with out divulging her secret."], [121, "AGNES VALMAR. 111 CHAPTEB VI.

Great, doubtless, were the wonder and curiosity, the interest of various kinds, which attached in the minds of all the gossiping world, to the fortunes past and future, and to the person of one, who appeared thus suddenly among them, re commended by such powerful sources of attraction. In one respect, however, they were disappointed ; namely, in piercing the veU wliich enveloped Agnes's past. One of the requirements of her princely benefactor's will, had been that she should take his name : and the first thing VOL. I. I"], [124, "114 AGNES VALMAR. Agnes attended to, was the fulfilment of the forms necessary to carry this legaUy into effect. At that time, both she and he whose name she took, opulent as he was, were entirely unknown to fame. The old man, though a gentleman in mind and by education, was of humble parentage; and had early quitted England for the East : leaving few who knew him ; and recognised by none when he revisited her shores. Combined unwearying industry, extraordinary ability and prudence, and almost unparaUeled good luck ; had reared for him towards the end of his life, in foreign lands, the colossal fortune, which subsequently descended, in so singular a manner, on Agnes's unconscious, unpre tending head. He had married abroad, and had had one child \u2014 a daughter \u2014 in giving birth to whom his wife had died."], [125, "115 AGNES VALMAR. The chUd had been for years the charm and aim of his existence; and when she too perished in the bloom of early woman hood, the broken-hearted old man would have laid, had he dared, his grey head in the same grave. Listless, and indifferent now to aU that once swayed or interested him ; he wan dered back, alone and unknown, to the sea - bathed county where he had first drawn breath, but where no one now re mained to welcome him. It was on his second visit here (after having, in the interim, placed the immense sums he owned \u2014 not aheady invested in foreign stocks, or locked up in priceless jewels \u2014 in the British funds, and other monied securities) that he encountered Agnes in the manner detaUed ; and found in her, not only the kind preserver of his 12"], [126, "116 AGNES VALMAR. hfe, but also the hving image of his lost chUd.

What followed, we have told. When Agnes, then, first became known and spoken of in the London world, it was not under the name of Landor, but under that of the departed and obscure old man. Subsequently, when the title of Viscountess was accorded her, it was of course stiU his name only that appeared in the Patent and in the new peerage- editions or appendixes. The fact of her ever having borne that of Landor, never reached the circles in which she moved ; and remained unsuspected, equaUy, by those who had been acquainted with her during her married or maiden life."], [128, "118 AGNES VALMAR. Mr. Landor's place was in a remote northern county, where Agnes's mother and she had also lived. Neither had been in the habit of visiting London, nor were they known to any of its habitual fre quenters. Theh neighbours were country abiders like themselves ; and rarely, if ever, wandered to the Modern Babel \u2014 never to mix in its social vortex. Since Mr. Landor's death, and her transplanta tion to Dorsetshire, Agnes had lived a per fectly secluded hfe. The vUlage near wliich she had fixed herseh, was inhabited by its own few humble residents only ; and was no place of resort for birds of passage of any description. She had -visited nobody ; and had seen none there whom she met again, or was likely to meet, in London drawing-rooms or pubhc places. Thus, without intending or dreaming of"], [129, "119 AGNES VALMAR. concealment of any description or on any subject, the fact was, that she was not identified in the mind of any, with her former self; and, after a time, she became sensible of the circumstance. It amused her. The oddity of the case tickled her fancy ; and, once the idea in her mind, she derived much inward diversion from the round-a-bout, awkward attempts she occasionally perceived vulgar-minded peo ple making; for the purpose of eliciting from others, as ignorant on the subject as themselves, particulars of her antecedents previous to her accession of fortune. Once she could scarcely help laughing outright, at overhearing an animated dis cussion on the important point, as to whether the departed Nabob was her uncle or her step-father ; and at finding the dispute settled by the intervention of a"], [130, "120 AGNES VALMAR. third, who declared both disputants were in error, \" for he \u2014 the new-comer \u2014 was weU acquainted with the old gentleman, and knew him, for a fact, to be her brother in-law ; as he had married an elder sister of hers who had died not hah a dozen years ago, and with whom the speaker was a particular favourite '.\" Agnes thought of Merrick's \" Chamehon,\" and was about to burst upon the trio with a quo tation therefrom ; but she recoUected that the Chamehon' s warring champions were all equally right, and the present com batants being all equaUy wrong, she de cided on sparing theh blushes, and con tented herseh with quietly smiling at them aU.

After all, there was something painful to her \u2014 though it had been done for his sake and his sake only \u2014 in being \" Lady Valmar,\" aU at once, to him ! \u2014 in being anything in the world in his eyes, when they first met, but the quiet, simple \" Gardy Agnes\" he had quitted. Since no one seemed to know that Agnes Landor and Lady Valmar were one ; why should he, in the beginning? She would like to bring him to that know ledge by degrees : Not to conceal from him, by any means, the surrounding circumstances of her present hfe ; but"], [132, "122 AGNES VALMAR. to let him attribute them, at first, to any other conjectured combination of events, rather than to her own altered position ; and so suffer him \u2014 at. the Pates' good time \u2014 to discover, himseh, how matters reaUy stood.

So far her httle mystification should go \u2014 no farther. Who and what Lady Valmar was, in other respects not affecting her iden tity with his Agnes, he must have learned long before this, through the daUy papers; which had for months teemed with details regarding her marveUous fortune and her"], [133, "AGNES VALMAR. 123 pubhc acts, and with reports of her move ments here and there, her entertainments, and aU the rest. And when was Walter to return ? When was Agnes once more to have the delight of embracing her long-lost, never-forgotten idol ? Never-forgotten ! \u2014 Ever-cherished ! In seclusion, or in the gay and busy world, \u2014 in poverty or in wealth, \u2014 unknown and unsought, or followed by the adulation of brilliant crowds, \u2014 he, and he alone, had been the subject of her waking and sleeping thoughts : \u2014 that httle far-distant spot where he was, the only point on earth which had value or importance in her eyes. Once mounted to the elevation she had wished, for his sake, to attain ; her anxiety"], [134, "124 AGNES VALMAR. that he should return, grew painfully in tense. StUl, a lingering unwUlingness to call him to her, even now, stayed her hand Avhenever she would have written the decisive words. At this juncture, and when she was abso lutely growing Ul through the effects of the contest within ; a brief, agitated letter from Walter himself, reached her : asking her, in plain terms, whether it were true that Mr. Landor was no more. ' Some expressions in her last letter to him,' he said, ' had caused him for the first time to imagine it. He had made every possible inquiry; had examined every Enghsh paper, of a date subsequent to that of his leaving England, which he could hy any means procure : He could obtain no positive information. But he had found in a \" Times,\" of between one and two years"], [135, "125 AGNES VALMAR. since, an advertisement of the projected sale of Beechwood; which advertisement went on to state, ' that the health of the proprietor \u2014 J. Meecham, Esq. \u2014 obliged him to leave the country.' \u2014 J. Meecham, Esq.!'.! \u2014 Was, then, what Agnes's letter had appeared indirectly to imply, true ? He was distracted with doubt and anxiety, and implored her to let him know the truth instantly.' Agnes was unconscious of having im plied it, or of not having implied it, equaUy. As explained aheady \u2014 though reluctant to volunteer direct information or conversation on the subject, she had never intended, on the other hand, to con ceal it ; and had long been under the im pression that Walter was aware of all. The distance was so great \u2014 letters took so long passing between one country and the"], [136, "126 AGNES VALMAR. other, and were despatched so seldom \u2014 that, with all the love that was in both theh hearts, their communications were unavoidably rare; and that which could have remained but for a very brief while uncertain, under other circumstances, might, under these, long continue so, without there being anything very extra ordinary in the fact. Walter's letter was dated from a place, nearer home by nearly three months' voyage, than that he had dwelt in hitherto. ' He had been sent there,' he said, ' with .another, on some commission of impor tance which would occupy a twelvemonth to execute : Agnes's reply would reach him, therefore, in a couple of months.' Her answer was simple, and to the point : informing him of the facts plainly and quietly ; and stating, at the same time,"], [137, "127 AGNES VALMAR. that she had never thought but that he knew them. With respect to subsequent events, she mentioned nothing : nor did she say a word of his return. If she had felt backward in urging him before ; she felt more so after his letter. She could not think of Massing him in any way ; at aU-events in this reply of hers. She only said she rejoiced at hearing he was not quite so many thousand miles from his native land, and from those that loved him. Her heart would not aUow her to say less than that \u2014 he would surely think she no longer cared for him, if she said less. She gave her address, for future letters, at Lady Valmar's, in Grosvenor-square ; where she said she would be by the time she could hear from him again in return, when the London season would have begun. Though Agnes wrote so quietly, how-"], [138, "128 AGNES VALMAR. ever ; the receipt of this letter perturbed her excessively. A voice from the bottom of her heart would keep whispering \u2014 how ever she tried, or fancied she tried, to rea son against it \u2014 that it was not mere written paper that would come next; but some thing dearer. Walter's own letter bore too decided traces of emotion, for her to be able to prevent the perpetual recurrence of this idea, of this hope \u2014 for hope it was, oh ! so intense ! yet subdued, restrained. If she gave it full vent, and he came not \u2014 how would she bear it ! No, she must try not to hope ; not to think Of it at aU ; to imagine all the possible opposing cir cumstances ; to comfort herseh by the re flection that, at the worst, it would be only delay; for at any moment she had the power, by a word, to bring bim home to opulence, consideration and honour."], [139, "AGNES VALMAR. 129 Nevertheless, the idea that he would come without that word, spite of aU efforts to stifle it, occupied her night and day : and weeks before he could possibly, if he waited for her answer, arrive in England, she was aheady estabhshed at her town house ; surprising the fashionable world by her appearance there before the season had well begun. During this interval, Agnes had time to read her own heart better than she had ever done before ; or rather, to suffer for the first time thoughts and feehngs to enter there, which never found \u2014 never could have found \u2014 a place in it, under pre-existing circumstances : \u2014 She was so entirely her own mistress now ! \u2014 without one tie or duty to interfere with her exclu sive attachment to Walter !

Proceeding without a moment's delay to London, and there merely aUowing him seh time to cast off his travel-stained ha biliments, he hastened to the \" Lady Val mar's house\" which had been indicated to him ; and where he concluded that Agnes was passing the season, on a visit to the rich and fashionable \u2014 and, as report said, accomphshed, high-minded, and amiable \u2014 Lioness of the day. How the quiet, retired Agnes Landor, had come to know one so \"repandue,\" and now so high-placed; Walter did not trouble himseh to inquire. He presumed"], [144, "134 AGNES VALMAR. they had accidentaUy met in Dorsetshire, whence the newspapers stated that this new worldly wonder had emerged. That the latter should hke, and dehght in, Agnes \u2014 once knowing her ; and should wish to keep her near her, and to serve her perhaps ; was quite natural, and to be expected, in Walter's mind. He only hoped her residence there would not prove an interference to the frequency and privacy and familiarity of theh inter course ; and that her association with per sons of habits and ideas so different from those of the few she had mixed with hitherto, would not .alter the native love liness and simplicity of her character : \u2014 but of this last he had little fear. With a beating heart, early on the morning of his arrival, Walter walked to Grosvenor-square ; and knocking at the"], [145, "135 AGNES VALMAR. number named to him, inquired for Mrs. Landor. Agnes of course had anticipated, that ff he came, this must necessarily be ; and had therefore warned her Porter accordingly. This Porter was an ancient man of the old school; such as can rarely be met with now-a-days, at-aU-events in London houses. He had lived in the country ah his life, tiU a few months before he entered Lady Valmar's service : when he had come up to town with his old master, whom he had served as own man, since he was a boy ; and had loved with the sincere, faithful attachment, which such servants sometimes feel for employers who are kind to them and value them in return. Agnes, on her first entrance into London life, had become acquainted, on closely intimate and friendly terms, with the"], [146, "136 AGNES VALMAR. famUy of the venerable nobleman, Grif fiths' s former master; and had seen and heard much concerning the worthy, ho nest old man. When his master's un expected death of a fever, soon after deprived him of his place; and flung him \u2014 friendless, bewUdered and utterly dispirited \u2014 upon the world again in his declining years ; Agnes was delighted to offer him a home with her, which * she promised herseh should prove \u2014 if it coidd not make up to him for the loss of the master he had really loved \u2014 at least as easy, and otherwise happy a one, as that he had lost. Poor Griffiths was too glad to accept the offer ; for aheady Agnes's pleasant, winning manners, and the high esteem and regard in which he had perceived she was held by his master's famUy, had"], [147, "AGNES VALMAR. 137 disposed him warmly towards her : and when she told him, that, if he entered her service, he should never leave it whUe he hved; and that he should meet from her \u2014 what she knew he merited \u2014 not the forbearance merely of an indif- ferent, careless mistress, but the regard and trust of a friend; the poor, dejected old man burst into tears, and bade God bless her; saying she had comforted his heart, which he thought was well nigh broken, and that he would serve her faithfully and honestly, whUe he could speak or stand. And so he did : And the affectionate nature which had now no other object on which to spend itself, soon impeUed him to love and take pride in his sweet, indulgent, kind-faced young mistress (for young she seemed at-aU-events to him;)"], [148, "138 AGNES VALMAR. almost as he had before loved and taken pride in the exceUent master near whom his former hfe had been passed. Though, on account of his age and failing strength, not assigned other definite duties than those of Porter ; he was, in reality, Lady Valmar's most confidential servant, and entrusted to a great degree with the general management of her London household. There was nothing awkward, or strange, or unfitting, therefore, \u2014 on the time ap proaching when Walter might arrive \u2014 in Agnes's acquainting old Griffiths how she thought it probable a ward of hers whom she had brought up, and who had gone abroad before she became Lady Valmar and was unaware of the change, might be returning home to her about this time; and might ask for her"], [149, "139 AGNES VALMAR. by her former name of Mrs. Landor : Or in her acknowledging to him, fur ther, that she wished to enjoy the plea sure of her ward's surprise when he found out the circumstances ; and that, therefore it was her desire he should not be made acquainted, directly or indirectly, by Griffiths or any of the other domestics, with her change of name ; but be shown up without a remark. She added; that, of course, the mention not of the facts only, but of her title or present name at aU, in her ward \u2014 Mr. Maldon' s \u2014 presence, was (in accordance with this desire) to be avoided by aU tUl she specified to the contrary. Thus matters stood, when Walter knocked at Lady Valmar's lofty door, and inquired if Mrs. Landor were at home. Griffiths, sUently bowing assent,"], [150, "140 AGNES VALMAR. admitted him at once ; and merely in quiring his name for form's sake, de sired a footman to show the gentleman up-stairs.

This was in deed a trivial incident. It was unavoid able that such should occasionaUy, \u2014 fre quently \u2014 happen, circumstanced as she was : but he was distressed at it never theless.

Next day, she proposed a trip to Lady Valmar's principal country place \u2014 Val mar, \u2014 where she said ' the proprietress was not staying now, and which she was anxious to show to Walter.' \" Anywhere, with her, was agreeable to him.\" A railway carried them to within a few mUes when a carriage from Valmar met them : and they spent a delightful day,"], [165, "AGNES VALMAR. 155 wandering through the dehcious grounds, and over the romantic hUls and glens which the park enclosed ; or exploring aU the beauties and mysteries of the noble and exquisitely tasty mansion.

The gardens were glowing with many- coloured crocus, anemones, Daphnes, early tulips and heaths, and every other flower that opens its brilliant bosom to the day, at this period. \" What a heavenly place,\" said Walter ; \"What a paradise on earth, such a spot would be \u2014 with you !\" \" Do you think so ?\" answered Agnes. And she looked so pleased, and smUed aU the wlhle so strangely, he could not help asking what was in her thoughts.

The stipulations were not rehshed ; but they were acceded to. When Walter arrived and had had time to look around him, he perceived Agnes at the other end of the room he was in, surrounded by several persons, two of whom he recognised to be men of the very highest rank, and aU of whom appeared to bear themselves to wards her with marked consideration, attention and deference.

As he watched, he saw more of these, with an indefinite number of others unknown to him, come up one after the other to Agnes; and almost always with an empressement of manner which struck him forcibly. When the music struck up, she was led to the dance; and in passing to it, he saw her again greeted eagerly by fashionables of both sexes; and wherever she moved, met by smUes of pleased recognition, and a manner of unmistakeable respect. He could not but feel surprised ; and eager, at the same time, to occupy in his turn some share of her attention : but \u2014 faithful to the understanding between them \u2014 he never approached her suffi-"], [171, "161 AGNES VALMAR. ciently near to exchange words with her, or to hear anything that passed be tween her and her numerous acquaint ances. At last, the waltz for which he was engaged to her came round.

The plainest and the humblest-minded girl never thought more humbly of her own attractions, than Agnes had done of hers, when she possessed them. But, now, she remembered !

CHAPTER XII. As Agnes graduaUy coUected her bewU dered thoughts after this trying coUoquy, a new phase of her heart's story seemed to have opened before her. There was a stUlness, a calm, around her and within her, like that one feels on plunging sud denly into dead, stirless sUence, after the din and roar and whirl and clash of deaf ening miUs or cataracts, or raging, stormy seas. Her frame felt powerless ; but her spirit was soothed, her heart light."], [235, "225 AGNES VALMAR. She had spoken \u2014 the fearful ordeal Avas gone through. It' was true, her ultimate course was yet not clear before ber \u2014 true, that aU he had said, though it had shaken, bad not decided her \u2014 that the hesitation and conflict of mind which had preceded her previous settled resolve (for such she bad thought it) were now renewed, or must be before long. StiU, she was soothed; and peaceful, hopeful feelings once more found entrance into her breast. Another tone was given to her thoughts. There would be no cruel rupture betAveen them, at least. That desolation, under any event, would be spared ber : \u2014 and his affection ! \u2014 Could she doubt its sin cerity, its strength. \u2014 Come what might, it would never faU her. And then returned to her mind, recol lections of that other joy she had so long VOL. I. Q"], [236, "226 AGNES VALMAR. anticipated \u2014 the joy of being tbe means of placing Walter in tbe high position she longed to see him hold, and from which she knew it chafed his proud spirit to feel himself shut out ; \u2014 of surrounding him with aU that could give zest and charm, and worthy, noble aim to Hfe ; \u2014 of affording him opportunity for the exer cise and display of aU his latent poAvers ; \u2014 of seeing him admired, applauded, courted, by the cultivated, the gffted, the distin guished; \u2014 of basking in his glory, and of feehng that, from her, the whole had sprung. This she could do, whatever relation they stood in, in their private home. She could make him great, sbe knew : Could sbe but make him reaUy happy too \u2014 in whatever character as touched herself \u2014 there Avould be hopes and joys enough for her. And if her"], [237, "227 AGNES VALMAR. Avhole earnest soul was bent on not missing tbe Avay, might she not trust tbat sbe Avould find it \u2014 that she would be given light to judge aright ? She bad time too, she reflected. A year ! \u2014 a year passed near him \u2014 It was an eternity to the eye of love ! She would leave aU, tben, to Time \u2014 the great, unfaUing test ! Before the term agreed upon was past, it was impossible but tbat the judgment and the hearts of both would have spoken in language too imperative to admit of further doubt. At present, she would try to banish aU these harassing thoughts : Sbe would wait and trust \u2014 and let the future form itself. With these feelings, she rose comforted ; and when they met again that evening, there was a placid smUe on her lip, which Q2"], [238, "228 AGNES VALMAR. helped to smooth the traces of uneasiness that stUl lingered on Walter's features. Neither referred to what bad passed : but they took each other's hands ; and many and many a thought had time to course through the minds of both, ere they re laxed their steady, gentle grasp. Then they drew, together, round the genial hearth, and talked again of aU they bad done while they were far asunder, tUl both forgot tbeir trouble and its cause, and remembered only that they were re united \u2014 never to part again. And now, time again flew sweetly and bhssfuUy : their spirits recovered their buoyancy ; and though they seldom, if ever, adverted in direct terms to the nearer tie which might one day bind them, and that the pecuhar position in which they now stood towards each other"], [239, "229 AGNES VALMAR. induced, by mutual tacit consent, greater caution and reserve in tbe display of their affection than heretofore, \u2014 aU that was said or done seemed to argue, on Walter's side at-aU-events, full dependance upon the ultimate desired result ; and once more the language of hopefulness and joy sprung instinctively to the lips of both. Theh sky, however, did not continue quite uninterruptedly serene. Two little clouds darkened it for a brief space, in the course of the month or tAvo that succeeded the conversation just related. Why they did so, it would perhaps be hard to say ; for in neither case did Walter's first im pulse seem quite consistent with his natural and usual character. He was anything rather than suspicious, mistrust ful or jealous by disposition ; and, least of aU, bad he ever shown himseh such with"], [240, "230 AGNES VALMAR. his Agnes, whose long affection he knew so well. But inconsistencies, after aU, are part of human nature ; and incidents avUI sometimes affect the most reasonable and justest among us, in a way for which it would be difficult or impossible to account. Tbis is nearly aU Ave can say in expla nation of the manner in which the first, at least, of the incidents we allude to, did affect Walter. His pride, perhaps, had a little to say to it \u2014 but very Httle. The uneasy, over- susceptible fearfulness, con sequent \u2014 let him bridle it as be might \u2014 on a state of uncertainty and suspense, had a great-deal more. And the species of restraint we have spoken of, which the circumstances imposed on their warmer emotions when together, had doubtless its share in producing in liim the more"], [241, "231 AGNES VALMAR. anxious, less trustful state of mind to Avhich it was owing. Another circumstance contributed also : namely, Agnes' s perhaps injudicious delay in revealing to him the secret of her iden tity with Lady Valmar ; coupled Avith the frequent separations from him which the fact rendered indispensable. If she would not put in jeopardy her recently established position in society (which she could not, on Walter's account) by perpetual rejection of the civilities la vished upon her, it became unavoidable, as tbe London season advanced, that she should be continuaUy going where he, while yet unknoAvn, could not foUow : and the Httle apparent reluctance, the cheerful ness, AAith which she did this \u2014 unacquainted as he was with the case and with the necessi-"], [242, "232 AGNES VALMAR. ties thence imposed on her \u2014 impressed bim very painfully. She \u2014 happy in bis love, strong in her oavu conscious, unalterable affection, and in the knowledge that she bad it in ber power to put an end to tbese temporary separations whenever she pleased, \u2014 merely felt tbe passing privation, and made Hght of it that he might do so too. Had he exhibited plainly to ber tbe effect it had on him, she would not have suffered this state of things to last a moment : but bis pride, and his affection together, made him study to avoid betray ing what be felt. And thus \u2014 partly wU fully, partly thoughtlessly \u2014 she delayed the Httle discovery, from day to day ; prompted by an uneasy feeling \u2014 which she was conscious of, without knowing distinctly why it existed \u2014 that the dis closure would break in, in some way, on"], [243, "233 AGNES VALMAR. the peace and reliance of those quiet days. At length, however, she felt it was time for both their sakes, that he should be ushered into that world into Avhich, sooner or later, be must be launched. There was bis place of trial : there only could he learn reaUy to know himseh. Till he had been enabled fuUy and frankly to sound his oaytl heart, sbe never could promise to be his. She determined, therefore, that the little mystery shoiUd be one no longer. At tbe same time, she would not delibe rately explain it, in the first instance. She would draw around her some of the brH liant world, which she had up to this time cautiously kept aloof from her own house ; and leave the discovery to take its chance. Accordingly ; one morning, Agnes told Walter, that on tbe morrow Lady Valmar"], [244, "234 AGNES VALMAR. would be tbere ; and tbat a large circle was engaged to meet at her house, the same night. The succeeding day, a party of intimate friends of Lady Valmar's from various parts, were coming to remain for three or four weeks, altogether in the house. Walter was to join the circle on the evening of the morrow ; and, the day after, to take up his abode in Grosvenor-square, with the rest, during their stay. He should then be made acquainted Avith Lady Val mar. ' That, once done, Agnes said, his pre sentation to aU their mutual acquaint ances \u2014 as her, Agnes's, ward and adopted relative, \u2014 would foUow as a matter of course ; as AveU as the completion of vari ous plans she meditated, and which as yet he did not know of, for the furtherance of his interests.'"], [245, "AGNES VALMAR. 235 Walter thanked her, but sighed as he did so. \" Dear Agnes,\" he said, \" I dread this arrival, Avhatever advantages to me it may bring. I fear it wiU interfere Avith the freedom of our intercourse, which is in terrupted but too much already. To ex change what is left to me stUl of it, for the Avhirl of fashionable pleasure would, at present, be exquisitely painful to me. WiU this Lady Valmar be the means of dividing us further ?\" \" No, far from it : she wUl be tbe means of keeping us always together. If where I go, henceforth, you go too \u2014 wiU no that be something gained, instead of lost ?\" \" Anything \u2014 anywhere \u2014 so that it be Avith you, my guardian angel. It is only away from you that I am sad.\""], [246, "236 AGNES VALMAR. CHAPTER XIII. The expected evening came. They had not met that day. On Walter's entrance \u2014 which took place very late, (a trifling accident having de tained him unavoidably) \u2014 aU was light and stir and glitter, and the hum of sub dued voices, and the pride and glow of dress, and rank, and beauty. But he knew no one ; and the dress, and the rank, and the beauty, Avere nothing to him. His eye sought out Agnes."], [247, "237 AGNES VALMAR. She was seated in an adjoining room, Avith a circle around her, as he had seen her before, on that night which it thriUed him to recal, at Almack's. There was the same deference and respectful admiration in tbe manner of those who addressed ber ; and tbey were not the mere butterflies of society, courting influence wherever it might be found. Walter saAV several, knoAvn to bim by sight and reputation, whose rank placed them above aU court ing, even of the highest ; whose talents, whose honoured character, whose fame, Avould render tbeir attention a flattering distinction to the proudest, the wisest and the best. He drew near graduaUy ; near enough at last \u2014 though she did not see him, for her face was averted \u2014 to catch the subject of discourse. It was plain to him that it was"], [248, "238 AGNES VALMAR. not any adventitious circumstance only, which led those who were engaged in con versation Avith her to seek her society. It pleased, it interested them \u2014 that seemed eAident. He noted how their Avit and intellect drew out hers ; how the latent powers of her fine and acute mind, of her poetical, teeming imagination, were called forth by that congenial contact ; and thought she shone, in that encouraging, inspiring atmosphere, in her true light \u2014 as much above the herd in intelligence, depth and genius, as she had ever done, in the eyes of those who were admitted into her inner life, in feehng and in truth \u2014 in every loveable quality and womanly excellence. \" And she is mine !\" said he to himseh, with a swelling heart \u2014 \"Mine! \u2014 mine alone !\" \u2014 and with the thought, his manly"], [249, "239 AGNES VALMAR. form grew taUer, nobler, and there was an exulting pride and dignity in his posture and his eye, that might have reminded any Avho had observed him of the breath ing models of Grecian art. In a minute or two, however, the recol lection recurred, that aU was stUl unde cided between them ; tbat a long and weary time must yet elapse before tbe risk of losing ber Avould be at an end; that, in the meanwhile, she was evidently sought, flattered and caressed by those to Avhom he \u2014 in rank, fortune, reputation, influence \u2014 was an absolute cipher. A cold shudder crept over bim at tbese reflections ; and a restless, nervous anxiety, which when they were alone \u2014 when this foreign, glit tering, living Avorld did not rise up between them \u2014 he never felt ; took painful pos session of bis mind."], [250, "240 AGNES VALMAR. Commanding himseh, however, he drew yet closer to Avhere Agnes sate. StUl she did not see him \u2014 the animation of converse kept ber occupied. Walter Avould have AAished it less animated, less enduring. 'Hoav Avas it, sbe did not feel tbat he stood near? Why Avas she not looking for his approach ? \u2014 it Avas aheady late \u2014 very late ! How could she be so engrossed \u2014 so happy apparently \u2014 and he away ! She forgot him !' But tbe sacrUegious thought had scarcely sprung, when she turned and caught bis eye. Why did that hitherto weU-sustained, brUHant conversation, suddenly grow slack and tame ? Why did the sharers in it, aU save herseh, by degrees drop away ? We cannot undertake to explain : Ave only knoAV it was so."], [251, "AGNES VALMAR. 241 Agnes glanced at the vacant place on the sofa beside her. It was quickly filled. \" Why so late, truant ?\" she asked. \" Did you knoAV I was late !\" She smiled \u2014 she read his thought. \u2014 \" Happiness is a great inspirer,\" she said quietly. \" WeU ! you did look happy, certainly.\" \" Did ! \u2014 Ay ! and wiU again, then,\" and she made a feint to rise. \"Nay, stay;\" said he. \u2014 \"TeU me. and Lady Valmar. . . . ?\" \" True \u2014 I forgot. But I wiU not show her to you; you must find ber out.\" \" I shaU not do tbat, to-night, if you avUI stay here, and those provokingly de lightful people avUI but leave us alone.\" He had scarcely said it, when a new ar rival, whom he recognised as the weU known, literary Marquis of F , drew vol. i. R"], [252, "242 AGNES VALMAR. near ; foUowed by another, whose features Walter thought he ought to know also, though he certainly bad never seen tbe person himseh. \" Good evening, Lady Valmar,\" said the first, quite audibly, accosting Agnes. \" WiU youaUowmeto present to you Mr. ;\" (naming one of the celebrated authors of the day, whose face met Walter's eye daUy ia the print-shop windows) \u2014 \" He has for some time desired the advantage of being made knoAvn to you ; and I engaged hun to accompany me to-night, confident of your courteous reception.\" Agnes could do no less than respond to Avhat was expected of ber, and devote her self awhUe to tbe new comers. One rapid glance, however, she threw on him beside her. \" Lady Valmar !\" she heard him mutter"], [253, "243 AGNES VALMAR. to himseh, in a low, stifled tone \u2014 AvbUe the blood rushed to his temples, and the next instant left him pale as marble. In another moment or two, Agnes shghtly turned to him again, to re-assure him with a smile : \u2014 but he did not meet ber eye. \u2014 His were fixed on the ground. \u2014 She did not see him stir ; but sbe felt the sofa they sate on quiver beneath ber. She Avas uneasy \u2014 but what could she do ? The hon rules of conventionality forced her to give ber seeming notice to those who claimed it. She could not, either, draw attention on herseh and Walter by proffering remark or expla nation, then. A minute more, and Walter rose. It was May now, and warm, genial weather, though the fires stiU smouldered in the grates. There was an open French Avindow r2"], [254, "244 AGNES VALMAR. close by, giving on a balcony, which ran round two sides of the bouse, and into which aU the rooms on that floor opened. Walter disappeared through it ; and Agnes was left to her anxiety, and to the au thor's unheeded, unheard discourse. Eresh comers, however, and the consequent stir and displacement, enabled her soon to escape ; and moving into a smaU adjoining study \u2014 occupied only at the time by the sitters at a couple of whist-tables, intent on theh game, \u2014 she slipped, unobserved, into the balcony, and sought the man she loved. He was not far. \u2014 He had turned the angle to avoid tbe noise and lights of the square ; and they both stood now in a small, dark street, where no eye would notice their presence. \u2014 She stole towards him. \u2014 He was leaning on the raU, bis head buried in his hands ; and as she"], [255, "245 AGNES VALMAR. neared, she heard he was sobbing \u2014 low, but violently. \"Walter,\" she said softly, laying her hand on his arm, \" what is distressing you?\" He raised himseh suddenly, and dashed the tears from bis eyes ; but did not speak. \" Dear Walter, why are you afflicted thus ? \u2014 and when I was rejoicing in the delighted surprise I looked forward to ! What hurts you ?\" The strange name which she had heard him repeat on the sofa, again came mourn fully to his lips. \" ' Lady Valmar!' ' Lady Valmar!' \u2014 No longer my Agnes ; \u2014 no longer my old, famUiar friend ; \u2014 my oaati, simple, un known love.\" \" Walter, this is folly. In what am I changed, except in a name, \u2014 and in the"], [256, "246 AGNES VALMAR. power of doing aU I have so pined to do, for tbe adopted chUd of my dreams ? Is your old Gardy's heart altered, because she goes by another title to the Avorld ? \u2014 because Eate has given her wealth and influence, through which to croAvn aU your wishes, aU your ambitious aspirings ? Is she not Gardy Agnes to you stUl ?\" There was no guile \u2014 no arriere-pensee in her words. StiU, as it chanced, they Avere iU-suited to Walter's existing frame of mind. They placed ber and himseh be fore bis imagination too strongly, in tbat less tender relation with which he could no longer rest content. The sudden sus picion sprung within hira that she, too, meant it thus perhaps ; that she Avished, thus, gently to prepare him anew for that rehnquishment of other hopes, with which her former conversation had threatened"], [257, "247 AGNES VALMAR. him. ' Perhaps' \u2014 he thought \u2014 ' perhaps, unconsciously to herseh, tbe station she now held, the boundless riches she possessed, the homage she received, did dazzle ber ; and create in her other views, inconsistent with exclusive, paramount love to him. She had named ambition \u2014 perhaps it had sprung in her. He had seen her admired, courted by the greatest \u2014 To what might she not aspire, if she would ? Could he beheve she alone would be insensible to all this ? Could he believe \u2014 when (cir cumstanced as she now was, and herself individuaUy being what he knew and idolised) there was scarcely any rank or power or talent she might not see at her feet, \u2014 could he beheve she would give them aU up for hi/m ? \u2014 that sbe would be satisfied with his humble, bootless love ?' Tbese were tbe thoughts that had rushed"], [258, "248 AGNES VALMAR. to his mind, when the discovery first feU on him Hke a thunderbolt; and which, now, the expressions she employed only served to confirm. \"'Gardy Agnes!'\" he rephed to her, taking up her words, \" ' Gardy Agnes !' \u2014 Yes, stiU that, perhaps \u2014 stiU that. But the love of my hopes, of my dreams, I fear, no more. \u2014 I see it aU : I see it aU. No wonder you hesitate to link your brU- Hant destinies to those of the nameless and unknoAvn ! Heavens!\" he con tinued vehemently, striking his fist against the rah, \" that I had been more fairly dealt with by fortune ! Do I not feel that I have that in me, which need bend or quaU to none ? . . . .

It was true she had latterly felt an un acknowledged dread that possibly he might take the disclosure, in some way, thus. She knew weU his high and haughty spirit : She knew it would have pleased him to have exalted his Avife \u2014 to have showered every gift of fortune upon her. She feared it might gaU him \u2014 in such a relation \u2014 to owe. But with her \u2014 Avith her \u2014 to have such a feehng ! it was hard. This was nothing, however : \u2014 But tbat he should mistrust her affection ! \u2014 that he should beheve ber so worldly-minded! \u2014 that he sbould doubt her loyalty \u2014 her truth ! \"Walter,\" she replied sloAvly, \"What have I done, that you sbould accuse me thus in your heart ? \u2014 Has my unchang ing, single-minded affection, deserved from"], [260, "250 AGNES VALMAR. you such a cruel misinterpretation as this ?\" \" Agnes !\" he exclaimed, turning to her after a moment or two \u2014 now thoroughly awakened to a sense of bis injustice, bis ingratitude: but she was gone. She had slid, noiselessly, from his side, as she stopped speaking ; and he was once more alone. He stayed only long enough to clear his brow and fit himself for encountering the careless, indifferent eyes within, and again his own sought the only being in aU tbat glittering throng who possessed interest for him. Again he found her : \u2014 but not, as before, smiUng and bright, the centre of a knot of animated, approving listeners.

Her profile only was turned towards bim, but be thought her eyes seemed closed. He made his way towards her as quickly as circumstances permitted, and was just entering the now almost empty room where she was, when a solitary passer-by \u2014 a gentleman \u2014 turning suddenly to her, in an alarmed voice exclaimed, \" Good Hea vens, Lady Valmar, are you Ul ? Is the heat too much for you ? You are so dreadfully pale.\" \" It is oppressive,\" she said, speaking Avith eAident difficulty. \" Come to the air,\" cried the person addressing her ; \" take my arm ; come to the balcony.\" \" Ob ! not there /\" sbe said quickly, \u2014 \" the conservatory is cool ; I wiU go there with you.\""], [262, "252 AGNES VALMAR. But when sbe rose, sbe found sbe had miscalculated her strength. The effort destroying the Httle she had left, she sunk doAvn \u2014 now reaUy on the point of fainting.

Ob ! bow bitterly his heart smote him ! \u2014 ' And he could not press her to it, and recover her with his warm kisses ! With those listening ears so near \u2014 he could not even speak to her, and teU her tbe remorse he felt !' \u2014 To stand thus unconcerned, however, was more than nature was equal to. ' Surely, he might approach to assist her, like an other !' She had not reached the ground, when his arm was around her, and he and the other who had before been supporting her"], [263, "AGNES VALMAR. 253 together lifted her from the room, and laid her on a bench in tbe conservatory close by. \" We bad better caU some of her female friends, from Avithin, I think,\" said the latter. \" Do,\" answered Walter, \" I aaoII stay Avith ber, whUe you do so.\" Eor a few seconds they were left alone. \u2014 He chafed her hands ; he kissed her cheeks, her forehead, ber lips : \" Agnes \u2014 my oavu Agnes,\" he whispered, \" Forgive me, forgive me : \" Come to your self \u2014 Agnes !\" The weU-knoAvn voice \u2014 the warm touch \u2014 partly roused her. He heard steps, and sprung to his feet ; but ere he left, to give place to those who entered, he saw the heavy eyelids raised \u2014 and he felt she had recognised him. Before long she returned, Avith the"], [264, "254 AGNES VALMAR. others, to her guests, \u2014 stiU pale and weary-looking, but recovered. The cir cumstance of her indisposition, however, bad been circulated through the rooms; and the party broke up, as if by common consent, much earlier than Avas customary \u2014 Walter following the last retiring cluster. Agnes, exhausted by the effort of sus taining her spirits during the close of the evening, laid herseh doAvn on the sofa in the inner music-room as soon as she was alone, to muse. She listened to the last carriage driving away, and was closing her eyes, when she heard a door open and shut again, and a soft but springing step approach. No need to teU her whose !

During the foUoAving afternoon, as Walter had reminded Agnes, the expected guests successively arrived. Agnes had Avished and arranged that it should be so as soon as her true name was revealed to him, for many reasons ; one of which was to give ber better opportuni ties of making him knoAvn, by enabling her to invite him, during tbe period of tbeir stay, to remain like them in her house. By this means, her introduction of him to aU"], [272, "262 AGNES VALMAR. who visited her during the time, would be greatly facilitated. It was true, as she had herseh explained to Walter, that as her ward and adopted relation and pre sumptive heir, there would have been no unfitness or difficulty in the way of theh* residing together, even though others were not remaining in the house also. If once it were definitively settled, that in that re lation only they were henceforward to stand, the arrangement would have been natural and unobjectionable : but as long as there was uncertainty on this point \u2014 as long as the idea of other ties was not finaUy abandoned \u2014 it was fitter, both on the world's account and their ovrn, that they should reside apart, except on tempo rary occasions like the present : \u2014 and this Walter fuUy understood. Erom among the numberless acquaint-"], [273, "AGNES VALMAR. 263 ances that Agnes had formed during the past year \u2014 from such of them, at least, as were attainable as Aisitors for a term, in a London bouse \u2014 sbe bad chosen for this projected association, those that had pleased her the best Avithout reference to any consideration but tbeir own in trinsic value. It happened, however, that in the instance of several, rank and for tune were not wanting either; and, Anth some, political power was superadded. The leading party, in all these respects intrinsic and adventitious, was that of the Marquis of Ashborougb and his family. Lord Ashborough was a man of a Httle turned sixty years of age, with a sterling heart and a perfect temper ; guUe less too, and unsuspicious as when be was a boy ; Avhose greatest happiness was that of seeing happy faces ; and whom no one"], [274, "264 AGNES VALMAR. could know intimately without loving. Though not, himseh, a member of the existing government, he had great poh tical influence ; partly from the extent of his worldly possessions, and partly from the circumstance of his being closely con nected, either by blood or by long-esta blished friendship, Avith many of tbe first ministers of the croAvn at the present date. His talents also were considerable ; bis reading and knowledge, on an infinity of subjects, quite beyond tbe common ; and, though tbe simplest of the simple in his manner and style of conversation, the latter was always instructive and inte resting, as weU as pleasing to a high degree. He had lost his Avife many years before ; but had two sweet daughters, Lady Mary and Lady Jane, Avho doted on"], [275, "AGNES VALMAR. 265 him, and who inherited most of his ami able quahties and some of his talent. Lady Mary was a bright, radiant girl of two or three-and-twenty, with a great deal of quickness, never-flagging spirits, and a smUe that would \u2014 as tbey say in the sister-country \u2014 coax tbe birds from the bushes. Lady Jane, more thoughtful and gentle but the very soul of kindness, seemed to bring an atmosphere of peace and goodness along Anth. ber wherever she moved. Both were accomplished girls \u2014 admirable musicians \u2014 and possessing cultivated minds that made them capa ble of joining, Avith pleasure to themselves and to the sharers, in almost any conver sation of interest. One other member only of tbe fanuly accompanied these (for the heir \u2014 the Earl"], [276, "266 AGNES VALMAR. of Ehnore, who was married, was not of tbe party) \u2014 Lord Ashborough's second son, Lord Charles Tremorne; a man of about Agnes' s age or a year or two older, of very noble personal appearance. As his character wiU develop itself in tbe course of our story, it is unnecessary to say much respecting it here. It avUI suffice to state tbat during a year's ac quaintance, (for Lord Ashborough's famUy had been one of the very first Lady Val mar had become known to on ber first appearing in the great world) and during between two and three months' constant association in the preceding autumn \u2014 in the course of which fuU opportunity had been afforded Agnes of judging of Lord Charles's mental and moral quahties \u2014 she had never once found him wanting. More than hah this latter period had"], [277, "AGNES VALMAR. 267 been spent at Carnbury, tbe country-seat of tbe Marquis, who, charmed with Lady Valmar, bad invited her to pay him a long visit on her leaving town at the close of the preceding season. The Marquis passed nearly aU his time in the country. Indeed bis dislike and that of his family to a London Hfe, was so great, that when he lost his whe \u2014 who had died there, and whose death had, in addition, associated it in his mind Anth painful thoughts \u2014 he had given up his bouse in toAvn ; and neither he nor his daughters ever came to London, except for a month or six weeks at a time, when they were in the habit of going to an hotel. To this circumstance it was owing, that Agnes was able to procure their so ciety now, as inmates of her house. She bad spent six delightful weeks with them ; and, when these were expired, had"], [278, "268 AGNES VALMAR. stiU retained Lord Charles's society, at in tervals, for a considerable time longer ; he baAing been a guest at many of the other country-houses to which she bad been en gaged in turn on quitting Carnbury. Tbe consequence had been a degree of friendly intimacy between her and Lord Charles, such as would have been quite unattain able amid the broken and generaUy heart less intercourse of London fashionable life. Theh minds, tempers, tastes were singu larly compatible ; and each had therefore found in the other tbe most agreeable society either met, wherever they chanced to be. Naturally, they were much to gether. There was a beautiful integrity about Lord Charles, displayed unconsciously in his every act and word, as weU as a total absence of selfishness, which won greatly"], [279, "AGNES VALMAR. 269 on Agnes's esteem and regard, and seemed to invite unhesitating trust from every mind upright and honest as bis OAvn. Though his manner was always calm, the expression of his fine face generahy seri ous and thoughtful, and his emotions in variably under strict control, Agnes saw enough of him in his relations Avith his famUy who adored him, and penetrated sufficiently deeply, in the course of their frequent conversations, into his more secret seh, to know that beneath this external repose lay feelings of the warmest, truest character, and aU the gentle affections which bless domestic Hfe. Guarded by her unwavering, aU-en grossing attachment to Walter, from the most distant approach of any tenderer sentiment, Agnes, came to look upon Lord Charles quite in a dis-"], [280, "270 AGNES VALMAR. ferent Hght from that in which she re garded aU other men ; to respect him and prize him as she respected and prized no one else \u2014 save the one. Lord Charles, meanwhUe, \u2014 appreciating Agnes equaUy highly, enjoying her society far more, and not defended, as she was, by the impenetrable armour of another love \u2014 found her, day by day, groAving more into his heart ; and ere the months we have spoken of were over, felt that sbe filled it quite, and that, henceforward, sbe, and she only, could ever be his happi ness. Undemonstrative, however, and self controUed, he kept his groAving passion concealed Avithin his OAvn breast. He had fed on it and fostered it in secret ; but no word, no outward sign, had ever given Agnes to suspect that be felt otherwise than as a sterling and congenial friend;"], [281, "271 AGNES VALMAR. or that he had for a moment entertained a thought of ber in any other Hght. His backwardness in displaying more, arose partly from the truth and depth of his feeling. He was not one who could sbht bis affections. He knew tbat when he gave them, it would be for Hfe : and when be had given them, be shrunk from taking the decisive step which \u2014 if unre sponded to \u2014 would not only destroy his present enjoyment, but shut out the species of happiness for which his nature most calculated bim from bis hopes for ever. Another cause was his recoUection of Lady Valmar' s immense wealth. He was a younger son. The Marquis was Avealthy also, it is true; but the greater part of his possessions, being, as usual, settled on the heir, Lord Charles's fortune, present and in expectation \u2014 though quite"], [282, "272 AGNES VALMAR. equal to his OAvn Avishes \u2014 was penury as compared Avith Lady Vahnar's. He shud- dered at the thought of her suspecting him of mercenary views ; and \u2014 never hasty in any of his actions \u2014 was willing, anxious, that time should ripen the sentiments of esteem and regard which he saw with joy she entertained for him, and give her reason also to feel \u2014 when he did confess his attachment \u2014 that it was not a thing of yesterday, and would not pass away. Thus, they had separated: And Avhen Agnes invited the party to spend a month with her, she had no more expectation of finding a lover in Lord Charles, than in the dear old Marquis whom she liked almost as weU. Of Lady Vahnar's other guests, Httle requires to be said. There were Sir Richard and Lady Anson,"], [283, "273 AGNES VALMAR. with a pretty daughter ; aU intelligent, good-humoured, and excellent company.

There was Mr. Sedley \u2014 a poet \u2014 gentle, retiring, but fuU of sweet, elegant, touch ing fancies, which invested every object about which he spoke with a new and, tiU then, unsuspected charm. There was Sir John Clinton, a traveUer, who had seen almost aU things wonderful in aU quarters of the globe, and had knoAvn how to look at them \u2014 which is rarer, \u2014 to draw from them their true points of interest and get at the pith and marrow of aU he heard VOL.

There was an exceedingly pleasing Scotchwoman, \u2014 a Mrs. Monteith, a Avidow, , \u2014 who had Hved with ah the bright in teUects of twenty and thirty years since, in her youth, and profited largely by the contact. Though past the meridian of life, her sprightly conversation, her accu rate, weU-expressed thoughts, and her exhaustless fund of anecdote concerning those she had knoAvn, made it always a pleasure to Hsten to her ; whUe her kindly, unaffected manners gave a sense of comfort and ease, like a breath of home, to aU who approached her, quite refreshing.

And one or two foreigners of the best class, perfect gentlemen, and in strumental performers of first-rate talents ; who \u2014 with the three Tremornes, (Lord Charles sang exquisitely) Walter, whose capacities in this respect we know, and Agnes herseh \u2014 constituted an amateur musical coterie such as is very seldom indeed to be met Avith under one roof.

It did so pass, \u2014 to the guests through out \u2014 and to Agnes and Walter, for a con siderable portion of it; and until the second Httle cloud we hinted at appeared on their horizon. It is too early, however, to think of that. It is yet distant."], [287, "277 AGNES VALMAR.

He would rather have possessed her as she was, he thought at first ; but when he saAV her, sitting, talking, smiling there \u2014 so simple, so gentle, so unchanged even in a look \u2014 he blamed himseh for the passing feehng. She was his own \u2014 Httle Agnes still, without a speck or stain ; and as he recollected how entirely she was so, not withstanding aU the changes in her out ward existence, and caUed to mind aU that had passed last night, his chest expanded with gratitude and love and"], [289, "279 AGNES VALMAR. happiness, and aU his heart was in his eyes. Something delayed dinner a Httle ; and a quarter of an hour passed thus. The day was colder, and tbe fire getting low. Agnes rose to stir it. \" Let me do tbat for you,\" a low voice murmured at her ear ; and Walter's hand was on hers as sbe held the implement. It rested tbere awhUe. \" Have you forgiven me ?\" he whis pered. \" Say something to me, Agnes ; are we friends ?\" She did not reply verbally, but raised her eyes to his for a moment \u2014 one short moment \u2014 with a look of such deep ten derness, it was worth more than anything her Hps could utter.

Then came the Httle bustle of marshal ling to the banquet-board. Walter was humblest in rank, or youngest in age, of aU the men there; and went out last \u2014 immediately before Agnes, who had taken the Marquis's arm. The table was a cir cular one, and as each pair ghded round in turn, Walter remained near Agnes, and when she took her seat, seized the watched for place on her other side. \"And noAV I am happier than aU the kings of the earth,\" he said to her softly, pretending to stoop for a faUen napkin, \u2014"], [291, "281 AGNES VALMAR. \" Let me see who shaU put me out of this seat, as long as these guests of yours stay : Miss Anson, I am crushing you, I beg your pardon,\" be added, turning gaUy to tbe merry girl be bad handed doAvn stairs ; and, on this gratuitous assumption, shifted his chair some six inches nearer to the one who bad bis heart, while aU his eyes seemed intent on penetrating the mys teries of a Vol-au-vent before him. The conversation was started in a hvely tone by Lord Ashborough. Miss An son's attention being caUed off by her other neighbour, Walter insensibly joined in it ; and, AvUd Avith spirits, threw in such strange and original ideas, \u2014 gave such quaint and irresistibly comic, sudden turns to the trialogue \u2014 and occasionahy held forth so like one inspired, now with the spirit of eloquence, and now with the spirit"], [292, "282 AGNES VALMAR. of whim, \u2014 that both bis listeners were car ried away with the stream ; and repartee and laugh foUowed each other, in rapid and unbroken succession. \" Come, eat\" \u2014 Agnes said at last, \" you .are not dining : I think the Champagne has mounted to your brain to-day.\" \" I have touched no Avine,\" he rejoined \u2014 \"shaU touch none to-day,\" \u2014 and Lord Ashborougb being appealed to just then on some knotty point by a male friend two or three seats removed \u2014 Walter went on, in a tone only heard by Agnes, \" It is another Avine I have drunk ; and that Jias intoxicated me, I acknowledge. I am not on duU earth ; I am in tbe land of dreams.\" \" The land of dreams !\" Agnes repeated, pensively : \" May be, it is so reaUy : \u2014 Yet let us stiU dream on !\" \" What do you mean ?\" exclaimed Wal-"], [293, "AGNES VALMAR. 283 ter, with a sudden change of tone ; \" Why do you say that ? \u2014 and in that manner ?\" She did not at once answer. \"Agnes,\" be added earnestly, though stUl in a voice subdued enough to escape notice, in the clatter of removing courses, \u2014 \" how can you plunge me in a moment, from tbe height of dehght into anxiety and distress like this ? Why do you do it?\" She stooped; and, under cover of her shifting posture, stole gently and timidly her hand to his, which hung doAvn by his side. \" I did not mean to give you pain, Walter,\" she said, softly. The touch of the little, light band sent a thrUl through his frame. This second sudden revulsion of feeling, overcame him for a moment ; and leaning his elbow on"], [294, "284 AGNES VALMAR. the table, he sat awhUe sUent, supporting his head with his other hand. Agnes drew away hers, and turned to Lord Ashborough, who having closed his discussion, showed the wish to renew his talk with her. \" What has happened to your ward ?\" he asked, \" His spirits seem to have faUen aU at once as they rose \u2014 Hke a West In dian hurricane.\" \" I suppose,\" answered Agnes, \"his spirit is like that of the Avinds and the storms, and subject to the same alternations.\" \" No,\" said Walter, feeling obhged to say something, \" I had a sudden pang through my heart ; I am subject to tbis, since I went to AustraHa \u2014 but tbe worst of tbe pain is over now.\" \" Oh ! but those things are very dan-"], [295, "AGNES VALMAR. 285 gerous !\" rejoined kind, unsuspecting Lord Ashborough. \" I feel they are,\" said Walter, \" And they ought to be taken in time,\" continued tbe Marquis ; \" There is nothing hke curing these things in time. I know it by myself.\" \" I perfectly agree Avith you !\" returned Walter, \u2014 a hah-smUe at last brightening his features again. \"Lady Valmar,\" resumed Lord Ash borough, \"you should make Mr. Maldon consult Dr. Thomson. Tbere is no phy sician in London to equal Dr. Thomson for these heart complaints.\" \" Is there not?\" said Agnes ; \" Walter, do you hear Lord Ashborough?

CHAPTER XVI. The evening after the repast just con cluded, passed pleasantly ; as evenings with pleasant people, amid pleasant chat, and pleasant music, generaUy do: and when Walter laid his head on his piUow that night \u2014 for the first time, for so many years, under the same roof with her he hoped ere long to caU his wife \u2014 he thought, that since his eyes had opened on this smiling world (for it was a very smiling"], [299, "289 AGNES VALMAR. one to him, then,) be bad never felt so happy. And so thought Agnes. Tbis new Ihe once joyfuUy entered upon \u2014 joyfully it Avore on. What a number of delightful, interesting conversations, took place under tbat roof, during those weU fiUed weeks ! What a number of sweet, soul-felt musical mornings were dreamed through ! What a host of suggestive, A'aluable, elevating thoughts were inter changed ! How admirably the various poAvers and talents and bright quahties of every kind, of the different members of that weU-assorted circle, were caUed forth and heightened by the encouraging, in spiring influences around !

Beyond the home circle, his success was not less. His pseudo-relationship to Lady Valmar becoming quickly bruited about in tbe world, ere long, cards and invitations were showered upon him ; and before the month was passed, his name was already placed on the visiting lists of bah Lady Valmar's acquaintance. Lord Ashborough and Lord Charles particularly, appeared attracted towards him ; and many were the expressions of Avarm and flattering approbation, and \u2014 as they came to know each other better still \u2014 of esteem and personal regard, from both, which met Agnes's delighted ear. I believe she was happier at those moments than at any others during tbe entire period. In the whole catalogue of happy sensations TJ2"], [302, "292 AGNES VALMAR. of which- our nature is susceptible, perhaps there is none more unmixed, more tho roughly delightful, than that we expe rience on hearing the praise of one we love. On aU these occasions, however, Agnes outwardly received these gratifying re marks, only as might be expected from one in her knoAvn position AAith respect to tbe ward she had brought up : and not the faintest ghmmer of suspicion ever arose, in a single individual's mind, tbat there was more in her love for bim than met the eye.

He found it a very unsophis ticated story indeed ; but there was some thing in it tbat attracted him. As he went on, the thoughts \u2014 and, more than the thoughts, something in the incidents too \u2014 reminded him of Agnes. Strongly interested now, he continued to read on : when, suddenly, at the expression of some feehng in which he seemed to recognise her more distinctly, the notion flashed upon him that this book was hers \u2014 could have been written by no one but ber.

She had never named it to him ; but \u2014 if indeed"], [304, "294 AGNES VALMAR. the Avriter had pourtrayed, consciously or unconsciously, emotions that had been experienced, \u2014 there was so much tender ness, so much faithfulness, so much gentle, dehcate, devoted feehng, in the pictures drawn ; that he felt, should Agnes indeed prove to be tbe Avriter, be bad never reaUy knoAvn ber untU now. Excited to an almost painful degree \u2014 his heart bursting with love for her whose mind, whose soul, he seemed to be entering into at eA'ery line \u2014 he retired immediately to his room A\\ith tbe book; reading on now with an eagerness, tbat left him scarce breathing time tiU he had concluded it. He had then scarcely any doubt remaining; though most of the events of the story were by no means in accordance with the facts of her Hfe or his \u2014 nor could be. But no two minds or hearts \u2014 he thought \u2014"], [305, "295 AGNES VALMAR. could be so Hke, as Agnes's and the writer's of that book. The date of the publication, too, he found on examination, corresponded Avith the period when be was absent in Aus tralia ; after tbey bad parted, and before tbe wheel of fortune bad drawn her from her former, humbler sphere. \" Dear, fond, faithful creature,\" he said to himseh, \"how far I was from feehng aU you were worth; from knoAving what mines of goodness and tenderness were in that heart, which \u2014 much as I prized it \u2014 I undervalued nevertheless.\" He was roused from his reverie, by the entrance of a servant Avith articles of his toUette ; and had barely time to change his dress and descend, when dinner was announced. In the course of tbe evening, Walter"], [306, "296 AGNES VALMAR. quietly placed the book on a smaU table, near which Agnes frequently sate; and, watching his opportunity when sbe had gone to occupy this place, and when there was no one in its immediate vicinity, he drew near her. \" Do you know what I have been doing all day ?\" he asked. \"How should I?\" \" I have been reading this s and be laid his hand on the volumes, opening the title page of one.

The corner was dark, and he was so concealed by the curtains"], [351, "AGNES VALMAR. 19 Lord Charles had not perceived him there ; nor had Agnes, who having been occupied answering a note when be sought tbe re tirement, imagined Walter had quitted the room. A sudden stir in the curtain drew the eyes of both, as tbey were returning, to the spot. Both saw Walter, and felt that his eye had been upon them. At the same moment, Lord Ashborough, Avho bad noticed Walter in tbe Avindow, caUed out to him to come over near him, now that their hostess was there; for he wanted to appeal to her to decide some thing they had been arguing doAvn-stairs, after tbe ladies bad left.

The consciousness brought a quick crimson blush to Agnes's cheek ; and tbis, combining with the pained conviction she bad of Walter's distress, which nevertheless she bad no possible means, then and tbere, of aUay ing, her seh-possession almost entirely deserted her, and sbe dropped into a seat, perceptibly flurried and abstracted. Lord Charles withdrew to a distance,"], [354, "22 AGNES VALMAR. and took up a book. Tbe Marquis, not giving what was acting before him a second thought, continued his explanations. But neither the glance, nor the blush, nor the agitation, had escaped Walter ! and, groAring paler even than before, he closed his band on tbe back of a chair on which he Avas leaning, and Lord Charles saAv it aU but snap Avitbin bis tightening grasp. The others who sate near now joining in, the conversation became general : and amid tbe varied talk of tbe lighter-hearted, the sUence of those three, whose thoughts were not with tbe discourse sustaining around them, remained unnoticed.

Lord Charles appealed to her Arith bis eye ; she looked at him deprecatingly, but sbe said nothing. After vainly endeavouring to escape, be said, at last, ' he would sing \u2014 but not that song.'

His voice ceased suddenly ; and he bent his bead over the keys, as he con tinued the unfinished air on tbe instru ment on which he had been accompanying himseh. Agnes would have given the world to have been able to remain unmoved. She tried not to hear the notes, not to bear the words ; to turn her mind entirely from the"], [360, "28 AGNES VALMAR. persons and things about ber ; to think of anything and everything else that was most commonplace and indifferent : \u2014 but it would not do ! the sounds penetrated to her ear, and to her heart, in her OAvn de spite. When she detected the rising tremor in Lord Charles's voice \u2014 knowing so weU aU he was feehng \u2014 the tears sprung to her eyes, whether she would or no ; and when he broke abruptly off, sbe could not help theh escaping from the fuU Hds.

And this was not lost on Walter ! \" Come; we wiU have no more music to-night,\" said kind Lord Ashborough ; \" it makes us ah low-spirited.

The former came first \u2014 seating himseh, Arith a general bow of greeting, but with out a word, in his accustomed place next Lady Mary. \" I trust your headache is better this morning,\" she said, turning to him gaUy ; \" but no, indeed, I fear it is not.

He came down in a few minutes after the summons, apologising for bis delay, and saying ' he had forgotten the time \u2014 he had not heard the breakfast beU,' &c. He spoke cheerfully, and seemed desirous \u2014 Agnes saw \u2014 by apparent gaiety of manner and Hveliness of conversation, to turn attention from the too palpable evidence bis oaati features bore of sleep lessness, and struggle, and many tears. He succeeded, so far as the unsuspect ing Avere concerned ; but the sunken eye"], [367, "35 AGNES VALMAR. and swoUen Hds, tbe stained and bhstered skin, were noted alike by Agnes and by Walter. Had the latter reflected dispassionately, be might have found in those very signs proofs of tbe groundlessness of bis appre hensions ; \u2014 but he was not dispassionate, and therefore did not reflect dispassionately; and it seemed to him that the pain of part ing, and uncertainty, might have done all this, even though Lord Charles's future connexion Avith Agnes was by no means be lieved by bim to be hopeless. Gloom settled again upon Walter's brow ; and, this time, Agnes \u2014 knoAving it was causeless, and that an hour or two hence sbe could dispel it vritb a word ; hurt too at his injustice ; an noyed Avith bim for the unfriendly feelings sbe saw he was fostering towards Lord Charles ; and sincerely touched and pained d 2"], [368, "36 AGNES VALMAR. at the latter's evident deep distress ; \u2014 Agnes made no further present effort to clear it away. Tbe party adjourned to the draAving rooms ; the carriages arrived, and were packed; the ladies went up-stairs, and came down again bonneted and cloaked; and there was nothing, now, before them, but tbe leave-takings. Lord Ashborough, shaking both Lady Vahnar's hands cordiaUy, urged ber to re deem a promise sbe had made him some time since, of going to spend a month or two at Carnbury; and pressed ber to agree to come directly the London season was over. \" I cannot,\" she said, \" indeed I cannot \u2014 not now \u2014 not so soon.\" \"WeU, later then; when you avUI.

CHAPTER V. When Agnes awoke from tbat long, heavy, dreamless sleep, the sun was stUl high in the heavens. She needed not to rise yet for some hours. She lay, and mused long and profoundly. Walter had been on tbe point of binding himseh by a solemn oath to her ; and yet bis worldly position \u2014 aU which might operate a change in bis sentiments \u2014 was still almost unaltered. The captivating circles of fashionable and high-born so-"], [390, "58 AGNES VALMAR. ciety, Avith aU theh female loveliness and manifold fascinations, were but just open ing to him. Tbe exciting paths of pohtical or literary ambition, Avith theh deeper and more engrossing enthusiasms, were stiU quite untrod, unentered on. As yet no opportunity bad been afforded by which either she, or he, could test his real re quirements for happiness, in tbe new career which lay before him. Agnes, we know, bad one fixed object in Aiew ; at which she would steadUy aim, though, to reach it, ber course were over the grave of her OAvn joy. She would not endanger tbat object by suffering Walter to act in tbe dark. Accordingly her first act after the scene last narrated, and performed tbe suc ceeding day (aU necessary preliminaries having been gone through long before),"], [391, "59 AGNES VALMAR. was to render Walter independent, not of tbe world only, but of ber; by making over to bim a princely fortune, and a mag nificent country-place and estate which she had bought for the advantage of sea air and varied scenery, in a romantic spot near the coast. Walter would have resisted, had he knoAvn her intentions ; but ah was finaUy executed and signed before be received a hint of them. \" You accept this from your old Gardy, Walter,\" she said to him, when he sup plicated ber to suffer bim to owe nothing to ber, tUl sbe gave him that without which all the rest was valueless ; \" I would not wish, shoiUd tbe other gift of which you speak be yours, tbat its idea should be blended with tbat of any worldly things.

A seat in ParHament, to which Lord Ashborough's influence enabled him to return the member, bad just become vacant. Agnes apphed to tbe Marquis for it, for her ward. Ere a fortnight had elapsed since the party at her house had separated, Walter filled this vacant seat ; and was already devoting aU the time he did not spend near Agnes, to earnest study of the subjects of moment which Avere likely shortly to come before tbe House. Tbis year happened to be one, when interests of the most Aital importance, domestic and foreign, were on tbe balance. The position of the ministry was critical. p 2"], [400, "68 AGNES VALMAR. There was every prospect of the Session being of a hitherto unexampled length. Aheady it was rumoured ParHament would sit tiU the end of September ; pos sibly later. And tbere were surmises also, tbat, when it met again in November, it would not do so for form's sake only, but would be required reaUy to assemble for tbe despatch of business. The circumstances were propitious for Walter's object. June was not yet over. There was probably a long time before him, therefore, even preAdous to the prorogation. Stimulated by tbe aim be had in Aiew, bis reaUy splendid natural and acquired powers seemed to expand, as he studied and Avorked, to a degree that astonished himseh. Three parts of every night, and aU those evenings when, from circumstances, he would have been quite"], [401, "AGNES VALMAR. 69 or virtually separated from Agnes ; every hour also of tbe days which, from any reason, he could not pass alone, or nearly alone, Avith her; he employed in endea vouring to master tbe question relative to which be intended to make his first pubhc effort. And before many weeks had passed, with a gloAving sense of in- Avard pleasure and triumph be felt be had mastered it. \" Agnes, my OAvn Agnes, my Httle Gardy dear,\" be said to ber, one afternoon ; rushing up quickly to her, and kissing both her cheeks before she knew where she was, \u2014 \" Do you know that to-night something is going to happen ?\" \" What, dear Walter ?\u2014 Something that pleases you apparently; and, if so, of course it pleases me :\" and her face beamed Avith happy expectation."], [402, "70 AGNES VALMAR. \" I know that, my darling Httle Gardy ; and it is all to please yon. I have no other object. I am to make my first speech to-night, Agnes ; and something tehs me it avUI not be thought a bad one.\" Agnes looked grave directly \u2014 yet pleased still. \" This is, indeed, intelligence of deep interest to me, dear Walter. Have you thoroughly mastered tbe subject which is to be debated to-night ? It is a most momentous, as weU as an intricate and trying one. Do you feel confident of success ?\" \" I do, dearest : have no fear.\" \" I avUI have none, then. I know your powers of mind, Walter. I know your capability of apphcation too, when you choose.

I say, there fore, in my turn, to you, dear Walter \u2014 have no fear. Nothing but the nervous ness which forms also part of your nature, \u2014 which generaUy does, I beheve, attend, more or less, upon genius, as distinguished from mere acute, reasoning power \u2014 can make you fail, where once you have zealously and perseveringly aimed at suc cess. Steel yourseh against that alone ; and you wUl \u2014 you must \u2014 triumph over aU difficulties.\" Thus did tbe quiet, encouraging counsel of tbe woman be esteemed and regarded tbe most on earth, infuse fresh courage in Walter's mind, and arm bim against tbe only perU he reaUy had to encounter. \" Your approval and encouragement,"], [404, "72 AGNES VALMAR. dearest,\" be said as be left her, \" have given me aU I stiU lacked when I came to you. I shaU be more seh-possessed, beheve me, before tbe large and solemn assembly I am now going to meet, than I am at tbis moment, with that loved face before me and tbat dear hand in mine.\" The instant he was gone, Agnes rang for ber carriage ; and driving to the House, secured a seat in tbe cramped and suffo cating locality, to which tbe gaUantry of British senators has restricted the Avives and sisters and mothers and lady-loves, of those who are bidding for fame or for fortune in the arena below.

By degrees, signs of"], [406, "74 AGNES VALMAR. marked approval and admiration, more quickly and more earnestly repeated as he went on, interrupted and encouraged hhn. As he got through tbe more matter-of-fact and difficult part of bis task, and ap proached that devoted to elucidation and illustration \u2014 fired by bis subject, and giving loose more freely to tbe varied richness of bis brilliant imagination \u2014 he fascinated and transported, as before he had impressed and convinced. Bursts of applause now broke, minute after minute, from every part of the House ; and when be sate down, it was amid one universal cheer and storm of admiration such as bad not been heard in the House for years. Members crowded round bim, shaking him by tbe hand and congratulating bim ; and, among these, two or three of tbe"], [407, "75 AGNES VALMAR. ministers of the croAvn, Avith whose Adews he had sided on the present occasion.

She bad not been there a quarter of an hour, when Walter entered \u2014 as quietly as if he had just risen from his newspaper, \u2014 Avith a placid smile on bis face, and no trace of excitement except a stiU flushed cheek.

CHAPTER VII. The results to Walter of bis admirable speech were immense ; far greater than he bad reckoned on. The ministry were sorely in want, at that particular juncture, of some new and strik ing talent on theh side. That displayed by Walter was of incalculable value to them; might even be the means of pre serving theh tottering power. Lord Cour tenay, the head of the administration,"], [411, "AGNES VALMAR. 79 eagerly courted his support, and sought his society. In a very short time, Walter found himseh overwhelmed, on tbe one band Avith political business, and on tbe other Avith social engagements, among the chiefs of the party he had espoused and theh families. This was more than he de shed ; for the unavoidable consequence was that be spent more and more of his time apart from the woman be loved. His mornings were now, of necessity, princi paUy occupied in the research and prepara tion indispensable to enable him to speak on the various subjects under discussion. His afternoons were spent in the House ; often, of course, the long nights also ; and when they were not, he found it next to impossible to escape from the invitations which his new friends flatteringly forced upon him. These led him into circles dif-"], [412, "80 AGNES VALMAR. <. ferent from those which Agnes principally frequented. It bad been easy for ber to introduce her ward and adopted heir \u2014 a man, young, single and independent, now opulent also \u2014 wherever she visited. It was quite differ ent in bis case. He could not present her where he went and where sbe chanced not to be known. It foUowed, tbat, without seeming ungracious and morose, he cordd not avoid being frequently separated from Agnes, even during tbe evenings devoted, or said to be devoted, to pleasure. He was grievously annoyed and pained by tbis, and so was she, of course : but when he lamented it to her, and expressed bis wish, Avhatever tbe effect might be, forcibly to break through these irksome trammels; she insisted on his not doing so, considering that he would thus en-"], [413, "81 AGNES VALMAR. danger his newly-born popularity among those on whom his further advancement depended. She kneAV that he aimed at obtaining an important political appoint ment ; and tbat bis daring ambition \u2014 now tbat the first outworks had been so glori ously Avon \u2014 stopped at nothing short of becoming master, sooner or later, of the citadel itseh. She would not permit bis onward course to be checked, and perhaps turned to defeat, by any consideration con nected Avith ber. Impatient as he was under the privation, even be felt the position he was carving out for himseh as yet too insecure, to render it Arise for bim to neglect any of the courtesies of life. He felt Agnes was right ; and \u2014 dwelling in- Avardly on the gradually approaching time, when both goals, as he hoped, would be reached at once \u2014 he turned manfully to VOL. II. G"], [414, "82 AGNES VALMAR. his seh-imposed tasks ; and merged for a brief interval, as be thought, the affection ate ward and the warm lover, in the steady, laborious politician. Eor awhUe, Agnes bore tbese weary separations manfully too \u2014 if we may take licence to apply the word to a woman. Satisfied and at ease whUe he showed, when with her, that they were as Httle in accordance Avith bis Avish as Avith her own, she allowed no word of complaint or regret to escape her Hps ; no sad look to depress or discourage bim. After some time, however, she noticed that his expressions of annoyance became less frequent and less strong; his visits shorter and farther between. She thought he seemed weary and pre-occupied, too, even when they were together. She missed those terms of endearment, those ever-"], [415, "83 AGNES VALMAR. springing tender thoughts, which used to prove to her tbat her idea was always the prevailing one in bis mind and heart. StUl she felt no absolute, defined, anxiety ; nor did ber OAvn manner alter in anything. She was aware there were serious causes for pre-occupation on his part. The po htical crisis which was impending and on the issue of which the permanence of the present ministry in office was at stake, and with it all Walter's present prospect of power, was surely sufficient to account for it. Even though she bad not been aware of this, however, sbe would have suffered neither discontent nor alarm to be apparent to him. She would not interfere Anth ber OAvn work ! The experiment she had thought it needful for him to make, was being made. It sbould be worked out fairly and fuUy, Avithout let or hindrance g2"], [416, "84 AGNES VALMAR. of hers. Sbe would not be false to bim \u2014 to herself \u2014 or to the right ! If, in the battle of stirring Ihe into Avhich of his OAm choice he bad plunged, he found bis interest in her wane and suffice him no longer ; if in his intercourse Avith tbe youth and loveliness which were now constantly thrown in his path, he felt a warmer one arise in his heart Anth A\\rhich bis fidehty to her in one sense was incompatible ; \u2014 it was not for her to com plain or to resist. Had it not been her doing ? Was it not expressly for that \u2014 if such indeed should be tbe result \u2014 that she had delayed, had denied herseh, the happi ness he pressed upon her ? She feared, indeed, that his affectionate, sensitive nature would render bim but too much ahve, in that event, to the pain she"], [417, "AGNES VALMAR. 85 might feel. It was her place, her settled purpose \u2014 if things sbould really turn out so \u2014 to make his course easy for him ; to lessen bis hesitation and lighten bis com punction, by concealing from bim entirely the state of ber oavu feelings ; by subsiding gently, imperceptibly, into tbe guardian and affectionate friend once more. This, she felt she had the courage to do ; for in that smaU, fragUe female form, and in tbat gentle, tender, acutely- sensitive heart, there was yet an inward strength belong ing to beings of another mould ; a strength based, in her, on the very quahties and feehngs which would have made many other women weak in such a case \u2014 her warm affections, tbe energy, tbe depth of her love. In this way passed the time, tUl the"], [418, "86 AGNES VALMAR. Prorogation of ParHament ; which, as had been expected, did not take place tiU after the close of September. When it did, there was again a brief period of comparative brightness, rehance and peace. Tbe interval between tbe prorogation and tbe reassembling, was to be spent, by mutual agreement, at Valmar ; the former half-projected visit to Carn bury being put off indefinitely for tbe present. Not tbat any unpleasantness between Agnes and Walter would have attached to it, since the explanation be tween them, which bad set Walter's fears Avith regard to Lord Charles at rest entirely ; but that, under existing circumstances, Agnes' s OAvn mind was not so attuned as to contemplate Avith pleasure a residence anywhere except under her oven roof. Walter and Lord Charles had, indeed,"], [419, "87 AGNES VALMAR. by this time, become the best of friends ; the latter having come to toAvn again, alone, about six weeks after tbe disper sion of tbe party at Lady Valmar' s, and laid himseh out to cultivate Walter's society and regard. He bad not, however, presented himself at Lady Vahnar's, untU two or three weeks before sbe left toAm ; and whenever he went there, he went Avith Walter. They met as sbe bad wished; without any outward agitation on his part, or ap parent recalling of tbe past ; but stiU frankly and cordially, as mutually valued, cherished friends. On going to the country \u2014 as the same objections would have attached to Agnes and Walter residing at present alone to gether, there, as in toAvn \u2014 the former had arranged that a smaU knot of friends"], [420, "88 AGNES VALMAR. should assemble at Valmar. Business was partiaUy laid aside by Walter; and, at times, as they once more wandered, and talked, and read, and sang together, Agnes forgot her misgivings, and confidence and love and joy again rose high and warm in ber heart. This bHssful period was, however, brief. By intense watchfulness, unrelaxing ex ertion, and skilful man\u0153uvring, tbe mi nisterial crisis that had been anticipated had been warded off at tbe close of tbe past Session ; Only, however, for the same wrestle of parties to recommence, more hotly and fiercely than ever, when tbe House again met. That which had only been surmised some months since, was now decided : In November business was really to begin again; and to continue (except during tbe brief recesses at Christmas and"], [421, "89 AGNES VALMAR. Easter) uninterruptedly. Six or seven weeks, therefore, was aU that could be given to relaxation ; and even during tbese, a great deal of private work was to be got through, preparatory to the coming war. Even at Valmar, consequently, large portions of Walter's time \u2014 of those pre cious, precious hours, which could not be recaUed ! \u2014 bad to be spent by bim in his OAvn study, alone ; whUe Agnes listlessly fulfilled her reluctant duties of hostess, nervously watching for his approaching footstep, and wondering why the persons around her were so stupid and so duU, and how it was she had ever found them otherwise. At last \u2014 a fortnight before the meeting of ParHament \u2014 Walter entered the break fast-room, with an open letter in his hand ;"], [422, "90 AGNES VALMAR. and announced that he was unexpectedly summoned, on matters of urgency, to join Lord Courtenay at his country-seat. Agnes's cheek paled. A fortnight lost \u2014 the fortnight which would have been tbe happiest: for his needful private labours were just concluded, and the rest of the interval of repose, he had told her, he could devote entirely to her. He had la boured Avith double assiduity, and had been, therefore, hitherto more absent from her than would otherwise have been need ful, purposely tbat this Httle fortnight might be entirely free. And now he was to go \u2014 and at once ! Not an hour's delay was admissible. His carriage was ordered \u2014 would be round ere bis hasty breakfast could be taken. Not a minute for EareweU : not a mi nute for those brief words, those httle tokens of affection, which seem scarce"], [423, "91 AGNES VALMAR. anything at tbe moment, but on which tbe loving heart lives when that moment is over ; which it dweUs on, feeds on, again, and again, and again, rejecting aU other nutriment \u2014 and tireth never ! There were others in tbe breakfast-room. A warm grasp of the hand was aU that could pass between those two ! Agnes thought Walter looked as if he would fain have been Aritb her a moment alone. She made some excuse, and left the room directly after bim : but there were half-a-dozen prying eyes in the hall too \u2014 officious servants, who never, since the world began, were absent, Avhen theh presence was particularly disagreeable, \u2014 stragglers from tbe breakfast-table, or late comers to it. It was not practicable. Eor the first time in their Hves, tbey parted Avithout a word or outward mark of more than common friendship."], [424, "92 AGNES VALMAR. There was reaUy nothing in this. Tbere was no one to blame for it : they would very soon meet again, and he had seemed, sbe thought, to Avish it otherwise. StUl it pained ber, more deeply than she chose to confess to herseh ; and when she turned to go back to tbe now intrusive circle to Avhich bis presence no longer gave interest and charm, sbe felt a heavy, duU, sense of misfortune creep over her which in vain sbe struggled to cast off. He had said be hoped to be able to re turn; that be trusted a few days might be aU Lord Courtenay would require of bim. But tbe weeks passed, and be came not ; and, in Heu, she received a few hurried lines, now and then, expressive simply of his disappointment, and of the impossi bility of escape. Time \u2014 heavy or gay \u2014 however, passes"], [425, "AGNES VALMAR. 93 at last : And at length the old routine of theh former Hfe in London was renewed. Another long period of mixed toU and dis traction was entered upon. Not for six months more, would Walter's and ber future be fixed. It was an op pressive thought \u2014 but she did not falter. In the beginning \u2014 London being empty as far as the fashionable world was con cerned, except for such as had to attend ParHament, and those of theh famiHes Avho chose, Hke Agnes, in fashion's despite to accompany them \u2014 Agnes saw more of Walter than she had done during tbe close of tbe preceding season. But as toAvn gradually filled, the former state of things recurred worse than ever ; and very Httle was tbe time tbey spent together. The house Walter most constantly fre quented, was that of Lord Courtenay, with"], [426, "94 AGNES VALMAR. whom Agnes was unacquainted. It was natural, and most advisable, he should frequent it : nor was there anything, tbat Asnes knew of, to render his visits there in any way unfavourable to the interests of her oaati affection. Lord Courtenay had no daughters \u2014 was not even married ; and therefore Walter's repeated engagements at bis house gave her, at first, no un easiness on tbe score of a possible attach ment elsewhere. It is true she thought he might, oftener than he did, have found, or made, reasons for declining the more and more rapidly recurring invitations.

Here, tben, was tbe explanation of all tbat had seemed strange and altered in him : his increased absences ; his compara tive sUence and reserve when with her \u2014 for these last, too, during tbe past month, had become painfully apparent to her. A torturing struggle, she conceived, was going on in his breast.

And in doing this, to convince him, if she could, that it was not at the cost of her peace ; that no fears, no remorse on her account, need mingle Avith his cup of bliss. It was a rugged task.

Difficulties beset her on every side, when she considered \u2014 not ivhat she had to do \u2014 but how she was to do it. Here, she could not see her way.

In this state of mind we wiU leave her for a brief space, and see what had been passing meanwhile in Walter's. VOL. II. I"], [446, "114 AGNES VALMAR. Was it aU true ? And was his heart faithless to his early vow. No \u2014 never ! And yet part was true. It was true, that Lady Lucy was lovely and young, the idol of Lord Courtenay, the intended heiress of his fortune and lands. It was true, that Lord Courtenay had fixed on Walter for tbis, his darling's, mate ; had set his heart upon it entirely. Walter's was a suitable alhance for her in every respect. He possessed wealth and magnificent talents, had aheady acquired fame, and was on the road to the loftiest station. PersonaUy, Lord Courtenay de lighted in him, esteemed him, sincerely regarded him ; had yet seen no other man to whom he could, with such thorough satisfaction of mind, have given his now adopted chUd. It was true, that Walter at last per-"], [447, "AGNES VALMAR. 115 Ceived the views Lord Courtenay enter tained Arith regard to himseh and bis niece. It was true, also, (Alas ! Alas !) tbat on his making this discovery, he had not tbe firmness, at once, to cut them short. At that particular period, Lord Cour- tenay' s favour, the pubhc marks given of it, his personal intimacy with him, were of the most critical importance to his further pohtical success. They were the stepping- stones to that power and renown, which he had sworn in bis heart be would earn, to lay at his beloved Agnes' s feet. Later stiU, the high ministerial appointment \u2014 of which the loungers, whose careless words had rung the knell of our poor Agnes's joy, had spoken \u2014 feU vacant. It was of course virtuaUy in Lord Courtenay's gift, as head of the administration. At the 12"], [448, "116 AGNES VALMAR. present stage of Walter's progress, to obtain this appointment was to crown his most ambitious hopes ; was far more than he bad dared previously to aspire to, for a long time to come. He could not bring himseh to stay his brUHant, onward course; to overthrow, perhaps, the whole fabric he had buUt up at the cost of so much toU, \u2014 of so much more than toU \u2014 division from the woman for whose sake he had been buUding it ; by roughly and ungraciously thwarting the friendly, the flattering, intentions which he saw Lord Courtenay had formed in bis favour. Unfortunately, the ready mode of checking these without ungraciousness or offence, which would have been afforded by announcing his pre-engagement, was not as yet open to him. He did not, nevertheless, utter a word,"], [449, "117 AGNES VALMAR. or perform an act, which could be con strued, however indirectly, into an indica tion of similar intentions on his OAvn part. Such conduct would have been whoUy in consistent with honour. On tbe contrary, he studiously avoided even appearing cog nisant in any way of Lord Courtenay's Avisbes; and cautiously steered clear of every exclusive attention to the beautiful girl herseh, which might either Ann on her affections, or strengthen Lord Courte nay in his unparticipated projects. But Avith aU this, he did not so act, as to cause Lord Courtenay to give them up. With out in any way abetting them, he did not distinctly show they were vain. And thus Lord Courtenay, naturaUy confident in the effect of his niece's mani fold attractions, continued in the belief that the alliance he desired, would, in"], [450, "118 AGNES VALMAR. aU probabihty, be brought about, \u2014 and Walter knew that he did so. Walter also knew, that even this com paratively shght abandonment of plain dealing, was wrong. He felt it keenly; for bis was by nature, as weU as on prin ciple, an upright, honest mind. This was the first \u2014 tbe only \u2014 deviation from the straight path, he had ever in his life been guUty of; and he Arinced under it Hke \"the gaUed jade.\" StUl, he had not moral courage, at the moment, to despise and rise above the in tricacies of bis difficult situation ; to make perhaps \u2014 from a firm and zealous friend \u2014 a determined enemy, of tbe man who held at that day aU power in his hands. He had not courage to do it, on Agnes' s ac count : it was for her the goal he aimed at was so eagerly desired. He made a"], [451, "AGNES VALMAR. 119 compromise Avith bis conscience : promis ing himself, tbat the moment tbe vacant appointment was bestowed, whether on him or on another, he would no longer suffer a shadow of doubt to rest on his intentions ; he would no longer have one sore spot on his hitherto sound, unsullied mind. But why \u2014 since he was true to her, since his heart was unchanged \u2014 why did he not make Agnes, as usual, the de positary of his feelings ? Why did he not make his difficulties knoAvn to her, explain to her bis motives ; tbat so, at least, she might understand bim ? Eirst ; for tbe reasons we have but now detaUed \u2014 because he knew he was doing wrong; because he knew her unflinching integrity would not approve him ; because he could not bear to sink in her esteem, as he had done in his OAvn. Secondly ; be-"], [452, "120 AGNES VALMAR. cause, in the very nature of his derehction, tbere was something which could not but be more or less offensive to her feelings, to her pride, to her woman's delicacy. Meanwhile he became aware that the idea of his marriage with Lady Lucy had, notwithstanding aU bis caution, been named in tbe world ; at least among those who frequented Lord Courtenay's house, for Lady Lucy was as yet knoAvn only to those. He dreaded its coming to Agnes' s ears. In a very short time, his conduct sbould prove tbe groundlessness of tbe report; but, in tbe interval, he was un easy \u2014 never reaUy at peace Avith himself \u2014 and after every brief absence, he dreaded to meet her eye.

As evU Eate would have it, however, on tbat very morning, some circumstances bad passed, which had more than ordinarily disturbed Walter ; and indisposed bim to tbat frankness which might yet have saved them.

Some petulant words which bad dropped from Lord Courtenay, bad at tbe same time led him to suspect, that his Lordship, Avithout confessing so much to himself, was secretly influenced by an im pulse of wounded pride and feeling, occa sioned by tbe uncertainty he was permitted to remain in regarding Walter's views to-"], [457, "AGNES VALMAR. 125 wards bis niece. Walter thought tbe real fact might prove to be, that his being named or not named to this place, would depend on his conduct in tbat other respect. Not that Lord Courtenay was capable of suffering himseh to be consciously actuated, in a public matter, by personal motives ; but tbat the temper of his mind, and the Hght in which he viewed things and per sons, would, Avithout his being aware of it, be modified by them. Lord Courtenay, Arith numberless excel lent quahties, and first-rate abilities, was a man of impulse ; naturaUy of warm pas sions, which he had learned to control, but not wboUy to subdue ; and stUl far from exempt from prepossessions ; stiU liable occasionaUy to be blinded and misled, by partial considerations and temporary feel ing. Walter had studied his character,"], [458, "126 AGNES VALMAR. and knew him weU ; and his present sus picion was not whoUy without founda tion. It certainly was the fact, at least, that Lord Courtenay was more or less irri tated ; and did think, that, by seeming to Avithhold the nomination, and quickening Walter's anxiety for it, he might hasten his dilatory declaration. The dilemma in which Walter stood, not unnaturaUy much engrossed his thoughts: and, as he did not see his way out of it, produced an amount of uneasiness in his mind, which could not but be perceptible in his manners. There was an appearance of abstraction and discomfort about him, that night, which exceeded any Agnes had previously noticed. When she sought to lead gently to the subject then exclusively occupying her own mind ; some remark of his, whoUy uncon-"], [459, "127 AGNES VALMAR. nected with it, impressed her with the be- Hef, either that his thoughts were else where, or tbat he intentionaUy and reso lutely warded it off. Her heart faUed her \u2014 She could not speak. The deepening conviction, too,Avith which bis manner filled her, of the more than truth of aU she beheved,\u2014- spite of herseh, overpowered her spirits. It was not that there had remained any hesitation about her, previous to this meeting, as to the course it was now imperative in her to pursue: but the confirmation, in this dreary, unmodified way, of aU the Avorst she had anticipated ; this hard, rough banishment from tbe heart where \u2014 if not in a warmer Hght, at least as a che. rished, trusted friend \u2014 she once beheved she would have dwelt for ever; was a"], [460, "128 AGNES VALMAR. severer trial than even she, had calcu lated on.

Cut to the quick \u2014 recoiling on herseh like a bruised worm \u2014 aU sbe could do, at last, was to answer briefly tbe indifferent remarks be made ; and, by an extraordi nary exertion of self-command, to succeed in concealing from bis observation what"], [461, "129 AGNES VALMAR. was passing within her.

Just when ber sense of wretchedness, her growing agitation, were reaching a point which must have defied all further bridling; a sudden summons arrived for Walter from Lord Courtenay. His pre sence was requested without an instant's delay. A gleam of triumphant excitement passed across his features ; for he felt an inward presentiment that some change had come over Lord Courtenay's mind, and that his OAvn lofty aspirations were about to be immediately realised.

As he walked back to bis lodgings, scarce an hour before daAvn ; an impulse he could not resist, led bim \u2014 though he knew of course aU were buried in slumber \u2014 to make a shght detour and pass before Agnes's bouse. He stopped on reaching it ; and raising his eyes and hands towards the Avindows of the room he knew she occu- i pied, breathed aloud a blessing on her, and a thanksgiving for the Hfe of bhss which be no longer doubted awaited them both. He did not notice the faint glimmer through the close-fitting shutter, which"], [467, "135 AGNES VALMAR. would have told him tbat his Agnes watched and mourned : but, with a Hght heart, he went his way, and soon was wrapped in a tranquU sleep.

She heard the low sounds of the voice beneath. They struck her, vaguely, as not unfamiliar. Sbe rose hastily, and went to tbe window ; and, unbarring it, looked out. A figure was retiring through tbe shades of the night ; but tbe darkness was as yet"], [468, "136 AGNES VALMAR. too great, for her to distinguish more. She looked after it, as long as its slightest motion was perceptible \u2014 as long as the faintest sound of its footfaU met her ear ; \u2014 and, then, Arith a stifled groan, closed the Avindow again ; and commenced the few remaining preparations she had yet to make, for her long and weary journey. Tbese were soon completed. Overnight, within an hour of Walter's departure, she had ordered her carriage to be at the door on the following morning, at six ; to take ber, while it was still cool, to the station of the raUway by which she was in the habit of travelling to Valmar. She had announced also to old Griffiths her intention of proceeding from there, to the continent, for a Httle time ; referring to tbis change, as to one she had for some time been contemplating, on account of"], [469, "AGNES VALMAR. 137 her health; and on which she had that day decided, in consequence of feeling rather more indisposed than usual. There seemed nothing unnatural in tbis ; for ber appearance and manners during the past month, when unobserved except by do mestics, fully bore out her explanation. It avUI be recoUected, that it was about so long ago, that the cruel conversation took place at her OAvn dinner-table, subse quent to which her decision with regard to the future had almost become fixed. Ever since that time, she had contem plated the possible necessity of some such course as she had now resolved on ; and had prepared for it in every way she con sidered might prove advisable. Among other precautionary measures, she had several times casuaUy mentioned a pro bable excursion of the kind now named, in"], [470, "138 AGNES VALMAR. the hearing of her servants and others. She had also given warning, on various grounds, to those personal attendants, female and male, who would have expected to accompany her : and Griffiths was now suffered to remain under the impression, (which arose unsuggested to his own mind) tbat others, in the place of those to be parted Arith, who were to travel with her, were engaged to meet her at Valmar. Having given the old man whatever in structions were imperative, regarding the management of matters connected Arith tbe London establishment ; and placed in his bands notes of excuse \u2014 on the score of indisposition and consequent temporary absence \u2014 to those at whose houses she had as yet undechned engagements; Agnes finaUy retired to her room \u2014 caused a few of tbe most indispensable articles to be"], [471, "AGNES VALMAR. 139 placed in a smaU cap-ease \u2014 dismissed her maid \u2014 and remained at length alone Avith ber sorrow.

Walter must know more, of course : but as aU sbe was doing was for bim; and as she trusted, that, when be found it done and irrevo cable, he would permit himseh to reap the benefit of it ; be would doubtless keep her secret and bis OAvn. The nearer, however, she approached the moment of carrying her plans into execu tion \u2014 of parting from bim whoUy, tUl such time as he sbould be wedded to his heart's choice \u2014 tbe less confident, after all, she felt, with respect to what his own con duct might be on the discovery of her departure.

Sbe had a lingering dread, that when he found her gone, he might spurn tbe happiness offered to him : tbat, h he knew where to find ber, he would seek her yet ; and claim to do for her, what she had sought to do for him.

It was for tbis object also, (at least tbis was her most cogent reason, though by no means her only one) that she had decided on leaving the country Avithout attendants or equi page. Sbe was, however, anxious to pre vent her dependants from being cognisant of this intention of hers ; partly to avoid exciting surprised conjecture; but stiU more to defeat pursuit, sbould Walter at tempt it.

She endeavoured indeed to Avithdraw herseh altogether; and, as far as was possible, to refrain from the expression of any, merely personal, feeling. Her effort was to throw his at- tention entirely on his own position : and pointing out to him, forcibly, aU which sbe believed rendered the course she left"], [484, "152 AGNES VALMAR. open to him, indispensable for his weU doing and his happiness ; to lead bim to imagine that sbe would find her OAvn, under tbe same disposition of events.

Had tbere been any reproach in her heart towards bim, she would not have suffered it to penetrate \u2014 her aim was aU tbe opposite ; \u2014 but tbere was none. Whatever had occurred, her letter treated \u2014 as indeed sbe honestly con sidered it \u2014 as the necessary result of cir cumstances, anticipated aheady, as be knew, by herself; and for which no pos sible blame attached to him \u2014 no soreness ought to rest, or did rest, on her own mind. Sbe tben declared, in exphcit terms \u2014 in"], [486, "154 AGNES VALMAR. order, as she told bim, that he might feel no lingering hesitation as to his future proceedings; no unnecessary, mistaken qualms of conscience, or fancied honour, in her regard \u2014 that the decision she bad come to was unalterable ; tbat she would not be bis ; and that aU remonstrances, explanations, arguments, tending to turn her from tbat resolution, (were he indeed senseless enough to be willing to employ such, to the prejudice of his own happi ness, his love, his glory, and aU his secret Avishes) would be utterly unavailing. After tbis, she explained, how \u2014 to prove the sincerity and fixedness of her purpose ; and at the same time to free him from any embarrassment or difficulty, which ber pre sence might, perhaps, cause him at tbe first moment \u2014 she had decided on absent ing herseh awhUe : how, in fact, she was"], [487, "155 AGNES VALMAR. aheady gone : and, before he received her letter, would be far beyond reach, and where there was no longer any possibility of his staying her, or even of bis discover ing ber place of retirement. She acknow ledged, that she had taken measures to defeat any attempt haAing tbe latter for its object, (sboiUd he be sufficiently care less of her Avishes and entreaties, to make any) ; and implored him, for his own sake as weU as for hers, to refrain from any expression or act in tbe presence of ber domestics or others, which might lead them to suspect what it was for his in terest, as it was her wish, should remain unguessed. ' If he desired her return,' she said, ' there was but one way of effecting it : by securing his OAvn happiness and worldly welfare, in bis marriage with Lady Lucy"], [488, "156 AGNES VALMAR. \u2014 a person who, from what she had heard of her, she doubted not was deserving of his attachment, and his alhance with whom could not but meet ber entire con sent and approval.' \" And till this is done\" \u2014 so the letter went on \u2014 \"you avUI not see your Httle Gardy again ; nor bear of her, nor know where she may be : for she wiU neither write, nor receive letters, tiU sbe knows it is aU over, and tbat you are happy.

It might occur to her, that that course would better frustrate search, if made, \u2014 aU ports being attainable from tbere, and no clue afforded at which to seek. With a groan of despair, he ac knowledged tbis probability to himseh; and felt, at last, tbat in all human proba bility, bis search was reaUy vain. Some course, however, he must decide on instantly. Reflecting, that at tbe late hour at which he would arrive at South ampton, if he proceeded tbere direct, no vessel would be starting; and tbat be could also, then, obtain Httle intelligence: re flecting, moreover, that he would have time to go to London, and thence reach the former place, while the morning was yet young ; he determined on first ascer taining whether any Hght could be thrown on Agnes's intended movements, at ber"], [505, "173 AGNES VALMAR. house in toAvn.

Tbe first reply he received to his in quiries regarding the departure of the steamers, was destruction to this, his last remaining chance. \" A steamer for Alexandria, touching at Malta, had left the harboiu* a few hours before. No other steamers had left the port that day, or since six o'clock in the morning of the day before. It was not the day for the Havre boats, which sahed only three times a week, then ; and the last of which bad left, the preceding morning, at six. Tbe Gibraltar steamer had left three days ago.

Stretched on her wretched crib, amid the raging waves ; racked equaUy by pangs of body and of mind ; tbe fearful tempest howling above her head, and deadly peril of every kind encompassing her ; poor Agnes lay : Avithout a friendly band to succour, or a friendly voice to cheer. Eor ten days the vessel was in imminent danger; but neither sickness could un nerve, nor perU appal her. Her mind dwelt not on them \u2014 it was far away. \" Ob ! hi have but saved him !

This last new, appalling truth, as it glared fuUy and perfectly upon her, shied up the measure of endurable suffering for Agnes.

When this state passed away, the ship was out of danger, and the storm was lulled.

Walter's impression, regarding Agnes's departure in the Southampton steamer, was an erroneous one; and his other surmise, of her return to London, was equaUy so. She bad taken the inland line, from the station, for a part of its course. Another branch unknown to Walter, some thirty mUes distant, turned off from it, leading Eastward. Agnes had noted tbat a sailing vessel for Hamburg, was to leave from"], [516, "184 AGNES VALMAR.

Leaving the raU way, at tbe nearest point it touched, sbe had posted the remainder of the way to Harwich. In that ship she took her passage. At the moment when Walter, with buoyant step and sparkhng eye, was de scending the royal staircase at Windsor \u2014 a minister, \u2014 Agnes's trembling foot was touching her native soU for the last time : and whUe be was yet hurrying, beside him seh Arith pleasure, to ber expected em brace; the roar of tbe bleak, unfriendly ocean was aheady deafening ber beAril dered ear. At Hamburg, as soon as she was able to"], [517, "185 AGNES VALMAR. leave her bed, she engaged a berth in the first vessel bound for Petersburg; and there, landing, took whatever conveyances of the country she could meet \u2014 still tra veUing northward \u2014 tiU she hid herseh in a remote, unknown deU, in Finland, from every eye. But though Agnes so far persevered in her original determination ; it was not that the thoughts and doubts aroused in the moment of her peril, had died within her ; or been rejected as weakness only. They lived, and weighed heavhy, unceasingly, upon her. Still, she mistrusted herself, and the interest she had in giving weight to them, sufficiently ; to resolve on ad hering steadily to the course she had marked out for herseh\u2014 -for the term to which, when closing her letter to Walter, she had restricted her intended absence."], [518, "186 AGNES VALMAR. Eor she had restricted it \u2014 though we have omitted to name the fact until now ! Her doing so, was, indeed, an after thought \u2014 an accident, if we may term it so \u2014 the result of a sudden, uncontroUable impulse, for which she was whoUy unpre pared, and could give no distinct reason ; but the imperious dictates of which, no self-remonstrance was powerful enough to induce her deliberately to disobey. It arose, when she heard the voice be neath her Avindow ; and, looking out, fol lowed with her eye Walter's retiring form, through the darkness. Something \u2014 sbe knew not what, or how \u2014 was stirred Avithin her by those half heard tones, and by the indistinct vision that floated before ber; which fiUed her mind Arith an instant, dim, undefined dread and sense of uncertainty, such as"], [519, "AGNES VALMAR. 187 she had not once felt tiU that moment.

She had been cautious to guard against any such indirect testimony of ber suffer ing, while Aniting her letter. Her pen had moved steadUy, and tbe pages were"], [522, "190 AGNES VALMAR. spotless ; though her frame was convulsed, and the big drops, aU the whUe sbe wrote, had coursed down her cheeks Hke rain. But in this Postscript, she forgot her cau tion ; and that tear's enduring trace, and the now tremulous, uncertain characters, bore witness, at tbe last, to tbe struggle she bad tUl then concealed so weU. Ah ! how quickly would Walter's heart have understood hers \u2014 and amid aU the pangs of hope deferred, have loved and pitied and forgiven \u2014 had he seen those teU-tale Hnes !

On reaching his home ; before stretching himseh on tbe bed on which he was des tined so long to linger, he had taken the whole \u2014 without again unfolding or looking at any part \u2014 and, enclosing them rapidly in another sheet which he sealed, had locked them up in the place where he kept his most private papers ; with an inward determination to open them or touch them no more, until Agnes was recovered."], [524, "192 AGNES VALMAR.

The Passport offices were first examined : next, the books of aU the hotels and Steam- Packet Companies, at aU the principal ports.

The buoyant Ihe of the young man was his no longer; tbere was no sparkle in his eye, no earnestness in his speech ; no interest, no hope, no aim, ap pearing as before to animate and inspire him. A duU, settled gloom was on his brow : fatigue, apathy \u2014 almost disgust \u2014 spoke in the tones of his voice. \" But are you equal yet, my dear friend,\" said Lord Courtenay to him kindly, Avhen he had noted this painful change, \" Are you equal yet to the exertion?

Erom tbis moment, Walter's time was given entirely to his pubhc avocations. The first among his coUeagues at his post, whether in the office, the councU or the house ; the last to quit it ; he seemed to have no thought for pleasure, no desire for relaxation.

Walter's services to bis cause were as effective as ever, and in aU respects he seemed equally worthy of tbe good opinion Lord Courtenay had en tertained of him from the first. The Premier's former desire, therefore, for an alhance between Walter and his niece, was again aroused ; and whatever depended on him tbat might assist in bringing it about, he did.

But then he was guarded by a bulwark, before which all weapons fell harmless as the arrow from tbe rock ; now, he bad nothing to defend bim \u2014 nothing he cared to de fend. His Agnes was lost to him for ever. He never once doubted it, from tbe moment be found sbe bad, seriously and delibe rately, placed herseh beyond possible reach.

What cared he, then, what be did, or whose he was ?

Parted irrevocably from her, what was it to him what became of bim, or who called him husband ? Har dened, embittered as be felt even towards herseh now, be still could not brook the idea of being the means (as seemed Hkely h he did not marry) of perpetuating her self-banishment. \" Let her come back,\" he said to himseh,"], [534, "202 AGNES VAXMAR. \" Let her come back, and Avitness the hap piness she has Avrought !\" Under the influence of tbese feehngs, after a time, he bent to the stream ; and suffered himseh to be tbroAvn into Lady Lucy's society, as often, and for as long, as she and Lord Courtenay pleased. She was lovely, as we have said \u2014 ex ceedingly so. Dehcate, chiseUed features, an exquisite mouth, soft rich bah, nearly black, braided on a brilliantly white fore head ; large hazel eyes set in long dark Hds ; a figure above the common height, faultless in form and beautifully rounded ; with perfect manners, fuU of high-bred re pose ; together formed an ensemble of at traction, such as tbe most fastidious taste could not but approve, and \u2014 once attention aroused to it \u2014 admire. During Walter's former frequent juxta-"], [535, "AGNES VALMAR. 203 position Arith her, though be knew she was lovely, it was a mere abstract knowledge : Her beauty made no impression on his mind, or on bis senses : He never thought about it. The love he bore Agnes, bis veneration for ber character, the number less dear associations which attached him by a thousand imperceptible threads to her and her alone ; prevented him from being more than barely conscious of tbe attrac tions of any other. When, even, his ob servation was forcibly directed to another's personal charms, \u2014 however superior tbese might be to Agnes's \u2014 the fact made no difference to him ! It was not beauty, be loved in Agnes ; though, because he loved her, her features and everything about ber were of course pleasing and fascinating in his eyes. He loved herseh.

What other woman, were sbe beautiful as an angel, could be ah this to him ? What other woman, under any possible circumstances, could take ber place ? Could Hfe a second time build up an attachment so grounded, so endeared, so firmly knit ? It was impossible.

Nevertheless, now, tbat that dream was roughly broken, and for ever gone, \u2014 unoc cupied, in so far as tbe world of inner feel ing was concerned, lonely and sad, \u2014 he turned at last, with a sense of something like relief and reviving interest, to the"], [537, "205 AGNES VALMAR. friendly hearth where aU his wishes were consulted and forestaUed, and to the beau tiful face which ahvays snhled a welcome to him.

Eor a couple of weeks, he did not appear at Lord Courtenay's ; and the latter's repeated inquiries (which Walter rephed to by a report of some un important though troublesome indisposi tion) testified to the anxiety experienced on bis behalf. His absence did indeed require explana tion : for, insensibly, Walter had become a daUy visitant at Lord Courtenay's house ; a seat was always kept for him at bis table ; and, for tbe preceding month or two, few had been the evenings he had spent else where.

He was stih further inclined to think her ladyship was unweU, when she came down in the afternoon, to leave for good, \u2014 she looked so much Avorse then. She had caUed for no refreshment while she stayed. Indeed, he had made bold, when she was leaving, to press some on her, and to endeavour to persuade her not to encounter any further fatigue that night : but she had rephed, \" It wras nothing but the ah* of London, which stifled ber : She found she could not bear it yet, but hoped before long to be able to do so.

On reaching his rooms, the determina tion of Walter's hardened mind had been, to remain there, and never to rejoin bis wife or her famUy again.

His worthier feelings partly re-awakened by tbese reflections ; thoughts of what he owed his Avife and Lord Courtenay, began, next, to find their way into his mind. ' What right had he to grieve and to in sult them, by a course such as he had whdly proposed to himseh ? If they bad been tbe indirect means of seahng his wretchedness, it had been unconsciously on their parts : the blame was bis, not theirs. Lord Courtenay had ever shoAvn him true kindness. Lady Lucy liked him, he did not doubt, as much as her passive nature enabled ber to like anybody. And though he could never again feel warmly, in his heart, towards either, or be reaUy"], [569, "237 AGNES VALMAR. at ease, henceforward, in their society ; he bad no right to repay friendly offices and intentions by unjust, unmanly outrage. What would Agnes say and feel at his so acting ? Did he not know intuitively \u2014 however it might tend to prove the inten sity of the love he had borne herseh \u2014 that it would be tbe crueUest shock her pure mind could receive ; that it would divide her from him more than all else ?

No word, no clue of any description whatever, by which Lord Charles could form a guess of Maldon's further purposes, or of the land to which be intended to bend his steps. The blow was a heavy one to him ; heavier than even be himseh could have beheved, tUl tbe trial came. It was now nearly three years (with the exception only of the interval spent by Walter in search of Agnes) since be had been in habits of daily intimacy with Walter ; and, spite of the attachment both"], [703, "61 AGNES VALMAR. cherished for tbe same woman, he had learned to love him as a brother. Nay, it was perhaps that very attachment \u2014 one which, had they possessed lower and Aveaker minds or less generous hearts, Avould have severed them entirely \u2014 that originally drew them together. The total absence of hope on Lord Charles's side ; and the certainty, on Walter's, that, whether united to himseh or not, Agnes Avould never transfer her affections to another ; contributed no doubt greatly to this result. Indeed, had these convictions been less profound, such a result would have been impossible : it would not have been in nature. As it was, the affection which Lord Charles knew Lady Valmar felt for Walter, invested him with a sort of tender, hah-sacred, character in his eyes. In loving him and in befriending bim, he"], [704, "62 AGNES VALMAR. seemed, in an indirect manner, to be serving her; and Walter's oavii good quahties completed tbe work, which Lord Charles's love and veneration for Agnes had begun. The sudden, unexpected Anench given by Walter's disastrous resolution to his friend's affections and to his habits, shat tered in a moment, and destroyed, what bad become one of tbe principal objects and interests of tbe latter's Ihe. Walter's loss made a blank in bis existence which \u2014 since Agnes could not be his \u2014 he felt nothing could ever fiU up. But it was worse, when he reflected on the evUs and dangers to which he pictured to himseh his friend exposed. Without pecuniary resources ; Avithout friends ; without a goal of any kind before his eyes ; Avithout even a name, in tbe strange lands be meant to seek, to preserve from"], [705, "AGNES VALMAR. 63 blot; what might not be the risks, the temptations, he might undergo ? \u2014 what tbe awful result on his character and con duct \u2014 even overlooking, for tbe moment, tbe mental pain and hopelessness which, in the mean time, would be his portion ? He, lately so favoured by fortune, so high placed; not long since so admired, so looked up to \u2014 and so happy ! \u2014 It was dreadful \u2014 it was heart-breaking ! \u2014 All Lord Charles's habitual serenity and self command, were overthrown by the mise rable event. He would have deplored his friend's death, less than this ! When his mind reverted to Lady Val mar, however, bis own grief and appre hensions were merged in bis contemplation of tbat far mightier sorrow. What would not be her trial ?

Three months would soon come round, and the awful stroke \u2014 ber death-stroke perhaps \u2014 must be dealt ber by his hand ! Hoav much of this woe, Maldon might have spared her, was a reflection that could not but follow in the wake of the others in Lord Charles's mind, and help stUl more to oppress it. ' Why leave them both in torturing ig norance as to his doom ? Why scornfully reject aU rehabilitation ? Why deprive himseh of means, of power, alike for ease of Hfe, and usefulness ? It seemed heart less of him ; cruel, ungrateful to her, wrbo, in aU she had done, had had no thought but for bim, Avhose trial, Avithout this, was as hard and as heavy as his.' While Lord Charles ruminated on these things, in the midst of all his deep regret VOL. III. F"], [708, "66 AGNES VALMAR. and regard for his lost friend, an unwiVh'ng feehng of indignation against him entered his mind. Eor the first time, he doubted if Walter was entirely worthy of Agnes ; for tbe first time, be thought Avithin him self, tbat bad ber peace been his blessed charge, be would have better cherished tbe dear, the sacred trust. In this partial condemnation, reluctant and painful as it was, even Lord Charles was, in some respects, unconsciously harsh on the poor wanderer. He had not read Agnes's letter to Wal ter. He did not know she bad said that, if Walter and bis whe were not reconcUed, they, too, coifld never meet ; that if blood was spilt, they were parted for ever: or if it occurred to him, from a sentence in Maldon' s letter to himseh, that words of some such import had been used, he did"], [709, "AGNES VALMAR. 67 not attach to them the signification or the weight, they bore to Walter's mind. Knowing bow intense had been Agnes's anxiety to prevent the duel and the sepa ration ; and bow, for this object, she bad probably sought to impress on Walter every consideration that would most for cibly influence bim to adopt tbe course sbe thought right and necessary ; Lord Charles paid little or no attention to this passage in Walter's letter, and was quite unaware of the jiowerful effect those ex pressions of Agnes's to which it referred, had bad on him, and of the perfectly literal sense in which he had understood them. In passing judgment, too, on Walter's perseverance after the crisis was past, in the course projected at a moment of deeply excited and outraged feeling, Lord f2"], [710, "68 AGNES VALMAR. Charles did not sufficiently consider the fact, tbat Walter left tbe country believ ing Lord Courtenay bad died on tbe ground, and ignorant of all that had passed since, tending to exculpate bim in the eyes of the world and facilitate bis rehabilitation. Tbe laws were now so stringently en forced in affairs of tbis kind, and tbe case was one apparently of such aggrava tion and so likely to be treated Avith tbe utmost severity, that it was by no means unnatural Maldon should have beheved \u2014 as he did \u2014 tbat his return, as a free and undisgraced man, was impossible. Another feeling, also, powerfully in fluencing Walter, was too much overlooked by Lord Charles ; namely, his horror \u2014 whatever the provocation received \u2014 at the deed itself which had been committed by"], [711, "AGNES VALMAR. 69 his band : the keen remorse which fol lowed him \u2014 which he knew beforehand, were the event what it proved, would fol low him \u2014 for having caused the death of him be bad long so sincerely valued, with whom he bad so intimately Hved, who once had shown him so much true and Avarm attachment. If Walter was cul pable, be paid sorely \u2014 as the guUty ever do \u2014 for the wrong he did. His was no light, lenient punishment : Even his bo som friend guessed Httle hoAV heavy and sharp it was. Only Agnes \u2014 to whom every turn of bis mind and heart were knoAvn \u2014 only sbe could guess it. MeanwhUe, it was of her trial that Lord Charles now principally thought ; of that, and of what it might be in bis own power to do, in any way to Hgbten it. In furtherance of this paramount object,"], [712, "70 AGNES VALMAR. bis first act was to seek some trace of Maldon, if such were yet to be obtained. The principal in the late fatal affair being beyond the reach of justice, Lord Charles, as second merely, incurred comparatively Httle risk of disturbance. StUl, he deter mined to take every precaution, least tem porary detention sbould interfere with his efforts. Besolving, therefore, to postpone a Httle whUe the pubhc exculpation of his friend, he repaired at once \u2014 partiaUy dis guised as be was \u2014 to the spot where tbe duel had been fought ; delaying only to forward to his father Maldon' s official resignation, for delivery in the proper quarter. AU Lord Charles's inquiries proved un availing. He discovered the horse, indeed, on which Walter bad ridden away \u2014 a favourite animal remarkable for its fleet-"], [713, "71 AGNES VALMAR. ness, which Lord Charles learned a groom had been directed, an hour before the duel took place, to take and attach where be had seen it \u2014 the groom himself having got orders to quit tbe place as soon as he saw the carriage drive up. The animal had been found straying some fifteen miles from the spot, in a field near which high roads and raUways branched off in various directions ; but the closest and most dili gent scrutiny saUed to elicit anything further. Lord Charles then commenced a series of investigations at the different ports, re garding the departures which had taken place within the time. These occupied many weeks \u2014 but to no purpose. In the mean time, \u2014 Lord Ashborough having, at his son's request, represented to the proper authorities the nature of the"], [714, "72 AGNES VALMAR. testimony the latter had to give, and the Marquis's interest being considerable, \u2014 it Avas intimated tbat Lord Charles might return, without prejudice to bis liberty except for tbe briefest possible space. Despairing now of recalhng Walter, Lord Charles's next duty was, of course, to clear his character, by making pubhc tbe statements made to him by Lord Courtenay. This he did, in the amplest manner : and though the horror and indignation excited in the country, by tbe premature and tragical death of one so admired and holding so high a position as tbe late Premier \u2014 at the bands too of so near a connexion \u2014 were great, (so much so as to make it evident that, were a trial then to take place, it would, notwithstanding Lord Courtenay's dying declaration, go bard with Walter), Nevertheless, he bad tbesatisfac-"], [715, "73 AGNES VALMAR. tion to find, that in private society, among the classes with whom they both mixed, the feehng against the latter became quickly greatly modified, if not entirely effaced. He foresaw\", tbat when a certain period of time had elapsed, and the pubhc mind, becoming occupied by other more recent events, had cooled on the subject ; Maldon might return, without suffering any really serious consequences from what had oc curred. But of what avaU was this, when Walter had already condemned and expatriated himseh, and placed it beyond tbe power of time or friends to serve bim ?

CHAPTEB VI. At last tbe three months were ended ; and tbe looked-for missive came. Lady Valmar was safe at least, and her abode no longer unknoAvn. The next day, Lord Charles took tem porary leave of bis famUy \u2014 without, how ever, mentioning, even to them, for what object he was absenting himseh \u2014 and started, to communicate in person to Agnes the gloomy intehigence ; and to bear to"], [717, "AGNES VALMAR. 75 her, according to his pledge, Walter's last painful message, and tbe papers he had no alternative but to place in ber bands.

This was no time, and these were no events, for observing ordinary puncthios. It never occurred to Lord Charles, at such a moment, that he was visiting Agnes in a lone retirement \u2014 be, a former lover, whose presence there under such chcumstances, if knoAvn to the gossiping world, would fill its thousand mouths Arith scandal's venomed breath.

Without hesitation, therefore \u2014 his whole soul occupied only Arith the one feeling, of how best he could lessen the severity of the impending blow \u2014 Lord Charles sought Agnes in tbe strange, unknown spot her letter designated. He neared it at length. What a retreat bad she chosen ! In Avhat a dismal, cheerless sohtude had she spent more than two long years ; she, who bad at ber command aU that wealth and rank could shower on the most favoured ; she, who might have chosen her life's partner, had sbe so wiUed, from among tbe highest and the worthiest of tbe land she left!

Sbe had made friends of them, and they repaid her care. They were her chUdren, her companions. They never wounded; eA^er smiled on her and welcomed her ; they deceived her never \u2014 and they never left her till they died ! Books \u2014 instruments \u2014 she had none. Books, could she have procured them, would have been useless to her; Her mind was elsewhere.

Music were worse : Its tones would have maddened her \u2014 sbe could not play! Sbe wrote. Sbe poured forth, to the dumb, senseless paper, tbe thoughts, tbe feelings which no human breast but hers should ever know. That was her Ihe! \u2014 Her flowers ber only relaxation \u2014 Her tears her only excitement. Tbe rest \u2014 except in tbe good sbe did to tbe humble folk around \u2014 was vacancy ! Two native peasants, brother and sister \u2014 joint owners of the cottage sbe bad chosen for her abode \u2014 alone ministered to her physical wants. At first she had reaUy lodged with them ; occupying a sort of spare room, which served to bold theh hohday toggery, the produce of the sister's spinning, tbe brother's hunting and fish-"], [721, "AGNES VALMAR. 79 ing apparatus, implements of husbandry, &c. It was fitted, however, also, with the requisites for a bedroom ; and in it, at rare intervals \u2014 the lumber being removed \u2014 tbe clergyman of tbe district, grand relatives from afar, or passing traveUers, were, on occasion, lodged. Here Agnes bad dwelt a month or two ; whUe two other rooms were being con structed, on the other side of the cottage, for her exclusive use. BuUt of tbe ready felled timber of the forests near, tbe new rooms sprung quickly up. Theh simple furniture, brought by water from tbe nearest coast-toAvn, was fetched mean whUe; and, before the second month was passed, Agnes entered on the privacy, which, except during her two brief and miserable visits to England, had never been broken in upon, tUl now. When Lord Charles reached the place,"], [722, "80 AGNES VALMAR. the summer had clothed the land with verdure, the vast woods with foliage ; and tbere was not wanting a stern grandeur in the wild scenery, which could not fail to have a certain gloomy charm for those whose thoughts were solemn and deep shadowed Hke itself. Eor Aore than half the year, however, tbe ice-bound soil dis played no green thing : bleakness and sUence reigned over all. Why had sbe chosen a spot so comfortless, so desolate ? Lord Charles once asked her why ? \" I knewr he would not seek me here ;\" she rephed, \" but, sought or unsought, it suited me.

Alarmed at the possible consequences of his precipitation, Lord Charles was rising hastily, when she motioned him not to stir. \" Go on now,\" she Avhispered, after a short pause : \" Begin, from when you left me.\" He did so. He told her all : \u2014 his first meeting with Walter, after quitting her ; the change her letter worked; the con tents and rejection of the one Walter wrote Lord Courtenay ; bis oavu interview with the latter; \u2014 Then Walter's visit, and appeal to his Avife, with its painful termi nation ; bis last charges to himself on the morning of the duel; The meeting, its dread result, and Walter's flight; \u2014 And, lastly, bis OAvn summons to Lord Cour-"], [728, "86 AGNES VALMAR. tenay's bed, and aU tbat tbere bad passed.

It takes time to detail tbese reflections and resolves, but a minute sufficed to mature them in Lord Charles's mind; and his course was shaped out, long ere tbe object of them had strength to reply a word to tbe melancholy relation be bad just concluded.

If nothing could be learned Avithin a month, he was to come to Vahnar to devise other measures Arith Agnes. The parting between them had been sad on both sides. Gratitude was stirring and warm in Agnes's heart.

But what was any pain, any privation, if there were the remotest chance of its leading to Walter's return ? She felt, in deed, more for Lord Charles than for her seh: for she knew how mucb more tbat parting was to him ; and she grieved, sincerely, that so much exceUence, so much sterling, generous attachment, could meet only Avith such poor return.

His disinte-"], [763, "AGNES VALMAR. 121 rested regard for Agnes and for Agnes's weU-being, had made him eager she should come home ; and he had urged it, Avithout permitting a thought of what he indi viduaUy would lose, to weaken his efforts.

He did not, on that account, waver ; but be would have been more than man if he had not regretted.

When each reached, therefore, theh different destinations, they would reaUy be separated more, than tbey had been whUe Agnes and Walter were yet together.

Lord Ashborough's intimate con nexion Arith the principal members of the administration, enabled Lord Charles to organise a regular system of search, by their means, which to most persons would have been utterly impracticable : and Lady Valmar's boundless wealth, rendered the defrayal of aU expense entaded by the employment of subordinates, easy."], [766, "124 AGNES VALMAR.

To Lord Charles also, tbe event of Lady Lucy's death was productive of an in creased dejection, from which be could not cast himseh free. What he experienced, was not difficult to be accounted for. Lord Charles desired Lady Vahnar's happiness too earnestly, not to have been quickly re concUed to any event tending to secure it ; and had Walter been in England, or bad tbere been any reasonable prospect of his ever returning there, no personal feeling would have occupied his generous mind a moment. But be firmly beheved \u2014 as Agnes did, or thought she did \u2014 that Wal ter, whether dead or living, would never"], [781, "139 AGNES VALMAR. be beard of by either one or the other, again. Convinced, therefore, that any expectation of his and Agnes's restoration to each other, was utterly vain and futile ; Ids sole remaining desire had been, to see Lady Valmar become at length resigned to what was irremediable, and able to derive consolation from whatever other sources of pleasure and interest remained open to her. Whether be also nourished any definite hope, that, one day, she might be brought to suffer him to afford that consolation, we cannot distinctly pronounce. \u2014 Probably, he knew not himseh.

She Avould never, by any act of hers, place, a second time, a barrier between herseh and Walter. Unless, therefore, she had certain intelligence of Walter's death; or unless Walter himseh, if bring, proved himseh altered towards her, and disclaimed aU future thought or wish of ever being hers ; there could no longer be any alteration in his own individual prospects. Since both"], [783, "AGNES VALMAR. 141 these events were beyond reasonable cal culation; and neither could take place, without causing such additional grief to Agnes, that, far from desiring them, his most earnest Avish was, they might never happen ; Lord Charles felt his OAvn future as regarded Agnes, in a manner sealed by Lady Lucy's death. He watched Agnes narrowly, after the event had become known ; and he saw that he bad not been deceived. There was a restlessness in her manner henceforward, which, before its occurrence, had graduaUy died away: and when they spoke of Walter \u2014 which latterly they bad done less and less, for Lord Charles had begun to try to turn her thoughts to other tilings, and did not of bis own accord name bim now \u2014 he observed a change of colour, a failing of her voice, a tremulousness in her"], [784, "142 AGNES VALMAR. whole person, which gave certain indica tion of the renewed excitement of her feehngs. Not a syUable, however, did Agnes ever say, in confirmation of these sUent evidences.

Nearly seven years had now elapsed since Walter's loss \u2014 nearly ten since the period of his first return to England \u2014 when, one day, as Lord Charles chanced to be sitting Avith Agnes at Valmar, a foreign-looking letter, soiled, crumpled, torn, Avas put into the former's band.

It had arrived very soon after Lord Charles had left the house \u2014 forwarded from the Eoreign-Office, \u2014 and the Marquis, thinking it might be of importance, had sent a groom Arith it by tbe first train. One thought possessed Lord Charles and Agnes, at tbe same moment : but neither uttered a word. Lord Charles, scarcely less agitated than Agnes, kept the letter in his band, Avithout daring to open it. He looked at the Post marks. That of Capetowu was the only one, of a place be knew. Another, which the letter also bore, seemed probably tbat of some settlement further in the interior.

When he thought ber sufficiently pre pared, he read her the letter itseh. It was from the brother of the British Consul of Capetown, to whom, among others, the directions before mentioned concerning Walter, bad been sent ; and who bad, in consequence, given instruc tions on tbe subject to two or three per sons in his employ, which these kept in mind. One of these latter, having been de spatched, on some trading business, to the l2"], [790, "148 AGNES VALMAR. inland boundaries of the settlement ; had casuaUy heard, there, tbat an Englishman Avas lying, at a considerable distance far ther up tbe country, among tbe natives, in a most precarious state. On inquiry of the traveUers who bad brought the infor mation, (a heterogeneous party of despe rate hunters, Dutch, Enghsh and natives, Avho had just returned from a long and perUous exploring expedition) he found the EngHshman's danger arose from an accident, received when hunting a herd of the wUd Rhinoceros of the locality : and that, as it was utterly impossible \u2014 even should be survive, which was very un certain \u2014 tbat he could move from where be Avas, for a very long time, tbey had left lum to his fate. He had been carried, however, to one of tbe huts of the natives ; and tbe companions who had deserted him,"], [791, "AGNES VALMAR. 149 had done their best to interest tbese people in taking Avhat care they could of him, by promises of future reward. Eurther investigation caused the Consul's Agent to suspect \u2014 both from the descrip tion of bis person, and from various other trifling circumstances, especiaUy some words which had faUen from him after his accident \u2014 that tbis Englishman might be the Mr. Maldon of whom they bad so long been in search. He made, in consequence, close inquiry of every individual of the party, and at last found reason to feel almost positive of the fact. One of the hunters \u2014 who had undressed the injured man, while the latter was in a state of in sensibUity from loss of blood \u2014 asserted, that he bad found in bis breast a pocket-book with the initials W.

On hearing tbis account, the Consul's Agent resolved, in pursuance of his former instructions, and regardless of the diffi culties and dangers of the journey, to start immediately for the spot where Mr. Mal don \u2014 as he scarcely now doubted it was \u2014 lay. He did so accordingly ; taking with him a surgeon, supplies of medicine, food, raiment, bedding, and whatever else might be necessary for tbe sufferer's preservation and comfort; besides materials for con structing a Htter in which he might be"], [793, "AGNES VALMAR. 151 carried, and men enough to bear bim and to protect the expedition. One of tbe party just returned, consented, for a round sum, to act as guide. Before starting, the Agent wrote full particulars to the Consul, requesting his further instructions. On receiving this communication, the Consul, entertaining little doubt of the Enghshman's being in deed tbe gentleman for whom Lord Charles Tremorne was interested, at once made up his mind to send his OAvn brother (the writer) to seek him and to attend to him in person. He Avas now on his way ; and Anote from the same boundary settlement where the intelligence was first obtained.

When he reached the place from which he now wrote, he had found a second letter from his brother's Agent; sent there on the chance of the Consul's deciding on some such course as he had adopted. It stated, that the Englishman had been found, stdl in a very uncertain condition ; and that it might be very long yet, before it would be prudent to attempt removing him even to the boundary settlement. He Avas delirious at the time of the Agent's arriving ; and tbe latter bad not been near bim an hour, when be heard him, among a hundred broken, incoherent sentences, say distinctly, in an excited tone, \" No, Tre morne, never.\" A sudden thought struck the Agent, on bearing tbis ; namely, that he might per-"], [795, "AGNES VALMAR. 153 haps place the sufferer's identity beyond question, Avithout his being himseh aware that it was discovered, by touching a chord in bis memory. He accordingly answered his unconscious apostrophe, by addressing him, in a loud, impressive voice, by the name of Walter Maldon. The result had answered bis' expectation. Tbe delirious man started violently, and endeavoured to rise, repeating bis own name \u2014 asking, wUdly, who caUed it \u2014 and crying out, ' be was no longer Walter Maldon.' Then fall ing back, he burst into a fit of tears. He had slept, however, afterwards ; the fever had abated a Httle ; and tbe delirium bad not returned. Everything had since been done that was possible under the circumstances, to contribute to his recovery, and to his pre sent bodUy relief. His wounds, which"], [796, "154 AGNES VALMAR. were in a frightful state, had been dressed ; and the violent external and internal in flammation which were found to exist, had been aUayed somewhat by the measures pursued. Hopes were entertained tbat he might ultimately be saved ; and, if he were, there was no reason to dread any enduring eAil consequences from the disaster, since no vital part was permanently injured. Though a limb was broken, it had been successfully set, and, if be recovered, would probably be as strong as before the acci dent. At the same time, his friends should be warned not to be too sanguine, because, in his present condition, it was impossible to say what a day might bring forth ; and he might be gone, therefore, long and long before tbe news of bis being discovered, could reach them. They sbould also, even at the best, be prepared for his being"], [797, "AGNES VALMAR. 155 very long confined ; as bis debility would be excessive, after the riolent measures needful to reduce tbe inflammation and fever; and bis fractured limb would, in any case, oblige him to remain Avithout exertion or motion of any kind, for a con siderable period. Under these circumstances (the Avriter said) he conceived there would undoubtedly be time for a communication from Lord Charles to be received, before Mr. Maldon would be able to withdraw from the party. And in order to lessen, if possible, what ever desire of the kind Mr. Maldon might feel, be promised tbat the latter should be kept, meanwhde, entirely in ignorance \u2014 not only of the fact of his name being knoAvn \u2014 but also, of tbat of the Aniter's being related to any one holding an official situation in the settlement.

Lord Charles was requested to direct his reply to the boundary settlement, whence the Consul's brother wrote. Perhaps, by the time it reached, tbe whole party might have arrived so far, and be estabhshed tbere awaiting it ; for no further advance would oil any account be volunteered, or (if it could be helped) permitted, even were Mr. Maldon equal to it, lest of the latter taking tbe alarm at tbe idea of approach ing the Cape too nearly, and quitting them."], [799, "AGNES VALMAR. 157 Should they be stUl among the natives, Lord Charles's letter Avould be forwarded instantly by the person under cover to whom it was to be addressed, and who should receive aU the requisite directions.

She urged nothing, she suggested nothing; but she fixed an anxious, imploring eye on Lord Charles, which told far better than language, what was passing in her breast.

Tbere was a time, indeed, when no feeling with which pride or reserve had anything to do, could have found place in her breast where Walter was concerned. Then, if either gave the other pain, but one impulse moved them both \u2014 to speak at once and set it right : if either were wrong, the wrong was freely confessed, \u2014 a few words of mutual, frank inquiry and explanation, and the light cloud passed away and was forgotten.

But at length the subject tbat was secretly uppermost in both theh minds, found, by imperceptible degrees, place in tbeir conversation. Lord Charles approached it careftdly, sounding each depth as he went on ; and with such disheartening results, that, for a long whUe, he almost despaired of altering in any way tbe resolution of him be had come so far to seek. \"I am an outlaw,\" persisted Walter; \" Murder is marked against my name : and the time-serving world I left behind me,"], [828, "186 AGNES VALMAR. wUl have found no greater palhation for that deed, than it did for the others, for which, without a bearing, I was, before, put to its ban.

Before speaking directly of Lady Valmar, he then contrived to make Walter aware that his Arise was no more ; returning, however, immediately to the former subject, Avith out seeming to notice the impression the news made on his hearer.

If Walter's oavu, therefore, did not spontaneously lead him to her, Lord Charles saw himseh almost powerless ; and, fettered as be was, it might be even impossible to him to dis cover, bow far Walter's backwardness \u2014 sbould be show it \u2014 might arise from altered sentiments, from present indiffe rence to her be bad once loved, or from wounded pride, and hurt affection, at tbe fact of ber not expressing, on her side, any anxiety for their reunion."], [831, "189 AGNES VALMAR. But Lord Charles was as yet only feel ing his way : As yet Lady Valmar's name had not been mentioned by either. When, however, he thought he per ceived Walter wavering in bis resolution, he seized the moment to add, that ' there were other reasons also, why Walter should yield to his representations. It was not of himseh, only, be should think : there were others, whom the uncertainty regard ing his fate had plunged into affliction ; whose earnest hope and prayer it was, that he might be restored to his country and to society. Maldon could not doubt the intense interest Lady Valmar took in this result ; he would, surely, never give her the pang of learning that he \u2014 Lord Charles \u2014 had returned, and left him a roving exUe still.' Eor a considerable time, Lord Charles"], [832, "190 AGNES VALMAR. continued speaking in tbis strain ; hoping, every moment, tbat some remark, some gesture, of Walter's, might indicate to him tbe state of bis mind. But be was deceived completely in tbis expectation.

When he paused, stUl Walter re mained sUent, immoveable, \u2014 ArithdraAvn pertinaciously from Lord Charles's search ing eye.

Whether there was bit terness, resentment, in bis breast, \u2014 or whether he merely wished to avoid the subject, feehng bis OAvn heart changed, but unwilling to say a word which might savour of hardness or indifference, \u2014 or whether any other feehng to which he did not choose to give utterance, was work ing within him \u2014 Lord Charles could not teU ; but the fact was such as he had described. At last the day approached on which the surgeon had pronounced that Walter might travel Avith safety. That day was"], [834, "192 AGNES VALMAR. within one Aveek only of Lord Charles's arrival. A week later, and he might have found bim gone ! StiU, Walter bad given no indication of Avhat his intentions might be. Lord Charles consequently deter mined on making a last appeal, and re quiring from him a reply, at-aU-events, be it what it might. He repeated aU he had before urged with redoubled earnest ness, and then told bim he awaited his answer. \" You have nothing else to say to me, Tremorne ?\" Walter asked, when be had concluded, \"nothing further from your- self .... or from .... any other!\" \" I do not remember anything more I can say.\" Walter was mute, again, for a long while. \" I shaU go with you,\" be then said,"], [835, "AGNES VALMAR. 193 slowly. \"It is wished I should be reha bUitated \u2014 I consent.

He did not place enough to the account of that Pride \u2014 that backwardness in outward demonstra tion where he bad met any, even tbe slightest, check \u2014 which bad always made part of Walter's character.

And Walter, too, had watched for a Avord from Lord Charles's lips, inviting him, in Agnes's name, to renew those ties, \u2014 and none had met his ear !

Walter's public associations, on one side, and Lord Charles's devotion of bis time to Agnes, on tbe other, \u2014 and, more than either of these, tbe feehngs of partial mistrust and disapprobation which Walter's conduct had generated in Lord Charles's mind, \u2014 had kept them much asunder. \" You here \u2014 so far \u2014 aU alone !\" was the spontaneous exclamation of both. \"Yes; come to amuse myseh,\" \u2014 or something tantamount \u2014 was the equally spontaneous answer. There was a touch of melancholy in the manner and tone of both, which passed unnoticed by neither, and which struck a responsive chord in both theh bosoms. \"Let us muse together,\" said Lord Charles, putting bis arm in Walter's.

Each felt the other was sad ; and theh hearts were drawn to each other by tbat intuitive conviction, more than tbey bad ever been since Walter's return. Tbere was a gentleness too about Walter, now, such as bis friend bad not once \u2014 or only once \u2014 since, seen in him, and which touched Lord Charles greatly ; reviving ah his old feelings of attachment, and, with them, better opinions of Walter, past and present, than he bad felt able for a long time to entertain. \" Walter,\" suddenly said Lord Charles,"], [897, "255 AGNES VALMAR. \"WiU you come home with me to my lodge ?

Some weighty thought appeared to engross his mind entirely. Walter set about examining and cleaning the fire-arms, and settling the fishing tackle; and an hour or two passed, thus, in silence. \"I start for America in a fortnight, Walter,\" was Lord Charles's first remark.

Directly this thought confirmed itseh in his mind, he forgot himself entirely, and his OAvn loss. He even shuddered at what he had so recently been urging on Agnes ; at the fresh misery Avith which he might have been tbe means of loading both her and Walter, had not her OAvn true, change less, faithful heart, preserved herseh and them. His own course was decided on, instantly : namely, to absent himseh awhde ; and to let Walter understand why he did so, and know, distinctly, that he had no rival in him.

To effect bis purpose, be saw it would be necessary be should visit Agnes again immediately. So soon after what had passed between them, this visit was a severe trial to him; but he made up bis mind to it, nevertheless, without a second's hesitation.

She was evidently moved at seeing him ; but sbe held out her band to him frankly, affectionately ; and there was a gleam of sincere and lively pleasure in ber face, which went to Lord Charles's soul, and, for a few mo ments, almost made him forget the errand he had come upon. \" I thought you had deserted me,\" she said, in a soft, touched voice. \" This is kind of you \u2014 very, very kind, \u2014 I am so glad.
