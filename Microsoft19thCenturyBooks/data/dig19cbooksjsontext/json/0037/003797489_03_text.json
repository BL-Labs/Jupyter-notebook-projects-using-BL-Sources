CHAPTER I. UNDER THE KINDLY MOON. The storm had blown itself out. There were no long scudding clouds driving across the disc of the peaceful moon, hiding her cheery, inquisitive, mischief- seeing face. She had come up in all her glory and thrown a shining streak across the broad bosom of the long waved Atlantic, like a baldric of gold on the breastplate of Thor ; the night was beautiful with stars, and the wind was singing softly its wondrous song of the sea. The good ship \" Scotia \" ploughed her swift way over the waves with flogging paddles and straining sails. Her course for an hour had led her right along the golden moon -track, and, lured by the tales of the soft beauty of the night, her passengers, storm-rolled and wind-whipped for three days, were leaving vol. in. 33"], [14, "2 TWO PARDONS. cabin, saloon, and berth, to bask in the glorious light that brightened all the deck, save where it threw dark shadow of mast, or spar, or sail. In couples, in knots, and in rings, they grouped themselves, and some with song or merry tale, and some with graver talk, passed the hour before turning in. Among the quieter passengers, who talked unheedful of the gaiety and melody of the larger groups, were two with whom we have especially to deal. They sat on deck chairs at a part of the vessel not favoured by the more jovial com panies, Galbraith smoking, and both for a long time silent. Yet they were not sad. In the heart of one of them was bounding a wild joy, a sense of gratified desire and fulfilled hope that made it surely one of the lightest in the ship, and the other was happy in recovered freedom, hi regained manhood, in emancipated mind and unrestrained limbs. But silence is the luxury of joy, and their very happiness kept them mute. Harry Galbraith was bearing back to Eno-. land, to fight, to life, the brother whom he had mourned as dead. Reginald Wilding was leaving behind him"], [15, "UNDER THE KINDLY7 MOON. 3 the horrid gloom of insanity, the lonely room, the unsympathetic faces of his attendants, the despair of his lucid moments, the nameless horrors of a brain uncurbed by reason ; leaving them behind him as we leave behind us a bad dream, at the very unreality of which we shudder when we wake. Every turn of the mighty engines bore one farther away from all that was most dreadful in his life, and carried the other nearer and nearer to love, to friends, to home. Reginald Wilding; was the first to break the silence. \" I think I have found my sea-legs at last, Harry,\" he said ; \" I shall get used to it, and be as good a sailor as ever ; will you give me one of your cigars ? I can venture on one safely now.\" Galbraith handed him his case, and the half brothers sat smoking and talking. \" What a glorious night ! \" said Reginald Wilding, and added in a lower tone, \" and how sweet it is to be free. I never thought I should see the Atlantic again. I have been buried for twelve years.\" \" Forget them,\" said Galbraith, laying his hand on that of his brother ; \" there is a new 33\u20142"], [16, "4 TWO PARDONS. life opening out to you now, Reggie ; you must think no more of the old one ; please God, that will never return, the old Squire says.\" \" Tell me about Adelaide,\" said Reginald ; \"you see, I am using her Christian name already.\" Galbraith laughed. \" I haven't much knack of description, old fellow,\" he said, \" it will not be so very long before you see her for yourself. She is tall and fair, and has deep earnest blue eyes and a sweet face that I know you will hke. She and her sisters are very much alike. I little thought, when I went down to the quiet little town I am living in, that I was going there to fall in love and find a wife in it.\" \" Tell me about her,\" said Reginald, after a pause. \" Can you bear to hear much, dear old fel low ? \" answered Galbraith. \" I should never forgive myself if I excited you again. And I doubt whether I can bring myself to speak very calmly of her. When I think what her crime led to, and the long years that we have both suffered, and the way in which twelve years of your hfe have been, as it were, blotted out, do you wonder at it ? \""], [17, "UNDER. THE KINDLY MOON. 5 \" No ; but I can hear about her quite calmly,\" said Reginald, quietly. \" Ever since I came to myself and knew the old Squire again, and heard from him of you, and woke more and more every day to my new life, I have been preparing myself to hear of her. At first I thought she might be dead, and I reasoned with myself whether that would be well for me or ill ; then I pictured her as* hving somewhere where I should never hear of her or see her ; at other times I fancied that we might meet by chance, and then I *' scarcely dared to think of what might happen. When I had shaped all these things out in my mind in fifty different ways, I asked the old Squire about her just before he started for Europe. He told me that he should see you there ; told me that you considered me dead, and put new life in me by telling me that he should tell you of me, and that in due time you would come to me. I suppose that I was not quite right in his eyes just then. It needed the great joy of hearing of you and looking forward to seeing you to complete my cure. He said nothing of her. It was from you, dear old fellow, that I heard of the woman who wrecked my happiness and spoiled my"], [18, "6 TWO PARDONS. fife. How did you trace her to the quiet English town which you have described to me r \" Ah, Reggie,\" said Galbraith, \" that's a long story ; it took me some years on and off and here and there. I got the first clue by acci dent long after I believed you dead. Bit by bit and time after time I got scraps of informa tion, but it was not until I had left America, and after father's death, that I could settle down to anything like systematic and deter mined investigation. Then I went backward over the whole ground. The scraps I had heard before all related to her life in the States ; and when I had followed up that scent \u2014 with immense difficulty, of course, owing to the lapse of years and the space I had to cover \u2014 it suddenly branched off at a tangent and landed her in England.\" The speaker paused and smoked in silence for a minute. \" When I again struck the trail,\" he went on, \" I found to my great astonishment the evidences, not only of a change of scene, which was puzzling enough, but of a sudden and complete alteration of her mode of life. As you knew the worst of her years ago, an^"], [19, "UNDER THE KINDLY MOON. 7 before your illness, my poor fellow, you may guess, of course, that her life had been, after your supposed death from that duel, what it would be charitable to characterise as a Bohemian one. I am really using a mild con ventional word to describe the chequered existence she led for two years after that event.\" \" Aye, aye, my dear brother, I understand.\" \" From the moment of her landing in the old country,\" Galbraith went on, \" there was a complete change of front in the woman. She had thrown off the scoundrel with whom she went away.\" \" What became of that hound ? \" said Reginald, in a low voice. \" I should like to know.\" \" It was his name that gave me the first clue,\" said Galbraith. \" Have you ever met him ? \" said Reginald, leaning forward and laying his hand on his brother's arm. \" I have,\" said Galbraith. \" It was at Chagres, where Ralph D erring and I were knocking about one time. He had been down with Chagres fever at an hotel there, and the landlord, little thinking how much I was in-"], [20, "8 TWO PARDONS. terested in the matter, told us his story. She had left him suddenly, much as \" he stopped. \" As she did me, you would say, Harry,\" said Reginald Wilding, quietly ; \" go on, my dear old boy \u2014 I have told you that I can hear quite calmly anything you have to tell me about her. Say everything that has to be said ; I assure you you will not excite or injure me.\" \" Well, she left him, as she had left you,\" said Galbraith ; \"it appears that he had been seeking for her half over the South, having got some clue that she had been down there, and the disappointment at his want of success, and an attempt to swamp it out with some fine new Santa Cruz rum, had laid him on his back with Chagres fever, as I said.\" \" Did he recover ? \" \" Of the fever ? \" \" Yes.\" \" Oh, yes, he got well of the fever,\" said Galbraith, knocking the ash off the end of his cigar. \" Was anything else ailing him then ? \" asked Reginald. \" Yes, my dear fellow,\" said Galbraith, a"], [21, "UNDER THE KINDLY MOON. 9 little sternly, and with the clenching of the right hand which was the usual sign of his being under any strong feeling, \" there was. I waited until he was quite well, managed to confirm what the hotel-keeper had told me, and when I was thoroughly certain of my man, I told him one fine morning who and what was. \" There was a fight, of course,\" said Regi nald. \" There was a fight, of course,\" echoed his brother, \" and it was a perfectly square one. I left him at Chagres as I thought he had left you before at Baton Rouge \u2014 and he's there now.\" Again there was a period of silent smoking. \" The history of that event has led us into a httle digression from the main subject,\" said Galbraith, after a while. \" I was saying that from the time she landed in England a com plete change came over her life.\" \" How ? \" \" From a type of the United States female Bohemian she became almost at once, so far as I can trace, an embodiment of all the British female virtues. I schemed in twenty different ways to get at the people with whom she took"], [22, "10 TWO PARDONS. up on her arrival in England. After a great deal of trouble I succeeded. It was difficult, of course, to get the subject dragged into con versation without betraying the deep interest I had in the matter, but I managed it somehow. She began tu put her shoulder to the wheel and to earn her living quietly and respectably as soon as she touched English soil. She was a governess and companion in a very good family, when she attracted the notice of a wealthy merchant, who was a native of the town where I am now living, and he married her.\" \" That man was Stanhope, I suppose ? \" said Reginald Wilding. \" Under what name did she marry ? \" \" Under her proper name, Laura Constance Wilding ; under your name, that is.\" \" That does not look as though Walter Bryceson's theory of her having obtained a divorce were correct.\" \" No, it does not.\" \" A marriage under a wrong name would be invalid in England, would it not ? \" \" Undoubtedly, but this was not her wron<>' name. She never married the vagabond with whom she ran away, and, divorced or not"], [23, "UNDER THE KINDLY MOON. 11 divorced, Wilding was her proper name. So far she is on the right side.\" \" And she lives now at this quiet little town, Avonham, where you yourself are ? \" asked Reginald. \" Yes ; her husband was a native of the town, which is a pretty little place enough, with just enough fun going on at election time to make existence endurable to a forty - niner.\" \" And living, you say, as becomes her ? \" \" Living in all good report and conversation. Her husband died some four years ago, and she has, as yet, made no change in her position. She is the leader of what is called fashion in those parts, and entertains bishops. She is vastly rich, and I bought the house I live in from her. I have an idea in my head that there is an understanding between her and a young fellow who fives there, and who is the nephew of the member of parliament for the town, and, if report speaks truly, is likely to succeed him in his seat. I say that I have an idea of this, and it is an idea only, for I have no facts to go upon, but I have left behind me instructions that will put an effectual stop to that project if my notion should prove correct."], [24, "12 TWO PARDONS. That, then, is the way in which the whole matter stands at present, failing one thing.\" \" And that is ? \" \" That we do not know, and I have as yet been entirely unable to discover, whether she, after leaving you, obtained a divorce from you or not.\" \" Have w7e any means of ascertaining that ? \" asked Reginald. \" I propose to find it out from her own lips. That is to say, I shall, or rather \u2014 forgive me, old fellow \u2014 we will together throw the onus of proof on her, and if she claims to have obtained a divorce we will make her prove her state ment by documentary evidence from the court. \" And suppose,\" said Reginald Wilding, \" that she has never been divorced in the States ? \" \" Then,\" said Galbraith, slowly and deliber ately, \" in that case she is your wife still, and her future is in your hands.\" Reginald rose from his seat and leaned against the bulwark, watching the flashing sea ; after a while he said : \" Thank you, my dear Harry, for telling me all that you have to-night. It is very likely,"], [25, "UNDER THE KINDLY MOON. 13 now that I know7 all, that I shall not ask you any more about it, and I must think over what I have heard. It won't upset me, brother,\" he added wdth a smile, \" and it has done me good to have heard all to-night.\" \" Let us go into the saloon then, if you have finished your cigar,\" said Harry. And they left the deck. The passengers, the ladies especially, took a great interest in the close association of these two young men. They were not aware of the relationship existing between them, and considered them merely friends. It wras very touching, said the sentimental young ladies, to see how the younger of the two looked after the elder, who was only just recovering from a long and painful illness. And their interest was vastly increased by the fact that the self elected committee of management, which on every ocean-going ship regulates the morals and the relaxations of the passengers, had voted that the restored invalid was a \" d'cid'ly hahnsum mahn,\" and that the younger was \" a 'cute hand at the ship's games, and not a bad-lookin' fellah.\" Reginald Wilding was taller and darker than his half brother, and his pale, classical,"], [26, "14 TWO PARDONS. and delicately-cut face contrasted with the bronzed countenance and firm-set features of the other. In the lineaments of the elder there was the beauty of form wdiich is pleasing to the eye, but a judge of character would have had no hesitation in choosing which of the tw7o would better bear the buffets of the world. So the \"Scotia\" ploughed merrily and steadily across the deep, bearing her load of hopes and fears and sorrowrs and joys, and in quiet Marlshire the leader of Avonham's great ones smiled, and talked and walked among them like a queen, never dreaming that far away a mighty vessel was beating the wraves, and mocking the winds, and bringing Nemesis nearer and nearer to her w7ith every revolution of her paddle-wheels. For the patient, unwearying search of the injured brother had hunted her dow7n. She had sat unsuspectingly in Mr. Pollimoy's shop while the keen gaze of the stranger had rent the veil from her secret, and, before long, the grace of her presence, the lavish hospitality of her house, the devotion of her admirers, and the gratitude for her bounty, would all be unavailing in shielding the faithless w7ife, the degraded woman."], [27, "CHAPTER II. THE HARVESTING OF THE WHIRLWIND. Before the \" Scotia \" had put out from port freighted with so many important matters, a wrell-known face had disappeared from its accustomed place in Avonham. When Adolphus Carter left the room after his memorable interview with Bryceson and Markham, the former had remarked that he would come an awful cropper over the business. The picturesquely wrorded prophecy had come true not very long after Mr. Bompas's return from his visit to London. When that worthy man on the night of the riot had pleaded with Galbraith on behalf of his captive, it was well understood that regard for the father of the culprit had inspired his request for the forbearance of those who had him in their power. When the Reverend Mr. Carter had driven over with Mr. Millard and had interviewed Galbraith on behalf of his graceless son, the freedom wdth which Gal-"], [28, "16 TWO PARDONS. braith had forgiven the offence committed against him had prevented Mr. Bompas from taking any action with respect to his clerk be yond the bestowal on him of a carefully studied and elegantly rounded oration of the Georgian Era order, couched in the most swelling of periods and pregnant w7ith ponderous advice. Having done this, and being convinced that the young man's escapade was not a matter of public notoriety, and being, moreover, willing to give him a chance of recuperating his char acter, Mr. Bompas had allowed him to retain his position in his office, and had departed for London, trusting that the whole matter would only be remembered, as time went on, by Mr. Adolphus Carter himself, and that no one who was not actually in the secret of the night attack and the capture would be allowed to become acquainted with any of its details. In the settlement of this question, so gen erous had been the conduct of Galbraith, moved by Mr. Bompas's eloquent appeal and touched by the evident distress shown by the father, who came over to intercede for his son, that his frank and free forgiveness, delivered hi the brusque but not unkindly manner which was the peculiarity of his address to strangers, pre-"], [29, "THE HARVESTING OF THE W7H1RLWIND. 17 vented any very searching enquiries being put to the rioter as to the influences which had been at w7ork to induce him to act in so out rageous a manner, and he escaped being cross examined to any great extent from the fact that when Galbraith made an end of the matter by pardoning him, the two old friends who were concerned in bringing that result about had refrained from seeking for motives, and had been more industrious in endeavouring to discover excuses for his conduct. Mr. Bompas urged that probably the \" most unfortunate occurrence,\" in which terms he never ceased to describe the election, \" and the concomitant surroundings, had exercised a deleterious influence on a youth, hitherto fault less in moral conduct, and estimable in the discharge of the ordinary duties of his avocation in life.\" Mr. Millard said he must have been drunk. So Adolphus Carter escaped for that time. But the latter affair was more serious. In placing his trust on Shelman, and in relying upon his influence to screen him from the terrifying threats of Timothy Rapsey, Adolphus had leaned upon a rotten reed. No man in Avonham was less likely to protect a vol. in. 34"], [30, "18 TWO PARDONS. man at his own expense than Alfred Shelman. When Carter had brought him the news of Rapsey's vague threats, he had entered upon the matter of aggression with a sole view to OO the screening of his name and the protection of his own interests. When the joint scheme of attack had failed, and Carter's ungenerous ally found that a vigorous war was behig carried on against his territory, he was the first to turn savagely on his humbler and weaker associate, and to saddle him with his own sins and the punishment that might aw7ait them. He acted without any sense of shame hi the matter. The first time that he and Mr. Bompas met he broached the subject of his own accord, for Bompas w7as at heart a thorough gentleman , and his natural delicacy prevented him from touching upon a subject which, he was aware, would necessarily give pam to the other. But Shelman was not so reticent. In a violent manner and with many expletives he assailed Adolphus Carter, attributing the whole occurrence directly to his jealousy and wounded dignity. After this act of treachery towards his quondam ally, he proceeded to abuse Bryceson hi no measured terms. At this Mr. Bompas, who was as free from double deafino-"], [31, "THE HARVESTING OF THE WHIRLWIND. 19 as the other was accomplished in it, inter fered. \" Mr. Shelman,\" he said, \" I can listen to no language derogatory of a gentleman who is frequently my guest, who is frequently my host, whom I am glad to welcome into my house, and whose house I am glad to visit.

Bryceson ventured, in my presence, to employ towards you, in your absence, the language which you have applied towards him in his absence, I should administer the same \u2014 ah \u2014 reprimand to him as I have just administered to you.\" \" You talk pretty glibly about reprimand ing,\" said Shelman, his colour also rising. \" Pray who are you that you take such a liberty ? \" \" I am one,\" said Mr. Bompas, very firmly, and with a dignity that the stout-hearted old boy's handsome form and kindling face set off very w7ell, \" who will never \u2014 ah \u2014 hesitate to reprove any man, no matter what his position, w7ho dares to employ language hi my hearing concerning any friend of mine, which is not only indecently vituperative, but utterly un justifiable and positively untrue.\" This was positively the heaviest rhetorical shot that Mr. Bompas had ever fired in his fife, and its effect was immediately apparent on the person against whom it had been discharged. It was no ordinary Avonham gossip who was speaking. Shelman was not so blinded by his anger that he failed to appreciate the charac ter and influence of the man who w7as thus"], [33, "THE HARVESTING OF THE WHIRLWIND. 21 \" liberating his mind.\" He drew in his horns at once. \" I think,\" said he, after a minute's silence, \" it is a very hard thing that I, a native and a resident of this place, can get no sympathy over this affair from one of the most prominent citizens of the town, who yet is ready to take by the hand a man who hasn't been here any appreciable time, who drops from the clouds, who is not even living in his own house, and who may be, for all he knows, an adventurer.\" \" Mr. Shelman,\" said Mr. Bompas, \" I have made no comment on your encounter with Mr. Bryceson, beyond the very natural one that it was a most unfortunate and regrettable circum stance, but since you accuse me of\u2014 ah \u2014 undue partisanship, I feel constrained to tell you that, howrever much I deplore the method in which Mr. Bryceson \u2014 ah \u2014 acted, wdiatever happened w7as due entirely to your own \u2014 ah \u2014 im prudence, to call it by no harsher term, and that no peaceable citizen can sympathise with you on the return that you met for your law7 less attack on Mr. Galbraith's house and on other houses in the town.\" Mr. Shelman was puzzled how to answrer this."], [34, "22 TWO PARDONS. \"lam distressed beyond measure that that unhappy boy\" \u2014 so Mr. Bompas designated Adolphus Carter \u2014 \" had a share in the work, for, in face of recent events, it will be necessary for me to acquaint his father, who is an old friend of mine, that a removal of his son will be desirable.\" This was one stumbling-block out of Alfred Shelman's way, and he was glad to hear it. \" Well, Mr. Bompas,\" he said, \" I am sorry I get no more sympathy from you.\" \" I regret very much,\" said Mr. Bompas, \" that I have no more to extend to you.\" \" You will find,\" pursued Shelman, \" that you are excessively mistaken in Mr. Bryceson's character.\" \" I think not,\" said Mr. Bompas. \" You may be sure of one thing, I can see,\" said Shelman, who thought he saw a chance of wounding Mr. Bompas in his dignity, \" that Mr. Bryceson will not be long a visitor at your house and your host in the house of that precious friend of his, before he will be asking you for one of your daughters. I should ex tremely hke to see in what light you will look upon the fellow then !\" \" What you suggest,\" said Mr. Bompas with"], [35, "THE HARVESTING OF THE WHIRLWIND. 23 a smile, \" is not \u2014 ah\u2014 beyond the bounds of possibility, and since you are curious on the subject, I will \u2014 though I \u2014 ah \u2014 recognise no right that you have to make the inquiry \u2014 I will inform you how, in that case, I shall answer Mr. Bryceson. I shall \u2014 ah \u2014 thank him for the honour he is doing my family and my house, and shall \u2014 accede to his request with most especial gratification. I wish you a very good morning, Mr. Shelman.\" And Mr. Bompas, favouring the discom fited young man with a stiff bow7, left him to his thoughts. They were not pleasant ones. If Mr. Bompas had slammed the door of his house in Shelman's face, he could not have hinted more emphatically than he had by this conversa tion that he forbade him any familiar inter course with his family. Yet, beaten as he was at all points, one more blow was in store for him. A few days after this conversation Mrs. Stanhope issued her invitations for her last garden-party of the season, and did not in clude Alfred Shelman's name in her fist of expected guests. This did not surprise, although it irritated"], [36, "24 TWO PARDONS. him, but surprise and irritation were both lying in wait for him, and their attack was the more formidable because it was unexpected. \" Are you going to Mrs. Stanhope's fete? \" his uncle asked him the day before that event. \"No,\" said he rather surlily, and then, thinking it best to assume a careless, if not a don't-care air, he added, \" I'm not in the fair lady's good graces just now, and she hasn't done me the honour to invite me. I must endeavour to bear up against the disappoint ment as w7ell as I can.\" This conversation was taking place in the Bank parlour, where they were seated alone. Mr. Boldham sat tapping his blotting-pad with an ivory letter-opener for a minute or two after receiving this answer to his ques tion. Presently he broke silence. \" Why don't you take a couple or three months' run abroad somewhere ? \" he asked. Shelman looked up sharply from the paper on w7hich he wras writing. O \" Take a couple or three months' run abroad somewhere, did you say ? \" said he. \" Yes,\" replied his uncle, \" why don't you do it ? \""], [37, "THE HARVESTING OF THE WHIRLWIND. 25 \" Why on earth do you want me to go abroad at this time of the year ? \" asked Shelman. His uncle coughed drily. \" I fancy,\" he said, \" that you would find it greatly to your owrn interest to do so.\" \" What do you mean ? \" he said, ceasing his waiting and staring at his uncle. \" I think that, if I w7ere you, I should get away from the town for a little time and let things blow over,\" said Boldham. \" Do you ? \" \" Yes,\" said his uncle, \" I do. You look at the matter in the right light, Alfred, and you will see that my advice is good.\" \" I shall be glad,\" said Shelman after a pause, \" if you can show me how.\" \" I should fancy,\" said Mr. Boldham, \" that you must find thhigs in Avonham rather un pleasant just now.\" \" They are not very cheerful, I admit,\" answered Shelman, \" but I will go my own way about them.\" \" Well,\" said Mr. Boldham, \" I think, if you do, you will be very foolish.\" \" Pray,\" said Shelman, with a frown, \" will you show me why you think so ? \""], [38, "TWO PARDONS. 26 \" I am going to endeavour to do so,\" said O O ' Mr. Boldham, \" indeed it is necessary for my interests as well as for your own that I should ; I will thank you, not only as my nephew7 but as my partner, to give me your best atten tion.\" Shelman laid dowm his pen and threw him self back in his chair. He stared at Mr. Bold ham in some surprise.

If old Mas'r KiUett allowed his memory to stray as far back ward on the path of hfe as it could go, it is likely that he would find that the most vivid of all his earliest recollections were the facts that Saturday night was \" tub night,\" and that he wore his best clothes on the following day. Since his early days indeed there had been one great change ; when he was young all flocked to the parish church, and such dissenters as existed in those times were a feeble folk who preached in holes and corners, and were greatly despised and hated, except where they w7ere pitied as lunatics. Now, though St. Hildegarde's was the finest, it was not the only place of worship in Avonham. Three chapels of as many different sects attracted congregations of their own, and though in so old-fashioned a town the church held the pride of place, the"], [53, "A BOMBSHELL IN MR. BOMPAS'S PEW. 41 chapel folk, under w7hich title all classes of dissent were grouped by the orthodox, were a power in the place. However, the adherents to the Church of England plumed themselves when they considered that the old Abbey held on Sunday the most prominent and wealthy of the commonwealth of the town. The church itself was a noble one. In its crypt antiquarians gravely passed their hands over the surface of the mouldings of three or four arches, and murmured with gratification, \" Hatchet-work \u2014 Saxon ; \" the remainder of the crypt arches were Norman, and early Norman too \u2014 in the nave there wras never cavilling at the genuineness and beauty of the Norman work ; there was good Transitional work in the choir ; the west door was the pride of the country round, and the workman ship of the whole was so solid that the hand of that Goth of Goths, the Gothic \"restorer,\" had found no occasion for disfiguring the whole pile by utilitarian windows or nondescript strengthenings ; and generation after genera tion of churchwardens had eschewed w7hitewash.

So that the church of St. Hildegarde remained, as its pious builders had intended it, a grand monument of men of whom it has been said : \" They dreamed not of a perishable home Vv7ho thus could build.\" Let me pause in my tale for a moment solemnly to call down the curse of Ernulphus upon the whole tribe of ignorant church de facers who, under the title of \" restorers,\" haA'e done their best, are doing their best, and Avill do their best to mutilate, destroy, and nun the noble shrines of our common faith all OA7er this land, so rich in them, and so proud of them.

Mas'r Killett had played the fiddle \u2014 \"For French of Paris was to him unknown,\" and he would haA7e rejected the word violin \u2014 in the choir in his youth, and was years before he could be reconciled to the change ; but the feeling died out as one by one his fellow musicians died off ; and he could hsten, with gratification now, to the tones of the instrument which Reuben Matley handled with exquisite skiU. For the congregation, it was appreciative, easily pleased, and liked its religion soothing. Its elders w7ere gifted in slumber, its youth decorous in behaAriour. It had its signs and portents, and the amatory contemporary his tory of its members might be easily read by the experienced. If a young member of the male sex were observed to be gazing intently at a fan worshipper during the singing or the"], [56, "TWO PARDONS. 44 reading of the Psalms (he couldn't see her at lesson or sermon times, the pew7s were too high), the congregation knew that his hitherto private admiration was now publicly declared. If at a subsequent service the maiden bashfully returned the gaze, it was taken as a token that she had been informed of the homage paid to her and approved of the same.

The office, wdiich he filled with all the zeal and integrity that marked the whole of the transactions of this w7orthy man, was in his eyes a vastly honour able one, and the churchwarden's pew which he occupied with his family was the most comfortable in the church, and admirably suited for that calm meditation and profound repose of mind w7hich should distinguish a churchwarden. Mr. Bompas always reposed \u2014 his mind \u2014 from the middle ofthe sermon to the benediction. It was a fine NoA'ember morning about a fortnight after the party.

His quondam rival, Mr. Boldham, was in a pew not far from him ; he was in one corner, and Alfred Shelman in another. It was not often that the latter was seen in St. Hildegarde's ; he was not A'ery constant in his Sunday duties, but on this particular day he had decided to be present ; pubhc scandal was dying out about him now, and there was a kind of policy in his presence. He voted the thing a bore, but it was judicious to undergo the fatigue, and he Avas here, httle thinking, as people remarked afterwards, that it was the last time he would see the inside of St. Hildegarde's. Mrs. Stanhope was absent, and her pew empty. That Sunday morning had its results for her also, though she little dreamed of them. The bell ceased its summons, Mr. Reuben Matley played a voluntary, the clergy took"], [59, "A BOMBSHELL IN MR, BOMPAS'S PEW. 47 their places, and the service began. There were one or two persons in that church who would remember that service all their lives long. It opened uneventfully enough. The latest engaged young lady came in late in the middle of the Venite, followed by her blushing swain carrying her books, and internally execrating the whole affair ; the Psalms were duly got through ; the inevitable boy dropped the customary marble in the middle of the first lesson, and was poked by the beadle ; the con gregation sang the Te Deum lustily (Jackson in F), and the younger of the two curates read the second lesson. Part of that lesson was the story of the woman taken in adultery, and how she was not condemned. It was a peculiar fancy of the good old Adcar to read the banns of marriage himself. This custom was well understood in Avonham, and the slight pause between the completion ofthe lesson and the vicar's walking to the reading desk from his seat at the communion table, which would have appeared to a stranger like a hitch in the service, w7as familiar to the con gregation. The reading of the banns was always interesting.

Adelaide had inherited her bravery. Her father, pompous and stilted as he was, had Nelson's knowledge of fear \u2014 which was just none at all \u2014 and plenty of decision and action. The news really was a blow to him, but the sight of his daughter doing her duty roused him to action, in which no man could be more prompt or swift. He rang the bell, drank a glass of wine to steady himself, and said to the servant, as though he wrere giving the most ordinary order : \" Jane, tell Watts to put the brown mare in the dog-cart at once ; it must be at the door in ten minutes.\" Jane stared. Such an order had not been given in Mr. Bompas's house since she had been in it. She wras too well trained, howeA7er, to hesitate, and withdrew. All Avonham was destined to be surprised that day apparently ; certainly Watts, wrho had been in his present"], [69, "A MAID OF THE AVEST SAXONS. 57 post for twenty-five years, was when he received the order. \" Drat the fussy wrench ! \" he said, putting down \" Zadkiel's Almanac,\" w7hich he was reading in the harness-room \u2014 Watts preferred that place to St. Hildegarde's on Sunday mornings \u2014 \" what do 'ee mean ? Don't 'ee play none o' yer kitchen oonderments on me, s'naa. Master be to church.\" \" HeVe a corned home, tell 'ee,\" said Jane, \" an' the dog-cart's got to be at the door in ten minutes. What's the use o' flyin' at I ? Goo'n ask him yerself ! \" and she slammed the harness -room door hard and brought down the bin-dust on the harness \u2014 winch always pleases a groom. \" Dal the young hussy ! \" said Watts, tak ing down the harness howrever ; \" whate\\7er new game's this to play of a Sunday in church time ! Happen someone's ill, and master sent for thoo.\" And muttering and grumbling, he proceeded to harness the mare, and had the dog-cart round in the prescribed time. He wras some what disappointed too to find that it was wanted, and that he was not the victim of a hoax. He went to the kitchen, made the"], [70, "TAVO PARDONS. 58 amende honorable to Jane and got a mug of beer, over which he gossiped with the maids, and made eleven guesses at the errand of his master and young mistress, discussion on which subject was carried on until the cook's mind got confused with gossip and graA7y combined, and she cleared the kitchen. The various congregations were streaming homewards when Mr. Bompas and Adelaide drove back from AA7onham Road, but the mind of the churchwarden was too much taken up by his daughter's communication to notice the looks of wonder that greeted them along the street. Adelaide had told him all, and he had emphatically declared that, after that, he w7as neA'er going to be surprised again. Ade laide sat defiant of all the glances. She had need of firmness now, she said to herself, and if people were talking about her to-day, as she wras perfectly well aware they were, they would soon have such a theme as AA'onham had neA'er enjoyed, and a scandal with a A'engeance. Arrived at home she ran upstairs to her own room, avoiding the drawing-room, where she heard the voices of her mother and sisters. Mr. Bompas entered the latter apartment. \" Mercy on us, Abel ! \" said Mrs. Bompas,"], [71, "A MAID OF THE WEST SAXONS. 59 as her lord and master came in ; \" whatever is afoot ? what made Addie rush out of church hke that, and where have you been ? \" \" My dears,\" said Mr. Bompas to his family, uplifting a deprecatory hand, \" Adelaide has just told me the most astounding piece of news I haA7e ever heard. It is a matter con fided to her by Mr. Galbraith, and one that she has been bound to keep from us aU till now, when she has told me. Louisa, my dear, your sister has sent an urgent message to Mr. Bryceson, and he will doubtless be here with all speed ; he is also concerned in the matter. My dear,\" he gravely concluded, addressing his wife, \" I haA'e never had a secret from you, nor shall this be one ; but at present the matter is one of such extraordinary moment, and deals with such \\7ast interests, that until Mr. Bryceson arrives we will, if you please, ha\\7e no discussion about it ; and re member, girls, you are not to question Ade laide. The matter concerns us only indirectly, and you will know all in due time.\" So Adelaide was not asked any questions, and the dinner being announced and served, wras eaten, though it was a very quiet meal."], [72, "60 TWO PARDONS. \" My dear Laura \u2014 you see I am taking the uncle's privilege already,\" \u2014 laughed Sir Head ingly Cairn the next afternoon, \" you mustn't be angry with Walter, or I shall be vexed with myself for having told you. I remember v7ery w7ell speaking to him on that A'ery sub ject \u2014 ah \u2014 some time ago, and he assured me that beyond paying the natural tribute of admiration to the young lady's good looks \u2014 as one w7ould admire a picture, you know \u2014 he had neA'er thought in any serious way of Miss Bompas.\" \" So that it is a case of wounded \\7anity, and not of blighted affections, Sir Headingly ? Well, I'll promise you that Walter shan't be scolded. I am just going to call on Mr. Bompas ; will you give me your arm so far ? How soon it gets dark now ! We shall have Christmas on us before we dream of it.\" Sir Headingly had been regaling Mrs. Stan hope with an account of the surprise with which the publication of the banns had been received, and had informed her of the abrupt departure of Adelaide from the church. In common with many people, he had assigned a reason for this, v7ery wide of the truth. Pride in his nephew, belief in his powers of fascina-"], [73, "A MAID OF THE WEST SAXONS. 61 tion, and a remembrance of some idle tales that he had once heard coupling Walter Rivers's name with Adelaide Bompas's, had led him to imagine that the announcement of Walter's intended marriage had shattered some illusions and given the girl a shock, the force of winch she had been injudicious enough to confess to the world by her action of the day before. This opinion he had con fided to Mrs. Stanhope, after an inteniew7 with his nephew7, w7ho, strangely enough, so he thought, did not enter into his feehngs, but A'ehementlv combated the idea he had formed. Sir Headingly had laughingly put aside the question, but had diplomatically determined that he would smooth the way for his nephew7 by being himself Mrs. Stanhope's informant. He was delighted with his success. Pre-mat rimonial quarrels, the old bachelor knew7, w7ere often very awkward things to adjust ; when the couple were made fast in wedlock, they might squabble as much as they chose with out any of his interference, but things had better be kept agreeable until then. It was the simple philosophy of a man who had never himself ventured into the arena, but who had observed from a safe height many"], [74, "TAVO PARDONS. 62 connubial battles and lovers' wars, and, if we are to beheve that lookers-on see most of the battle, then we must venerate the judgment of this old spectator. Sir Headingly left Mrs. Stanhope at Mr. Bompas's door, and took a courtly leave of her. It was very rarely that Mrs. Stanhope A'isited her agent in South Street. She was received at the door by Jane, with respect akin to veneration, and was ushered into the drawing-room. Mrs. Stanhope looked round the apartment with some interest. It was as handsome in its proportions, she obser\\7ed, as any in her own house ; and eA7eryw7here were eAidences of tastes more artistic, and accomplishments more varied, than she had expected to find in any family of the town. She gave up a few minutes to a careful suney of her surround ings, and w7as disagreeably impressed with the fact that they gave unmistakable tokens of taste and education, as w7ell as of wealth. Taste as correct as her own too. There were one or two pieces of music on the open piano ; she took them up and examined them \u2014 Chopin, Schumann, Gluck ; she put them"], [75, "A MAID OF THE WEST SAXONS. 63 down. She read the titles of some of the books on the centre table \u2014 Ruskin (this is not a tale of the present year), Tennyson, Keble, Carlyle, Emerson, Lyell. She looked around at the pictures ; she was not a bad judge. EA7eryone was a water colour, and at that time the \" lot \" wrould have \" fetched \" eight hundred pounds ; now-a-days, fifteen hundred. She resumed her seat, and, for the first time since her husband's death had made her the leader of AA7onham, forgot that she had been kept waiting more that ten minutes. Oh foohsh woman, consider ; were you ever kept waiting ten minutes before ? Is the sign nothing to you ? Away, away, fly and hide yourself, for evil is coming on you ! No, the delay is nothing ; the sign is hidden ; she waits quietly and unsuspect ingly in the drawing-room of her house and estate agent, and thinks of no evil, only waits for the door to open.

Adelaide was close to the door, and on being spoken to by Jane entered. Mr. Bompas bowed to Mrs. Stanhope again, and went out"], [79, "A MAID OF THE WEST SAXONS. 67 of the room. Adelaide closed the door care fully, and advanced towards the chair in which Mrs. Stanhope w7as seated. The two women looked very firmly at each other. Mrs. Stanhope had not intended that it should be so. She had meant to kill Miss Bompas's presumptuous mind with a stern gaze, to trample on it with a few stinging sentences, and, haA'ing received a tearful sub mission, to magnanimously forgh'e her her audacity in daring to loA7e. But she w7as met by a look as proud and high as her ow7n ; and a thought flashed across her, that w7hereas she had hitherto looked upon Adelaide as a merely pretty girl, she was in reahty a beautiful one ; as stately and commanding as herself, and, she added mentally as she took a second glance at the stern look and the set face, as strong and as insensible to fear. \" You wished to see me, Mrs. Stanhope ? \" said Adelaide. \" Yes, Adelaide,\" said Mrs. Stanhope ; \" I heard that you were ill in church yesterday, and as I was calling on your father on business I thought I should hke to know how you are to-day.\" \" I was not ill in church yesterday, Mrs. 37\u20142"], [80, "68 TAVO PARDONS. Stanhope,\" said Adelaide, \" and I am quite w7ell to-day. But it is very kind of you to take so much interest in me as to enquire.\" Mrs. Stanhope laughed. \" When young ladies leave church in a A'iolent hurry,\" she said, \" neighbours naturally imagine that they are ill ; or,\" she added, \"that they have some other cause for their departure.\" Adelaide laughed in her turn. \" Yours is a beautiful system of generalisa tion,\" said she ; \" it takes A'ery httle wit and A7ery httle wisdom to divide mankind into two parts ; for instance, your two branches of young ladies, wdio leaA'e church because they are ill, and young ladies who leaA'e for some other cause, would include aU young ladies who go to church. In which of the two classes does it please you to place me ? \" Now this speech was decidedly flippant, yet Mrs. Stanhope, although in a great rage at it, had sense enough not to show7 temper. The tone of the girl showed that there w7as some thing behind her w7ords. \" My dear Miss Bompas,\" said she \u2014 she dropped the familiar \" Adelaide,\" which the other did not fail to notice \u2014 \" do you know"], [81, "A MAID OF THE AVEST SAXONS. 69 what people are saying about your conduct yesterday ? \" \" You mean people in Avonham, of course, Mrs. Stanhope ? \" said Adelaide calmly. \" Yes, people in Avonham,\" said Mrs. Stanhope, rather sharply ; \" and with Sir Headingly Cann at the head of them.\" Now7 Mrs. Stanhope had no right to bring the affable Baronet into the com7ersation at all, and she soon regretted that she had done so. \" Poor dear Sir Headingly ! \" said Adelaide, actually laughing at that revered man's name ; \" he's always on the wrong track. Yes, Mrs. Stanhope, I can tell you what people in Avon ham are saying of me because I left church hurriedly yesterday. I will not allow you the gratification of informing me.

She shrank, and Adelaide felt that she trembled as though in an ague fit. Then she pressed one hand OA'er her eyes as if she shut out some horrid sight. In a minute her whole manner changed. The stroke had reached her brain. She tore herself from Adelaide's clasp and flung one arm back, as seeking for some thing ; at last her hand reached a chair, which she grasped and held, warning Adelaide aw7ay"], [85, "A MAID OF THE WEST SAXONS. 73 with the other hand. It was a sight to aw7e any but the stoutest heart, but the brave girl neA7er flinched. Not a moA7ement escaped Adelaide's eye, not a sign of fear did she show as the woman raA7ed. \"Wilding ! ha, ha ! A fool ! a fool ! Francois shot him ! Don't bullets kill fools then ?

Walter, we will ride them down and live them down, and you shall God haAre mercy on me ! \" Adelaide laid her on the sofa, and restrained the struggling hands ; then she rang the bell. When Mrs. Stanhope had been restored she was calm. The first effects of the blow7 having passed away, she became again the haughty proud woman she had alw7ays been. She looked keenly at Adelaide's face as if to see"], [86, "74 TAVO PARDONS. whether she had betrayed her secret, but there were no signs there. Mrs. Bompas was lost in wonder, and voluble in sympathetic phrases ; if she had been silent and embarrassed, there would have been danger. Mrs. Stanhope felt that she had still time left for thought and action. She drank some wine, and would have sent for one of her servants but that Mr. Bompas insisted on being allow7ed to see her safely to the Priory House. She would walk, she told Mrs. Bompas, it would do her good ; she had not had one of these attacks for years, and could not account for this one. So, resist ing all offers of being driven home, she left with Mr. Bompas, ghing Adelaide a parting glance, half-terrified, half-defiant, as she went out of the door. They walked to the end of South Street, and were about to cross the market-place, when the din and murmur of a crowd broke on their ears. A body of men, folio w7ed by shouting boys and excited women, w7ere bearing some thing on a rough stretcher formed of two hurdles lashed together.

Mrs. Stanhope broke from his arm with a Avild cry and rushed forw7ard. The bearers stopped as she did so. \" Who is it ? \" she cried ; \" whose name did you say ? Let me pass ! \" Her own coachman stood before her, and by the pale light of the lanterns carried by some of the men, she could see that his face was white, and that the tears were streaming down his cheeks. \" For the loA'e o' God, my dear lady,\" said he, gently restraining her, \" don't 'ee look ; it b'ain't no sight for 'ee, my poor dear soul.

The bloodless, wraxen face, with the hair hanging about the forehead, and wet and foul with the water and weed of AA'on, was yet beautiful in death. The face of Walter Rivers. She gave no cry as she rose to her feet. Only those who caught her hi their strong arms as she fell thought they heard her Avhisper something. They did not know7 what words she spoke ; they wrere the words of Cain \u2014 \" My punishment is greater than I can bear ! \" Such of her own people as w7ere there took her away, and the dead body was borne off.

Besides that, they had the opportunity of accompanying the jury as they walked down the length of the town to Sir Headingly Cann's house to Aiew7 the body, and also the privilege of marching back with them. The jury was composed of fourteen of the worthiest burgesses of Avonham. The Mayor, Mr. Sennett, was entrusted with the task of watching the case for Alfred Shehnan, who was in the room in custody. Many acquaint ances of ours were members \u2014 Raraty, Chickle holt, Follwell, the brothers Pye, Polhmoy, Timothy Rapsey (w7ho had specially entreated the inspector of pohce to select him), Killett, and six others with whom our tale has had nothing to do. Mr. Bompas was present, but was a spectator only, and to judge by bis face a deeply grieA7ed one. By his side was Fred Markham, who with Bryceson had returned to Avonham the night before. When the coroner bade the jury choose their foreman, there was a pause ; if Timothy Rapsey had been elected he would have died happy, but no mention was made of his name. At last ex- Mayor"], [92, "80 TAVO PARDONS. Killett said, \" Mr. Follwell's the agedest of us \u2014Mr. Follwell, will you act, sir ? \" and, Mr. Folhvell consenting, the others said, \" Ah, yes, Mr. FohVell, do you act, sir,\" and the thing w7as done. Mr. Follwell and his brother jurymen were duly sworn, and the enquiry opened. The coroner briefly remarked that they had assembled there on an enquiry of more than usual importance, and one of the most painful nature. He then called the first witness, Sir Headingly Cann. It did not need a second look at the old Baronet's face to learn the terrible grief that had overtaken him. He had steeled himself, how7eA7er, and controlled his sorrow7 to give evidence. He identified the body as that of his nepheAv, Walter Cann Rivers, aged twenty-six. He last saw7 the deceased alive at lunch on the preceding day ; he w7as then in his usual health ; he next saw him when lis dead body was brought home. He knew of no enmity existing between the deceased and any other person likely to have led to the minder. Shelman stood up here, and in a firm voice said, \" Sir Headingly, your nephew7 and I had"], [93, "CROAVNER'S QUEST LAAV. 81 quarrelled, but, before God, I swrear that I never killed him ! \" The coroner begged him to be silent. He was represented, and had better trust himself to his legal adviser. Any statement he made might be used against him. o o The next witness was a labouring man named Jacob Starer, who was much impressed by the surroundings, and called the coroner \" my lord.\" His story was extracted from him with some difficulty, owing to his con fusion, but finally turned out to be this : He was returning from work, and was making for a footbridge across the river, OA7er which he had to pass to get to his home ; about five minutes before he reached this, the time being about three o'clock, he heard two shots fired in quick succession. He thought it curious that they came from the banks of the stream, as the afternoon was misty and it was foggy near the river, but concluded that someone was after water-rats. A few yards before he reached the bridge his foot struck something, which proved to be a hat.

Some persons came from a neighbouring mill, and having helped him to take the body indoors, sent for the police. He thought deceased was quite dead when he found him. So much from Jacob, got Avith vast trouble, but evidently true. The next witness wras a more important one. He w7as assistant to a grocer in Avon ham, and was named Lightfoot. He stated that on the preceding afternoon he was out collecting accounts for his master, and had to call at the mill. On the bridge OA7er wdlich he crossed w7ere the deceased and Mr. Shelman ; they were quarrelling violently. Mr. Shelman had a double-barrelled gun with him. It was not in his hand, but leaning against the rail ing of the bridge.

He gaAre his evidence clearly enough, but with evident distaste for the task. Mr. Rivers had replied, he said farther, \" Haven't you had enough of fighting lately ? \" Mr. Shelman at that flew into a great rage, and he thought w7ould have struck Mr. Rivers if he (witness) had not come up. He spoke to the gentlemen ; he said, \" Dear me, gentle men ! \" He knew them both. Mr. Rivers laughed at him, but Mr. Shelman told him to go (somewhere) and mind his own business. Mr. Rh7ers then said, \" See what an exhibi tion you are making of yourself ; the fellow is quite right to speak, and you are a fool with all your threats and bluster ! \" Mr. Shelman had flown into a violent passion, and had threatened to kick witness if he did not go on. Being afraid to meddle with anyone of Mr. Shelman's standing, he left them and went on to the mill. Before he got there he heard twro shots. They came from the direction of the bridge. The afternoon was rather foggy, and it was thick near the river ; you could only see a few yards ahead, say twenty \u2014 about a cricket-pitch \u2014 38\u20142"], [96, "84 TWO PARDONS. but he could tell from the sound. When he had been to the mill, and the miller's wife had paid him her bill for a month's groceries, he was coming away, when he heard shouting. He and one of the mill-hands ran to the bridge, and found the last witness holding the deceased. The gun produced w7as the one he saw on the bridge ; he knew7 it to be Mr. Shelman's ; he had once brought it from Avonham Road, at the request of Mr. Shel man. Next a policeman proA'ed finding the gun in the bed of the rher close to the scene of the murder ; he had recoA7ered it that morning ; it was at the bottom of the river in the centre of the stream, which there was shallow, and he could see it from the bank. Then the doctor described the state of the body and the fatal wounds. Death must have ensued directly, and was caused by the shots, not by drowning.

There were no harsh words or strong expressions used by the crowd, and there was almost complete silence w7hen the carriage, drh7en by a police officer, set out ; but when the townsfolk had watched it out of sight there broke out on every hand murmurs of pity for the \\ictim of the crime ; wrords of sincere condol ence with the lady w7ho was to have been his wife, and who w7as, as her senants reported, stricken dowm by uncontrollable grief, and fierce execrations against Shelman."], [99, "CROWNER'S QUEST LAW. 87 In all that town, where he had been so powerful and so masterful ; among all those people who six months ago would have been proud to have a word thrown to them in the market-place, there was scarce one to stand for ward and say one good thing for him.

Then he leaned back in his seat and sighed heaAily. He was not the only old inhabitant of Avon ham who felt keenly the disgrace that had so suddenly come on the place. The murder w7hich had roused such a sense of horror and indignation in the quiet Marlshire town had been committed on the afternoon of Monday ; the inquest, from the fact of the coroner for North Marlshire residing just out side AA7onham and thus bemg close at hand, had been held on the foUowing day, Tuesday ; it was now Friday, but only a \" httle market day,\" and the funeral was fixed for the morrow7. From the time that the body of Walter Rivers had been brought into the towm until now, the place had worn a sombre and funereal aspect. With the great bulk of people the unfortunate victim had been extremely popular. EspeciaUy during the last two or three years he had laid himself out to be pleasing and weU thought of ; and that he had succeeded was fully shown now : on aU sides nothing but good was said of this dead man. To-morrow there Avould be such a concourse at the funeral as the town"], [102, "TWO PARDONS. 90 had never seen, for there was more than or dinary attraction ; in addition to the sorrow and respect which would have been shown if the young man had died the ordinary death of men, there were the surroundings, which would draw the spectators into the region of the horrible. Meanw7hile the wiser heads of the town grie\\7ed themselves sorely over the scandal that had befaUen it, and Master Kil lett's desponding words found an echo in many hearts. The cronies had not met for twro or three nights, but gregariousness is strong, and they had come together again, naturally and because the doings of the morrow must be debated with all solemnity, also because it w7as not natural for them to be separated at a time when the air was full of events and the very walls had rumours in them. So they w7ere sitting to night, not hi the Club room, for it was not Club night, but, much as they were wont to sit on ordinary nights, in the smoking room. One or two farmers from the neighbourhood were there, in addition to the usual townsfathers ; they had an excellent excuse ready for such of their wives as had not themselves come in to learn all the news. A good many had, and"], [103, "\"THE AVONHAM MURDER.\" 91 Mrs. Pinniffer's teapots and toasting forks had had a busy time of it. Every man who came in did so with a sub dued and gloomy air ; the customary greetings Avere given sotto voce ; no mention was made of the weather or the land ; the price of beasts was ignored, and yet no one approached the subject which every one had at heart. Some one was wanted to fire the train, and the Nestor of AA'onham did it. Reuben Matley took the paper handed to him by the old man, and, himself, shook his head sympatheticaUy. It may be noticed here that there were some absentees. Notwithstanding that the \" Bear \" was very often the settling-place for him and his chents on market day, Mr. Bompas was not present to-day. Mr. Sennett, as everyone knew, was in London, and all knew the busi ness that took him there. Raraty would send to meet him to the last train calling at Avon ham Road that light. Doctor Mompesson, who often smoked a pipe there after market day, was also absent. It was understood that the state of Mrs. Stanhope gave him much anxiety, and that he had almost taken up his abode at the Priory House. All Avonham was filled"], [104, "92 TAVO PARDONS. with sympathy for his patient, and those of her household who came out into the town were eagerly questioned as to her progress. Mr. Timothy Rapsey w7as in his element, but not at his ease. There was one point on which he was troubled, and that one point was enough to cause him some mental discomfort. He feared that his revelations respecting the riot had reached Rhers's ears and had led to the quarrel between the young men. However, public opinion had not pointed that wray, and he was somewhat relieved. He took up Mas'r Killett's parable as the latter put away his paper. \" 'Tis a great disgrace to us all, for sure,\" said he ; \" Mr. Matley, read us out a bit of it ; wrhat do the London folk think about it ? Do they think there's any cause for it ? What do they say w7as the reason of 't ? Be they goin' to have it tried at Ridgetown, or be they goin' to take it up to London ? Lor' ! I'll go if they do ; that I will ! \" \" What need for 'em to take it up to London, Timothy ? \" said Killett the younger, and his voice had a shade of aggressiveness in it ; \" 'tain't come to such a pass yet but wdiat a Marlshire jury can try a Marlshire murder, I do hope ! \""], [105, "\"THE AVONHAM MURDER.\" 93 \" There have been cases where it has been done, Killett,\" said Timothy, \" on account of prejudice, you know.\" \"What do 'ee mean by prejudice now, Timothy ? \" said KiUett ; \" agenst the pri soner r \" Yes, I do ; I've read o' cases w7here it haA'e been said as a man couldn't get a fair trial in 's own county, and theyVe took it into another.

This was a weU-known sign in Avonham, and be tokened, even in Timothy, the possession of information pecuharly valuable, or the intention of delivering something unusually weighty or oracular. So, when the assembled party saw"], [106, "TAVO PARDONS. 94 this portent, they preserved decorous and at tentive silence and listened eagerly. No one thought very much of Timothy's opinions, but there was no doubt as to his abihty and in dustry in collecting facts and rumours. \" I remember,\" he said, \" ah, just so weU as if it were yesterday, in this very room, just when the election doin's first come up, being took A'ery much to task for that A'ery thing.

Timothy Rapsey, in his eagerness for infor mation, quite forgot old Mas'r KiUett's cross ness, and almost the topic on which he had been speaking. \" Lor' ! \" he said, \" comin' home to-morrow, is he ? if it's a fan question, who told 'ee, Mr. Raraty ? \""], [108, "96 TWO PARDONS. \" Mr. Bryceson,\" answered Christopher ; \" I've got to send a carriage to meet him and a cart for his big luggage.\" \" Comin' home to-morrow, is he ? \" said Rapsey again ; \" he's been away a power of a time, hasn't he ?

Perhaps even Mrs. Pinniffer felt so too, and would not have made any reply ; indeed a storm might have been averted from Timothy Rapsey's head but for the presence in the smoking room of an inquisitive farmer to w7hom this conversation was all Greek. This man lured the httle chatterbox to his fate by the simplest and most natural question possible."], [111, "\" THE AVONHAM MURDER.\" 99 \" An' what were that, Mr. Rapsey ? \" said he cheerily and loudly, and felt that he had done society a sendee. Timothy rushed on his fate by degrees. \" What's the cause o' half the quarrels in the world ? \" he said, with a grin. \" WeU,\" said the farmer, still cheerily, and looking round for approbation, \" 'tis a woman, nine times out o' ten they do say ! Ha ! ha ! ha ! \" So old and crusted a joke demanded his own laughter, but he was unaccompanied. \" Yes,\" said Timothy, \" you're right, and that was so in this case. Both in love with the same woman.\" Pinniffer looked somewhat anxiously at his wife. That good lady had friends at the Priory House, and was a known partisan of that man sion ; but this time she was sdent. She gave a spiteful glance at Timothy, and her tongue was very close to her hps, but she did not speak. It was not at her hands that Timothy was to receive his reproof. John Rann had been fidgeting about in his chair for the last few minutes, evidently with something on his mind, and he now broke forth. \" What a mischievous, mischief-making man you are, Rapsey ! \" he said in a tone of great 39\u20142"], [112, "100 TWO PARDONS. wrath. \"Drat it aU, ye might leaA7e the poor woman alone in her trouble for a bit, mightn't ye ?

If you come to fault-finding, and want to lay faults on people's shoulders, I'U join ye. You've had your say, Timothy Rapsey, and now I'll have mine. I'll teU ye one or two things as '11 perhaps astonish ye. First and foremost,\" said the sturdy httle par tisan, bringing down his hand on the table with a slap that made Timothy jump, \" I don't belieA'e, and I ivon't beheve till he confesses it, that Mr. Shehnan did the murder at all \" To say that the company stared would be to use a feeble word, and one entirely useless for describing the expression of features that every one in the room put on. \" and secondly, I'll say to your face, Timothy Rapsey \u2014 and I don't make no bones about it neither \u2014 that, wdiether Mr. Shelman"], [113, "\"THE AVONHAM MURDER.\" 101 did it or not, it was as much your fault as any one's ! \" Whack ! came Mr. John Rann's hand down again on the table, and he stared triumphantly round on the most astounded set of faces he had ever seen. It is a mercy that Wolstenholme Pye did not suggest that the company should put into effect the wild notion which flew through his astonished brain, of hanging Timothy Rapsey at once and without any trial but a Lydford one \u2014 which had its advantages, although crim inals were prejudiced against it \u2014 for if he had formulated his idea, he would, most certainly, have been backed up by his brother, and the execution once moA7ed and seconded, it is a matter of considerable question whether pubhc feeling at that moment would not have been strong enough to have ensured its being carried out. Pinniffer's military instincts might have induced him to suggest a drum -head court martial, but it is doubtful. Fortunately, Wolstenholme Pye, whatever his ideas were, was too much paralysed to enunciate them, and the moment passed. But the shock on the assembled cronies was a great one. Old Mas'r KUlett couldn't jump"], [114, "102 TWO PARDONS. as w7ell as he used to, but he jumped a good deal ; Barnabas Chickleholt, who was given to breaking pipes in moments of excitement, ac complished a \" best on record,\" and smashed his chmchwarden into more pieces than he could haA7e counted ; ex -Mayor KiUett, who would not have gone out of his way to harm a hornet, kicked the cat half-way across the room \u2014 spasmodically, of course. Beadlemore Arto poured the whole of his gin-and-water over his legs, and Pinniffer rang the bell sharply, without the least occasion. The rest of the company were affected in dh'ers ways, and Timothy Rapsey's face could not have turned more ashy- white if he had known of Wolstenholme Pye's wild thought and feared immediate action on it. The first one in the room to recover was the cat. That sagacious beast went out and sat in the bar. Then the nobler animals graduaUy came to. There is no portrait extant which represents the Emperor Napoleon Buonaparte menacing the Allied Powers with a minatory long clay pipe ; but Rann, had he been painted sitting as he sat during this period of amazement, would have approached the presentment of"], [115, "\"THE AVONHAM MURDER.' 103 that majestic figure as nearly as possible. The Powers in his case were represented by the person of Mr. Timothy Rapsey, who quailed before the stern gaze. Certainly no foreign potentate could have terrified him more than did the market-clerk of Avonham. Some reply was, however, indispensable ; and, as soon as he was able to articulate, he gasped out his remonstrance in the form of supplication and question. \" Good Lor' 'a' mercy on us all, Mr. John Rann ! \" said he ; \" what ever in the world do ee mean r \" Lawks a daisy how ! \" said Beadlemore Arto, wiping his legs ; \" what a dreadful thing to say, Mr. Rann ! \" \" I mean it,\" said Rann. \" Now look here, Rapsey ; who was it sthred up all the strife and mischief when that gentleman at the ' Coombes ' and Mr. Shelman had that row outside ? Why, you ! \" Mr. Rann wdiacked the table again. \" Now, as it happens,\" he resumed, \" I know the rights o' that. You took your money out o' the Bank \" \" I was told to,\" interrupted Rapsey ; \" that weren't my fault at all.\""], [116, "104 TWO PARDONS. \" It weren't your fault at all ? \" said Mr. Rann excitedly ; \" yes, it were your fault at all, and no one else's ; you go a-talking to Mr. Galbraith's servant about Mr. Galbraith's windows being broke, as if his windows were more than anyone else's ; next thing you seem to make up your mind as that affair, and in deed all the whole riot, was got up by our side, with Mr. Shelman at the head of it. Pretty charge to bring ! Then comes w7hat you call being told to take your money out of the Bank. Of course you were told. Do you think a bank's going to stand your scandalising one of its chief partners ? Do you think the Bank wants your dirty money ? \" Mr. John Rann banged his open hand on the table again, and made the glasses dance ; the company looked as though Mr. Rapsey's money were really a disgrace to him, and its possession a species of crime. \" What's the cause of Parson Carter's son leaAing Bompas ? \" resumed the peppery mar ket-clerk ; \" you, and nobody else ! Oh, you needn't trouble yourself to deny it ; I know7 all about it ; never mind how7. You're going to say that Carter w7as attacking Mr. Galbraith's house, aren't you ?

I don't beheve as he've a done this murder no more than I believe Daddy Prosser's father done it ; but whoever done it, it was through bad blood stirred up in Avonham such as never was sthred up afore, and all through you, Timothy Rapsey.

Mr. Timothy Rapsey did not remain long after him. Although it was felt that Mr. Rann's partisanship and excitement were more the cause of his outbreak than any facts he had accumulated, yet the situation was decidedly uncomfortable for Timothy, and the flaArour seemed to go out of his tobacco all at once. He stood his ground for a little w7hile, however,"], [119, "\"THE AVONHAM MURDER.\" 107 but soon departed, lea\\ing his character behind him. Mr. R ami's speech, and the subject of the murder generaUy, had been pretty well threshed out, and two or three ofthe outlying farmers had driven away, when the lessening circle was increased by Doctor Mompesson, who had not been seen for a day or two. When he was seated Beadlemore Arto, after a little meditathe puffing at his pipe, asked : \" How's Mrs. Stanhope, doctor ? Poor t hing, I suppose she's ter'bly upset over this horrid affair.\" Doctor Mompesson seemed unusuaUy grave ; he shook his head. \" Very bad, very bad,\" he said ; \" very difficult case ; \" and he continued shaking his head as he lit his cigar. \" I'm sorry for that, doctor,\" said Pimiiffer, speaking amidst a general murmur of regret ; \" I thought the poor lady seemed to have been driven hah wild by the shock on Monday night. Dear heart ! I don't wonder at it.

Soon the com7ersation dried up altogether. John Rann's outbreak on the one hand, and the serious condition of Mrs. Stanhope on the other, acted as a damper on the spirits of eArery one in the room. The rest of the farmers wended their wray homewards. Old Mas'r KiUett and his dutiful son Avent home together, and still the doctor sat quietly smoking until at last he was left alone with Pinniffer.

He sat puffing away opposite the doctor for some time, until that worthy, wrho had sat with an unfilled glass before him for some time, and had been apparently oblivious of the fact that he had emptied it, stretched out his hand, groped for it a moment or two, raised it towards his hps, stayed his hand be-"], [121, "\"THE AVONHAM MURDER.\" 109 fore the glass reached his mouth, looked into the tumbler as though it were a \\7essel of surpassing interest w7hich he had never seen before, say a Druidical punch bowd, kept his eyes fixed on it for a minute, and then gave a short sigh and woke to a sense of the sur roundings. He looked OA7er at Pinniffer and laughed. \" Going off to sleep, I think,\" he said ; \" some more sherry and cold water, Pinniffer.\" This being supplied him, he sipped it once or twice, nodded approval, and settled himself for a quiet chat. Pinniffer told him the newrs of Rann's attack on Rapsey, to which he listened attentively, as though waiting to hear some statement that would clear up a doubt in his mind. Not finding one in the land lord's narrative, he shook his head again. \" Bad job,\" he said, \" bad job all round. Rann may be right ; Rann may be wrong.

It was a general day of moinning ; closed shutters, drawn blinds, and suspended trade were universal. From the country-side, hundreds came in to sweU the throng of townsfolk. What respect or esteem might not have been able to effect curiosity did, and the grief of the two great houses of Avonham was shared, so far as out ward demonstration went, by aU who from town or country-side could reach St. Hilde garde's that day.

He carried himself right nobly under his grief, though, as became a high-minded man such as he was.

Perhaps he came nearest to showing open emotion when, seeing Mr. Bold ham standing near the grave and looking, if possible, more grief- stricken than he, he made his way to him and held out his hand, which the other grasped in silence. An intuitive feeing that this was a meeting whose words and incidents were sacred things to aU but those two, kept eA'er yone aloof, but it was seen that Sir Headingly was the one who spoke, and that the banker, overwhelmed with grief and horror at the whole of the fearful affair, was totaUy unable to stem the current of his sorrow. Slowly the concourse filed out of the church yard, and dispersed among the streets ofthe town. Among those who had joined in the general expression of respect had of course been Mr. Bompas, and those wdio took note of such things observed that he stood between his neighbours at the \" Coombes,\" Bryceson and Markham.

They walked past Mr. Bompas's house and entered the gate of the \" Coombes.\" Arrived in the drawing-room of that establishment, a room which showed by its outward and visible signs, by its pipe-racks, fishing-rods, boxing-gloves, whips, guns, and other sporting paraphernalia, that it was a room devoted to the use of bachelors, Bryceson poked the fire into a blaze, and drew up the bind at the back French window, to admit light. \" No one can see in from the back,\" he said, apologetically, \" and the house has been so desperately gloomy all day, I reaUy can't stand it any longer.

He could not bear the silence that follow7ed the question. \" He is her first husband, Doctor Mom pesson, and he w7Ul arrive in AA7onham this evening.\" \" Good God ! \" said the Doctor, and his hat and Malacca cane fell with a crash on the floor. The feA7erish raAings ofthe sick-bed, hitherto almost unintelhgible to him, were now ex plained. \" Did you know of this before, Bompas ? \" he asked when he had recovered from his astonishment. \" On Sunday last, for the first time,\" an swered Mr. Bompas ; \" my daughter Adelaide told me.\""], [138, "126 TWO PARDONS. \" Adelaide ? \" said Doctor Mompesson, in intense surprise ; \" how ever came she to know anything of it ? \" \" She was informed of it by my friend Mr. Galbraith,\" said Bryceson, taking the answer out of Mr. Bompas's mouth. The Doctor stared at him as though this was more astonishing than anything he had yet heard. He turned to Mr. Bompas. \" It is so,\" said that w7orthy in reply to his friend's mute enquiry ; \" Mr. Galbraith and Adelaide are engaged to be married.\" There was a twinge of self-reproach felt as he said it. All his old friends had been kept in the dark. Fred Markham noticed his dis comfort and came to his rescue, to the greater edification of the puzzled Doctor. \" We are astonishing Doctor Mompesson in detail,\" said he. \" Mr. Bompas, wiU you give your friend an account of what we all know ?

With them the Doctor heartily and cordiaUy agreed. It was a sad tale to w7hich he had to hsten, told fairly and with modera tion by Mr. Bompas, and not interrupted by a word from either of the young men, but the Doctor had the natural partisanship of a Marl shire man for Marlshire things, and, whateA'er were the faults of this woman, she was the widow of his old friend, and he was prepared to defend her from oppression, even though he could not justify her actions. \" And there is one thing,\" he added as he was going away, \" about which you must not misunderstand me.

I am Mrs. Stanhope's medical attendant ; she is in no condition to be disturbed ; I shall allow no one to see her, on any business whateA'er.\" Bryceson bowred. \" That shall be faithfully reported to my friend Mr. Galbraith,\" said he. \" Yes,\" said the Doctor, gruffly enough, \" if you please, and tell Mr. Galbraith, moreoA7er, that this toAvn is full of Mrs. Stanhope's friends \u2014 friends w7ho have knowm her for some years, and her husband for many ; we shall require proof of wdiat you allege, Mr. Bryceson and Mr. Markham.

Mr. Bompas looked as though he feared that the heightened colour of the two friends betokened a coming explosion ; but he was mistaken. As the door slammed emphatically behind the Doctor, Bryceson smiled. He threw7 away his cigar, which had gone out, chose another, and passed his cigar-case to Markham. \" Your friend is a w7arm-hearted man appar ently, Mr. Bompas,\" he said, \" and \\7ery much in earnest.\" Mr. Bompas muttered a few7 words, eulogistic of the Doctor, but deprecatory of his last remark. \" Warm-hearted he may be,\" said Markham, pausing before striking a match, \" but, if you haA7e any influence with him, Mr. Bompas, and wish his patient weU \u2014 w7hich I beheve you sincerely do \u2014 I would adAise you to recommend VOL.

WhateA'er it can do now, there is only one chance between her and it, if we choose to invoke its aid.

Now-a-days there is a railw'ay service between the places, though the trains go a roundabout way, and cover twenty miles in bringing together the inhabitants of tw7o towns only ten miles apart by road, but at the time of our tale, the high way was the only means of intercommunica tion, and, on the morning of the trial, a string of vehicles left the smaller town for the larger. A few persons of position had managed to"], [154, "142 TWO PARDONS. secure seats in the court, but the majority, if they could not crowd in with the general public, would have only the solace of getting the news of the result a httle earlier than those who stayed behind. Beadlemore Arto drove Timothy Rapsey, Mr. Folhvell, and Mr. Polli moy in his high dog-cart, and Wolstenholme and Hoppenner Pye went fraternally in a gig which only held two ; Raraty took a party in a wagonette, and the three vehicles kept pretty close together and stayed at the same half way house. In the street of Ridgetown which fronted the Guildhall, there w7ere con stant recognitions passing between Avonham men, and many were the tricks, shifts, and man\u0153uvres employed by those who wanted places. Timothy Rapsey was delighted with a seat in the A7ery first row of the gallery, and exactly behind the dock. From this coign of A'antage o o he scanned the wdiole court, and gaA7e his less fortunate companions information concerning any notable wdiom he saw7. \" Mr. Semiett's a-talkin' to a taU l'yer in a wig ; I reckon that's him as is goin' to o \" o defend.\" \" KiUett ain't got no seat ; ail have to"], [155, "FOR WANT OF AX ABSENT AVITNESS. 143 stand ; oh, no, a' won't ; a've found one at last.\" \" Look 'ee there now ; there's Mr. Bompas up behind, and Mr. Galbraith wi' 'un.\" \" That's that old geniman stayhig wi' Mr. Galbraith o' t'other side o' Mr. Bompas.\" \" Lor', what a voice that crier 'a' got, to be sure !

When the judge had taken his seat, and the jury had been sworn, there was a stir in the court as the prisoner appeared. He bore him seU weU under the fire of eyes turned upon him, though his colour went and came. His plea of \" Not guilty \" was given in a clear and firm voice ; but he seemed to pay httle attention to the speech of the counsel for the Crown, occupying himseU in looking round"], [156, "144 TAVO PARDONS. the court and occasionally flushing as he caught the familiar countenance of some AA'onham man among the spectators. He saw the face of Galbraith, and sought eagerly for that of Bryceson near him ; not finding it, for Bryceson had too much manhood to be present, he turned again and scanned Gal braith's face. There was no hostility in it ; turning again, he caught a friendly visage, that of John Rann, Avho smiled and nodded to him as though to bid him be of good heart ; he answered him with a smile. He heeded the trial A'ery httle at first. Would that prosy man, heaping fact on fact against him, neA'er be done ? There was Adolphus Carter sitting with his ftither, close to Mr. Bompas. Pleasant for him ! Half Avonham was here to see him tried. Hoav many would come to see him wdien That would be in the open air, too, and there would be more room for them than in the court. Thank God ! there wrere no Avonham women there to gloat OA7er him in his mis fortune. Had Galbraith ridden over on the horse that he bought in spite of him ?"], [157, "FOR WANT OF AN ABSENT AVITNESS. 145 He had seen him once riding with ; ah, thank goodness the speech was finished at last ! Such were his thoughts after that first sur vey of the court and the faces familiar to him. They were succeeded by a kind of dull interest in the evidence. It w7as so great a nuisance having to stand there before all those common vulgar people, that he might as weU try to get some amusement from the witnesses. He took notice of them as of the actors in a slow play, he was anxious for the end of it to come but the plot had httle attraction for him. Those busy men, writing just in front of him, would describe him as being quite calm and cool during the progress of the trial ; they would praise his command of feature and his courage. In reahty he felt as unconcerned as any spectator in court. The end was near now. The witnesses had been examined and cross-examined, the counsel for the defence had made wdiat every one to-night and to-morrow would describe as a grand speech, and the judge was calmly and dispassionately going over the evidence and summing up to the jury. The examination both of Jacob Starer, who w7as terribly ner- vol in. 42"], [158, "146 TAVO PARDONS. vous, and, even in his simple tale, contradicted himseU once or twice, and of Lightfoot, who had given some vague evidence as to the time of his hearing the shots, had roused great in- terest, and their testimony had not been so unfavourable to the prisoner at the trial as it had been at the inquest. The wisdom of a reserved defence was seen, and Mr. Sennett was praised for his tactical skill by all his Avonham townsfolk during the intenal for luncheon. Lightfoot could not swear wiiether or no the gun was capped or cocked w7hen he saw it on the bridge. Jacob Starer admitted that he had been more anxious to get the body of Walter Rhers out of the water than to notice its position as it lay. These were points in favour of the prisoner. The doctor's evi- dence and opinion as to the cause of death had not, however, been shaken. He did not beheve that the deceased in handling the gun, perhaps with an idea of causing it to be restored to its owner, had accidentally shot himself ; the a\\ ounds, he thought, could not have been seU-infbcted. But the supposition had been well handled in the defending counsel's speech, and Mr. Sinclair had made the most of it, and of each of the other points ;"], [159, "FOR WANT OF AN ABSENT WITNESS. 147 there was much doubt now in the minds of the spectators, and John Rann's face was radiant. But there was that Aiolent quarrel on the bridge to be disposed of, the wiser heads thought. The judge finished a masterly summing up, the conclusion of which was solemn in its mention of the issues involved, and of the duty ofthe jury to their country and their feUow man alike, and the jury withdrew. There was the usual buzz of subdued con versation in the court during their absence ; the judge left the bench, the prisoner was removed from the dock. A quarter of an hour \u2014 haU an hour \u2014 an hour passed, and the jury had not returned. Lights were set hi the court as the winter day waned, and stiU they waited. The issue of what was passing in the jury room we shaU see presently. Let us look at something which is going on in the court. The actors are two, and theh action is quite silent and unobserved. It consists simply of one man watching another. Candles have just been brought, and the court is weU Ughted where they sit. 42\u20142"], [160, "148 TWO PARDONS. The man w7ho is watched holds a handker chief in his hands, and is twisting and wring ing it till its threads are giving w7ay, and it is full of holes, and shredded and torn in twenty places ; from time to time he wipes from his brow great cold drops of sweat, which stand there in pearl-like beads. His lips are wiiite, and he rubs them furtiA'elv now7 and then, as though he knew their pallor and sought to give them colour. He has been taking notes of the trial, but has crumpled them up in his hand and is clutching them tightly as he w7renches and tugs at his handkerchief. When he wipes his brow he shifts the paper into his left hand, but takes it again in his right, when that is done, and keeps it furtively in the hollow of his hand. When the fights were brought he made a movement of im patience, and, for some minutes, shaded his eyes with his hand as though they were affected by the glare. From time to time he looks about him as if to see Avhether people are observing him, more than to notice them or their doings. Surely the prisoner himseU cannot be under stronger emotion, as he waits for the verdict, than this man. The man watching can only see one side of"], [161, "FOR WANT OF AN ABSENT WITNESS. 149 his face except when he turns, but he never takes his gaze from him and watches with eyes well used to watch, and notes every twitch and gesture. There is a stir in the court, for the judge has been sent for, and the prisoner is again in the dock. The jury enter, and theh names are called amid a silence deep and great, broken only by the voices of the clerk and the jurymen. AU ears are opened for the verdict, all eyes turned to the jury-box. AU saAre two ; the watcher ne\\\"er takes his eyes from the face of the man whom he is watching. \" How say you, gentlemen ? Do you find the prisoner guilty or not guilty of wilful murder ? \" \" Guilty ! \" A flush comes into the face of the man watched ; then it dies out ; he half turns to the one who sits by his side, his eyes close, his hands relax their grip of what they have held so firmly, his head bends forward, and he falls with a loud crash on the floor. There is confusion in the court as he is removed, and a county magistrate whispers to"], [162, "150 TWO PARDONS. the sheriff, who whispers to the judge, that it is a great friend of the prisoner, overcome by the verdict. \" Prisoner at the bar ! Have you anything to say why sentence of death should not be passed upon you ? \" The prisoner lifts his eyes towards the judge, and there is not a tremor in his A7oice as he says: \" My lord ! One witness has been want ing at this trial, the man wdio fired the shot that kiUed Walter Rh7ers ! That man will be found one day, and the j my will hVe to see that their verdict was wrong. Before my Maker, I swear that I am innocent! \" In a broken voice, and with great emotion, the judge passes sentence of death. He feels bound to say that the jury have done theh duty and that their A7erdiet is according to the eAidence. He entreats the prisoner to use the time remaining to him in repentance. His own Aiolent passions haA'e brought him to this position, a fearful one for a man of his station in the world. He can hold out no hope ; nothing remains but to pass the sentence of the law. And the dread words are said in a hushed and awe- stricken court."], [163, "FOR WANT OF AN ABSENT WITNESS. 151 Then the prisoner is remoAred and goes out of sight, and the crowd file out into the street. \"I do not want to see another man sentenced to death,\" says Mr. Bompas, as the four friends are waiting for their horses at the hotel after the trial. \" Nor I,\" said Markham. \" Pah I this sherry tastes of the gaUows and the hemp ! \" \" Nor I,\" says the old Squire. \" I shall dream of his face aU night, poor fellow ! \" \" Nor I,\" says Galbraith last of aU, \" parti cularly when he is not guilty.\" The three others stare at him. \" Not guilty ! \" \" Yes ; I do not belieA7e that man is guilty.\" \" Do you believe what he said about that missing witness ? \" says Fred Markham. \" I do ; I believe he will be found and very shortly too.\" \" How will he be found ?

Of course the scenes of the day had been of too grave a nature, and coming events were too serious, for the party assembled at Mr. Bompas's to be a v7ery joA'ial one, yet Adelaide noticed that Galbraith seemed more than usually preoccupied, and asked him somewhat anxiously, when he took his leave, what had occurred to disturb him. He kissed her, and laughingly said that nothing AA'as wrong, that he w7as a selfish fellow7 and ought to be banished, but that he had something special to think out by the morning and that he would teU her all in a day or tw7o. He thought it out after his guests had re tired to rest. Thought it out long and pain fuUy into the small hours of morning. When his task w7as done he locked two sheets of torn and crumpled paper in a private drawer and went to bed himself, perfectly satisfied with the result of his night's work."], [165, "CHAPTER IX. A PERIOD OF SUSPENSE. In total ignorance of the far heaAder cloud that hung over her, the good folks of Avon ham received with quiet joy the news of the restoration to health of theh chief Lady. Doctor Mompesson's praises were sounded at every tea-table hi the place, and the good Doctor was openly congratulated by every one who met him. To him, who, as we know, had his secret to carry about with him, these demonstrations were awkward, and he went about the streets looking so very grave that folks wondered at it and said to one another that the anxiety of the case had told upon the old man. That it was anxiety which made him so glum was true, but it was caused by the downfall of an idol, the shatter ing of an illusion. Docter Mompesson had lost no time in seeing Galbraith. The day after the arrival of the latter in Avonham, the Doctor had waited upon him, and what Mark-"], [166, "154 TAVO PARDONS. ham had prophesied to Mr. Bompas had come true. No graver mistake could have been made than to attempt to assist Mrs. Stanhope by attacking Galbraith. This is what the Doctor had done. It went so against him to have to beheve anything against the woman, that he turned blindly obstinate and refused to beheve. He went to Galbraith burning with self-irritation. He demanded rather than asked for proof ; he posed as the self-con stituted champion of a lady whom he. alleged to be lying under a false accusation, and he started the war by what he considered a justi fiable raid on the enemy's country. Now, to stir up strife is always dangerous, and to attack a man who has a grievance, using against him as a weapon a derision of and disbelief in that grie\\7ance, is something like arousing a rattlesnake. You may be able to get safely away, but it is most certain that you will have to move ! Doctor Mompesson had to abandon his first position precipitately. \" I have listened patiently to you, sir,\" said Galbraith, \" from respect for your age, and your honoured and honourable position in this town, but you are exceeding the privileges both of your years and your station.\""], [167, "A PERIOD OF SUSPENSE. 155 \" I have taken upon me,\" answered the Doctor, \"to speak on behalf of a lady whom aU Avonham loves and admhes, and who, I consider, is being most unjustifiably slandered and abused.\" Galbraith's colour rose and his temper with it. This was hard for any man to bear. \" You are speaking on behaU of a woman,\" he said, \" whom I and my friends know to be an adulteress, and haA7e good reason for supposing to be a bigamist. You are the champion of a worthy cause, I must say ! \" \" Sh,\" said the Doctor in a great heat, \" I do not belieA7e one w7ord of your accusation against my friend and patient. From begin ning to end it's a cock-and-buU story \" \" Which you shall haA7e speedy opportunity for testing,\" said Galbraith. \" I wiU at once apply for a warrant against your friend and patient for having committed bigamy, and if she can disprove the charge I will apologise to you. I wish you good morning, sir.\" And he rose from his seat and rang the bell so sharply that Edward answered it at the double. Now, the Doctor, though an obstinate, was liot an utterly pig-headed man, and he at once"], [168, "156 TWO PARDONS. saw that he had gone too far with this young man. \" Stay one moment, Mr. Galbraith,\" said he, swallowing his hritation and speaking more calmly, \" I am wrong to be hasty with you ; I am sorry I w7as so ; let me haA'e a little more conversation with you.\" Galbraith signed to Edward, who stood in the doorwray, and the negro withdrew. \" Doctor Mompesson,\" said Galbraith when they were alone again, \" I cannot blame you for your championship of your friend's widow .

Let us wait.\" So they parted excellent friends, each with a hearty admiration for the other. For three weeks Mrs. Stanhope lay between hfe and death, but at last the Doctor was able to pronounce her out of danger, and, as we haA'e seen, there was universal joy in Avonham over the fact. During those w7eeks no whisper of anything beyond the fact of her illness had leaked out in the town. Avonham had plenty to interest it meanwhile"], [170, "158 TWO PARDONS. in the trial, the result of which w7e saw in our last chapter, and also in the fact of the house - hold at the \" Coombes \" having increased in numbers. Mrs. Hackett reported that Mr. Galbraith had a housekeeper now and a hoity toity cook from London, if you please ; and folks gathered that the alteration did not suit her. Raraty had to put up three more horses for Galbraith, who had purchased them of Hart, and that worthy sent down with them a couple of grooms, who lived in lodgings in the town and patronised Raraty' s stablemen with great condescension. Mr. Pimnffer's face brightened when he mentioned casuaUy the transactions Avhich the gentlemen in South Street had with him, and the gossips ofthe Avonham tea-tables began to throw out dark hmts of the relations between the three young men and the Misses Bompas. The oldest member of the band was speedily high in favour in the town, and Doctor Mompesson and Mr. MiUard when they heard his name, received it with aU the honour due to it. It was not long before the county paper informed its readers that the guest of the pro prietor of the \" Coombes \" was an American savant whose fame had spread ovrer two con tinents, and so the house and its occupiers"], [171, "A PERIOD OF SUSPENSE. 159 became more important than ever. The minds of the smaU fry were somewitat exercised by the Squire's presence, as they looked on him somewhat in the hght of a new kind of bogy, respectable but not the less dangerous. The negro had been at first somewhat uncanny in theh eyes, and now7 that he was supplemented by one whom they considered as a superior wizard, their courtesy increased with their fear, and no one w7as more respectfully received in the streets by the schoolboys than Galbraith and his friends. So time went on and Mrs. Stanhope re covered, and Shelman was tried ; with what result w7e have seen. The thne of Christmas was approaching fast. The town had had its Agricultural Show, at which local fat oxen had been punched, pinched and criticised, and root crops weighed and poultry shown ; and after it meritorious farm labourers had received sides of bacon or silver medals, apparently as a reward for having been content to cling to the same acres of soil for their existence during five-sixths of their slow, hard, dead-level hves, an existence scarcely higher than that of the horses they drove or the hounds theh masters walked ; farmers"], [172, "160 TAVO PARDONS. round had got theh orders for Christmas tur keys, and Killett's mind was weighed down by the fact that oxen, even at Christmas, are not entirely composed of sirloin ; Pinniffer's spirit bottles had burst out with seasonable labels representing a white-headed, snowy-bearded Silenus, crowned with holly, discussing a bowi of punch ; the grocers' w7indows were filled with raisins and candied peel, and aU the other signs of the festive season were at hand. \" I doubt very much, Walter,\" said Galbraith to Bryceson, one afternoon, as they walked up the town together, the three other inmates of the \" Coombes \" having run over to Bath for the day, \" whether, with all this confounded w7orry OA'er our heads, I shall be able to offer you feUows a A-ery merry Christmas ; I wish with all my heart that whatever is to happen would happen soon, and that we knew7 the end of every thing.\" \" And so do I, my dear fellow ; but at any rate, let us be as cheerful as we can until we know7 the worst or the best of our troubles.

Come ! throw away your cares for the time, Harry, and let us be gay. Look at Pinniffer standing at his door, bidding that old fellow on the cob farew7ell. He looks positively medi\u00e6val.

He was easily per suaded to dismount, and the three ascended the steps of the hotel together. There was no one in the parlour when they entered, and they were soon making merry over a small bowl of punch of Mrs. Pinniffer's own brewing. \" When do any of you mean to pay me a visit at Beytesbury? \" asked Mr. MiUard. \"Mrs. MiUard is saving some cherry brandy for you, Mr. Bryceson, which, she declares, shall beat anything she has hitherto attempted in that line and shall be the very best you eA7er tasted.

Galbraith did not speak himself, but taking out his cigar-case handed it to his friends. Both accepted the proffered weeds, and during the process of cutting, lighting, and starting his Cabana, Mr. O\" O O? O Millard did not resume. When he had seen the first portion of white ash appear and was satisfied that aU was w7ell, he continued his remarks on the murder. \" I have always known,\" said he, \" that Shelman was a young fellow of imperious habits and OA'erbearing manners.

I will tell you why that is so.\" Galbraith nodded again, and settled himself to listen, with every outw7ard mark of attention, to the speaker. \" I told you just now,\" said Mr. MiUard, leaning back in his seat and puffing slowly at his cigar, \" that I did not beUeve any of the many rumours flying about as to the cause of any very desperate quarrel between young Shelman and poor Rh'ers. I know, of course, that they wrere quarrelling A'iolently just at the time the affair happened, but I cannot for the hfe of me see any cause for matters having gone so far as that Shelman should shoot Rivers, either in hot blood or cold blood, no matter what was the subject of their dispute.\" \" But what theory have you formed upon the matter ? \" asked Bryceson in a tone w7hich showed that he was not much impressed by the depth or sagacity of Mr. Millard's remarks up to the present. \" I beheve,\" said Mr. MiUard, \" that there was a struggle betwreen the two young men and that, in that struggle, the gun went off"], [178, "166 TWO PARDONS. and shot AValter Rivers. I wonder that that w7as not the defence set up.\" \" I don't quite see how7 they could set up that defence,\" said Bryceson. \" I understand that, not only at the inquest but at aU times, Shelman has strenuously denied struggling with Rh'ers at all.\" \" Well,\" said Mr. Millard, shrugging his shoulders and apparently giving up the thing as a bad job, \"as I said before, the whole thing is a mystery to me, although the facts seem plain and on the surface ; if the theory of a struggle and an accidental discharge of the gun be not correct, I give up all hopes of eA7er be ing able to explain the affair.

As they stood a minute hesitatingly on the steps of the \" Bear,\" the obsequious and observant Timothy Rapsey entered the door way and gave them an effusive \" good eA7ening.\" Galbraith immediately turned back and followed Timothy to the room they had just left. Timothy's nature was clastic. Dashed as he had been by John Rann's A'igorous denuncia tion of his inquisitiveness, he had recovered his perky manner and was just as eager for any information as ever. Friends had intervened between him and John Rann, and the pair had shaken hands with great formahty and solem nity at their next meeting ; now he thought he saw another chance of adding to his store of knowledge of his neighbours. \" Nice seasonable weather, gentlemen,\" said he as the friends entered the room. \" Very,\" said Galbraith. \" I am glad to see Mrs. Stanhope out driving again,\" said Timothy."], [182, "170 TWO PARDONS. \" Oh, is she sufficiently recovered to be about ? \" asked Bryceson. \" Oh, yes,\" said Timothy. \" Indeed I think she has been paying you a visit, Mr. Galbraith, this afternoon.\" \" Paying me a visit ! \" said Galbraith, look ing at his friend in surprise, \" how do you know7 that ? \" \" I was coming along South Street about an o o hour ago,\" said little Chatterbox, \" and Mrs. Stanhope's carriage stopped at your gate.

Well, she will find us all at our stations wiien she comes.\" They passed the carriage standhig outside Mr. Bompas's door, and entered at theh own gate.

Anyone at home ? \" \" No, sah, dar ain't none of 'em come back, but dey won't be long now.\" Galbraith and Bryceson entered the room and the negro brought them lamps. By their hght Bryceson noticed that his friend's face was A7ery set and stern. When they had sat for about fi\\7e minutes quite silent and each occupied with his own thoughts, there came a knock at the front door. Galbraith turned and pitched his cigar into the fire. Then he looked at Walter and laughed. \" Stand by to repel boarders,\" he said. \" I w7ant you to stay here with me, old fellow7 _ We are all brothers in this.\" The door opened, and Adelaide Bompas entered the room, followed by Mrs. Stanhope. Both men rose. Bryceson handed a chair to Adelaide, w7ho took it without speaking. There was no need of explanation. It wranted but one glance at each of the other two to reahse the fact that they had met for strife.

AT THE SOUND OF A WELL-KNOWN VOICE. There was a difference in the manner of each of these duelists. Whilst Galbraith was really calm, Mrs. Stanhope was only apparently so. She had nerved herseU for the encounter and the effort had been a great one. She had been forced to confess to herself that her enterprise wras desperate, and one thought troubled her more than all. She had a hundredfold more at stake than the man with whom she was about to fight. In the old wild days of her Bohemian exist ence there would have been for her no such thing as loss of station to dread. Her rare beauty and her gift of song had been the weapons w7hereAvith she had faced the world, and faced it successfully too. The surround ings of such a life have a tendency to harden the nerves and strengthen the heart of a woman, though very often quite the reverse is the result of their influence on a man. When"], [187, "AT THE SOUND OF A AVELL-KNOAA'N A7OICE. 175 she had exchanged this life for the humdrum existence of the married state, she had found respectabihty and regularity intolerable. An indulgent and fond husband had no attractions for her. To a man w7ho was stern, and eA7en harsh to her, she would haA'e clung with all the strength of her heart ; but she despised the good-natured and easy-going Reginald, and fled from him with one unworthy either to be compared with him or to be associated with her. The first rush of loAre for her deserted husband had come over her after the deadly injury she had done him, for she then first knew that under his quiet nature lay the highest courage and the firmest resolve. She remembered now how her terrified paramour, with face ever white and hand ever trembling, had carried her from place to place, from town to tow7n, and how the injured husband had foUowed hke a sleuth hound, till, in spite of every device, they had found no rest for the soles of their feet, and a week's consecutive residence in one place had been a matter of im possibility.

She remembered how, when at last news AA'as brought her that all was OA'er and that they need fear no more, the tide of revulsion Avhich had set in in her heart, now filled it with loathing for the partner of her crime and pity and affection for the dead. Francois Grenier had but little cause to triumph after he had told her the story. In a w7hirlwind of wild regrets she had torn herself from his embrace and loaded him with reproaches so bitter and scorn so scathing that they rang in his ears tiU he died : till the morning when he faced Galbraith underneath the trees on the low-lying shore on w7hich the lazy waves were plashing, Avhen he felt the blue eyes, stern and pitiless, conquer his own, when he gripped his knife and tried to feel that he could win the fight ; wiien the face in which he could see the hkeness to the man Avhom he had left at Baton Rouge, shot by treachery, drew nearer and nearer and he could mark the breadth of those shoulders, and guess ' o at the strength of that terrible right arm.

She knew nothing of his fate. She had dreaded his reappearance at one time, but the feeling had worn off since her husband's death, and eA7en had he appeared, she w7ould have felt secure in her knowiedge of the man's character and the easy manner in which she could have silenced him. But this man was different. How inexpressibly dear was her social position to her now ! It had been but a httle kingdom OA7er wilich she had reigned, but her O O ' sw7ay had been undisputed and she had been very happy there. Now there wras this one struggle to come, and then she must lay down sceptre and robe and turn her back on her subjects. Oh, for one hour of her old wild courage !
