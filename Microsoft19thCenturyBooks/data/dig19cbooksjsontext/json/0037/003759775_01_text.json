It is hung with heavy silken and damask furnishin.' ; nodding feathers are at its corners \u2014 covered with dust are they, and they lend a funereal aspect to the room. The floor is of polished oak. God ! how the hail dashes on the old bay window ! Like an occasional discharge of mimic musketry, it comes clashing, beat ing, and cracking upon the small panes ; but they resist it \u2014 their small size saves them ; the wind, the hail, the rain, expend their fury in vain. The bed in that old chamber is occupied. A creature formed in all fashions of loveli ness lies in a half sleep upon that ancient couch \u2014 a girl, young grid beautiful as a spring morning. Her lo'ng hair has escaped from its confinement, and streams over the blackened coverings of the bedstead ; she has been restless in her sleep, sor the cloth ing of the bed is in much confusion. One arm is over her head, the other hangs nearly off the side of the bed near to which she lies. A neck and bosom that would have formed a study for the rarest sculptor that ever Providence gave genius to, were halt disclosed. She moaned slight:y in her sleep, and once or twice the lips moved as if in prayer \u2014 at least one might judge so, for the name of Him who suffered for all came once saintly from them. It was as if some giant had blown upon some toy town, and scattered many of the buildings before the hot blast of his terrific breath ; for as suddenly as that blast of wind had come did it cease, and all was as still and calm as before. Sleepers awakened, and thought that wbat they had heard must be the confused chimera of a dream. They trembled and turned to sleep again. All is still\u2014 still as the very grave. Not a sound breaks the magic of repose. What is that \u2014 a strange, pattering noise, as of a million of fairy feet ? It is hail \u2014 yes, a hail-storm has burst over the city. Leaves are dashed from the trees, mingled with small boughs ; windows that lio most op posed to the direct fury of the pelting par ticles of ice are broken, and the rapt re pose that before was so remarkable in its intensity, is exchanged for a noise whicb, in its accumulation, drowns every cry of surprise or consternation which here and there arose from persons wbo found their houses invaded by the storm. Now and then, too, there would come a sudden gust of wind, that in its strength, as it blew laterally, would, for a moment, hold millions of the hailstones suspended in mid air, but it was only to dash them with re doubled force in some new direction, where more mischief was to de done. She has endured much fatigue, and the storm does not awaken her ; but it can dis turb the slumbers it does not possess the power to destroy entirely. The turmoil of the elements wakes the senses, although it cannot entirely break the repose they have lapsed into. Oh, what a world of witchery was in that moMth, slightly parted, and exhibiting within the pearly teeth that glistened even in the faint light that came from that bay window ! How s weetly the long silken eye lashes lay upon the cheek. Now she moves, and one shoulder is entirely visible \u2014 whiter, fairer than the spotless clothing of the bed on wbich she hes, is the smooth skin of that fair creature, just budding into womanhood, and in that transition state which presents to us all che charms of the girl \u2014 almost of the child, with the more matured beauty and gentlenessof advancing years. Was tbat lightning ? Yes\u2014 an awful, vivid, terrifying flash\u2014 then a roaring peal of thunder, as if a thousand mountains were rolling one over the other in the blue vault of Heaven ! Who sleeps now in that ancient city ? Not one living soul. The Ob, how the storm raged ! Hail \u2014 rain wind. It was, iu very truth, an awful night. * \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 There is an antique chamber in an an cient house. Curious and quaint carvings adorn the walls, and the large chimney piece is a curiosity of itself. The ceiling is low, and a large bay window, from roof to floor, looks to the west. The window is latticed, and filled with curiously painted glass and rich stained pieces, which send in a strange, yet beautiful light, when sun or moon shines into the apartment. There is but one portrait in that room, although the walls seem panelled for the express pur pose of containing a series of pictures. That portrait is of a young man, with a pale face, a stately brow, and a strange expression about the eyes, which no one tared to look on twice. There is a stately bed in that chamber,"], [11, "THE FEAST OF BLOOD- 3 dread trumpet of eternity could not more effectually have awakened any one. The hail continues. The wind continues. The uproar of the elements seems at its height. Now she awakens\u2014 that beautiful girl on tbe antique bed ; she opens those eyes of celestial blue, and a faint cry of alarm burst from her lips. At least it is a cry which, amid the noise and turmoil with out, sounds but faint and weak. She sits upon the bed, and presses her hands upon her eyes. Heavens ! what a wild torrent of wind, and rain, and hail! The thunder likewise seems intent upon awakening sufficient echoes to last until the next flash of forked lightning should again produce the wild concussion ofthe air. She mur- and clattering of tbe nails continue. No word is spoken, and now she fancies she can trace the darker form of that figure against the window, and she can see the long arms moving to and fro, feeling sor some mode of entrance. What strange light is that which now gradually creeps up into the air? red aud terrible \u2014 brighter and brighter it grows. The lightning has set fire to a mill, and the reflection of the rapidly consuming building falls upon that long window. There cau be no mistake. The figure is there, still feeling for an en- trance, and scratching against the glass with its long nails, that appear as if the growth of many years had been untouched. She tries to scream again, but a choking sensa- tion comes over her, and she cannot. It is too dreadful \u2014 she tries to move \u2014 each limb seems weighed down by tons of lead \u2014 she can but in a hoarse fain' whisper cry, \u2014 \"Help\u2014 help \u2014 help \u2014 help !\" And that one word she repeats like i person in a dream. The red glare of the fire continues. It throws up the tall gaunt figure in hideous relief against the long window. It shines, too, upon the one por- trait that is in the chamber, and that por- trait appears to fix its eyes upon the at- tempting intruder, while the flickering light j from the fire makes it look fearfully life- like. A small pane of glass is broken, and the form from without introduces a long gaunt hand, which seem* utterly destitute of flesh. The fastening ia removed, and one-half of the window, which opens like folding doors, is swung wide open upon its | hinges. murs a prayer \u2014 a prayer for those she loves best ; the names of those dear to her gentle heart come from her lips ; she weeps and prays; she thinks then of what devastation the storm must surely produce, and to the j great God of Heaven she prays for all living things. Another flash \u2014 a wild, blue, bewildering flashof lightning streams across that bay window, for an instant bringing o it every colour in it with terrible distinct ness. A shriek bursts from the lips of the young girl, and then, with eyes fixed upon that window, which, in another moment, is all darkness, and with such an expres sion of terror upon her face as it had never bjfore known, she trembled, and the per spiration of intense fear stood upon her b o\\v. \" What \u2014 what was it?\" she gasped ; ! \" real, or a delusion ? Ob, God, what was it ? A figure, tall and gaunt, endeavouring from the outside to unclasp the window. I saw it. That flash of lightniDg revealed it to me. It stood the whole length of the window.\" And yet now she could not scream \u2014 she could not move. \" Help ! \u2014help ! \u2014 help !\" was all she could say. But, oh, that look of terror that sat upon her face, it was dreadful \u2014 a look to haunt the memory for a life-time \u2014 a look to obtrude itself upon the happiest moments, and turn them to bitterness. The figure turns half round, and tne light falls upon tbe face. It is perfectly white \u2014 perfectly bloodless. The eyes look like polished tin ; the lips are drawn bacl-e, and the principal feature next to those dreadful eyes is the teeth \u2014 the fearful look ing teeth \u2014 projecting like those of some wild animal, hideously, glaringly white, and fang-like. It approaches the bed with a strange, gliding movement. It clashes together the long nails that literally appeal to hang from the finger ends. No sounc'r comes from its lips. Is she going mad that youug and beautiful girl exposed tc so much terror ? She has drawn up ali her limbs ; she cannot even now say help Thi. power of articulation is gone, but the por/e: There was a lull ofthe wind. The hail was not falling so thickly \u2014 moreover, it now fell, what there was of it, straight, and yet a strange clattering sound came upon the glass of that long window. It could not be a delusion \u2014 she is awake, and she hears it. What can produce it? Another flash of lightning \u2014 another shriek \u2014 there could be now no delusion. A tall figure is standing on the ledge immediately outside the long window. It is its finger* nails upon the glass that pro duces the sound so like the hail, now that the hail has ceased. Intense fear paralysed tho limbs of that beautiful girl. That one 6trriek is all she can utter \u2014 with hands clasped, a face ot marble, a heart beating so wildly in her bosom that each moment it seems as if it would break its confines, eyes distended and fixed upon the window, Bhe waits, froze with horror. The pattering"], [12, "VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE ; OR, 4 of movement has returned to her ; she can 1 draw herself slowlv along ro the other side of the bed from that towards which the hideous appearance is coming. But her eves are fascinated. The glance of a serpent could not have produced a greater effect upon her thau did the fixed gsze of those awfu', metallic- looking eyes that were bent on her face. Crouching down so that the gigantic height was lost, and the horrible, protruding, white face was the most prominent object, came on the figure. AVhat was it?\u2014 what did it want there?\u2014 what made it look so hide- ens\u2014 so unlike an inhabitant of the earth, and yet to be on it? Now she has got to the verge ofthe bed, and the figure pauses. It seemed as if when it paused she lost the power to pro- ceed. The clothing of the bed was now clutched in her hands with unconscious power. She drew her breath short aud thick. Her bosom heaves, and her limbs tremble, yet she cannot withdraw her eyes from that marble-looking face, lie holds her with h s glittering eye. The storm has ceased\u2014 all is still. The winds are hushed ; the church clock pro- c aims the hour of one: a hissing sound c jmes from the throat ofthe hideous being, and he raises his long, gaunt arms\u2014 the lips move. He advances. The girl places one small foot from the bed on to the floor. She is unconsciously dragging the clothing with her. The door of the room is in that i direction\u2014 can she reach it ? Has she power to walk ? \u2014 can she withdraw her eyes from the face of the intruder, and so b'eak the hideous charm ? God of Heaven ! is it real, or some dream so like reality as to nearly overturn the judgment s_rr ever ? ) The figure has paused again, and half on the bed and half out of it that young girl lies trembling. Her long hair streams across the entire width of the bed. As she has slowly moved along, she has left it streaming across the pillows. The pause lasted about a minute \u2014 -oh, what an age of I atjony ! That minute was, intleed, enough lor madness to do its full work in ! With a sudden rush that could not be foreseen \u2014 with a strange howling cry that was enough to awaken terror in every breast, the figure seized the long tresses of her hair, and twining them round his bory hands, he held her to the bed. Then she screamed \u2014 Heaven granted her then pe tver to scream. Shriek followed shriek ir, rapid succession. Tho bed-clothes fell in a heap by tho side of the bed \u2014 she was dragged by her long silken hair com- ! jiletely on to it a^ain. Her beautifully- rounded limbs quivered with the agony of her soul. The glassy, horrible eyes of the figure ran over that angelic lorm with a hideous satisfaction\u2014 horrible profanation. He drags hor head to the bed's edge\u2014 he forces it back by the long hair still en twined in his grasp. With a plunge, he seizes her neck in his fang-like teeth\u2014 a gush of blood, and a hideous sucking noise follows.

There was an univer sal stir and c ommotion among the in habitants, \" D:d you hear a scream, Harry?\" asked a young man, half-dressed, as he walked ir,to the chamber of another about his owl age. \" I did\u2014 whence was it?\" \" God knows. I dressed myself di rectly.\" \" All is still now.\" \" Yes ; but unless I was dreaming there was a scream.\" \" We could not both dream there was. Where did you think it came from?\" \u2022'It burst so suddenly upon my ears that I cannot say.\" There was a tap now at the door of tho room were these young men were, and a female voice said,\u2014 \"For God's sake, get up!\" \"We are up,\" said both the young men, appearing. \" Did you hear anything?\" \" Yes, a scream.\" \"Oh, search the house \u2014 search the house ; where did it come from \u2014 can you \u2022 tdl?\" \" Indeed we cannot, mother.\" Another person now joined the party. He was a man of middle age, and, as ho 1 came up to them, ha said, \u2014 \" Good God ! what is the matter?\" Scarcely had the words passed his lips, '"], [13, "THE FEAST OF BLOOD. 5 than sucb a rapid succession of shrieks came upon their ears, that they felt abso lutely stunned by them. Theelderlylady, whom one of the young men had called mother, fainted, and would have fallen to the floor of the corridor in which they all stood, had 6he not been promptly sup ported by the last comer, who himself staggered, as those piercing cries came upon the night air. He, however, was the first to recover, for the young men seemed paralysed. \"Henry,\" he cried, \"for God's sake support your mother. Can you doubt that these cries come from Flora's room ?\" it, but it did move, with a harsh, cracking sonnd. \" Push it,\" cried he who was tuing the bar, \" push the door at the same time.\" The younger man did so. For a few moments the massive door resisted. Then, suddenly, something gave way with a loud snap \u2014 it was a part of the lock \u2014 and the door at once swung wide open. How true it is that we measure time by the events which happen within a given space of it, rather than by its actual dura tion ! To those who were engaged in foicing open the door of the antique chamber, whereslepttheyounggiil whom they named Flora, each moment was swelled into an hour of agony ; but, in reality, from tbe first moment of tbe alarm to that when the loud cracking noise heralded the destruc tion of the fastenings of the door, there had elapsed but very few minutes indeed. \"It opens \u2014 it opens !\" cried the young man. The young man mechanically supported his mother, and then thc man who had just spoken darted back to his own bed-room, from whence he returned in a moment with a pair of pistols, and shouting \u2014 \"Follow me, who can !\" he bounded across the corridor in the direction of ihe antique apartment, from whence the cries proceeded, but wbich were now hushed. That house was built for strength, and the doors were all of oak, and of consider able thickness. Unhappily they had fast enings within, 60 that when the man reached the chamber of her who so much required help, he was helpless, for the door Was fast. \"Another moment,\" said the stranger, as he still plied the crow-bar \u2014 \" another moment, and we shall have free ingress to the chamber. Be patient.\" This stranger's name was Marchdale ; and, even as he spoke, he succeeded in throwing the massive door wide open, and clearing the passage to the chamber. To rush in with a light in his hand was the work of a moment to the young man named Henry ; but the very rapid pro gress he made into the apartment prevented him from observing accurately what it contained, for the wind that came in from the open window caught the flame of tbe candle, and although it did not actually extinguish it, it blew it so much on one side, that it was comparatively useless as a light. \" Flora\u2014 Flora !\" he cried. \" Flora ! Flora !\" he cried ; \" Flora, speak !\" All was still. \" Good God !\" he added ; \" we must force the door.\" \" I hear a strange noise within,\" said the young man, who trembled violently. \" And so do I. What does it sound like ?\" \" I scarcely know ; but it nearest resem bles some animal eating, or sucking some liquid.\" \" What on earth can it be ? Have you no weapon that will force the door ? I shall go mad if I am kept here.\" \" I have,\" said the young man. \" Wait here a moment.\" Then, with a sudden bound, something dashed from off the bed. The concussion against him was so sudden and so utterly unexpected, as well as so tremendously violent, that he was thrown down, and, in his fall, the light was fairly extinguished. All was darkness, save a dull, reddish kind of light that now and then, from the nearly consumed mill in the immediate vicinity, came into the room. But by that light, dim, uncertain, and flickering as it was, some one was seen to make for the window. He ran down the staircase, and presently returned with a small, but powerful, iron crow-bar. \" This will do,\" he said. \" It will, it will. Give it to me.\" \" Has she not spoken ?\" \" Not a word. My mind misgives me that something very dreadful must have happened to her.\" \"And that odd noise ?\" Henry, although nearly stunned by his fall, saw a figure, gigantic in height, which nearly reached from the floor to the ceil ing. The other young man, George, saw it, and Mr. Marchdale likewise sa-v it, as did the lady who had spoken to the two \" Still goes on. Somehow, it curdles thc very blood in my veins to hear it.\" The man took the crow-bar, and with some difficulty succeeded in introducing it between the door and the side of the wall \u25a0still it required great strength to move"], [14, "VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE; OR, 6 from the natural formation of the coun. tenahce, the lips receded much from the large canine-looking teeth. A strango howling noise came from the throat of this monstrous figure, and it seemed upon the point of rushing upon Mr. Marchdale. Suddenly, then, as if some impulse had seized upon it, it uttered a wild and terrible shrieking kind of laugh ; and then turning, dashed through the window, and in one instant dis appeared from before the eyes of those who felt nearly annihilated by its fearful presence. \" God help us !\" ejaculated Henry. young men in tbe corridor when first the screams of the young girl awakened alarm in the breasts of all the inhabitants of that house. The figure was about to pass out at the window which led to a kind of balcony, from whence there was an easy descent to a garden. Before it passed out, they each and all caught a glimpse of the side- face, and they saw that the lower part of it and the lips were dabbled in blood. They saw, too, one of those fearful-looking, shining, me tallic eyes, which presented so terrible an appearance of unearthly ferocity. No wonder that, for a moment, a panic seized them all, which paralysed any exer tions they might otherwise have made to detain that hideous form. But Mr. Marchdale was a man of ma ture years ; he had seen much of life, both in this and in foreign land3 ; and he, although astonished to the extent of being frightened, was much more likely to re cover sooner than his younger companions, which, indeed, he did, and acted promptly enough. Mr. Marchdale drew a long breath, and then, giving a stamp on the floor, aa if to recover himself from the stAte of agita tion into which even he was thrown, he cried \u2014 \u2022 \" Be it what or who it may, I'll follow it.\" \" No \u2014 no\u2014 do not,\" cried the lady. \" I must \u2014 I will. Let who will come with me, I follow that dreadful form.\" As he spoke, he took the road it took, and dashed through the window into the balcony. \" And we, too, George,\" exclaimed Henry; \"we will follow Mr. Marchdale. This dreadful affair concerns us more nearly than it does him.\" \" Don't rise, Henry,\" he cried. \" Lie still.\" Almost at the moment he uttered these words, he fired at the figure, which then occupied the window, as if it were a gigan tic figure set in a frame. The report was tremendous in that chamber, for the pistol was no toy weapon, but one made for actual service, and of sufficient length and bore of barrel to carry destruction along with the bullets that came from it. The lady, who was the mother of these young men, and of the beautiful girl who had been so awfully visited, screamed aloud and implored of them to stay. But tbe voice of Mr. Marchdale was heard ex claiming aloud \u2014 \" I see it\u2014 I see it ; it makes for the wall.\" \" If that has missed its aim,\" said Mr. Marchdale, \" I'll never pull a trigger again.\" As he spoke, he dashed forward, and made a clutch at the figure he thought he had shot. They hesitated no longer, but at once rushed into the balcony, and from thence dropped into the garden. The mother approached the bed-side of the insensible, perhaps the murdered girl ; she saw her, to all appearance, weltering in blood, and, overcome by her emotions, she fainted on the floor of the room. The tall form turned upon bim, and when he got a full view of the face, which he did at that moment, from the opportune circumstance of the lady returning at the instant with a light she had been to her own chamber to procure, even he, March dale, with all his courage, and that was great, and all his nervous energy, recoiled a step or two, and uttered the exclamation of, \"Great God!\" That face was one never to be forgotten. It was hideously flushed with colour \u2014 the colour of fresh blood ; the eyes had a savage and remarkable lustre ; whereas, before, they had looked liked polished tin \u2014 they now wore a ten times brighter aspect, and flashes of light seemed to dart from them. The mouth was open, as if, When the two young men reached the garden, they found it much lighter than might have been fairly expected ; for not only was the morning rapidly approaching, but the mill was still burning, and those mingled lights made almost every object plainly visible, except when deep shadows were thrown from some gigantic trees that had stood for centuries in that sweetly wooded spot. They heard the voice of Mr. Marchdale, aa he cried \u2014 \" There \u2014 there \u2014 towards the wall. There \u2014 there \u2014 God ! how it bounds along !\" The joung men hastily dashed through"], [15, "THE -FEAST OF BLOOD. 7 a thicket in the direction from whence the full at the tall form, with a steady aim.

At that point it was full twelve feet in height, and as they looked, they saw the hideous, monstrous form they had traced from the chamber of their sister, making frantic efforts to clear the obstacle.

They trembled\u2014 well indeed they might, and sor some minutes they watched tbe figure making its fruitless efforts to leave the place. \"What\u2014 what is it?\" wbisped Henry, in hoarse accents. \" God, what can it possibly be?\" \" I know not,\" replied Mr. Marchdale, \" I did seize it. It was cold and clammy like a corpse. It cannot be human.\" \"Not human?\" \"It would seem so,\" said Mr. March dale. \" Let us hurry round to the outside of the wall, and see where he lies.\" This was at once agreed to, and the whole three of them made what expedition they could to wards a gate which led into a paddock, across which they hurried, and soon found themselves clear of the garden-wall, so that they could make way towards where they fully expected to find the body of him who had worn so unearthly an aspect, but who it would be an excessive reUef to find was human. \" Look at it now. It will surely escape now.\" \" No, no \u2014 we will not be terrified thus \u2014 \u25a0there is Heaven above us. Come on, and, for dear Flora's sake, let us make an effort yet to seize this bold intruder.\" \"Take this pistol,\" said Marchdale. \" It is the fellow of the one I fired. Try its efficacy.\" \"He will be gone,\" exclaimed Henry, as at this moment, after may repeated at tempts and fearful falls, the figure reached the top of the wall, and then hung by its long arms a moment or two, previous to dragging itself completely up. So hurried was the progress they made, that it was scarcely possible to exchange many words as they went ; a kind of breath less anxiety was upon them, and in their speed they disregarded every obstacle, which would, at any other time, have pro bably prevented them from taking the direct road they sought. It wa9 difficult, on the outside of the wall, to say exactly which was the precise spot which it might be supposed the body* had fallen on; but, by following the wall in its entire length, surely they would come upon it. Tho idea of the appearance, be it what it mi_;lit, entirely escaping, seemed to nerve again Mr. Marchdale, and he, as well as the two young men, ran forward towards the wall. They got so close to the figure before it sprang down on the outer side of the wall, that to miss killing it with the bullet lrom the pistol was a matter of utter impossibility, unless wilfully. Henry had the weapon, and he pointed it They did so ; but, to their surprise, they got from its commencement to its further extremity without finding any dead body, or even any symptoms of one having lain there. At some parts close to the wall there grew a kind of heatb, and, consequently, the traces of blood would be lost among it,"], [16, "8 VARNEY, TIIE-VA1IPYRE. if it so happened that at the precise spot at which the strange being had seemed to topple over, such vegetation had existed. This was to be ascertained ; but now, after traversing the whole length of the wall twice, they came to a halt, and looked wonderingly in each other's faces. \" There is nothing here,\" said Henry. \" Nothing,'' added his brother. \" It could not have been a delusion,\" at length said Mr. Marchdale with a shudder. \"Speak at once, Martha,\" said Ilenrv. \"Is Flora living?\" \"Yes; but \" \" Enough\u2014 enough ! Thank God she lives; where is she now?\" \" In her own room, Master Henry. Oh, dear \u2014 oh, dear, what will becomo of us all?\" Henry rushed up the staircase, followed by George and Mr. Marchdale, nor paused he once until he reached the room of his sister. \" A delusion !\" exclaimed the brothers. '\u25a0 That is not possible; we all saw it.\" \"Then what terrible explanation can we give?\" \"By heavens! I know not,\" exclaimed Henry. \"This adventure surpasses all belief, and, but for the great interest we have in it, I should regard it with a world of curiosity.\" \" It is too dreadful.\" said George; \" for God's sake, Henry, let us return to ascer tain if poor Flora is killed.\" \" My senses,\" said Henry, \" were all so much absorbed in gazing at that horrible form, that I never once looked towards her \"Mother,\" he said, before he crossed tha threshold, \"are you here?\" \" I am my dear \u2014 I am. Come in, pray come in, and apeak to poor Flora.\" \" Come in, Mr. Marchdale,\" said Henry \u2014 \" come in ; wo make no stranger of you.\" They all then entered the room. Several lights bad been now brought into the antique chamber, and, in addilion to the mother of the beautiful girl who had been so fearfully visited, tkere were two fe- male domestics, who appeareei to be in tha greatest possible fright, for they could ren- der no assistance whatever to anybody. The tears were streaming down the mo ther's face, and the moment she saw Mr. Marchdale, she clung to his arm, evidently unconscious of what she was about, and exclaimed \u2014 further than to see that she was, to all ap pearance, dead. God help her ! poor \u2014 poor, beautiful Flora. This is, indeed, a sad, sad fate for you to come to. Flora \u2014Flora \" \"Do not weep, Henry,\" said George. \" Rather let us now hasten home, where we mayfind that tears are premature. She may yet he living and restored to us.\" \"And,\" said Mr. Marchdale, \"she may ba able to give us some account of this dreadful visitation.\" \" Ob, what is this that has happened, what is this? Tell me, Marchdale!\" Ro- I bert Marchdale, you whom 1 have known even from my childhood, you will not de ceive me. Tell me the meaning of all this?\" \" I cannot,\" lie said, in a tone of much emotion. \"A, God is my judge, I am as much puzzled and amazed at the scene that has taken place here to-night as you can be.\" \"True \u2014 true,\" exclaimed Henry; \"we will hasten home.\" They now turned their steps homewards, ! and as they went they much blamed thcm- : selves for all leaving home together, and with terror pictured what might occur in I their absence to thesa who were now totally 1 unprotected. ' \" It was a rath impulse of us all to come- in pursuit of this dreadful figure,\" re- marked Mr. Marchdale; \" but do not tor , ment yourself, Henry. There may be no reason for your fears.\" I At the pace they went, they very soon reached the ancient house, and when thev came in sight if it, they saw lights Bashing from the window?, and the shadows or form moving to and fro, indicating thai tie whole household was up, and in a state of alarm. Henry, after sc-me trouble, got the hall- 1 door opened by a terrifico. servant, who j was trembling so much that she could 1 1 scarcely hold the light she had with her. _ ' -.- . The mo' her wrung her hands and wept. \"It was thc storm that first awakened me,\" added Marchdale; \" and then I heard a iCBCam.\" The brothers tremblingly approached the bed. Flora was pla* ed in a sitting, half reclining posture, propped up by pillows. She was quite insensible, and her face was fearfully pale ; while that she breathed at all coubi be but very saintly seen. On some of her clothing, about the neck, were spots of blood, ami she lo ke.1 more like one who had suffered some kng and grievous ill ness, than a young girl in the prime of life, and in rhe nwst robust health, as she had Icon on the day previous to tbe strange scene we have recorded. \" Does s'ie sleep?\" snid Henry, as a tear fell Irom his eyes upon her pallid cheek. \" No,\" reptied Air.

Then she sudderal, and burst into tears as she said \u2014 Active measures were now adopted to restore the languid circulation, and, after persevering in them for some time, they had the satisfaction of seeing her open her eyes. \"Oh, Heaven, have mercy upon me \u2014 Heaven, have mercy upon me, and save mo from that dreadful form.\" Her first act upon consciousness return ing, however, wts to utter a loud shriek, and it was not until Henry implored her to look around her, and see that she was sur rounded by none but friendly faces, that sbe \" There is no one here, Flora,\" said Mr. Marchdale ; \" but those who love you, and who, in defence of you, if needs be, would lay down their lives.\" \"Ob, God!

There could be no doubt but the stimulating effect of the wine was beneficial, for a slight .cces- sior. of colour visited her cheeks, and she in a firmer tone, as she saiti \u2014 '\u25a0 Lo not kave me.

I think I screamed, but I could not fly. Oh, God ! I could not fly. It came\u2014 it seized me by tbe hair. I know no more, I know no more.\" She passed her hand across her neck several times, and Mr. Marchdale said, in an anxious voice \u2014 \" I understand,\" said Henry. \" Let her sleep.\" There was a silence of some few minutes' duration. Flora had dropped into a deep slumber. That silence was first brokeu by George, who said \u2014 \"Mr Marchdale, look at that por trait.\" '\u2022 You seem, Flora, to have hurt your neck \u2014 there is a wound.\" \" A wound !\" said the mother, aud she brought a light close to the bed, where all saw on tho side ot Flora's neck a small punctured wound ; or, rather two, for there was one a little distance from the other. He pointed to the portrait in the frame to which we have alluded, and the moment Marchdale looked at it he sunk into a chair as he exclaimed \u2014 \" Gracious Heaven, how like !\" \"It is\u2014 it is,\" said Henry. \"Those eyea \" \"And see the contour of the countenance, and the strange shape of the mouth.\" \" Exact \u2014 exact.\" It was from these wounds the blood had come which was observable upon ber night clothing. \" How came these wounds ?\" said Henry. \" That picture shall be moved from here. The sight of it is at once sufficient to awaken all her former terrorsin poor Flora's brain if sbe should chance to awaken and cast her eyes suddenly upon it.\" \" I do not know,\" she replied. \" I feel very faint and weak, as if I had almost bled to death.\" \" And is it so like him who came here?\" said the mother. \" You cannot have done ao, dear Flora, sor there are not ab^ve half-a-dozen spots of blood to be seen at alL\" \" It is the very man himself,\" said Mr. Marchdale. \" I have not been in this house long enough to ask any of you whose portrait that maybe?\" Mr. Marchdale leaned against the carved head of the bed for support, and he ut tered a deep groan. All eyes were turned upon him, and Henry said, in a voice of the most anxious inquiry \u2014 \" You have something to say, Mr. Marchdale, which will throw some light upon this affair.\" \" No, no, no, nothing !\" cried Mr. Marchdale, rousing himself at once from the appearance of depression that had come over him. \"I have nothing to say, but tbat I think Flora had better get some sleep if sbe can.\" \" No sleep\u2014 no sleep for me,\" again screamed Flora. \"Dare I be alone to sleep?\" \"It is,\" said Henry, \" the portrait of Sir Runnagate Bannerworth, an ancestor of ours, wno first, by his vices, gave the great blow to the family prosperity.\" \" Indeed. How long ago?\" \"About ninety years.\" \"Ninety years. 'Tis a long while \u2014 ninety years.\" \" You muae upon it.\" \"No, no.

Not now \" But you Bhall not be alone, dear Flora,\" said Henry. \" I will sit by your bedside and watch you.\" She took his hand in both hers, and while the tears coursed each other down her cheeks, she said \u2014 -not now.\" \" The daylight is coming quickly on,\" said Henry. \" I shall keep my sacred pro mise of not moving from this room until Flora awakens ; but there can be no oc casion for the detention of any of you.

We can account for this phenomenon in no other way. Perhaps never in his life had he, Henry Bannerworth, felt so strongly this transition of fe-ling as he now felt it, when tbe beautiful daylight gradually dawned upon him, as he kept his lonely watch by the bedside of his slumbering sister. \" I will fetch you my powder-flask and bullets,\" said Mr. Marchdale ; \" and you can, if you please, reload the pistols. In about two hours more it will be broad day light.\" This arrangement was adopted. Henry did reload the pistols, and placed them on a table by tbe side of the bed, ready for immediate action, and then, as Flora was sleeping soundly, all left the room but himself. That watch had been a perfectly undis turbed one. Not the least sight or sound of any intrusion had reached his senses. All had been as still as the very grave. And yet, while the night lasted, and he was more indebted to the rays of the candle, whicb he had placed upou a shelf, for the power to distinguiah objects than to the light of the morning, a thousand uneasy and strange sensations had found a home in his agitated bosom. He looked so many times at the portrait which was in the panel, that at length he felt an undefined sensation of terror creep over him whenever he took his eyes off it. He tried to keep himself from looking at it, but he found it vain, so he adopted what, perhaps, was certainly the wisest, best plan, namely, to look at it continually. He shifted his chair so that he could gaze upon it without any effort, and he placed the candle so that a faint light was thrown upon it, and there he sat, a prey to many conflicting aud uncomfortable feelings, until the daylight began to make the candle flame look dull and sickly. Mrs. Bannerworth was thc last to do so. She would have remained, but for the earnest solicitation of Henry, ihat she would endeavour to get some sleep to make up for her broken night's repose, and she was indeed so broken down by her alarm on Flora's account, that she had not power to resist, but with tears flowing from her eyes, she sought her own chamber. And now the calmness of the night re sumed its sway in that evil-fated mansion ; and although no one really slept but Flora, all were still. Busy thought kept every one else wakeful. It was a mockery to lie down at all, and Henry, full of strange and painful feelings as he was, preferred his present position to the anxiety and appre hension on Flora's account which he knew he should feel if she were not within the sphere of his own observation, and she slept as soundly as some gentle infant tired of its playmates and its sports. Solution for the events of the night he could find none. He racked his imagina tion in vain to find some means, however vague, of endeavouring to account for what had occurred, and still he was at fault. All was to him wrapped iu tbe gloom of the most profound mystery. CHAPTER IV.

It was wonderfully well executed, that portrait ; so life-like, that the very features seemed to move as you gazed upon them. \" It shall be removed,\" said Henry. \" I would remove it now, but that it seems absolutely painted on the panel, and I should awake Flora in any attempt to do so.\" gination, and olteu render the judgment almost incapable of action, when the heavy shadow of night is upon all things.

T\"E VAMPYRE ; 0\"., \"True,\" he said, \"I might now destroy it, but it is a pity to obsesrc a work of \u25a0uc'i rare art as this ia ; I should blame myself if I were. It shall be removed to some other room of the house, however.\" Then, all of a sudden, it struck Henry how foolish it would be to remove the portrait from the wall of a room which, in all likelihood, after that night, would be uninhabited ; for it was not probable that Flora would choose again to inhabit a chamber in which she had gone through so much terror. which was, as h\u00ab knew, occupied by Mr. Marchdale; and, as he crossed thc corridor, he could not but pause a moment to glance from a window at the face of nature. As is ofren the case, the terrific storm of tbe preceding evening had cleared the air, and rendered it deliciously invigora ting and life-like. The weather had been dull, and there bad been for some days a certain heaviness in the atmosphere, which was now entirely removed. The morning sun was shining with un common brilliancy; birda were singing in every tree and on every bush; so pleasant, so spirit-stirring, health-giving a morning, seldom had ho seen. And the effect upon his spirits wa3 great, although not altoge ther what it might have been, had all gone on as it was usually in the habit of doing at that house. Tho ordinary little casual ties of evil fortune had certainly, from time to time, in the shape of illness, and one thing or another, attacked tho family of the Bannerworths in common with every other family, but here suddenly had arisen a something at once terrible and inexpli cable. \" It can be left where it i3,\" he said, \" and we can fasten up, if we please, even the very door of this room, so that no one need trouble themselves any further about it.\" The morning was now coming fast, and just as Henry thought he would partially draw a blind across the window, in order to shield from the direct rays of the sun the eyes of Flora, she awoke. \"Help\u2014 help!\" she cried, and Henry was by her side in a moment. \"You are safe, Flora\u2014 you are safe,\" he said. \" Where is it now?\" she said. \"What\u2014 what, dear Flora?\" \"The dreadful apparition. Oh, what have I done to be made thus perpetually miserable?\" \" He found Mr. Marchdale up and dressed, and apparently in deep and anxious thought. Tbe moment he saw Henry, he said \u2014 \"Think no more of it, Flora.'' \" I must think. My brain ia on fire! A million of strange eyes seem gazing on me.\" \" Great Heaven ! she raves,\" said Henry. \"Hark \u2014 hark \u2014 hark! He comes on the wings of the storm. Oh, it is most horrible \u2014 horrible !\" \" Flora is awake, I presume.\" \" Y'os, but her mind appears to be much disturbed.\" \" From bodily weakness, I dare say.\" \"But why should she be bodily weak? She was strong and well \u2014ay, as well as she could ever be in all her life. The glow of youth and health was on her cheeks. Is it possible that, in the course of one night, she should become bodily weak to snch an extent?\" Henry rang the bell, but not sufficiently loud to create any alarm. The sound reached the waking ear of the mother. who in a few moments was in the room. \"Henry,\" said Mr. Marchdale, sadly, \" sit down. I am not, as you know, a superstitious man.\" \" You certainly are not.\" \" And yet I never in all my life was so absolutely staggeicd as I have been by the occurrences of to-nigh:.\" \" Say on.\" \" There is a frightful, a hideous solution of them ; one which every consideration will tend to add strength to, one which I tremble to name now, although, yesterday, at tbis hour, I should have laughed it to scorn,\" \" She has awakened,\" said Henry, \"and has spoken, but she seems to me to wander in her discourse.

Tell no one that which I am about to say to you.

Having ascer tained, then, that they were quite alone, he returned, and drawing a chair close to that on which Henry sat, be said \u2014 \"Henry, have you never heard of a strange and dreadful superstition whicb, in some countries, is extremely rife, by which it is supposed that there are beings who never die?\" \" Nor I\u2014 nor I.

God of Heaven ! let me hear it.\" \"A vampyre!\" Henry sprung to his feet. His whole frame quivered with emotion ; the cirops of perspiration stood upon his brow, as, in a strange, hoarse voice, he repeated tbe words \u2014 \" A vampyre !\" \"Even so; onewhohas to renew a dread ful existence by human blood \u2014 one who lives on for ever, and mnst keep up such a fearlul existence npon human gore \u2014 one who eats not and drinks not as other men \u2014 a vampyre !\" \"Peace, oh ! peace.

Henry dropped into his seat, and ut tered a deep groan of tbe most exquisite anguish. '\u2022 I could echo that groan,\" said March dale, \"but that I am so thoroughly bewil dered I know not what to think.\" \" Good God\u2014 good God !\" \"Do not too readily yield belief in so d ea Iful a s lpposition, I pray you.\" '* Yield belief!\" exclaimed Henry, as he rose, and lifted up one of his hands above his head. \"No ; by Heaven, and the great God of al), who there rules, I will not easily believe aught so awful aud so mon strous!

I hear a step.\" There was a tap at the door at this mo ment, and George made his appearance in answer to the summons to come in. He looked pale and ill ; his face betrayed how much he had mentally suffered during that night, and almost directly he got into the bed-chamber he said \u2014 \" I shall, I am sure, be censured by you both for what I am going to say; but I cannot help saying it, nevertheless, for to keep it to myself would destroy me.\" \" Good God, George ! what is it?\" said Mr. Marehdale. \" Speak it out !\" said Henry. \"I have been thinking of what has oc curred here, and the result of that thought has been one of the wildest suppositions that ever I thought I should have to enter tain.

'' I say a vampyre,\" added George, with much excitement in his manner. \" It is a fearful, a horrible supposition ; but our poor, dear Flora has been visited by a vampyre, and I shall go completely mad !\" He sat down, and covering his face with his hands, he wept bitterly and abun dantly. \" George,\" said Henry, when he saw thit ihe frantic grief had in some measure \u25a0, h. ted\u2014\" be calm, George, and endeavour en to me.\" \" I lvar, HeEry.\" 'Well, then, do not suppose that you . only one in this house to whom so elr'adful a supposition has occurred.\" ' \"Not the only one?\" , \"No ; it has occurred to Mr. Marehdale \u00bb.lso.\""], [23, "THE FEAST OP BLOOD. 15 upon, under a promise of secrecy, making a confidant of ; but, long before he reached him, he found he might well dispense with the promise of secrecy. He had never thought, so engaged had he been with other matters, that the ser vants were cognizant of the whole affair, and that from them he had no expectation of being able to keep the whole story in all its details. Of course, such an opportunity for tale-bearing and gossiping was not likely to be lost ; and while Henry was thinking over how he bad better act in the matter, the news that Flora Bannerworth had been visited in the night by a vampyre \u2014 for the servants named the visitation such at once \u2014 was spreading all over the county. As he rode along, Henry met a gentle man on horseback who belonged to the county, and who, reining in his steed, said to him \u2014 \" Good-morning, Mr. Bannerworth.\" \" Good-morning,\" responded Henry, and he would have ridden on, but the gentle man added \u2014 \"Excuse me for interrupting you, sir ; but what is the strange story that is in everybody's mouth about a vampyre?\" Henry nearly fell off his horse, he was so much astonished, and, wheeling the animal round, he said \u2014 \"In everybody's mouth !\" \"Yes ; I have heard it from at least a dozen persons.\" \" You surprise me.\" \" Is it untrue ? Of course, I am not so absurd as really to believe about the vam pyre; but is there no foundation at all for it?

Several attempts were made to stop him, but he only waved his hand and trotted on, nor did he pause in his speed till he reached the door of Mr. Chilling worth, the medical man whom he intended to consult. Henry knew that at such a time he would be at home, which was the case, and he was soon closeted with the man of drugs. Henry begged his patient hearing, which being accorded, he related to him at full length what had happ ;.,ed, not omitting, to the best of his remembrance, any one particular. When he had concluded his narration, the doctor shifted his position several times, and then said \u2014 \"That's all?\" - \" Yes \u2014 and enough, too.\" \" More than enough, I should say, my young friend.

For full ; two minutes Mr. Chillingworth attentively examined the two small wounds in the ! r.eck of Flora. He took a powerful mag nifying glass firom his pocket, and looked at them through it, and after his examina tion was concluded, he said \u2014 \"They are very trifling wounds, in deed.\" \"But how inflicted?\" said Henry. \" By some insect, I should say, which probably \u2014 it being the season for many insects \u2014 has flown in at the window.\" \"I knew the motive,\" said Flora, \"which prompts all these suggestions ; it is a kind one, and I ought to be tbe last to quarrel with it ; but what I have seen, nothing can make me believe I saw not, unless I am, as once or twice I have thonght myself, really mad.\" \" How do you now feel in general health r\" _ \" Far from well ; and a strange drow siness at times creeps over me.

Mr. Chillingworth beckoned Henry to come with him from the room, but the latter had promised that he wonld remain with Flora ; and as Mrs. Bannerworth had left the chamber because she was unable to \\ control her feelings, he rang the bell, and requested that his mother would come. She did so, and then Henry went down stairs along with the medical man, whose opinion he waa certainly eager to be now made acquainted with. As soon as they were alone in an old- fashioned room which was called the oak closet, Henry turned to Mr. Chillingworth, and said \u2014 ''What, now, is your candid opinion, sir i You have seen my sister, and those strange indubitable evidences of somethin-*' wrong.\" \" Oh, that I could believe the former supposition, but I am confident she has taken no narcotic ; she conld not even do so by mistake, sor there is no drug of the sort in the house.

I shall see you to-morrow morning.\" Mr. Chillingworth appeared now to be anxious to go, and Henry no longer op posed his departure ; but when he was gone a sense of great loneliness came over him. \"To night,\" he repeated, \"is the full of the moon.

There was a note at the bottom of one of the pages at this part of the book, and Henry read as follows : \u2014 \" Well, well, we must leavo the matter at present as it stands. Time may accom plish something towards its development ; but at present so palpable a mystery I never came across, or a matter in which human calculation was so completely soiled.\" \"Nor I\u2014 nor I.\" \" I will sond you some medicines, such as I think will be of service to Flora, and depend upon seeing me by ten o'clock to morrow morning.\" \" You have, of course, heard something,\" said Henry to the doctor, as he was pulling on his glovas, \"about vampyres.\" \" I certainly have, and I understand that in some countries, particularly Nor way and Sweden, the superstition is a very common one.\" \" With regard to these vampyres, it is believed by those who are inclined to give credence to so dreadful a superstition, that they always endeavour to make their feast of blood, for the revival of their bodily powers, on some evening immediately pre ceding a full moon, because if any accident befal them, such as being shot, or otherwise killed or wounded, they can recover by lying down somewhere where the full moon's rays will fall upon them.\" Henry let the book drop from his hands with a groan and a shudder. \"And in tho Levant.\" \" Yes.

I need not ask upon what sub ject,\" said George, sadly. \" I sought you to bring you this letter.\" \" A letter to me ?\" \" Yes, you see it is addressed to you, and the seal looks as if it came from some one of consequence.\" \" I would advi-ie you not, George ; your health, you know, is very far from good.\" \"Nay, allow me. If not, then the anx iety I shall suffer will do me more barm than the watchfulness I shall keep up in her chamber.\" This was an argument which Henry felt himself the force of too strongly not to ad mit it in the case of George, and he there fore made no further opposition to his wish to make one in the night watch. \u25a0' There will be an advantage,\" said George, \" you see,, in three of us bein? engaged in this matter, because, should anything occur, two can act together, and yet Flora may not be left alone.\" \" True, true, that is a great advantage.\" Now a soft, gentle, silvery light began to spread itself over tbe heavens. The moon was rising, and as the beneficial effects of the storm ofthe preceding evening were 6tiil felt in the clearness of the air, the rays appeared to be more lustrous and full of beauty than they commonly were. *\" Indeed !\" 1 \" Yes, Henry. Read it, and see from whence it comes.\" There was just sufficient light by going to the window to enable Henry to read the letter, wbich he did aloud. It ran thus:\u2014 \" Sir Francis Varney presents his com pliments to Mr. Bannerworth, and is much concerned to hear that some domestic afliiction has fallen upon him. Sir Francis hopes that.the genuine and loving sympa thy of a'neighbour will not be regarded as an intrusion, and begs to proffer any as sistance or counsel that may be within the compass of his means. Each moment the night grew lighter, and by the time the brothers were ready to take their places in tho chamber of Flora, the moon had risen considerably. \" Ratlord Abbey.\" \" Sir Francis Vamey !\" said Henry ; \"who is he?\" Although neither Henry nor George had any objection to the company of Mr. March dale, yet they gave him the option, and rather in fact urged him not to destroy his night's repose by sitting up with them ; but he said \u2014 \" Do you not remember, Henry,\" said George, \" we were told a few days ago, that a geptleman of that name had become the purchaser of thc estate of Ratford Abbey?\" \"Ob, yes, yes. Have you seen him?\" \" I have not.\" \"Allow me to do so ; I am older, and have calmer judgment than you can have Should anything again appear, I am quite resolved that it shall not escape me.\" \" What would you do?\" \" With the name of God upon my lips,\" said Mr. Marchdale, solemnly, \" I would grapple with it.\" \"Y'ou laid hands upon it last night.\" \"I did, and have forgotten to show you what I tore from it.

I am far from wishing to keep up in any one's mind proofs of that which I would fain, very fain refute.\" Mr. Marchdale replaced the portion of the coat which the figure had worn in his pocket, and then the whole three proceeded to the chamber of Flora. * * * * * * It was within a very few minutes of midnight, the moon had climbed high in the heavens, and a night of such brightness and beauty had seldom shown itself for a long period of time. Flora slept, and in her chamber sat the two brothers and Mr. Marchdale, silently, for she had shown symptoms of restlessness, and they much feared to break the light slumber into which she had fallen. Occasionally they had conversed in whispers, which could not have the effect of rousing her, for the room, although smaller than the one she had before occupied, was still sufficiently spacious to enable them to get some distance from the bed. Until the hour of midnight now actually struck, they were silent, and whenthelast echo of the sounds had died away, a feel ing of uneasiness came over them, which prompted some conversation to get rid of it. There was no light needed, for the moon stood suspended in a cloudless sky, so that from the house being a detached one, and containing numerous windows, it was as light as day. Although the distance from one chamber to the other was only across the corridor, it was a greater space than these words might occupy, for the corridor was wide, neither was it directly across, but considerably slanting. However, it was oertainly suffi ciently close at hand for any sound of alarm from one chamber to reach another without any difficulty. \" How bright the moon is now,\" said Hijnry, in a low tone. \" I never saw it brighter,\" replied Marchdale. \" I feel as if I were assured that we shall not to-night be interrupted.\" \" It was later than this,\" said Henry. \" It was \u2014 it was.\" \" Do not then yet congratulate us upon no visit.\" \" How still the house is !\" remarked George; \" it seems tome as if I had never sound it so intensely quiet before.\" \"It is very still.\" \" Hush ! she moves.\" A few moments sufficed to place Henry and Mr. Marchdale in that antique room, where, from the effect of the moonlight, which was streaming over it, the portrait on the panel looked exceedingly life-like. And this effect was probably the greater because the rest of the room was not illumi nated by the moon's rays, which came through a window in the corridor, and then at tbe open door of that chamber upon the porWait. Mr. Marchdale held the piece of cloth hi Flora moaned in her sleep, and made a slight movement. The curtains were all drawn closely round the bed to shield her eyes from the bright moonlight which streamed into the room so brilliantly.

Remain here while I fetch a sword from my own room.\" Henry did so, and when George re turned with a sword, which he always kept in his bed-room, he said \u2014 \" Now go, Henry. I prefer a weapon of this description to pistols much. Do not be longer gone than necessary.\" \" I will not, George, be assured.\" George was then lest alone, and Henry returned to the balcony, where Mr. March dale was waiting for him. It was a quicker mode of descending to the garden to do so by clambering over the balcony than any other, and the height was not considerable enough to make it very objectionable, so Henry and Mr. Marchdale chose than way of joining Mr. Chillingworth. \" You are, no doubt, much surprised at finding me here,\" said the doctor; \"but tbe fact is, I half made up my mind to come while I was here; but I had not thoroughly done so, therefore I said nothing to you about it.\" A sickening sensation came over Henry, and he was compelled to lean against the wall for support, as in scarcely articulate accents he said \u2014 \"The vampyre \u2014 the vampyre! God of Heaven, it has come again!\" \"Now, Heaven, inspire us with more than mortal courage,\" cried Mr. March dale, and he dashed open the window at once, and sprang into the balcony. Henry in a moment recovered himself sufficiently to follow him, and when he reached his side in the balcony, Marehdale said, as he pointed below \u2014 \" There is some one concealed there.\" \"Where\u2014 where?\"* ~ \" Among the laurels. I will fire a ran dom shot, and we may do some execution.\" \" Hold !\" said a voice from below, \" don't do any such thing, I beg of you.\" \"Why, that is Mr. Chillingworth's voice,\" cried Henry. \" Yes, and it's Mr. Chillingworth's per son, too,\" said the doctor, as he emerged from among some laurel bushes. \" How is this?\" said Marehdale. \" Simply that I made up iry mind to keep watch and ward to-night outside here, in the hope of catching the vampyre. I got into here by climbing the gate.\" \"But why did you not let me know?\" said Henry. \" Because I did not know myself, my young friend, till an hour and a half ago.\" \" We are much indebted to you,\" said Henry, \"for making the attempt.\" \" I am prompted to it by a feeling of the greatest curiosity.\" \" Are you armed, sir?\" said Marchdale. \"In this stick,\" said the doctor, \"isa sword, the exquisite temper of which I know I can depend upon, and I fully in tended to run through any one whom I saw that looked in the least of the vampyre i order.\" * You would have done quite right,\" re plied Mr. Marchdale. \" I have a brace of pistols here, loaded with ball; will you take one Henry, if you please, and then we shall be all armed.\" Thus, then, prepared for any exigency, they made the whole round of the house; bnt found all the fastenings secure, and everything as quiet as possible. \" Suppose, now, we take a survey of the"], [31, "THE FEAST OF BLOOD. 21 park outside the garden-wall,\" said Mr. Marchdale. \" There is a young lime tree yonder t\u00b0 the right.\" \" Yes \u2014yes.\" \" Carry your eye from it in a horizontal line, as near as you can, towards the wood.'' This was agreed to; and before they had proceeded far, Ms. Marchdale said \u2014 \" There is a ladder lying near the wall ; would it not be a good plan to place it | against the very spot the supposed vampyre jumped over last night, and so, from a more 1 1 elevated position, take a view of the open ! meadows?

Henry did so, and then he uttered a sudden exclamation of surprise, and pointed to a rising spot of ground, which was yet, in consequence of the number of tall trees in its vicinity, partially enveloped in shadow. \" What is that?\" he said. \" I see something,\" said Marchdale. \" By Heaven ! it is a human form lying stretched there.\" \" It is\u2014 as if in death.\" \" What can it be ?\" said Chillingworth. \" I dread to say,\" replied Marchdale ; \" but to my eyes, even at this distance, it seems like the form of him we chased last night.\" They made haste down the long vista of I trees until they reached the exact spot, and * then they placed the ladder, as near as pos- sible, exactly where Henry, in his bewilder- ment on the evening before, had seen the apparition from the grave spring to. \" We can ascend singly,\" said March- dale; \" but there ia ample space for us all to sit on the top of the wall and make our observations.\" \" The vampyre ?\" \"Yes \u2014 yes. Look, the moonbeams touch him. Now the shadows of the trees gradually recede. God of Heaven! the figure moves.\" Henry's eyes were rivetted to that fear ful object, and now a scene presented itself which filled them all with wonder and astonishment, mingled with sensations of the greatest awe and alarm. This was seen to be the case, and in about a conple of minutes they had taken up their positions on the wall, and, although the height was but trifling, they found that they had a much more extensive view than they could have obtained by any other As the moonbeams, in consequence of the luminary rising higher and higher in the heavens, came to touch this figure that lay extended on the rising ground, a per ceptible movement took place in it. The limbs appeared to tremble, and although it did not rise up, the whole body gave signs of vitality. means. \"To contemplate the beauty of such a \u2022 night as this,\" said Mr. ChiUingworth, \" is ] amply sufficient compensation for coming I the distance I have.\" \"The vampyre\u2014 the vampyre!\" said Mr. Marchdale. \" I cannot doubt it now. We must have hit him last night with the pistol bullets, and the moonbeams are now restoring him to a new life.\" j | \" And who knows,\" remarked March- dale, \" we may yet see something which may throw a light upon our present per- plexities? God knows that 1 would give all I can call mine in the world to relieve you and your sister, Henry Bannerworth, from the fearful effect which last night's proceedings cannot fail to have upon you.\" \" Of that I am well assured, Mr. March- dale,\" said Henry. \"If the happiness of myself and family depended upon you, we should be happy indeed.\" \"You are sdent, Mr. Chillingworth,\" remarked Marchdale, after a slight pause. \"Hush!\" said Mr. Chillingworth\u2014 ;, \"Hush-hush!\" \" Good God! what do you hear?\" cried Henry. The doctor laid his hand upon Henry's arm as he said\u2014 Henry shuddered, and even Mr. Chil lingworth turned pale. But he was the first to recover himself sufficiently to propose some course of action, and he said \u2014 \"Let us descend and go up to this figure. It is a duty we owe to ourselves as much as to society.\" \"Hold a moment,\" said Mr. Marchdale, as he produced a pistol \" I am an un erring shot, as you well know, Henry. Before we move from this position we now occupy, allow me to try what virtue may be in a bullet to lay that figure low again.\" \" He is rising !\" exd-vmed Henry. Mr. Marchdale levelled the pistol\u2014 he took a sure and deliberate aim, and then, just as the figure seemed to be struggling"], [32, "22 VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE. to its feet, he fired, and, with a sudden bound, it fell again. \" You have hit it,\" said Henry. \" You have indeed,\" exclaimed the doc tor. \" I think we can go now.\" \" Hush !\" said Marchdale \u2014 \" Hush ! Does it not seem to you that, hit it as often as you will, the moonbeams will recover it?\" Chillingworth, \" snch as might have been fashionable a hundred years ago, but not now.\" \" Such was my impression,\" added Marchdale. \"And snch my own,\" said Henry, ex citedly. \"Is it at all within the compass of the wildest belief that what we have 6een is a vampyre, and no other than my ancestor, who, a hundred years ago, com mitted suicide ':\" \"Yes\u2014 yes,\" said Henry, \"they will \u2014 they will.\" \" I can endure this no longer,\" said Mr. Chillingworth, as he sprung from the wall. \"Follow me or not, as you please, I will seek the spot where this being lies.\" \" Oh, be not rash,\" cried Marchdale. \" See, it rises again, and its form looks gigantic.\" \" I trust in Heaven and a righteous cause,\" said the doctor, as he drew the sword he had spoken of from the stick, and threw away the scabbard. \" Come with me if you like, or I go alone.\" Henry at once jumped down from the wall, and then Marchdale followed him, saying, \" Come on ; I will not shrink.\" There was so much intense excitement, and evidence of mental suffering, that Mr. Chillingworth took him by the arm, say ing\u2014 \"Come home\u2014 come home; no more of this at present ; you will but make your self seriously unwell.\" \"No \u2014 no \u2014 no !\" \" Come home, now, I pray you ; you are by far too much excited about this matter to pursue it with thc calmness which should be brought to bear upon it.\" \" Take advice, Henry,\" said Marchdale, \" take advice, and come home at once.\" \" I will yield to you ; I feel that I can not control my own feelings\u2014 I will yield to you, who, as you say, arc cooler on this subject than I can be. Oh, Flora, Flora, I have no comfort to bring to you now!\" They ran towards the piece of rising ground ; but before they got to it, the form rose and made rapidly towards a little wood which was in the immediate neighbourhood of the hillock. \"It is conscious of being pursued,\" cried the doctor. \" See how it glances back, and then increases its speed.\" \" Fire upon it, Henry,\" said Marchdale. He did so ; but either his shot did not take effect, or it was quite unheeded, if it did, by the vampyre, which gained the wood before they could have a hope of getting near it sufficiently to effect, or endeavour to effect, a capture. \" I cannot follow it there,\" said March dale. \"In open country, I would have pursued it closely ; bnt I cannot follow it into the intricacies of a wood.\" Poor Henry Bannerworth appeared to be in a complete state of mental prostra tion, on account of the distressing circum stances that had occurred so rapidly and so suddenly in his family, which had had quite enough to contend with without having snperadded to every other evil the horror of believing that some preternatural agency was at work to destroy every hope of suture happiness in this world, under any circumstances. Ho suffered himself to bo led home by Mr. Chillingworth and Marchdale ; he no longer attempted to dispute the dreadful fact concerning the supposed vampyre ; he could not contend now against all the cor roborating circumstances that seemed to collect together for the purpose of proving that which, even when proved, was con trary to all his notions of Heaven, and at variance with all that was recorded and established as part and parcel ofthe system of nature. \" Pursuit is useless there,\" said Henry. \" it is enveloped in the deepest gloom.\" \" I am not so unreasonable,\" remarked Mr. Chillingworth, \"as to wish you to follow into such a place as that. I am confounded utterly by this affair.\" \"And I,\" said Marchdale. \"What on earth is to be done?\" \" Nothing\u2014 nothing!\" exclaimed Henry, vehemently ; \" and yet I have, beneath the canopy of Heaven, declared that I will, so help me God ! spare neither time nor trouble in the unravelling of- this most fearful piece of business.

The Banner- I worth famUy, then, were well known in the part of the country where they resided. Perhaps, if we were to say they were better known by name than they were liked, on account of that name, wo should be near the truth, for it had unfor tunately happened that for a very consi derable time past the head of the famUy had been the very worst specimen of it that could be procured . While tbe junior branches were frequently amiable and most inteUigcnt, and such in mind and body as were calculated to inspire good wUl iu all who knew them, he who held the famUy property, and who resided in the house now occupied by Flora and her brothers, was a very so-so sort of cha racter. \"Then it could be done?\" asked Mr. Chillingworth. \" Most undoubtedly.\" \"Will you undertake such an adven ture?\" said Mr. ChiUingworth. \"It may ease your mind.\" \" He was buried in the vpalt, and in his clothes,\" said Henry, musingly. \" I will think of it. About such a proposition I would not decide hastUy. Give me leave to think of it untU to-morrow.\" \" Most certainly.\" They now made their way to the cham ber of Flora, and they heard from George that nothing of an alarming character had occurred to disturb him on his lonely watch. The morning was now again dawning, and Henry earnestly entreated Mr. Marchdale to go to bed, which he did, leaving the two brothers to continue as sentinels by Flora's bed-side, untU the morning light should banish aU uneasy thoughts. Henry related to George what had taken place outside the house, and the two brothers held a long and interesting con versation for some hours upon that sub ject, as weU as upon others of great importance to their welfare. It was not untd the sun's early rays came glancing in at the casement that they both rose, and This state of things, by some strange fatality, had gone on for nearly a hundred years, and the consequence was what might havo been fairly expected, namely \u2014 that, what with their vices and what with their extravagancies, the successive heads of the Bannerworth family had succeeded in so far diminishing the famUy property that, when it came into the hands of Henry Banner worth, it was of little value, on account of the numerous incumbrances with which it was saddled. The father of Henry had not been a very briUiant exception to the general rule, as regarded the head of the family. If he were not quite so bad aa many of his an cestors, that gratifying circumstance wag"], [35, "THE FEAST OF BLOOD. 25 to be accounted for hy the supposition that he was not quite so bold, and that the change inhabits, manners, and laws, which had taken place in a hundred years, made it not so easy for even a landed proprietor to play the petty tyrant. He had, to get rid of those animal spirits which had prompted many of his prede cessors to downright crimes, had recourse to the gaming-table, and after raising whatever sums he could upon the property which remained, he naturaUy, and as might have been fully expected, lost them all. He was found lying dead in the garden of the house one day, and by his side was his pocket-book, on one leaf of which, it was the impression of the famUy, he had endeavoured to write something previous to his decease, for he held a pencil firmly in his grasp. The probabUity was that he had felt himself getting UI, and, being desirous of making some communication to his family which pressed heavily upon his mind, he had attempted to do so, bnt was stopped by the too rapid approach of the hand of death. tradiction, as the family lawyer said, rather more facetiously than a man of law usually speaks, for if he had written \" The money is not,\" he would have been some where remarkably near the truth. However, with aU his vices, he was re gretted by his chUdren, who chose rather to remember him in his best aspect than to dweU upon his faults. For the first time, then, within the me mory of man, the head of the famUy of the Bannerworths was a gentleman in every sense of the word. Brave, generous, highly educated, and full of many ex cellent and noble quaUties \u2014 for such was Henry, whom we have introduced to our readers under such distressing circum stances. And now, people said, that the family property having been all dissipated and lost, there would take place a change, and that the Bannerworths would have to take to some course of honourable industry for a livelihood, and that then they would be as much respected as they had before been detested and disliked. Indeed, the position which Henry held was now a most precarious one \u2014 for one of the amazingly clever acts of his father had been to encumber the property with overwhelming claims, so that when Henry administered to the estate, it was doubted almost by his attorney if it were at all de sirable to do so. For some days previous to his decease, his conduct had been extremely myste rious. He had announced an intention of leaving England for ever\u2014 of selUng the house and grounds for whatever they would fetch over and above the sums for which they were mortgaged, and so clear ing himself of all encumbrances. He had, but a lew hours before he was found lying dead, made the foUowing sin gular speech to Henry \u2014 \"Do not regret, Henry, that the old house which has been in our family so long is about to be parted with. Be assured that, if it is but for the first time in my life, I have good and substantial reasons now for what I am about to do. We shall be able to go to some other country, and there five like princes of the land.\" Where the means were to come from to live like a prince, unless Mr. Bannerworth had some of the German princes in his eye, no one knew but himself, and his sudden death buried with him that most important secret. There were some words written on the leaf of his pocket-hook, but they were of by far too indistinct and ambiguous a nature to lead to anything. They were these \u2014 \"The money is \" And then there was a long scrawl of the pencil, which seemed to have been occa sioned by his sudden decease. Of course, nothing could be made of these words, except in the way of a con- An attachment, however, to the old house of his family, had induced the young man to hold possession of it as long as he could, despite any adverse circumstances which might eventually be connected with it. Some weeks, however, only, after the decease of his father, and when he [fairly held possession, a sudden and most unex pected offer came to him from a solicitor in London, of whom he knew nothing, to purchase the house and grounds, for a client of his, who had instructed him so to do, but whom he did not.mention. The offer made was a\" Uberal one, and beyond the value of the place. The lawyer who had conducted Henry's affairs for him since his father's decease, advised him by aU means to take it ; bnt after a consultation with his mother and sister, and George, they aU resolved to hold by their own house as long as they could, and, consequently, he refused the offer. He was then asked to let the place, and name his own price for the occupation of it ; but that he would not do, so the nego ciation went off altogether, leaving only, in the minds of the famUy, much surprise at the exceeding eagerness of some one,"], [36, "26 VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE ; OR, whom they knew not, to get possession of the place on any terms. There was another circumstance, perhaps, which materially aided in producing a strong feeling on the minds of the Banner worths, with regard to remaining where they were. That circumstance occurred thus : Are lation of the famdy, who was now dead, and with whom had died all his means, had been in the habit, for the last half-dozen years of his life, of sending a hundred pounds to Henry, for the express purpose of enabling him and his brother George and his sister Flora, to take a Uttle conti nental or home tour in the autumn of the year. under the circumstances, that an attach ment of the tenderest nature should spring up between him and the beautiful girl, who felt that she owed to him her life. Mutoal glances, of affection were ex changed between them, and it was arranged that when he returned to England, he should come at once as an honoured guest to the house of the family of the Banner worths. All this was settled satisfactorily with the full knowledge and acquiescenoe of the two brothers, who had taken a strango attachment to the young Charles HoUand, who was, indeed, ia every way Ukely to propitiate the good opinion of aU who knew him. A more acceptable present, or for a more delightful purpose, to young people, could not be found ; and, with the quiet, prudent habits of aU three of them, they contrived to go far and to see much for the sum which was thus handsomely placed at their dis posal. In one of those excursions, when among the mountains of Italy, an adventure oc curred which placed the life of Flora in imminent hazard Henry explained to him exactly how they were situated, and told him that when he came he would find awalcome from aU, except possibly his father, whose wayward temper he could not answer for. Young Holland stated that he was com pelled to be away for a term of two years, from certain family arrangments he had entered into, and that then he would return, and hope to meet Flora as unchanged as he should be. They were riding along a narrow moun tain path, and, her horse slipping, she fell over the ledge of a precipice. In an instant a young man, a stranger to the whole party, who was traveUing in the vicinity, rushed to the spot, and, by his courage and exertions, they felt convinced her preservation was effected. He told her to lie quiet ; he encouraged her to hope for immediate succour ; and then, with much personal exertion, and at immense l isk to himself, he reached the ledge of rock on which she lay, and then he supported her until the brothers had gone to a neighbouring house, which, by the-by, was two good EngUsh miles off, aud got assistance. There came on, while they were gone, a terrific storm, and Flora felt that but for him who was with her she must have been hurled from the rock, and perished in an abyss below, which was almost too deep for observation. It happened that this was the last of the continental excursions of the Bannerworths, for, before another year roUed round, the generous relative who had supplied them with the means of making such delightful trips was no more ; and, likewise, the death of the father had occurred in the manner we have related, so that there was no chance, as had been anticipated and hoped for by Flora, of meeting Charles Holland on the continent again, before his two years of absence from England should be expired. Sucb, however, being the state of things, Flora felt reluctant to give up the house, where he would be sure to come to look for her, and her happiness was too dear to Henry to induce him to make any sacrifice of it to expediency. Therefore was it that Bannerworth HaU \u2014 as it was sometimes caUed\u2014 was retained, and fully intended to be re tained, at aU events, untU after Charles Holland had made his appearance, and his advice (for he was, by the young people, considered as one of the family) taken, with regard to what was advisable to be done. Suffice it to say that she was rescued ; and he who had, by his intrepidity, done so much towards saving her, was loaded with the most sincere and heartfelt acknow ledgments by the brothers as well as by herself. With one exception, this was the state of affairs at the hall, and that exception relates to Mr. Marchdale. He frankly told them that his name was HoUand ; that he was travelUng for amuse ment and instruction, and was by profession an artist. He was a distant relation of Mrs. Ban nerworth, and, in early life, had been sin cerely and tenderly attached to her. She, however, with the want of steady reflection He traveUed with them for some time ; and it was not at all to be wondered at,"], [37, "THE FEAST OF BLOOD. 27 i of a young girl, as she then was, had, as is generally the case among several admirers, chosen the very worst \u2022, that is, the man who treated her with the most indifference, and who paid her the least attention, was, of course, thought the most of, and she gave her hand to him. That man was Mr. Bannerworth. But future experience had made her thoroughly awake to her former error ; and, but for the love she bore her children, who were certainly all that a mother's heart could wish, she would often have deeply regrettei the infatuation which had induced her to bestow her hand in the quarter she had done so. About a month after the decease of Mr. Bannerworth, there came one to the hall who desired to see the widow. That one was Mr. Marehdale. It might have been some slight tender- ness towards him which had never left her, or it might be the pleasure merely of seeing one whom she bad known intimately in early life, but, be that as it may, she cer- tainly gave him a kindly welcome ; and he, after consenting to remain for some time as a visitor at the hall, won the esteem of the whole family by his frank demeanour and cultivated intellect. He had travelled much and seen much, and he had turned to good account all he had seen, so that not only was Mr. March- dale a man of sterling sound sense, but he was a most entertaining companion. His intimate knowledge of many things concerning which they knew little or no- thing \u2014 his imodes of thought, and a quiet, gentlemanly demeanour, such as is rarely to be met with, combined to make him esteemed by tho Bannerworths. He had a small independence of his own, and being completely alone in the world, for he had neither wife nor child, Marehdale owned that he felt a pleasure in residing with the Bannerworths. Of course, he could not, in decent terms, so far offend them as to offer to pay for his subsistence, but he took good care that they should really be no losers by having him an inmate, a matter which he could easily arrange by little presents of one kind and another, all of which he managed should be such as were not only ornamental, but actually spared his kind entertainers some positive expense which otherwise they must have gone to. Whether or not this amiable piece of man\u0153uvring was seen through by the Bannerworths, it is not our purpose to in quire. If it was seen through, it could not lower him in their esteem, for it was pro bably just what they themselves would have felt a pleasure in doing under similar cir- ' cumstances, and if they did not observe it, ! Mr. Marehdale would, probably, be all the ' better pleased. j Such, then, may be considered by our j readers as a brief outline of the state of as- fairs among the Bannerworth s. How far the feelings of the family to- wards the ancient house of their race would ' be altered by the appearance at it of so ' fearful a visitor as a vampyre, we will not stop to inquire, inasmuch as such feelings will develop themselves as we proceed. f That the visitation had produced a seri- ous effect upon al! the household was suffi- ' ciently evident, as well among the educated ! as among the ignorant. On the second ' morning, Henry received notice to quit ' his service from the three servants he with difficulty had contrived to keep at the hall. ' The reason why he received such notice he knew well enough, and, therefore, he did I not trouble himself to argue about a super- i stition to which he felt now himself al- most compelled to give way ; for how could he say there was no such thing as a vampyre, when he had, with his own eyes, ' bad the most abundant evidence of the terrible fact? He calmly paid the servants, and allowed them to leave him at once, without at all entering into the matter, and, for the time being, some men were procured, who, however, came evidently with fear and trembling, and probably only took the place on account of their not being able to pro- cure any other. The comfort of the house- ! hold was likely to be completely put an end to, and reasons now for leaving the hall appeared to be most rapidly accumu- lating. CHAPTER VII.

You have now, as you cannot help having, a dis agreeable feeUng that you may find that one coffin is untenanted. Now, if you do find it so, you scarcely make matters worse, by an additional confirmation of what al ready amounts to a strong supposition, and one which is Ukely to grow stronger by time.\" \" True, most true\" \" On the contrary, if you find indubit able proofs that your ancestor has slept soundly in the tomb, and gone the way of all flesh, you wiU find yourselves much calmer, and that an attack is made upon the train of events which at present all run one way.\" \" That is precisely the argument I was using to George,\" said Henry, \"a few moments since.\" \" If you determine, then, upon it,\" said Marchdale, \" we will go to-night ; and, from yonr acquaintance with the place, doubtless you will be able to decide what tools are necessary.\" \" There is a trap-door at the bottom of the pew,\" said Henry ; \"it is not only se cured down, but it is locked Ukewise, and I have the key in my possession.\" \"Indeed !\" \" Then let us go,\" said George, \" by all means.\" \" It is so decided, then,\" said Henry. \" Let it be done with caution,\" replied Mr. Marchdale. \"Yes ; immediately beneath is a short flight of stone steps, which conduct at once into the vault.\" \" If any one can manage it, of course we can.\" \" Is it large ?\" \" No ; about the size of a moderate chamber, and with nointricacies about it.\" \" There can be no difficulties, then?\" \" None whatever, unless we meet with actual personal interruption, which I am inclined to think is very far from likely. AU we shall require will be a screwdriver, with which to remove the screws, and theu something with which to wrench open the coffin.\" \" Those we can easily provide, along with Ughts,\" remarked Mr. Marchdale. \" I hope to Heaven that this visit to the tomb will have the effect of easing your minds, and enabling you to make a success ful stand against the streaming torrent of evidence that has poured in upon us regard ing this most fearful of apparitions.\" \"I do, indeed, hope so,\" added Henry ; \" and now I will go at once to Flora, and endeavour to convince her she is safe with out us to-night.\" \" Why should it not be done secretly and at night? Of course we lose nothing by making a night visit to a vault into which dayUght, I presume, cannot pene trate.\" \" Certainly not.\" \"Then let it be at night.\" \" But we shaU surely require the con currence of some of the church authori ties.\" \" Nay, I do not see that,\" interposed Mr. Marchdale. \" It is the vault actually vested in and belonging to yourself you wish to visit, and, therefore, you have a right to visit it in any manner or at any time that may be most suitable to your self.\" \"But detection in a clandestine visit might produce unpleasant consequences.\" \" The church is old,\" said George, \"and we could easUy find means of getting into it. There is only one objection that I see, just now, and that is, that we leave Flora unprotected.\" \" We do, indeed,\" said Henry. \" I did not think of that.\" \" By-the-by, I think,\" said Marchdale, \" that if we can induce Mr. ChilUngworth to come with us, it will be a great point gained in the investigation.\" \" He would,\" said Henry, \" be able to come to an accurate decision with respect to the remains\u2014 if any\u2014 in the coffin, which we could not.\" \" Then have him, by all means,\" said George. \" He did not seem averse last night to go on such an adventure.\" \" I wiU ask him when he makes his visit \" It must be put to herself as a matter sor her own consideration,\" said Mr. Marchdale, \"if she will consider herself sufficiently safe with the company and pro tection of your mother only.\" it \" It would be a pity were we not aU three"], [40, "30 VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE.

Flora changed colonr, and slightly trem bled, and then, as if ashamed of her fears, she said\u2014 own, upon which he knew he could depend, and he took good care to load them well, so that there could be no likelihood what ever of their missing fire at a critical mo ment. \" Now, Flora,\" he said, \" I have' Hen yon use fire-arms when you were much younger than you are now, and therefore I need give you no instructions.

It turned out to be a cloudy night, and therefore the moon's brilUance was nothing near equal to what it had been on the preceding night. Still, however, it had sufficient power over the vapours that frequently covered it for many minutes together, to produce a considerable light effect upon the face of nature, and thc night was con sequently very far, indeed, from what might be called a dark one. George, Henry, and Marchdale, met in one of the lower rooms of the house, pre vious to starting upon their expedition ; and after satisfying themselves that they had with them all the tools tbat were necessary, inclusive of the same small, but well-tempered iron crow-bar with which Marchdale had, on the night ofthe visit of the vampyre, forced open the door of Flora's chamber, they left the hall, and proceeded at a rapid pace towards tho church. \" I will, Henry. If ever human being was justified in the use of deadly weapons, I am now. Heaven protect me from a re petition of the visit to which I have now been once subjected. Rather, oh! much rather would I die a hundred deaths than suffer what I have suffered.\" \" Do not aUow it, dear Flora, to press too heavily upon your mind in dwelling upon it in conversation. I stUl entertain a sanguine expectation that something may arise to afford a far less dreadful explanation of what has occurred than what you have put npon it. Be of good cheer, Flora, we shall go one hour after sunset, and return in about two hours from the time at which we leave here, you may be assured.\" Notwithstanding this ready and cou rageous acquiescence of Flora in the ar rangement, Henry was not without his ap prehension that when the night should come again, her fears would return with it ; butie spoke to Mr. ChiUingworth upon the subject, and got that gentleman's ready consent to accompany them. Ha promised to meet them at the church porch exactly at nine o'clock, and matten \u2022were all arranged, and Henry waited with much eagerness and anxiety now for the coming night, which he hoped would dissi pate one of the fearful deductions which his imagination had drawn from recent circumstances. \"And Fiora does not seem much alarmed,\" said Marchdale, \" at -being left alone?\" \" No,\".replied Henry; \"she has made up her mind, with a strong natural courage which I knew was in her disposition, to re sist as much as possible the depressing effect of the awful visitation she has en dured.\" \"It would have driven some really mad.\" \u25a0**\u25a0* It would, indeed ; and her own reason tottered on its throne, but, thank Heaven, she has recovered.\" \"And I fervently hope that, through her Use,\" added Marchdale, \" she may never have such another trial.\" \" We will not for a moment believe that snch a thing can occur twice.\" \" She is one among a thousand. Most young girls would never at aU have re covered the fearful 6hock to the nerves.\" \"Not only has she recovered,\" said Henry, \" but a spirit \u2014 which I am rejoiced to see, because it is one wliich will uphold her, \u2014 of resistance now possesses her.\" He gave to Flora a pair of pistols of his"], [41, "VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE ._ OR, THE FE AST OF BLOOD. 31 \" Yes, she actually \u2014 I forgot to tell you before \u2014 but she actually asked me for arms to resist any second visitation.\" \" Y'ou much surprise me.'' \" Yes, I was surprised, as well as pleased, myself.\" \"I would have left her one of my pistols had I been aware of her having made such a request.

Many a lover of the antique and of the picturesque, for it was both, went out of his way while travelling in the neighbour hood to look at it, and it had an extensive and well-deserved reputation as a fine specimen of its class and style ol building. In K^.it, to the present day, are some fine specimens of the old Roman style of church building; and, although they are as rapidly pulled down as the abuse of modern architects, and the cupidity of speculators, and the vanity of clergymen can possib y encourage, in order to erect flimsy, Italianised structures in their stead, yet sufficient of them remain dotted over England to interest the traveller. At Willesden there is a church of this des cription, which will well repay a visit. This, then, was the kind of building into which it was the intention of our four friends to penetrate, not on an unholy, or an unjustifiable errand, but on one which, proceeding from good and proper motives, it waa highly desirable to conduct in as secret a manner as possible. The rroon was more densely covered by clouds than it had yet been that evening, when they reached the little wicket-gate which led into the churchyard, through which was a regularly used thoroughfare. \" We have a favourable night,\" re marked Henry, \"for we are not so likely to be disturbed.\" \" Hilloa!\" cried the worthy doctor again. \"Is that you, my friend, Henry Banner worth?\" \"It is,\" cried Henry. Mr. Chillingworth now came up to them and said \u2014 \" I was betore my time, so rather than wait at the church porch, whi.h would have exposed me to observation, perhaps, I thought it better to walk on, and chance meeting with you.\" \" You guessed we should come this way?\" \" Yes, and so it turns out, really. It is unquestionably your most direct route to the church.\" \"I think I will go back,\" said Mr. Marchdale. \"Back!\" exclaimed the doctor ; \"what for?\" \" I forgot the means of getting lights. We have candles, but no means of lighting them.\" \" Make yourselves easy on that score,\" said Mr. Chillingworth. \" I am never without some chemical matches of my own manufacture, so that, as you have the can dles, that can be no bar to our going on at once.\" \" That is fortunate,\" said Henry. \"Very,\" added Marchdale; \"for it seems a mile's hard walking for me, or at least half a mile from tne hall. Let us now push on.\" They did push on, all four walking at a brisk | ace. The church, although it be longed to the village, was not in it. On the contrary, it was situated at the end of a long lane, which was a mile nearly from the village, in the direction of the hall ; therefore, in going to it from the haU, that amount of distance was saved, although it was always caUed and considered the village church. It stood alone, with the exception of a glebe house and two cottages, that were occupied by persons who held situations about the sacred edifice, and who were supposed, being on the spot, to keep watch and ward over it. \" And now, the question is, how are we to get in?\" said Mr. Chillingworth, aa he paused, and glanced up at the ancient building. \" The door,\" said George, \" would effectually resist us.\" \"How can it be done, then?\" \" The only way lean think of,\" said Henry, \" ia to get out one of the small, diamond-shaped panes of glass from one of the low windows, and then we can one of us put in our hand6, and undo the fast ening, which is very simple, when tbe win dow opens like a door, and it is but a step into the cuurch.\" It was an ancient building of the early English stylo of architecture, or rather Norman, with one of those antique, square, short towers, bai|t of flint stones firmly embedded iu cement, which, lrom time, had acquired almost the consistency of stone itself. There were numerous arched windows, partaking something of the more florid gothic style, although scarcely orna mental enough to be called such. The edifice stood in the centre of a grave-yard, which extended over a space ot about half acre, and altogether it waa one of the \" A good way,\" said Marchdale. \" We will lose no time.\" They walked round the church till they can^e to a very low window indeed, near to an angle ofthe wall, where a huge abut ment struck far out into the burial-ground. \" Will you do it, Henry?\" said George. \" Yes. I have often noticed the fasten ings. Just give me a slight hoist up, and all will be right.\" G orge did so, and Henry with his knife easily bent back some of the leadwork which held in one of the panes of glass,"], [43, "THE FEAST OF BLOOD. 33 and then got it out whole. He handed it down to George, saying, \u2014 ' Take this, George. We can easily place it when we leave, so that there can be no signs left of any one having been here at ail.\" \" And a very good thing that it does, or else, if aU men were to look upon a dead body as something almost too dread ful to look upon, and by far too horrible to touch, surgery would losr; its value, and crime, in many instances of the most obnoxious character, would go un punished.\" \"If we have a light here,\" said Henry, \" we shall run the greatest chance in the world of being seen, for the church has many windows.\" \"Do not have one, then, by any mean?,\" said Mr. Cnillingworth. \" A matcQ held low down in the pew m y enable us to onen the vault.\" George took the piece of thick, dim coloured glass, and in another moment Henry hal succeeded in opening the window, and the mode of ingress to the o d church was fair and easy before them all, had there been ever so many. \"I wonder,\" said Marehdale, \"that a place so inefficientlly protected has never been robbed.\" \" No wonder at all,\" remarked Mr. Chil lingworth. \"There is nothing to take that I am aware of that would repay anybody the trouble of taking.\" \"Indeed!\" \" That will be the only plan.\" Henry led them to the pew which be longed to his family, aud in the floor of which was the trap-door. \"When was it last opened?\" inquired Marchdale. '\u25a0 Wlien my father died,\" said Henry; \"some ten mouths ago now, I should think.\" \"Not an article. The pulpit, to be sure, is covered with faded velvet ; but bevond that, and an old box, in which I believe no thing is left but some books, I think there is no temptation.\" \"And rhat, Heaven knows, is little enough, theu.'' \" Come on,\" said Henry. \" Be careful ; there ia nothing beuiratti the window, and the depth is about two feet.\" Thus guided, they all got fairly into the sacred eoiiice, and then Henty closed the window, and fastened it on the inside, as he said - \" The screws, then, have had ample time to fix themselves with fresh rust.\" \" Here is one of my chemical matches,\" said Mr. Criiliiugworih, as he suddenly irradiated the pew with a clear and beau tiful flame, that lasted about a minute. Tne heads of the screws were easily discernible, an* I the short time that the light lasted had enabled Henry to turn the key he had brought with him in the lock. \" We have nothing to do now but to set to work opening a way into the vault, and I trust that Heaven will pardon me for thus desecrating the tomb of my ancestors, from a consideration of the object I have in view by so doing \" \" It does seem wrong thus to tamper with the secrets of the tomb,\" remarked Mr. Marchddle. \" I think that without a light now,\" he said, \"I can turn the 6crews weU.\" ' Can you?\" \" Yes ; there are but sour.\" \"Try it, then.\" Henry did so, and from the screws having very large beads, and being made purposely, or tbe convenience of removal when re quired, with deep indentations to receive tne serew-drivrr, he sound no difficulty in feeling sor the proper places, and extract ing tne screws without any more lisht than was afforded to him from the general whitish aspect ofthe heavena. \"Now, Mr. C .illingworth,\" he said, \"another of your matches, if you please. I have all the screws so loose that I can piek them up with my fingers.\" \"The secrets of a fiddlestick !\".said the doctor. \" What secreta has the tomb, I wonder?\" \" Well, but, my dear sir \" \" Nay, my dear, it is high time that death, which is, then, the inevitabl us all, should be regarded with more philo sjphio eyes than it is.

In another moment the pew was as light as day, and Henry succeeded in taking out the few screws, whicb he placed in his pocket sor their greater security, since, of course, the intention rvaa to replace every thing exactly as it was found, in order that not the least surmise should arise in the mind of any person that the vault had"], [44, "VARNEY, THE VAMPYttE; OR, 34 from one end of it to the other was quite clearly discernible. been opened, aud visited for any purpose whatever, secretly or otherwise. \"Let us descend,\" said Henry. \"There is no further obstacle, my friends. Let us descend.\" CHAPTER VIII. \" If any one,\" remarked George, in a whisper, as they slowly descended thc stairs which conducted into the vault\u2014 \"if any one had told me that I should be descend ing into a vault for the purpose of ascertaing if a dead body, which bad been nearly a century there, was removed or not, ami had .become a vampyre, I should have denounce*! the idea as one of the most absurd that ever entered the brain of a human being.\" THE COFFIV .\u2014 THE A US ENCE OF TUB DEAD. \u2014 THE MYSTERIOUS CIRCUM STANCE, AND TUE CONSTERNATION OP GliOKGE. iey were all silent for a few moments as they looked around them with natural feelings of cu riosity.

What appears to us so improbable as to border even upon the impossible at onetime, is at another the only course of actiou which appears feasibly open to us to attempt to pursue.\" They had now reached the vault, tbe floor of which was composed of flat red tiles, laid in tolerable order the one- beside the other. As Henry had stated, the vault was by no means of large extent. Indeed, several of the apartments sor the living, at tho hall, were much larger than was that one destined for the dead. hough they had descended into it upon the occasion, nearly a year before, of their father being placed in it, still looked upon it with almost as curious eyes as they who now had their first sight of it. If a man be at all erf a thoughtful or imaginative cast of mind, some curious sensations are sure to come over him upon standing in such a place, where he knows around him He, in the calmness of death, those in whose veins have flowed kindred blood to him\u2014 who bore the same name, and who preceded him in the brief drama of his existence, influencing his destiny and his position in life probably largely by their actions, compounded of their vir tues and their vices. The atmoirphere was damp and noisome, but not by any means so bad as might have been expected, considering the number of months which had elapsed since last the van It was opened to receive one of its ghastly and still visitants. \" Now for one of your lights, Mr. Chil lingworth. You say you have thecandlcs, I think, Marchdale, alt lough you forgot thc matches?\" \" I have. They are here.\" Marchdale took from his pocket a parcel which contained several wax candles, and when it was opened, a smaller packet fell to the ground. \" Why, these are instataneous matches,\" said Mr. Chillingworth, as he Ufted the small packet up. \"They are ; and what a fruitless jour ney I should have had back to the hall,\" said Mr. Marchdale, \"if you had not been so well provided as you are with the means of getting a liijht. These matches, which I thought I had not with me, have been, in the hurry of departure, enclosed, you see, with the candles. Truly I should have hunted for them at home iu vain.\" Henry Bannerworth and his brother George were just the kind of persons to feel strongly such sensations. Both were reflective, imaginative, -educated young men, and, as the light from the wax can dle flashed upon their faces, it was evident how deeply they felt the situation in which they were placed. Mr. Chillingworth and Marchdale were silent. They both knew what was passing in the minds of the brothers, and they had too much delicacy to interrupt a train of thought which, although from having no affinity with the dead who lay around, they could not share in, yet they res pected. Henry at length, with a sudden start, seemed to recover himself from his reverie. Mr. Chillingworth lit the wax candle which was now handed to him by March dale, and in another moment the vault \"This is a time for action, George,\" he said, \" and not for romantic thought. Let roeead.\""], [45, "THE FEAST OF BLOOD. 35 \"Yes, yes,\" said George, and he ad vanced a step towards the centre of the vault. I was once fond of, entered many vaults, and I have always observed that an inner coffin of metal was sound and good, while the outer one of wood had rotted away, and yielded at once to the touch of the first hand that was laid upon it.\" \"But, admitting that to be the case,\" said Henry, \"how does that assist us in the identification of a coffin?\" \" Can you find out among aU these coffins, for there seem to be nearly twenty,\" said Mr. Chillingworth, \"which is the one we seek?\" \" I think we may,\" replied Henry. \" Some of the earlier coffins of our race, I know, were made of marble, and others of metal, both of which materials, I expect, wonld withstand the encroaches of time for a hundred years, at least.\" \"I have always, in my experience, found the name and rank of the deceased engraved upon the Ud of the inner coffin, as well as being set forti in a much more perishable manner on the plate which was secured to the outer one.\" \" Let us examine,\" said George. There were shelves or niches buUt into \"He is right,\" said Mr. Chillingworth. \" I wonder we never thonght of that. If your ancestor was buried in a leaden coffin, there wUl be no difficulty in finding which it is.\" the walls all round, on which the coffins were placed, so tbat there could not be much difficulty in a minnte examination of them all, the one after the other. When, however, they came to look, they sound that \" decay's effasive fin gers\" had been more busy than they could have imagined, and whatever they touched of the earlier coffins crumbled into dust before their very fingers. Henry seized the lijht, and proceeding to one of the coffins, which seemed to be a mass of decay, he pulled away some of the rotted wood-work, and then suddenly ex claimed \u2014 In some cases the inscriptions were quite illegible, and, in others, the plates that had borne them had fallen on to the floor of the vault, so that it was impossible to say to which coffin they belonged. \" You are quite right. Here is a firm strong leaden coffin within, which, although quite black, does not otherwise appear to have suffered.\" \" What is the inscription on that?\" said George. With difficulty the name on the lid was deciphered, but it was found not to be the coffin of him whom they sought. \" We can make short work of this,\" said Marchdale, \" by only examining those leaden coffins which have lost the plates from off their outer cases. There do not appear to be many in such a state.\" He then, with another light, which he lighted from the one that Henry now car ried, commenced actively assisting in the search, which was carried on silently for more then ten minutes. Of course, the more recent and fresh looking coffins they did not examine, be cause they could not have anything to do with the object of that melancholy Wsit. \" We shall arrive at no conclusion,\" said George. \"All seems to have rotted away among tho.-e coffins where we might expect to find the one belonging to Mar maduke Bannerworth, our ancestor.\" \" Here is a coffin plate,\" said Marchdale, taking one from the floor. He handed it to Mr. Chillingworth, who, npon an inspection of it close to the light, exclaimed \u2014 Suddenly Mr. Marchdale cried, in a tone of excitement \u2014 \" It must have belonged to the coffin you seek.\" \" I have found it. It is here.\" They all immediately surrounded the spot where he was, and then he pointed to the lid of a coffin, which he had been rub bing with his handkerchief, in order to make the inscription more legible, and said \u2014 \" What says it?\" \" Ye mortale remains of Marmaduke Bannerworth, Yeoman. God reste his soule. A.D. 1640.\" \" See. It is here.\" \" It is the plate belonging to his coffin,\" said Henry, \" and now our search is fruit less.\" \"It is so, indeed,\" exclaimed George, \"sor how can we teU to which of the coffins that havo lost the plates this one really belongs?\" \" f should not be so hopeless,\" said Marchdale. \" I have, from time to time, in the pursuit of antiquarian lore, which \" By the combined light of the candles they saw the words \u2014 \" Marmaduke Bannerworth, Yeoman. 1640.\" \" Yes, there can be no mistake here,\" said Henry. \" This is the coffin, and it shall be opened.\" \" I have the iron crow har here,\" said Maichdalc. \" It is an old friend of mine,"], [46, "36 VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE j OR, and I am accustomed to the use of it.

They stood around in silence, while Mr. Marchdale, with much care, proceeded to open the coffin, which seemed of great thickness, and waa of solid lead. It was probably the partial rotting of the metal, in consequence of the damps of that place, that made it easier to open the coffin than it otherwise would have been, but certain it was that the top came away re markably easy. Indeed, so easily did it come off, that another supposition might have been hazarded, namely, that it had never at all been effectually fastened. \"It would seem so,\" said Marchdale, sadly. \" Ob, that I were dead ! This is terrible. God of Heaven, why are these things ? Oh, if I were but dead, and so spared the torture of supposing sueb things possi ble.\" \" Think again, Mr. Chillingworth ; 1 pray you tbiuk again,\" cried .Marchdale. \" If I were to think for the remainder of my existence,\" he replied, \" I could come to no other conclusion. It is not a matter of opinion; it is a matter of fact.\" The few moments that elapsed were ones of very great suspense to every one there present ; and it would, indeed, be quite safe to assert, that all the world was, for the time, forgotten in the absorbing interest which appertained to the affair which was in progress. \"You are positive, then,\" said Henry, \" that the dead body of Marmaduke Ban nerworth has not rested here?\" The candles were now both held by Mr- ChUlingworth, and they were so held as to cast a fuU and clear light upon the coffin. Now the lid slid off, and Henry eagerly gazed into the interior. \"I am positive. Look for yourselves.

There is something, and what else can it be?\" They did all look for themselves, and the most casual glance was sufficient to satisfy the most sceptical. \"All is over,\" said Henry; \" let ns now leave this place; aud all I can now ask of you, my friends, is to lock this dreadful secret deep in your own hearts.\" \" It shaU never pass my lips,\" said Marchdale. \"Hold the lights,\" said Mr. Chilling worth. \" Hold the lights, some of you; let us be quite certain.\" George took the lights, and Mr. ChU lingworth, without any hesitation, dipped his hand at once into the coffin, and took up some fragments of rags which were there. They were so rotten, that they fell to pieces in his grasp, like so many pieces of tinder. \" Nor mine, you may depend,\" said the doctor. \"I was much in hopes that this night's work would have had the effect of dissipating, instead of adding to, the gloomy fancies that now possess you.\" \"Good heavens!\" cried George, \"can you call them fancies, Mr. ChiUingworth?\" \"I do, indeed.\" \" Have you yet a doubt?\" \" My young friend, I told you from the first, that I would not believe in your vampyre; and I tell you now, that if one was to como and lay hold of me by the throat, as long as I could at all gasp for breath I would teU him he was a d d impostor.\" There was a death-like pause of some few moment?, and then Mr. ChiUingworth said in a low voice \u2014 \" There is not the least vestige of a dead body here.\" Henry gave a deep groan, as he said \u2014 \" Mr. Chillingworth, can you take upon yourself to say that no corpse has under gone the process of decomposition in this coffin?\" \" This is carrying incredulity to the verge of obstinacy.\" \"Far beyond it, if you please.\" \" You wiU not be convinced ?\" said Marchdale. \"To answer your question exactly, as probably in your hurry you have worded it,\" said Mr. ChiUingworth, \"I cannot take upon rryself to say any sucb thing; bnt this I can say, namely, that in this coffin there are no animal remains, and that it is quite impossible that any corpse \"I most decidedly, on this point, will not.\" / \" Then you are one who would doubt a mircle, if you saw it with your own eyes.\""], [47, "THE FEAST OF BLOOD. 37 \"I would, because I do not believe in miracles. I should endeavour to fine some rational and some scientific means of ac counting for the phenomenon, and that's the very reason why we have no miracles now-a-days, between you and me, and no prophets and saints, and all that sort of thing.\" \" I would rather avoid such observations render the supposition, even in the most superstitions minds, that he was the vam pyre, a thing totaUy and physically impos sible. But now the whole question assumed a far more bewildering shape. The body wa3 not in its coffin \u2014 it had not there quietly slept the long sleep of death common to humanity. Where was it, then ? What had become of it ? Where, how, and under what circumstances had it been re moved ? Had it itself burst the bonds that held it, and hideously stalked forth into the world again to make one of its seeming inhabitants, and keep up for a hundred years a dreadful existence by such adven tures as it had consummated at the hall, where, in the course of ordinary human life, it had once lived ? All these were questions which irresisti bly pressed themselves upon the considera tion of Henry and his brother. They were awful questions. And yet, take any sober, sane, thinking, educated man, and show him aU that they had seen, subject him to all to which they had been subjected, and say if human reason, and all the arguments that the sub tlest brain could back it with, would be able to hold out against such a vast accu mulation o' horrible evidences, and say \u2014 \" I don't believe it.\" in such a place as this,\" said Marchdale. \"Nay, do not be the moral coward,\" cried Mr ChiUingworth, \" to make your opinions, or the expression of them, de pendent upou any certain locality.\" \" I know not what to think,\" said Henry; \" I am bewildered quite. Let us now come away.\" Mr. Marchdale replaced the lid of the coffin, and then the little party moved to wards the staircase. Henry turned before he ascended, and glanced back into the vault. \" Oh,\" he said, \" if I could but think there had been some mistake, some error of judgment, on which the mind could rest for hope.\" \" I deeply regret,\" said Marchdale, \"that I so strenuously advised this expe dition. I did hope that from it would have resulted much good.\" \" And you had every reason so to hope,\" said Chillingworth. \" I advised it like wise, and I tell you that its result perfectly astonished me, although I will not allow myself to embrace at once all the conclu sions to which it would seem to lead me.\" Mr. Chillingworth's was the only plan. He would not argue the question. He said at once \u2014 \"I wUl not beUeve this tMng\u2014 upon this point I wiU yield to no evidence whatever.\" \"I am satisfied,\" said Henry ; \" I know you both advised me for the best. The curse of Heaven seems now to have faUen upon me and my house.\" That was the only way of disposing of such a question ; but there are not many who could so dispose of it, and not one so much interested in it as were the brothers Bannerworth, who could at aU hope to get into such a state of mind. \" Oh, nonsense !\" said ChiUingworth. \" What for ?\" \"Alas ! I know not.\" \" Then you may depend that Heaven would never act so oddly. In the first place, Heaven don't curse anybody ; and, in the second, it is too just to inflict pain where pain is not amply deserved.\" They ascended the gloomy staircase of the vault. The countenances of both George and Henry were very much sad- dened, and it was quite evident that their thoughts were by tar too busy to enable them to enter into any conversation. They did not, and particularly George, seem to hear all that was said to them. Their intellects seemed almost stunned by the unexpected circumstance of the disappear ance of the body of their ancestor. All along they had, although almost un known to themselves, felt a sort of convic tion that they must find some remains of \"armaduke Bannerworth, which would The boards were laid carefully down again, and the screws replaced. Henry found himself unequal to the task, so it was done by Marchdale, who took pains to replace everytMng in the same state in which they had found it, even to the lay ing even the matting at the bottom of the pew. Then they extinguished the light, and, with heavy hearts, they all walked towards the window, to leave the sacred edifice by the same means they had entered it. \" Shall we replace the pane of glass ?\" said Marchdale. \"Ob, it matters not \u2014 it matters not,\" said Henry, listlessly ; \" nothing matters now.

They may be incomprehen sible ; they may be inconsistent ; and some of them may look ridiculous ; but still they are sacred and sublime, and I will not renounce them, although my reason may not accord with them, because they are the laws of Heaven.\" \"Indeed!\" \" Yes ; I get very angry, and that gets up a kind of obstinacy, which makes me not feel half so much mental misery as would be my portion if I were to succumb to the evil, and commence whining over it, as many people do under the pretence of being resigned.\" \" But this family affliction of mine tran scends anything that anybody else ever endured.\" No wonder this powerful argument silenced Mr. ChUlingworth, who was one of those characters in society who hold most dreadful opinions, and who would destroy religious beliefs, and aU the different Beets in the world, if they could, and en deavourto introduce instead some horrible system of human reason and profound philosophy. But how soon the religions man silences his opponent ; and let it not be supposed that, because his opponent says no more upon the subject, he does so because he is disgusted with the stupidity of the other ; no, it is because he is completely beaten, and has nothing more to say. The distance now between the church and the ball was nearly traversed, and Mr. ChiUingworth, who was a very good man, notwithstanding his disbelief in certain things of course paved the way for him to hell, took a kind leave of Mr. Marchdale and the brothers, promising to call on the following morning and see Flora. Henry and George then, in earnest con versation with Marchdale, proceeded home wards. It was evident that the scene in the vault had made a deep and saddening impression upon them, and one which was not likely easUy to be eradicated. \" I don't know that ; but it is a view of the subject which, if I were you, would only make me more obstinate.\" \" What can I do ?\" \"In the first place, I would say to my self, ' There may or there may not be su pernatural beings, who, from some physical derangement of the ordinary nature of things, make themselves obnoxious to living people ; if there are, d \u2014 n them !

CHAPTER IX. \" But it is but sor two hours,\" thought Plora, \" and two hours will soon pass away.\" There was, too, another feeling wbich gave her some degree of confidence, al though it arose from a bad source, inas much as it was one which showed power fuUy how much her mind was dwelling on the particulars of the horrible belief in the class of supernatural beings, one of which she believed had visited her.

ESPITE the full and free consent which Flora had given to her brothers to en trust her solely to the care ot That consideration was this : The two hours of absence from the hall of its male inhabitants would be from nine o'clock until eleven, and those were not the two hours during which she felt that she would be most timid on account of the vampyre. \"It was after midnight before,\" she thought, \"when it came, and perhaps it may not be able to come earlier. It may not have tbe power, until that time, to make its hideous visit\", and, therefore, 1 will believe myself safe.\" She had made up her mind not to go to bed untU the return of her brothers, and she and her mother sat in a small room that was used as a breakfast-room, and which had a latticed window that opened on to the lawn. her mother and her own cou rage at the hall, she felt a creater fear creep over her after they were gone than she chose to acknowledge. A s jrt of presentiment appeared to come over her that some evil was abont to occur, and more than once she caught herself almost in the act of saying\u2014 \" I wish they had not gone.\" Mrs. Bannerworth, too, could not be supposed to be entirely destitute of un comfortable feelings, when she came to consider how poor a guard sbe was over her beautiful child, and how much terror might even deprive her of the Uttle power This window had in the inside strong oaken shutters, which had been fastened as No. 6."], [50, "40 VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE ; OR, securely as their construction would admit of some time before the departure of the brothers and Mr. Marchdale on that melancholy expedition, the object of which, if it had been known to her, would have added so much to the terrors -rf poor Flora. gether she presented a picture of much mental suffering. They now conversed in anxious whis pers, aud almost all they said consisted in anxious wishes for the return of the bro thers and Mr. Marchdale. \" You will be happier and more assured, my dear, with some company,\" said Mrs. Bannerworth. \" Shall I ring for the servants, and let them remain in the room with us until they who are our best safe guards, next to Heaven, return?\" \" Hush \u2014 hush\u2014 hush, mother !\" \" Wbat do you hear ?\" \" I thought I heard a faint sound.\" \" I heard nothing, dear.\" \" Listen again, mother. Surely I could not be deceived so often. I have now, at least, six times heard a sound as if some one were outside by the window.\" \" No, no, my darling \u2014 do not think so. Your imagination is active, and in a state of excitement.\" It was not even guessed at, however remotely, so that she had not the addi* tional affliction of thinking that, whUe she was sitting there, a prey to all sorts of imaginative terrors, they were perhaps gathering fresh evidence \u2014 as, indeed, they were \u2014 of the dreadful reality of the appear ance which, bnt for the collateral circum stances attendant upon its coming and its going, she would faiu have persuaded her self was but the vision of a dream. It was before nine that the brothers started, but in her own mind Flora gave them to eleven ; and when she heard ten o'clock sound from a clock which stood in the hall, she felt pleased to think that in another hour they would surely be at home. \" It is, and yet\u2014\u2014\" \" Believe me, it deceives you.\" \"I hope to Heaven it doesl\" There was a pause of some minutes' duration, and then Mrs. Bannerworth again urged slightly the calling of some of the servants, for she thought that their presence might have the effect of giving a different direction to her child's thoughta; but Flora saw her place her hand upon the bell, and she said \u2014 \"No, mother -no. Not yet \u2014 not yet. Perhaps I am deceived. Mrs. Bannerworth upon this sat down ; but no sooner had she done so than she heartily regretted she had not rung the bell ; for, before another word could be spoken, there came too perceptibly upon their ears for there to be any mistake at all about it, a strange scratching noise upon the window outside. A faint cry came from Flora's lips, as she exclaimed, in a voice of great agony \u2014 \" Oh, God !\u2014 oh, Gad ! It has come again !\" Mrs. Bannerworth became faint, and un able to move or speak at all. She could only sit Uke one paralysed, and unable to do more than listen to and see what was going on. The scratching noise continued for a few seconds, and then altogether ceased. Per haps, under ordinary circumstances, such a sound outside the window would have scarcely afforded room for comment at aU ; or, if it had, it would have been attributed to some natural effect, or to the exertions of some bird or animal to obtain admittance to the house. \"My dear,\" said her mother, \"you look more like yourself, now.\" \"Dol, mother?'' \" Yes \u2014 you are well again.\" \"Ah, if I could forget \" \" Time, my dear Flora, will enable you to do so, and all the fear of what made you so unwell wiU pass away. You wUl soon forget it all.\" \" I will hope to do so.\" \" Be assured that, some day or another, something will occur, as Henry says, to explain all that has happened, in some way consistent with reason and the ordinary nature of thinga, my dear Flora.\" \" Oh, I wUl cling to such a belief. I will get Henry, upou whose judgment I know I can rely, to teU me so, and each time that I hear such words from his lips I will contrive to dismiss some portion of the terror which now, I cannot but con fess, clings to my heart.\" Flora laid her hand upon her mother's arm, and in a low, anxious tone of voice, said \u2014 \" Listen, mother I\" Mrs. Bannerworth turned pale, as she said \u2014 \" Listen to what, dear?\" \" Within these iast ten minutes,' said Flora, \" I have thought three or four times that I heard a noise without. Nay, mother, do not tremble \u2014 it may be only fancy.\" Flora herself trembled, and was of a death-like paleness.

It was \u2014 yes, it was \u2014 the van pyre ! It stood for a moment gazing at her, and then in the hideous way it had at tempted before to speak, it apparently endeavoured to utter some words which it could not make articulate to human ears. The pistols lay before Flora. Mechani cally she raised one, and pointed it at the figure. It advanced a step, and then she pulled the trigger. A stunning report followed. There was a loud cry of pain, and the vampyre fled. The smoke and the confusion that were in cidental to the shot prevented her frorn seeing if the figure walked or ran away. She thought she heard a crashing sound among the plants outside the window, ag if it had fallen, but she did not feel quite sure. When the scratching noise ceased, Flora spoke in a low, anxious whisper, as she said \u2014 \" Mother, you heard it, then?\" Mrs. Bannerworth tried to speak, but she could not ; and then suddenly, with a loud clash, the bar, which on the inside appeared to fasten the shutters strongly, fell as if by some invisible agency, and the shutters now, but sor the intervention of the window, could be easily pushed open from without. Mrs. Bannerworth covered her face with her hands, and after rocking to and fro for a moment, 6he seU off her chair, having fainted with the excess of terror that came over her. It was no effort of any reflection, bnt a purely mechanical movement, that made her raise the other pistol, and discharge that likewise in the direction the vampyre had taken. Then casting the weapon away, she rose, and made a frantic rush from the room. She opened the door, and was dashing out, when she found her self caught in the circUng arms of some one who either had been there waiting, or who had just at that moment got there. The thought that it was the vampyre, who by some mystesious means had got there, arid was about to make her his prey, now overcame her completely, and she sunk into a state of utter insensibility on the moment. For about the space of time in which a fast speaker could count twelve, Flora thought her reason was leaving her; but it did not. She found herself recovering; and there she sat, with her eyes fixed upon the window, looking more like some ex quisitely chiselled statue of despair than a being of flesh and blood, expecting each moment to bave her eyes blasted by some horrible appearance, such as might be sup posed to drive her to madness. And now again came the strange knock ing or scratching against the glass of the window. This continued for some minutes, during which it appeared likewise to Flora that some confusion was going on at another part of the house, for she fancied she heard voices and the banging of doors. It seemed to her as if she must have sat 1 okmg at the shutters of tnat window a long time before she 6aw them shake, and then one wide-hinged portion of them slowly opened. Once again horror appeared to be on the pi int of producing madness in her brain, and then, as besoie, a fi.e.ing of calmness rapidly ensued. She was able to see plainly that some thing was by the window, but what it was she could not plai ly discern, in conse quence of the lights she had in tbe room. A few moments, however, sufficed to settle that mystery, for tbe window was opened and a figure stood before her. Oue glance, one terrified glance, in which her whole houl was concentiated, sufficed to show her who and what the figure was.

Amid the stiUness of the night, it came upon them with so Budden a shock, that they"], [52, "42 VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE; OR, involuntarily paused, and there came from the lips of each an expression of alarm. \" Good heavens !\" cried George, \" can that be Flora firing at any intruder?\" \"It must be,\" cried Henry; \"she has in her possession the only weapons in the house.\" Mr. Marchdale turned very pale, and trembled slightly, but he did not speak. \" On, on'\" cried Henry ; \" for God's sake, let us hasten on.\" As he spoke, he cleared the gate at a bound, and at a terrific pace he made to wards the house, passing over beds, and plantations, and flowers heedlessly, so that he went the most direct way to it. Before, however, it was possible for any human speed to accomplish even half of the distance, the report of the other shot came upon his ears, and he even fancied he beard the bullet whistle past his head in tolerably close proximity. This suppo sition gave him a clue to the direction at all events lrom whence the shots proceeded, otherwise he knew not from which window they were fired, because it had not oc currred to him, previous to leaving home, to inquire in which room Flora and his mother were Ukely to be seated waiting his return. Such a strange scene as that smalt room now exhibited had never been equalled in Bannerworth Hall. There was young Mr. Holland, of whom mention has already been made, as the affianced lover of Flora, supporting her fainting form. There was Henry doing equal service to hia mother; and on the floor lay the two pistols, and one of the candles, which had b^en upset in the confusion; while the terrified atti tudes of George and Marchdale at the window completed the strange-looking picture. \" Whatisthis\u2014 oh! what has happened?\" cried George. \" I know not\u2014 I knownot,'\" said Henry. \" Some one summon the servants ; I am nearly mad.\" Mr. Marchdale at once rung the beU, for George looked so faint and ill as to be incapable of doing so ; and he rung it so loudly and so effectually, that tho two servants who had been employed sud denly upon the others leaving came with much speed to know what was the matter. \"See to your mistress,\" said Henry. \" She is dead, or has fainted. For God's sake, let who can give me some account of what has caused all this confusion here.\" \" Are you aware, Henry,\" said March dale, \" that a stranger is present in the room?\" He was right as regarded the buUet. It was that winged messenger of death which had passed his head in such very dangerous proximity, and, consequently, he made with tolerable accuracy towards the open window from whence the shots had been sired. The night was not near so dark as it had been, although even yet it was very far from being a light one, and he was soon enabled to see that there was a room, the window of which was wide open, and Ughts burning on the table within. He made towards it in a moment, and entered it. To his astonishment, the first objects he beheld were Flora and a stranger, who was now supporting her in his arms. To grapple him by the throat was the work of a moment, but the stranger cried aloud in a voice which sounded familiar to Henry, \" Good God, are you aU mad?\" Henry relaxed his hold, and looked in his face. He pointed to Mr. Holland as he spoke, who, before Henry could reply, said \u2014 \"Sir, I may be a stranger to you, as you are to me, and yet no stranger to those whose home this is.\" \"No, no,\" said Henry, \"you are no stranger to us, Mr. Holland, but are thrice welcome \u2014 none can be more welcome. Mr. Marchdale, this is Mr. Holland, of whom you have heard me speak.\" \" I am proud to know you, sir,\" said Marchdale. \" Sir, I thank you,\" repUed HoUand, coldly. It wiU so happen ; but at first sight, it appeared as if those two persons had some sort of antagonistic feeUng towards each other, which threatened to prevent effec tuaUy their ever becoming intimate friends. The appeal of Henry to the servants to know if they could tell him what had occurred was answered iu the negative. AU they knew was, that they had heard two shots fired, and that, since then, they had remained where they were, in a great fright, until the bell was rung violently. This was no news at all, and, therefore, the only chance was, to wait patiently for the recovery ofthe mother, or of Flora, from one or the other of whom surely some \" Gracious heavens, it is Mr. Holland!\" he said. \" Yes ; did you not know me?\" Henry was bewildered. He staggered to a seat, and, in doing so, he saw his mother stretched apparently lifeless upon the floor. To raise her was the work of a moment, and then Marchdale aud George, who had followed him as fast as they could, appeared at the open window."], [53, "THE FEAST OF BLOOD. 4.5 \" You \u2014 you hit it with the bullet ?\"inter posed Mr. Marehdale. \"Perhaps you killed it?\" information could be at once then pro cured.

Tell him I am mad.\" \"Come with me,\" whispered Henry to Holland. \" I pray you come with me at once, and you shall know all.\" \"I\u2014 will.\" \"George, stay with Flora for a time. Come, come, Mr. Holland, you ought, and you shall know all; then you can come to a judgment for yourself. This way, sir. You cannot, in the wildest freak of your imagination, guess that which I have now to tell you.\" Never was mortal man so utterly bewil dered by the events of the last hour of his existence as was now Charles Holland, aud truly he might well be so. He had arrived in England, and made what speedhe could o thef house of a family whom he admired or their intelligence, their htighculture, and in one member of which his whole thoughts of domestic happiness in this world were centred, and he found nothing but confu sion, incoherence, mystery, and the wildest dismay. Well might he doubt if he were sleeping or waking \u2014 well might he ask if he or they were mad. And now, as, after a long, lingering look of affection upon the pale, suffering face of Flora, he follower! Henry from the room, his thoughts were busy in fancying a thou sand vague and wild imaginations with respect to the communication which was promised to be made to him. But, as Henry had truly said to him, not in the wildest freak of his imagination could he conceive of anything near the terrible strangeness and horror of that which he had to tell him, and consequently he found himself closeted with Henry in a small private room, removed from the domestic part of the hall to the full in as bewildered a state as he had been from the first CHAPTER XL THB COMMUNICATION' TO THE LOVEB.\u2014 THE HEART'S DESPAIR. ! Is sympathe tic, and any one who had looked upon the features of Charles Hol land, now that he was seated with Henry Bannerworth, in expectation of a communi cation which his fears told him was to blast all his dearest and most fondly cherished hopes for ever, would scarce have recognised in him the same young man who, one short hour be fore, had knocked so loudly, and so full of joyful hope and expectation, at the door of the hall. But so it was. He knew Henry Ban nerworth too well to suppose that any un real cause could blanch his cheek. He knew Flora too well to imagine for one mo ment that caprice had dictated the, to him, fearful words of dismissal she had uttered to him. Happier would it at that time have been for Charles Holland had she acted capri ciously towards him, and convinced him that his true heart's devotion had been cast at the feet of one unworthy of so really noble a gift. Pride would then have en abled him, no doubt, successfully to resist the blow. A feeling of honest and proper indignation, at having his feeUngs trifled with, would, no doubt, have sustained him ; but, alas ! the case seemed widely different. True, she implored him to think of her no more \u2014 no longer to cherish in his breast the fond dream of affection which had been its guest so long ; but the manner in which she did so brought along with it an irre sistible conviction, that she was making a noble sacrifice of her own feelings tor him, from some cause which was involved in the proloundest mystery. But now he was to hear. Henry had promised to tell him, and as he looked into his pale, but handsomely intellectual face, he half dreaded the disclosure he yet panted to hear. \"Tell me aU, Henry\u2014 teU me all,\" be 6aid. \" Upon the words that come from your lips I know I can rely.\" \" I willjhave no reservations with you,\" said Henry, sadly. \" You ought to know"], [55, "THE PEAST OF BLOOD 45 all, and you shall.

But, Henry, if you would aUow me to sleep in that room where the portrait hangs of him whom you sup pose to be the vampyre, I should prefer it.\" \"Prefer it!\" to him by Henry Bannerworth, had about it too many strange, confirmatory circum stances to enable him to treat it, in his own mind, with the disrespect that some mere freak of a distracted and weak imagination would, most probably, have received from him. He had found Flora in a state of excite ment which conld arise only from some such terrible cause as had been mentioned by her brother, and then he was, from an occurrence which certainly never could have entered into his calculations, asked to forego the bright dream of happiness which he had held so long and so rapturously to his heart. \"Yes; I am not one who courts danger for danger's sake, but I would rather oc cupy that room, to see if the vampyre, who perhaps has a partiality for it, wdl pay me a visit.\" How truly he found that the course of true love ran not smooth; and yet how Uttle would any one have suspected that from such a cause as that which now op pressed his mind, any obstruction would arise. \" As you please, Charles. You can have the apartment It is in the same state as when occupied by Flora. Nothing has been, I beUeve, removed from it.\" \" You wiU let me, then, whUe I remain here, caU it my room?\" \" Assuredly.\" This arrangement was accordingly made, to the surprise of all the household, not one of whom would, indeed, have slept, or at tempted to sleep there for any amount of reward. But Charles HoUand had his own reasons for preferring that chamber, and he was conducted to it in the course of half an hour by Henry, who looked around it with a shudder, as he bade his young friend good night. Flora might have been fickle and false; he might have seen some other fairer face, which might have enchained his fancy, and woven for him a new heart's chain ; death might have stepped between him and the realization of his fondesAiipes ; loss of for tune might have made the love crnel which would have yoked to its distresses a young and beautiful girl, reared in the lap of luxury, and who was not, even by those who loved her, suffered to feel, even in later years, any of the pinching necessities of the family. All these things were possible \u2014 some of them were probable ; and yet none of them had occurred. She loved him stUl ; and he, although he had looked on many a fair face, and basked in the sunny smiles of beauty, had never for a moment forgotten her faith, or lost his devotion to his own dear English girl."], [59, "THE FEAST OF BLOOD. 49 who, after death, was supposed to have borrowed so new and so hideous an exist ence, combined with its artistic merits, that chained him to the spot. \" I shaU now,\" he said, \" know that face again, let me see it where I may, or under what circumstances I may. Each feature is now indelibly fixed npon my memory \u2014 I never can mistake it.\" Fortune he had enough for both; death had not even threatened to rob him of the prize of such a noble and faithful heart '\u2022 winch he had won. But a horrible super- stition bad arisen, which seemed to place at once an impassable abyss between them, and to say to bim, in a voice of thundering r denunciation \u2014 \"Charles Holland, wiU you have a vam pyre sor your bride?\" The thought was terrific. He paced the gloomy chamber to and fro with rapid strides, until the idea came across his mind that by so doing he might not only be pro claiming to his kind entertainers how much he was meutaUy distracted, but he likewise might be seriously disturbing them. The mcment this occurred to him he sat He turned aside as he uttered these words, and as he did so his eyes seU upon a part ofthe ornamental frame which com- posed the edge of the panel, and which seemed to him to be of a different colour from the surrounding portion. Curiosity and increased interest prompted him at once to make a closer inquiry into the matter ; and, by a careful and dUigent scrutiny, he was almost induced to come to the positive opinion, that at no very distant period in time gast, the portrait had been removed from the place it occu- pied. When once this idea, even vague and indistinct as it was, in consequence of the sUght grounds he formed it on, had got possession of his mind, he felt most anxious to prove its verification or its fallacy. He held the candle in a variety of situa- tions, so that its light fell in different ways on the picture ; and the more he examined it, the more he felt convinced that it must have been moved lately. It would appear as if, in its removal, a piece of the old oaken carved framework of the panel had been accidentally broken off, which caused the new look of the fracture, and that this accident, from the nature of the broken bit of framing, could have occurred in any other way than from an actual or attempted removal of the picture, he felt was extremely unlikely. He set down the candle on a chair near at hand, and tried if the panel was fast in its place. Upon the very first touch, he felt convinced it was not so, and that it easily moved. How to get it out, thongb, presented a difficulty, and to g6t it out was tempting. \" Who knows,\" he said to himself, \" what may be behind it? This is an old baronial sort of hall, and the greater por tion of it was, no doubt, built at a time when the construction of such places as hidden chambers and intricate staircases were, in aU binldings of importance, considered a desideratum.\" down, and was profoundly still sor some time. lie then glanced at the light which had be given to him, and he sound him- self almost unconsciously engaged in a mental calculation as to how long it would last him in the night. Half ashamed, then, of such terrors, as such a consideration would seem to indi- cate, he was on the point of hastUy extin- guishing it, when he happened to cast his eyes on the now mysterious and highly in- teresting portrait in the panel. The picture, as a picture, was weU done, whether it was a correct likeness or not of the party whom it represented. It was one of those kind of portraits that seem so life- like, that, as you look at them, they seem to return your gaze fuUy, and even to follow you with their eyes from place to place. By candle-fight such an effect is more likely to become striking and remarkable than by daylight ; and now, as Charles Holland shaded his own eyes from the light, so aa to cast its full radiance upon the portrait, he felt wonderlully interested in its life-like appearance. \" Here is true he said ; \"such as I have not before seen. How strangely this Ukeness of a man whom I never saw, seems to gaze upon me.\" Unconsciously, too, he aided the effect, which he justly enough called life-like, by a slight movement of the candle, such as any one not blessed with nerves of iron would be sure to make, and such a move ment made the face look as if it were in spired with vitality. | Charles remained looking at the portrait (or a considerable period of time. He found a kind of fascination in it which pre \\-uteil him from drawing his eyes away 1 11,111 ii.

They may not, of course, say so, bnt they will think that my appearing so bold waa one of those acts of bravado which I have not courage to carry fairly out.\" Taking this view of the matter was just the way to enUst a young man's pride in staying, under all circumstances, where he was, and, with a slight accession of colour, which, even although he was alone, would visit his cheeks, Charles Holland said aloud \u2014 Perhaps the wish was more father to the thought than he, in the partial state of excitement he was in, really imagined ; but so it was. He felt convinced that he should not be satisfied untU he had re moved that panel from the waU, and seen what was immediately behind it. After the panel containing the picture had been placed where it was, it appeared that pieces of moulding had been inserted all around, which had had the effect of keeping it in its place, and it was a frac ture of one of these pieces which had first called Charles HoUand's attention to the probabUity of the picture having been removed. That he should have to get two, at least, of the pieces of moulding away, before he could hope to remove the pic ture, was to him qii&t apparent, and he was considering how he should ac complish such a result, when he was suddenly startled by a knock at his cham ber door. Until that sudden demand for admission at his door came, he scarcely knew to what a nervous state he had worked himself up. It was an odd sort of tap \u2014 one only \u2014 a single tap, as if some one demanded ad mittance, and wished to awaken his atten tion with the least possible chance of dis turbing any one else. \" Come in,\" said Charles, for he knew he had not fastened his door ; \" come in.\" There was no reply, but after a mo ment's pause, the same sort of low tap came again. Again he cried \" Come in,\" but, who ever it was, seemed determined that the door should be opened for him, and no movement was made from the outside. A third time the tap came, and Charles was very close to the door when he heard it, for with a noiseless step he had ap proached it intending to open it. The instant this third mysterious demand for admission came, he did open it wide. There was no one there ! In an instant he crossed the threshold into the cor ridor, which ran right and left. A win dow at one end of it now sent in the moon's rays, so that it was tolerably Ught, but he could see no one. Indeed, to look for any one, he felt sure was needless, for he had opened his chamber-door almost simultaneously with the last knock for ad mission. \"1 wUl remain the occupant of this room come what may, happen what may. No terrors, real or unsubstantial, shall drive me from it ; I will brave them all, and re main here to brave them.\" Tap came the knock at the door again, and now, with more an air of vexation than fear, Charles turned again towards it, and listened. Tap in another minute again succeeded, and much annoyed, he walked close to the door, and laid his hand upon the lock, ready to open it at the precise moment of another demand for admission being made. He had not to wait long. In about half a minute it came again, and, simultaneously with the sound, the door flew open. There was no one to be seen ; but as he opened the door, he heard a strange sound in the corridor \u2014 a sound which scarcely could be caUed a groan, and scarcely a sigh, but seemed a compound of both, having the agony of the one combined with the sad ness of the other. From what direction it came he could not at the moment decide, but he called out \u2014 \"Who's there? who's there?\" The echo of his own voice alone an swered him for a few moments, and then he heard a door open, and a voice, whicb he knew to be Henry's, cried \u2014 \" What is it? who speaks?\" \" Henry,\" said Charles. \" Yes \u2014 yes \u2014 yes.\" \"I fear I have disturbed you?\" \" You have been disturbed yourself, or you would not have done so. I shaU be with you in a moment.\" \"It is strange,\" he said, as he lingered on the threshold of his room-door for some moments ; \" my imagination could not so completely deceive me. There was most certainly a demand for admission.\" Slowly, then, he returned to his room again, and closed the door behind him."], [61, "THE FEAST OP BLOOD. 51 and, upon a close examination, you wil* perceive that a piece of the moulding which holds it in its place has been chipped off, which is done in such a place tbat I think it could only have arisen during the re moval of the picture.\" \" You must be mistaken.\" Henry closed his door before Charles Holland could tell him not to come to him, as he intended to do, for he felt ashamed to have, in a manner of speaking, summoned assistance for so trifling a cause of alarm as that to which he had been subjected. However, he could not go to Henry's chamber to forbid him from coming to his, and, more vexed than be fore, he retired to his room again to await his coming. He left the door open now, so that Henry Bannerworth, when he had got on some articles of dress, walked in at once, say ing\u2014 \" I cannot, of course, take upon myself, Heniy to say precisely snch is the case,\" said Charles. \" But there is no one here to do so.\" \" That I cannot say.

We thought of taking it away altogether, but when Flora left this room the idea was given up as useless. Remain here a few moments, Jand I will endeavour to find something which shall assist us in its re moval.\" \"What bas happened, Charles?\" \"A mere trifle, Henry, concerning which I am ashamed you should have been at all disturbed.\" \"Never mind that, I was wakeful.\" \" Did you hear me open my door?\" \" I heard a door open, which kept me listening, but I could not decide which door it was till I heard your voice in the corri dor.\" Henry left tbe mysterious chamber in order to search in his own for some means of removing the frame-work of the picture, so that the panel would sUp easily out, and while he was gone, Charles .Holland con tinued gazing upon it with greater interest, if possible, than before. In a few minutes Henry returned, and althongh what he had succeeded in find ing were very inefficient implements for the purpose, yet with their aid the two young men set about the task. \" WeU, it was this door ; and I opened it twice in consequence ofthe repeated taps for admission that came to it ; some one has been knocking at it, and, when I go to it, lo ! I can see nobody.\" \"Indeed!\" \" Such is the case.\" \" You surprise me.\" \" I am very sorry to have disturbed you, because, upon such a ground, I do not feei that I ought to have done so ; and when I called out in the corridor, I assure you it was with no such intention.\" \" Do not regret it for a moment,\" said Henry; \"jyou were quite justified in making an alarm on such an occasion.' ' It is said, and said truly enough, that \" where there is a wiU there is a way,\" and although the young men had no tools at aU adapted for the purpose, they did suc ceed in removing the moulding from the sides of the panel, and then by a little tapping at one end of it, and using a knife as a lever at the other end of the panel, they got it fairly out. \"It's strange enough, but still it may arise from some accidental cause ; admit ting, if we did but know it, of gome ready enough explanation.\" \" It may, certainly, but, after what has happened already, we may weU suppose a mysterious connexion between any un usual sight or sound, and the fearful ones we have already seen.\" \" Certainly we may.\" \"How earnestly that strange portrait seems to look upon us, Charles.\" \" It does, and I have been examining it carefuUy.

Onthe other side there was nothing but a rough wooden wall, against which the finer and more nicely finished oak panelUng of the chamber rested. \" There is no mystery here,\" said Henry. \" None whatever,\" said Charles, as he tapped the wall with his knuckles, and found it all hard and sound. \" We are foUed.\" \" We are indeed.\" \" I had a strange presentiment, now,\" added Charles, \"that we should make some discovery that would repay us for our trouble.

We say Charles reluctantly assented, be- cause, although he had now bad ocular demonstration that therewas really nothing behind the panel but the ordinary panel work which might havo been expected from the construction of the old houae, yet he .could not, even with such a fact staring liim iu the face, get rid entirely of the feeling that had come across him, to the effect that the picture had some mystery or another. \" Henry ! For God'.i sake open the win dow forme, Henry ! The fastening of the window is known to you, but not to me. Open it for me.\" Thus called uponjlenrysprungforward, and bv this time the report of the pistol bad effectually alarmed the whole house hold. The flashing of lights from tho cor ridor came into th# room, and in another minute, just as Henry succeeded in getting the window wide open, and Charles Holland had made his way on the balcony, both George Bannerworth and Mr. Marchdale entered the chamber, eager to know what had occurred. To their easier questions Henry replied,\u2014 \" Ask me not now,\" and then calling to Charles, he said, \u2014 \"Remain where you are, Charles, while I run down to the garden immediately beneath the balcony.\" \" Yes \u2014 yes,\" said Charles. Henry made prodigious haste, and wa? in the garden immediately below the bay win dow in a wonderfully short space of time. He spoke to Charles, saying,\u2014 \"Will you now descend? I can see nothing here ; but we will both make a search.\" \" You are not yet satisfied,\" said Henry, as he observed the doubtful look of Charles Holland's face. \" My dear friend,\" said Charles, \" I mil not deceive you. I am much disappointed that we have made no discovery behind that picture.\" \" Heaven knows we have mysteries enough in our family,\" said Henry. Even as he spoke they were both startled by a strange clattering noise at the window, which was accompanied by a shrill, odd kind of shriek, which sounded fearful and preternatural on thc night air. \" What is that?\" said Charles. George and Mr. Marchdale were both now in the balcony, and they would have descended Ukewiae, but Henry said, \u2014 \" Do not all leave the houae. God only knows, now, situated as we are, what might happen.\" \" I will remain, then,\" said George. \"I have been sitting up to-night as the guard, and, therefore, may as well continue to do so.\" \" God only knows,\" said Henry. The two young men naturally turned their earnest gaze in the direction of the window, which we have before remarked was one unprovided with shutters, and there, to their intense surprise, they saw, slowly rising np from the lower part of it, what appeared to be a human form. Henry would have dashed forward, but Charles restrained him, and drawing quickly from its case a large holster pistol, he leveUed it carefully at the figure, saying in a whisper, \u2014 \" Henry, if I don't hit it, I wil! consent to forfeit my head.\" He pulled the trigger\u2014 a loud report fol lowed\u2014the room was filled with smoke, and then all was stiU. A circumstance, however, had occurred, aa a consequence of the concussion of air produced by the dis charge of the pistol, which neither of the young men had for the moment calculated upon, and that waa the putting out of the only fight they there had. In spite of this circumstance, Charles, the moment he had discharged the pistol, dropped it and sprung forward to the win dow. But here he was perplexed, for he could not find the old-fashioned, intricate fastening which held it shut, and he had to caU to Henry,\u2014 Marchdale and Charles Holland clam bered over the balcony, and easily, from its insignificant height, dropped into the garden. The night waa beautiful, and profoundly still. There was not a breath of air sufficient to stir a leaf on a tree, and the very flame of the candle which Charles had left burning in the balcony burnt clearly and steadily, being perfectly un ruffled by any wind. It cast a sufficient Ught close to the window to make everything very plainly visible, and it was evident at a glance that no oljrrct waa there, although, had that figuro which Charles shot at, and no doubt hit, been flesh and blood, it must have dropped immediately below. As they looked up for a moment after a cursory examination of the ground, Charlea exclaimed \u2014 \" Look at the window. As the light is now situated, you can see the hole made in one of the panes of glass by the passage of the buUet from my pistol.\" They did look, and there the clear, round"], [63, "THE FEAST OF BLOOD. 53 hole, without any starring, which a bullet discharged close to a pane of glass wUl make in it, was clearly and plainly dis cernible. dreadful tribe of beings who cling to existence by feeding, in the most dreadful manner, upon the blood of others\u2014 Oh, it is too dreadful to contemplate !

I wiU not beUeve it ; and were death itself my portion for my want of faith. I would this moment die in my dis beUef of anything so truly fearful !\" \" Ob, my young friend,\" added March dale, '\u2022 if anything could add to the pangs which all who love, and admire, and respect Flora Bannerworth must feel at the un happy condition in which sbe is placed, it would be the noble nature of you, who, under happier auspices, would have been her guide through life, and the happy partner of her destiny.\" \" As I will be stUl.\" Charles and Henry were both silent ; in truth, they knew not what to think, and tbe words uttered by Marchdale were too strikingly true to dispute sor a moment. They were lost in wonder. \" Human means against snch an appear ance as we saw to-night,\" said Charles, \" are evidenly useless.\" '* My dear young friend,\" said March dale, with much emotion, as he grasped Henry Bannerworth's band, and the tears stood in his eyes as he did so \u2014 \" My dear young friend, these constant alarms wUl kiU you.

You must control these dreadful feelings, and there is but one chance that I can see of getting now the better of them.\" \" What is that?\" \"May Heaven forbid it ! We are now among ourselves, and can talk freely upon such a subject.

Say you meant no offence to my mother's old friend.\" \" If to say I meant no offence,\" said Charles, \" ia to say I meant no insult, I say it freely.\" \u2022'Enough,\" cried Marchdale: \"I am satisfied.\" It wUl be remembered that Flora had fired a pistol at the spectral appearance, and that immediately upon that it had disappeared, after uttering a sound which might well be construed into a cry of pain i from a wound. \"Bnt do not,\" added Charles, \"draw me any more such pictures as the one you have already presented to my imagination, I beg of you. From the storehouse of my own fancy, I can find quite enough to make me wretched, if I choose to be so. But again and again do I say I wiU not aUow this monstrous superstition to tread me down, like the tread of a giant on a broken reed. I wUl contend against it whUe I bave life to do so.\" That a wound, then, had been inflicted npon some one, the blood beneath the win dow now abundantly testified ; and when it was discovered, Henry and Charles made a very close examination, indeed, of the garden, to discover what direction the wounded figure, be it man or vampyre, had taken. But the closest scrutiny did not reveal to them a single spot of blood, beyond the space immediately beneath the window;\u2014 there the apparition seemed to have re ceived its wound, and then, by some mys terious means, to have disappeared. At length, weared with the continued excitement, combined with want of sleep, to which they had been subjected, they re turned to the hall. \" Bravely spoken.\" \"And when I desert Flora Banner worth, may Heaven, from that moment, desert me !\" \" Charles !\" cried Henry, with emotion, \"dear Charles\u2014 my more than friend brother of my heart\u2014 noble Charles 1\" \" Nay, Henry, I am not entitled to your praises.

Whether or not she believed this kind deceit they knew not. She only sighed"], [65, "VARNEY, THE VAMPTRE ; OR, THE FEAST OF BLOOD. 55 deeply, and wept. The probability is, that she more than suspected the vampyre had made another visit, but they forebore to press the point ; and leaving her with her mother, Henry and George went from her chamber again\u2014 the former to endeavour to seek some repose, as it would be his turn to watch on the succeeding night, and the latter to resume his station in a small room close to Flora's chamber, where it had been agreed watch and ward should be kept by turns whUe the alarm lasted. At length, the morning again dawned upon that unhappy family, and to none were its beams more welcome. The birds sang their pleasant carols be neath the window. The sweet, deep coloured autumnal sun shone upon aU ob- jects with a golden lustre ; and to look abroad, upon the beaming face of nature, no one could for a moment suppose, ex cept from sad experience, that there were such things as gloom, misery, and crime, upon the earth. \"And must I,\" said Henry, as he gazed from the window of the hall upon the un dulating park, the majestic trees, the flowers, the shrubs, and the many natural beauties with which the place was full, \u2014 '\u25a0must I be chased from this spot, the home of myself and of my kindred, by a phantom \u2014 must I indeed seek refuge else where, because my own home has become hideous?\" a a painful I was one he not, I be ne- H cessary. now the sun was shining: I was morning; and the feelings which | found a home in his breast amid the dark- and those which oppressed the heart of ness, the stillness, and the uncertainty of Henry Bannerworth were considerably night, were chased away by those glorious modified. beams of sunlight, that fell upon hill, He was engaged in these reflections when valley, and stream, and the thousand sweet he heard the sound of the lodge-bell, and sounds of life and animation that filled that as a visitor was now somewhat rare at this sunny air! establishment, he waited with some anxiety Such a revulsion of feeling was natural to see to whom he was indebted for so early enough.

She could find no other ground for quarrel than what was connected with the vampyre, and, as Henry would not quarrel with her on such a score, she was compelled to give it up in despair. When Henry found himself alone, aud free from the annoyance of this woman, he turned his attention to the letter he held in lr:s hnnd, and which, from the autograph in the corner, he knew came from his new neighbour, Sir Francis Varney, whom, by \" To Henry Bannerworth, Esq.\" Henry, after having read this most un objectionable letter through, folded it up again, and placed it in his pocket.

He walked to and fro for nearly an hour, until he heard a hasty foot- step approaching him, and upon looking in the direction from whence it came, he saw Mr. Marchdale. \" I wiU seek Marchdale's advice,\" he said, \" upon this mat'er. I wiU hear what he says concerning it.\" \" Henry,\" said Marchdale, when he came sufficiently near to him for conversation, \" why do you remain here alone?\" \" I have received a communication from our neighbour, Sir Francis Varney,\" said Henry. \"Indeed!\" \" It is here. Peruse it for yourself, and then tell me, Marchdale, candidly what you think of it.\" \"I suppose,\" said Marchdale, as he opened the letter, \" it is another friendly note of condolence on the state of your do- mestic affairs, which, I grieve to say, from the prattling of domestics, whose tongues it is quite impossible to sUence, have be- come food for gossip all over the neigh- bouring viUage and estates.\" ' \"If anything could add another pang to those I bave already been made to suffer,\" said Henry, \"it would certainly arise from being made the food of vulgar gossip. But read the letter, Marchdale. You wUl find its contents ofa more important character than you anticipate.\" \" Indeed !\" said Marchdale, as he ran his eyes eagerly over the note. When he had finished it he glanced at Henry, who then said, \u2014 \"Well, what is your opinion?\" \"I know not what to say, Henry. You know that my own advice to you has been to get rid of this place.\" \"It has.\" \" I am sure you should not,\" said Henry, \"when you speak of me.\" \"Well \u2014 well; let us hope that the time may not be very far distant when I may use the term happy, as applied to you, in the most conclusive and the strongest manner it can be used.\" \"-Oh,\" said Henry, \" I will hope ; but do not mock me with it now, Marchdale, I pray you.\" \"Heaven forbid that I should mock you !\" \" WeU \u2014 weU ; I do not beUeve you are the man to do so to any one.

They shall decide.\" \"With the hope that the disagreeable affair connected with it now may remain connected with it as a house, and not with you and yours as a family.\" \"It may be so.\" \" There appears to me every likelihood of it.\" Mr. Marchdale now strove, in every pos sible manner, to raise the spirits of Henry Bannerworth, by painting to him the future in far more radiant colours than the pre sent, and endeavouring to induce a belief in his mind that a 6hoit period of time might after all replace in his mind, and iu the minds of those who were naturally so dear to him, all their wonted serenity. \" I do not know,\" said Henry, with a shudder. \" I must confess, Marchdale, that to my own perceptions it seems more pro bable that the infliction we have experienced from the strange visitor, who seems now re solved to pester us with visits, will rather"], [68, "VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE ; Oft, 58 \" Henry, although he felt not much com fort from these kindly efforts, yet could feel gratitude to him who marie them; and after expressing such a seeling to March dale, in strong terms, he repaired to the house, in order to hold a solemn consulta tion with those whom he felt ought to be consulted, as weU as himself, as to what steps should be taken with regard to the Hall. The proposition\u2014 or, rather, the sugges tion\u2014which had been made by Marchdale, upon the proposition ot Sir Francis Var ney, was in every respect so reasonable and just, that it met, as was to be ex pected, with the concurrence of every member of the family. Flora's cheeks almost resumed some of their wonted colour at the mere thought now of leaving tbat home to which she had been at one time so much attached. \" Yes, dear Henry,\" she said, \" let us leave here, if you are agreeable so to do; and in leaving this house, we will believe that we leave behind us a world of terror.\" \"Flora,\" remarked Henry, in a tone of sUght reproach, \" if you were so anxious to leave Bannerworth HaU, why did you not say so before this proposition came from other mouths ?

The estate which had been so recently entered upon by the person calling himself Sir Francis Varney, and which common report said he had purchased, was a small, but complete property, and situated so close to the grounds connected with Bannerworth Hall, that a short walk soon placed Henry and Mr. Marchdale before the residence of this gentleman, who had shown so kindly a feeling towards the Bannerworth famUy. \" Have you seen Sir Francis Var\u00bbey ?\" asked Henry of Mr. Marchdale, as he rung the gate-bell. \" I have not. Have you?\" \"No, I never saw him. It is rather awkward our both being absolute strangers to his person.\" \" We can but send in our names, how ever; and, from the great vein of courtesy that runs through his letter, I have no doubt but we shall receive the most gen tlemanly reception from him.\" A servant in handsome livery appeared at the iron-gates, which opened upon a lawn in the front of Sir Francis Varney's house, and to this domestic Henry Banner worth handed his card, on which he had written, in pencil, Ukowise the name ot Mr. Marchdale. \" I knew you were attached to the old house,\" said Flora ; \" and, besides, events have come upon us all with such fearful rapidity, that there has scarcely been time to think.\" \" If your master,\" he said, \" is within, we shall be glad to see him.\" \"Sir Francis is at home, sir,\" was the reply, \"although not very welL If you will be pleased to walk in, I will announce you to him.\" Henry and Marchdale followed the man into a handsome-enough reception-room, where they were desired to wait while their names were announced. \" True\u2014 true.\" \" And you wiU leave, Henry?\" \"I wiU caU upon Sir Francis Varney my self, and speak to him upon the subject.\" A new impetus to existence appeared now to come over the whole family, at the idea of leaving the place which always would be now associated in their minds with so much terror. Each member of the family felt happier, and breathed more freely than before, so that the change which had come over them seemed almost magical. And Charles HoUand, too, was much better pleased, and he whispered to Flora\u2014 \" Do you know if this gentleman be a baronet,\" said Henry, \"or a knight merely ?\" \" I really do not ; I never saw him in my life, or heard of him before he' came into this neighbourhood.\" \" And I have been too much occupied with the painful occurrences at the hall to know anything of our neighbours.

Henry sunk into the chair which was near him, and he trembled violently. The rush of painful thoughts and conjectures that came through his mind was enough to make any one tremble. \" Is this the vampyre?\" was the horrible .question that seemed impressed upon his very brain, in letters of flame, \"Is this the vampyre?\" \"Are you better, sir?\" said Sir Francis Varney gave a twinge of pain, as if some sudden bodUy ailment had attacked him severely. \" Yoo are unwell, sir,\" said Marchdale. \"No\u2014 oh, no,\" he said; \"I hurt my arm, and happened accidentaUy to touch the arm of this chair with it.\" \" A hurt?\" said Henry. \u00ab' Yes, Mr. Banner w orth.\""], [70, "VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE; OR, 60 I CHAPTER XIV. henry's AGREEMENT WITH SIK FRANCIS VARNEY.\u2014 THE SJJODEN ARRIVAL AT THE HALL. \u2014 FLORA'S ALARM. \"A\u2014 a wound?\" \" Yes, a wound, but not much more than tkin deep.

The scenery is remarkable for its beauty, and, from what I have seen of it, it is rarely to be excelled.

Henry looked in his face again, from which he had only mometarily withdrawn his eyes, and he was then more struck than ever with the resemblance between him and the portrait on the panel of what bad been Flora's chamber. What made that resemblance, too, one about which there could scarcely be two opinions, was the mark or cicatrix of a wound in the fore head, which the painter had slightly in- dented in the portrait, but which was much more plainly visible on the forehead of Sir Francis Varney. Now that Henry observed this distinctive mark, which he had not done before, he could feel no doubt, and a sickening sensation came over him at the thought that he was ac- tually now in the presence of one of those terrible creatures, vampyres. \" You do not drink,\" said Varney. \" Most young men are not so modest with a decanter of unimpeachable wine before them.

While those matters of most grave and serious import were going on at the HaD, whde each day, and almost each hour in each day, was producing more and more conclusive evidence upon a matter which at first had seemed too monstrous to be at aU credited, it may weU be supposed what a wonderful sensation was produced among the gossip-mongers of the neighbourhood by the exaggerated reports that had reached them. \" It has often been my misfortune through life,\" said Mr. Marchdale, sadly, \" to give the greatest offence where I feel the truest friendship, because it is in such quarters that I am always tempted to speak too freely.\" \" Nay, no offence,\" said Henry. \" I am distracted, and scarcely know what I say. Marchdale, I know you are my sincere friend; but, as I tell you, I am nearly mad.\" The servants, who had left the Hall on no other account, as they declared, but sheer fright at the awful visits of the vam pyre, spread the news far and wide, so that in the adjoining villages and market-towns the vampyre of Bannerworth HaU became quite a staple article of conversation. \" My dear Henry, be calmer. Consider upon what is to be said concerning this in terview at home.\" Such a positive godsend for the lovers of the marveUous had not appeared in the country side within the memory of that sapient individual\u2014 the oldest inhabitant. And, moreover, there was one thing which staggered some people of better education and maturer judgments, and that was, that the more they took pains to inquire into the matter, in order, if possi ble, to put an end to what they considered a gross Ue from the commencement, the more evidence they found to stagger their own senses upon the subject.

He was hearty-looking, and well dressed, and evidently well fed. As the chaise drove up to the door ofthe inn, this man made an observation to the other to the following effect\u2014 \"A-hoy!\" that Marchdale and Henry made their visit to Sir Francis Varney, that a post chaise drew up to the inn we have men tioned.

As for Flora, Heaven only knows if at that precise time her inteUect had com pletely stood the test of the trying events which had nearly overwhelmed it. The two grand feelings that seemed to possess her mind we\u00bbe fear for the renewed visits ofthe vampyre, and an earnest desire to release Charles HoUand from his re peated vows of constancy towards her.

To link him to her fate, would be to make him to a real extent a sharer in it, and the more she heard faU from his lips in the way of generous feel ings of continued attachment to her, the more severely did she feel that he would suffer most acutely if united to her. And she was right. The very generosity of feeling which wonld have now prompted Charles Holland to lead Flora Banner worth to the altar, even with the marks of the vampyre's teeth upon her throat, gave an assurance of a depth of feeUng which would have made him an ample haven in all her miseries, in all her distresses and Jack opened the window to discharge the superfluous moisture from an enormous quid he had indulged himself with whUe the lawyer was telUng about the vampyre, and then again turning his face towards his master, he said \u2014 \"Do?

What was familiarly in the family at the Hall caUed the garden, was a semicircular piece of ground shadted in several direc tions by trees, and which was exclusively devoted to the growth of flowers. The piece of ground was nearly hidden from the view of the bouse, and in its centre was a summer-house, which at the usual season of the year was covered with aU kinds ol creeping plants of exquisite perfumes, and with a variety of conflicting feelings, and he passed the intermediate time in a most painful state of doubt as to what would be its result. The thought that he should be much urged by Flora to give up all thoughts of making hei' his, was a most bitter one to"], [80, "VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE. 70 She could not speak. Her heart was too full of woe. \" Oh, Flora, my own, my beautiful,\" he added, in those tones which como so direct from the heart, and which are so different from any assumption of tenderness. \"Speak to me, dear, dear Flora\u2014 speak to me if it be but a word.\" \" Charles,\" was all she could say, and then she burst into a flood of tears, and leant so heavily npon his arm, that it was evident but for that support she must have fallen. Charles Holland welcomed those tears, although they grieved him so much that he could bave accompanied them with his own, but then he knew she would be soon now more composed, and that they would relieve the heart whose sorrows called them into existence. rare beauty. All around, too, bloomed the fairest and sweetest of flowers, whicb a rich sod and a sheltered situation could produce. Alas! though, of late many weeds had straggled np among their more estimable floral culture, for the decayed fortunes of the family had prevented them from keep ing the necessary servants, to place the Hall and its grounds in a state of neatness, such as it had once been the pride of the inhabitants of the place to see them. It was then in this flower-garden that Charles and Flora used to meet. As may be supposed, he was on thespot before the appointed hour, anxiously ex pecting the appearance of her who was so reaUy and truly dear to bim. What to him were the sweet flowers that grew in snch luxuriance and heedless beauty ? Alas, the flower that to his mind was fairer than them aU, was blighted, and in the wan cheek of her whom he loved, he sighed to see the lily usurping the place of the radi ant rose. He forbore to speak to hernntil he found this sudden gush of feeling was subsiding into sobs, and then in low, soft accents, he again endeavoured to breathe comfort to her afflicted and terrified spirit. \"My Flora,\" he said, \"remember that there are warm hearts that love you. Re member tbat neither time nor circumstance can change such endearing affection as mine. Ah, Flora, what evil is there in the whole world that love may not conquer, and in the height of its noble feelings laugh to scorn? \" Oh, hush, hush, Charles, hnsh.\" \" Wherefore, Flora, would you stiU the voice of pure affection ? I love you surely, as few have ever loved.

He might have couched it in pleasanter words \u2014 words that would not, like daggers, each have brought a deadly pang home to my heart; but still I do think that in his conclusion he was right.\" A light sound, as of some fairy footstep among the flowers, came upon his ears, and turning instantly to the direction from whence the sound proceeded, he saw what his heart had previously assured him of, namely, that it was his Flora who was coming. Yes, it was she; but, ah, how pale, how wan \u2014 how languid and full of the evi dences of much mental suffering was she. Where now was the elasticity of that youth ful step? Where now was that lustrous beaming beauty of mirthfulness, which was wont to dawn in those eyes ? Alas, all was changed. The exquisite beauty of form was there, but the light of joy which had lent its most transcendent charms to that heavenly face, was gone. Charles was by her side in a moment. He had her hand clasped in his, while his dis engaged one was wound tenderly around her taper waist. \"Flora, dear, dear Flora,\" he said, \"you are better. Tell me that you feel the gentle air revives you?\" \" No \u2014 no\u2014 no.\" \"Flora, Flora, wherefore do yon say no?\" '\u2022 Do not, Charles, now speak to me of affection or love.

Their appearance showed that they had made haste, and Henry at once exclaimed\u2014 \" We heard, or fancied we heard, a cry of alarm.\" \"You did hear it,\" said Charles Hol land. \" Do you know this gentleman?\" \" It is Sir Francis Varney.\" \" Indeed !\" \" Oh, it is terrible to meet him here.\" \"And he is so wonderfully anxious, too, to possess the Hall.\" \"He is \u2014 be is.\" \" It looks strange, tbe whole affair. But, Flora, be assured of one thing, and that is, of your own safety.\" \" Can I be assured of that?\" \u25a0 Most certainly. Go to your mother now. Here we are, you see, fairly within doors. Go to your mother, dear Flora, and keep yourself quiet. I wiU return to this mysterious man now with a cooler judg ment than I left him.\" \" You wiU watch him, Charles?\" Varney bowed to the new comers, and was altogether as much at bis ease as every body else seemed quite the contrary. Even Charles Holland sound the difficulty of going up to such a well-bred, gentlemanly man, and saying \u2014 \" Sir, we believe you to be a vampyre\u2014 to be almost, if not insur mountable.\" \" I cannot do it,\" he thought ; \"bnt I wiU watch him.\" \" I will, indeed.\" \" And you wUl not let him approach the house here alone?\" \" I wUl not\" \" Ob, that the Almighty should allow such beings to haunt the earth !\" \" Hush, Flora, hush ! we cannot judge of his aUwise purpose.\" \" 'Tis hard that tho innocent should be inflicted with its presence.\" \"Take me away,\" whispered Flora. \"'Tis he\u2014 'tis he. Oh, take me away, Charles.\" Charles bowed his head in mournful assent. \" Is it not very, very dreadful?\" \" Hush \u2014 hush ! Calm yourself, dearest, calm yourself. Recollect that all we have to go upon in this matter is a resemblance, which, after all, may be accidental. Bnt leave it all to me, and be assured that now I have some clue to this affair, I will not lose sight of it, or of Sir Francis Varney.\" So saying, Charles surrendered Flora to the care of her mother, and then was has tening back to the summer-house, when he met the whole party coming towards the HaU, for the rain was each moment increas ing in intensity. \" Hush, Flora, hush. You are in some error ; the accidental resemblance should not make us be rude to this gentleman.\" \"The vampyre ! \u2014 it is the vampyre !\" \"Are you sure, Flora?\" \" Do I know your features \u2014 my own \u2014 my brothers'? Do not ask me to doubt \u2014 I cannot. I am quite sure. Take me from his hideous presence, Charles.\" \" The young lady, I fear, is very much indisposed,\" remarked Sir Francis Varney, in a sympathic tone of voice. \" If she wUl accept of my arm, I shall esteem it a great honour.\" \"No\u2014 no\u2014 no ! \u2014God ! no,\" cried Flora. \"We are returning,\" remarked Sir Francis Varney, with a half-bow and a smUe, to Charles. \" AUow me,\" said Henry, \" to introduce you, Mr. Holland, to om- neighbour, Sir Francis Varney.\" Charles felt himself compolled to behave with courtesy, although his mind was so full of conflicting feelings as regarded Var ney ; but there was no avoiding, without such brutal rudeness as was inconsistent with all his pursuits and habits, replying in something like tbe same strain to the ex treme courtly poUteness of the supposed vampyre. \" Madam, I wUl not press you.\" He bowed, and Charles led Flora from the summer-house towards the hall. \"Flora,\" he said, \"I am bewildered \u2014 a know not what to think. That man most certainly has been fashioned after the portrait which is on the panel in the room you formerly occupied ; or it has been painted from him.\" \" He is my midnight visitor !\" exclaimed Flora. \"He is the vampyre ;\u2014 this Sir Francis Varney is the vampyre.\" \"Good God ! What can be done?\" \" I know not. I am nearly distracted.\" \" Be calm, Flora. If this man be really what you name him, we now know from what quarter the mischief comes, which is, at all events, a point gained. Be assured we shaU place a watch upon him.\" \"I wiU watch him closely,\" thought Charles. \" I can do no more than watch him closely.\" Sir Francis Varney seemed to be a man of the most general and discursive informa tion. He talked fluently and pleasantly upon all sorts of topics, and not withstand'"], [85, "THE FEAST OF BLOOD. 75 ing he couldnotbut have heard what Flora had said of him, he asked no questions whatever upon that subject. This silence as regarded a matter which would at once have induced some sort of inquiry from any other man, Charles felt told much against him, and he trembled to beUeve for a moment that, aster all, it reaUy might be true. \" Is he a vampyre?\" he asked himself. \" Are there vampyres, and is this man of fashion \u2014 this courtly, talented, educated gentleman, one?\" It was a perfectly hideous question. \" You are charmingly situated here,\" re marked Varney, as, after ascending the few steps that led to the hall door, he turned and looked at the view from that slight altitude. tioned to me that there was a portrait here amazingly like me.\" \"Did I?\" \" Indeed you did, or how could I know it? I wanted to see if the resemblance was so perfect.\" \" Did you hear, sir,\" added Henry, \" that my sister was alarmed at your likeness to that portrait?\" \" No, really.\" \" I pray you walk in, and we wiU talk more at large upon that matter.\" \"With great pleasure. One leads a monotonous life in the country, when com pared with tho brilliancy of a court exist ence. Just now I have no particular en gagement As we are near neighboHi-s I see no reason why we should not be good friends, and often interchange such civili ties as make up the amenities of existence, and which, in the country, more particu larly, are valuable.\" Henry could not be hypocrite enough to assent to this ; but still, under tbe present aspect of affairs, it was impossible to return any but a civil reply ; so he said \u2014 \" Ob, yes, of course\u2014 certainly . My time is very much occupied, and my sister and mother see no company.\" \" Oh, now, how wrong.\" \" Wrong, sir?\" \" Yes, surely. If anything more than another tends to harmonize individuals, it is the society of that fairer half of the creation which we love for their very foibles. I am much attached to thc softer sex \u2014 to young persons full of health. I like to see the rosy cheeks, where the warm blood mantles in the superficial veins, aud nil is loveliness and life.\" \" The place has been much esteemed,\" said Henry, \" for its picturesque beauties of scenery.\" \" And weU it may be. I trust, Mr. Hol land, the young lady is much better?\" \" She is, sir,\" said Charles. \"1 was not honoured by an introduction.\" \" It was my fault,\" said Henry, who spoke to his extraordinary guest with an air of forced hilarity. \" It was my fault for not introducing you to my sister.\" \"And that was your sister?\" \" It was. sir,\" \" Report has not behed her\u2014 she is beau tiful. Bat she looks rather pale, I thought. Has she bad health ':\" \" The best of health.\" \" Indeed ! Perhaps the little disagree able circumstance, which is made so much food for gossip in the neighbourhood, has affected her spirits.\" \"It has.\" Charles shrank back, and the word \" Demon\" unconsciously escaped his lips. Sir Francis took no manner of notice of the expression, but went on talking, as if he had been on the very happiest terms with every one present. \" Will you follow me, at once, to the chamber where the portrait hangs,\" said Henry, \" or will you partake of some re freshment first?\" \" You aUude to the supposed visit here of a vampyre?\" said Charles, as he fixed his eyes upon Varney's face. \"Yes, I allude to the supposed appear ance of a supposed vampyre in this family,\" said Sir Francis Varney, as he returned the earnest gaze of Charles, with such un shrinking assurance, that the young man was compelled, after about a minute nearly, to withdraw his own eyes. \" I Ie will not be cowed,\" thought Charles. \"Use has made him familiar to such crois questioning.\" \" No refreshment for me,\" said Varney. \" My dear friend, if you will permit me to call you such, this is a time of the day at which I never do take any refreshment.\" \" Nor at any other,\" thought Henry. They all went to the chamber where Charles had passed one very disagreeable night ; and when they arrived, Henry pointed to the portrait on the panel, say ing\u2014 It appeared now suddenly to occur to Henry that he had said something at Var ney's own honse which should bave pre vented him from coming to the HaU, and he now remarked \u2014 \" We scarcely expected the pleasure of your company here, Sir Francis Varney.\" \" Oh, my d*r\u00bb \u2022nr, I am aware of that ; but you routed k./ Kiriosity.

' I like to see young persons enthusiastic ; ! I it looks as if they had some of the real fire ' i of genius in their composition. Bravo\u2014 j bravo !\" This was, Charles thought, the very j height and acme of impudence ; and yet what conld he do? What could he say? I He was foUed by the downright coolness of Varney. As for Henry, George, and Mr. March- dale, they had listened to what was passing between Sir Francis and Charles in silence. , They feared to diminish the effect of any- il thing Charles might say by adding a word i' of their own ; and, likewise, they did not R wish to lose one observation that might ! come from the lips of Varney. But now Charles appeared to have said all he had to say, and turned to the window and looked out. He seemed Uke a man who had made up his mind, sor a time, to j give up some contest in which he had been '. engaged. And, perhaps, not so much did he give | it np from any feeling or consciousness of being beaten as from a conviction that it I could be the more effectually, at some ; other and far more eligible opportunity, j renewed. \" He is beneath my roof now, and, after all, it is but a hideous suspicion we have of him.\" \"Rely upon me.\" Charles stepped forward, and once again confronting Varney with an earnest gaze, he said \u2014 Varney now addressed Henry, saying\u2014 j \"I presume the subject of our con ference, when you did me the honour of a call, is no secret to any one here?\" \" None whatever,\" said Henry. \" Then, perhaps, I am too early in ask ing you if you have made up your mind?\" \" I have scarcely, certainly, had time to think.\" \" My dear sir, do not let me hurry you: I I much regret, indeed, the intrusion.\" \" You seem anxious to possess the HaU,' remarked Mr. Marchdale to Varney. \"lam.\" \" Do you know, sir, that Miss Banner worth declares the vampyre she fancies to have visited this chamber to be, in features, the exact counterpart of this portrait?\" \" Does s\"he, indeed?\" \" She does, indeed.\" \" And, perhaps, then, that accounts for her thinking that I am the vampyre, be cause I bear a strong resemblance to the potrait.\" \" I should not be surprised,\" said Charles. \"How very odd!\" \" Very.\" \"And yet entertaining. I am rather amused than otherwise. The idea of being a vampyre ! Ha, ha! If ever I go to a masquerade again, I shaU certainly assume the character of a vampyre.\" \" You would do it well.\" \"Is it new to you?\" \" Not quite. I have some boyish recol- , lections connected with this neighbour hood, among which Bannerworth Hall stands sufficiently prominent.\" \" May I ask how long ago that was ?\" said Charles Holland, rather abruptly. \"I do not recollect, my enthusiastic young friend,\" said Varney. \" How old are you?\" \" Just abont twenty-one.\" \" Yon are, then, for your age, quite a : model of discretion.\" \" I dare say, now, I should make quite a sensation.\" \"I am certain you would. Do you not think, gentlemen, that Sir Francis Varney would enact the character to the very life? By heavens, he would do it so well that one might, without much difficulty, reaUy imagine him a vampyre.\" \" Bravo \u2014 bravo !\" said Varney, as he gently folded his hands together with that genteel applause that may even be indulged in in a box at the opera itself. \" Bravo ! It wonld have been difficult ser the most j pccurate observer of human nature to have decided whether this was said truthfully or ironically, so Charles made no reply to it ' whatever. \" I trust,\" said Henry, \" we shall induce you, as this is your first visit, Sir Francis"], [87, "THE FEAST OF BLOOD. 77 Varney, the to Hall, to partake of some- thing.\" \" WeU, well\u2014 a cup of wine\u2014\" \"Is at your service.\" Henry now led the way to a smaU par 1 lour, which, although by no means one of i the showiest rooms of the house, was, from the care and exquisite carving with which Unbounded, much more to the taste of any who possessed an accurate judgment in such works of art.

Who it could have been that so far intermeddled with his affairs as to twenty-two, Charles HoUand should travel, inasmuch as in English society he would find himself in an awkward position, being for one whole year of age, and yet waiting for his property. Under such circumstances, reasoned the lawyer, a young man, unless he is pos sessed of very rare discretion indeed, is almost sure to get fearfuUy involved with money-lenders. Being of age, his notes, and bUls, and bonds would all be good, and he would be in a ten times worse situation than a wealthy minor. AU this was duly explained to Charles, who rather eagerly than otherwise caught at the idea of a two years wander on the continent, where he could visit so many places, which to a weU-read young man like himself, and one of a Uvely imagina tion, were fuU of the most delightful asso ciations. But the acquaintance with Flora Banner- worth effected a great revolution in his feelings. The dearest, sweetest spot on earth became that wbich she inhabited. When the Bannerworths left him abroad, he knew not what to do with himself. Everything, and every pursuit in which he had before taken a deUght, became most distasteful to him. He was, in fact, in a short time, completely \"used up,\" and then he determined upon returning to England, and finding out the dear object of his attachment once more. This reso- lution was no sooner taken, than his health and spirits returned to him, and with what rapidity he conld, he now made his way to his native shores. The two years were so nearly expired, tbat he made up his mind he would not communicate either with his uncle, the admiral, or the professional gentleman upon whose judgment he set so high aud so just a value. And at the Hall he considered he was in perfect security from any interrup- tion, and so he would have been, but for that letter which was written to Admiral Bell, and signed Josiah Crinkles, but which Josiah Crinkles so emphatically denied all knowledge of. Who wrote it, remains at present one of those mysteries which time, in the progress of our narrative, wUl clear up. The opportune, or rather the painful juncture at which Charles HoUand had arrived at Bannerworth Hall, we are well cognisant of. Where he expected to find r-mileB be found tears, and the family with whom he had fondly hoped he should pass a time of uninterrupted happiness, he found plunged in the gloom incidental to an oc- currence of the most painful character. Our readers wUl perceive, too, that write to him, he could not possibly con ceive. A very few words will suffice to explain [ the precise position in which Charles Hol- land was. A considerable sum of money had been left to him, but it was saddled with the condition that he should not come into possession of it until he was one year btjyond the age which is usually denomi- nated that of discretion, namely, twenty- one. His uncle, the admiral, was the trus- tee of his fortune, and he, with rare dis- cretion, had got the active and zealous assistance of a professional gentleman of great honour and eminence to conduct the business lor him. This gentleman bad advised that for the ' two years between the ages of twenty and"], [92, "VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE ; OR, 82 I \" Give that to her : it contains an account ofa wild adventure, and shows that human nature may suffer much more \u2014 and that wrongfully too \u2014 than came ever under our present mysterious affliction.\" \" I will,\" said Henry ; \" and, coming from yon, I am sure it will have a more than ordinary value in her eyes.\" \" I wiU now,\" said Charles, \" seek my uncle.

Charles now took an opportunity to speak to Henry privately, and inform him exactly how he stood with his ancle, ad- ding \u2014 \" Now, my dear friend, if you forbid me, I wUl not tell my uncle of this sad affair ; but I must own I would rather do so fuUy and freely, and trust to his own judgment upon it.\" \" I implore you to do 60,\" 6aid Henry. \" Conceal notMng.

She has related to me something of a meeting she had with you.\" \" Ob, Henry, she may teU you what I said ; but there are no words which can express the depth of my tenderness. 'Tis only time which can prove how much I love her.\" \"You are partial, Charles.\" \" Not so.

No doubt, he wiU not be at aU averse to an interview with any one who stands high in your esteem.\" The young men now separated \u2014 Henry, to seek his beautiful sister ; and Charles to communicate to his uncle the strange particulars connected with Varney, the Vampyre.

She opened the door in an instant, and, with a feeUng of gratefdf relief, ex claimed \u2014 \" Oh, Henry, is it only you?\" \" Who did you suppose it was, Flora?\" She shuddered. \" I\u2014 I \u2014 do not know ; bnt I am so fool-"], [93, "THE FEAST OF BLOOD. 83 ish now, and so weak-spirited, that the sUghtest noise is enough to alarm me.\" \" You must, dear Flora, fight np, as I had hoped you were doing, against this nervousness.\" \" I wUl endeavour.

He loves me \u2014 he loves me !\" The very repitition of these words had a charm for Flora \u2014 a charm which was suffi cient to banish much sorrow ; even the much-dreaded vampyre was forgotten while the light of love was beaming upon her, and she told herself \u2014 \" He is mine ! \u2014 he is mine t He loves me truly.\" After a time, she turned to the manu script which her brother had brought her, and, with a fer greater concentration of mind than she had thought it possible she could bring to it, considering the many painful subjects of contemplation that she might have occupied herself with, she read the pages with very great pleasure and interest. \"And to advise him,\" said Flora, as she sunk into a chair, and wept bitterly; \"to advise him, of course, to desert, as he wonld a pestilence, a vampyre bride.\" \" Hush\u2014 hush ! for the sake of Heaven, never make use of such a phrase, Flora.

It commenced as follows, and was entitled, \" Hugo de Verole ; or, the Double Plot.\" In a very mountainous part of Hungary lived a nobleman whose paternal estates covered many a mile of rock and moun tain land, as weU as some fertile valleys, in which reposed a hardy and contented peasantry. The old Count de Hugo de Verole had quitted Use early, and had lest his only son, the then Count Hugo de Verole, a boy of scarcely ten years, under the guardianship of his mother, an arbitrary and unscru pulous woman. The count, her husband, had been one of those quiet even-tempered men, who have no desire to step beyond the sphere in which they are placed ; he had no cares, save those included in the management of his estate, the prosperity of his serfs, and the happiness of those around him. \"As Heaven is my judge, I do.\" \"Then I wiU bear upwith what strength God may give me against all things that seek to depress me ; I will not be con quered.\" \" You are right, Flora ; I rejoice to find in you such a disposition. Here is some manuscript which Charles thinks will amuse you, and he bade me ask you if you would be introduced to his uncle.\" His death caused much lamentation throughout his domains, it was so sudden and unexpected, being in the enjoyment ol his health and strength nntU a few hours previous, and then his energies became prostrated by pain and disease. There was a splendid funeral ceremony, whicb, according to the usages of his house, took place by torch-light. So great and rapid were the ravages of disease, that tbe count's body quickly be came a mass of corruption. All were amazed at the phenomena, and were hear tily glad when the body was disposed of in the place prepared sor its reception in the vaults of his own castle. The guests who came to witness the funeral, and attend the count's obsequies, and to condole with the widow on the loss she \" Yes, yes\u2014 wUUngly.\" \" I will tell him so ; I know he wishes it, and I will tell him so.

That night there came to the castle-gate a man dressed in a black coat, attended by a servant. They were both mounted on good horses, and they demanded to be admitted to the presence of the Countess de Hugo de Verole. The message was carried to the countess, who started, but said \u2014 \" Admit the stranger.\" Accordingly the stranger was admitted, and shown into the apartment where the countess was sitting. Ata signal the servants retired, leaving the countess and the stranger alone. It was some moments ere they spoke, and then the countess said in a low tone\u2014 The widow sustained her part well. She was inconsolable for the foss of her hus band, and mourned his death bitterly. Her grief appeared profound, but she, with difficulty, subdued it to within decent bounds, that she might not offend any of her numerous guests. However, they left her with the assur ances of their profound regard, and then when they were gone, when the last guest had departed, and were no longer visible to the eye of the countess, as she gazed from the battlements, then her behaviour changed totally. She descended from the battlements, and then with an imperious gesture she gave her orders that all the gates of the castle should be closed, and a watch set. All signs of mourning she ordered to be laid on one side save her own, which she wore, and then she retired to her own apartment, where she remained unseen. Here the countess remained in profound meditation for nearly two days, during which time tbe attendants beUeved she was praying for the welfare of the soul of their deceased master, and they seared she would starve herself to death if she remained any longer. Just as they had assembled together for the purpose of either recalling her from her vigUs or breaking open the door, they were amazed to see the countess open the room door, and stand in the midst of them, \" What do you here?\" she demanded, in a stern voice. \" You are come?\" \" I am come.\" \"You cannot now, you see, perform your threat. My husband, the count, caught a putrid disease, and he is no more.\" \"I cannot indeed do what I intended, inform your husband of your amours; but I can do something as good, and which wiU give you as much annoyance.\" \"Indeed.\" \" Ay, more, it will cause you tobe hated, I can spread reports.\" \" You can.\" \" And these may ruin you.\" \" They may.\" \" What do you intend to do?

I threatened, too, and he knew I was fully able and willing to per form any promise I might make to him on that score. I endeavoured to catch him, as he had already begun to set off on the suspicious and marvellous con cerning me, and if I could have come across him, I would have laid him very low in deed.\" \" No, indeed, I wUl take care of that.

But where is he?\" \"WiU you promise to be guided by me?\" said the countess. \" Indeed !\" \" Yes ; and my servant must be dis charged, as I want none here.\" The countess caUed to an attendant and gave the necessary orders, and afterwards remained some time with the stranger, who had thus so unceremoniously thrust himself upon her, and insisted npon stay ing under such strange and awful circum stances. \" If you make it a condition npon which you grant the information, I must.\" \" Well, then, I take that as a promise.\" \"Youmay.

That night, about an hoar before mid night, the Count Morven stole towards the phUosopher's room. He tapped at the door. \"Enter,\" said the philosopher. The count entered, and saw the philo sopher seated, and by him a lamp of pecu liar construction, and encased in gauze wire, and a cloak. \" Are yon ready ?\" inquired the count. -\" Quite,\" he replied. \"Is that your lamp?* \"It is.\" The count, seeing all secure, refastened the doors, and returned to the castle. A few weeks after this the body of a youth, mangled and disfigured, was brought to the castle, which the countess said was her son's body. The count had immediately secured the real heir, and thrust him into the mines, there to pass a Use of labour and hopeless misery. # # * * \u00bb \"Follow me, then, and hold the lamp tolerably high, as the way is strange, and the steps steep.\" \"Lead on.\" There was a high feast held.

This was on the occasion of tbe count and countess's marriage. It occurred many months after the death of her son, whom she affected to mourn for a long time. However, the marriage took place, and in all magnificence and splendour. The countess again appeared, arrayed in splen dour and beauty : she was proud and haughty, and tbe count was imperious. In the meantime, the yonng Count de Hngo de Verole was confined in the mines, and the doctor with him. The count and countess quitted Hun gary, and settled in Italy, where they Uved upon the remains of the Count of Morven's property, shorn of all their splendour, but enough to keep them from being compeUed to do any menial office. The young count took possession of his patrimony and his treasure at last, such as was left by his mother and her paramour. The doctor continued to hide his crime from the young count, and the perpetrators denying aU knowledge of it, he escaped ; but he returned to his native place, Leyden, with a reward for his services from the young count. Flora rose from her perusal of the manu script, which here ended; and even as she did so she heard a footstep approaching her chamber door. By a strange coincidence, the doctor and the young count became companions, and the former, meditating projects of revenge, educated the young count as weU as he was able for several years in the mines, and cherished in the young man a spirit of revenge. They finally escaped together, and proceeded to Leyden, where the doc tor had friends, and where he placed his pupU at the university, and thus made him a most efficient means ol revenge, because the education of the count gave him the means of appreciating the splendour and rank he had been deprived of.

The count and countess lived on in a state of regal sflendour. The immense revenue of his territory, and the treasure the late count bad amassed, as well as the revenue that the mines brought in, would have supported a much larger expenditure than even their tastes disposed them to enjoy. \" It is Hen- to conduct me to an interview with Charles's uncle,\" she said. \" I wonder, now, what manner of man he is. He should in some respects resemble Charles; and if he do so, I 6haU bestow upon him some affection for tbat alone.\" They had heard nothing of the escape of the doctor and the young count. Indeed, those who knew it held their pepee, and said nothing about it, for they feared the consequences of their negligence. The first intimation they received was at the hands of a state messenger, summoning them to deliver up the castle revenues and treasures of the late count. Tap \u2014 tap came upon the chamber-door. Flora was not at all alarmed now, as she had been when Henry brought her the manuscript. From some strange action of the nervous system, she felt quite confident, and resolved to brave everything. But then she felt quite sure that it was Henry, and before tbe knocking had taken her by surprise. \" Come in,\" she said, in a cheerful voice. \" Come in.\" This was astounding to them, and they \u2022\u2022efused to do so, but were soon after seized ron by a regiment of cuirassiers sent to r them, and they were accused of the crime of murder at the instance ol the doctor. They were arraigned, and found guUty; and as they were of the patrician order, their execution was delayed, and they were committed to exile. This was done out of favour to the young count, who did not wish to have bis famUy name tainted by a The door opened with wonderful swift ness \u2014 a figure stepped into the room, and then closed it rapidly, and stood against it.

There was a hideous and strange contor- tion of his face now, as he said \u2014 \" You are beautiful. The most cunning statuary might well model some rare work of art from those rounded limbs, that were surely made to bewitch the gazer. Your skin rivals the driven snow \u2014 what a face of loveliness, and what a form of enchant- ment !\" She did not speak, but a thought came across her mind, which at once crimsoned her cheek \u2014 she knew she had feinted on refused its office; a confused whirl of sen- sations passed through her brain \u2014 she trembled, and an icy coldness came over her. It was Sir Francis Varney, the vampyre ! He had drawn up his tall, gaunt frame to its full height, and crossed his arms upon his breast; there was a hideous smile upon his saUow countenance, and his voice was deep and sepulchral, as he said \u2014 \" Flora Bannerworth, hear that which I have to say, and hear it calmly. You need have nothing to fear. Make an alarm \u2014 scream, or shout for help, and, by the beU beneath us, you are lost!\" There was a death-like, cold, passionless manner about the utterance of these words, as if they were spoken mechanically, and came from no human lips. Flora heard them, and yet scarcely com- prehended them ; she stepped slowly back till she reached a chair, and there she held for support The only part of the address of Varney that thoroughly reached her ears, was that if she gave any alarm some dreadful consequences were to ensue. But it was not on account of these words that she really gave no alarm ; it was because she was utterly unable to do so. \"Answer me,\" said Varney. \"Promise that you wiU hear that which I have to say. In so promising you commit yourself to no evil, and you shall hear that which shall give you much peace.\" It was in vain she tried to speak; her lips moved, but she uttered no sound. \" You are terrified,\" said Varney, \"and yet I know not why.

I am something allied to humanity yet.\" \" Speak your errand,\" gasped Flora, \" or come what may, I scream for help to those who will not be slow to render it.\" \"I know it.\" \" You know I wiU scream?\" \"No; you wiU hear me. I know they would not be slow to render help to yoa, but you will not call for it; I wUl present to you no necessity.\" \" Say on \u2014 say on.\" \" You perceive I do not attempt to ap proach you ; my errand is one of peace.\" \" Peace from you ! Horrible being, if you be really what even now my appalled imagination shrinks from naming you, would not even to you absolute annihUa tion be a blessing?\" \" Peace, peace. I came not here to talk on such a subject. I must be brief, Flora Bannerworth, for time presses. I do not hate you. Wherefore should I? You are young, and you are beautiful, and you bear a name which should command, and does command, some portion of my best re gard.\" \"There is a portrait,\" said Flora, \"in this house.\" There was a pause of some moments' duration, and then, faintly, Flora managed to say \u2014 \" Help\u2014 help !

I have the means of knowing more of the secrets of the human heart than common men. I tell you, Flora Bannerworth, that he who talks to you of love, loves you not but with the fleeting \"I\u2014I hear,\" said Flora, as she still, dragging the chair with her, increased the distance between them. \" 'Tis well You are now more com posed.\" She fixed her eyes upon the face of Var ney with a shudder.

As he spoke, he moved from the door towards the window, which opened into a kitchen garden. Flora shrunk as far from him as possible, and for a few moments they regarded each other in sUence. \"Young blood,\" said Varney, \"mantles in your veins.\" She shuddered with terror. \" Be mindful of the condition I have proposed to you.

His voice sounded Uke music itself. His words flowed from his tongue, each gently and properly ac cented, with all the charm of eloquence. Despite her trembUng horror of that man \u2014 despite her fearful opinion, which might be said to amount to a conviction of what he really was, Flora felt an irresisti ble wish to hear him speak on. Ay, de spite, too, the ungrateful theme to her heart which be had now chosen asthe sub ject of his discourse, she felt her fear of him gradually dissipating; and now when he made a pause, she said \u2014 \" You are much mistaken. On the con stancy and truth of Charles HoUand, I would stake my life.\" \" No doubt\u2014 no donbt.\" \" Have you spoken now that which yon had to say?\" \" No\u2014 no. I teU yon I covet this place.

And the creditors took great credit to themselves that they allowed of such an arrangement, instead of sweeping off all before them, and leaving the family to starve. \u25a0**-\u25a0\u25a0\u00ab*'-\"\u2022\u25a0 \u2014 - cessity for do ing something of a decisive character was abundantly apparent, and when Henry promised Flora that her earnest wish to leave the house should not be forgotten as an element in tbe discussion which was about to ensue, it was with a rapidly grow ing feeling on his own part, to the effect tbat that house, associated even as it was with many endearing recollections, wasno home for him. The question, therefore, or, atallevents, one of the questions, now was, how far would a departure from the Hall of him, Henry, and the other branches Of the family, act upon that arrangement? During a very few minutes' considera tion, Henry, with the frank and candid disposition which was so strong a charac teristic of his character, made up his mind to explain all this fully to Charles Holland and his uncle. When once he formed such a determi nation he was not likely to be slow in car rying it into effect, and no sooner, then, were the whole of them seated in the small oaken parlour than he made an explicit statement of his circumstances. Hence he was the more inclined to pro pose a departure from tbe Hall if it could possibly be arranged satisfactorily in a pecuniary point of view. Tbe pecuniary point of view, however, in which Henry was compelled to look at the subject, was an important and a troublesome one"], [107, "THE FEAST OF BLOOD. 97 \" But,\" said Mr. Marchdale, when ho had done. \"I cannot see what right your creditors have to complain of where you live, 60 long as you perform your contract to them.\" \u00ab True ; but they always expected me, I know, to remain at the Hall, and if they chosej why, of course, at any time, they could sell off the whole of the property for what it would fetch, and pay themselves as far as the proceeds wonld go. At all events, I am quite certain there could be nothing at all left for me.\" \"I cannot imagine,\" added Mr. March dale, \"-that any men could be so unrea sonable.\" \" It is scarcely to be borne,\" remarked Charles Holland, with more impatience than he usually displayed, \" that a whole family are to be put to the necessity ot leaving their home for no other reason than the being pestered by such a neigh bour as Sir Francis Varney. It makes one impatient and angry to reflect upon such a state of thiDgs.\" \" And yet they are lamentably true,\" said Henry. \" What can we do?\" \" Surely there must be some sort of re medy.\" \"There is but one that I can imagine, and that is one we all alike revolt from. We might kill him.\" \" That is out of the question.\" \" Of course my impression is that he bears thc same name really as myself, and that he is my ancestor, from whom was painted the portrait on the panel.\" \" Have circumstances really so far pressed upon you,\" said Charles Holland, \"as at length to convince you that this man is really the horrible creature we sur mise he may be?\" \"Dare we longer doubt it?\" cried Henry, in a tone of excitement. \"Ha is the vampyre.\" \" I'll be hanged if I believe it, ' said Admiral Bell. \" Stuff and nonsense! Vam pyre, indeed! Bother the vampyre.\" \" Sir,\" said Henry, \" you have not had brought before you, painfully, as we have, all the circumstances upon which we, in a manner, feel compelled to found this hor rible belief. At first incredulity was a natural thing. We had no idea that ever we could bo brought to believe in such a thing.\" \" That is the case,\" added Marchdale. \" But, step by step, we have been driven from utter disbelief in this phenomenon to a trembling conviction tbat it must be true.\" \" Unless we admit that, simultaneously, the senses of a number of persons have \" That is scarcely possible.\" \" Then do you mean really to say there are such fish?\" said tho admiraL \" We think so.\" \"Well, I'm d\u2014 d! I have heard all sorts of yarns about what fellows have seen in one ocean and another; but this does beat them all to nothing.\" \"It is monstrous,\" exclaimed Charles. There was a pause of some few mo ments' duration, and then Mr. Marchdale said, in a low voice \u2014 \" Perhaps I ought not to propose any course of action until you, Henry, have yourself done so; but even at the risk of being presumptuous, I will say that I am firmly of opinion vou ought to leave the Hall.\" \" I am inclined to think so, too,\" said Henry. \" But the creditors?\" interposed Charles. \" I think they might be consulted on the matter beforehand,\" added Marchdale, \" when, no doubt, they would acquiesce in an arrangement which could do them no harm.\" \" Certainly, no harm,\" said Henry, \" for I cannot take the estate with me, as they well know.\" \" Precisely. If you do not like to sell it, you can let it.\" \"To whom?\" \"Why, under the existing circumstances, it is not likely you would get any tenant for it than tbe one who has offered him self.\" \" Sir Francis Varney?\" \" Yes. It seems to be a great object with him to live here, and it appears to me, that, notwithstanding all that hns oc curred, it is most decidedly the best policy to lot him.\" Nobody could really deny the reason ableness of tnis advice, although it seemed strange, and was repugnant to tho feelings ot them all, as they heard it. There was a pause of some seconds' duration, and then Henry said \u2014 \" It does, indeed seem singular, to sur render one's house to such a being.\" \"Especially,\" said Charles, \"after what has occurred.\" \" True.\" \" Well,\" said Mr. Marchdale, \" if any better plan of proceeding, taking the whole case into consideration, can be devised, I shall be most happy.\" \" Will you consent to put off all proceed ings for three days?\" said Charles Hol land, suddenly. \" Have you any plan, my dear sir?\" said Mr. Marchdale. \" I have, but it is one which I would been deceived.\""], [108, "98 VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE; OK, rather say nothing about for the pre sent.\" and George Binnerworth, accompanied by Mr. Chillingworth, came in. \" Do not let me intrude,\" said the sur geon; \" I fear, as I see you seated, gentle men, that my presence must be a rude ness and a disturbance to som-j family consultation among yourselves?\" '* Not at all, Mr. Chillingworth,\" said Henry. \"Pray be seated; we are very glad indeed to see you.

'* Now, Charles, I atn quite convinced that what I have hinted at is the fact. You have conceived some scheme which you fancy would be much oppjsed by us?\" \"I will not deny that I have,\" said Charles. \" It is one, however, which you must allow me for the present to keep locked in my own breast.\" \" Why will you not trust us?\" \" For t*.vo reasons.\" \" Indeed i\" \" The one is, that I have not yet thoroughly determined upon the course I projec'; and the other is, that it is one in which I am not justified in involving any one else.\" \" It would take much more to convince mo.

In the most respectful manner, he asked me to be seated, and when I had taken a chair, he added \u2014 ever deeply I might feel, personally, in terested in the matter, I said nothing to him about it; you see, if I had, he would have had a fair opportunity of saying at once, 'Pray, sir, what is that yon?' and I should have been at a loss for a reply.\" \" Can we doubt,\" said Henry, \" but that this very wound has been inflicted upon Sir Francis Varney, by the pistol bullet which was discharged at him by Flora?\" \" ' Mr. Chillingworth, I have sent for you in consequenco of a slight accident which has happened to my arm. I was incautiously loading some fire-arms, and discharged a pistol so close to me that the bullet inflicted a wound on my arm.' \"'If you will allow me,' said I, ' to see the wound, I will give you my opinion.' \" He then showed me a jagged wound, which had evidently been caused by the passage of a ballet, which, had it gone a little deeper, must have inflicted serious iojury. As it was, the wound was but trifling. \" He had evidently been attempting to dress it himself, but findingsome consider able inflammation, he very likely got a little alarmed.\" \"Everything leads to such an assump tion certainly,\" said Charles Holland. \" And yet you cannot even deduce from that the absolute fact ot Sir Francis V ar ney being a vampyre?\" \" I do not think, Mr. Chillingworth,\" said Marchdale, \"anything would con vince you but a visit from him, and an ac tual attempt to fasten upon some of your own veins.\" \" That would not convince me,\" said Chillingworth. \" Then you will not be convinced?\" \" I certainly will not. I mean to hold out to the last. I said at the first, and I say so still, that I never will give way to this most outrageous superstition.\" \" I wish I could think with you,\" said Marchdale, with a shudder; \" but there may be something in the very atmosphere of this house which has been rendered hideous by the awful visits that have been made to it, which forbids me to disbelieve in those things which others more happily situated can hold at arm's length, aud ut- terly repudiate.\" \" There may be,\" said Henry ; \" but as to that, I think, after the very strongly ex- pressed wish of Flora, I will decide upon leaving the house.\" \" Will you sell it or let it?\" \" The latter I should much prefer,\" was the reply. \"But who will take it now, except Sir Francis Varney ? Why not at once let him have it? I am well aware that this doe3 sound odd advice, but remember, we are all the creatures of circumstances, and that, in some cases where we least like it, we must swim with the stream.\" \" You dressed the wound?\" \"I did.\" \" And what do you think of Sir Francis Varney, now that you have had so capital an opportunity,\" said Henry, \" of a close examination of him.\" \"Why, there is certainly something odd about him which 1 cannot well define, but, take him altogether, he can be a very gen tlemanly man indeed.\" \"So he can.\" \"His manners are easy and polished ; he has evidently mixed in good society, and I never, in all my life, heard such a sweet, soft, winning voice.\" \" That is strictly true. You noticed, I presume, his great likeness to the portrait on the panel?\" \" I did. At some moments, and view- ing his face in some particular lights, it showed much more strongly than at others. My impression was that he could, when he liked, look much more like the portrait on the panel than when he allowed his face to assume its ordinary appearance.\" \"Probably sneb an impression would be produced upon your mind,\" said Charles, \" by some accidental expression of the countenance whicb even he was not aware of, and which often occurs in families.\" \" It may be so.\" \"Of course you did not hint, sir, at what has passed here with regard to him?\" said Henry. \" I did not. Being, you see, called in professionally, I had no right to take ad- vantage of that circumstance to make any remarks to him about his private affairs.\" \" Certainly not.\" \" It was ail one to me whether he was a vampyre or njt, professionally, and how- \" That you will not decide upon, how ever, at present,\" said Charles Holland, as he rose. \" Certainly not ; a few days can make no difference.\" \" None for the worse, certainly, and pos sibly much for the better.\" \" Be it so; we will wait.\" \" Uncle,' said Charles, \" will you spare me half an hour of your company?\" \"An hour, my boy, if you want it,\" said the admiral, rising from his chair."], [110, "100 VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE; OR, \"Then this consultation is over,\" said Henry, \"and we quite understand that to leave the Hall is a matter determined on, and that in a few days a decision shall be come to as to whether Varney the Vam pyre shall be its tenant or not.\" I overcome Varney, there will most likely be at onco an end to the numerous and un comfortable perplexities of thc Banncr woijhs as regards him ; and if he overcome me, why, then, at all events, I shall have made an effort to rescue Flora from the dread of this man.\" \" And then ho shall fight me,\" added the admiral, \" so he shall have two chances, at all events, Charles.\" \"Nay, uncle, that would, you know, scarcely be fair.

THE ADMIRAL'S ADVICE TO CHARLES HOL- LAND. \u2014 THE CHALLENGE TO THE VAM- PTEE. n E N* Charles Holland got his uncle into a room by themselves, he \" Never fear, Charles.

JjgS^-r -tt\u00bb vt- se]f as having been most grievously insulted by this Sir Francis Varney. All accounts aerea in representing him as a gentleman. He goes openly by a titie, which, if it were not his, could easily be contradicted ; therefore, on the score of position in life, there is no fault to find with him. What would you do if you were insulted by a gentleman?\" The old admiral's eyes sparkled, aud he looked comically in the face of Charles, as he said \u2014 \u2022* Xnen I will write it at once, for I have received injuries at tho hands of that man, or devil, be ho what he may, that I cannot put up with. His visit to the chamber of her whom I love, would alone constitute ample ground of action.\" \"I should say it rather wonld, my hoy.\" \" Aud after this corroborative story of the wound, I cannot for a moment doubt that Sir Francis Varney is rhe vampyre, or the personilier ofthe vampyre.\" \"That's clear enough, Charles. Come, just you write your challenge, my boy, at once, and let me have it.\" \" I will, uncle.\" Charles was a little astonished, although pleased, at his uncle's ready acquiescence in his fighting a vampyre, but that circum stance he ascribed to ihe old man's hibits of life, which made him so familiar with strife and personal contention of all sorts, that he did not ascribe to it that amount of importance which more peaceable people did. Hjd he, while he was writing the note to Sir Francis Varney, seen the old ad mirai's face, and the exceedingly cunning look it wore, he mi*_*ht have suspected that the acquiescence in the duel was bat a seeming acquiescence. This, however, escaped him, and in a few moments he read to his uncle the following note: \u2014 \"I know now where you are steering.\" \" What would you do, uncle?\" \" Fight him !\"' \"I knew you would say so, and that's just what I want to do as regards Sir Francis Varney.\" \" Well, my boy, I don't know that, you can do better. He mnst be a thundering rascal, whether he is a vampyre or not ; so if you feel that he has insulted you, light him by all means, Charles.\" \"I am much pleased, uncle, to find that you take my view ofthe subject,\" said Charles. \" I knew that if I mentioned such a thing to the Bannerwcrths, they would endeavour all in their power to persuade me against it.\" . \"Yes, no doubt ; because they arc all impressed with a strange fear of this fel low's vampyre powers. Besides, if a man is going to fight, the fewer people he men tions it to most decidedly the better, Charles.\" \" I believe tbat is the fact, uncle. Should"], [111, "xHE FEAST OF BLOOD. 101 anything else. Come on, will you? I'm goingon rather aparticular cruise just now, so mind what you are about.\" \"Ay, ay, sir,\" said the tar, and these two originals, who so perfectly understood each other, walked away, conversing as they went, and their different voices coming upon the ear of Charles, until distance obliterated all impression of the sound. Charles paced to and fro in the room where he had held this brief and conclusive conversation with his uncle. He was thoughtful, as any one might well be who knew not but that the next four-and-twenty hours would be the limit of his sojourn in this world. \"To Sir Francis Varxey. \" Sir, \u2014 The expressions made use of to wards me by you, as well as general circum stances, which I need not farther allude to here, induce me to demand of you that satisfaction due from one gentleman to another. My uncle, Admiral Bell, is tbe bearer of this note, and will arrange pre liminaries with any friend you may choose to appoint to act in your behalf. I am, sir, yours, dec., \" Charles Holland.\" \"Will that do?\" said Charles. \" Capital !\" said the admiraL \"lam glad you like it.\" \" Oh, I could not help liking it. The least said and the most to the purpose, always pleases me best ; and this explains nothing, and demands all you want \u2014 which is a fight ; so it's all right, you see, and nothing can be possibly better.\" Charles did glance in his uncle's face, for he suspected, from the manner in which these words were uttered, that the old man was amusing himself a little at his expense. The admiral, however, looked so super naturally serious, that Charles was foiled. \" I repeat, it's a capital letter,\" he said, \"Yes, you said so.\" \" Well, what are you staring at?\" \" Oh, nothing.\" \"Do you doubt my word?\" \" Not at all, uncle ; only I thought there was a degree of irony in the manner in which you spoke.\" \" None at all, my boy. I never was more serious in all my life.\" \" Very good. Then you will remember that I leave my honour in this affair com pletely in your hands.\" \" Depend upon me, my boy.\" \" I will, and do.\" \" I'll be off and see the fellow at once.\" The admiral bustled out of the room, and in a few moments Charle3 heard him calling loudly \u2014 \"Jack\u2014 Jack Pringle, you lubber, where are you?\u2014 Jack Pringle, I say.\" \"Ay, ay, sir,\" said Jack, emerging from the kitchen, where he had been mak ing himself generally useful in assisting Mrs. Bannerworth, there being no servant in the house, to cook some dinner for the family. \" Come on, you rascal, we are going for a walk.\" \" Oh, Flora\u2014 Flora !\" heat length said, \" how happy we might have been together \u2014 how happy we might have been! bnt all is past now, and there seems nothing left us but to endure. The... J but one chance, and that is in my killing this fearful man, who is invested with so dreadful an exist- ence. And if I do kill him in fair and in open fight, I will take care that his mortal frame has no power again to revist the glimpses of the moon.\" It was strange to imagine that such was the force of many concurrent circumstances, that a young man like Charles Holland, of first-rate abilities and education, should find it necessary to give in so far to a belief which was repugnant to all his best feelings and habits of thought, as to be reasoning wdth himself upon the best means of pre- venting the resuscitation of the corpse ofa vampyre. But so it was. His imagination had yielded to a succession of events which very few persons indeed could have held out against. \" I have heard and read,\" he said, as he continued his agitated and uneasy walk, \"of how these dreadful beings are to be kept in their graves. I have heard of stakes being driven through the body so as to pin it to the earth until the gradual progress of decay has rendered its re- vivification a thing of utter and total im- possibility. Then, again,\" he added, after a slight pause, \" I have heard of their being burned, and the ashes scattered to the winds of Heaven to prevent themfrom ever again uniting or assuming human form.\" These were disagreeable and strange fancies, and he shuddered while he in- dulged in them. He felt a kind of trembling horror come over him even at the thought of engaging in conflict with a being who, perhaps, had lived more than a hundred years. \" That portrait,\" he thought, \" on the panel, is the portrait of a man in the prime of life. Hit be the portrait of Sir Francis \" The rations will be served out soon,\" growled Jack. \" We shall be back in time, you cormo rant, never fear. You are always thinking of eating and drinking, you are, Jack; and I'll be hanged if I thiuk you ever think of"], [112, "VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE. 102 bing which, among civilians who are not accustomed to discipline, is so very pre valent. The old man, therefore, explained to Jack what he meant to do, and it re ceived Jack's full approval ; but as in the enforced detail of other matters it come out, we will not here prematurely enter into the admiral's plans. When they reached the residence of Sir Francis Varney, they were received courte ously enough, and the admiral desired Jack to wait for him in the handsome hall of the house, while he was shown up stairs to the private room of the vampyre. \"Confound the fellow!\" muttered the old admiral, \" he is well lodged, at all events. I should say ho was not one of those sort of vampyres who have nowhere to go to but their own coffins when the evening comes.\" The room into which the admiral was shown had green blinds to it, and they were all drawn down. It is true that the sun was shining brightly outside, although transiently, but still a strange green tinge was thrown over everything in the room and more particularly did it appear to sal upon the face of Varney, converting hi usually sallow countenance into a still more hideous and strange colour. He was sitting upon a couch, and, when the admiral came in, he rose, and said, ia a deep-toned voice, extremely different to that he usually spoke in, \u2014 \" My humble home is much honoured, sir, by your presence in it.\" \" Good morning,\" said the admiral. \" I have come to speak to you, sir, rather seriously.\" \"However abrupt this announcement may sound to me,\" said Varney, \" I am quite sure I shall always hear, with the most profound respect, whatever Admiral Bell may have to say.\" \" There is no respect required,\" said the admiral, \" but only a little attention.\" Sir Francis bowed in a stately manner, saying,\u2014 \" I shall be quite unhappy if you will not be seated, Admiral Bell.\" \" Ob, never mind that, Sir Francis Var ney, if you be Sir Francis Vamey ; for you may be the devil himself, for all I know. My nephew, Charles Holland, considers that, one way and another, he has a very tolerable quarrel with you.\" \" I much grieve to hear it.\" \"Do you?\" \" Bebeve me, I do. I am most scrupu lous in what I say ; and an assertion that I am grieved, you may thoroughly and en tirely depend upon.\" \" Well, well, never nind that ; Charles Vamey, by the date which the family ascribe to it he must be nearly one hund red and fifty years of age now.\" This was a supposition which carried the imagination to a vast amount of strange coujectures. \" What changes he must have witnessed about him in that time,\" thought Charles. \" How he must have seen kingdoms totter and fall, and how many changes of habits, of manners, and of customs must he have become a spectator of. Renewing too, ever and anon, his fearful existence by sucb fearful means.\" This was wide field of conjecture for a fertile imagination, and now that he was on the eve of engaging with such a being in mortal combat, on behalf of her he loved, the thoughts it gave rise to came more strongly and thickly upon him than ever they had done before. \" But I will fight him,\" he suddenly said, \" for Flora's sake, were he a hundred times more hideous a being than so many evidences tend to prove him. I will fight with him, and it may be my fate to rid the world of such a monster in human form.\" Charles worked himself up to a kind of enthusiasm, by which he almost succeeded in convincing himself that, in attempting the destruction of Sir Francis Varney, he was the champion of human nature. It would be aside from the object of these pages, which is to record facts as they oc curred, to enter into the metaphysical course of reasoning whicb came across Charles's mind ; suffice it to say that he felt nothing shaken as regarded his resolve to meet Varney the Vampyre, and that he made up his mind the conflict should be one of hfe or death. \"It must be so,\" he said. \"It must be so. Either he or I must fall in the fight which shall surely be.\" He now sought Flora, for how soon might he now be torn from her for ever by the irresistible hand of death ! He felt that, during the few brief hours which now would only elapse previous to his meeting with Sir Francis Varney, he could not enjoy too much ofthe society of her who reigned supreme in his heart, and held in her own keeping his best affections. But while Charles is thus employed, let us follow his uncle and Jack Pringle to the residence of Varney, whicb, as the reader is aware, was so near at hand that it re quired not many minutes' sharp walking to reach it.

Admiral Bell felt strongly inclined to get into a rage ; but he repressed the idea as much as he could, althougn, but for the curious faint green light tbat came through the blinds, his heightened colour would have sufficiently proclaimed what state of mind he was in. \" Pull a trigger.\" \"Why, you don't suppose I resort to any such barbarous modes of fighting?\" \" Barbarous !

Oh, nonsense. Nobody fights with swords now-a-days.

I've met a better man more than once before. It can make no difference to you.\" \" Pray how many years ago?\" \" I am older than I look ; but that is not the question. I am willing to meet you with swords, if you like. You are no doubt aware that, as the challenged party, I am entitled to the choice of weapons.\" \" I am.\" \" I don't know that, Admiral Bell. One generally likes, in a duel, to face him with whom one has had the misunderstanding, be it on what grounds it may.\" \" There's some reason, I know, in what you say; but, surely, if I am willing, you need not object.\" \"And is your nephew willing thus to shift the danger and the job of resenting his own quarrels on to your shoulders?\" \" No : he knows nothing about it. He has written you a challenge, of which I am the bearer, but I voluntarily and of my own accord wish to meet you instead.\" \" This is a strange mode of proceeding.\" \" If you will not accede to it, and fight him first, and any harm comes to him, you shall fight me afterwards.\" \"Indeed?\" \" Then you cannot object to my availing myself of the one in the use of which I am perfectly unequalled.\" \"Indeed?\" \" Yes. I am, I think, the first swords man in Europe. I have had immense practice.\" \" Well, sir, you have certainly made a most unexpected choice of weapons. I can use a sword still, but am by no means a master of fencing. However, it shall not be said that 1 went back from my word; and, let the chances be as desperate as they may, I will meet you.\" \" Very good.\" \" With swords?\" \" Yes, indeed you shall, however sur prised you may look.\" \" As this appears to be quite a family affair, then,\" said Sir Francis Varney, \" it \" Ay, with swords. But I must have everything properly arranged, so that no blame can rest on me, you know. As you"], [115, "THE FEAST OF BLOOD. 105 will be killed, you are sirfe from all conse quences; but I shall be in a very different position ; so, if you please, I must have this meeting got up in such a manner as shall enable me to prove, to whoever may question me on the subject, that you had fair play.\" \" Oh, never fear that.\" \" But I do fear it. Tbe world, my good sir, is censorious, and you cannot stop people from saying extremely ill-natured things.\" \" What do you require, then?\" \" I require you to send me a friend with a formal challenge.\" '\u25a0 Well?\" verted into a vampyre, I am to be pitched upon as the man, and insulted and perse cuted accordingly.\" \" But you forget the proofs.\" \" What proofs? ' \" The portrait, for one.\" \" What ! Because there is an accidental likeness between me and an old picture, am I to be set down as a vampyre? Why, when I was in Austria last, I saw an old portrait of a celebrated court fool, and you so strongly resemble it, that I was quite struck when I saw you with the likeness; but I was not so unpolite as to tell you that I considered you were the court fool turned vampyre.\" \" D \u2014 n your assurance !\" \" And d \u2014 n yours, if you come to that !\" The admiral was fairly beaten. Sir Francis Varney was by far too long-headed and witty for him. After now in vain endeavouring to find something to say, the old admiral buttoned up his coat in a great passion, and looking fiercely at Varney, he said \u2014 \" Then I shall refer him to a friend of mine, and they two must settle everything between them.\" \"Is tbat all?\" \" Not quite. I will have a surgeon on the ground, in case, when I pink you, there should be a chance of saving your life. It always looks humane.\" \"When you pink me?\" \" Precisely.\" \" Upon my word, you take these affairs easy. I suppose you have had a few of them?\" \". I don't pretend to a gift of the gab. Damme, it ain't one of my peculiarities ; but, though you may talk me down, you shan't keep me down.\" \"Very good, sir.\" \" It is not very good. You shall hear from me.\" \" Oh, a good number. People like yourself worry me into them. I don't like the trouble, I assure you : it is no amusement to me, I would rather, by a great deal, make some concession than fight, because I will fight with swords, and the result is then so certain that there is no danger in the matter to me.\" \" I am willing.\" \"I don't care whether you are willing or not. You shall find that when once I begin to tackle an enemy, I don't so easily leave him. One or both of us, sir, is sure to sink.\" \" Hark you, Sir Francis Varney. You are either a very clever actor, or a man, as you say, of such skill with your sword that you can make sure of the result of a duel. You know, therefore, that it is not fair play ou your part to fight a duel with that weapon.\" \" Ob, I beg your pardon there. I never challenge anybody ; and when foolish people will call me out, contrary to my inclination, I think I am bound to take what care of myself I can.\" \" Damme, there's some reason in that, too,\" said the admiral. \"But why do you insult people?\" \" People insult me first.\" \" Oh, nonsense !\" \" How should you like to be called a vampyre, and stared at as if you were some hideous phenomenon?\" \" Well, but \" \" I say, Admiral Bell, how should you like it? I am a harmless, country gentle man; and because, in the heated imagina tions of some member of a crack-brained family, some housebreaker has been con- \"Agreed.\" \" So say I. You shall find that I am a tar for all weathers ; and if you were a hundred and fifty vampyres all rolled into one, I'd tackle you somehow.\" The admiral walked to the door in high dudgeon ; when he was near to it, Varney said, in some oi his most winning and gentle accents \u2014 \" Will you not take some refreshment, sir, before you go from my humble house?\" \"No!\" roared the admiral. \" Something cooling?\" \"No!\" \"Very good, sir. A hospitable host can do no more than offer to entertain his guests.\" Admiral Bell turned at the door, and said, with some degree of intense bitter ness \u2014 \" You look rather poorly. I suppose, to-night, you will go and suck somebody's blood, you shark \u2014 you confounded vam pyre! You ought to be made to swallow"], [116, "VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE; OR, 108 a red-hot brick, and then let dance about till it digests.\" Varney smiled as he rang the bell, and said to the servant\u2014 \"Show my very excellent friend, Admiral Bell out. He will not take any refreshments.\" The servant bowed, and preceded the admiral down the staircase ; but, to his great surprise, instead of a compliment in the shape of a shilling or half-a-crown for his pains, he received a tremendous kick behind, with a request to go and take it to bis master, with his compliments. The fume that the old admiral was in beggars all description. He walked to Bannerworth Hall at such a rapid pace, that Jack Pringle had the greatest diffi culty in the world to keep up with him, so as to be at all within speaking distance. \" Hilloa, Jack !\" cried the old man, when they were close to the Hall. \" Did you see me kick that fellow ?\" \" Ay, ay, sir.\" \"Well, that's some consolation, at any rate, if somebody saw it. It ought to have been his master, that's all I can say to it ; and I wish it had.\" \"How have you settled it, sir?\" \"Settled what?\" \" The fight, sir.\" \"Damme, Jack, I haven't settled it at all.\" \"That's bad, sir.\" \" I know it is; but it shall be settled, sor all thaj, I can tell him, let him vapour as much as he may about pinking me, and one thing and another.\" \"PinkiDg you, sir?\" \" Yes. He wants to fight with cutlasses, or toasting-forks \u2014 damme, I don't know exactly which \u2014 and then he must have a surgeon on the ground, for fear when he pinks me I shouldn't slip my cable in a regular way, and he should be blamed.\" Jack gave a long whistle, as he replied \u2014 \" Going to do it, sir?\" \"I don't know, now, what I'm going to do. Mind, Jack, 'Mum!' is the word.\" \"Ay, ay, sir.\" \" I'll turn the matter over in my mind, and then decide upon what had best be done. If he pinks me, I'll take d \u2014 d good care he don't pink Charles.\" \" No, sir \u2014 don't let him do that. A wamphigher, sir, ain't no good opponent to anybody, i never seed one afore, but it strikes me 33 the best way to settle him would be to shut him up in some little bit of a cabin, sir, and then smoke him with brimstone, sir.\" \"Well, well, I'll consider, Jack\u2014 I'll consider. Something must be done, and that quickly, too. Zounds ! here's Charles- What the deuce shall 1 say to him by way of an excuse, I wonder, sor not arrang ing his affair with Varney? Hang me ii I ain't taken aback, now, and don't know where to place a hand !\" CHAPTER XXIV. THE LETTER TO CHARLES. \u2014 THE QUARREL. \u2014 THE ADMIRAL'S NARRATIVE. \u2014 THE MIDNIGHT MEETING. I was Charles Holland who now advanced hurriedly to meet the ad- miral. The young man's manner was anxious. He was evidently most intent upon knowing what answer could be sent by Sir Francis Varney to his challenge. \" Uncle,\" he said, \" tell me at once\u2014 will he meet me? You can talk of parti culars afterwards, but now tell me at once if he will meet me r\" \" Why, as to that,\" said the admiral with a great deal of fidgety hesitation, \"you see, I can't exactly say.\" \" Not say ?\" \" No. He's a very odd fish. Don't you think he's a very odd fish, Jack Pringle?\" \" Ay, ay, sir.\" \" There, you hear, Charles, that Jack is of my opinion that your opponent is an odd fish.\" \" But, uncle, why trifle with my impa tience thus . Have you seen Sir Francis Varney ?\" \" Seen him? Oh, yes.\" \"And what did he say?\" \"Why, to tell the truth, my lad, I ad vise you not to fight with him at all.\" \"Uncle, is this like you? This advice from yon, to compromise my honour, after sending a man a challenge?\" \" D\u2014 n it all, Jack, I don't know how to get out of it,\" said the admiral. \" I tell you what it is, Charles \u2014 he wants to fight with swords ; and what on earth is the use of your engaging with a man who has been practising at his weapon for more than a hundred years?\" \"Well, uncle, if anyone had told me that you would be terrified by this Sir Franci6 Varney into advising me not to"], [117, "THE FEAST OF BLOOD. 107 t fight, I should have had no hesitation whatever in saying such a thing was im possible.\" \"I terrified?\" thing, I tell you. He will fight with swords.\" \"I suppose he is, then, an adept at the use of the sword ?\" \" Why, you advise me not to meet this man, even after I have challenged him.\" \" Jack,\" said the admiral, \" I can't carry it on, you see. I never could go on with anything that was not as plain as an anchor, and quite straightforward. I must just tell all that has occurred.\" \" Ay, ay, sir. The best way.\" \" You think so, Jack >\" \" I know it is, sir \u2014 always axing pardon for having an opinion at all, excepting when ' it happens to be the same as yourn, sir.\" \" Hold your tongue, you libellous vil- lain ! Now, listen to me, Charles. I got up a scheme of my own.\" Charles gave a groan, for he had a very tolerable appreciation of his uncle's amount of skill in getting up a scheme of any kind or description. \"Now, here I am,\" continued the admiral, \" an old hulk, and not fit for use any more. WTiat's the use of me, I should like to know? Well, that's settled. But you are young and hearty, and have a long life before you. Why should you throw away your hfe upon a lnbberly vampyre?\" \" I begin to perceive now, uncle,\" said Charles, reproachfully, \"why you, with such apparent readiness, agreed to this duel taking place.\" \" Well, I intended to fight the fellow i myself, that's the long and the snort of it, buy.\" \"How could you treat me so?\" \"No nonsense, Charles. I tell you it was all in the family. I intended to fight him myself. What was the odds whether I slipped my cable with bis assistance or in tbe regular course a little after this ? That's the way to argufy the subject; so, aa I tell you, I made np my mind to fight him myself.\" Charles looked despairingly, but said \u2014 \" What was the result?\" \" He says he is.\" \" No doubt \u2014 no doubt. I cannot blame a man for choosing, when he has the liberty of choice, that weapon in the use of which he most particularly, from practice, excels.\" \" Yes; but if he be one-half the swords man he has had time enough, according to all accounts, to be, what sort of chance have you with him r\" \" Do I hear you reasoning thus ?\" \" Yes, to be sure you do. I have turned wonderfully prudent, yon see, so I mean to fight him myself ; and mind, now, you have nothing whatever to do with it.\" \" An effort of prudence, that, certainly.\" \" Well, didn't I say so i\" \" Come, come, uncle \u2014 this won't do. I have challenged Sir Francis Varney, and I must meet him with any weapon he may, as the challenged party, choose to select. Besides, you are not, I dare say, aware that I am a very good fencer, and pro bably stand as fair a chance as Varney in a contest with swords.\" \"Indeed:\" \"Yes, uncle. I could not be so long on the continent as I have been without pick ing up a good knowledge of the sword, which is so popular all over Germany.\" \" Humph ! But only consider \u2014 this d \u2014 d fellow is no less than a hundred and fifty years old.\" \" I care not.\" \"Yes, but I do.\" \" Uncle, uncle, I tell yon I will fight with him; and if you do not arrange matters for me so that I can have the meeting with this man, which I have myself sought, and cannot, even if I wished, now recede from with honour, I must seek some other less scrupulous friend to do so.\" \" Give me an hour or two to thinkof it, Charles,\" said the admiral. \"Don't speak to any one else, but give me a little time. You shall have no cause of complaint. Your honour cannot suffer in my hands.\" \"I will wait your leisure, uncle ; but re member that such affairs as these, when once broached, had always better be con cluded with all convenient dispatch.\" \" I know that, boy \u2014 1 know that.\" The admiral walked away, and Charles, who really felt much fretted at the delay which had taken place, returned to the house. \"Oh, the result? Damme, I suppose that's to come. The vagabond won't fight like a Christian. He says he's quite willing to sight anybody that calls him out, pro vided it's all regular.\" \" Well\u2014 well r\" \" And he, being the party challenged \u2014 for he says he never himself challenges snybody, as he is quite tired of it \u2014 must have his choice of weapons.\" \"He is entitled to that ; but it is gene rally understood, now-a-days, that pistols are the weapons in use among gentlemen for such purposes.\" \" Ah, but he won't understand any such He had not been there long, when a lad, who had been temporarily hired during the morning by Henry to answer the gate, brought him a note, saying,\u2014"], [118, "VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE ; OR, 108 Heaven, I will meet this man, and it shall go hard with me but I will this night wring from him the secret of what ha really is. For the sake of her who is so dear to me \u2014 for her sake, I will meet this man, or monster, be he what he may.\" It would have been far more prudent had Charles informed Henry Bannerworth or George of his determination to meet the vampyre that evening, but he did not do so. Somehow he fancied it would be some reproach against his courage if he did not go, and go alone, too, for he could not help suspecting that, from the con duct of his uncle, Sir Francis Varney might have got up an opinion inimical to his courage. With all the eager excitement of youth, there was nothing that arrayed itself to his mind in snch melancholy and uncomfort able colours as an imputation upon his courage. \"A servant, sir, lest this for you just now.\" \"For me?\" said Charles, as he glanced at the direction. \" This is strange, for I have no acquaintance about here. Does any one wait?\" \"No, sir.\" The note was properly directed to him, therefore Charles Holland at once opened it. A glance at the bottom of the page told him that it came from his enemy, Sir Francis Varney, and then he read it with much eagerness. It ran thus: \u2014 \" Sir, \u2014 Your uncle, as he stated himself to be, Admiral Bell, was the bearer to me, as I understood him this day, of a challenge from you. Owing to some unaccountable hallucination of intellect, he seem to imagine that I intended to set myself up as a sort of animated target, for any one to shoot at who might have a fancy so to do. \" According to this eccentric view ofthe case, the admiral bad the kindness to offer to fight me first, when, should he not have the good fortune to put me out ofthe world, you were to try your skill, doubtless. \" I need scarcely say that I object to these family arrangements. You have challenged me, and, fancying the offence sufficient, you defy me to mortal combat. If,' therefore, 1 fight with any one at all, it must be with you. \"You will clearly Understand me, sir, that I do not accuse you of being at all privy to this freak of intellect of your uncle's. He, no doubt, alone conceived it, with a laudable desire on his part of serv ing you. If, however, you have any in clinatiou to meet me, do so to-night, in the middle of the park surrounding your own friends' estate. \" I will show this vampyre, if he be sucb,\" be said, \"that I am not afraid to meet him, and alone, too, at his own hour \u2014 at midnight, even when, if his preter natural powers be of more avail to him than at any other time, he can attempt, if he dare, to use them.\" Charles resolved upon going armed, and with the greatest care he loaded his pistols, and placed them aside ready for action, when the time should come to set out to meet the vampyre at the spot in the park which had been particularly alluded to in bis letter. This spot was perfectly well known to Charles ; indeed, no one could be a single day at Bannerworth Hall without noticing it, so prominent an object was that pollard oak, standing, as it did, alone, with the beautiful green sward all around it. Near to it was the pool which had been men tioned, which was, in reality, a fish-pond, and some little distance off commenced the thick plantation, among the intricacies of which Sir Francis Varney, or the vam pyre, had been supposed to disappear, after the revivification of his body at the full of the moon. \" There is a pollard oak growing close to a small pool; you, no doubt, have no ticed the spot often. Meet me there, if you please, and any satisfaction you like I will give yon, at twelve o'clock this night. '* Come alone, or you will not see me. It shall be at your own option entirely, to convert the meeting into a hostile one or not. You need send me no answer to this. If you are at the place I mention at the time I have named, well and good. If you are not, I can only, if I please, imagine that you shrink form a meeting with \"Francis Varney.\" This spot was in view of several of the windows of the house, so that if the night should happen to be a very light one, and any of the inhabitants of the Hall should happen to have the curiosity to look from those particular windows, no doubt the meeting between Charles Holland and the vampyre would be seen. This, however, was a contingency which was nothing to Charles, whatever it might be to Sir Francis Varney, and he scarcely at all considered it as worth consideration. , He felt more happy and comfortable now j Charles Holland read this letter twice over carefully, and then folding it up, and placing it in bis pocket, he said, \u2014 \u25a0* Yes, I will meet him; he may be as sured that I will meet him. He shall find that 1 do uot shrink from Francis Varney. In tbe name of honour, love, virtue, and"], [119, "THE FEAST OF BLOOD. 109 that everything seemed to be definitively arranged by which he conld come tosome sort of explanation with that mysterious being who had so effectually, as yet, suc ceeded in destroying his peace of mind and his prospects of happiness. \" I will this night force him to declare himself,\" thought Charles. \" He shall tell me who and what he really is, and by some means I will endeavour to put an end to those frightful persecutions which Flora has suffered.\" \" It may be so, Flora. You are aware that your brother has made up his mind that he will leave the Hall?\" \" Yes, yes.\" \" And that only in deference to an ex pressed wish of mine he put off the carry ing such a resolve into effect for a few days?\" \" He said so much.\" \" Do not, however, imagine, dearest Flora, that those lew days will be idly spent.\" \" Nay. Charles, I conld not imagine so.\" \" Believe me, I have some hopes that in that short space of time I shall be able to accomplish yet something which shall have a material effect upon the present posture of affairs.\" \"Do not run into danger, Charles.\" \" I will not. Believe me, Flora, I have too much appreciation of the value of an existence which is blessed by your love, to encounter any needless risks.\" \" You say needless. Why do you not confide in me, and tell me if the object you have in view to accomplish in the few days delay is a dangerous one at all?\" \" Will you forgive me, Flora, if for once I keep a secret from you?\" \" Then, Charles, along with the forgive ness I must conjure up a host of appre hensions.\" This was a thought which considerably raised Charles's spirits, and when he sought Flora again, which he now did, she was surprised to see him so much more easy and composed in his mind, which was sufficiently shown by his manner, than he had been but so short a time before. \" Charles,'' she said, \" what has hap pened to give such an impetus to your spirits?\" \"Nothing, dear Flora, nothing; but I have been endeavouring to throw from my mind all gloomy thoughts, and to convince myself, that in the future you and I, dearest, may yet be very happy.\" \" Oh, Charles, if I could but think so.\" \"Endeavour, Flora, to think so. Re member how much our happiness is always in our own power, Flora, and that, let fate do her worst, so long as we are true to each other, we have a recompense for every ill.\" \"Oh, indeed, Charles, that is a dear recompense.\" \" And it is well that no force of circum stances short of death itself can divide us.\" \" Nay, why so?\" \" You would tell me if there were no circumstances that you feared would fill me with alarm.\" \" Now, Flora, your fears and not your judgment condemn me. Surely you can not think me so utterly heedless as to court danger for danger's sake?\" \" No, not so \" \" You pause.\" \" And yet you have a sense of what you call honour, which, I fear, would lead you into much risk.\" \" True, Charles, true, and I am more than ever now bound to look upon you with amoving heart; for have you not elung to me generously under circumstances which, if any at all could have justified you in rending asunder \"every tie which bound us together, surely would have done somost fully?\" \" It is misfortune and distress that tries love,\" said Charles. \" It is thus that the touchstone is applied to see if it be current gold indeed, or some base metal, which by a superficial glitter imitates it.\" \" And your love is indeed true gold ?\" \"I were unworthy of one glance from those dear eyes if it were not.\" \" Oh, if we could but go fro\u0153 here, I think then we might be happy. A strong impression is upon my mind, and has been so for some time, that these persecutions to which I have been subjected are pecu liar to this house.\" \"I have a sense of honour; but not that foolish one whicb hangs far more upon the opinions of others than my own. If I thought a course of honour lay before me, and all the world, in a mistaken judgment, were to condemn it as wrong, I would follow it.\" \"You are right, Charles; you are right Let me pray of you to be careful, and, at all events, to interpose no more delay to our leaving this house than you shall feel convinced is absolutely necessary for some object of real and permanent importance.\" Charles promised Flora Bannerworth that, for her sake as well as for his own, he would be most specially careful of his safety; and then in such endearing con- \"Think you so?\" \"I do, indeed!\""], [120, "110 THE FEAST OF BLOOD. i.f imagination.

What was an actual hour, was but a sleeting minute to Charles Hol- land, as he sat with Flora's hand clasped in his, and looking at her sweet face. At length a clock striking reminded him of his engagement with his uncle, and he I ' reluctantly rose. I \" Dear Flora,\" he said, \" I am going to sit up to watch to-night, so be under no sort of apprehension.\" \" I will feel doubly safe,\" she said. \" I have now something to talk to my , uncle about, and must leave you.\" Flora smiled, and held out her hand to j him. He pressed it to his heart. He knew j not what impulse came over him then, but ' for the first time he kissed the cheek of the jl beautiful gill. With a teightened colour she gently repulsed him. He took a long, lingering look at her as he passed out of the room, and when the door was closed between them, the sensation he experienced was as if some sudden cloud had swept across the face of the sun, dimming to a vast extent its precious lustre. A strange heaviness came across his spirits, which before had been so unac- countably raised. He felt as if the shadow of some coming evil was resting on his soul \u2014 as if some momentous calamity was preparing for him, which would almost be enough to drive him to madness, and irre- deemable despair. \" What can this be,\" he exclaimed, \"that thus oppresses me? What feeling is this that seems to tell me, I shall never jj again see Flora Bannerworth?\" I j Unconsciously he uttered these words, which betrayed the nature of his worst forebodings. \" Ob, this is weakness,\" he then added. \"I must fight out against this; it is mere nervousness. I must not endure it.

When Charles appeared, he quickened his pace, and looked in such a state of unusual per plexity, that it was quite ridiculous to ob serve him. \" I suppose, uncle, you bave made up your mind thoroughly by this time ?\" \" Well, I don't know that.\" \" Why, you have had long enough surely to think over it. I have not trou bled you soon.\" \" Well, I cannot exactly say you have, but, somehow or another, I don't think very fast, and I have an unfortunate pro pensity after a time of coming exactly round to where I begun.\" \"Then, to tell the truth, uncle, yon can come to no sort of conclusion.\" \" Only one.\" \" And what may that be?\" \" Why, that you are right in one thing, Charles, which is, that having sent a chal lenge to this fellow of a vampyre, you must fight him\" \"I suspect tbat that is a conclusion you had from the first, uncle?\" \"Why so?\" \" Because it is an obvious and a natural one. All your doubts, and trouble, and perplexities, have been to try and find some excuse for not extertaining that opinion, and now that you really find it in vain to make it, I trust you will accede as you first promised to do, and not seek by any means to thwart me.\" \"I will not thwart you, my boy, al though, in my opinion, you ought not to fight with a vampyre.\" \"Never mind that We cannot urge that as a valid excuse, so long as he chooses \u2022\u00bb\u25a0\u25a0\u2022\u00bb"], [121, "VARNEY THE VAMPYRE; OR, THE FEAST OF BLOOD. 113 THE ADMIRAL WATCHES CHARLES'S MIDNIGHT DEPARTURE FROM THE HALL. to deny being one.

But as regards this duel. Will you wait now until to-morrow morn ing before you take any further steps in the matter?\" \" Till to-morrow morning?\" \" Yes, uncle.\" \" Why, only a little while ago, you were all eagerness to have something done off hand.\" \"Just so; but now I have a particular reason for waiting until to-morrow morn ing.\" Have you?

I was once in the southern ocean, in a small frigate, looking out fur a seventy-four we were to join company with, when a man at the mast-head sung out that he saw her on the larboard bow.

He was swimming along with his head just what Idare say he considered a shaving or so out of the water.\" \" But where were the sails, uncle?\" \" The sails?\" \" Yes ; your man at the mast-head must have been apoor seaman not to have missed the sails.\" \"Ah, that's one of your shore-going ideas, now. You know nothing whatever about it. I'll tell you where the sails were, master Charley.\" \" Well, I should like to know.\" \" The spray, then, that he dashed up with a pair of fins that were close to his head, was in such a quantity, and so white, that they looked just like sails.\" \" Oh !\" \" Ah ! you may say ' oh !' but we all saw him \u2014 the whole ship's crew; and we sailed alongside of him for some time, till he got tired of us, and suddenly dived down, making such a vortex in the water, that the ship shook again, and seemed for about a minute as if she was inclined to follow him to the bottom of the sea.\" \"And what do you suppose it was, uncle?\" \"How should I know?\" \"Did you ever see it again?\" \" Never ; though others have caught a glimpse of him now and then in the same ocean, but never came so near him as we did, that ever I heard of, at all events. They may have done so.\" \" It is singular !\" \" Singular or not^ it's a fool to what I can tell you. Why, I've seen things that, if I were to set about describing them to you, you would say I was maSing up a romance.\" \" Yes; he's something like a fellow that figured in an affair that I know a good deal about ; only I do think as my chap was more mysterious by a d\u2014 d sight than this one.\" \"Indeed!\" \" Ob, dear, yes.

It seems to me as though there was something hanging over us, and I can't tell what.\" \" Yes, there are the colours, Jack, at the mast-head; they are flying over us with a hearty breeze.\" \"Ah! ah!\" said Jack, looking up at the colours, and then went away without say- ing anything more, for he had some piece of duty to perform. I thought my messmate had something on his mind that caused him to feel sad and uncomfortable, and I took no more notice of it ; indeed, in the course of a day or two he was as merry as any of the rest, and had j no more melancholy that I could perceive, but was as comfortable as anybody. Wehadagale offthecoast cf Biscay, and rode it out without the loss of a spar or a yard ; indeed, without the slightest acoi- dent or rent of any kind. \" Now, Jack, what do you think of onr vessel?\" said I. \"She's like a duck upon water, rises and falls with the waves, and doesn't tumble up and down like a hoop over stones.\" \" No, no ; she goes smoothly and sweetly ; she is a gallant craft, and this is her first voyage, and I predict a prosperous one.\" \" I hope so,\" he said. Well, we went on prosperously enough for about three weeks; the ocean was as calm and as smooth as a meadow ; the breeze fight but good, and we stemmed along majestically over the deep blue waters, and passed coast after coast, though all around was nothing but the apparently pathless main in sight. \" A better sailer I never stepped into,\" said the captain one day; \"it would be a pleasure to live and die in such a vessel.\" Well, as I said, we had been three weeks or thereabouts, when one morning, after the sun was up and the decks washed, we saw a strange man sitting on one of the water casks that were on deck, for, being full, we were compelled to stow some of them on deck. You may guess those on deck did a little more than stare at this strange and unexpected apparition. By jingo, I never saw men open their eyes wider in all my life; nor was I any exception to the rule. 1 stared, as well I might; but we said no- thing for some minutes, and the stranger looked calmly on us, and then cocked his eye with a nautical air up at the sky, as if he expected to receive a twopenny-post \"Indeed! why so?\" \"Because I didn't want to be continually fighting people for not believing it; but hereyou have it: \u2014 We were outward bound ; a good ship, a good captain, and good messmates, you know, go far towards making a prosperous voyage a pleasant and happy one, and on this occasion we had every reasonable prospect of all. Our hands were all tried men \u2014 they had been sailors from infancy ; none of your French craft, that serve an apprenticeship and then become land lubbers again. Oh, no, they were staunch and true, and loved the ocean as the sluggard loves his bed, or the lover his mistress. Ay, and for the matter of that, the love was a more enduring and a more healthy love, for it increased with years, and made men love one another, and they would stand by each other while they had a limb to lift \u2014 while they were able to chew a quid or wink an eye, leave alone wag a pigtail. We were outward bound for Ceylon, with cargo, and were to bring spices and other matters home from the Indian market. The ship was new and good\u2014 a pretty craft ; she sat like a duck upon the water, and a stiff breeze carried her along the sur- faceof the waves without your rocking, and pitching, and tossing, like an old wash-tub at a mill-tail, as I have had the misfortune to sail in more than once afore. No, no, we were well laden, and well pleased, and weighed anchor with light hearts and a hearty cheer. Away we went down the river, and soon rounded the North Foreland, and stood out in the Channel The breeze was a steady and stiff one, and carried us through the water as though it had been made for us. \"Jack,\" said I, to a messmate of mine, as he stood looking at the skies, then at the sails, and finally at the water, with a graver airthan I thought was at all consistent with the occasion or circumstances. \" Well,\" he replied. \"What ails you? You seem as melan- choly as if we were about to cast lots who should be eaten first. Are you well enough?\" \"I am hearty enough, thank Heaven,\" he said, \" but I don't like this breeze.\" \" Don't like this breeze!\" said I; \" why, mate, it is as good and kind a breezo as ever filled a sail. What, would you have a gale?\" \"No, no; I fear that.\" \" With such a ship, and such a set of hearty able seamen, I think we could manage to weather out the stiffest gale that ever whistled through a yard.\""], [124, "114 VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE; OR, I \" I'll see to that. I'll see if I can't make the lubber say something, providing his tongue's not cut out. But how came he on board? Confound it, he can't be the de- vil, and dropped from the moon !\" \" Don't know, captain,\" said I. \"He is evil-looking enough, to my mind, to be the father of evil, bat it's ill bespeaking atten- tions from that quarter at any time.\" \" Go on, lad; I'll come up after you.\" I left the cabin, and I heard the captain coming after me. When I got on deck, I saw he had not moved from the place where I left him. There was a general commo- tion among the crew when they heard of the occurrence, and all crowded round him, save the man at the wheel, who had to re- main at his post. The captain now came forward, and the men fell a little back as he approached. For a moment the captain stood silent, at tentively examining the stranger, who was excessively cool, and stood the scrutiny with the same unconcern that he would had the captain been looking at his watch. \" Well, my man,\" said the captain, \"how did you come here?\" \" I'm part of the cargo,\" he said, with an indescribable leer. letter from St. Michael, or a billet doux from the Virgin Mary. \" Where has he come from?\" said one of the men in a low tone to his companion, who was standing by him at that moment \" How can I tell ?\" replied his com- panion. \" He may have dropped from the clouds ; he seems to be examining the road ; perhaps he is going back.\" The stranger sat all this time with the most extreme and provoking coolness and unconcern; he deigned us but a passing notice, but it was very slight. He was a tall, spare man \u2014 who seemed long and lathy \u2014 but he was evidently a powerful man. He had a broad chest, and long, sinewy arms, a hooked nose, and a black, eagle eye. His hair was curly, but frosted by age; it seemed at though it had been tinged with white at the extremities ; bnt he was hale and active otherwise, to judge from appearances. Notwithstanding all this, there was a singular repulsiveness about him that I could not imagine the cause, or describe; at the same time, there was an air of deter mination in his wild and singular-looking eyes, and over their whole there was de cidedly an air and an appearance so sinis ter as to be positively disagreeable. \" Well,\" said I, after we had stood some minutes, \"where did you come from, ship mate?\" \" Part of the cargo be d d !\" said the captain, in sudden rage, for he thought the stranger was coming his jokes too strong, \" I know you are not in the bills of lad ing.\" \"I'm contraband,\" replied the stranger; \"and my uncle's the great cham of Tar tary.\" The captain stared, as well he might, and did not speak for some minutes; all the while thestrangerkeptkicking his heels against the water-casks and squinting up at the skies; it made us feel very queer. \" Well, I must confess you are not in the regular way of trading.\" \" Oh, no,\" said the stranger ; \" I am contraband \u2014 entirely contraband.\" \"And how did you come on board?\" At this question, the stranger again looked curiously up at the skies, and con tinued to do so for more than a minute ; he then turned his gaze upon the captain. \" No, no,\" said the captain ; \" eloquent dumb show won't do with me; you didn't come, like Mother Shipton, upon a birch broom. How did you come on board my vessel?\" He looked at me, and then up at the sky, in a knowing manner. \" Come \u2014 come, that won't do ; you have none of Peter Wilkins's wings, and couldn't come on the serial dodge ; it won't do; how did you get here?\" He gave me an awful wink, and made a sort of involuntary movement, which jumped him up a few inches, and he bumped down again on the water-cask. \" That's as much as to say,\" thought I, \" that he's sat himself on it.\" \" I'll go and inform the captain,\" said I, \" of this affair ; he'll hardly believe me when I tell him, I am sure.\" So saying, I left the deck, and went to the cabin, where the captain was at break fast, and related to him what I had seen respecting the stranger. The captain looked at me with an air of disbelief, and said \u2014 \" What ! \u2014 do you mean to say there's a man on board we haven't see before?\" \"Yes, I do, captain. I never saw him afore, and he's sitting beating his heels on the water-casks on deck.\" \"I walked on board,\" said the stranger. \"You walked on board; aad where did you conceal yourself?\" \" Below.\" \"The devil!\" \"He is, I assure you, sir; and he won't answer any questions.\" \"Very good; and why didn't you stay below altogether?\""], [125, ". OF BLOOlJ. 115 \"Because I wanted fresh air. I'm in a delicate state of heflitb. you fee; it d :esu't do to stay in a confined place too long.\" \"Contouudthe bii.nacle !\" said the cap tain \u2014 it was his usual oath when anything bothered him, and he could nut make it out \" Confound the binnacle ! \u2014 what a delicate-looking animal you are. I wish you had stayed where you were; your deli cacy would have been all the same to me. Delicate, indeed !\" \"Yes, very,\" said the stranger, coolly. There was something so comic in the assertion of his delicateness of health, that we should all have laughed; but we were somewhat scared, and had not the inclina tion. he merely screwed his mouth up into an nic.imptehensible shape, and puffed out a lot of breath, with some force, and which sounded very much like a whistle: but, oh, what thick breath he had! It was as much like smoke as anything I ever saw, and so my shipmates said. \"I say, captain,\" said the stranger, as he saw him pacing the deck. \"Well?\" \" Just send me up some beef and biscuit, and some coffee royal \u2014 be sure it's royal, do you hear, because I'm partial to brandy ; it's the only good thing there is on earth.\" I shall not easily forget the captain's look as he turned towards the stranger, and gave his huge shoulders a shrug, as much as to say \u2014 \" How have you lived since you came on board ?\" inquired the captain. \" Very inditierently.\" \" But how? What have you eaten? and what have you drank?\" \" Nothing, I assure you. All 1 did while I was below was '' \" Well, I can't help it now; he's here, and I can't throw him overboard. \" The coffee, beef, and biscuit were sent him, and the stranger seemed to eat them with great gout, and drank the coffee with much relish, and returned the things, say ing\u2014 \" Your captain is an excellent cook; give him my compliments.\" I thought the captain would think that was but a left-handed compliment, and look more angry than pleased, but no notice was taken of it. \"What?\" *' Why, I sucked my thumbs, like a polar bear in its winter quarters.\" And as he spoke the 6tranger put his two thumbs in his mouth; and extraordinary thumbs they were, too, for each would have filled an ordinary man's mouth. \" These,\" said the stranger, pulling them out, and gazing at them wistfully, and with a deep sigh he continued \u2014 \"These were thumbs at one time; but they are nothing now to what they were.\" \" Confound the binnacle 1\" muttered the captain to himself; and then he added, aloud \u2014 \"It's cheap living, however; but where are you going to, and why did you come aboard?\" It was strange, but this man had im pressed upon all in the vessel some singular notion of his being more than he should be \u2014 more than a mere mortal, and not one endeavoured to interfere with him. The captain was as stout and dare-devil a fel low as you would well meet with, yet he seemed tacitly to acknowledge more than he wonld say, for he never after took any farther notice of the stranger, nor he of him. They had barely any conversation \u2014 simply a civil word when they first met and so on ; but there was little or no con versation of any kind between them. The stranger slept upon deck, and lived upon deck entirely ; he never once went below after we saw him, and his own ac count of being below so long. This was very well, but the night-watch did not enjoy his society, and would have willingly dispensed with it at that hour so particularly lonely and dejected upon the broad ocean, and perhaps a thousand miles away from the nearest point of land. At this dread and lonely hour, when no sound reaches the ear and disturbs the wrapt stillness of the night, save the whistling of the wind through tbe cordage, or an occasional dash of water against the vessel's side, the thoughts of the sailor are fixed ou far distant objects\u2014 his own \"I wanted a cheap cruise, and I am go ing there and back.\" \" Why, that's where we are going,\" said the captain. \" Then we are brothers,\" exclai med the stranger, hopping off the water-cask like a kangaroo, and bounding towards the cap tain, holding out his hand as though he would have shaken hands with him. \" No, no,\" said the captain ; \" I can't do it\" \" Can't do it !\" exclaimed the stranger, angrily. \" What do you mean?\" \" That I can't have anything to do with contraband articles; I am a fair trader, and do all above board. I haven't a chaplain on board, or he should offer up prayers for your preservation, and the recovery of your health, whicb seems so delicate.\" \"That be \" The stranger didn't finish the sentence;"], [126, "VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE; OR, 116 native land, and the friends and loved ones he has left behind him. He then thinks of the wilderness before, behind, and around him ; of the immense body of water, almost in places bottomless. Gazing upon such a scene, and with thoughts as strange and indefinite as the very boundless expanse betore him, it is no wonder if he should become superstitious* the time and place would, indeed, un bidden, conjure up thoughts and feelings of a fearful character and intensity. The stranger at such times would occupy his favourite seat on the water-cask, and looking up at the sky and then on the ocean, and between whiles he would whistle a strange, wild, unknown melody. The flesh of the sailors used to creep up in knots and bumps when they heard it : the wind used to whistle as an accompani ment, and pronounce fearful sounds to their ears. cask floated overboard at every minute ; but, as the captain said \u2014 \" Confound the binnacle ! the old water tub seems as if it were screwed on to the deck, and won't move off, and he on the top of it\" There was a strong inclination to throw him overboard, and the men conversed in low whispers, and came round the captain, saying \u2014 \" We have come, captain, to ask you what you think of this strange man who has como so mysteriously on board?\" \" I can't tell what to think, lads ; he's past thinking about ; he's something above my comprehension altogether, I promise you.\" \" Well, then, wa are thinking much ot the same thing, captain.\" \"What do you mean?\" \" That he ain't exactly one of our sort\" \"No, he's no sailor, certainly; and yet, for a land-lubber, he's about as rum a cus tomer as ever I met with.\" The wind had been highly favourable from the first ; and since the stranger had been discovered it had blown fresh, and we went along at a rapid rate, stemming the water, and dashing the spray off from the bows, and cutting the water like a shark. This was very singular to us. We couldn't understand it, neither could the captain ; and we looked very suspiciously at the stranger, and wished him at the bottom; for the freshness of the wind now became a gale, and yet the ship came through the water steadily, and away we went before the wind as if the devil drove ns; and, mind, I don't mean to say he didn't. \" So he is, sir.\" \"He stands salt water well; and I must say that I couldn't lay atop of those water casks in that style very well.\" \" Nor nobody amongst us, sir.'' \" Well, then, he's in nobody's way, is he? Nobody wants to take his berth, I suppose?\" The men looked at each other somewhat blank; they didn't understand the meaning at all \u2014 far from it ; and the idea of any one's wanting to take the stranger's place on the water-casks, was so outrageously ludi crous, that at any other time they would have considered it a devilish good joke, and have never ceased laughing at it. He paused some minutes, and then one of them said\u2014 The gale increased to a hurricane ; and though we had not a stitch of canvas out, yet we drove before the gale as if we had been shot out of the mouth of a gun. The stranger still sat on the water-cask, and all night long he kept up his infernal whistle. Now, sailors don't hke to hear any one whistle when there's such a gale blowing over their heads\u2014 it's like asking for more ; bnt he would persist, and the louder and stronger the wind blew the louder he whistled. \" It isn't that we envy him his berth, captain, 'cause nobody else could live there for a moment. Anyone amongst us that had been there would have been washed overboard a thousand times over.\" \"So they would,\" said the captain. \" Well, sir, he's more than us.\" \" Very likely; but how can I help that?\" \" We think he's the main cause of all this racket in the heavens \u2014 the storm and hurricane ; and that, in short, if he remains much longer we shall all sink.\" \"I am sorry for it. I don't think we are in any danger ; and had the strange being any power to prevent it he would assuredly do so, lest he got drowned.\" \" But we think if he were thrown over- j board all would be well.\" At length there came a storm of rain, lightning, and wind. We were tossed mountains high, and the foam rose over the vessel, and often entirely over our heads, and the men were lashed to their posts to prevent being washed away. But the stranger still lay on the water cask, kicking his heels, and whistling his infernal tune, always the same. He wasn't washed away, nor moved by the action of the water. Indeed, we heartily hoped and expected to see both him and the water- \" Indeed?\" \" Yes, captain ; you may depend upon"], [127, "THE FEAST OF BLOOD. 119 it he's the cause of all the mischief.

It is to save our own lives.\" We all stared at this, and couldn't help it; and we were quite convinced we could not tnrow him overboard, but he would probably have no difficulty in throwing us overboard. \"Well, what do you want?\" he again exclaimed to ns all. \" I can't let you do any such thing: he's in nobody's way.\" \" But he's always a whistling. Only hark now; and in such a hurricane as this it is dreadful to think of it. What else can we do, sir? He's not human.\" We looked at one another, and had scarce courage to speak. At length I said \u2014 \" We wish you to leave off whistling.\" \u25a0\" Leave off whistling !\". he said. \" And why should I do anything of the kind?\" \" Because it brings the wind.\" \" Ha\u2014 ha! ' Why, that's the very reason I am whistling, to bring the wind.\" \" But we don't want so much.\" \"Pho \u2014 pbo! You don't know what's good for you. It's a beautiful breeze, and not a bit too stiff.\" At this moment, the stranger's whistling came clear upon their ears. There was the same wild, unearthly notes as before, ; - -i,n r^-ionces were stronger, and there voj .*, supernatural clearness in all the tones. \"There, now,\" said another, \" he's kick ing the water-cask with his heels.\" \"Confound the binnacle!\" said the cap tain: \"it sounds like short peals of thun der. Go and talk to him, lads.\" \" And if that won't do, sir, may we \u2014 \" \" Don't ask me any questions. I don't think a score of the best men that were ever born could move him.\" \" It's a hurricane.\" \"Nonsense.\" \"But it is.\" \"Now, yon see how I'll prove you are wrong in a minute. You see my hair, don't you?\" he said, after he took off his cap. \" Very well\u2014 look now.\" He got up on the water-cask, and stood bolt upright ; and running his fin gers through his hair, made it all stand straight on end. \" Confound the binnacle !\" said the cap tain, \" if ever I saw the like.\" \"There,\" said the stranger, trium phantly, \" don't tell me there's any wind to signify. Don't you see, it doesn't even move one of my gray hairs ; and if it blew as hard as you say, I am certain it would move a hair.\" \"Confound the binnacle!\" muttered the captain, as he walked away. \" D \u2014 n the cabouse, if he ain't older than I am. He's too many for me and everybody else.\" \" I don't mind trying,\" said one. Upon this the whole of the men moved to the spot where the water-cask was standing and the stranger lay. There he was, whistling like fury, and at the same time beating his heels to the tune against the empty cask. We came up to him, and he took no notice of ns at all, but kept on in the same way. \"Hilloa!\" shouted one. \" Hilloa !\" shouted another. No notice, however, was taken of us, and one of our number, a big, herculean fellow, an Irishman, seized him by the leg, either to make him get up, pr, as we thought, to give him a lift over our heads into the sea. However, he had scarcely got his fingers round the calf of the leg, when the stranger pinched his leg so tight against the water cask that he could not move, and was as effectually pinned as if he had been nailed there. The stranger, after he had finished a bar of the music, rose gradually to a sitting posture, and without the aid of his hands, and looking the unlucky fellow in the face, he said \u2014 \" Well, what do you want?\" \"My hand,\" said the fellow. \" Take it, then,\" he said. He did take it, and we saw that there was blood on it. \" Are you satisfied?\" What could we say? We turned away, and left the place, and stood at our quar ters \u2014 there was no help for it \u2014 we were compelled to grin and abide by it. As soon as we had left the place, he put his cap on again and sat down on the water-cask, and then took leave of his prisoner, whom he set free, and there lay at full length on his back, with his legs hanging down. Once more he began to whistle most furiously, and beat time with his feet. For full three weeks did he continue at this game night and day, without any in terruption, save sucb as he required to consume enough coffee royal, iunk, and The stranger stretched out his left hand, and taking him by the breech, he lifted"], [128, "118 YA&NEY, 'J HE VAMPYRE; OR, biscuit, as would have served three hearty men. mentioned, or merely give him a meeting as a preliminary step. He was rather, on the whole, inclined to think that 6ome explanation would be offered by Varney; but, at all events, he persevered in his determination of going well armed, lest anything in the shape ot treachery should be intended. As nothing of any importance occurred now in the interval of time till nearly midnight, we will at once step to that time, and our readers will suppose it to be a quarter to twelve o'clock at night, and young Charles Holland on the point of leaving the house, to keep his appointment by the pollard oak, with the mysterious Sir Francis Varney. He placed his loaded pistols conveni ently in his pocket, su that at a moment's notice be could lay hands on them, and then wrapping himself up in a travelling cloak he had brought with him to Ban nerworth Hall, he prepared to leave his chamber. Well, about that time, one night the whistling ceased, and he began to sing \u2014 oh ! it was singing \u2014 such a voice ! Gog and Magog in Guildhall, London, when they spoke, were nothing to him \u2014 it was awful ; but the wind calmed down to a fresh and sttfF breeze. He continued at this game for three whole days and nights, and on the fourth it ceased, and when we went to take his coffee royal to him he was gone. We hunted about everywhere, but he was entirely gone, and in three weeks after we safely cast anchor, having per formed our voyage in a good month under the usual time ; and had it been au old vessel she would have leaked and started like a tub from the straining ; however, we were glad enough to get in, and were curi ously inquisitive as to what was put in our vessel to come back with, for as the cap tain said \u2014 \" Confound the binnacle !

From his window he could not perceive the spot in the park where he was to meet Varney, because the room in which he was occupied not a sufficiently high place in the house to enable him to look over a belt of trees that stopped the view.

The day was now, however, getting far advanced, and Charles Holland began to think of his engagement with the vampyre. He read and read the letter over and over again, but he could not come to a correct conclusion as to whether it intended to imply that he, Sir Francis Varney, would tan t o fight him at the hour and place He rose and dressed himself again, in tending to sit up for an hour, and then turn into bed, and try a second time to get to sleep. But he had no means of getting a light, so he drew the heavy curtain from before the window, and let in as much of the moonlight as he could.

He cast a glance at the portrait in the panel before he left the apartment, and then saying \u2014 Even the admiral, who never would confess to seeing much beauty in scenery where water formed not a large portion of \", c mid not resist opening his window and locking out, with a considerable de gree of admiration, upon wood and dale, *\u25a0 they were illuminated by the moon's rays softened, and rendered, if anything, mor'e beautiful by the light vapour through which they had to struggle to make their way. \"For you, dear Flora, for you I essay this meeting with the fearful original of that portrait,\" he immediately opened his window, and stepped out on to the balcony. Young and active as was Charles Hol land, to descend from that balcony pre sented to him no difficulty whatever, and he was, in a very few moments, safe in the garden of Bannerworth Hall. He never thought, for a moment, to look up, or he would, iu an instant, have seen the white head of his old uncle, as it was Charles Holland, in order to avoid the likelihood of meeting with any one who would question him as to where he was going, determined upon leaving his room No. 16."], [130, "VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE; OR, 120 projected over the sill of the window of his chamber. you can show me exactly which way he went.\" \" That I can easily. And in case I should have made any mistake, which it is not at all likely, we can go to his room first and see if it is empty.\" \"A good thought certainly; that will at once put an end to all doubt upon the question.\" They both immediately proceeded to Charles's room, and then the admiral's accuracy pf identification of his nephewwas immediately Of oved by finding that Charles was not there, and that the window was wide open. \" You see I am right?\" said the admiral \"You are,\" cried Henry; \"but wbat ha^e7'?\" \" Here on the dressing-table. Here are no less than three letters, all laid as if on purpose to catch the eye of the first one who might enter the room.\" \" Indeed !\" \" You perceive them?\" Henry held them to the light and after a moment's inspection of them, he said, in a voice of much surprise \u2014 \" Good God ! what is the meaning of this?\" \"The meaning of what?\" \"Tbe letters are addressed to parties in the house here. Do you not see?\" \"To whom?\" \" One to Admiral Bell \" \"Tbe deuce 1\" \" Another to me, and the third to my sister, Flora. There is some new mystery here.\" The admiral looked at the superscription of one of tbe letters which was handed to him in silent amazement. Then he cried \u2014 \" Set down the light, and let us read them.\" The drop of Charles from the balcony of his window just made sufficient noise to attract the admiral's attention, and then, before he could think of making any alarm, he saw Charles walking hastily across a grass plot, which was sufficiently in the light ofthe moon to enable tbe admiral at once to recognise him, and leave no sort of doubt as to bis positive identity. Of course, upon discovering that it was Charles, the -necessity for making an alarm fio longer existed, and, indeed, not knowing what it was that had induced him to leave his chamber, a moment's reflection sug gested to him the propriety of not even calling to Charles, lest he should defeat some discovery which he might be about to make. \"He bas heard something, or seen some thing,'-' thought the admiral, \" aud is gone to find out what it is. I only wish I was with him ; but up here I can do nothing at all, that's quite clear.\" Charles, he saw, walked very rapidly, and like a man who has some fixed destina tion which he wishes to reach as quickly as possible. When he dived among the trees which skirted one side of tbe flower gardens, the admiral was more puzzled than ever, and he said \u2014 \" Now where on earth is he off to? He is fully dressed, and has his cloak about him.\" After a few moments' reflection, he de cided that, having seen something suspi cious, Charles must have got up, and dressed himself, to fathom it. The moment this opinion became fairly im pressed upon his mind, he left his bedroom, and descended to where one of the brothers he knew was sitting up, keeping watch during the night. It was Henry who was so on guard ; and when the admiral came into the room, he uttered an expression of surprise to find him up, for it was now some time past twelve o'clock. \" I have come to teU you that Charles has left tbe bouse,\" said the admiral. \"Left the house?\" Henry did so, and then they simultane ously opened the epistles which were seve rally addressed to them. There was a silence, as of the very grave, for some mo ments, and then the old admiral staggered to a seat, as be exclaimed \u2014 \" Am I dreaming\u2014 am I dreaming?\" \" Ts this possible?\" said Henry, in a voice of deep emotion, as he allowed the note addressed to hiifi to drop on to the floor. \" D \u2014 n it, what does yours say ?\" cried the old admiral, in a louder tone. \" Read it. What say's yours?\" \" Read it. I'm amazed!\" The letters were exchanged, and read by each with the same breathless attention they had bestowed upon their own ; after which, they both looked at each other in \" Yes; I saw him just now go across the garden.\" \"And are jou sure it was he?\" \" Quite sure. I saw him by the moon light crossthe green plot.\" \" Then you may depend he has seen or heard something, and gone alone to find out what it is rather than give any alarm.\" \"That is just what I think.\" \" It must be so.

Not to keep our readers in suspense, we at once transcribe each of these letters. The one to the admiral contained these words \u2014 \"Mt dear Unclb, \u2014 \"Of course you will perceive the prudence of keeping this letter to yourself, but the fact is, I have now made up my mind to leave Banner worth HaU. \" Flora Bannerworth is not now the per son she was when first I knew her and loved her. Such being the case, and she having altered, not I, she cannot accuse me of fickleness. \" I still love the Flora Bannerworth I first knew, but I cannot make my wife one who is subject to the visitations of a vam pyre. \" I have remained here long enough now to satisfy myself that this vampyre business is no delusion. I am quite convinced that it is a positive fact, and that, after death, Flora will herself become one of the horri ble existences known by that name. \"I will communicate to you from the first large city on the continent whither I am going, at which I make any stay, and in the meantime, make what excuses you like at Bannerworth HaU, which I advise you to leave as quickly a9 you can, and believe me to be, my dear uncle, yours truly, \"Chables Holland.\" \" I shall be on the continent as fast as conveyances can take me, therefore, should you entertain any romantic notions of call ing me to an account for a course of pro ceeding I think perfectly and fully justifi able, you will not find me. \" Accept the assurances of my respect for yourself, and pity for your sister, and believe me to be, my dear sir, your sincere-, friend, \" Charles Holland.\" These two letters might weU make the admiral stare at Henry Bannerworth, and Henry stare at him. An occurrence so utterly and entirely unexpected by both of them, was enough to make them doubt the evidence of their own senses. But there were the letters, as a damning evidence of the outrageous fact, and Charles Holland was gone. It was the admiral who first recovered from the stunning effect ofthe epistles, and he, with a gesture of perfect fury, ex claimed \u2014 \" The scoundrel \u2014 the cold-blooded vil lain ! I renounce bim for ever ! he is no nephew of mine ; he is some d \u2014 n impostor I Nobody with a dash of my family blood in his veins would have acted so to save him self from a thousand deaths.\" Henry's letter was this: \u2014 \"My deab Sir, \u2014 H you calmly and dispassionately consider the painfnl and distressing circumstances in which your family are placed, I am sure that, far from blaming me for the step which this note will announce to you I have taken, you will be the first to give me credit for acting with an amount of prudence and foresight which was highly necessary under the circumstances. \" If the supposed visits of a vampyre to your sister Flora had turned out, as at first I hoped they would, a delusion, and been in any satisfactory manner explained away, I should certainly have felt pride and pleasure in fulfilling my engagement to that young lady. \"You must, however, yourself feel that the amount of evidence in favour of a belief that an actual vampyre has visited Flora, enforces a conviction of its truth. \" I cannot, therefore, make her my wife under such very singular circumstances. \"Perhaps you may blame me for not taking at once advantage of the permission given me to forego my engagement when first I came to your house ; but the fact is, \" Who shaU we trust now,\" said Henry, \" when tbose whom we take to our inmost hearts deceive ns thus ? This is the greatest shock I have yet received. If there be a pang greater than another, surely it is to be found in the faithlessness and heartless ness of one we loved and trusted.\" \" He is a scoundrel !\" roared the admiral. \"D \u2014 n him, he'll die on a dunghill, and that's too good a place for him. I cast him off. I'll find him out, and old as I am, I'll fight him\u2014 I'll wring his neck, the rascal ; and as for poor dear Miss Flora, God bless her !

Oh, that I should be uncle to such a rascal!\" \" Calm yourself,\" said Henry; \"no one can blame you.\" \" Yes, you can.

THE VAUPYKE; OR, 122 pened This will kill me now \u2014 I shall die now of shame and grief.\" Tears gushed from the admiral's eyes, and the sight of the noble old man's emo tion did much to calm the anger of Henry, whicb, although he said but little, was boiling at his heart like a volcano. \" Admiral Bell,\" he said, \" you have nothing to do with this business -, we cannot blame you for the heartlessness of another. 1 have but one favour to ask of you.\" him fight you.

I have no thing now but silence and contempt.\" \" I have, though, for I'll break his neck when I see him, or he shall break mine. The villain! I'm ashamed to stay here, my young friend.\" \" How mistaken a view you take of this matter, my dear sir. As Admiral BeU, a gentleman, a brave officer, and a man of the purest and most unblemished honour, yon confer a distinction upon us by your presence here.\" Tbe Admiral wrung Henry by the hand, as he said \u2014 \" What \u2014 what can I do?\" \" Say no more about him at all.\" \"I can't help saying something about him. You ought to turn me out of the house.\" \" Heaven forbid! What for?\" \"Because I'm his uncle \u2014 his d\u2014 d old fool of an uncle, that always thought so much of bim.\" \" Nay, my good sir, that was a fault on the right sine, and cannot discredit you.

If, as we have taken occasion to say, it be a positive fact, that a noble and a gener ous mind feels more acutely any heartless ness of this description from one on whom it has placed implicit confidence, than the most deliberate and wicked of injuries from absolute strangers, we can easily conceive that Henry Bannerworth was precisely the person to feel most acutely the conduct which all circumstances appeared to fix \"The best way.

With such a bewildered sensation that he scarcely knew where be walked or whi- ther to betake himself, did he repair to his own chamber, and there he strove, with what energy he was able to bring to the task, to find out some excuses, if he could, for Charles's conduct. But he could find none : view it in what light he would, it presented but a picture ot the most heart- less selfishness it had been his lot to en- counter. The tone of the letters, too, which Charles had written, materially aggravated the moral delinquency of which he had been guilty. Better\u2014 far better, had he not attempted an excuse at all than have attempted 6uch excuses as were there put down in those epistles. A more cold-blooded, dishonourable pro- ceeding could not be well conceived. It would appear that, while he enter- tained a doubt with regard to the reality of the visitation of the vampyre to Flora Bannerworth, he had been willing to take to himself abundance of credit for the most honourable feelings, and to induce a belief in the minds of all that an exalted feeling of honour, as well as a true affection that would know no change, kept him at the feet of her whom he loved. Like some braggart, who, when there is no danger, is a very hero, but who, the moment he feels convinced he will be actually and truly called upon for an exhi- bition of his much-vannted prowess, had Charles HoHand deserted the beautiful girl, who, if anything, had now certainly, in her misfortunes, a far higher claim upon his kindly feeling than before. Henry could not sleep, although, at the request of George, who offered to keep watch for him the remainder of the night, he attempted to do so. He in vain said to himself, \" I will banish from my mind this most nnworthy subject. I have told Admiral Bell that contempt is the only feeling I can now have for his nephew, and yet I now find myself dwel- ling upon him, and upon his conduct, with a perseverance which is a foe to my re- pose.\" At length came the welcome and beau- tiful light ot day, and Henry rose, fevered and unrefresbed. His first impulse, now, was to hold a consultation with his brother George, as to what was to be done, and George ad vised that Mr. Marchale, who as yet knew nothing of the matter, should be imme- diately informed of it, and consulted, aa being probably better qualified than either of them to come to a just, a cool, and a reasonable opinion upon the painful cir cumstance, which it could not be expected that either of them would be able to view calmly. \"Let it be so, then,\" said Henry. \"Mr^ Marehdale shall decide for us.\" They at once sought this friend of the family, who was in his own bed-room ; and when Henry knocked at the door, March dale opened it hurriedly, eagerly inquiring what was the matter. \" There is no alarm,\" said Henry. \"We have only come to tell you of a circum stance which has occurred during the night, and which will somewhat surprise you.\" \" Nothing calamitous, I hope?\" \" Vexatious ; and yet, I think, it is a matter upon which we ought almost to con gratulate ourselves. Read those two letters, and give us your candid opinion upon them.\" Henry placed in Mr. Marchdale's haods the letter addressed to himself, as well as that to the admiral. Marchdale read them both with marked attention, but he did not exhibit in his countenance so much surprise as regret. When he had finished, Henry said to him \u2014 \" Well, Marchdale, what think you of this new and extraordinary episode in our affairs?\" \" My dear young friends,\" said March dale, in a voice of great emotion, \" I know not what to say to you. I have no doubtt but that you are both of you much aston ished at the receipt of these letters, and equaUy so at the sudden absence of Charles Holland.\" \" And are not you?\" \"Not so much as you, doubtless, are. Tbe fact is, I never did entertain a favour able opinion of the young man, and be knew it. I have been accustomed to tbe study of human nature under a variety ot aspects; I have made it a matter of deep, and I may add, sorrowful, contemplation, to study and remark those minor shades of character which commonly escape observa tion wholly. And, I repeat, I always had a bad opinion of Charles HoUand, which he guessed, and hence he conceived a hatred to me, which more than once, as you can not but remember, showed itself in little acts oi opposition and hostility.' ' \" You much surprise me.\" \" I expected to do so. But you cannot help remembering that at one time I was on the point of leaving here solely on his account.\""], [134, "VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE ; OR, 124 would have found yourself in the painful position of acting a hypocritical part yourself towards this Charles Holland, for you must either have kept the secret that he was suspected, or you must have shown it to him by your beha viour.\" \" Well\u2014 weU. I dare say, Marchdale, you acted for the best What shaU we do now?\" \"You were so.\" \" Indeed I should have done so, but that I reasoned with myself upon the subject, and subdued the impulse of tbe anger, which, some years ago, when I had not seen so much of the world, would have guided me.\" \" But why did you not impart to us your suspicions? We should, at least, then bave been prepared for such a contingency as has occurred.\" \"Can you doubt?\" \" I was thinking of letting Flora at once know tbe absolute and complete worthless ness of her lover, so that she could have no difficulty in at once tearing herself from him by the assistance of the natural pride which would surely come to her aid, upon finding herself so much deceived.\" \" The test may be possible.\" \"You think so?\" ' ' Place yourself in my position, and then ask yourself what you would bave done. Suspicion is one of those hideous things which all men should be most specially careful not only how they entertain at all, but how they give expression to. Besides, whatever may be the amount of one's own internal conviction with regard to tbe cha racter of any one, there is just apossibibty that we may be wrong.\" \"True\u2014 true.\" \"I do, indeed.\" \" Here is a letter, which, of course, re mains unopened, addressed to Flora by Charles Holland. The admiral rather thought it would hurt her feelings to de liver her such an epistle, but I must con fess I am ol a contrary opinion npon that point and think now the more evidence she has ot the utter worthlessness of him who professed to love her with so much disinterested affection, the better it will be for her.\" \"That possibility ought to keep anyone silent who has nothing but suspicion to go upon, however cautious it may make him, as regards his dealings with the individual. I only suspected from little minute shades of character, that would peep out in spite of him, that Charles Holland was not the honourable man he would fain have had everybody beUeve bim to be.\" \" And bad you from the first such a feeling?\" \"I had.\" \" You could not possibly, Henry, have taken a more sensible view of the subject\" \" I am glad you agree with me.\" \" No reasonable man could do otherwise, and from what I have seen of Admiral Bell, I am snre, upon reflection, he will be of the same opinion.\" \" Then it shall be so. The first shock to poor Flora may be severe, but we shall then have the consolation of knowing that it is the only one, and that in knowing the very worst, she has no more on that score to apprehend. Alas, alas ! the hand of misfortune now appears to have pressed heavily upon us indeed. What in the name of all that is unlucky and disastrous, wUl happen next, I wonder?\" \" What can happen?\" said Marchdale ; \" I think you have now got rid of the greatest evU of aU \u2014 a false friend.\" \" We have indeed.\" \" It is very strange.\" \" Yes; and what is more strange still is, that he from the first seemed to know it-, and despite a cantion which I could see he always kept uppermost in his thoughts, he could not help speaking tartly to me at times.\" \"I have noticed that,\" said George. \" You may depend it is a fact,\" added Marchdale, \" that nothing so much excites the deadly and desperate hatred of a man who is acting a hypocritical part as the suspicion, well grounded or not, that ano ther sees and understands the secret im pulses of his dishonourable heart.\" \" I cannot blame you, or any one else, Mr. Marchdale,\" said Henry, \"that you did not give utterance to your secret thoughts, but I do wish that you had done so.\" \" Go, then, to Flora ; assure her that in the affection of others who know no false hood, sbe will find a solace from every iU.

He turned aside his head to hide the traces of emotion which, despite even his great powers of self-command, would show themselves npon his handsome and intelligent countenance. Then it ap peared as if his noble indignation had got, for a few brief moments, the better of aU prudence, and he exclaimed \u2014 \"The viUain \u2014 the worse than villain! who would, with a thousand artifices, make himself beloved by a young, unsuspecting, and beautiful girl, but then to leave her to the bitterness of regret, that she had ever given snch a man a place in her esteem. The heartless ruffian!\" something which should excite indignation, and no other feeUng, in your breast.\" \" Brother, what is the meaning of this?\" said Flora, turning aside from Marchdale, and withdrawing the hand which he would have taken. \" I would rather have Admiral Bell here before I say anything,\" said Henry, \" re garding a matter in which he cannot but feel much interested personally.\" \" Here he is,\" said the admiral, who at that moment had opened the door of the breakfast-room. \" Here he is, so now fire away, and don't spare the enemy.\" \"And Charles?\" said Flora, \"where is Charles?\" \" Be calm, Mr. Marchdale, I pray yon be calm,\" said George; \" I never saw yon so much moved \" \"D\u2014n Charles !\" cried the admiral, who had not been much accustomed to con trol his feelings. \"Excuse me,\" he said, \"excuse me; I am much moved, and I am human.

Flora, here are three letters ; you wiU see that the one which is unopened is addressed to yourself. However, we wish you to read the whole three of them, and then to form your own free and unbiassed opinion.\" Flora looked as pale as a marble statue when she took the letters into her hand. She let the two that were open fall on the table before her, while sbe eagerly broke tbe seal of that which was addressed to herself. *\u25a0**!

You wiU then be able to judge by her man ner of receiving it what it wiU be best to say to her.\" \" Come, then, and pray be calm. The least that is said upon this painful and harassing subject, after this morning, wiU be the best\" Henry, with an instinctive deUcacy, beckoned every one present to the window, so that Flora had not the pain of feeUng that any eyes were fixed upon her but those of her mother, who had just come into the room, while she was perusing those docu ments which told such a tale of heartless dissimulation. \" You are right \u2014 you are right.\" Mr, Marchdale hastily put on his coat. He was dressed, with the exception of that one article of apparel, when the brothers came to his chamber, and then he came to the breakfast-parlour, where the painful communication was to be made to Flora of her lover's faithlessness. \"My dear chUd,\" said Mrs. Banner worth, \" you are ill.\" \" Hush ! mother \u2014 hush 1\" said Flora ; \" let me know aU.\" She read the whole of the letters through, and then, as the last one dropped from her grasp, she exclaimed \u2014 \" Oh, God ! oh, God ! what is all that has occurred compared to'tbis?

The expression that sat upon the coun tenances of her brothers, and of Mr. March dale, was quite sufficient to convice her that something more serious than usual had occurred, and she at the moment turned very pale. Marchdale observed this change of countenance in her, and he advanced towards her, saying \u2014 \"Flora I\" exclaimed Henry, suddenly turning from the window. \" Flora, is thin worthy of yon?\" \" Heaven now support me !\" \" Is this worthy of the name you bear, Flora? I should have thought, and I did hope, that woman's pride would have sup ported you.\" \" Let me implore you,\" added Marchdale, \" to summon indignation to your aid, Miss Bannerworth.\" \" Calm yourself, Flora, we have some thing to communicate to you, but it is a \" Charles\u2014 Charles\u2014 Charles!\" she again"], [136, "VARNEY, THE VAMYRE. 126 exclaimed, as she wrung her hands despair ingly. \" Flora, if anything could add a sting to my already irritated feelings,\" said Henry, \" this conduct of yours would.\" \"Henry \u2014 brother, what mean you?

Como along, Master Henry; you and I will consider what had best be done in this uncommonly ugly matter.\" Henry and George followed the admiral from the breakfast-room, leaving March dale, there, who looked serious, and full of melancholy thought. It was quite clear that he considered Flora had spoken from the generous warmth of her affection as regarded Charles Holland, and not from the convic tions which reason would have enforced her to feel. \"Well, then, of course, if I felt inclined, which Heaven alone knows I do not, I could not hope successfully to argue against such a conviction. But I do not wish to do so.

You believe these letters forgeries ? \"I do.\" \" And that the disappearance of Charles Holland is enforced, and not of his own free will?\" When he was now alone with her and Mrs. Bannerwortb, he spoke in a feeUng and affectionate tone regarding the painful and inexpUcable events which had tran spired. \"I do.\" \" Then you may rely upon my unremit ting exertions, night and day, to find him; and any suggestion you can make, which is likely to aid in the search, shall, I pledge myself, be fully carried out.\" \" I thank you, Mr. Marchdale.\" \"My dear,\" said the mother, \"rely on Mr. Marchdale.\" CHAPTER XXVHI.

There was nothing particular found there or in the garden. Admiral Bell pointed out accurately the route he had seen Charles take across the grass-plot just before he himself left his chamber to seek Henry. \"I would not advise anybody.\" \" Sir, if you use that as a threat\u2014\u2014\" \"A threat?\" \" Yes. I must say it sounded marvel lously like one.\" \"Oh dear, no \u2014 quite a mistake. I con sider that every man has a fair right to the cnjovment of his opinion.

This was agreed to ; for, although the young men might have chosen rather to chamber over the wall than go round, it was doubtful if the old admiral could ac complish such a feat. \" Whatever pains and penalties may be the result Admiral Bell, of differing with so infallible authority as yourself, I shall do so whenever my judgment induces me.\" \"You will?\" \"Indeed, I wilL\" \"Very good. You know the conse quences.\" \"As to fighting you, I should refuse to do so.\" The distance round, however, was not great, and as they had cast over the wall a handful of flowers from tbe garden to mark the precise spot, it was easily discoverable. The moment they reached it, they were panic-stricken by the appearances which it presented. Tbe grass was for some yards round about completely trodden up, aud converted into mud. There were deep in dentations of feet-marks in all directions, and sucb abundance of evidence that some most desperate struggle had recently taken place there, that tbe most sceptical person in the world could not have entertained any doubt upon the subject. Henry was the first to break the silence with which they each regarded the broken ground. \" This is conclusive to my mind,\" he said, with a deep sigh. \" Here has poor Charles been attacked.\" \" God help him !\" exclaimed Marchdale \" and pardon me my doubts \u2014 I am now convinced.\" The old admiral gazed about him like one distracted. Suddenly he cried\u2014 \" They have murdered him. Some fiends in the shape of men have murderod him, and Heaven only knows for what.\" \" It seems but too probable,\" said Henry. \" Let us endeavour to trace the footsteps. Oh ! Flora, Flora, what terrible news this will be to you!\" \" A horrible supposition comes across my mind,\" said George. \" What if he met the vampyre?\" \" It may have been so,\" said Marchdale, with a shudder. \" It is a point which we \"Refuse?\" \" Most certainly.\" \"Upon what ground?\" \"Upon the ground that you were a madman.\" \" Come, now,\" interposed Henry, \" let me hope that, for my sake as well as for Flora's, this dispute wiU proceed no fur ther.\" \"I have not courted it,\" said Marchdale. \" I have much temper, but I am not a stick or a stone.\" \"Damme, if I don't think,\" said the admiral, \"you are a bit of both.\" \"Mr. Henry Bannerworth,\" said March dale, \" I am your guest, and but for the duty I feel in assisting in the search for Mr. Charles Holland, I should at once leave your house.\" \" You need not trouble yourself on my account,\" said the admiral. \"If I find no clue to him ia the neighbourhood for two or three days, I shall be off myself.\" \"I am going,\" said Henry, rising, \"to search the garden and adjoining meadows; if you two gentlemen choose to come with me, I shall, of course, be happy of your company; if, however, you prefer remain ing here to wrangle, you can do so.\" This had tho effect, at all events, of putting a stop to tho dispute for the pre sent, and both the admiral and Mr. March dale accompanied Henry on his search. That search was commenced immediately"], [140, "VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE; OR, 130 should endeavour to ascertain, and I think we may do so.\" \" I have some letters from him,\" said Henry, \" which we received whilo on the continent, and I dare say Flora has like wise.\" \"How?\" \"By some inquiry as to whether Sir Francis Varney wasfrom home at midnight last night.\" \"True; that might be done.\" \" The question, suddenly put to one of his servants, would, most probably, be an swered as a thing of course.\" \" It would.\" \u2022* Then they should be compared with the alleged forgeries.\" \" I know his handwriting well,\" said the admiral. \" The letters bear so strong a resemblance to it that they would deceive anybody.\" \"Then you may depend,\" remarked Henry, \"some most deep-laid and desperate plot is going on.\" \" I begin,\" added Marchdale, \" to dread that such must be the case.

And now, my friends, since you bave some of you thought me luke-warm in this business, Ipledge myself that, should it be ascertained that Varney was from home at midnight last evening, I will defy him personally, and meet him haud to hand.\" \"Nay, nay,\" said Henry, \"leave that course to younger hands.\" \"Why so?\" \" It more befits me to be his challanger.\" \" No.Henry. You are differently situated to what I am.\" \"No plan shall be lest untried, you may depend.\" They had now reached the house, and Henry having procured some clean water, carefuUy washed the paper which had been found among the trodden grass. When freed from the mixture of clay and mud which bad obscured it, they made out the following words \u2014 \" it be so well. At the next full moon seek a convenient spot, and it can be done. The signature is, to my apprehension, perfect The money, which I hold, in my opinion, is much more in amount than you imagine, must be ours; and as for \" Here the paper was torn across, and no further words were visible upon it. Mystery seemed now to be accumulating upon mystery; each one, as it showed itself darkly, seeming to bear some remote rela tion to what preceded it ; and yet only confusing it the more. That this apparent scrap of a letter had dropped from some one's pocket during the fearful struggle, of which there were such ample evidences, was extremely probable ; but what it related to, by whom it was written, or by whom dropped, were un fathomable mysteries. In fact, no one could give an opinion upon these matters at all ; and after a fur ther series of conjectures, it could only be decided, that, unimportant as the scrap of paper appeared now to be, it should be preserved, in case it should, as there was a dim possibility that it might, become a connecting link in some chain of evidence at another time. \"How so?\" \" Remember, that I am in the world a lone man ; without ties or connexions. If I lose my life, I compromise no one by my death ; but you have a mother and a be reaved sister to look to who well deserve your care.\" \"HiUoa,\" cried the admiral, \"what's this?\" \" What ?\" cried each, eagerly, and they pressed forward to where the admiral was stooping to the ground to pick up something which was nearly completely trodden into the grass. He with some difficulty raised it. It was a small slip of paper, on which was some writing, but it was so much covered with mud as not to be legible. \" If this be washed,\" said Henry, \" I think we 6haU be able to read it clearly.\" \" We can soon try that experiment, \"said George. \" And as the footsteps, by some mysteriousmeans, show themselves nowhere else but in this one particular spot, any further pursuit of inquiry about here appears useless.\" \"Then we wUl return to the house,\" said Henry, \" and wash the mud from this paper.\" \" There is one important point,\" re marked Marchdale, \" which it appears to me we have all overlooked.\" \" Indeed !\" \"Yes.\" \" -And here we are,\" said Henry, \" com pletely at fault, and knowing not what to do.\" \"What may that be?\" \" It is this.

The servants answered me at once, and so frankly that I cannot doubt it.\" The door of the room was slowly opened, and Flora came in. She looked almost the shadow of what she had been but a few weeks before. She was beautiful, but she almost realised the poet's description of one who had suffered much, and was sinking into an early grave, the victim of a broken heart: \u2014 \" Boldly.\" \"How boldly?\" \" By going at once, I should advise, to his house, and asking the first one of his domestics you may happen to see.\" \" I will go over,\" cried George; \" on 6uch occasions as these one cannot act upon ceremony.\" He seized his hat and without waiting for a word from any one approving or con demning his going, off he went\" \" If,\" said Henry, \" we find that Varney has nothing to do with the matter, we are completely at fault.\" \" Completely,\" echoed Marchdale. \" In that case, admiral, I think we ought to defer to your feelings upon the subject, and do whatever you suggest should be done.\" \"She was more beautiful than death, And yet as sad to look upon.\" Her face was of a marble paleness, and as she clasped her hands, and glanced from face to face, to see if she could gather hope and consolation from the expression of any one, she might have been taken for some exquisite statue of despair. \" Have you found him?\" she said. \" Have you found Charles?\" \" Flora, Flora,\" said Henry, as he ap proached her. \" Nay, answer me; have you found him? You went to seek him. Dead or ahve, have you found him?\" \" We have not, Flora.\" \" Then I must seek him myself. None will search for him as I will search; I must myself seek him. 'Tis true affec tion that can alone be successful in such a search.\" \" I shall offer a hundred pounds reward to any one who can and will bring any news of Charles.\" \" A hundred pounds is too much,\" said Marchdale. \" Not at all ; and while I am about it, since the amount is made a subject of dis cussion, I shall make it two hundred, and that may benefit some rascal who is not so well paid for keeping the secret as I will pay bim for disclosing it\" \"Perhaps you are right,\" said March dale. \" BeUeve me, dear Flora, that all has been done which the shortness of the time that has elapsed would permit. Further measures wiU now immediately be taken. Rest assured, dear sister, that aU will be done that the utmost zeal can suggest.\" \" They have kiUed him I they have killed him!\" she said, mournfully. \"Oh, God, they have kiUed him ! I am not now mad, but the time will come when I must surely be maddened. The vampyre has kUled Charles Holland\u2014 the dreadful vampyre !\" \" I know I am, as I always am.\" Marchdale could not forbear a smile at the opiniated old man, who thought no one's opinion upon any subject at aU equal to his own ; but. he made no remark, and only waited, as did Henry, with evident anxiety for the return of George. The distance was not great, and George certainly performed his errand quickly, for he was back in less time than they had thought be could return in. The moment he came into the room, he said, without waiting for any inquiry to be made of him \u2014 \" Nay, now, Flora, this is frenzy.\" \" Because he loved me has he been des- troyed. I know it, I know it. The vam pyre has doomed me to destruction. I am lost, and all who loved me will be in volved in one common ruiu on my ac count. Leave me, all of you, to perish.

I will set every means in operation that I possibly can to discover him.

The ruins covered a considerable extent of ground, but the only part which seemed successfuUy to have resisted the encroaches of time, at least, to a considerable extent, was a long hall, in which the joUy monks no doubt feasted and caroused. Adjoining to this hall, were the walls of other parts of the bufiding, and at several places there were small, low, mysterious looking doors that led, heaven knows where, into some intricacies and labyrinths beneath the building, whicb no one had, within the memory of man, been content to run the risk of losing himself in. It was related that among these subter ranean passages and arches there were pit faUsand pools of water; and whether such a statement was true or not, it certainly acted as a considerable damper upon the vigour of curiosity. This ruin was so well known in the neighbourhood, and had become from earliest childhood so familiar to the in habitants of Bannerworth Hall, tbat one would as soon expect an old inhabitant of Lndgate-hiU to make some remark about St. Paul's, as any of them to allude to the ruins of Monks' Hall. They never now thought of going near to it, for in infancy they had sported among itsuirins, and it had become one of those familiar objects which almost, from that vary famUiarity, cease to hold a place in the memory of those who know it so well.

Some dis- tance from the Hall, which, from time im memorial, had been the home and the property of the liannerworth family, was an ancient ruin known by the name of the Hall. It is evening\u2014 the evening of that first day of heart loneliness to poor Flora Ban nerworth.

Tho edges of the de cayed stones seem now to be tipped with gold, and as the rich golden refulgence of light gleams upon the painted glass which still adorned a large window of the hall, a flood of many-ccloured beautifnl light was cast within, making the old flagstones, with which the interior was paved, look more like some rich tapestry, laid down to do honour to a monarch. had not more to do with the matter than reality. From out a portion of the rnins that was enveloped in the deepest gloom, thcro now gUdes a figure. It is of gigantic height and it moves along with a slow and mea sured tread. An ample mantle envelops the form, which might well havo been taken for the spirit of one of the raonke, who, centuries since, had made that placo their home. It walked the whole length of the ample hall we have alluded to, and then, at the window from which had streamed the long flood of many-coloured light, it paused. For more than ten minutes this mysteri ous-looking figure there stood. At length there passed something on the outside of the window, that looked like the shadow of a human form. Then the tall, mysterious, apparition looking man turned, and sought a side entrance to the haU. So picturesque and so beautiful an aspect did the ancient ruin wear, that to one with a soul to appreciate the romantic and the beautiful, it would have amply repaid the fatigue ofa long journey now to see it. And as the sun sank to rest, the gorge ous colours that it cast upon the moulder ing wall deepened from an appearance of burnished gold to a crimson hue, and from that again the colour changed to a shifting purple, mingling with the shadows of the evening, and so gradually fading away into absolute darkness. Then he paused, and, in about a minnte, he was joined by another, who must have been be who had so recently passed the stained-glass window on the outer side. There was a friendly salutation between these two beings, and they walked to the centre cf the hall, where they remained for some time in animated conversation. The place is as silent as the tomb \u2014 a silence far more solemn than could have existed, had there been no remains of a human habitation ; because even these time-worn walls were suggestive of what once had been ; and the wrapt stillness which now pervaded them brought with them a melancholy feeling for the past There was not even the low hum of in sect life to break the stillness of these ancient ruins. From the gestures they used, it was evi dent that the subject of their discourse was one of deep and absorbing interest to both It was one. too, upon which, after a time, they seemed a little to differ, and more than once they each assumed attitudes of mutual defiance. And now tho last rays of the sun are gradually fading away. In a short time nil will be darkness. A low, gentle wind is getting np, and beginning slightly to stir the tall blades of grass that have shot up between some of the old stones. The silence is broken, awfully broken, by a sudden cry of despair; such a cry as might come from some imprisoned spirit, doomed to waste an age of horror in a tomb. And yet it was scarcely to be caUed a scream, and not all a groan. It might have come from some one on the moment of some dreadful sacrifice, when the judgment had not sufficient time to call courage to its aid, but involuntarUy had induced that sound which might not be repeated. A few startled birds flew from odd holes and corners about the ruins, to seek some other place of rest. The owl hooted from a corner of what had once been a belfry, and a dreamy-looking bat flew out Irom a cranny, and struck itself headlong against a projection. Then all was still again. Silence re sumed its reign, and if there had been a mortal car to drink in that sudden sound, slie mind might weU have doubted if fancy This continued until the sun had so completely sunk, that twilight was begin ning sensibly to wane, and then gradually the two men appeared to have come to a better understanding, and whatever might be the subject of their discourse, there was some positive result evidently arrived at now. They spoke in lower tones. They used less animated gestures than before; and, after a time, they both walked slowly down the hall towards the dark spot from whence the first tall figure had so mysteri ously emerged. **\u2022*\u00bb** There is a dungeon \u2014 damp and full of the most unwholesome exhalations \u2014 deep under ground it seems, and, in its excava tions, it would appear as if some small land springs had been liberated, for the earthern floor was one continued extent of mois ture.

The creaking of a door follows \u2014 a gleam of light shines into the dungeon, and the tall, mysterious- looking figure in the cloak stands before the occupant of that wretched place. Then comes in the other man, and he carries in his hand writing materials. He stoops to the stone couch on which the prisoner lies, and offers him a pen, as he raises him partially from the miserable damp pallet. But there is no speculation in the eyes of that oppressed man. In vain the pen is repeatedly placed in his grasp, and a document of some length, written on parchment, spread out before him to sign. In vaip is he held up now by both the men, who have thus mysteriously sought him in his dungeon. He has not tbe power to do as they would wish him. The pen falls from his nerveless grasp, and, with a deep sigh, when they cease to hold him up, he falls heavily back upon the stone couch.

The black ness of a night unillumined by rhe moon, which would not now rise for some hours, was upon the ancient ruins. All was calm and stUl, and no one would have supposed that aught human was within those ancient, dreary-looking walls. Time will show who it was that lay in that unwholesome dungeon, as well as who were they who visited him so mysteriously, and retired again with feelings of such evi dent disappointment with tho document it seemed of such importance, at least to one of them, to get that unconscious man to sign.

THE VISIT OP FLORA TO THE VAMPYRE. \u2014 TUB OFFER. \u2014 THE SOLEMN ASSEVERATION. dmiral Bell had, ot course, nothing parti cular to com- municate to Flora in the walk he in- duce her to take with him in the gardens ot Banner worth Hall, but he could talk to her upon a subject which was sure to be a welcome one, namely, of Charles Holland. And not only could he talk to her of Charles, but he was willing to talk of him in the style of enthusiastic commendation which assimilated best with her own feel ings. No one but the honest old admiral, who was as violent in his likes and his dis likes as any one could possibly be, conld just then have conversed with Flora Ban nerworth to her satisfaction of Charles Holland. \" D n !\" The reply of the other was a laugh ; and then he took the light from the floor, and motioned the one who seemed so little able to control his feelings of bitterness and dis appointment to leave the place with him. With a haste and vehemence, then, which showed how much angered he was, the shorter man of the two now roUed up the parchment, and placed it iu a breast pocket of his coat. But when they reached the door of the dungeon, the taller man of the two paused, and appeared for a moment or two .to be in deep thought, after which he handed the lamp he carried to bis companion, and approached the pallet of the prisoner. He took from his pocket a small bottle ; and, raising the head of the feeble and wounded man, he poured some portion of the contents into his mouth, and watched him swallow it. He expressed no doubts whatever con cerning Charles's faith ; and, to his mind, now that he had got that opinion firmly fixed in his mind, everybody that held a contrary one he at once denounced as a fool or a rogue. \"Never you mind, Miss Flora,\" he said; \"you will find, I dare say, that all will come right eventually. Damme, the only thing that provokes me in the whole busi ness is, that I should have been such an old fool as for a moment to doubt Charles.\""], [147, "THE FEAST OF BLOOD. 137 \"You should have known him better, courageous, you must likewise grant how much we are doomed to suffer from the dangers of those whom we esteem.\" \" You would be the last person in the world to esteem a coward.\" sir.\" \" I should, my dear; but I was taken by surprise, you see ; and that was wrong, too, for a man who has held a responsible command.\" \" But the circumstances, dear sir, were of a nature to take every one by surprise.\" \" They were \u2014 they were.

Then here goes at once. Your brother Henry, poor feUow, has enough to do, has he not, to make both ends meet?\" A flush of excitement came over Flora's cheek, as the old admiral thus bluntly broached a subject of which she already knew the bitterness to such a spirit as her brother's. \" I'U be hanged if I know. I do feel tolerably sure, and I have a good deal of reliance upon your opinion, my dear. I say, I do feel tolerably sure ; but if I was d\u2014 d sure, now, I'd soon have it out of him.\" \" For my sake, Admiral Bell, I wish now to extract one promise from you.\" \" Say your say, my dear, and I'U pro mise you.\" \" You wUl not, then, expose yourself to the danger of any personal conflict with that most dreadful man, whose powers of mischief we do not know, and, therefore, cannot weU meet or appreciate.\" \"Whew! Is that what you mean?\" \" Yes : you will, I am sure, promise me so much.\" \" You are sUent,\" continued the old man; \" by that I guess I am not wrong in my supposition ; indeed, it is hardly a supposi tion at all, for Master Charles told me as much, and no doubt he had it from a cor rect quarter.\" \" I cannot deny it, sir.\" \"Then don't. It ain't worth denying, my dear. Poverty is no crime, but, like being born a Frenchman, it's a d \u2014 d mis fortune.\" Flora could scarcely refuse a snule, as the nationality of the old admiral peeped out even in the midst of his most Uberal and best feehngs. \"Why, my dear, you see the case is this. In affairs of fighting, the less ladies interfere the better.\" \"Nay, why so?\" \"Because\u2014 because, you see, a lady has no reputation for courage to keep up. Indeed, it's rather the other way, for we dislike a bold woman as much as we hold in contempt a cowardly man.\" \" But if you grant to us females that, in consequence of our affections, we are not"], [148, "VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE; OR, 138 please \u2014 it's yours, and I have no right aud no incUnation to ask you what use you put it to.\" Tears gushed from the eyes of Flora, as she tried to utter some word, but could not. The admiral swore rather fearfuUy, and pretended to wonder much what on earth she could be crying for. At length, aster the first gush of feeling was over, she said \u2014 \"I cannot accept of so much generosity, sir \u2014 I dare not.\" \"Well,\" he continued, \" I don't intend that he shall have so much trouble as he has had. The enemies of his king and his country shall free him from his embar rassments.\" \" The enemies?\" \"Yes; who else?\" \" You speak in riddles, sir.\" \" Do I? Then I'll soon make the rid dles plain. When I went to sea I was worth nothing\u2014 as poor as a ship's cat af ter the crew had been paid off for a month. Well, I began fighting away as hard and fast aa I could, and the more I fought, and the more hard knocks I gave and took, the more money I got.\" \"Indeed!\" \"Yes; prize after prize we hauled into port, and at last the French vessels wouldn't come out of their harbours.\" \" Wbat did you do then?\" \"What did we do then? Why, what was the most natural thing in the whole world for us to do, we did.\" \"I cannot guess.\" \" WeU, I am surprised at that. Try again.\" \" Oh, yes ; I can guess now. How could I have been so duU? You went and took them out.\" \"Dare not!\" \"No; I should think meanly of myself were I to take advantage of the boundless munificence of your nature.\" \" Take advantage ! I should like to see anybody take advantage of me, that's aU.\" \" I ought not to take the money of you. I will speak to my brother, and weU I know how much he will appreciate the noble offer, my dear sir.\" \" WeU, settle it your own way, only re member I bave a right to do what I Uke with my own money.\" \" Undoubtedly.\" \" Very good. Then as that is un doubted, whatever I lend to him, mind, I give to you, so it's as broad as it's long, as the Dutchman said, when he looked at the new ship that was built for him, and you may as weU take it yourself, you see, and make no more fuss about it.\" \"I will consider,\" said Flora, with much emotion ; \" between this time and the same hour to-morrow I wiU consider, sir, and if you can find any words more expressive of heartfelt gratitude than others, pray ima gine that I have used them with reference to my own feelings towards you for such an unexampled offer of friendship.\" \" Oh, bother\u2014 stuff.\" The admiral now at once changed the subject, and began to talk of Charles \u2014 a most grateful theme to Flora, as may well be supposed. He related to her many Uttle particulars connected with him, which all tended to place his character in a most amiable light, and as her ears drank in the words of commendation of him sbe loved, what sweeter music could there be to her than the voice of the old weather-beaten, rongh-spoken man? \" The idea,\" he added to a warm eulo gium he had uttered concerning Charles \u2014 \" the idea that he could write those letters, my dear, is quite absurd.\" \" It is, indeed. Oh, tbat we could know what has become of him !\" \"We shall know. I don't think but what he's alive. Something seems to as sure me that we shall some of these days look upon his face again.\" \"To be sure wo did \u2014 to be sure we did, my dear; that's how we managed them. And, do you see, at the end of the war 1 found myself with lots of prize money, aU wrung from old England's enemies, and I intend that some of it shall find its way to your brother's pocket; and, you see, that wiU bear out just what I said, that the enemies of his king and country shall free him from his difficulties \u2014 don't you see?\" \" I see your noble generosity, admiral.\" \" Noble fiddlestick ! Now I have men tioned this matter to you, my dear, and I don't so much mind talking to you about such matters as I should to your brother, I want you to dome the favour of managing it aU for me.\" \" How, sir?\" \" Why, just this way. You must find out how much money will free your brother just now from a parcel of botherations that beset him, and then I will give it you, and you can hand it to him, you see, so 1 need not say anything about it; and if he speaks to me on the subject at all, I can put bim down at once by saying, ' avast there, it's no business of mine.' \" \" And can you, dear admiral, imagine that I could conceal the generous source from where so much assistance came?\" \"Of course; it wiU come from you. I take a fancy to make you a present of a sum of money ; you do with it what you"], [149, "THE FEAST OF BLOOD. 139 * I am rejoiced to hear you say so.\" \" We will stir heaven and earth to find him. If he were killed, do you see, there would have been some traces of him now at hand; besides, he would have been left lying where the rascals attacked him.\" Flora shuddered. \"But don't you fret yourself. Yon ro ay depend that the sweet little cherub that sits up aloft has looked after him.\" \" I wUl hope so.\" \" And now, my dear, Master Henry wUl soon be home, I am thinking, and as he has quite enough disagreeables on his own mind to be able to spare a few of them; you wUl take the earUest opportunity, I am sure, of acquainting bim with the little matter we have been talking about, and let me know what he says.\" \" I wUl\u2014 I will.\" \"That's right. Now, go in doors, for there's a cold air blowing here, and you are a delicate plant rather just now\u2014 go in and make yourself comfortable and easy. The worst storm must blow over at last.'' ject was visible. It was that pitchy dark ness without, whicb, for some hours, when the moon is late in lending ber reflected beams, comes over the earth's surface. \" It is near the hour,\" he muttered. \" It is now very near the hour ; surely he wiU come; and yet I know not why I should fear him, although I seem to trem ble at the thought of his approach. He will surely come. Once a year \u2014 only once does he visit me, and then 'tis but to take the price which he has compelled me to pay for that existence, whicb, but for him, had been long since terminated. Sometimes I devoutly wish it were.\" With a shudder, he returned to the seat he had so recently left, and there for some time he appeared to meditate in sUence. Suddenly, now, a clock, which was in the hall of that mansion he had purchased, sounded the hour loudly. \" The time has come,\" said Sir Francis. \" The time has come. He wiU surely soon be here. Hark\u2014 hark!\" Slowly and distinctly he counted the strokes of the clock; and, when they had ceased, he exclaimed, with sudden sur prise \u2014 \"Eleven! But eleven! How bave I been deceived ? I thought the hour of midnight was at hand.\" He hastily consulted tbe watch he wore, and then he, indeed, found that whatever he had been looking forward to with dread for some time past as certain to ensue, at or about twelve o'clock, had yet another hour in which to prey upon his imagination. \" How could I have made so grievous an error?\" he exclaimed. \" Another hour of suspense and wonder as to whether that man be among the hving or the dead. I have thought of raising my hand against his life, but some strange mysterious feeling has always staid me, and I have let him come and go freely, while an opportunity might well have served me to put such a design into execution. He is old, too\u2014 very old; and yet he keeps death at a distance. He looked pale, but far from unwell or sidl ing, when last I saw him. Alas! a whole hour yet to wait. I would that this inter view were over.\" That extremely weU known and popular disease, called the fidgets, now began, in deed, to torment Sir Francis Varney. He could not sit\u2014 he could not walk ; and, somehow or another, he never once seemed to imagine that from the wine-cup he should experience any relief, although, upon a side-table, there stood refreshments of that character. And thus some more time passed away, and he strove to cheat it of its weariness by thinking of a variety CHAPTER XXXI. SIR FRANCIS VARNEY AND HIS MYSTERI- OUS VISITOR. \u2014 THE STRANGE CONFER- ENCE. Sir Francis Varney is in what he caUs his own apartment It is night, and a dim and uncertain light from a candle, which has been long neglected, only serves to render obscurity more perplexing. The room is a costly one. One replete with all the appliances of refinement and luxury which the spirit and the genius of the age could possibly supply him with ; but there is upon his brow the marks of corroding care, and Uttle does that most mysterious being seem to care for aU the rich furnish ing of that apartment in which he sits. His cadaverous-looking face is even paler and more death-Uke-looking than usual; and, if it can be conceived possible that such an one can feel largely interested in human affairs, to look at him, we could weU suppose that some interest of no com mon magnitude was at stake. Occasionally, too, he muttered some un connected words, no doubt mentally filling up the gaps, which rendered the sentences incomplete ; and being unconscious, per haps, that he was giving audible utterance to any of his dark and secret meditations. At length he rose, and with an anxious expression of countenance, he went to the window, and looked out into the darkness of the night All was still, and not an ob-"], [150, "VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE ; OR, 140 and at some little distance were many of the domestics, who were not denied the privilege of warmth aud rest in the pre sence of their master. of subjects; but as the fates would have it there seemed not oneagreeable reminiscence in the mind of that most inexplicable man, and the more he plunged into the recesses of memory the more uneasy \u2014 not to say almost terrified \u2014 he looked and became. A shuddering nervousness came across him, and, for a few moments, he sat as if he were upon the point of fainting. By a vigorous effort, however, he shook this off, and then placing before him the watch, which now indicated about the quarter past eleven, he strove with a calmer aspect to wait the coming of bim whose presence, when he did come, would really be a great terror, since the very thought beforehand produced so much hesitation and apparent dismay. In order, too, if possible, then to further withdraw himself from a too painful con sideration of those terrors, which in due time the reader will be acquainted with the cause of, be took up a book, and plunging at random into its contents, he amused his mind for a time with the foUowing brief narrative : \u2014 These were not the times when, if ser vants sat down, they were deemed idle ; but the daily task done, then the evening hour was spent by the fire-side. \" The wind howls aud moans,\" .said an aged domestic, \" in an awfUl manner. I never heard the like.\" \" It seems as though some imprisoned spirits were waUing for the repose that had been denied on earth,\" said the old lady, as she shifted her seat, and gazed steadily on the fire. \" Ay,\" said her aged companion, \" it is a windy night, and there wUl be a storm before long, or I'm mistaken.\" \" It was just such a night as this that my son Henry left his home,\" said Mrs. Bradley \u2014 \"just such another, only it had tbe addition of sleet and rain.\" The old man sighed at the mention of his son's name : a tear stood in the eyes of the maidens, while one looked silently at the other, and seemed to exchange glances. \" I would that I might again see him before my body seeks its final home in the cold remorseless grave.\" \" Mother,\" said the fairest of the two maidens, \" do not talk thus. Let us hope tbat we yet may have many years of hap piness together.\" \" Many, Emma?\" \" Yes, mamma, many.\" \" Do you know that I am very old, Emma \u2014 very old, indeed, considering what I have suffered. Such a Use of sorrow and ill-health is, at least equal to thirty years added to my life.\" \" You may have deceived yourself, aunt,\" said the other maiden. \" At all events, you cannot count upon Use as cer tain, for the strongest often go first while those who seem much more likely to faU, by care, as often live in peace and happi ness.\" The wind howled round the gable ends of Bridport House in sudden and furious gusts, while the inmates sat by the fire-side, gazing in silence upon the blazing embers of the huge fire, that shed a red and bright Ught all over the immense apartment in which they aU sat. It was an ancient-looking place, very large, and capable of containing a number of guests. Several were present. An aged couple were seated in tall, high, straight-backed chairs. They were the owners of that lordly mansion, and near them sat two young maidens of surpassing beauty : they were dissimilar and yet there was a slight likeness, but of Wtally different complexions. The one had tresses of raven black; eye brows, eyelashes, and eyes were all of the same hue. She was a beautiful and proud looking girl, her complexion clear, with the hue of health upon her cheeks, while a smile played around her lips. The glance of the eye was sufficient to thriU through tbe whole soul. \" But I lead no Use of peace and happi ness while Henry Bradley is not here; besides, my life might be passed without me seeing him again.\" \" It is now two years since he was here last,\" said the old man. \"This night two years was the night on wbich he left.\" The other maiden was altogether dif ferent : her complexion altogether fairer \u2014 her hair of sunny chestnut, and her beau tiful hazel eyes were shaded by long brown eyelashes, while a playful smile also lit up her countenance. She was the younger of the two. \" Thi* -' -' \u2022 . -vi T*-*irs?\" The attention of the two young maidens had been directed to the words of the aged owner of the house, for he had been speaking a few moments before. There were several other persons present, \" It was this night two years,\" said one of the servant men, \" because old Dams Poutlet had twins on that night.\" \" A memorable circumstance.\" \" And one died at a twelvemonth old,\""], [151, "THE FEAST OF BLOOD. 141 said the man, \" and she had a dream which foretold the event\" \"Ay, ay.\" \"Yes; and, moreover, she's had the same dream again last Wednesday was a week,\" said the man. \" And lost the other twin?\" upon your obedienee; but when I do so, I expect tbat you will obey me.\" \" But, father, this matter affects me for my whole Use.\" \" That is why I have deliberated so long and carefully over it.\" \" But it is not unreasonable that I should have a voice in the affair, father, since it may render me miserable.\" \" You shaU have a voice.\" \"Yes, sir\u2014 this morning.\" \"Omens multiply,\" said the aged man. \" I would that it would seem to indicate the return of Henry to his home.\" \" I wonder where he can have gone to, or what he could have done all this time. Probabably, he may not be in the land of the Uving.\" .> \" Poor Henry!\" said Emma. \" Alas, poor boy ! We may never see him again. It was a mistaken act of his ; and yet he knew not otherwise how to act or escape his father's displeasure.\" '' Then I say no to the whole regulation,\" said Henry decisively. \" If you do so, you forfeit my protection, much more favour. But you had better consider over what you have said. Forget it, and come with me.\" \" I cannot.\" \"You will not?\" \" No, father ; I cannot do as you wish me, my mind is fully made up upon that matter.\" \" Say no more \u2014 say no more upon that subject. I dare not listen to it God knows I know quite enough !\" said Mr. Bradley. \" I knew not he would have taken my words so to heart as he did.\" \" And so is mine. You either do as I would have you, or you leave the house, and seek your own living, and you are a beggar.\" \" I should prefer being such/'said Henry, \" than to marry any young lady, and be unable to love her.\" \" Why,\" said the old woman, \" he thought you meant what you said.\" There was a long pause, during which all gazed at the blazing fire, seemingly wrapt in their own meditation. \" That is not required.\" \" No ! I am astonished ! Not neces- sary to love the woman you marry !\" \"Not at all; if you act justly towards her she ought to he grateful; and it is all that is requisite in the marriage state. Gratitude wiU beget love, and love in one begets love in the other.\" Henry Bradley, the son of the apparently aged couple, had left that day two years. And wherefore had he left the home of his chUdhood? Wherefore had he, the heir to large estates, done this? He had dared to love without his father's leave, and had refused tht offer his father made him of marrying a young lady whom he had chosen for him, but whom he could not love. \" I wiU not argue with you, father, upon tbe matter. You are a better judge than I ; you have had more experience.\" \" I have.\" \" And it would be useless to speak npon the subject; but of this I can speak \u2014 my own resolve \u2014 that I wUl not marry the lady in question.\" The son had aU the stern resolve of the father, but he also had very good reasons for what he did. He loved, aud was be loved in return ; and hence he would not break his faith with her whom he loved. It was as much a matter of surprise to the father that the son should refuse as it was to the son that his father should con template such a match. \" Henry,\" said the father. \" you have been thought of by me. I have made pro- posals for marrying you to the daughter of our neighbour, Sir Arthur Onslow.\" \" Indeed, father !\" \" Yes. I wish you to go there with me to see the young lady.\" \" In the character of a suitor?\" \"Yes,\" replied the father, \"certainly. Iss high time you were settled.\" \" Indeed, I would rather not go, father. I have no intention of marrying just yet. I do not desire to do so.\" This was an opposition that Mr. Bradley had not expected from his son, and which his imperious temper could UI brook, and with a darkened brow he said \u2014 To have explained this to his father would have been to gain nothing except an acces sion of anger, and he would have made a new demand upon his (the son's) obedience. by ordering him to discard from his bosom the image that was there indeUbly en graven. \" You wdl not marry her whom I have chosen for your bride?\" \" I cannot.\" \" Do not talk to me of can and can't, when I speak of wiU and won't. It is use less to disguise the fact. You have your \" It is not much, Henry, that I trespass"], [152, "144 VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE. free will in the matter. I shall take no answer but yes or no.\" \"Then, no, father.\" \" Good, sir; and now we are strangers.\" With that Mr. Bradley turned abruptly from his son, and left him to himself. It was the first time they had bad any words or difference together, and it was sudden and soon terminated. Henry Bradley was indignant at what aad happened; he did not think his father would have acted as he had done in this in stance ; but he was too much interested in the fate of another to hesitate for a moment. Then came the consideration as to what he should do, now that he had arrived at such a climax. His first thoughts turned to his mother and sister. He could not leave the bouse without giving them good-bye. He de termined to see his mother, for his father had left the hall upon a visit. Mrs. Bradley and Emma were alone when he entered their apartment, and to them he related all that had passed between himself and father. They besought him to stay, to remain there, or at least in the neighbourhood ; but he was resolved to quit the place altogether for a time, as he could do nothing there, aud he might chance to do something else where. Upon this, they got together all the money and such jewels as they could spare, which in all amounted to a considerable sum ; then taking an affectionate leave of bis mother and sister, Henry left the Hall \u2014 not before he had taken a long and affectionate farewell of one other who lived within those walls. This was no other than the raven-eyed tnaiden who sat by the fire-side, and listened attentively to the conversation that was going on. She was his love \u2014 she, a poor cousin. For her sake he had braved all his father's anger, and attempted to seek his fortune abroad. This done, he quietly left the Hall, with out giving any one any intimation of where he was going Old Mr. Bradley, when he had said so much to his son, was highly incensed at what he deemed his obstinacy ; and he thought the threat hanging over him would have had a good effect ; but he was amazed when he discovered that Henry had indeed left the Hall, and he knew not whither. For some time he comforted himself with the assurance that he would, he must return ; but, alas ! he came not, and this was the second anniversary of that melancholy day, which no one more repented of and grieved for, than did poor Mr. Bradley. \" Surely, surely he will return, or let us know where he is,\" he said ; \" he cannot be in need, else he would have written to as for aid.\" \"No, no,\" said Mrs. Bradley; \"it is, I fear, because he has not written, that he is in want ; he would never write if he was in poverty, lest he should cause us unhappi ness at his fate. Were he doing well, we should hear of it, for he would be proud of the result of his own unaided exertions.\" \" Well, well\" said Mr. Bradley, \" I can say no more ; if I was hasty, so was he; but it is passed. I would forgive all the past, if I could but see him once again\u2014 once again !\" \" How the wind howls,\" added the aged man ; \" and it's getting worse and worse.\" \" Yes, and the snow is coming down now in style,\" said one of the servants, who brought in some fresh logs, which were piled up on the fire, and he shook the white flakes off his clothes. \" It will be a heavy fall before morning,\" said one of the mci \"Yes, it has been gathering for some days; it it will bo much w\u00ab\u00abner than it has been when it is all down.* \"So it will\u2014 so it will.\" At that moment there was a Knocking at the gate, and the dogs burst into a dresiful uproar from their kenneR \" Go, Robert,\" said Mr. Bradley, \" aa< see who it is that knocks such a night as this : it is not fit or safe that a dog should be out in it.\" The man went out, and shortly returned, saying\u2014 \" So please you, sir, there is a traveller that has missed his way, and desires to know if he can obtain shelter here, or if any one can be found to guide him to the nearest inn.\" \"Bid him come in ; we shall lose no warmth because there is one more before the fire.\" The stranger entered, and said\u2014 \" I have missed my way, and the snow comes down so thick and fast, and is whirled in such eddies, that I fear, by my self, I should fall into some drift, and perish before morning.\" \"Do not speak of it, sir,\" said Mr. Bradley ; \" such a night as this is a suf ficient apology for the request you make, and an inducement to me to grant it most willingly.\" \"Thanks,\" replied the stranger; \"the welcome is most seasonable.\" \"Be seated, sir; take your seat by the ingle; it is warm.\" The stranger seated himself, and seemed lost in reflection, as he gazed intently on"], [153, "143 VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE ; OR, THE FEAST OF BLOOD, THE VISIT OV THE UNKNOWN TO SIR FRANCIS VARNEY. \"Yes; I have not been in this country moie than six days.\" \" Indeed.

Bring him here! It is \u2014 an \u2014 old friend \u2014 of mine.\" He sank into a chair, and still he kept his eyes fixed upon that door through which his visitor must come. Surelyiome secret of droadful moment must be con nected with him whom Sir Francis ex pected \u2014 dreaded\u2014 and yet dared not refuse to see. And now a footstep approaches \u2014 a slow and a 6olemn footstep\u2014 it pauses a moment at the door of the apartment, and then the servant flings it open, and a tall man enters. He is enveloped in the folds of a horseman's cloak, and there is the clank of spurs upon his heels as he walks into the room. Varney rose again, but he said not a word ; and for a few moments they stood opposite each other in silence. The do mestic has left the room, and the door is closed, so that there was nothing to prevent them from conversing; and, yet, sUent they continued for some minutes. It seemed as if each was most anxious the other should commence the conversation first. \" Oh !\" said the stranger, softly, \" dif ferences and mistakes will happen now and then, when least desired.\" At this moment, au old hound, who had lain beside EUen Mowbray, she who wore the coal-black tresses, lifted his head at the difference in sound tbat was noticed in the stranger's voice. He got up and slowly walked up to him, and began to smell around him, and, in another mo ment, he rushed at him with a cry of joy, and began to lick and caress him in the most extravagant manner. This was fol lowed by a cry of joy from all present. \"It is Henry!\" exclaimed Ellen Mow bray, rising and rushing into his arms. It was Henry, and he threw off the several coats he bad on, as well as the large beard he wore to disguise himself. The meeting was a happy one; there was not a more joyful house than that within many miles around, Henry was restored to the arms of those who loved him, and, in a month, a wedding was celebrated between him and his cousin Ellen. * * * * And yet there was nothing so very re markable in the appearance of that stranger, which should entirely justify Sir Francis Varney iu feeling so much alarm at his presence. He certainly was a man past the prime of life ; and he looked like one who had battled much with misfortune, and as if time had not passed so lightly over his brow, but tbat it had left deep traces oi its progress. The only thing positively bad about his countenance, was to be found in his eyes. There there was a most ungracious and suspicious look, as if he were always re solving in his mind some deep-laid scheme, which might be sufficient to circumvent the whole of mankind. Finding, probably, that Varney would not speak first, he let his cloak fill more loosely about him, and in a low, deep tone, he said \u2014 \" I presume I was expected?\" \" You were,\" said Vamey. \" It is the day, and it is the hour.\" \" You are right. I like to see you so mindful. You don't improve in looks since \" \"Hush\u2014 hush ! no more of that; can we not meet without a dreadful aUusion to the past?

I see it all before my mind's eye, coming in frightful panoramic array, those incidents which, even to dream of, are sufficient to drive thesoul to madness; the dread of this annual visit hangs upon me Uke a dark cloud upon my very heart; it sits like some foul incubus, destroying its vitaUty, and dragging me, from day to day, nearer to that tomb, from whence not as before I can emerge.\" \" You have been among the dead?\" said the stranger. \"I have.\" \" I understand you. You seem well lodged here?\" \" I have ever kept my word, and sent to you, telUng you where I am.\" \" You have, truly. I have no shadow of complaint to make against you.

I dare not do so.\" \" And yet are mortal.\" \"Yes,\" repeated Varney, \"yes, and yet am mortal.\" \" It was I that plucked you back to that world, which, to judge from your appear ance, has had since that eventful period but few charms for you. By my faith you look like \" He took from his pocket, as he spoke, a clasped book, from which he produced several bank notes, which he placed before the stranger. \" A thousand pounds,\" he said ; \" that is the agreement.\" \"It is to the very letter.

Indeed I wiU go quite as far as to say, truthfuUy, that did not my necessities require this amount from you, you should have the boon, for which you pay that price, at a much cheaper rate.\" \" Enough ! enough !\" said Varney. \" It is strange, that your face should have been the last I say when the world closed upon me, and the first that met my eyes when I was again snatched back to life ! Do you pursue stiU your dreadful trade?\" \"Yes,\" said the stranger, \"for; year, and then, with such a moderate com petence as fortune has assigned me, I retire, to make way for youuger and abbr spirits. \"Like what I am,\" interrupted Varney. \" This is a subject that once a year gets frightfully renewed between us. For weeks before your visit I am haunted by frightful recollections, and it takes me many weeks after you are gone before I can restore myself to serenity. Look at me; am I not an altered man?\" \" In faith you are,\" said the stranger. \" I have no wish to press upon you painful recoUections. And yet 'tis strange to me that upon such a man as you, the event to which you allude should produce so terri ble an impression.\" \" I have passed through the agony of death,\" said Varney, \"and have again endured the torture \u2014 for it is such \u2014 ofthe re-union of the body and the soul; not having endured so much, not the faintest echo of such feelings can enter into your imagination.\""], [156, "146 VARNEY, THE VAMPVKE; OR. i I \"And then,\" said Varney, \"shall you still require of me such an amount as this?\" Then, when he was alone, that myste rious owner of (hal costly homo drew a long breath of apparently cxquisii.- relief. \"Thatisover ! \u2014 that is irv*-r I\" he said. \" He shall bave the other thousand pounds, perchance, sooner than he thinks.

With what an earnest gaze you still regard me !\" \"I do. It does appear to me most strange, that time should not have ob literated the effects vbich I thought would have ceased with their cause. You are no more the man that in my recollection you once were, than I am like a sporting child.\" \" And I never shall be,\" said Varney ; \" never\u2014 never again ! This self-same look which the hand of death had placed upon me, I shaU ever wear. I shudder at my self, and as I oft perceive the eye of idle curiosity fixed steadfastly upon me, I won der in my inmost heart if even the wildest guesser hits upon the cause why I am not like unto other men?\" Surely it must be guilt of no common die that could oppress a man so destitute of human sympathies as Sir Francis Var- ; ney. The dreadful suspicions that hovered j round him with respect to what he was, appeared to gather confirmationfrom every act of his existence. Whether or not this man, to whom he j felt bound to pay annually so large a sum, was in the secret, and knew him to be something more than earthly, we cannot at present declaie ; but it would seem from the tenor of their conversation as if such were the fact. \" No. Of that you may depend there is no suspicion. ButI wiU leave you now; we part such friends, as men situated as weare can be.

We say this may be so, and yet again some more natural and rational explana tion may unexpectedly present itself ; and there may be yet a dark page iu Sir Francis Varney 's life's volume, which will place him in a light of superadded terrors to our readers. \" Do you leave England, then?\" \" I do. You know my situation in life. It is not one which offers me inducements to remain. In some other land, I shall win the respect and attention I may not hope for here. There my wealth will win many golden opinions; and casting, as best I may, the veil of forgetfulness over my former life, my declining years may yet be happy.

He was evidently intent upon reaching the latter place by the shortest possible route, and in the darkness of that night, for the moon had not yet risen, he showed no slight acquaintance with the intricacies of that locality, that he was at all enabled to pursue so undeviat ingly a tract as that which he took. He muttered frequently to himself low, indistinct words as he went, and chiefly did they seem to have reference to that strange interview he had so recently had with one who, from some combination of circum stances scarcely to be guessed at, evidently exercised a powerful control over him, and was enabled to make a demand upon his pecuniary resources of rather startlingmag nitude. And yet, from a stray word or two, which were pronounced more distinctly, he did not seem to be thinking in anger over that interview ; but it would appear tbat it ra ther had recaUed to his remembrance cir cumstances of a painful and a degrading nature, which time had not been abla entirely to obliterate from his recollection. \" Yes, yes,\" he said, as he paused upon the margin of the wood, to the confines of which he, or what seemed to be he, had once been chased by Marchdale and the Bannerworths \u2014 \"yes, the very sight of that man recalls all the frightful pageantry of a horrible tragedy, which I can never \u2014 never forget. Never can it escape my memory, as a horrible, a terrible fact; but it is the sight of this man alone that can re call all its fearful minuti\u00e6 to my mind, aad paint to my imagination, in the most vivid colours, every, the least particular connected with that time of agony. These periodical visits much affect me. For months I dread them, and for months I am but slowly recovering from the shocks they give me. 'But once more,' he says \u2014 ' but once more,' and then we shall not meet again. Well \u2014 well ; perchance be fore that time arrives, I may be able to possess myself of those resources which will enable me to forestall his visit, and so at least free myself from the pang of ex pecting him.\" He paused at the margin of the wood, and glanced in the direction of Banner worth HaU. By the dim light that yet showed from out the light sky, he could discern the gable-ends, and turret-like windows; he could see the well laid out gardens, and the grove of stately firs that shaded it from the northern blasts, and, as he gazed, a strong emotion seemed to come over him, such as no one could have sup posed would for one moment have poa- CHAPTER XXXIII. TUB STRANGE INTEEVIEW. \u2014 THE OHASE THROUGH THE HALL. T was with the most melan- choly aspect that anything human could weU bear that he, Sir Francis Varney, took his usual and Dightly walk, although per haps in saying so much pro bably we are instituting a comparison which circum stances scarcely empower us to do ; for who shall say that that singular man, around whom a very atmosphere of mys tery seemed to be perpetually increasing, was human? A v.rse as we are to beUeve in the super natural, or even to invest humanity with any preternatural powers, the more than singular facts and circumstances surround ing the existence and tbe acts of that man bung to the mind a kind of shuddering conviction, that if he be indeed really mortal he still must possess some powers beyond ordinary mortality, and be walking the earth for some unhallowed purposes, such as ordinary men, with the ordinary attributes of human nature, can scarcely guess at. SUently and alone he took his way through tbat beautiful tract of country, comprehending such picturesque charms of"], [158, "148 VARNEY, TIIE VAMPYRE ; OR, sessed the frame of one so apparently unconnected with aU human sympathies. \u2022' i know this spot well,\" he said, \"and my appearance here on that eventful occa sion, when the dread of my approach in duced a crime only second to murder itself, was on such a night as this, when all was so still and calm around, and when he who, at the merest shadow of my presence, rather chose to rush on death than be as sured it was myself. Curses on the cir cumstances that so soiled me ! I should have been most wealthy. I should have possessed tbe means of commanding the adulation of those who now hold me but cheaply ; but stUl the time may come. I have a hope yet, and that greatness which I have ever panted for, tbat magician-like power over my kind, which the possession of ample means alone, can give, may yet be mine.\" and T will have it; and then, if with my own hands I displace it brick by brick un\u00abl stone by stone, 1 wUl discover that hidden secret which no one but myself now dreams of. It shall be done by force or fraud, by love or by despair, I care not which ; tho end shall sanctify all means. Ay, even if I wade through blood to my desire, I say it shall be done.\" There was a holy and a stUl calmness about the night, much at variance with the storm of angry passion that appeared to be momentarily gathering power in the breast of that fearful man. Not the least sound came from Bannerworth Hall, and it was only occasionally that from afar off on tho night air there came the bark of some watch-dog, or the low of distant cattle. All else was mute, save when the deep, sepulchral tone of that man, if man he was, gave an impulse to the soft air aronnd him. Wrapping his cloak more closely around him, he strode forward with that long, noiseless step which was peculiar to him. Mechanically he appeared to avoid those obstacles o! hedge and ditch whicb im peded his pathway. Surely be had come that road often, or he would not so easily have pursued his way. And now he stood by the edge of a plantation which in some measure protected from trespassers the more private gardens of the Hall, and there he paused, as if a seeling of irresolu tion had coma over him, or it might be, as, indeed, it seemed, from his subsequent conduct, that lie had come without any fixed intention, or if with a fixed intention, without any regular plan of carrying it into ellect With a stroUing movement, as if he were careless if he proceeded in that direction or not, he still went onward towards the house, and now he stood by that little summer-house once so sweet and so dear a retreat, in which the heart-etricken Flora had held her interview with him whom she loved with a devotion nnknown to meaner minds. This spot scarcely commanded any view of the house, for so enclosed was it among evergreens and blooming flowers, that it seemed Uke a very wiiderness of nature, upon which, with liberal hand, she had showered down in wild luxuriance her wildest floral beauties. In and around that spot the night air was loaded with sweets. The mingled perfume of many flowers made that place seem a very paradise. But ob, how sadly at variance with that beauty and contented ness of nature was he who stood amidst such beauty ! All incapable as he was of appreciating its tenderness, or of gathering ! i the faintest moral from its glory. \"Why am I here?\" he said. \"Here, ji without fixed design or stability of purpose, j I like some miser who has hidden his own hoards so deeply within the bowels of the | earth he cannot hope that he shall ever again be able to bring them to the light of day. I hover around this spot which I feel \u2014 which I know contains my treasure, though I cannot lay my hand s upon it, or exult in its gUstening beauty.\" Even as he spoke he cowered down like \\ some guilty thing, for he heard a faint foot-step upon the garden path. So light so fragile was the step, tha* , in the light of day, the very hum of summer insects would have drowned the noise; but he heard it, Did he again dream of intruding into any of tbe chambers of that mansion, with the ghastly aspect of that terrible creation with which, in the minds of its inhabitants, he seemed to be but too closely identified? He was pale, attenuated, and trembled. Could it be that so soon it had become necessary to renew the life-blood in his veins in the awful manner which it is sup posed the vampyre brood are compelled to protract their miserable existence? It might be so, and that he was even now reflecting upon how once more he could kindle the fire of madness in' the brain of that beautiful girl, whom he had already made so irretrievably wretched. He leant against an aged tree, and his strange, lustrous-looking eyes seemed to collect every wandering scintiUation of light that was around, and to shine with preternatural intensity. \u2022' I must, I will,\" he said, \"be master of Bannerworth Hall. It must come to that. I have set an existence' upon its possession,"], [159, "THE FEAST OF BLOOD. 149 1 1 that man of crime \u2014 of unholy and awful 'mpulses. He heard it, and he shrunk down among the shrubs and flowers tiU he \\ was hidden completely from observation I amid a world of fragrant essences. Was it some one stealthily in that place, even as he was, unwelcome or unknown? or was it one wbo had observed him in- trude upon the privacy of those now un- happy precincts, and who was coming to 1 deal upon him that death which, vampyre though he might be, he was yet suscepti- ble of from mortal hands? The footstep advanced, and lower down he shrunk until his coward-heart beat . against the very earth itself. He knew that he was unarmed, a circumstance rare [ with him, and only to be accounted for by the disturbance of his mind consequence upon the visit of the strange man to his house, whose presence had awakened so ' many conflicting emotions. Nearer and nearer still came that light footstep, and his deep-seated fears would not let him perceive that it was not the step of caution or of treachery, but owed its lightness to the natural grace and freedom of movement of its owner. The moon must have arisen, although obscured by clouds, through which it cast but a dim radiance, for the night had cer- tainly grown lighter ; so that, although there were no strong shadows cast, a more diffused brightness was about all things, and their outUnes looked not so dancing, and confused tie one with the other. He strained his eyes in the direction whence the sounds proceeded, and then his fears for his personal safety vanished, for he saw it was a female form that was slowly advancing towards him. I His first impulse was to rise, for with the transient glimpse he got of it, he knew that it must be Flora Bannerworth ; but a second thought, probably one of intense curiosity to know what could possibly have brought her to such a spot at such a time, restrained him and he was quiet. But if the surprise of Sir Frincis Varney was great to see Flora Bannerworth at such a time in such a place, we have no doubt, that with the knowledge which our readers havu of her, their astonishment would more thau fully equal his; and when we come to consider, that since that eventful period when the sanctity of her chamber bad been so violated by the fearful midnight visitant, it must appear somewhat strange that she could gather courage sufficient to wander forth alone at sucb an hour. come across her mind with a shuddering consciousness of its probability? Had sbe no reflection that each step she took was taking her further and further from those who would aid her in all extremities? It would seem not, for she walked onward, unheeding, and apparently unthinking of the presence, possible or probable, of that bane of her existence. But let us look at her again. How strange and spectral-like she moves along ; there seems no speculation in her counte nance, but with a strange and gliding step, she walks like some dim shadow of the past in that ancient garden. She is very pale, and on her brow there is the stamp of suffering ; her dress is a morning robe, she holds it tightly round her, and thus she moves forward towards that summer house which probably to her was sanctified by having witnessed those vows of pure affection, which came from the lips of Charles Holland, about whose fate there now hung so great a mystery. Has madness really seized upon the brain of that beautiful girl? Has the strong in teUect really sunk beneath the oppressions to which it has been subjected ? Does she now walk forth with a disordered intellect, the queen of some fantastic realm, viewing the material world with eyes that are not of earth; shunning perhaps that which she should have sought, and, perchance, in her frenzy, seeking that which in a happier frame of mind she would have shunned? Such might have been'the impression of any one who had looked upon her for a moment, and who knew the disastrous scenes through which she had so recently passed ; but we can spare our readers the pangs of such a supposition. We have bespoken their love for Flora Bannerworth, and we are certain that she has it ; there fore would we spare them, even for a few brief moments, from imagining that cruel destiny had done its worst, and that the pure and beautiful 6pirit we have so much commended had lost its power of rational reflection. No ; thank Heaven, such is not the case. Flora Bannerworth is not mad, but under the strong influence of some eccentric dream, which has pictured to her mind images which have no home but in the airy realmsof imagination, she has wandered forth from her chamber to that sacred spot where she harl met him she loved, and heard the noblest declaration of truth and constancy that ever flowed from human lips. Yes, she is sleeping; but, witha precision such as the somnambulist so strangely exerts, she trod . the well known paths slowly, but surely, towards that summer- Had she no dread of meeting that un earthly being?

He who stood between her and her heart's best joy ; he who had destroyed all hope of happiness, and who had converted her dearest affections into only so many causes of greater disquietude than the blessings they should have been to her. Oh ! could she have imagined but for one \u25a0moment that he was there, with what an eagerness ot terror would she have flown back again to the shelter of those walls, where at least was to be found some pro tection from the fearful vampyre's embrace, and where she would be within bail of friendly hearts, who would stand boldly Ibetween her and every thought of harm. But she knew it not, and onwards she went until the very hem of her garment touched the faee of Sir Francis Varney. And he was terrified \u2014 he dared not move \u2014 he dared not speak! The idea that she had died, and that this was her spirit, come to wreak some terrible vengeance upon him, for a time possessed him, and so paralysed with fear was ne, tbat he could neither move nor speak. But she was in no state to see so tertible a sight Her hands were over her face, and she was weeping still. \" Surely, he loves me,\" sho whispered ; \" he has said he loves me, and he does not speak in vain.

The very repetition of the name of Charles Holland seemed to be galling to Sir Francis Varney. He made a gesture of impatience, as she again uttered it, and then stepping forward, he stood within a pace of \"where she sat, and in a fearfully distinct voice, he said \u2014 \" Flora Bannerworth, awake ! awake ! and look upon me, although the sight blast you, and drive you to despair. Awake \u2014 awake!\" It was not the sound of the voice which aroused her from that strange slumber. It is said that those who sleep in that eccentric manner, are insensible to sounds, but that the slightest touch will arouse them in au instant; and so it was in this case, for Sir Francis Varney, as he spoke, laid upon the hand of Flora two of his cold, corpse-like looking signers. A shriek burst from her lips, and although the confusion of her memory and conceptions was immense, yet she was awake, aud tho somnambulistic trance had left her. \" Help \u2014 help !\" she cried. \" Gracious Heavens ! Where am I?\" Varney spoke not, but he spread out his long, thin arms in such a manner, that he seemed almost to encircle her, while he touched her not, so that escape became a matter of impossibility, and to attempt to do so must have been to have thrown her self into his hideous embrace. She could obtain but a single view of the face and figure of him who opposed her progress, but slight as that view was, it more than sufficed. The very extremity of fear came across her, and she sat like one paralysed; the only evidence of existence she gave, consisted in the words \u2014 \"The vampyre \u2014 the vampyre !\" \" Yes,' said Varney, \" the vampyre.

Now, foul being, blot upon the earth's surface, horrible imitation of humanity, if mortal arm can do aught against you, you shall die!\" It was nearly morning, so that the fields"], [166, "156 VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE ; OR, were brightening np with the faint radi ance of the coming day; and when Henry reached a point which he knew com manded an extensive view, he paused, and ran his eye eagerly along the land scape, with a hope of discovering some trace of the fugitive. Sucb, however, was not the case ; he saw nothing, heard nothing of Sir Francis Varney; and then he turned, and caUed loudly to George to join him, and was immediately replied to by his brother's presence, accompanied by Marchdale. Before, however, they codld exchange a word, a rattling discharge of fire-arms took place from one of the windows, and they heard the admiral, in a loud voice, shouting\u2014 \" Brradside to broadside! Give it them attain, Jack! Hi: them between wind and water !\" The distance was not great, and they soon reached the margin of the wood ; they then separated, agreeing to meet within it, at a well-spring, familiar to them all; previous to which each was to make his best endeavour to discover if any one was hidden among the bush-wood or in the hollows of the ancient trees they should encounter on their line of march. The fact was, that Henry, finding that he was likely to pass an exceedingly dis turbed, restless night, through agitation of spirits, had, after tossing to and fro on his couch for many hours, wisely at length risen, and determined to walk abroad in the gardens belonging to the mansion, in preference to continuing in such a state of fever and anxiety, as be was in, in his own chamber. Since the vampyres dreadful visit, it had been the custom of both the brothers, occasionally, to tap at the chamber door of Flora, who, at her own request, now that she had changed her room, and dispensed with any one sitting up with her, wished occ\u00e6ionaUy to be communicated with by some member of the famUy. Henry, then, after rapidly dressing, as he passed the door of her bedroom, was about to tap at it, when to his surprise he found it open, and upon hastUy entering it he observed that the bed was empty, and a hasty glance round the apartment con vinced him that Flora was not there. Then there was another rattling dis charge, and Henry exclaimed\u2014 \" What is the meaning of that firing?\" \" It come's from the admiral's room,\" said Marchdale. \" On my life, I think the old man must be mad. He has some six or eight pistols ranged in a row along the window-sill, and all loaded, so that by the aid ofa match they can be pretty well discharged as a volley, which he considers the only proper means of firing upon the vampyre.\" \"It is so,\" replied George; \"and, no doubt, hearing an alarm, he has com menced operations by firing into the enemy.\" \"Well, well,\" said Henry; \"he must have his way. I have pursued Varney thus far, and that he has again retreated to the wood, I cannot doubt. Between this and the full light of day, let us at least make an effort to discover his place of retreat. We know the locality as well as he can possibly, and I propose now that we commence au active search.\" Alarm took possession ofhim, and hastily arming himself, he roused Marchdale and and George, but without waiting for them to be ready to accompany him, he sought the garden, to search it thoroughly in case she should be anywhere there concealed. Thus it was he had come npon the con ference so strangely and so unexpectedly held between Varney and Flora in the summer-house. With what occurred upon that discovery our readers are acquainted. \" Come on, then,\" said Marchdale. \" We are all armed; and I, for one, shall feel no hesitation in taking the life, if it be possible to do so, of that strange being.\" \" Of that possibility you doubt?\" said George, as they hurried on across the meadows. Flora had promised George that she would return immediately to the house, but when in compliance with the caU of Henry, George and Marchdale had left her alone, she felt so agitated and faint that she began to cUng to the trellis-work of the little building for a few moments before she could gather strength to reach the mansion. \" Indeed I do, and with reason too. I'm certain that when I fired at him before I hit him; and, besides, Flora must have shot him upon the occasion when we were absent, and she used your pistols, Henry, to defend herself and her mother.\" Two or three minutes might thus have elapsed, and Flora was in such a state of mental bewilderment with all that had occurred, that she could scarce believe it real, when suddenly a slight sound at tracted her attention, and through the gap \" It would seem so,\" said Henry; \" and disre-.'arding all present circumstances, if I do meet him, I will put to the proof whe- (\"which had been made in the wall of the ther he be mortal or not.\" J summer-house, with au appearance of summer-house, with an appearance of"], [167, "THE FEAST OF BLOOD. 157 perfect composure, again appeared Sir Francis Varney. \" Flora,\" he said, quietly resuming the discourse which had been broken off, \" I am quite convinced now that you will be much the happier for the interview.\" \"Gracious Heaven !\"saidFlora, \"whence have you come from?\" \"I have never left,\" said Varney. \" But I saw you fly from this spot.\" \"You did; but it was only to another immediately outside the summer-house. I had no idea of breaking off our confer ence so abruptly.\" \u25a0 , \" Have you anything to add to what you have already stated?\" \" Absolutely nothing, unless you have a question to propose to me \u2014 I should have thought you had, Flora. Is there no other circumstance weighing heavily upon your mind, as well as the dreadful visitation I have subjected you to?\" \" Yes,\" said Flora. \" What has be come of Charles HoUand?\" all that delightful sensation which the mind experiences when it is skaking off the trammels of some serious evil which it delights now to find that the imagination has attired in far worse colours than the facts deserved. It is scarcely necessary, after this, to say that the search in the wood for Sir Francis Varney was an unproductive one, and that the morning dawned upon the labours of the brothers and of Mr. March dale, without their having discovered the least indication ofthe presence of Varney. Again puzzled and confounded, they stood on the margin of the wood, and looked sadly towards the brightening windows of Bannerworth Hall, which were now reflect ing with a golden radiance the slant rays of the morning sun. \"Foiled again,\" remarked Henry, with a gesture of impatience ; \" foiled again, and as completely as before. I declare that I wUl fight this man, let our friend the admi ral say what he will against such a measure. I will meet him in mortal combat ; he shall consummate his triumph over our whole family by my death, or I will rid the world and ourselves of so frightful a character.\" \"Let us hope,\" said Marchdale, \" that some other course may be adopted, which shaU put an end to these proceedings.\" \" That,\" exclaimed Henry, \" is to hope against all probability ; what other course can be pursued? Be this Varney man or devU, he has evidently marked us for his prey.\" \" Indeed, it would seem so,\" remarked George; \" but yet he shall find that we will not fall so easUy ; he shall discover that if poor Flora's gentle spirit has been crushed by these frightful circumstances, we are of a sterner mould.\" \" He shaU,\" said Henry; \"I for one wiU dedicate my life to this matter.

He or I must faU.\" \" Well spoken,\" said Marchdale ; \" and yet I hope that circumstances may occur to prevent such a necessity of action, and that probably you wiU yet see that it wUl be wise and prudent to adopt a milder and a safer course.\" 'Listen. Do not discard all hope; when you are from here you will meet with him again.\" \" But he has left me.\" \" And yet he wUl be able, when you again encounter him, so far to extenuate hjs seeming perfidy, that you shaU hold him as untouched in honour as when first he whispered to you that he loved you.\" \"Oh, joy! joy!\" said Flora; \"by that assurance you have robbed misfortune of its sting, and richly compensated me for aU that I have suffered.\" \" Adieu!\" said the vampyre. \" I shall now proceed to my own home by a differ ent route to that taken by those who would kill me.\" \" But after this,\" said Flora, \" there shall be no danger; you shall be held harmless, and our departure from Banner- worth Hall shall be so quick, that you will soon be released from all apprehension of vengeance from my brother, and I shall taste again of that happiness which I thought had fled from me for ever.\" \"FareweU,\" said the vampyre; and folding his cloak closely around him, he strode from the summer-house, soon dis- appearing from her sight behind the shrubs aad ample vegetation with which that garden abounded. Flora sunk upon her knees, and uttered a brief, but heartfelt thanksgiving to Heaven for this happy change in her des- tiny. The hue of health faintly again visited her cheeks, and as she now, with a feeUng of more energy and strength than she had been capable of exerting for many days, walked towards the house, she felt \" No, Marchdale, you cannot feel as we leel. You look on more as a spectator, sympathising with the afflictions of either, than feelingthe full sting of those afflictions yourself.\" \" Do I not feel acutely for you? I'm a lonely man in the world, and I have taught"], [168, "VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE. 158 of consideration, which could not be too soon bestowed. myself now to centre my affections in your family ; my recollections of carly years assist me iu so doing. Believe me, both of you, that I am no idle spectator of your griefs, but that I share them fully. If I advise you to be peaceful, and to endea vour by the gentlest means possible to accomplish your aims, it is not that I would counsel you cowardice : but having seen so much more of the world than either of you have had timeor opportunity of seeing, I do not look so enthusiastically upon matters, but, with a cooler, calmer judg ment, I do not say better, I proffer to you my counsel.\" \" We thank you,\" said Henry; \" but this is a matter in which action seems specially called for. It is not to be borne that a whole family is to be oppressed by such a fiend in human shape as that Varney.\" 'Let me,\" said Marchdale, \"counsel you to submit to Flora's decision in this business ; let her wishe3 constitute the rules of action. Sbe is the greatest suf ferer, and the one most deeply interested in the termination of this fearful business. Moreover, she has judgment aud decision of character; she will advise you rightly, be assured.\" By a combination of disagreeables, everything tbat could possibly occur to disturb tbe peace of the family seemed to have taken place at once ; like Macbeth's, their troubles had truly come in battalions, and now that the serenity of tiieir domestic position was destroyed, minor evils and annoyances which that very serenity had enabled them to hold at arm's-length became gigantic, and added much to their distress. The small income, which, when all was happiness, health and peace, was made to constitute a comfortable household, was now totally inadequate to do so\u2014 the power to economise and to make tho most of a little, had flown along with that contented ness of spirit which thc harmony of circum stances alone could produce. It was not to be supposed that poor Mrs. Bannerworth could now, as she had for merly done, when her mind wa9 free from anxiety, attend to those domestic matters which make up the comforts of a famUy \u2014 distracted at the situation of her daughter, and bewUdered by the rapid succession of troublesome events which so short a period of time had given birth to, she fell into an inert state of mind as different as any thing could possibly be from her former active existence. \" That she would advise us honourably,\" said Henry, \" and that we should feel every disposition in tbe world to defer to her wishes out proposition, is not tobe doubted; but little shall be done without her counsel and sanction. Let us now proceed home ward, for I am most anxious to ascertain bow it came about tbat sbe and Sir Francis Varney were together in that summer-house at so strange an hour.\" They all three walked together towards tbe house, conversing in a similar strain as they went. It has likewise been seen how the very domestics fled from Bannerworth HaU iu dismay, rather than remain beneath the same roof with a family believed to be subject to the visitations of so awful a being as a vampyre. Among the class who occupy positions of servitude, certainly there might have been found some, who, with feUings and understandings above such considerations, would have clung sympathetically to that family in distress, which they had known under a happier aspect ; but it bad not been the good fortune of the Bannerworths to have such as these about them; hence selfishness had its way, and they were de serted. It was not Ukely, then, that stran gers would wiUingly accept service in a family so situated, without some powerful impulse in the shape of a higher pecuniary consideration, as was completely ont of the power of the Bannerworths to offer. Thus was it, then, that most cruelly, at the very time that they had most need of assistance and of sympathy, this unfortu nate famUy almost became isolated from their kind; and, apart from every other consideration, it would have been almost impossible for them to continue inhabitants CHAPTER XXXVL THE CONSULTATION. \u2014 THE DUBL AND ITS RESULTS. NDEPENDENTOt this interview which Flora bad had with the much- dreaded Sir Francis Var- ney, the cir- cumstances in i which she and all who were dear to her happened at that moment \u2022 be placed, certainly required an amount"], [169, "VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE ; OR, THE FEAST OF BLOOD. 161 FLORA'S AGONY ON THE DISAPPEARANCE OF CHARLES HOLLAND. ofthe Hall, with anything !ikc comfort or advantage. i And then, although the disappearance of Charles Holland no longer awakened those feelings of indignation at his supposed per- fidy which were first produced by that event ; still, view it in which way they might, it was a severe blow ot fate, and after it, they one and all found themselves .still less able to contend against the sea of troubles that surrounded them. The reader, too, will not have failed to remark tbat there was about the whole of the family that pride of independence which induced them to shrink from living upon extraneous aid; and hence, although they fel', and felt truly, that when Adtoiral Be 1, in his frank manner, offered them pecuniary assistance, that it was no idle compliment, yet with a sensitiveness such as they might be well expected to feel, they held back, and asked each other what prospec* there was of emerging from such a state of things, and if it were justifiable to commence a life of depenriance, the end of which was not evident or tangible. Notwithstanding, too, the noble confi dence of Flora in her lover, and notwith standing that confidence had been echoed by her brothers, there would, at times, ob trude into the minds of the latter, feeling of the possibiUty that, after all, they might No. 21."], [170, "160 VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE ; OR, be mistaken ; and Charles Holland might, fiom some sudden impulse, fancying his future happiness was all at stake, have withdrawn himself from the Hall, and really written the letters attributed to him. Such a feeUng as this was, of course, a source of deep consolation; and with a firmer voice, and more of her old spirit of cheerfulness about her than she had lately exhibited, she egain detailed the particu lars of the interview to all who had assem bled, concluding by saying \u2014 We say this only obtruded itself occa sionally, for all their real feelings and as pirations were the other way, although Mr. Marchdale, they could perceive, had his doubts, and they could not but confess that he was more likely to view the matter calmly and dispassionately than they. In fact 'be very hesitation with which he spoke upon the subject, convinced them of his doubts, for they attributed that hesi tation to a fear of giving them pain, or of wounding the prejudices of Admiral Bell, with whom he had already had words so nearly approaching to a quarrel. Henry's visit to Mr. Chillingworth was not likely to be productive of any results beyond those of a conjectural character. All that that gentleman could do was to express a willingness to be directed by them in any way, rather than suggest any course of conduct himself upon circum stances which he could not be expected to judge of as they who were on the spot, and had witnessed their actual occurrence. \" And this has given me hope of happier days. If it be a delusion, it is a happy one; and now bnt that a frightful veil of mystery still hangs over the fate of Charles HoUand, how gladly would I bid adieu to this place, and aU that has mado it terrible. I could almost pity Sir Francis Varney, rather than condemn him.\" \"That maybe true,\" said Henry, \"to a certain extent, sister; but we never can forget the amount of misery he has brought upon ns. It is no slight thing to be forced from our old and much loved home, even if such proceeding does succeed in freeing us from his persecutions.\" \" But, my young friend,\" said March dale, \" you must recollect, that through life it is continually the lot of humanity to be endeavouring to fly from great evils to those which do not prosent themselves to the mind in so bad an aspect. It is some thing, surely, to alleviate affliction, if we cannot entirely remove it.\" \" That is true,\" said Mr. Chillingworth, \" to a considerable extent, but then it takes too much for granted to please me.\" \"How so, sir?\" \" Why, certainly, to remove from Ban nerworth Hall is a much less evil than to remain at Bannerworth Hall, and bo haunted by a vampyre; but then that pro position takes for granted that vampyre business, which I will never grant. I re peat, again and again, it is contrary to all experience, to philosophy, and to aU tho laws of ordinary nature.\" \" Facts are stubborn things,\" said Marchdale. And now we will suppose that the reader is enabled with us to look into one of the principal rooms of Bannerworth Hall. It is evening, and some candles are shed ding a sickly light on the ample propor tions of the once handsome apartment. At solemn consultation the whole of the famUy are assembled. As well as the admiral, Mr. Chillingworth, and Marchdale, Jack Pringle, too, walked in, by the sufferance of his master, as if he considered he had a perfect right to do so. The occasion of the meeting had been a communication which Flora had made con cerning her most singular and deeply in teresting interview with the vampyre. The details of this interview had produced a deep effect upon the whole of the family. Flora was there, and she looked better, calmer, and more collected than she had done for some days past. No doubt the interview she had had with Varney in the summer-house in the garden had dispeUed a host of imaginary terrors with which she had surrounded him, al though it had confirmed her fully that he and he only was the dreadful being who had caused her so much misery. That interview had tended to show her that about him there was yet something human, and that there was not a danger of her being hunted down from place to place by so horrible an existence. \" Apparently,\" remarked Mr. ChilUng worth. \"WeU, sir; and here we have the fact of a vampyre.\" \"The presumed fact. One swallow don't make a summer, Mr. Marchdale.\" \" This is waste of time,\" said Henry\u2014 \" of course, the amount of evidence that will suffice to bring conviction to one man's mind will fail in doing so to another. The question is, what are we to do?\" AU eyes were turned upon Flora, as if this question was more particularly ad dressed to her, and it behoved her, above all others, to answer it. She did so; and in a firm, clear voice, she said \u2014 \" I will discover the fate of Charbw HoUand, and then leave the Hall.\""], [171, "THE FEAST OF BLOOD. 161 \"The fate of Charles Holland I\" said Marchdale. \" Why, really, unless that young gentleman chooses to be communi cative bimself upon so interesting a subject, we may be a long while discovering his fa'.c. 1 know that it is not a romantic view to take of the question, to suppose simply that Ire wrote thc three letters found upon his dressing-table and then decamped; but to my mind, it savours most wonderfully of matter-' f-fact. I now speak more freely than I have otherwise done, for I am now upon the eve of my departure. I have no to remain here and breed dissension in any family, or to run a tilt against any body's prejudices.\" Here he looked at Admiral Bell. \" I leave this house to night.\" the moment Flora stepped forward, and in a clear voice, she said \u2014 \"No, let bim go, he doubts Charles Holland ; let aU go who doubt Charles Holland. Mr. Marchdale, Heaven forgive you this injustice you are doing. We may never meet again. FareweU, sir !\" These words were spoken in so decided a tone, that no one contradicted them. Marchdale cast a strange kind of look round upon the family circle, and in ano ther instant he was gone. \" Huzza !'' shouted Jack Pringle ; \" that's one good job.\" Henry looked rather resentful, which the admiral could not bnt observe, and so, less with the devil-may-care manner in which he usuaUy spoke, tbe old man ad dressed bim. \" You're a d\u2014 d lubberly thief,\" said the r admiral; \"the sooner you leave it thc better.

I do much regret that you have quarreUed with Mr. Marchdale ; bat what is done can't be undone.\" \"Do not leave us,\" said Flora; \"let me beg of you, A dmiral BeU, not to leave us ; for my sake remain here, for to you I can speakfreely and with confidenceof Charles, when probably I can do so to no one else. You know him well and have a confidence in him which no one elso can aspire to. I pray you, thereforo, to stay with us.\" \" Only on one condition,\" said the admiral. ' ' >h, never mind,\" said Marchdale; \"I look upon this old nautical rullian as some between a fool and a madman. If he were a younger man I should chastise him upon tho spot; but as it is I live in hopes of yet getting him into some com lortable lunatic asylum.\" \"Me into an asylum !\" shouted the ad miral. -Jack, did you hear that?\" \" Ay, ay, sir.\" '* Farewell, all of you,\" said Marchdale; \" my best wishes be with this family. I cannot remain under this roof to be so insulted.\" \"Name it\u2014 name it !\" \" You think of letting the HaU?\" \" Yes, yes.\" \".Let me have it, then, and let me pay a few years in advance. If you don't, I'm d \u2014 d if I stay another night in the place. You must give me immediate possession, too, and stay here as my guests until you suit yourselves elsewhere. Those are my terms and conditions. Say yes, and all's right ; say no, and I'm off Uke a round shot from a carronade. D e, that's the thing, Jack, isn't it?\" \"A good riddance,\" cried the admiral. \" I'd rather sail round the world with a \"I of vampyres than with such a humbugging son of a gun as you are. 1) c, you're worse than a lawyer.\" \" Xay, nay,\" cried Henry, \" Mr. March- tay.\" \"Stay, itay,\" <*ried George, and Mrs. Banuorwortli, likewise, said stay ; but at \u2022\u2022 Ay, ay, sir.\" There was a silence of some few mo ments aster this extraordinary offer had"], [172, "VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE; OR, 162 been made, and then Henry spoke, say ing\u2014 them better than the calm and serious doubting of Marchdale. His ruse of hiring the house of them, and paying the rent in advance, for the purpose of placing ample funds in their hands for any contingency, was not the less amiable because it was so easily seen through; and they could not make up their minds to hurt the feeling of the old nan by the rejection of his generous offer. When he had left, this subject was can vassed among them, and it was agreed that he should have bis own way in the matter for the present, although they hoped to hear something from Marchdale, which should make his departure appear less abrupt and uncomfortable to the whole of the family. Daring the course of this conversation, it was made known to Flora with more distinctness than under any other circum stances it would have been, that George Holland had been on the eve of fighting a duel with Sir Francis Varney, previous to his mysterious disappearance. When she became fully aware of this fact, to her mind it seemed materially to add to tho suspicions previously to then entertained, that foul means had been used in order to pui Charles out of the way. \" Who knows,\" sho said, \" that this Varney may not shrink with the greatest terror from a conflict with nny human being, and feeling one was inevitable with Charles Holland, unless interrupted by some vigorous act of his own, he or some myrmidons of his may have taken Charles's Use !\" \" Admiral Bell, your generous offer, and the feelings which dictated it, are by far too transparent for us to affect not to un derstand them.

Come along.\" \"Ay, ay, sir.\" And off went the admiral and Jack, after leaving a twenty pound note in Mrs. Banner worth's lap. CHAPTER XXXVII.

But fear not ; he wiU find, if he has really committed any such atrocity, that it will not save him.\" These words of Henry, though they made no impression at the time upon Flora, be yond what they carried upon their surface, really, however, as concerned Henry himself, implied a settled resolution, which he immediately set about reducing to practice. by his gene rosity and evi dent single mindedness of his behaviour, that although not one, ex- his conduct towards Mr. Marchdale, yet they could not help liking him ; and had they been placed in a position to choose which of the two they would have had re main with them, the admiral or Marchdale, there can be no question they would have made choice of the former. When the conference broke up, night as it stiU was, he, without saying anything to any one, took his hat and cloak, and lelt the HaU, proceeding by the nearest practi cable route to the residence of Sir Francis Varney, where he arrived without any in terruption of any character. Varney was at first denied to him, but before he could leave the house, a servant came down the great staircase, to say it was a mistake ; and that Sir Francis was at home, and would be happy to see him. StiU, however, it was not pleasant to find a man iike Marchdale virtually driven from the honse, because he presumed to differ in opinion upon a very doubtful matter with another of its inmates. But as it was the nature of the Bannerworth famUy always to incline to the most generous view of subjects, the frank, hearty confidence of the old admiral in Charles Holland pleased"], [173, "THE FEAST OF BLOOD. 163 He was ushered into the same apartment where Sir Francis Varney had before re ceived his visitors ; and there sat tho now declared vampyre, looking pale and ghastly by the dim light which burned in the apart ment, and, indeed, more like some spectre of the tomb, than one of the great family of man. no good or generous object my young sir, could be so obtained \u2014 you acknowledge so much, I doubt not?

I have come to exact an account of how you have disposed of my friend; and I will have it.\" \" Be seated, sir,\" said Varney ; ' ' although my eyeshave seldom the pleasureof behold ing you within these walls, be assured you are an honoured guest\" \" Sir Francis Varney,\" said Henry, \" I came not here to bandy compliments with you ; I have none to pay to yon, nor do I wish to hear any of them from your lips.\" \" An excellent sentiment, young man,\" said Varney, \" and well delivered.

Know you anything of my friend, Mr. Charles Hol land?\" said Henry, in marked accents ; and he gazed on Sir Francis Varney with an earnestness that seemed to say not even a look should escape his observation. Varney, however, returned the gaze as steadily, but coldly, as he repUed in his measured accents \u2014 \" Gently, may good sir; you are aware I know nothing of your friend ; his motions are his own ; and as to what I have done with him, my only answer is, that he would permit me to do nothing with him, had I been so inclined to have taken the liberty.\" \" You are suspected, Sir Francis Varney' of having made an attempt upon the life or liberty of Charles HoUand; you, in fact, are suspected of being his murderer \u2014 and, so help me Heaven ! if I have not justice, I will have vengeance!\" \" Young sir, your words are of grave import, and ought to be coolly considered before they are uttered. With regard to justice and vengeance, Mr. Bannerworth, you may have both; but I teU you, of Charles Halland, or what has become of him, I know nothing. But wherefore do you come to so unlikely a quarter to learn something of an individual of whom I know nothing?\" \" Because Charles Holland was to havs fought a duel with you: but before that had time to take place, he has suddenly become missing. I suspect that you are the author of his disappearance, because you fear an encounter with a mortal man.\" \" Mr. Bannerworth, permit me to say in my own defence, that I do not tear any man, however foolish he may be; and wisdom is not an attribute I find, from ex perience in all men, of your friend. How ever, you must be dreamiog, sir \u2014 a kind of vivid insanity has taken possession of your mind, which distorts \" \" Sir Francis Varney !\" exclaimed Henry, now perfectly uncontrollable. \" Sir,\" said Varney, as he filled up the pause, \" proceed; I am all attention. You do me honour.\" \" I have heard of the young gentleman.\" \" And seen him?\" \" And seen him too, as you, Mr. Banner worth, must be well aware. Surely you have not come all this way, merely to make such an inquiry. But, sir, you are welcome to the answer.\" Henry had something of a struggle to keep down the rising anger, at these cool taunts of Varney; but he succeeded\u2014 and then he said \u2014 \"I suspect Charles Holland, Sir Francis Varney, has met with unfair treatment, and that he has been unfairly dealt with, for an unworthy purpose.\" \" Undoubtedly,\" said Varney, \" if the gentleman you allude to has been unfairly dealt witb, it was for a soul purpose ; for \" If,\" resumed Henry, \" such was your object in putting Mr. HoUand aside, by becoming personally or by proxy au"], [174, "VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE; OR, 164 assassio, you are mistaken in supposing you have accompUshed your object.'' \" Go on, sir,\" said Sir Francis Vamey, iu a bland and sweet tone; \"I am all at tention; pray proceed.\" \" You have failed ; for I now here, on this spot, defy you to mortal combat. Coward, assassin as you are, I challenge you to sight.\" \" You don't mean on the carpet here?' said Varney, deliberately. \"No, sir; but beneath the canopy of heaven, in the light ofthe day. And then, Sir Francis, we shall see wbo wUl shrink from the conflict.\" Francis Varney ; we shall see each other again.\" \" I may not detain you, I presume, to taste aught in the way of refreshment?\" Henry made no reply, but turned to wards the door, without even making an attempt to return the grave and formal bow that Sir Francis Varney made as he saw him about to quit the apartment ; for Henry saw that his pale features were lighted up with a sarcastic smile, most disagreeable to look upon as weU as irri tating to Henry Bannerworth. He now quitted Sir Francis Varney 'a abode, being let out by a servant who had been rung for for that purpose by his master. \" It is remarkably good, Mr. Banner worth, and, begging your pardon, for I do not wish to give any offence, my honoured sir, it would rehearse before an audience; in short, sir, it is highly dramatic.\" \" You shrink from the combat, do you? Now, indeed, I know you.\" \"Young man \u2014 young man,\" said Sir Francis, calmly, and shaking his head very deliberately, and the shadows passed across his pale lace, \" you know me not, if vou think Sir Francis Varney shrinks from Lmrself.\" Henry walked homeward, satisfied that he had now done all that he could under the circumstances. \"I wUl send Chillingworth to him in the morning, and then IshaU see what all this will end in. He must meet me, and then Charles HoUand, if not discovered, shall be, at least, revenged.\" There was another person in Banner worth HaU who had formed a similar re solution.

Now, d \u2014 n my carcass from head to stern if I don't call you out !\" \"Well, Admiral Bell,\" said Varney, mildly, \" in that case, I suppose, I must come out. But why do you insist that I have any knowledge of your nephew, Mr. Charles Holland?\" he gave the bell what he called a long puU, a strong puU, and a pull altogether, that set it ringing with a fury, the like of which had never certainly been heard by the household. A minute or two scarcely elapsed before the domestics hurried to answer so urgent a summons; and when the gate was opened, the servant who answered it inquired his business. \" What's that to you, snob? Is yonr master, Sir Francis Varney, in? because, if he be, let him know eld Admiral BeU wants to speak to him. D'ye hear?\" \" Yes, sir,\" repUed the servant, who had pauBed a few moments to examine the in dividual who gave this odd kind of address. In another minute word was brought to him that Sir Francis Varney would be very happy to see Admiral BeU. \"Ay, ay,\" he muttered; \"just as the devil likes to meet with holy water, or as I like any water save salt water.\" He was speedUy introduced to Sir Fran cis Varney, who was seated in the same posture as he had been left by Henry Ban nerworth not many minutes before. \" Admiral Bell,\" said Sir Francis, rising, and bowing to that individual in the most poUte, calm, and dignified manner imaginable, \"permit me to express the honour I feel at this unexpected visit.\" \" None of your gammon.\" \" WUl you be seated? Allow me to offer you such refreshments as this poor house affords.\" \" D\u2014 n all this! You know, Sir Fran cis, I don't want none o' this palaver. It's for all the world like a Frenchman, when you are going to give him a broadside; he makes grimaces, throws dust in your eyes, and tries to stab you in the back. Oh, no! none of that for me.\" \"iBhould say not, Admiral BeU. I shonld not like it myself, and I dare say you are a man of too much experience not to perceive when yon are or are not im- posed upon.\" \" WeU, what is that to yon? D\u2014 n me, I didn't come here to talk to you about myself.\" \" Then may I presume upon your courtesy so far as to beg that you wiU enUghten me upon the object of your visit?\" \" Yes ; in pretty quick time. Just tell me where you have stowed away my ne- phew, Charles Holland?\" \" Really, I \" \"Hold your slack, will you, and hear me out ; if he's living, let him out, and I'll say no more about it ; that's Uberal, you know ; it ain't terms everybody would offer you.\""], [176, "166 VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE. \"You were to have fought a duel with him, and now he's gone.\" \" I am here,\" said Varney. \"Ay,\" said the admiral, \" that's as plain as a purser's shirt upon a handspike ; but that's the very reason why my nevy ain't here, and that's all about it,\" \"And that's marvellous little, so far as the sense is concerned,\" said Varney, with out the movement of a muscle. \" Any friend of yours,\" said Varney, blandly, \" wiU be received and treated as such upon an errand of such consequence; and now our conference has, I presume, concluded?\" \" Yes, yes ; I've done. Damme, no \u2014 yes \u2014 no. I will keel-haul you but I'll know something of roy nevy, Charles Holland.\" \" Good-day, Admiral Bell.\" As Varney spoke, he placed his hand upon the bell which he had near him, to summon an attendant to conduct the ad miral out. The latter, who had said a vast deal more than he ever intended, left the room in a great rage, protesting to himself that he would amply avenge his nephew, Charles HoUand. \" It is said that people of your class don't like fighting mortal men ; now, you have disposed of him lest he should dispose of you.\" '* That is explicit, but it is to no purpose, since the gentleman in question hasn't placed himself at my disposal.\" \" Then, damme, I will.

Come fair or foul, I'm a tar for all men \u2014 a seaman ever ready to face a foe; so here goes, you lubberly moon-manufac tured cal'.\" He proceeded homeward, considerably vexed and annoyed that he had been treated with so much calmness, and all knowledge ot his nephew denied. When he got back, he quarrelled heartily with Jack Pringle\u2014 made it up\u2014 drank grog\u2014 quarrelled \u2014 made it up, and finished with grog again \u2014 until he went to bed, swearing he should like to fire a broadside at the whole of the French army, and annihilate it at once. \" I hear, admiral; but it is scarcely civil, to say the least of it. However, as you are somewhat eccentric, and do not, I dare say, mean all your words imply, I am quite wil ling to make you every allowance.\" \"I don't want any allowance; d \u2014 n you and your allowance, too. Nothing but allowance of grog \u2014 and a pretty good allowance, too\u2014 will do for me; and I tell you, Sir Francis Varney,\" said the admiral, with much wrath, \" that you are a d \u2014 d lubberly hound, and I'll fight you. Yes, I'm ready to hammer away, or with any thing from a pop-gun to a ship's-gun. You don't come over me with your gammen, I tell you. You've murdered Charles Hol land because you couldn't face him \u2014 that's thc truth of it.\" With this wish he fell asleep. Early next morning, Henry Banner worth sought Mr. Chillingworth, and hav ing found him, he said, in a serious tone\u2014 \" Mr. Chillingworth, I have rather a serious savour to ask you, and one which you may hesitate iu granting.\" \" It must be very serious, indeed,\" said Mr. Chillingworth, \" that I should hesitate to grant it to you. But pray inform me what it is that you deem so serious.\" \" With the other part of your speech, Admiral Bell, allow me to say, you have mixed up a serious accusation \u2014 one I can not permit to pass lightly.\" \" Will you or not fight?\" \"Oh, yes; I shall be happy to serve you any way that I can. I hope this wiU be an answer to your accusation, also.\" \" That's settled, then.\" \" Why, I am not captions, Admiral Bell, but it is not generally usual for the princi pals to settle the preliminaries themselves. Doubtless you, in your career of fame and glory, know something of the manner in which gentlemen demean themselves on these occasions.\" \" Sir Francis Varney and I must have a meeting,\" said Henry. \" Have you reaUy determined upon such a course?\" said Mr. ChUUngworth. \" You know the character of your adversary?\" \"That is all settled. I have given a challenge, and he has accepted it ; so all other considerations verge themselves into one \u2014 and that is the when, where, and how.\" \" I see,\" said Mr. Chillingworth. \u2014 \" Well, since it cannot be helped on your part, I will do what is requisite for you. Do you wish anything to be done or insisted on in particular in this affair?\" \"Oh, d \u2014 n you! Yes, I'U send some oneto do all this. Yes, yes; Jack Pringle will be the man, though Jack ain't a holi day, shora-going, smooth-spoken swab, but as good a seaman as ever trod deck or handled a boarding-pike.\" \" Nothing, with regard to Sir Francis Varney, that I may not leave to your dis cretion.

Jack, a-hoy ! a-hoy I\" shouted the admiral, as a sudden recollection of his challenge came across his memory; \" Jack Pringle, a-hoy ! d \u2014 n you, where are you? \u2014 you're nevor at hand when you're wanted. Oh, you lubber \u2014 a-hoy!\" \" A-hoy !\" shouted a voice, as the door opened, and Jack thrnst his head in ; \" what cheer, messmate?

FareweU for the present.\" \" Oh, you lubberly \" The door was shut in a minute, and Jack Pringle disappeared. \" Hilloa, Jack Pringle, yon don't mean to say you'll desert your colours, do you, you dumb dog?\" \" Who say's I'U desert the ship as she's sea-worthy?\" \" Then why do you go away?\" \" Because I won't be called lubberly. I'm as good a man as ever swabbed a deck, and don't care who says to the con trary. I'll stick to the ship as long as she's sea-worthy,\" said Jack. \" WeU, come here, and just Usten to the log, and be d \u2014 d to you,\" \"What's the orders now, admiral?\" said Jack; \" though, as we are paid off\u2014 \" \"There, take that, will you? said Ad miral Bell, as he flung a pillow at Jack, being the only thing in the shape of a missile within reach. Mr. Chillingworth immediately set about the conducting of the affair thus confided to bim ; and tbat no time might be lost, he determined to set out at once for Sir Francis Vamey's residence. \" Things with regard to this family seem to have gone on wild of late,\" thought Mr. Chillingworth | \" this may bring affairs to a conclusion, though I had much rather they had come to some other. My life for it, there is a juggle or a mystery some where ; I will do this, and then we shall see what wUl come of it ; if Sir Francis Varney meets him\u2014 and at this moment I can see no reason why he should not do so\u2014 it wiU tend much to deprive him of the mystery about him ; but if, on the other hand, he refuse \u2014 but then that's all improbable, because he has agreed to do so. I fear, however, that such a man as Varney is a dreadful enemy to encounter \u2014 he is cool and unruffled \u2014 and that gives him all the advantage in such affairs; but Henry's nerves are not bad, though shaken by these untoward events; but time will show\u2014 I would it were all over.\" Jack ducked, and the pillow produced a clatter in the washhand-stand among the crockery, as Jack said \u2014 \" There's a mutiny in the ship, and hark how the cargo clatters ; wUl you have it back again?\" \" Come, will you? I've been dreaming, Jack.\" With these thoughts and feelings strangely intermixed, Mr. Chillingworth set forward for Sir Francis Vamey's house. \"Dreaming! what's that?\" \"Thinking of something when you are asleep, you swab.\" \" Ha, ha, ha !'* laughed Jack ; \" never did such a thing in my life \u2014 ha, ha, ha i What's the matter now ?\" \" I'll tell you what's the matter. Jack Pringle, you are becoming mutinous, and I won't have it; if you don't hold your jaw and draw in your slacks, I'll bave an other second.\" \"Another second ! what's in tbe wind, now?' said Jack. \"Is this the dream?\" * * * * \u00bb \u00bb Admiral Bell slept soundly enough, though, towards morning, he fell into a strange dream, and thought he was yard arm and yard-arm with a strange fish \u2014 something of the mermaid species. \" Well,\" exclaimed the admiral, after a customary benedicrion of his eyes and limbs, \"what's to come next? May I be spliced to a shark if I understand what"], [179, "THE FEAST OF BLOOD. 169 \"If ever I dream when I'm alongside a strange craft, then it is a dream ; but old Admiral Bell ain't the man to sleep when there's any work to be done.\" \"That's uncommon true,\" said Jack, turning a quid. \" WeU, then, I'm going to fight.'' \"Fight!\" exclaimed Jack. \"Avast, there, I don't sec where's thc enemy \u2014 none o' that gammon ; Jack Pringle can fight, 1 too, and will lay alongside his admiral; bnt he don't see the enemy anywhere.\" \"Y'ou don't understand these things, so I'll tell you. I have had a bit of talk with Sir Francis Varney, and I am going to : fight him.\" \" What the tcamphigher ?\" remarked j Jack, parenthetically. \"Yes.\" fight him, at any rate. I'U go and see he don't back out, the warmint.\" \" Then go along, Jack ; and mind, don't you go blazing away like a fire ship, and letting everybody know what's going on, or it 'II be stopped.\" \" I'll not spoil sport,\" said Jack, as he left the room, to go at once to Sir Francis Varney, charged with the conducting of tho important cartel ofthe admiral. Jack made the best of his way with becoming gravity and expedition until be reached the gate of the admiral's enemy. Jack raDg loudly at the gate; there seemed, if one might judge by his counte nance, a something on his mind, thai Jack was almost another man. The gate was opened by a servant, who inquired what he wanted there. \"WeU then,\" resumed Jack, \"then we | shall sec another blaze, at least, afore we die ; but he's an odd fish \u2014 one of Davy | Jones's sort.\" \"I don't care abont that ; he may be anything he likes; but Admiral Bell ain't a-going to have bis nephew burned and eaten, and sucked like I don'c know what, : by a vampjre, or by any other confounded land-shark.\" \"The watnphigher.\" \" Who ?\" \"The wampbigher.\" The servant frowned, and was about to say something uncivil to Jack, who winked at him very hard, and then said, \u2014 \"Oh, may be you don't know him, or won't know him by that name; I wants to see Sir Francis Varney.\" \" He's at home,\" said the servant; \" who are you?\" \" Show me up, then. I'm Jack Pringle, and I'm come from Admiral Bell; I'm the admiral's friend, you see, so none of your black looks.\" \" In course,\" said Jack, \" we ain't a- going to put np with nothing of that sort, and if so be as how he has put him out of the way, why it's our duty to send him aitcr him, and square the board.\" \"That's tbe thing, Jack; now you know you mnst go to Sir Francis Varney and tell him you come from me.\" \" I don't care if I goes on my own ac- count,\" said Jack. \" Tbat won't do ; I've challenged him, ] and I must fight hin..\" \"In course you will,\" returned Jack; || \"and if he blows you away, why I'll take your place, and have a blaze myself.\" The admiral gave a look at Jack of great admiration, and then said, \u2014 \" You are a d \u2014 d good seaman, Jack, , but he's a knight, and might say no to r that; but do you go to him, and tell him that you come from me to settle the wbeD and the where this duel is to be fought.\" '\u2022 Single fight?\" said Jack. \"Yes; consent to do anything that is fair,\" said the admiral, \"but let it be as soou as you can. Now, do you under- stand what I have said?\" The servant seemed amazed, as well -^s rather daunted, at Jack's address ; he showed him, however, into the hall, where Mr. Chillingworth had just that moment arrive;!, and was waiting for an interview with Varney.

CHI L- LINGWORTH was much an- noyed to se'j Jack Pringle in the ball, and Jack was somewhat 6dt- prised at see- ing Mr. Chil- lingworth there at that time in the morning; they \" Yes, to be sure ; I ain't lived all these years without knowing your lingo.\" \"Then go at once; and don't let the honour of Admiral Bell and old England sutler, Jack.

Admiral Bell ain't thc man to do that, and if he were, I'm not the man to back him in doing what isn't fair or right ; but he won't do it.\" \" But, gentlemen, this must not be ; Mr. Henry Bannerworth must not be dis appointed, and Admiral Bell must not be disappointed. Moreover, I have accepted the two cartels, and I am ready and willing to fight ; one at a time, I pre sume ?\" annouce that Sir Francis would see them both. Without saying anything to the servant or each other, they ascended the staircase, and were shown into the apartment whero Sir Francis Varney received them. \"Gentlemen,\" said Sir Francis, in his usual bland tone, \" you are welcome.\" \"Sir Francis,\" said Mr. Chillingworth, \"I have come upon matters of some imporance ; may I crave a separate au dience ?\" \" And I too,\" said Jack Pringle ; \" I come as tho friend of Admiral Bell, I want a private audience ; but, stay, I don't care a rope's end who knows who I am , or what I come about ; say you are ready to name time and place, and I'm as dumb as a figure-head ; that is saying something, at all events, aud now I'm done.\" \" Why, gentlemen,\" said Sir Francis, with a quiet smile, \"as you have both come upon the 6ame errand, and as there may arise a controversy upon the point of precedence, you had better be both pre sent, as I must arrange this matter myself upon due inquiry.\" \"I do not exactly understand this,\" said Mr. Chillingworth ; \" do you Mr. Pringle ? Perhaps you can enlighten me ?\" \" Sir Francis, after what you havo said, I must take upon myself, on the part of Mr. Henry Bannerworth, to decline meeting you, if you cannot name a friend with whom I can arrange this affair.\" \"Ah !\" said Jack Pringle, \"that's right enough. I recollect very well when Jack Miz.cn fought Tom Foremast, they had their seconds. Admiral Bell can't do any thing in the dark. No, no, d \u2014 e ! all must be above board.\" \" Gentlemen,\" said Sir Francis Varney, \"you see tho dilemma lam in. Your principals have both challenged me. I am ready to fight any one, or both of them as tbe case may be. Distinctly un derstand that ; because it is a notion of theirs that I will not do so, or that I shrink from them ; but I am a stranger in this neighbourhood, and havo no one upon whom I could call upon to relinquish so much, as they run the risk of doing by attending n.e on the field.\" \"Then your acquaintances are no friends, d e I\" said Jack Pringle, spitting through his teeth into the bars of a beautifully polished grate. \" I'd stick to anybody\u2014 the devil himself, leave alone a wamphiger \u2014 if so be as how I had been his friend aud drunk grog from tbe same cau. They are a set of lubbers.\" \"I have not been here long enough to form any such friendships, Mr. Chilling worth ; but can confidently rey on your honour and lhat of your principal, and will freely and fairly meet him.\" \"But, Sir Francis, you forget the fact, in thus actng, myself for Mr. Banner worth, and this person for Admiral Bell, we do much, and have our characters at \" If,\" said Jack, \" as how you came here upon the same errand as I, and I as you, why we have both come about fighting Sir Francis Varney.\" \"Yes,\" 6aid Sir Francis, \"what Mr. Pringle says is, I believe, correct to a letter. I have a challenge from both your princi pals, and am ready to give you both tho satisfaction yon desire, provided the first encounter will permit me the honour of joining in the second. You, Mr. Pringle, are aware of the chances of war ?\" \"I should say so,\" said Jack, with a wink and a nod of a familiar character. \"I've seen a few of them.\" \" Will you proceed to make tho neces sary arrangements between you both, gen tlemen ? My affection for the one equals fully tho good will I bear the other, and I cannot give a preference in so delicate a matter; proceed, gentlemen.\" Mr Chillingworth looked at Jack, and Jack Pringle looked at Mi*. ChiUingworth, and then the former said \u2014 \"Well, the admiral means fighting, and I am come to settle the necessaries ; Sray let me know what are your terms, Ir. What-d'ye-call'em.\" \" I am agreeable to anything that is at aU reasonable \u2014 pistols, I presume ?\" \" Sir Francis Varney,\" said Mr. Chil- stake ; nay, more, our lives and fortunes. These may be small ; but they are every thing to us. Allow me to say on my own behalf, that 1 will not permit my principal to meet you unless you can name a second"], [181, "THE FEAST OF BLOOD. 171 as is usual with gentlemen on such occa sions.\" \" That will, I hope, remove your scru ples, Mr. Chillingworth,\" said Varney, with a courteous smile. \"I regret, while I declare to you my entire willingness to meet you, that I cannot comply, through utter ina bility to do so, with your request Let this go forth to the world as 1 have stated it, and let it be an answer to any asper sions that may be uttered as to my un willingness to fight\" There was a pause of some moments. Mr. Chillingworth was resolved that, come of it what would, he would not permit Henry to fight, unless Sir Francis Varney should appoint a friend, and then they could meet upon equal terms. Jack Pringle whistled, and chewed and turned his quid \u2014 hitched up his trousers, and looked wistfully from one to the other, as he said \u2014 , \"But will Admiral Bell do this?\" asked Mr. Chillingworth. \" His second says so, and has, I daresay, influence enough with him to induce that person to act in conformity with his pro mise.\" \"In course he will. Do you think he would be the man to hang back? Oh, no; he would be the last to leave Jack Pringle in the lurch \u2014 no. Depend upon it, Sir Francis, he'll be as sure to do what I say, as I have said it.\" \" Aster that assurance, I cannot doubt it,\" said Sir Francis Varney; \" this act of kindness will, indeed, lay me under a deep and lasting obligation to Admiral Bell, which I fear I shall never be able to pay.\" \"You need not trouble yourself about that,\" said Jack Pringle ; \" the admiral will credit all, and you can pay off old scores when his turn comes in the field.\" as ne saiu \u2014 , \" So then it's likely to be no fight at all Francis what's-o'-name?\" \"It seems like it, Mr. Pringle,'' replied Varney, with a meaning smile; \"unless you can be more complaisant towards my self, and kind towards the admiral.\" \" Why, not exactly that,\" said Jack ; \" it's a pity to stop good play in the be ginning, just because some little thing is wrong in the tackling.\" \"Perhaps your skill and genius may enable us to find some medium course that we may pursue with pleasure and profit. What say yon, Mr. Pringle?\" \"All I know about genius, as you call it, is the Flying Dutchman; or some such odd out o' the way fisb. But, as I said, 1 am not one to spoil sport, nor more is the admiral. Ob, no, we are all true men and good.\" \"I beUeve it,\" said Varney, bowing politely. \"You needn't keep your figure-head on the move ; I can see you just as well. Howsoever, as I was saying, I don't like to spoil sport, and sooner than both parties should be disappointed, my prin cipal shall become your second, Sir Francis.\" \"I will not forget,\" said Varney ; \"he deserves every consideration ; but now, Mr. Chillingworth, I presume lhat we may come to some understanding respecting this meeting, which you were so kind as to do me tho honour of seeking.\" \" I cannot object to its taking place. I shall be most happy to meet your second in the field, and will arrange with him.\" \"I imagine that, under the circum stances, it will be barely necessary to go to that length of ceremony. Future inter views can be arranged later; name the time and place, and after that we can 6ettle aU the rest on the ground.\" \"Yes,\" said Jack; \"it will be time enough, surely, to see the admiral when we are upon the ground. I'll warrant the old buffer is a true brick as ever was; there's no flinching about him.\" \" I am satisfied,\" said Varney. \" And I also,\" said Chillingworth ; \" but understand, Sir Francis any default for seconds makes the meeting a blank.\" \" I will not doubt Mr. Pringle's honour so much as to believo it possible.\" \" I'm d\u2014 d,\" said Jack, \" if you ain't a trump-card, and no mistake ; it's a great pity as you is a wamphigher.\" \"The time, Mr. Chillingworth?\" \" To-morrow, at seven o'clock,\" replied that gentleman. \" What, Admiral Bell !\" exclaimed Varney, lifting his eyebrows with surprise. \" What, Charles Holland's uncle !\" ex claimed Mr. Chillingworth, in accents of amazement. \" And why not :\" said Jack, with great gravity. \" I will pledge my word\u2014 Jack Pringle's word\u2014 that Admiral Bell shall be second to Sir Francis Varney, during his scrimmage with Mr. Henry Bannerworth. That wdl let the matter go on; there can be no back-out then, eh?\" continued Jack Pringle, with a knowing nod at Chilling worth as he spoke. \"The place, sir?\" \" The best place that I can think of is a level meadow half-way between here and Bannerworth Hall; but that is your privi lege, Sir Francis Varney.\" \" I waive it, and am much obliged to you for the choice of thc spot; it seems of"], [182, "172 VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE; OR, the best character imaginable.

By so doing you will seriously damage the honour of Mr. Henry Bannerworth.\" \" I will not, you may rely upon it ; but, Mr. Chillingworth, do I not see you in the character of a second ?\" \"Don't mention it,\" said Jack; \"the admiral's the man as'd lend anybody a helping hand in case of distress like the present; and I'll pledge my word \u2014 Jack Pringle's too, as that he'U do what's right, i and give up his turn to Mr. Henry Ban ! nerworth; 'cause, you see, he can have his : turn afterwards, you know \u2014 it's only wait- ing awhile.\" \"That's ali,\" said Sir Francis. Jack Pringle made a sea bow and took his leave, as he followed Mr. Chillingworth, and they both left thc house together, to return to Bannerworth Hall. \" Well,\" said Mr. Chillingworth, \" I am glad that Sir Francis Varney bas got over the difficulty of having no seconds; for it would not be proper or safe to meet a man without a friend with him.\" \"You do, sir.\" \"To Mr. Henry?\" \" The same, sir.\" \" Have you reflected upon the probable consequences of such an act, should any serions mischief occur?\" \" What I have undertaken, Mr. March dale, I will go through with; the conse quences I have duly considered, and yet you see me in the character of Mr. Henry Bannerworth's friend.\" \" I am happy to see you as sucb, and I do not think Henry could find a worthier. But this is beside the question. What in- rluccd me to make the remark was this,\u2014 had I been at the hall, you will admit that Henry Bannerworth would have chosen myself, without any disparagement to you, Mr. Chillingworth.\" \"Well, sir, what then?\" demanded Mr. Chillingworth. \" Why, I am a single man, I can live, reside, and go any where; one country will suit me as well as another. I shall suffer no loss, but as for you, you will be ruined in every particular ; for if you go in the character of a second, you will not be excused ; for all the penalties incurred, yonr profession of a surgeon wul not ex- cuse you.\" \"I see all that, sir.\" \"What I propose is, that you should accompany the parties to the field, but in your own proper character of surgeon, and permit me to take that of second to Mr. Bannerworth.\" \"This cannot be done, unless by Mr. Henry Bannerworth's consent,'\" said Mr. Chillingworth. \" Then I wiU accompany you to Ban nerworth Hall, and see Mr. Henry, whom I will request to permit me to do what I have mentioned to you.\" Mr. ChiUingworth could not but admit the reasonableness of this proposal, and it i \"It ain't the right thing,\" said Jack, I hitching up his trousers; \"but I was afeard as how he would back out, and that would be just the wrong thing for the admiral; ] he'd go raving mad.\" 1 They had got but very few paces from Sir Francis Varney's house, when they were joined by Marchdale. \"Ah,\" he said, as he came up, \"I see you have been to Sir Francis Varney'*-, if I may judge from the direction whence you're coming, and you're proximity.\" \"Yes, we bave,\" said Mr. ChiUingworth. \" 1 thought you had left these parts?\" \" I had intended to do so,\" repUed Marchdale; \"but second thoughts are sometimes best, you know.\" \"Certainly.\" \" I have so much friendship for the family at the haU, that, notwithstanding I am compeUed to be absent from the man- sion itself, yet I cannot quit the neigh- bourhood while there are circumstances of such a character hanging about them.

I went there last night.\" \"And I too.\" \"Ob, not John \u2014 Jack Pringle, you mean,\" said that individual. ChiUingworth now went in search of Henry, and sent bim to the apartment where Mr. Marchdale was with Jack Pringle, and then he found tbe admiral waiting the return of Jack with impa tience. \"Admiral,\" he said, \"I perceive yon are unwell this morning.\" \"Unwell be d \u2014 d,\" said the admiral, starting up with surprise. \"Wlo ever heard that old Admiral Bell looked UI just afore he was going into action?

There is a particular reason ; he has some- thing to communicate from Sir Francis Varney, I beUeve.\" The admiral gave a look of some amaze- ment at Mr. Chillingworth, and then he said, muttering to himself \u2014 \" If Jack Pringle should have betrayed tte \u2014 but, no ; he could not do that, he is too true. I'm snre of Jack; and how did that son of a gallipot hint about the odd fish I sent Jack to?\" Filled with a dubious kind of belief which he had about something he had heard of Jack Pringle, he entered the room, where he met Marchdale, Jack Pringle, and Henry Bannerworth. Imme- diately afterwards Mr. ChiUingworth en- tered the apartment. \" I have,\" said he, \" been to Sir Francis Varney, and there had an interview with him, and with Mr. Pringle ; when I found we were both intent upon the same object, namely, an encounter with the knight by our principals.\" \" Eh?\" said the admiral. \"It seems to me,\" said Marchdale, \" that this affair has not been discreetly conducted; but somewhat unusually and strangely, to say the least of it.\" \"You see,\" said Chillingworth, \"Sir Francis was willing to fight both Henry and tbe admiral, as he told us.\" \" Yes,\" said Jack; \" he told us he would fight us both, if so be his light was not doused in the first brush.\" \"That was aU that was wanted,\" said the admiral. \" We could expect no' more.\" \" But then he desired to meet you with out any second; but, of course, I would not accede to this proposal.

I knew you would not spoil sport, and that there had better be a fight than no fight. I believe you'd sooner see a scrimmage than none, and so it's all arranged.\" \" Very well,\" said the admiral; \" I only wish Mr. Henry Bannerworth had been his second; 1 think I was entitled to the first meeting.\" \" It is.\" \"But, Mr. Bannerworth, in resigning my character of second to Mr. Marchdale, I only do so because it appears and seems to be the opinion of all present that I can be much better employed in another capacity.\" \"Certainly, Mr. Chillingworth ; and I cannot but feel that I am under thc same obligations to you for the readiness and zeal with which you have acted.\" \" I have done what I have done,\" said Chillingworth, \" because I belioved it was my duty to do so.\" \"Mr! Chillingworth bas undoubtedly acted most friendly and efficiently in this affair,\" said Marchdale; \"and he dees not relinquish the part sor the purpose of escaping a friendly deed, but tu perform one in which he may act in a capacity thit no one else can.\" \" No,\" Jack, \"you warn't, for Mr. Chillingworth was there first ; first come first served, you know.\" \"Well, well, I mustn't grumble at an other man's luck ; mine '11 come in turn ; but it had better be so than a disappoint ment altogether, I'll be second to this Sir Francis Varney ; he shall have fair play, as I'm an admiral; but, d \u2014 e, ho shall fight \u2014 yes, yes, he Bhall fight\" \" And to this conclusion I would come,\" said Henry, \" I wish him to fight; now I will take care that he shall not have any opportunity of putting me on one side quietly.\" \" There is one thing,\" observed March dale, \"that I wished to propose. After what has passed, I should not have re turned, bad I not some presentiment that something was going forward in which I could be useful to my friend.\" \"Oh,\" said the admiral, with a huge \"That is true,\" said the admiral. \"And now,\" said ChiUingworth, \"you are to meet to-morrow morning in the meadow at the bottom of the valley, hall way between here and Sir Francis Var ney's house, at seven o'clock iu the morn iDg'\" More conversation parsed among them, and it was agreed that they should meet early the next morning, and that, of course, the affair should be kept a strict secret. Marchdale for that night should remain in the house, and the admiral should ap pear as if little or nothing was the mattei ; and he and Jack Pringle retired, to talk over in private all the arrangements. Henry Bannerworth and Marchdale also retired, and Mr. Chillingworth, after a time, retired, promising to be with them in time for the meeting next morning. Much of that day was spent by Henry Bannerworth in his own apartment, in writing documents and letters of one kind and another ; but at night he had not finished, sor he had been compelled to be about, and in Flora's presence, to prevent anything from being suspected. Marchdale was much with him, and in secret examined the arms, ammunition, and bullets, and saw all was right for tbe next morning; and when he had done, he said \u2014 twist of his countenance. \" What I was about to say was this \u2014 Mr. Chillingworth has much to lose a3 he is situated, and I nothing as I am placed. I am chained down to no spot of earth. I am above following a profession \u2014 my means, I mean, place me above the neces sity. Now, Henry, allow me to be your second in this affair ; Mr. Chillingworth to attend in his professional capacity ; he may be of service \u2014 of great service to one of the principals ; whereas, if he go in any other capacity, he will inevitably have his own safety to consult.\" \" That is most unquestionably true,\" said Henry, \" and, to my mind, the best plan that can be proposed. What say you, Admiral Bel), will you act with Mr. Marchdale in this affair?\" \" Oh, IS\u2014 Yes\u2014 certainly \u2014 I don't care. Mr. Marchdale is Mr. Marchdale, I believe, and that's all I care about. If we quarrei to-day, and have anything to do to-mor row, in course, to-morrow I can put off my quarrel for next day; it will keep\u2014 that's all I have to say at present.\" \"Then this is a final arrangement?\" said Mr. Chillingworth. \"Now, Henry, you must permit me to insist that you take some hours' repese, else you will scarcely be as you ought to be.\" \"Very good,\" said Henry. \"I have ju.t finished, and can take your advice.\" After many thoughts aud reflections, Henry Bannerworth fell into a deep sleep, and slept several hours ia calmness and"], [185, "VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE; OR, THE FEAST OF BLOOD. 175 TBE DUE** BKTWBEK VARNEY AND HENRY BANNERWORTH quletnde, and at an early hour he awoke, and taw Marchdale sitting by him. \"Is it time, Marchdale? I have not overslept myself, have I?\" \"No; time enongh \u2014 time enough,\" said Marchdale. \" I should have let you sleep longer, but I should have awakened you in good time.\" It was now the gray light of morning, and Henry arose and began to prepare for the encounter. Marchdale stole to Admi- ral Bell's chamber, but he and Jack Pringle were ready. Few words were spoken, and those few were in a whisper, and the whole party jest the Hall in as noiseless a manner as possible. It was a mild morning, and yet it was cold at that time in ihe mon ing, just as day is beginning to oa\u00bbi in the east There was, however, ample time to reach the rendezvous. It was a curious party that which was now proceeding towards the spot appointed for the duel, the result of which might have so important an effect on the interests of those who were to be engaged in it. It would be difficult for us to analyse the different and conflicting emotions that fUled the breasts of the various individuals composing that party \u2014 the hopes and fears\u2014 the doubts and surmises that were given utterance to; though w are com- Wo, 23."], [186, "176 VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE ; OR, society by a cold reserve, which few conld break through. Had this family suffered in any noble cause, or had the misfortunes which had come over them, and robbed their ances- tral house of its lustre, been an unavoid- able dispensation of providence, they would have borne the bard position with a different aspect; but it must be remem- bered, that to the faults, the vices, and the criminality of some of their race, was to be attributed their present depressed state. It has been seen during tha progress of our tale, that its action bas been tolerably confined to Bannerworth Hall, its adjacent meadows, and tho seat of Sir Francis Varney; the only person at any distance, knowing anything of the wttmn.-tances, or feeling any intere-t in tlioa, being Mr. ChiUingworth, the surgeon, who, from personal feeling, as well as from profes- sional habit, was not likely to make a family's affairs a subject of gossip. A change, however, was tf hand \u2014 a change of a most startling ana alarming character to Varney \u2014 one whieh he might expect, yet not be well prepared for. This period of serenity was to pass away, and he was to become most alarmingly popular. We wiU not, however, anticipate, but proceed at once to detail as briefly as may be the hostile meeting. It would appear that Varney, now that he had once consented to the definitive arrangements of a duel, shrunk not in any way from carrying them out, nor in the slightest attempted to retard arrangements which migbt be fatal to himself. The early morning was one of those cloudy ones so frequently occurring in our sickle climate, when the cleverest weather prophet would find it difficult to predict what the next hour might produce. There was a kind of dim gloominess over all objects; and as there were no bright Ughts, there were no deep shadows \u2014 ittaro eonaeqa\u00abnce of which was a same ness of effect over the landscape, that robbed it of aunty of its msual beauties. Such nos thc state of things when Marchdale accompanied Henry and Ad miral Bell from Bannerworth Hall across the garden in the direction of the hilly wood, \"close to which was the spot intended for the scene of encounter. pelled to acknowledge that though to Henry the character of the man he was going to meet in mortal fight was of a most ambiguous and undefined nature, and though no one could imagine the means ho might be endowed with for protection against the arms of man \u2014 Henry, as we said, strode firmly forward with unflinch ing resolution. His heart was set on re covering the happiness of his sister, and he would not falter. So far, then, we may consider that at length proceedings of a hostile character were so far clearly and fairly arranged be tween Henry Bannerworth and that most mysterious being, who certainly, from some cause or :another, had betrayed no inclination to meet an opponeut in that manner which is sanctioned, bad as it is, by the usages of soeiety. But whether his motive was one of cow ardice or mercy, remained yet to be seen. It might be that he feared himself receiving some mortal injury, which would at once put a stop to that preternatural career of existence which he affected to shudder at, and yet evidently took considerable pains to prolong. Upon the other hand, it is just possible that some consciousness of invulnerability on his own part, or of great power to inj ure his antagonist, might be the cause why he had held back so long from fighting the duel, and placed so many obstacles in the way of the usual necessary arrangements incidental to such occasions. Now, however, there would seem to be no possible means of escape. Sir Francis Varney must fight or fly, for he was sur rounded by too many opponents. To be sure, he might have appealed to the civil authorities to protect him, and to sanction him in his refusal to commit what undoubtedly is an illegal offence; but then there cannot be a question that the whole of the circumstances would come out, and meet the public eye \u2014 the result of which would inevitably be, his seeming acquisition of a reputation as unenviable at it would be universal. It had so happened, that the peeaU\u00abr position of the BaftnerWorth family kept their'acquaintance within -extremely narrow Unfit s, and greatly iadjsposed them to set themselves up as marks for pecafiar ob servation. Jack Pringle came on at a lazy pace behind with his bands in his pockets, and looking as unconcerned as if he had just come out for a morning's stroll, and scarcely knew whether he saw what was going on or not. The curious contortion into which he twisted his countenance, and the different Once holding, as they had, a proud po sition in the county, and being looked upon quite as magnates of the land, they did not now court the prying eye of curiosity to look upon their poverty; bat rather with a gloomy melancholy they lived apart, and repeUed the advances of"], [187, "THE FEAST OP BLOOD. 177 odd-lcoking lumps tbat appeared in it from time to time, may be accounted for by a quid of unusual size, which he seemed to be masticating with a relish quite hor- rifying to one unused to so barbarous a luxury. The admiral had strictly enjoined him not to interfere on pain of being considered a lubber and no seaman for the remainder of his existence \u2014 threatened penalties whicb, of course, had their own weight with Jack, and accordingly he came just to see the row in as quiet a way as possible, per- haps not without a hope that something might turn up in the shape of a caicsus belli, that might justify him in adopting a threatening attitude towards somebody. \" Now, Master Henry,\" said the admi- ral, \" none of your palaver to me as we go along; recollect I don't belong to your party, you know. I've stood friend to two or thee fellows in my time ; but if any- body had salid to me, ' Admiral Bell, the next time you go out on a quiet little shooting party, it will be as second to a vampyre,' I'd have said, 'you're a liar.'

Come, now, this vam pyr'e's a deoenter fellow than I thought him. He means, after all, to let us have a pop at him.\" They had now reached so close to the spot, that Sir Francis Varney, who, to all appearance, had been waiting, emerged from among the treeB, rolled up in his dis mal-looking cloak, and if possible looking logger and thinner than ever he had looked before. His face wore a singularly cadaverous looking aspect. His very lips were white, and there was a curious, pinkish-looking circle round each of his eyes, that im parted to his whole countenance a most uninviting appearance. He turned his eyes from one to the other of those who were advancing towards him, until he saw tha admiral, upon which he gave such a grim and horrible smile, that the old man exclaimed\u2014 \"I believe you it is,\" said the admiral; \"so mind if you don't hit him, I'm not a goiog to tell you how \u2014 all you've got to do is, to fire low ; but that's no business of mine.

I'm notgoingto let him creep out of the thing on such a shabby pretence, I can tell you. I rather think I ought to have gone to his house carly this morning ; only, as I said I never would cross his threshold again, I won't.\" \" It's a lie, and you know it.\" \"Very good,\" said Jack ; \"don't you recollect when that ere iron bullet walked over your bead, leavinf,- a nice little nick all the way, off Bergem-ap-Zoom ? That was the time\u2014 blessed if you didn't give just such a grin as that.\" \" I didn't, you rascal.\" \"And I say you did.\" \" Mutiny, by God '.'' \" Go to blazes !\" \"I wonder if he'll come,\" said Mr. Marchdale to Henry. \"After all, you know he may tako tu flight, and shun an encounter which, it is evident, he has entered into but tardily. \"I hope nqt,\" said Henry; \"and yet I must own that your supposition has several times crossed my mind. If, however, he do not meet me, he never can appear at all iu the country, and we should, at least, be rid of him, and all his troublesome impor tunities concerning the Hall. I would not allow that man, on any account, to cross How far this contention might bave gone, having now reached its culminating point, had tue admiral aud Jack been alone, it is hard to say ; but as it was, Henry and Marchdale interfered, and so the quarrel was patched up for the moment, in order to give place to more important affairs. Varney seemed to think, that after the"], [188, "VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE ; OR, 178 smUing welcome he had given to his second, he had done quite enough ; for there he stood, tall, and gaunt and motionless, if we may except an occasional singular movement of the mouth, and a clap toge ther of his teeth, at times, which was enough to make anybody jump to hear. \"For Heaven's sake,\" said Marchdale, \" do not let ns trifle at such a moment as this.

The admiral, who stood on a level with him, could not see the sort of expression he wore, or, probably, he would have been far from well pleased ; but the others did, and they found something inexpressibly disagreeable in the smirking kind of satis- faction with which the vampyre seemed to regard now the proceedings. \" Confound him,\" whispered Marchdale to Henry, \"one would think he was quite delighted, instead, as we had imagined him, not well pleased at these proceedings. Look how he grins.\" \" It is no matter,\" said Henry; \" let him wear what aspect he may, it is the same to me. And as Heaven is my judge, I here declare, if I did not think myself justified in so doing, I would not raise my hand against this man.\" \"There can be no shadow of a doubt regarding your justification. Have at him, and Heaven protect you.\" \u00ab' Amen !\" The admiral was to give the word to fire, and now he and Marchdale having stepped sufficiently on one side to be out of all pos- sible danger from any stray shot, he com- menced repeating the signal \u2014 \" Are you ready gentlemen? \u2014 Once.\" \" They looked sternly at each other, and each grasped his pistol. \" Twice !\" Sir Francis Varney smiled and looked around him, as il the affair were one of the most common-place description. \"Thrice!\" Varney seemed to be studying the sky rather than attending to the duel. \"Fire !\" said the admiral, and one re- port only struck upon the ear. It was that from Henry's pistol. All eyes were turned upon Sir Francis Varney, who had evidently reserved his fire, for what purpose could not be devised, except a murderous one, the taking of a more steady aim at Henry. Sir Francis, however, seemed in no hurry, but smiled significantly, and gra- dually raised the point of his weapon. \" Did yon hear the word, Sir Francis? I gave it loud enough, I am sure. I never spoke plainer in mylife; did I ever, Jack?\" \" Yes, often,\" said Jack Pringle; \" what's the use of your asking such yarns as them ? You know you have done so often enough when you wanted grog. \" You d\u2014 d rascal, I'll\u2014 I'll have your back scored, I wUL\" \" So you will, when you are afloat again, which you never wUl be\u2014 you're paid off, that's certain.\" These were simple and brief. It was agreed that twelve paces should be mea sured out six each way, from a fixed point; one six to be paced by the admiral, and the other by Marchdale; then they were to draw lots, to see at wbich end of this imaginary Uke Varney was to be placed; after this the signal for firing was to be one, two, three \u2014 fire! A few minutes sufficed to complete these arrangements; the ground was measured in the manner we have stated, and the combatants placed in their respective posi tions, Sir Francis Varney occupying the same spot where he had at first stood, namely, that nearest to the wood and to his own residence. It is impossible that nnder such circum stances the bravest and the calmest of man kind could fail to feel some slight degree of tremour or uneasiness ; and, although we can fairly claim for Henry Banner worth that he was as truly courageous as any right feeling Christian man could wish to be, yet when it was possible that he stood within, as it were, a hair's breadth of eter nity, a strange world of sensations and emo tions found a home in his heart, and he conld not look altogether undaunted on that future which might, for all he knew to the contrary, be so close at hand, as far as he was concerned. It was not that he feared deatb, but that he looked with a decent gravity upon so grave a change as that from this world to the next, and hence was it that his face was pale, and that he looked all the emotion which he really felt. This was the aspect and the bearing of a brave but not a reckless man ; while Sir Francis Varney, on the other hand, seemed, now that he had fairly engaged in the duel, to look upon it and all its attendant cir cumstances with a kind of smirking satis faction, as if he were far more amused than personally interested. This was certainly the more extraor dinary after the manner in which he had tried to evade thc fight and, at all events, was quite a sufficient proof that cowardice"], [190, "180 VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE; Olt, \" You lubberly lout, you ain't a seaman ; a seaman would never mutiny against his admiral ; howsomever, do you hear, Sir Francis, I'll give the matter up, if you don't pay some attention to me.\" Henry looked steadily at Varney, ex pecting every moment to feel his bullet.

There was a number of people of all kinds coming out from the village, ap- parently armed, and shouting.

What did they say ?\" \"If you'll listen they'll teli you soon enough, I'll warrant\" \" May be they will, and yet I'd like to know now.\" Sir Francis Varney looked signifi- cantly at Marehdale, and then waited with downcast eyes for the repetition of the words. \"Down with the vampyre !\" resounded on all sides from the people who came rapidly towards them, and converging towards a centre. \" Burn, destroy, kill the vampyre ! No vampyre \u2014 burn him out ! Down with him\u2014 kill him !\" Then came Mr. Chillingworth's voice, who, with much earnestness, endeavoured to exhort them to moderation, and to re- frain from violence. Sir Francis Varney became very pale and agitated ; he immediately turned, and without taking the least notice, he made for the wood, which lay between him and his own house, leaving the people in the greatest agitation. Mr. Marehdale was not unmoved at this occurrence, but stood his ground with Henry Bannerworth, the admiral, and Jack Pringle, until the mob came very near to them, shouting, and uttering cries of vengeance, and death of all imaginable kinds that it was possible to conceive, against the unpopular vampyre. Pending the arrival of these infuriated persons, we will, in a few words, state how it was that so suddenly a set of circum- stances arose productive of an amount of personal danger to Varney, such as, up to that time, had seemed not at all likely to occur. which commonly belonged to him, as to be the cause of the popular tumult which had now reached such a height. In a moment of thoughtlessness and confidence, he told his wife. Yes, this really clever man, from whom one would not have expected sucb a piece of horrible Indiscretion, actually told his wife all about the vampyre. But such is human nature ; combined with an amount of firmness and reasoning power, that one would have thought to be invulnerable safeguards, we find some weakness which astonishes aU calculation. Such was this of Mr. Chillingworth's. It is true, he cautioned the lady to be secret, and pointed to her the danger of making Varney the Vampyre a theme for : gossip ; but he might as well have whis- ' pered to a hurricane to be so good as not to go on blowing so, as request Mrs. Chil- lingworth to keep a secret Of course she burst into the usual fervent declarations of \"Who was she to tell ? Was she a peison who went about telling things ? When did she see any- body ? Not she, once in a blue moon j\" and then, when Mr. Chillingworth went out, like the King of Otaheite, she invited the neighbours round about to come to take some tea. Under solemn promises of secrecy, six- teen ladies that evening were made ac- quainted with the full and interesting par- ticulars of the attack of the vampyre on Flora Bannerworth, and all the evidence inculpating Sir Francis Varney as the bloodthirsty individual. When the mind comes to consider tbat these sixteen ladies multipUed their infor mation by about four-and-twenty each, we become quite lost in a sea of arithme \u2022 tic, and feel compelled to sum up the whole by a candid assumption that iu four-and-twenty hours not an individual in the whole town was ignorant of the cir cumstances. On the morning before the projected duel, there was an unusual commotion in the streets. People were conversing to gether in little knots, and using rather violent gesticulations. Poor Mr. ChiUing worth! he alone was ignorant of the causes of the popular commotion, and so he went to bed, wondering what an un usual bustle pervaded the Uttle market town, but not at all guessing its origin. Somehow or another, however, the populace, who had determined to make a demonstration ou the following morning against tbe vamypre, thought it highly necessary first to pay some sort of compli ment to Mr. ChiUingworth, and, acettfd- We have before stated there was but one person out of the famUy of the Ban nerworths who was able to say anything of a positive character concerning the singular and inexplicable proceedings at the hall ; and that that person was Mr. Chillingworth, an individual not at all likely to become garrulous upon the snbject But, alas ! the best of men have their weaknesses, and we much regret to say that Mr. CbUlingworth so far in this in stance forgot that admirable discretion"], [193, "I VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE ; OR, THE FEAST OF BLOOD. 183 MR.

Then, in a temporary lull, a lond voice shouted \u2014 \" Down with the vampyre\u2014 down with the vampyre 1\" The truth in an instant burst over the mind of Mr. Chillingworth, and turning to his wife, he exclaimed\u2014 \"I understand it now. You've been gossiping abont Sir Francis Varney, and have caused all this tumult.\" \" I gossip ! Well, I never ! Lay it on me ; it is sure to be my fault. I might have known that beforehand. I always am.\" \"But yon must have spoken of it.\" \"Who have I got to speak to abont it?\" \" Did yon, or did you not?\" \"Who should I tell?\" Mr. Chillingworth was dressed, and he hastened down and entered the street wiffc great desperation. He had a hope that he might be enabled to disperse the crowd, and yet be in time to keep bis appointment at the duel. His appearance was hailed with another shout, for it was considered, of course, that he had come to join in tho attack upon Sir Francis Varney. He found assembled a much more considerable mob than he had imagined, and to his alarm he found many armed with all sorts ol weapons of offence.\" \" Hurrah !\" cried a great lnmpy-looking fellow, who seemed half-mad with the prospect of a disturbance. \"Hurrah! here's the doctor, he'll tell us all about it as we go along. Come on.\" \"For Heaven's sake,\" said Mr. Chil- lingworth, \"stop! What are you about to do all of you?\" \"Burn the vampyre\u2014 bum the vam pyre!\" \"Hold\u2014 hold! this is folly. Let me implore you all to return to your homes, or you will get into serious trouble on this subject.\" This was a piece of advice not at all likely to be adopted; and when the mob found that Mr. Chillingworth was not dis- posed to encourage and countenance it in its violence, they gave another loud shout of defiance, and moved off through the long straggling streets of the-town, in the direction towards Sir Francis Varney's house. It is trne that what were called tho antbo. rities of the town had become alarmed, and were s'irring, but they found themselves in such a frightful minority, that it became out of the question for them to interfere with any effect to stop the lawless pro ceedings of the rioters, so that the infuria ted populace had it all their own way, and in a straggling, di6orderly-lookmg kind of procession they moved off, vowing ven geance as they went against Varney the Vampyre. Hopeless as Mr. Chillingworth thought it was to interfere with any degree of effect in the proceedings of the mob, he still could not reconcile it to himself to be absent from a scene which be now felt certain had been produced by bis own im prudence, so he went on with the crowd, endeavouring as he did so, by every argu ment that could be suggested to him, to induce tbem to abstain from the acts of violence they contemplated. He had a hope, too, that when they reached Sir Francis Varney's, finding him not within, as probably would be the case, as by that time he would have started to meet Henry Bannerworth on the ground, to fight the duel, he might induce the mob to return, and forego their meditated violence. And thus was it that, urged on by a multitude of persons, the unhappy sur geon was expiating, both in mind and person, the serious mistake be had com mitted in trusting a secret to his wife. Let it not be supposed that we for one moment wish to lay down a general prin ciple as regards the confiding secrets to ladies, because from the beginning of the world it has become notorious how well they keep them, and with what admirable discretion, tact, and forethought, this fairest portion of humanity conduct them selves. We know how few Mrs. Chillingworths there are in the world, and have but to regret that our friend the doctor should, in his matrimonial adventure, have met with such a specimen. another loud shout"], [195, "THE FEAST OF BLOOD. 185 there had been tales told of snch midnight visitants, so that Mrs. ChiUingwortb, when she had imparted the information which she had obtained, had already some rough material to work upon in the minds of her auditors, and, therefore, there was no great difficulty in very soon estabUshing the fact.

THE POPULAR E.IOT.\u2014 SIR FEANCIS VAR- NEY'S DANGEE.\u2014 THE SUGGESTION AND ITS BESULTS. uch, then, were tbe circum- stances which at once alter- ed the whole aspect of the affairs, and, from private and domestic causes of very deep annoy- ance, led to public resnlts Under such circumstances, ignorant people always do what they have heard has been done by some one else before them, and in an incredibly short space of time the propriety of catching Sir Francis Varney, depriving him of his vampyre-like existence, and driving a stake through his body, became not at all a questionable proposition. Alas, poor Mr. Chillingworth ! as well might he have attempted King Cannte's task of stemming the waves of the ocean, as that of attempting to stop the crowd from prooeeding to Sir Francis Varney's house of a character which seemed likely to in volve the whole country side m the greatest possible confusion. But while we blama Mr. Chillingworth for being so indiscreet as to communicate the secret of such a person as Varney the vampyre to his wife, we trust in a short time to be enabled to show that he made as much reparation as it was possible to make for the mischief he had unintention ally committed. And now as he struggled onward\u2014 apparently onward \u2014 first and foremost among the rioters, he was really doing all in his power to quell that tumult which.snperstition and dread had raised. Human nature truly delights in the mar vellous, and in proportion as a knowledge of the natural phenomena of nature is re stricted, and unbridled indignation allowed to give the rein to fathomless conjecture, we shall find an eagerness likewise to be- Ueve the marvellous to be the truth. His very presence was a sort of confir mation of the whole affair. In vain ho gesticulated, in vain he begged and prayed that they would go back, and in vain he declared that full and ample justice should be done upon the vampyre, provided popular clamour spared him, and he was left to more deliberate judgment Those who were foremost in the throng paid no attention to these remonstrances, while those who were more distant heard them not, and, for aU they knew, he might be urging the crowd on to violence, instead of deprecating it Thus, then, this disorderly rabble rout reached tbe house of Sir Francis Varney, and loudly demanded of his terrified ser vants where he was to be found. The knocking at the hall-door was pro digious, and, with a laudable desire, doubt less, of saving time, the moment one was done amusing himself with the ponderous knocker, another seized it; so that until the door was flung open by some of the bewildered and terrified men, there was no cessation whatever of the furious de mand for admittance. That dim and uncertain condition con cerning vampyres, originating probably as it had done in Germany, had spread itself slowly, but insidiously, throughout the whole of the civilized world. In no country and in no clime is there not something which bears a kind of family relationship to tho veritable vampyre of which Sir Francis Varney appeared to be so choice a specimen. The yhoul of eastern nations is but the same being, altered to suit habits and loca lities; and the sema of the Scandinavians is but the vampyre of a more primitive race, and a personification of that morbid imagination which has once fancied the probability of the dead walking again among the living, with all the frightful insignia of corruption and the grave about them. \" Varney the vampyre \u2014 Varney the vampyre !\" cried a hundred voices. \"Death to the vampyre ! Where is he? Bring him out. Varney the vampyre !\" The servants were too terrified to speak for some moments, as they saw such a tumultuous assemblage seeking their mas ter, while so singular a name was applied to him. At length, one more bold than the rest contrived to stammer out \u2014 \" My good poople, Sir Francis Varney is not at home. He took an early breakfast, and has been out nearly an hour.\" Although not popular in England, still"], [196, "VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE ; OR, 186 The mob paused a moment in indeci sion, and then one ot the foremost cried, \u2014 \" Who'd suppose they'd own he was at home ! He's hiding somewhere, of course; let's pull him out.\" \"Ab, pull him out \u2014 pull him out !\" cried many voices. A rush was made into the house, aud in a very few minutes its cham bers were ransacked, and all its hidden places carefully searched, with the hope of discovering the bidden form ot Sir Francis Varney. The servants felt that, with their ineffi cient strength, to oppose the proceedings of an assemblage which seemed to be un checked by all sort of law or reason, wonld be madness ; they therefore only looked on, with wonder and dismay, satisfied certainly in their own minds that Sir Francis would not be found, and indulging in much con jecture as to what would be the result of such violent and unexpected proceedings. Mr. ChiUingworth hoped that time was being gained, and that some sort of indica tion of what was going on would reach the unhappy object of popular detestation sufficiently early to enable him to provide for his own safety. He knew he was breaking his own en gagement to be present at the duel between Henry Bannerworth and Sir Francis Var ney, and, as that thought recurred to him, he dreaded that his professional services might be required on one side or tbe other; for he knew, or fancied he knew, that mutual hatred dictated the contest; and he thought that if ever a duel bad taken place which was likely to be attended with some disastrons result, that was snrely the one. But how could he leave, watched and surrounded as he was by an infuriated multitude \u2014 how could he hope but that his footsteps would be dogged, or that the slightest attempt of his to convey a warn ing to Sir Francis Varney would not be the means of bringing down upon his head the very danger he sought to shield him from? obey any impulse, and this perfectly groundless supposition was sufficient to turn their steps back again in the direction whence they came, and they had actually, in a straggling sort of column, reached half-way towards the town, when they en countered a boy, whose professional pur suit consisted in tending sheep very early of a morning, and who at once informed them that he had seen Sir Francis Varney in the wood, half-way between Banner worth Hall and his own home. This event at once turned the whole tide again, and with renewed clamours, carrying Mr. Chillingworth along with them, they now rapidly neared the real spot, where, probably, had they turned a Uttle earlier, they would have viewed the object of their suspicion and hatred. But as we have already recorded, the advancing throng was seen by the parties on the ground, where the duel could scarcely bave been said to have been fought; and then had Sir Francis Varney dashed into the wood, which was so op portunely at hand to afford him a shelter from his enemies, and from the intricacies of which \u2014 well acquainted with them as he doubtless was \u2014 he had every chance of eluding their pursuit. The whole affair was a great surprise to Henry aud his friends, when they saw such a string of people advancing, with such shouts and imprecations ; they could not, for the life of them, imagine what could have excited such a turn out among the ordinarily industrious and quiet inhabitants of a town, remarkable rather for the quietude and steadiness of its population, than for any violent outbreaks of popular feeling. \"What can Mr. Chillingworth be about\" said Henry, \"to bring such a mob here? Has he taken leave of his senses?\" \"Nay,\" said Marchdale, \"look again; he seems to be trying to keep them back, although ineffectually, for they wUl not be stayed.\" \" D e,\" said the admiral, \" here's a gang of pirates ; we shall be boarded and carried before we know where we are, Jack.\" In this state of uncertainty, then, did our medical man remain, a prey to the bitterest reflections, and fuU of the direst apprehensions, without having the slightest power of himself to alter so disastrous a train of circumstances. \" Ay, ay, sir,\" said Jack. \"And is that all you've got to say, you lubber, when you see your admiral iu danger? You'd better go and make terms with the enemy at once.\" \"Really, this is serious,\" said Henry; \"they shout for Varney. Can Mi. Cail lingworth have been so mad as to adopt this means of stopping the duel?\" \" Impossible,\" said Marchdale; \" if that had been his intention, he could have done Dissatisfied with their non-success, the crowd twice searched the house of Sir Francis Varney, from the attics to the basement; and then, and not till then, did they begin reluctantly to believe that the servants must have spoken the truth. \" He's in the town somewhere,\" cried one. \" Let's go back to the town.\" It is strange how suddenly any mob wdl"], [197, "TIIE FEAST OF BLOOD. 187 so quietly, through the medium ofthe civil authorities.\" \"Hang me!\" exclaimed the admiral, \"if these are any civil authorities; they talk of smashing somebody.

Of private wrong I can accuse him ; bnt I desire no crowd to take up my cause, or to avenge my quarrels.\" \" Mr. Bannerworth, it has become known, through my indiscretion, that Sir Francis Varney is suspected of being a vampyre.\" \" Is this so?\" \" A little deaf, I say.\" \"Why, you lubberly lying swab, how dare you say so?\" \" Because you was.\" \"You slave-going scoundrel!\" \" For Heaven's sake, do not quarrel at such a time as this!\" said Henry; \" we shaU be surrounded in a moment. Come, Mr. Marchdale, let you andi visit these people, and ascertain what it is that has so much excited their indignation.\" \" Hurrah !\" shouted the mob. \" Down with the vampyre! hurrah! where is he? Down with him !\" \"Drive a stake through him,\" said a woman ; \" it's the only way, and the hu manestest. You've only to take a hedge stake, and sharpen it a bit at one end, and char it a Uttle in tbe fire so as there mayn't be no splinters to hurt, and then poke it through his stomach.\" The mob gave a great shout at this hu mane piece of advice, and it was some time before Henry could make himself heard at aU, even to those who were nearest to him. \"Agreed,\" said Marchdale; and they both stepped forward at a rapid pace, to meet the advancing throng. The crowd, which had now approached to within a short distance of the expectant little party, was of a most motley descrip- tion, and its appearance, under many cir- cumstances, would cause considerable risi- bility. Men and women were mixed indiscriminately together, and in the shout- ing, the latter, if such a thing were possible, exceeded the former, both in discordance and energy. Every individual composing that mob carried some weapon calculated for defence, such as flails, scythes, sickles, bludgeons, &c, and this mode of arming caused them to wear a most formidable appearance; while the passion that superstition had called up was strongly depicted in their inflamed features. Their fury, too, had been excited by their disappointment, and it was with concentrated rage that they now pressed onward. . The calm and steady advance of Henry and Mr. Marchdale to meet the advancing throng, seemed to have the effect of retard- ing their progress a Uttle, and they came to a parley at a hedge, which separated them from the meadow in which the duel had been fought. \"You seem to be advancing towards us,\" said Henry. \" Do you seek me or any of my friends; and if so, upon what errand? Mr. ChilUngworth, for Heaven's sake, explain what is the cause of aU this tumult. You seem to be at the head of it\" \" Seem to be,\" said Mr. Chillingworth, \" without being so. You are not sought, nor any of your friends.\" \" Who, then?\" \" Sir Francis Varney,\" was the immedi \u00bbte reply. \"When he did succeed in so doing, he cried, with a loud voice, \u2014 \" Hear me, all of you. It is quite need less for me to inquire how you became possessed of the information that a dread ful suspicion hangs over the person of Sir Francis Varney ; but if, in consequence of hearing such news, you fancy this public demonstration wiU be agreeable to me, or likely to reUeve those who are nearest or dearest to me from the state of misery and apprehension into which they have fiiUen, you are much mistaken.\" \" Hear him, hear him !\" cried Mr. Marchdale ; \" he speaks both wisdom and truth.\" \" If anything,\" pursued Henry, \" could add to the annoyance of vexation and misery we have suffered, it would assuredly be the being made subjects of every-day gossip, and every-day clamour.\" \"You hear him?\" eaid Mr. Marchdale. \"Yes, we does,\" said a man; \"but we comes out to catch a vampyre for all that.\" \" Oh, to be sure,\" said the humane woman ; \" nobody's feehngs is nothing to us. Are we to be woke up in the night with vampyres sucking our bloods while we've got a stake in the country?\" \" Hurrah !\" shouted everybody. \" Down with the vampyre ! where is he?\" \" You are wrong. I assure you you are all wrong,\" 6aid Mr. ChUlingwortb, imploringly; \" there is no vampyre here, you see. Sir Francis Varney has not only escaped, but he wUl take the law of all of you.\""], [198, "VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE ; OR, 188 This was an argument which appeared to stagger a few, but the bolder spirits pushed them on, and a suggestion to search the wood having been made by some one who was more cunning than his neigh bours, that measure was at once proceeded with, and executed in a systematic manner, which made those who knew it to be the hiding-place of Sir Francis Varney tremble sor his safety. It was with a strange mixture of feeling that Henry Bannerworth waited the result of the search for the man wbo but a few minutes before had been opposed to him in a contest of life or death. \" Bear a hand, Jack,\" said tho admiral; \"we'll have a fight for it yet; they shan't murder even a vampyre in cold blood. Load the pistols and send a flying shot or two among the rascals, the moment they appear.\" \"No, no,\" said Henry; \"no more vio lence, at least ; there has been enough there has been enough.\" Even as he spoke there came rushing from among the trees at the corner of the wood the figure of a man. There needed but one glance to assure them who it was. Sir Francis Varney had been seen, and was flying before those implacable foes who had sought his life. He had divested himself of his huge cloak, as well as of his low slouched hat, and, with a speed which nothing but the most absolute desperation could have enabled him to exert, he rushed onward, beating down before him every obstacle, and bounding over the meadows at a rate that, if he could have continued it for any length of time, would have set pursuit at defiance. \"Bravo!\" 6houtedthe admiral, \"astern chase is a long chase, and I wish them joy 0t jt. D e, Jack, did you ever see anybody get along like that?\" \" Ay, ay, sir.\" \" You never did, you scoundrel.\" \u00ab Yes, I did.\" \"When and where?\" \" YV hen you ran away off the sound.\" The admiral turned nearly blue with anger, but Jack looked perfectly imper- turbable, as he added \u2014 \" You know you ran away after the French frigates who wouldn't stay to fight you.\" \" Ah ! that indeed. There he goes, putting on efery stitch of canvas, I'U be bound.\" The destruction of Sir Francis Varney would certainly have been an effectual means of preventing him from continuing to be the incubus he then was upon the Bannerworth family ; and yet the gene rous nature of Henry shrank with horror from seeing even such a creature as Var ney sacrificed at tbe shrine of popular resentment, and murdered by an infuriated populace. He felt as great an interest in the escape of the vampyre as if some great advantage to himself had been contingent upou such an event; and, although he spoke not a word, while the echoes of the little wood were aU awakened by the clamorous man ner in which the mob searched for their victim, bis feelings could be well read upon his countenance. Tha admiral, too, without possessing probably the fine feeUngs of Henry Ban nerworth, took an unusually sympathetic interest in the fate of the vampyre ; and, after placing himself in various attitudes of intense excitement he exclaimed \u2014 \" D \u2014 n it, Jack, I do hope, after all, the vampyre will get the better of them. It's like a whole flotilla attacking one vessel \u2014 a lubberly proceeding at the best, and I'll be hanged if I like it. I should like to pour in a broadside into those fellows, just to let them see it wasn't a proper .English mode of fighting. Shouldn't you, Jack?\" \" And there they come,\" said Jack, as he pointed to the corner of the wood, and some of the more active of the vampyre's . pursuer's showed themselves. It would appear as if the vampyre had been started from some hiding-place in the interior of the wood, and had then thought it expedient altogether to leave that retreat, and make his way to some more secure one across the open country, where there would be more obstacles to his discovery than perseverance could i overcome. Probably, then, among the i brushwood and trees, for a few moments I he had been again lost sight of, until those who were closest upon his track had emerged from among the dense foliage, and saw bim scouting across the country at such headlong speed. These were but \" Ay, ay, sir, I should.\" \"Shiver me, if I see an opportunity, if I don't let some of those rascals know what's what.\" Scarcely had these words escaped the Ups of the old admiral, than there arose a laud shout from the interior of the wood. It -.vas a shout of success, and seemed at the very least to herald the capture of the unfortunate Varney. \"By Heaven!\" exclaimed Henry, \"they have got him.\" '\u2022 God forbid !\" said Mr. Marchdale ; \" this grows too serious.\""], [199, "THE FEAST OF BLOOD. 189 few, and in their extreme anxiety them selves to capture Varney, whose precipi tate and terrified flight brought a firm conviction to their minds of his being a vampyre, they did not stop to get much of a reinforcement, but plunged on like greyhounds in his track. \"Jack,\" said the admiral, \"this won't do. Look at that great lubberly feUow with the queer smock-frock.\" \" Never saw such a figure-head in my life,\" said Jack, \" Stop him.\" \" Ay, ay, sir.\" The man was coming on at a prodigious rate, and Jack, with all the deliberation in the world, advanced to meet him ; and when they got sufficiently close together that in a few moments they must encounter each other, Jack made himself into as small a bundle as possible, and presented his shoulder to the a'dvancing countryman in such a way, that he flew off it at a tan gent, as if he had run against a brick waU, and after rolling head over heels for some distance, safely deposited himself in a ditch, where he disappeared com pletely for a few moments from aU haman observation. \"Well, it is odd to me, as some people can't go a fishing without getting out of temper. Have it your own way; I won't interfere with you;\" and away Jack walked. The man cleared the mud ont of his eyes, as well as he could, and looked after him with a powerful suspicion that in Jack he saw the very cause of his mortal mis- hap; but, somehow or other, his immersion in the not over limpid stream had wonder- fully cooled his courage, and casting one despairing look upon his begrimed apparel, and another at the last of the stragglers who were pursuing Sir Francis Varney across the fields, he thought it prudent to get home as fast as he could, and get rid of the disagreeable results of an adventure which had turned out for him anything but auspicious or pleasant. Mr. ChiUingworth, as though by a sort of impulse to be present in case Sir Francis Varney should really be run down, and with a hope of saving him from personal violence, had followed the foremost of the rioters in the wood, found it now quite impossible for bim to carry on such a chase as that which was being undertaken across the fields after Sir Francis Varney. His person was unfortunately but ill qualified for the continuance of such a pursuit, and, although with the greatest reluctance, he at last felt himself com- pelled to give it up. In making his way through the intrica- cies of the wood, he had been seriously in- commoded by the tMck undergrowth, and he had accidentally encounted several miry pools, with which he had involun- tarily made a closer acquaintance than was at all conducive either to his personal appearance or comfort. The doctor's temper, though, generally speaking, one of the most even, was at last affected by his mishaps, and he could not restrain from an execration upon his want of prudence in letting his wife have a knowledge of a se- cret that was not his own, and the pro ducing an unlooked-for circumstance, the termination of which might be of a most disastrous nature. \"Don't say I hit yon,\" said Jack. \" Curse yer, what did yer run against me for? Sarves you right. Lubbers as don't know how to steer, in course runs agin things.\" \"Bravo,\" said the admiral; \"there's another of them.\" The pursuers of Varney the Vampyre, however, now came too thick and fast to be -so easUy disposed of, and as soon as his figure conld be seen coursing over the meadows, and springing over road and ditch with an agiUty almost frightful to look upon, the whole rabble rout was in pursuit of him. By this time, the man who had fallen into the ditch had succeeded in making his ap- pearance in the visible world again, and as he crawled up the bank, looking a thing of mire and mud, Jack walked up to him with aU the carelessness in the world, and said to him \u2014 \" Any lack, old chap?\" \"Oh, murder !\" said the man; \"what do you mean? \u2014 who are yon?\u2014 where am I?\u2014 what's the matter? Old Muster Fowler, the fat owner, wiU set \u00abpon me now.\" \"Have yon caught anything?\" said Jack. Tired, therefore, and nearly exhausted by the exertions he had already taken, he emerged now alone from the wnod, and near tho spot where stood Henry Banner worth and his friends in consultation. The jaded look of the surgeon was quite sufficient indication of the trouble and tur moU he had gone through, and some ex pressions of sympathy for his condition were dropped by Henry, to whom he re pUed,\u2014 \" Nay, my young friend, I deserve tt all, \" Caught anything?\" \"Yes ; you've been in for eels, haven't you?\" \"D nt\""], [200, "VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE. 190 I have nothing but my own indiscretion to thank for all the turmoil and tumult that has arisen this morning.\" His friends needed no further urging, but at a brisk pace they all proceeded by the nearest footpaths towards the town. It puzzled his pursuers to think in what possible direction Sir Francis Varney ex pected to find sustenance or succour, wheu they saw how curiously he took his flight across the meadows. Instead of endea vouring, by any circuitous path, to seek the shelter of his own house, or to throw himself upon the care of the authorities of the town, who must, to the extent iu their power, have protected him, he struck across the fields, apparently without aim or purpose, seemingly intent upon nothing but to distance his pursuers in a long chase, which might possibly tire them or it might noi, according to his or their power of endurance. We say this seemed to be the case, but it was not so in reality. Sir Francis Varney had a deeper purpose, and it was scarcely to be supposed that a man of his subtle genius, and, apparently, far-seeing and reflecting intellect, could so far have overlooked the many dangers of his posi tion as not to be fully prepared for some such contingency as that which had just now occurred. \" Bat to what possible cause can we at tribute such an outrage ?\" \" Reproach me as much as you wUl, I deserve it A man may prate of his own secrets if he like, but he shonld be careful of those of other people. I trusted yours to another; and am properly punished.\" \"Enough,\" said Henry; \"we'll say no more of that, Mr. Chillingworth. What is done cannot be undone, and we had better spend our time in reflection of how to make the best of what is, than in useless lamentation over its causes. What is to be done?\" \" Nay, I know not. nave you fought the duel ?\" \" Yes ; and, as you perceive, harm lessly.\" \" Thank Heaven for that.\" \" Nay, I had my fire, which Sir Francis refused to return ; so the affair had just ended when the sound of ap proaching tumult came upon our ears.\" \"What a strange mixture,\" exclaimed Marchdale, \" of feelings and passions this Varney appears to be. At one moment acting with the greatest apparent ma lignity ; and another, seeming to have awakened in his mind a romantic gene rosity which knows no bounds. I cannot understand him.\" Holding, as he did, such a strange place iu society \u2014 living among men, and yet possessing so few attributes in common with humanity \u2014 ho must all along have felt tho possibility of drawing upon him self popular violence. He could not wholly rely upon tho secrecy of the Bannerworth family, much as they might well be supposed to shrink from giving publicity to the circumstances of so fearfully strange and perilous a na ture as those which had occurred amongst them. The merest accident might at any moment make him the town's talk. The overhearing of a few chance words by some gossiping domestic \u2014 some ebullition of anger or annoyance by some member of the family \u2014 or a communication of some friend who had been treated with confi dence \u2014 might, at any time, awaken around him some such a storm as that which now raged at his heels. \" Nor I, indeed,\" said Henry ; \" but yet I somehow tremble for his fate, and I seem to feel that something ought to be done to save him from the fearful consequences of popular feeling. Let us hasten to the town, and procure what assistance we may : but few persons, well organized and properly armed, will achieve wonders against a desultory and ill-appointed mul titude. There mav be a chance of saving him yet from the imminent danger which surrounds him.\" \"That's proper.\" cried the admiral. \" I don't like to see any one run down. A fair fight's another thing. Yard arm and yard arm\u2014 stink pots and pipkins \u2014 hroadside to broadside \u2014 and throw ia your bodies, if you like, on the lee quarter ; but don't do anything shabby. What do you think of it, Jack?\" \"Why, I means to say as how if Var ney only keeps on sail as he's been doing, that the devil himself wouldn't catch him in a gale.\" \" And yet\" said Henry, \" it is our duty to do the best 'we can. Let us at once to the town, and summon all the assistance in our power. Come on \u2014 come on 1\" Varney the Vampire must have calcu lated this. He must have felt the impossi bility of such a state of things ; and, as a matter of course, politicly provided him self with some place of refuge. After about twenty minutes of hard chasing across the fields, there could be no doubt of his intentions. He had sucb a place of refuge ; and, strange a one as it might appear, he sped towards it in as direct a line as ever a well-sped arrow flew towards its mark."], [201, "VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE; OR, THE FEAST OF BLOOD. 183 THE STRUGGLE BF.TWKEN VARNEY AND CHARLES HOLLAND. That place of refuge, to the surprise of . every one, appeared to be the ancient ruin, of which we have before spoken, and which was so well known to every inhabi- I tant of the county. Tmly, it seemed like some act of mere desperation for Sir Francis Varney to hope | there to hide himself. There remained within, of what had once been a stately pile, but a few grey crumbling walls, which the hunted hare would have passed unheeded, knowing that not for one instant could he have baffled his pursuers by seeking so inefficient a refuge. And those who followed hard and fast upon the track of Sir Francis Varney felt so sure of their game, when they saw whither he was speeding, that they relaxed in their haste considerably, calling loudly to each other tbat the vampyre was caught at last, for he could be easily surrounded among the old rnins, and dragged from among its moss-grown walls. In another moment, with a wild dash and a cry of exultation, he sprang out of sight, behind an angle, formed by what had been atone time one of the principal supports of tbe ancient structure.

It was astonishing how the fact of not finding him iu a moment, again roused all their angry feelings ag unst him, and dispelled every leeling of superstitious awe With which he had been surrounded ; There was a pause of several minutes. Those who bad come the fleetest were gathering breath, and tho-e who had come up last were looking to their more forward Companions tor some information as to what had occurred before their arrival. All was profoundly still within the ruin, and then suddenly, as if by comm n con sent, there Arose lrom every throat a loud shout of rage gave place to the sort of shuddering horor with which they had before cou t mplated his immediate estruction, when they ha believed him to be virtua ly wituia iheir very tira-p.

Then it would have been a strange sight for an indifferent spectator to have seen how they shrunk, one by one, out of thc shadow of those ruins ; each see i ing to be afraid that the vampyre, in some mysterious manner, would catch him if he harpened to be the last within their sombre influence ; and when t rey bad all collected iu the bright open space, seme little distance beyond, they looked at each other and at the ruins, with du- bious expressions of countenance, each, no doubt, wishing that each would suggest something of a consolatory or practicable character. \" What's u be done now?\" said one. \" Down with tbe vampyre ! down with the vampyre 1\" The echoes of that shout died away, and then all was stiil as before, while a super stitious feeling crept over even the boldest. It w uld almost seem as if they had ex pected some kind of response lrom Sir Francis Varney to the shout of defiance with which they bad just greeted him ; but the very calmness, lepose, and abso lute quiet of the ruin and all about it alarmed them, and thev looked the one at the other as if the adventure after all were not one of the pleasaniest description, and might not faU out so happily as they had expected.

She bad seen the peasantry forsaking I their work in the fields and gardens, and apparently intent upon some object of absorbing interest ; but she feared to leave the house, for she had promised Henry that she would not do so, lest the former pacific conduct of the vampyre should have been but a new snare, for the purpose of drawing her so far from her home as to lead her into some danger when she should be far from assistance. And yet more than once was she tempted to forget her promise, and to seek the open country, for fear that those 6he loved should be encountering some danger for her sake, which sbe would williDgly either share with them or spare them. The soUcitation, however, of her brother kept her comparatively quiet ; and, more- over, since her last interview with Varney, in which, at all events, he had shown some feeling for tbe melancholy situation to which he had reduced her, she had been more able to reason calmly, and to meet the suggestions of passion and of impulse with a sober judgment. About midday, then, she saw the do- mestic party returning \u2014 that party, whicb now consisted of her two brothers, the admiral, Jack Pringle, and Mr. ChiUing- worth. As for Mr. Marchdale, he had given them a polite adieu on the confines of the grounds of Bannerworth Hall, stating, that, although he had felt it to be his duty to come forward and second Henry Bannerworth in the duel with tbe vampyre, yet that circumstance by no means obliterated from his memory the insults he had received from Admiral Bell, and, therefore, be decUned going to Ban- nerworth Hall, and bade them a very good morning.

This answer, of course, produced the usual contention, which lasted them until they got fairly in the house, where they swore at each other to an extent that was enough to make any one's bair stand on end, until Henry and Mr. ChUUngworth interfered, and really begged that they would postpone tbe discussion until Some j more fitting opportunity. in hurried accents the names of some who are dear to him, and far away \u2014 some wbo may, perchance, be mourning him, but who know not, guess not, aught of his present sufferings.

The sound reaches his own ears, and for a few moments, in the deep impatience of his wounded spirit, he heaps maledictions on the beads of those who have reduced bim to bis present state. But 60on a better nature seems to come over him, and gentler words fall from his lips. He preaches patience to himself \u2014 he talks not of revenge, but of justice, and in accents of more hopefulness than he had before spoken, he calls upon Heaven to succour him in bis deep distress. Then all is still, and the prisoner appears to have resigned himself once more to the calmness of expectation or of despair ; but hark ! his sense of hearing, rendered doubly acute by lying so long alone in nearly darkness, aud in positive silence, detects sounds which, to ordinary mortal powers of perception, would have been by far too indistinct to produce any tangible effect upon the senses. It is the sound of feet \u2014 on, on they come ; far overhead he hears them ; they beat the green earth \u2014 that sweet, verdant sod, which he may never see again \u2014 with an impatient tread.

Her desire to leave Bannerworth HaU consequently became more and more in tense, and as the admiral really now con sidered himself the master of the house, they offered no amount of opposition to the subject, but merely said \u2014 \"My dear Flora, Admiral BeU shall decide in all these matters, now.

An idea like that which had lent so powerful an impulse to the popular mind, was one far easier to set going than to deprecate or extinguish. The very cir cumstances which had occurred to foil the excited mob in their pursuit ol Sir Francis Varney were of a nature to increase the popular superstition concerning him, and to make him and his acts appear in still more dreadful colours. \"It is an honourable mode.\" \" Of course it is.

Had he not sought refuge where no human being would think of seeking refuge, namely, in that old, dilapidated ruin, where, when \" That's just what I want to know. Oh, I have it now.

There are many ideas, however, which, like tbe first plunge into a cold batb, are rather uncomfortable for the moment ; but which, in a little time, we become so fami liarised with, tbat they become stripped of their disagreeable concomitants, aud ap pear quite pleasing and natural. So it was with this notion of exhuming the dead bodies of those townspeople who had recently died from what was called a decay of nature, and such other failures of vitality as bore not the tangible name of any understood disease. From mouth to mouth the awful sugges tion spread like wUdfire, until at last it grew into such a shape that it almost seemed to become a duty, at all events, to have up Miles the butcher, and see bow he looked. These tales flew from mouth to month, and all listened to them with such an eager interest, that none thought it worth while to challenge their inconsistencies, or to ex press a doubt of their truth, because they bad not been mentioned before. The only individual, and he was a re markably clever man, who made the slightest remark upon tbe subject of a practical character, hazarded a suggestion that made confusion worse confounded. He knew something of vampyres. He bad travelled abroad, and bad beard of them in Germany, as well as in the east, and, to a crowd of wondering and aghast Usteners, he said \u2014 \" You may depend npon it, my friends, this has been going on some time : there has been several mysterious and sudden deaths io the town lately ; people have wasted away and died nobody knew how or wherefore.\" \" Yes\u2014 yea,\" said everybody. \" There was Miles the butcher ; you know how fat he was, and then how fat he wasn't.\" There is, too, about human nature, a natural craving curiosity concerning every thing connected with the dead. There is not a man of education or of intellectual endowment who would not travel many miles to look upon the exhumation of the remains of some one famous in his time, whether for his vices, bis virtues, his know ledge, his talents, or his heroism ; and if this feeling exists in the minds of the edu cated and refined in a sublimated shape, which lends to it grace and dignity, we may look for it among the vulgar and the ignorant, taking only a grosser and meaner form, in accordance with their habita of thought. The rude materials, of which the highest and noblest eelings of educated minds are formed, will be found amongst the most grovelling and base ; and so this Vulgar curiosity, which, combined with other feelings, prompted an ignorant and illiterate mob to exhume Miles, the once fat butcher, in a different form tempted the philosophic Hamlet to moralize upou the skull ot Yorick. A general assent was given to the pro position ; and then, elevating one arm in an oratical manner, the clever fellow con tinued \u2014 \" I have not a doubt that Miles, the butcher, and every one else wbo has died suddenly lately, have been victims of the vampyre ; and what's more, they'U all be 1 vampyres, and comeandsuckotter people's blood, till at last the whole town will be a town of vampyres.\" \"But what's to be done?\" cried one, who trembled so excessively that be could scarcely stand under his apprehension. \"There is but one plan \u2014 Sir Francis Varney must be found, and put out of the world in such a manner that he can't come back to it again ; and all those wbo are dead that ne have any suspicion of, should be taken up out of their graves and looked at, to see if they're rotting or not ; if they are it's all right ; but, if they look fresh snd much as usual, you may depend they're vampyres, and no mistake.\" This was a terrific suggestion thrown amongst a mob. To have caught.

But now those gates were closed, and for once were doing duty. Heaven only knows how they had been moved npon their rusty and time-worn hinges. The mob, however, was checked for the mo ment and it was clear tbat the ecclesias tical authorities were resolved to attempt something to prevent the desecration of the tombs. As they proceeded towards the grave yard, they amused themselves by breaking the windows of the tax-gatherers, and doing what passing mischief they could to the habitations of all who held any official situation or authority. This was something Uke a proclamation of war against those who might think it their duty to interfere with the lawless pro ceedings of an ignorant multitude. A public-house or two, likewise, en route, was sacked of some of its inebriating con tents, so that, what with the madness of intoxication, and tbe general excitement consequent upon the very nature ot the business which took them to the church yard, a more wild and infuriated multitude than that which paused at two iron gates which led into tbe sanctuary of that church could not be imagined. Those who have never seen a mob placed in such a situation as to have cast off all moral restraint whatever, at the same time that it feels there is no physical power to cope with it, can form no notion of the mass of terrible passions which lie slumbering under what, in ordinary cases, have appeared harmless bosoms, but which now run riot, and overcame every princi ple of restraint. It is a melancholy fact, but, nevertheless, a fact, despite its melan choly, that, even in a civilised country like this, with a generally well-educated population, nothing but a weU-organised physical force keeps down, from the com mission of the most outrageous offences, hundreds and thousands of persons. We have said that the mob paused at the iron gates of the churchyard, but it was more a pause of surprise than one of vacillation, because they saw that those iron gates were closed, which had not been the case within the memory of tbe oldest among them. At the first building of the church, and the enclosure of its graveyard, two pairs of these massive gates had been presented by some munificent patron ; but, after a time, they hung idly upon their hinges, ornamental certainly, but useless, while a couple of turnstiles, to keep cattle from Straying within the sacred precincts, did duty instead, and established, without Those gates were sufficiently strong to resist the first vigorous shake which was given to them by some of the foremost among the crowd, and then one fellow started the idea that they might be opened from tbe inside, and volunteered to clam ber over the wall to do so. Hoisted np upon the shoulders of several, he grasped the top of the wall, and raised his head above its level, and then s- me shing of a mysterious nature rose up from the inside, aud dealt him such a whack between the eyes, that down he went sprawling among his coadjutors. Now, nobody had seen how this injury had been inflicted, and the policy of those in the garrison should have been certainly to keep up the mystery, and leave the in vaders in ignorance of what sort of person it was that had so soiled them. Man, however, is prone to indulge in vain glori fication, and the secret was exploded by the triumphant waving of the long staff of the beadle, with the gilt knob at the end of it, just over the parapet of the wall, in token of victory. \"It's Waggles! it's Waggles !\" cried everybody ; \"it's Waggles, the beadle !\" \" Yes,\" said a voice from within, \" it's Waggles, the beadle ; and he thinks as ha had yer there rather; try it again. The church isn't in danger ; oh, no. What do you think of this ?\" The staft\" was flourished more vigorously than ever, and in the secure position that Waggles occupied it seemed not only im possible to attack him, but that he pos sessed wonderful powers of resistance, for the staff was long and the knob was heavy. It was a boy who hit upon the ingenious expedient of throwing up a great stone, so that it just fell inside the wall, and hit Waggles a great blow on the head. Tne staff was flourished more vigorously than ever, and the mob, in the ecstasy at the fun which was going on, almost forgot the errand which had brought them. Perhaps after all the affair might have passed off jestingly, had not there been some really mischievous persons among the throng who were determined that sach"], [212, "VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE; OR, 202 should not be the case, and they incited the multitude to commence an attack upon the gates, which in a few moments must have produced their entire demolition. Suddenly, however, the boldest drew back, and there was a pause, as the well known form of the clergyman appeared advancing from the church-door, attired in full canonicals. turning, saw that the churchyard had been scaled at another place by some fifty or sixty persons, that his heart sunk within him, and he began to feel that what he had dreaded would surely come to pass. Even then he might have done some thing in the way of pacific exertion, but for the interference of Waggles, the beadle, who spoUt everything. \" There's Mr. Leigh,\" said several ; \"how unlucky he should be here.\" \u2022* What is this ?'' said the clergyman, approaching the gates. \"Can I believe my eyes when I see before me those who compose the worshippers of this church armed, and attempting to enter for the purpose of violence to this sacred place !

He saw the favourable effect they had produced, and anxious to follow it up, he added \u2014 CHAPTER XLV.

A kind of desperation seemed to have seized the beadle, and certainly, by his sudden and unexpected attack, he achieved wonders. When, however, a dozen hands got hold of the staff, and it was wrenched from him, and he was knocked down, and half-a-dozen people rolled over him, Waggles was not near the man he had been, and he would have been very well content to have lain quiet where he was ; this, however, he was not per mitted to do, for two or three, who had felt what a weighty instrument of warfare the parochial staff was, lifted him bodily from the ground, and canted him over the wall, without much regard to whether he fell on a hard or a soft place on the other side. \" Let this ebullition of seeling pass away, my friends ; and, believe me, when I assure you upon my sacred word, that whatever ground there may be for com plaint or subject for inquiry, shall be fully and fairly met ; and tbat the greatest exer tions shall be made to restore peace and tranquillity to all of you.\" \" It's all about the vampyre !\" cried one fellow. \" Mr, Leigh, how should you like a vampyiein the pulpit?\" \"Hush, hush ! can it be possible tbat you know so little of the works of that great Being whom you all pretend to adore, as to believe that he would create any class of beings of a nature such as you ascribe to that terrific word? Oh, let me pray of yon to get rid of these supersti tions \u2014 alike disgraceful to yourselves and afflicting to me.\" The clergyman had tbe satisfaction of seeing tbe crowd rapidly 'hinning from before the gates, and he believed his exhor tations were having all the effect he wished. It was not until he heard a loud shout behind him, and, upon hastily This feat accomplished, no further at tention was paid to Mr. Leigh, who, find ing that his exhortations were quite un heeded, retired into th\u00ab church with an appearance of deep affliction about him, and locked himself in the vestry.

Six or eight others, who had brought spades and pickaxes, now pushed forward to the work, and in an incredibly short space of time the grave of Miles, the fat butcher, seemed to be very nearly excavated. \" Silence !\" cried a loud voice, and every one obeyed the mandate, looking towards the speaker, who was a tall, gaunt-looking man, attired in a suit of faded-black, and who now pressed for ward to the front of the tnrong. \"Ob!\" cried one, \"it's Fletcher, the ranter. What does he do here?\" \" Hear him \u2014 hear him !\" cried others ; \"he won't 6top us.\" \" Yes, hear him I\" cried the tall man, waving his arms about like the sails of a windmill. \"Yes, hear bim!

Dig up Miles, the butcher !\" Work of any kind or nature whatever is speedily executed when done with a wish to get through it ; and never, per haps, within the memory of man, was a grave opened in that churchyard with such a wonderful celerity. The excite ment of the crowd grew intense\u2014 every available spot from whicb a view of the grave could be got was occupied ; for the last few minutes scarcely a remark had been uttered, and when, at last, the spade of one of those who wera dig ging 6truck upon something that sounded like wood, you might have heard a pin drop, and each one there present drew his breath more shortly than before. \"There he is,\" said the man whose spade struck upon the coffin. Those few words broke the spell, and there was a general murmur, while every individual present seemed to shift his posi tion in his anxiety to obtain a better view of what was about to ensue. \"Hear, hear, hear, hurra !\" said every body. \"Mr. Fletcher's not such a fool, after all. He means well.\" \" Yes, you sinners,\" said the ranter, \" and if you find Miles, the butcher, decaying\u2014 even as men are expected to decay whose mortal tabernacles are placed within the bowels of the earth \u2014 you shall gather from that a great omen, and a sign that if you follow me you seek the Lord ; but if you find him looking fresh and healthy, as if the warm blood was still in his veins, you shall take that likewise as a signification that what I say to you shall be as tbe Gospel, and that by coming to the chapel of the Little Boozlehum, ye shall achieve a great salvation.\" \" Very good,\" said a brawny fellow, advancing with a spade in his hand ; \" you get out of the way, and I'll soon have him up. Here goes, like blue blazes !\" The first shovelful of earth he took up he cast over bis head into the air, so tbat it fell in a shower among the mob, which of course raised a shout of indignation ; and, as he continued so to dispose of the superfluous earth, a general row seemed finely to ensue. Mr. Fletcher opened his mouth to make a remark, and, as that feature of his face was rather a capacious one, a descending lump ot mould, of a clayey consistency, fell into it, and got so The coffin now having been once found, there seemed to be an iucreased impetus given to the work, the earth was thrown out with a rapidity that seemed almost the quick result of the working of some machine ; and those closest to the grave's brink crouched down, and, impatient as they were upon the progress of events, heeded not the damp earth that fell upon them, nor the frail brittle and humid re mains of humanity that occasionally rolled to their feet. It was, indeed, a scene of intense ex citement \u2014 a scene which only wanted a few prominent features in its foreground ofa more intellectual and higher cast than composed the mob, to make it a fit theme for a painter of the highest talent. And now the last few shovelfuls of earth that hid the top of the coffin were cast from the grave, and that narrow house which contained the mortal remains of him who was so well known, while in life, to almost every one then present, was"], [214, "204 VARNRY, THE VAMPYRK; OR, i I, brought to the gaze of eyes whi'h never bad seemed likely to have looked upou him again. The cry was now for ropes, with which to raise the cumbrous mass ; but these were not to be had, no one had thought of pro viding himself with such appliances, so that by main strength only could the coffin be raised to the brink. The difficulty of doing this was im mense, for there was nothing tangible to stand upon ; and even when the mould from the sides was sufficiently cleared away that the handles of the coffin could be laid bold of, they came away immediately in the grasp of those who did so. his head be' ween the two who were talk- ing, \"if he is a vampyre, bow does he get out of his coffin at night with aU that weight of mould atop of him ?\" One ofthe men considered for a moment, and then finding no rational answer occur to him, he gave the boy a box on the ear, saying\u2014 \" I shonld like to know what business that is of yours ? Boys, now-a-days, ain't like the boys in my time ; they think nothing now of putting their spokes in grown-up people's whee s, just as if their opinions were of any consequence.\" Now, by a vigorous effort, those who were tugging at tbe ropes succeeded iu moving the coffin a little, and that first step was all the difficulty, for it was loosened from tbe soil in which it lay, and now came up wiih considerable facility. There was a half shout of satisfaction at this result, while some of the congrega- tion turned pa'e, and tremb'ed at the prospect of tbe sight which was about to present itself *, the coffin was dragged lrom the grave's brink fairly among the long rank grass that flourished in the church yard, and then they all looked at it sor a time, and the men who had been most earnest in raising it wiped the perspiration from their brows, and seemed to shrink from the task of opening that receptacle of the dead now that it was fairly in their power so to do. Each man looked anxiously in his neighbour's face, and several audibly won- dered why somebody else didn't open the coffin. But the more trouble that presented itself to the accomplishment of the designs of tbe mob, the more intent that body seemed upon carrying out to the full ex tent their original designs. Finding it quite impossible by bodily strength to raise the coffin of the butcher from the position in which it had got im bedded by excessive rains, a boy was hastily despatched to the village sor ropes, and never did boy run with such speed before, for aU his own curiosity was excited in the issue of an adventure, that to his young imagination was appallingly in teresting. As impatient as mobs usually are, they had not time, in this case, for the exercise of that quality of mind before the boy came back with the necessary means of exerting quite a different species of power against the butcher's coffin. Strong ropes were slid under the inert mass, and twenty hands at once pUed the task of raising that receptacle of the dead from what had been presumed to be its last resting-place. The ropes strained ind creaked, and many thought that they .vould burst asunder sooner than raise the aeavy coffin of the defunct butcher. It is sinular what reasons people find for backing their opinion. \"You may depend he's a vampyre,\" laid one, \"or it wouldn't be so dilficult to get him out of the grave.\" \"There's no harm in it\" said one; \"if he's a vampyre we onght to know it; and, if be ain't, we can't do any hurt to a dead man.\" \" Oughtn't we to have the service for the dead?\" said one. \"Yes,\" said the impertinent boy who had before received the knock on the head, \" I think we ought to have that read back wards.\" This ingenious idea was recompensed by a great many kicks and cutfs, which ought to have beeu sufficient to have warned him of the great danger of bei g a little before his age in wit. \" Where's the use o shirking the job ?\" cried he who had been so aciive in shovel ling the mud upon the multitude ; \"why, you cowardly sneaking set of humbugs, you're half afraid, now.\" \" Afraid \u2014 afraid !\" cried everybody ; \" who's afraid ?\" \"Oh, there can be no mistake about tbat ' said one ; \" when did a natural Christian's coffin stick in the mud in that \u25a0vay?\" \" Ab, to be sure,\" said another ; \" I (.new no good would come of his goings in ; he never was a decent sort of man ike his neighbours, and many queer hings have been said of him that I have io doubt are true enough, if we did but 'now the rights of them.\" \" Ah, but,\" said a young lad, thrusting \"Ah, who's arraid ?\" said a litile man, advancing, and assuming an heroic atti tude ; \"I always notice, if anybody's"], [215, "THE FEAST OF BLOOD. 205 J I afraid, it's some big feUow, with more bones than brains.\" relation of mine. Howsomdever, here goes. Who'd a thought that I should ever had a look at old fat and thunder again? \u2014 that's what I used to caU him ; and then he used to request me to go down below, where I needn't turn round to light my blessed pipe.\" \" Hell \u2014 we know,\" sa'd the boy ; \" why don't you open the lid, Dick ?\" \"I'm a going,\" said Dick ; \"kim up.\" He introduced the corner of a shovel between the lid and the coffin, and giving it a sudden wrench, he loosened it all down one side. At this moment, tbe man to whom this reproach was more particularly levelled raised a horrible shout ot terror, and cried out, in frantic accents \u2014 \"He's a-coming\u2014 he's a-coming !\" The little man fell at once into the grave, while the mob, with one accord, turned tail, and fled in all directions, leaving bim alone with tbe coffin. Such a fighting, and kicking, and scrambling ensued to get over the will of the grave-yard, tbat this great fellow, who had caused all the mis chief, burst into such peals of laughter that the majority of the people became aware that it was a joke, and came creeping back, looking as sheepish as possible. Some got up very faint sorts of laugh, and said \"very good,\" and swore they saw what big Dick meant from the first, and only ran to make the others run. \"Very good,\" said Dick, \"I'm glad you enjoyed it, that's all. My eye, what a scampering there was among you. Where's my little friend, who was so infernally cun ning about bones and brains ?\" With some difficulty the little man was extricated from the grave, and then, oh, for the consistency of a mob ! they all laughed at him ; those very people who, heedless of all the amenities of existence, had been trampling on each other, and roaring with terror, actually had the im pudence to laugh at him, and call him a cowardly little rascal, and say it served him right But such is popularity ! \"Well, if nobony won't open the coffin,\" said big D.ck, \" I will, so here goes. I knowed the old fellow when he was alive, and many a time be's d \u2014 d me and I've d\u2014 d him, so I ain't a-going to be afraid of him now he's dead. We was very in timate, you see, 'cos we was the two heaviest men in the parish ; there's a reason for everything.\" \" Ah, Dick's the fellow to do it,\" cried a number of persons; \"there's nobody Uke Dick for opening a coffin ; he's the man as don't care for nothing.\" \" Ab, you snivelling curs,\" said Dick, \"I hate you. If it warn't for my own Satisfaction, and all lor to prove that my old friend the butcher, as weighed seven teen stone, and stood six feet two and-a half on his own sole, I'd see you all jolly well \" A shudder pervaded the multitude, and, popularly speaking, you might have heard a pin drop in that crowded churchyard at that eventful moment. Dick then proceeded to the other side, and executed the same manoeuvre. \" Now for it,\" he said ; \" we shall see him in a moment, and we'U think we seed him still.\" \" What a lark !\" said tbe boy. \"You hold your jaw, will yer ? Who axed you for a remark, blow yer? What do you mean by squatting down there, like a cock-sparrow, with a pain in his tail, hanging your head, too, right over the coffin ? Did you never hear of what they call a sluvifium coming from the dead, yer ignorant beast, as is enough to send nobody to blazes in a minute ? Get out of the way of the cold meat, will yer ?\" \"A what, do you say, Dick.\" \"Request information from the extreme point of my elbow.\" Dick threw down the spade, and laying hold of the coffin-lid with both hands, he lifted it off, anu flung it on one side. There was a visible movement and an exclamation among the multitude. Some were pushed down, in the eager desire of those behind to obtain a sight of the gha-.tly remains of the butcher ; those at a distance were frantic, and the excitement was momentarily increasing. They might all have spared themselves the trouble, for the coffin was empty there was no dead butcher, nor any evi dence of one ever having been there, not even the grave-clothes ; the only thing at all in the receptacle of the dead was a brick. Dick's astonishment was so intense that his eyes and mouth kept opening together to such an extent, that it seemed doubtful when they would reach their extreme point of elongation. He ihen took up the brick and looked at it curiously, and turned it over and over, examined the ends and tbe sides with a critical eye, and at length he said\u2014 \" D d first,\" said the boy ; \" open the lid, Dick, let's have a look.\" \"Ah, you're a rum un,\" said Dick, \" arter my own heart. I sometimes thinks as you must be a nevey, or some sort of"], [216, "206 VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE. < \" Well, I'm blowed, here's a transmogri fication ; he's consolidified himself into a blessed brick \u2014 here's a curiosity.\" \" Bnt you don't mean to say that's the butcher, Dick ?\" said the boy. Dick reached over, and gave him a tap on the head with tbe brick. \" pull them all up ! Let's see how many vampyres there are in the churchyard.\" \"Well, it's no business of mine,\" said Dick ; \" but I wouldn't if I was you.\" \"You may depend,\" said one, \"that Dick knows something about it, or he wouldn't take it so easy.\" \" Ah ! down with him,\" said the man who had received the box on the ears ; \" he's perhaps a vampyre himself.\" The mob made a demonstration towards him, but Dick stood his ground, and they paused again. \"Now, you're a cowardly set,\" bo said; \"because you're disappointed you want to come upon me. Now, I'll just show what a little thing will frighten you all again ; and I warn beforehand it will, so you shan't say you didn't know it, and were taken by surprise.\" The mob looked at him, wondering what he was going to do. \" Once \u2014 twice \u2014 thrice !\" be said, and then he flung the brick up into the air an immense height, and shouted \"heads,\" in a loud tone. \" There !\" he said, \" that's what I calls occular demonstration. Do you believe it now, you blessed infidel ? What's more natural ? He was an out-and-out brick when he was alive ; and he's turned to a brick now he's dead.\" \" Give it to me, Dick,\" said the boy ; \" I should like to have that brick, just for the fun of the thing.\" \" I'll see you turned into a pantile first. I sha'n't part with this here, it looks so blessed sensible ; it's gaining on me every minute as a most remarkable Ukeness, d d if it ain't.\" By this time the bewilderment of the mob had subsided ; now that there was no dead butcher to look upon, they fancied themselves most grievously injured ; and, somehow or other, Dick, notwithstanding all his exertions in their service, was looked upon in the light of a showman, who had promised some startling exhibition and then had disappointed his auditors. The first intimation he had of popular vengeance was a stone thrown at him, but Dick's eye happened to be upon the fellow who threw it-, and collaring him in a mo- ment, he dealt him a cuff on the side of the head, which confused his faculties for a week. A general dispersion of the crowd en- sued, and the brick fell in the centre of a very large circle indeed. \" There you are again,\" said Dick ; \" why, what a nice set you are.\" \" What fun !\" said the boy. \" It's a famous coffin, this, Dick,\" and he laid himself down in the butcher's last resting- place. \" I never was ia a coffin before \u2014 it's snug enough.\" \"Ab, you're a rum 'un,\" said Dick ; \" you're such a inquiring genius, you is ; you'll get your head into some hole one day, and not be able to get it out again, and then I shall see you a kicking. Hush ! lay still \u2014 don't say anything.\" \" Good again,\" said the boy ; \" wha*; shall I do?\" \"Hark ye,\" be then cried, with a loud voice, \" don't interefere, with me ; you know it won't go down. There's some thing wrong here ; and, as one of your selves, I'm as much interested in finding out what it is as any of you can possibly be. There seems to be some truth iu this vampyre business ; our old friend, tho butcher, you see, is not in his grave ; where is he then ?\" \" Give a sort of a howl and a squeak, when they've all come back again.\" \" Won't I !'' said the boy; \" pop on the lid.\" The mob looked at each other, and not one among them attempted to answer. the question. \" Why, of course, he's a vampyre,\" said Dick, \" and you may all of you expect to see him, iu turn, come into your bed room windows with a burst, and lay hold of you like a million and a half of leeches rolled into one.\" \"There you are,\" said Dick; \" d \u2014 d if I don't adopt you, and bring you up to the science of nothing.\" \" Now, listen to me, good people all,\" added Dick; \"I have really got some thing to say to you.\" At this intimation the people slowly gathered again round the grave. \"Listen,\" said Dick, solemnly; \"it strikes me there's some tremendous do going on.\" There was a general expression of horror, and then Dick continued \u2014 \" You'd better all of you go home ; I shall bave no hand in pulling up any more of thc coffins\u2014 this is a dose for me. Of course you can do what you like.\" \" Pull them all up !\" cried a voice ; \" Yes, there is,\" said several who were foremost. \"It won't be long before you'll all of you be most d\u2014 nably astonished ; but let"], [217, "VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE ; OR, THE FEAST OF BLOOD. 207 THE EXHUMATION OF THE BOBY OF THE BUTCHER. me beg of you not to accuse me of having anything to do with it provided I tell you all I know.\" fat friend as is dead and gone, that will astonish you all.\" Dick paused, and he gave the coffin a slight kick, as intimation to thc boy that he might as well be doing his part in the drama, upon which that ingenious youn r gentleman set np such a howl, that even Dick jumped, so unearthly did it sound within the confines of that receptacle of the dead. \" No, Dick, we won't \u2014 we won't\u2014 we won't.\" \" Good ; then, listen.

That'll do; and the proper way to put it, too. There's no mistake abput that, I can tell you.\" Henry, although he went through the ceremony of consulting his mother, had no sort of doubt before he did so that she was sufficiently aware of the feelings and wishes of Flora to be prepared to yield a ready assent to the proposition ot leaving the hall. Moreover, Mr. Marchdale had, from the first, been an advocate of such a course of proceeding, and Henry weU knew how strong an influence he bad over Mrs. Bannerworth's mind, in consequence of the respect in which she held him, as an old and valued friend. He was, therefore, prepared tor what his mother said, which was \u2014 _\" My dear Henry, you know that the wishes of my children, since they have been grown up, aud capable of coming to a judgment for themselves, have ever been laws to me. If you, among you all, agree to leave this place, do so.\" \"But will you leave it freely, mother ?\" \"Most freely I go with you all ; what is it that has made this house and all its ap- purtenances pleasant in my eyes, but the presence in it of those who are so dear to me?

He, however, now made his consent to depend wholly npon the full and free acquiescence of every member of the family. \" If,\" he said, \" there be any among us who will say to me\u2014' Continue to keep open the house in which we have passed so many happy hours, and let the ancient home of our race still afford a shelter to us,'\u2014 I shall feel myself bound to do so ; but if both my mother and my brother agree to a departure from it, and that its hearth shall be left cold and desolate, be it so.

There has hung a cloud of misfortune over us all since the garden of this house became the scene of an event which we can none they from all sort of society, that they had no notion of the popular disturbance which Varney the vampyre had given rise to. It was not until the following morning that Mr. Chillingworth, who had been home in the meantime, brought word of what had taken place, and that great com motion was still in the town, and that the civil authorities, finding themselves by far too weak to contend against the popular will, had sent for assistance to a garrison town-, some twenty-miles distant. It was a great grief to the Bannerworth family to hear these tidings, not that they were in a way, ex ept as victims, acces sory to creating the disturbance about the vampyre, but it seemed to promise a kind of notoriety which they might well 6hrink from, and which they were just tbe people to view with dislike. of us remember but with terror and shuddering.\" \"Two generations of our family must five and die before the remembrance of that circumstance can be obliterated. But we will think of it no more.\" There can be no doubt but that tbe dreadful circumstance to which both Mrs. Bannerworth and Henry alluded, was the suicide of the father of the family in the gardens, which before bas been h inted at in the course of this narration, a being a circumstance which had created a great sensation at the time, and cast a great gloom for many months over the family. The reader will, doubtless, too, recollect that, at his last inomeuts, this unhappy individual was said to have uttered some incoherent words about some hidden money, and that the rapid hand of death alone seemed to prevent him from being explicit upon that subject, and left it merely a matter of conjecture. As years had rolled on, this affair, even as a subject of speculation, had ceased to occupy the minds of any of the Banner worth family, and several of their friends, among whom was Mr. Marchdale, were decidedly of opinion that the apparently pointed and mysterious words uttered were but the disordered wanderings of an intellect already hovering on the confines of eternity. Indeed, far from any money, of any amount, being a disturbance to the last moments ofthe dissolute man, whose vices and extravagances had brought his family to such ruin, it was pretty generally be lieved that he had committed suicide sim ply from a conviction of the impossibility of raising any more supplies of cash, to enable him to carry on the career which he had pursued for so long. But to resume. View the matter bow we like, however, it is not to be considered as at all proba ble that the Baonerworth family would re main long in ignorance of what a great sensation they had created unwittingly in the neighbourhood. The very reasons which had induced their servants to leave their establishment, and prefer throwing themselves completely out of place rather than remain in so ill omened a house, were sure to be bruited about far and wide. And that, perhaps, when they came to consider of it, would suffice to form another good and substantial reason for leaving the hall, and seeking a refuge in obscurity from the extremely troublesome sort of popularity incidental to their pecu liar situation. Mr. Chillingworth felt uncommonly chary of telling them all that had taken place ; although he was well aware that the proceedings of the riotous mob had not terminated with the little disappoint ment at the old ruin, to which they had so effectually chased Varney the vampyre, but to lose him so singularly when he got there. No doubt he possessed the admiral v.ith the uproar that was going on in the town, for the latter did hint a little of it to Henry Bannerworth. \"Hilloa!' he said, to Henry, as he saw him walking in the garden; \"it strikes me, if you and your ship's crew continue in these lattitudes, you'll get as notorious as the Flying Dutchman in the southern ocean.\" Henry at once communicated to tho ad miral what his mother had said, and then the whole question regarding the removal being settled in the affirmative, nothing remained to be done but to set aboutit as quickly as possible. The Bannerworths lived sufficiently dis tant from the town to be out of ear-shot of the disturbances which were then taking place ; and so completely isolated were \" How do you mean ?\" said Henry. \" Why, it's a sure going proverb to say, that a nod 's as good as a wink ; but the fact is, it's getting rather too well known"], [220, "VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE; OR, 210 to be pleasant, that a vampyre has struck up rather a close acquaintance with your family.

How somdever, I must turn it over in my mind, and be even with him, some how. I owes him one sor that. I say, admiral.\" \" Yes; bother the particulars, for I don't know them ; but, hark ye, by-morrow I'll have found a place for you to go to, 60 pack up the sticks, get all your stores ready to clear out, and make yourself scarce from this place.\" \" I understand you,\" said Henry ; \" we have become the subject of popular ru mour; I've only to beg of you, admiral, that you'll say nothing of this to Flora ; she has already suffered enough, Heaven knows ; do not let her have the addi tional affliction of thinking that her name is made famUiar in every pot-house in the town.\" \" What now, you lubber?\" \" Nothin\" ; turn that over in your mind,\" and away Jack walked, not quite satisfied, but feeling, at least, that he had made a demonstration of attack. As for the admiral, he considered that the thump he had given Jack with the stick \u2014 and it was no gentle one\u2014 as a decided balancing of accounts up to that period, and as he remained likewise master of the field, he was upon the whole very well satisfied. \"Leave me alone for that,\" said the admiral. \" Do you think I am an ass?\" \" Ay, ay,\" said Jack Pringle, who came in at that moment, and thought tbe question was addressed to him, \" Who spoke to you, you bad-looking horse-marine?\" \" Me a horse-marine ! didn't you ask a plain question of a fellow, and get a plain answer?\" These last few words which had been spoken to Henry by Admiral Bell, more than any others, induced him to hasten his departure 'rom Bannerworth Hall ; he had walked away when the altercation between Jack Pringle and the admiral becan, for he had seen sufficient of those wordy con flicts between those originals to be quite satisfied that neither of them meant what he said of a discouraging character towards the other, and that far fro n there being any unfriendly seeling contingent upon those little affairs, they were onlv a species of friendly sparring, which both parties enjoyed extremely. Henry went direct to Flora, and he said to her \u2014 \"Why, you son of a bad-looking gun, what do you mean by that ? I tell you what it is, Jack; I've let you come sneaking too often on the quarter-deck, and now you come poking your fun at your officer, you rascal!\" \"I poking fun!\" said Jack, \"couldn't think of such a thing. I should just as soon think of your making a joke as me.\" \"Since we are all agreed upon tbe necessity, or, at all events, upon the ex pediency of a departure from the ball, I think, sister, the sooner we carry out that determination the better, and the plea santer for us all it wiU be.

It was in vain tbat he shouted \" Murder ! help ! fire ! thieves !\" Jack was inexorable, and the admiral pumped. Jack turned the fellow's head about in a * very scientific manner, so as t > give him a fair dose of hydropathic treatment, and in a few minutes, never was human being more thoroughly saturated with moisture than was Sir Francis Varney's servant. He had left off hallooing for aid, for he found that whenever he did so, Jack held his mouth under the spout, which was decidedly unpleasant ; so, with a patience that looked like heroic fortitude, he was compelled to wait until the admiral was tired of pumping. \" Very good,\" at length he said. \" Now, ' Jack, sor fear this fellow catches cold, be so good as to get a horsewhip, and sec him off the premises with it.\" \"Ay, ay, sir,\" said Jack. \"And I say, old fellow, you can take back all our blessed compliments now, and say you've been flurried a little yourself ; and if so be as you came here as dry as dust, d \u2014 e, you go back as wet as a mop.

D\u2014 n it, it is a do .'\" \"Very well \u2014 as you please, Jack.\" \" Then here goes ;\" and Jack proceeded to kick the shiveving animal from the gar den with a vehemence that soon convineed bim of the necessity of getting out of it as quickly as possible. How it was that Sir Francis Varney, after the fearful race he had had, got home again across the fields, free from all dan ger, and back to his own house, from whence he sent so cool and insolent a message, they could not conceive. The admiral's calmness during the latter part of the dialogue arose from the fact that over the flunkey's shoulder, and at some little distance off, he saw Jack Pringle taking off his jacket, and rolling up his sleeves in that deliberate sort of way, that seemed to imply a deter mination of setting about some species of work that combined the pleasant with the useful. But such must certainly be the fact ; somehow or another, he had escaped all danger, and, with a calm insolence peculiar to the man, he had no doubt adopted the present mode i f signifying as much to the Bannerworths. Jack executed many nods to and winks at the livery-servant, and jerked his thumb likewise in the direction of a pump near at hand, in a manner that spoke as plainly as possible, that John was to be pumped upon. The insolence of his servant was, no doubt, a matter of pre-arrangement with that individual, however he might have set about it con amore. As for the termi nation of the adventure, that, of course, had not been at all calculated upon ; but, like most tools of other people's insolence or ambition, the insolence of the underling had received both his own punishment and his master's. And now the conference was ended, and Sir Francis's messenger turned to go ; but Jack Pringle bothered him com pletely, for he danced round him in such a singular manner, that, turn which way he would, there stood Jack Pringle, in some grotesque attitude, intercepting him; and so he edged him on, till he got him to the pump. \"Jack.\" said the admiraL \"Ay, ay, sir.\" \"Don't pump on that fellow now.\" \"Ay, ay, sir ; give us a hand.\" Jack laid hold of him by the two ears We know quite enough of Sir Francis j Varney to feel assured that he would \\ rather consider it as a good jest than Otherwise of his footman, so that with tho I suffering he endured at the Eannenvorths',"], [223, "THE FEAST OF BLOOD. 213 and the want of the sympathy he was likely to find at home, that individual bad certainly nothing to congratulate himself upon but the melancholy reminiscence of his own cleverness. He had become seriously ill, and, after a few days of indisposition, which had puz zled the country practitioners, breathed his last. He was to have been buried in the vil lage churchyard on the very day of the riot and confusion incidental to the exhu mation of the coffin of the butcher, and probably from that circumstance we may deduce the fact of the presence ofthe cler gyman in canonicals at the period of the riot. When it was sound that so disorderly a mob possessed the churchyard, the idea of burying the stranger on that day was abandoned ; but still all would have gone on quietly as regarded him, had it not been for the folly of one of the chamber-maids at the tavern. But were the mob satisfied with what had occurred in the churchyard ? They were not, and that night was to witness the perpetration of a melancholy outrage, such as the history of the time presents no parallel to. The finding of a brick in the coffin of the butcher, instead of the body of that individual, soon spread as a piece of start ling intelligence all over the place ; and the obvious deduction that was drawn from the circumstance seemed to be, that the deceased butcher was unquestionably a vampyre, and out upon some expedition at the very time when his coffin was searched. This woman, with aU the love of gossip incidental to her class, had, from the first, entered so fully into aU the particulars con cerning vampyres, that she fairly might be considered to be a little deranged on that head. Her imagination had been so worked upon, tbat she was in an unfit state to think of anything else, and if ever upon anybody a stern and revolting super stition was calculated to produce direful effects, it was upon this woman. The town was tolerably quiet ; the pre sence of the soldiery had frightened some and amused others, and no doubt the night would have passed off serenely, had she not suddenly rushed into the streets, and, with bewildered accents, and frantic ges tures, shouted\u2014 \" A vampyre \u2014 a vampyre \u2014 a vampyre 1\" These words soon collected a crowd around her, and then, with screaming ac cents, which would bave been quite enough to convince any reflecting person that she had actually gone distracted upon that point, she cried \u2014 \" Come into the honse \u2014 come into the house ! Look upon the dead body, that should have been in its grave ; it's fresher now than it was the day on which it died, and there's a colour in its cheeks. A vam pyre \u2014 a vampyre \u2014 a vampyre ! Heaven save us from a vampyre 1\" The strange, infuriated, maniacal man ner in which these words were uttered, produced an astonishingly exciting effect among the mob. Several women screamed, and some few fainted. The torch was laid again to the altar of popular feeling, and the fierce flame of superstition burnt i brightly aud fiercely. Some twenty or thirty persons, with shouts and exclamations, rushed into the inn, while the woman who had created the disturbance still continued to rave, tearing How he had originally got out of that receptacle for the dead was certainly a mystery ; but the story was none the worse for that. Indeed, an ingenious individual found a solution for tbat part of the busi ness, for, as be said, nothing was more natural, when any one died who was capa ble of becoming a vampyre, than for other vampyres who knew it to dig him up, and lay him out in the cold beams of the moonlight, until he acquired the same sort of vitality they themselves possessed, and joined their horrible fraternity. In lieu of a better explanation\u2014 and, after all, it was no bad one\u2014 this theory was generaUy received, and, with a shud dering horror, people asked themselves, if the whole of the churchyard were exca vated, how many coffins would be found tenantless by the dead which had been supposed, by simple-minded people, to inhabit them. The presence, however, of a body of dragoons, towards evening, effectually pre vented any renewed attack upon the sacred precincts of the churchyard, and it was a strange and startling thing to see that country town under military surveillance, and sentinels posted at its principal build ings. This measure smothered the vengeance of the crowd, and insured, for a time, the safety of Sir Francis Varney ; for no con siderable body of persons could assemble for the purpose of attacking his house again, without being followed ; so snch a step was not attempted. It had so happened, however, that on that very day, the funeral of a young man was to have taken place, who had put up for a time at trie same inn where Admiral Bell was first introduced to the reader."], [224, "VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE. 214 her hair, and Bhrieking at intervals, until she fell exhausted upon the pavement. Soon, from a hundred throats, rose the dreadful cry of \"Avampyre\u2014 a vampyre!\" The alarm was given throughout the whole town ; the bugles of the military sounded ; there was a clash of arms \u2014 the shrieks of women; altogether, the premonitory symp toms of such a riot as was not likely to be queUed without bloodshed and consi derable disaster.

Here was a woman whoBe opinion would have been accounted valueless upon the most common-place subject, and whose word wonld not have passed for twopence, setting a whole town by the ears by force of nothing but her sheer brutal ignorance. It is a notorious physiological fact, that, after four or five days, or even a week, the bodies of many persons assume an ap pearance of freshness, such as might have been looked for in vain immediately after death. like to get a bad name, which would stick to them for years to come. It was no political riot, on which men might be supposed, in consequence of dif fering in opinion, to have their passions inflamed ; so that, although the call of the civil authorities for military aid had been acceded to, yet it was hoped, and, indeed, almost understood by the officers, that their operations would be confined more to a demonstration of power, than anything else. Besides, some of the men bad got talking to the townspeople, and had beard all about the vampyre story, and not being of the most refined or educated class themselves, they felt rather interested than otherwise in the affair. Under these circumstances, then, we are inclined to think, that the disorderly mob of that inn had not so wholesome a fear as it was most certainly intended they should have of the red coats. Then, again, they were not attacking the churchyard, which, in the first case, was the main point in dispute, and about which the authorities had felt so very sore, inasmuch as they felt that, if once the common people found out that the sanctity of such places could be outraged with impunity, they wonld lose their reverence for the church ; that is to say, for the host of persons who live well and get fat in this country by the trade of religion. Consequently, this 'churchyard was the main point of defence, and it was zealously looked to when it need not have been done so, while the public-house where there really reigned mischief was half unguarded. There are always in all communities, whether large or small, a number of persons who really have, or fancy they have, something to gain by disturbances. These people, of course, care not for what pretext the public peace is violated ; so long as there is a row, and something like an excuse for running into other people's houses, they are satisfied. To get into a public-house under such circumstances is au unexpected treat; and thus, when the mob rushed into the inn with such symptoms of fury and excite ment, there went with the leaders of the disturbance a number of persons who never thought of getting further than the bar, where they attacked the spirit-taps with an alacrity which showed how great was their love for ardent compounds. Leaving these persons behind, however, we will follow those who, with a reai superstition, and a furious interest in the affair of the vampyre, made their way to- It is one of the most insidious processes of that decay which appears to regret with its \u2014 \u00ab' effasive fingers, To mar the lines where beauty lingers.\" But what did the chamber-maid know of physiology ?

Let us precede the furious rioters for a few moments, and look upon thc chamber of the dead \u2014 that chamber which, for a whole week, had been looked upou with a kind of shuddering terror \u2014 that chamber which had been darkened by having its sources of light closed, as if it were a kind of disrespect to the dead to allow the pleasant sunshine to fall upon the faded form. It is astonishing what people will do in crowds, in comparison with thc acts that they would be able to commit indivi dually. There is usually a calmness, a sanctity, a sublimity about death, which irresistibly induces a respect for its pre sence, alike from the educated as from the Uliternte ; and let the object of the fell destroyer's presence be whom it may, the very consciousness that death has claimed And every inhabitant of that house, upon ascending and descending its intricate and Nj. 88."], [226, "VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE ; OR, 216 \" Psha !\" cried one who had arrived with a light; \"it's your cowardice that speaks. I'll go in first ; let those follow me who like, and those who are afraid may remain where they are.\" He at once dashed into the room, and this immediately broke the spell of fear which was beginning to creep over the others in consequence of the timid sug gestion of the man who, up to that mo ment, had been first and foremost in the enterprise. In an instant the chamber was half filled with persons, four or five of whom carried lights ; so that, as it was not of very large dimensions, it was sufficiently illu minated for every object in it to be dearly visible. There was the bed, smooth and unruffled, as if waiting for some expected guest; while close by its side a coffin, supported upon tressels, over which a sheet was partially thrown, contained the sad remains of him, who little expected in life that, after death, he should be stigmatised as an ex ample of one of the ghastliest superstitions that ever found 8 home in the human imagination. It was evident that some one had been in the room -, and that this was the woman whose excited fancy had led her to look npon the face of the corpse there could be no^doubt, for the sheet was drawn aside just sufficiently to discover the coun tenance. The fact was that the stranger was un known at the inn, or probably ere this tho coffin lid would have been screwed on ; but it was hoped up to the last moment, as advertisements had been put into the county papers, that s ome one would come forward to identify and claim him. Such, however, had not been the case, and so his funeral had been determined upon. ancient staircases, had walked with a quiet and subdued step past that one particular door. Even the tone of voice in which they spoke to each other, while they knew that that sad remnant of mortality was in the house, was quiet and subdued, as if the repose of death were but a mortal sleep, and could be broken by rude sounds. Ay, even some of these very persons, who now with loud and boisterous clamour had rushed into the place, had visited the house, and talked in whispers ; but then they were alone, and men will do in throngs acts which, individually, they would shrink from with compunction or cowardice, call it which we wilt The chamber of death is upon the second story of the house. It is a back room, the windows of whicb com mand a view of that half garden, half farm yard, which we find generally belonging to country inns. But now the shutters were closed, with the exception of one small opening, that in daylight would have admitted a straggling ray of light to fall upon the corpse. Now, however, that the sombre shades of evening had wrapped everything in gloom, the room appeared in total darkness, so that the most of those adventarers who had ventured into the place shrank back until lights were procured from the lower part of the house, with whicb to enter tbe room. A dim oil Iamp in a niche sufficiently lighted the staircase, and by the friendly aid of its glimmering beams they bad found their way up to the landing tolerably well, and had not thought of the necessity of having lights with wbich to enter the apartment until they sound themselves in utter darkness. These requisites, however, were speedily procured from the kitchen of the inn. Indeed, anything that was wanted was laid hold of without the least word of remark to the people of the place, as if might, from that evening forthwith, was understood to constitute right in that town. The presence of so many persons at once ' effectually prevented any individual from j exhibiting, even if he felt, any supersti tious fear about approaching the coffin ; ' and so, with one accord, they surrounded it, and looked upon the face ofthe dead. There was nothing repulsive in that countenance. The fact was that decom position had sufficiently advanced to induce a relaxation of the muscles, and a softening of the fibres, so that an appear ance of calmness and repose haa crept over the face which it did not wear imme diately after death. It happeued, too, that the face was full ! of flesh ; for the death had been sudden, and there had not been that wasting away of tbe musclei and integuments whicb Up to this point, no one had taken a very prominent part in the attack upon the inn, if attack it could be called ; but now the man whom chanco or his own nimble - ness made the first of the throng, as sumed to himself a sort of control over his companions, and turning to them, he said \u2014 \" Hark ye, my friends ; we'll do every thing quietly and properly ; so I think we'd better three or four of ns go in at once, arm-in-arm.\""], [227, "THE FEAST OF BLOOD. 217 makes the skin cling, as it were, to the bone, when the ravages of long disease have exhausted the physical frame. There was, unquestionably, a plump ness, a freshness, and a sort of vitality about the countenance that was remark able. \" Hold your tongue,\" said one ; \" we want none of your nonsense. Do you see any difference now in the face of the corpse to what it was some days since ?\" \" Well, I don't know ; somehow it don't look so rum.\" For a few moments there was a death like stiUness in the apartment, and then one voice broke the stillness by exclaim ing\u2014 \" He's a vampyre, and has come here to die. Well he knows he'd be taken up by Sir Francis Varney, and become one of the crew.\" \"Does it look fresher?\" \" Well, somehow or another, now you mention it, its very odd, but it does.\" \" Enough,\" cried the man who had ques tioned him, with considerable excitement of manner. \" Neighbours, are we to have our wives and our children scared to death by vampyres ?\" \" Yes, yes!\" cried several voices at once; \" a vampyre \u2014 a vampyre !\" \"Hold a moment!\" cried one; \"let us find somebody in the house who has seen him 6ome days ago, and then we can as certain if there is any difference in his looks.\" \" No \u2014 no !\" cried everybody. \" Is not this, then, one of that dreadful order of beings?\" \" Yes \u2014 yes! what's to be done?\" \" Drive a stake through the body, and so prevent the possibiUty of anything in the shape of a restoration.\" This was a terrific proposition ; and even those who felt most strongly upon the subject, and had their fears most awakened, shrank from carrying that into effect. Others, again, applauded it, al though they determined, in their own minds, to keep far enough from the execution of the job, which they hoped would devolve upon others, so that they might have the security of feeling that such a process had been gone through with the supposed vampyre without being in any way committed by the dreadful act. This suggestion was agreed to, and a couple of stout men ran down stairs, and returned in a few moments with a trembling waiter, whom they had caught in tbe passage, and forced to accompany them. This man seemed to think that he was to be made a dreadful example of in some sort of way ; and as he was dragged into the room, he trembled, and looked as pale as death. \" What have I done, gentlemen ?\" he said ; \" I ain't a vampyre. Don't be driving a stake through me. 1 assure you, gentlemen, I'm only a waiter, and have been for a matter of five-and-twenty years.\" \"You'U be done no harm to,\" said one of his captors ; \" you've only got to answer a question that wiU be put to you.\" \" Oh, well, certainly, gentlemen ; any thing you please. Coining \u2014 coming, as I always say; give your orders, the waiter's in the room.\" Nothing was easier than to procure a stake from the garden in the rear of the premises ; but it was one thing to have the means at hand of carrying into effect so dreadful a proposition, and another ac tually to do it. For the credit of human nature, we re gret that even then, when civilization and popular education had by no means made such rapid strides as in our times they have, such a proposition should be enter tainec1 for a moment ; but so it was ; and just as an alarm was given tbat a party of the soldiery had reached the inn, and had taken possession of the door way with a strong determination to arrest the rioters, a strong hedge-stake had been procured, and everything was in readiness for the perpetration of the horrible deed. \"Look upon the face of that corpse.\" \" Certainly \u2014 certainly ; directly.\" \" Have you ever seen it before?\" \" Seen it before !

These persons, infuriated by drink, were capable of anything, and to them, accord- ingly, the more sober parties gladly sur- rendered the disagreeable job of rendering the supposed vampyre perfectly innoxious, by driving a hedge-stake through his body \u2014 a proceeding which, it was currently believed, inflicted so much physical injury to the frame, as to render his resuscitation out of the question. The cries of alarm from below, joined now to the shouts of those mad rioters, produced a scene of dreadful confusion. We cannot, for we revolt at the office, describe particularly the dreadful outrage which was committed on the corpse ; suffice it that two or three, maddened by drink, and incited by the others, plunged the hedge-stake through the body, and there left it, a sickening and a horrible spectacle to any one who might cast his eyes upon it. With such violence had the frightful and inhuman deed been committed, tbat the bottom of the coffiu was perforated by the stake, so that the corpse was actually nailed to its last earthly tenement. The revolting task had been so promply and efficiently executed as to cause surprise at the amount of strength used to enable the madmen, for they were little better, to perforate with a stake the strong oak bot- tom ot the coffin. Some asserted, that at that moment an audible groan came from the dead man, and tbat this arose from the extinguish- ment of that remnant of life which re- mained in him, on account of his being a vampyre, and which would have been brought into full existence, if the body had been placed in the rays of the mooD, when at its lull, according to the popular super- stition upon that subject. Others, again, were quite ready to swear, that at the moment the stake was used, there was a visible convulsion of all the limbs, and that the countenanc *, before so placid and so calm, became immediately distorted, as if with agony. But we have done with those horrible surmises ; the dreadful deed has been committed, and wild, ungovernable super- stition bas had, for a time, its sway over the ignorant and debased. CHAPTEB XLIX.

When, however, the party reached the spot, and heard what confusion there was, and saw in what numbers the rioters were assembling, it became evident to them that the case was of a more serious complexion than they had at first imagined, and con sequently they felt that their professional dignity was not so much compromised with their interference with the lawless proceedings. Some ot the constabulary of the '.own were there, and to them the soldiers pro mised they would band what prisoners they took, at the same time they made a distinct condition that they were not to be troubled with their custody, nor in any way further annoyed in the business, be yond taking care that they did not abso lutely escape, after being once secured. This was aU that the civil authorities of the town required, and, in fact they hoped that, after making prisoners of a few of the ringleaders of the riotous proceedings the rest would disperse, and prevent the necessity of capturing them. Be it known, however, that both mili tary and civil authorities were com pletely ignorant of the dreadful out rage against all common decency which had been committed within the public house. The door was well guarded, and the question now was how the rioters were to be made to come down stairs, and be cap \u2022 tured ; and this was Ukely to remain a question, so long as no means were adopted to make them descend. So that, after a time, it was agreed that a couple of troopers should march up"], [229, "THE FEAST OF BLOOD. 219 with a constable, to enable him to se cure any one who 6eemed a principal in the riot. the other, they suddenly turned iu a body, and began to make sor the outskirts ol the town. But this only had the effect of driving those who were in the second-floor, and saw the approach of the two soldiers, whom they thought were backed by the whole of their comrades, up a narrow staircase, to a third-floor, rather con sisting of lofts than of actual rooms ; but, still, for the time, it was a refuge ; and owing to the extreme narrowness of the approach to it, which consisted of nearly a perpendicular staircase, with any degree of tact or method, it might have been ad mirably defended. In the hurry and scramble, all the lights were left behind ; and when the two sol diers and constables entered the room where the corpse had lain, they became for the first time aware of what a horrible purpose had been carried out by the in furiated mob. They then separated, as if by common consent, and straggled out into the open country by twos and threes, consolidating again into a mass when they had got some distance off, and clear of any exertions that could be made by the soldiery to stay them. The cry then rose of \" Down with Sir Francis Varney \u2014 slay him \u2014 burn his house \u2014 death to all vampyres !\" and, at a rapid pace, they proceeded in the direction of his mansion. We will leave this mob, however, for the present, and turn our attention to those who are at the inn, and are certainly in a position of some jeopardy. Their numbers were not great, and they were unarmed ; certainly, their best chance would have been to have surrendered at discretion ; but that was a measure which, if the sober ones had felt inclined to, those who were in furiated and half maddened with drink would not have acceded to on any account. A furious resistance was, therefore, fairly to be expected ; and what means the sol diery were likely to use for the purpose of storming this last retreat was a matter of rather anxious conjecture. In the case of a regular enemy, there would not, perhaps, have been much diffi culty ; but here the capture of certain persons, and not their destruction, was the object ; and how that was to be accom plished by fair means, certainly was a question which nobody felt very competent to solve. Determination, however, will do won ders ; and although the rioters numbered over forty, notwithstanding all their de sertions, and not above seventeen or eighteen soldiers marched into the inn, we shall perceive that they succeeded in accomplishing their object without any man\u0153uvring at all. The space in which the rioters were confined was low, narrow, and inconve nient, as well as dark, for the lights on the stairc se cast up to that height but very inefficient rays. Weapons of defence they found but very sew, and yet there were some which, to do them but common credit, they used as effectually as possible. These attics, or lofts, were used as lum ber-rooms, and had been so for years, so that there was a collection of old boxes, broken pieces of furniture, and other mat ters, which will, in defiance of everything and everybody, collect in a house. These were formidable means of defence, if not of offence, down a very narrow stair- The sight was one of perfect horror, and hardened to scenes which might strike other people as being somewhat of the terrific as these soldiers might be supposed to be, they actually sickened at the sight which the mutilated corpse presented, and turned aside with horror. Those feelings soon gave way to anger and animosity against the crowd who could be guilty of such an atrocious outrage ; and, for the first time, a strong and in terested vengeance agaiDst the mob per vaded the breasts of those who were brought to act against it. One of the soldiers ran down stairs to the door, and reported the scene which was to be seen above. A determination was in stantly come to, to capture as many as possible of those who had been concerned in so diabolical an outrage, and leaving a guard of five men at the door, the re mainder of the party ascended the stair case, determined upon storming the last refuge of the rioters, and dragging them to justice. The report, however, of these proceed ings that were taking place at the inn spread quickly over the whole town ; and 60on as large a mob of the disorderly and the idle as the place could at all afford was assembled outside the inn. This mob appeared, for a time, inertly to watch the proceedings. It seemed rather a hazardous thing to interfere with the soldiers, whose carbines looked formida ble and troublesome weapons. With true mob courage, therefore, they left the minority of their comrades, who were within the house, to their fate ; and after a whispered conference from one to"], [230, "220 VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE; OR, case, had they been used with judg ment. those men who had been so valorous a short time since recovered from the tre mendous fright into which they had been thrown. Some of the rioters, who were only just drunk enough to be fool-hardy, coUected a few of these articles at the top of the stair case, and swore they wonld smash any body who should attempt to come up to them, a threat easier uttered than exe cuted. We need hardly say that the carbines were loaded but with blank cartridges, for there was neither a disposition nor a necessity for taking the lives of these mis guided people. It was the snddenness and the steadiness of the attack that had done all the mis chief to their cause ; and now, ere they recovered from the surprise of having their position so completely taken by storm, they were handed down stairs, one by one, from soldier to soldier, and into ' the cus tody of the civil authorities. In order to secure the safe keeping of so large a body of prisoners, the consta bles, who were in a great minority,, placed handcuffs upon some of the most capable oi resistance; so what with those who were thus secured, and those who were terrified into submission, there was not a man of all the lot wbo had taken refuge in the attics of the public-bouse but was a prisoner. At the sonnd of fire-arms, the women who were outside the inn had, of course, raised a most prodigious clamour. They believed directly that every bullet mnst have done some most serious mischief to the townspeople, and it was only upon one of the soldiers, a non-commissioned officer, who waB below, assuring them of the innoxious nature of the proceeding which restored anything Uke equanimity. \" SUence !\" he cried ; \" what are you howling about ? Do you fancy that we've nothing better to do than to shoot a parcel of fellows that are not worth the bullets that would be lodged in their confounded carcases ?\" And, besides, after all, if their position had been ever so impregnable, they must come down eventually, or be starved out. But the soldiers were not at liberty to adopt so slow a process of overcoming their enemy, aud up the second-floor staircase they went, with a determination of making short work of the business. They paused a moment, by word of com mand, on the landing, and then, after this slight pause, the word was given to ad vance. Now when men will advance, in spite of anything and everything, it is no easy matter to stop them, and he who was foremost among the military would as soon thought of hesitating to ascend the narrow staircase before him, when ordered so to do, as paying the national debt. On he went, and down came a great chest which, falling against his feet knocked him down as he attempted to scramble over it \" Fire,\" said the officer ; and it appeared that he had made some arrangements as to how the order was to be obeyed, for the second man sired his carbine, and then scrambled over his prostrate comrade ; after which he stooped, and the third fired his carbine likewise, and then hurried forward in the same manner. At the first sound of the fire-arms the rioters were taken completely by surprise ; they had not had the least notion of affairs getting to such a length. The smeU of the powder, the loud report, and the sensation of positive danger that accompanied these phenomena, alarmed them most terrifi cally ; so that, in point of fact, with the exception of the empty chest that was thrown down in the way of the first sol dier, no further idea of defence seemed in any way to find a place in the hearts of the besieged. They scrambled one over the other in their eagerness to get as far as possible from immediate danger, which, of course, they conceived existed in the most immi nent degree the nearest to the door. Such was the state of terror into which they were thrown, that each one at the moment believed himself shot, and the soldiers had overcome all the real difficul ties in getting possession of what might thus be called the citadel of the inn, belore | \" But we heard the guns,\" said a woman. \" Of course you did ; it's the powder that makes the noise, not the bullet. You'll see them all brought out safe wind and Umb.\" This assurance satisfied the women to a certain extent, and such had been their fear that they should have had to look upon the spectacle of death, or of grievous wounds, that they were comparatively quite satisfied when they saw husbands, fathers, and bro thers, only in the custody of the town officers. And very sheepish some of the feUows looked, when they were handed down and handcuffed, and the more especially when they had been routed only by a few blank cartridges \u2014 that sixpenny worth of powder had defeated them. They were marched off to the town gaol,"], [231, "THE FEAST OF ELOOD. 221 gnaroed by the military, who now probably fancied tbat their night's work was over, and that the most turbulent and trouble some spirits in the town had been secured. Such, however, was not the case, for no sooner had comparative order been re stored, than common observation pointed to a dull red glare in the southern sky. In a few more minutes there came in stragglers from the open country, shouting \" Fire ! fire !\" with aU their might. \"Death to the vampyre! \u2014 death to tho vampyre !\" was tbe principal shout, and it was uttered in tones which soundel like those of rage and disappointment. But it is necessary, now that we have disposed of the smaller number of rioters who committed so serious an outrage at tho inn, that we should, with some degree of method, follow the proceedings ol th \u2022 larger number, who went from the to.va towards Sir Francis Varney's. These persons either had information of a very positive nature, or a very swung suspicion that, notwithstanding the mys- terious and most unaccountable disappear- ance of the vampyre in the old ruin, he wonld now be found, as usual, at his own residence. Perhaps one of his own servants may have thus played the traitor to him ; but, however it was, there certainly was an air of confidence about some of the leaders of the tumultuous assemblage that induced a general belief that this time, at least, the vampyre would not escape popular ven- geance for being what he was. We have before noticed that these people went out of the town at different points, and did not assemble into one mass] until they were at a sufficient dis tance off to be free from all fear of obser vation. CHAPTER L. THE MOE'S AKEIVAL AT SIR FRANCIS VAR- KEY'S.\u2014 THE ATTEMPT TO CAIN AD- MISSION. ll eyes were directed to- wards that southern sky which each moment was now becoming more and more illuminated by the lurid ap- pearance be- speaking a conflagration, Then some of the less observant and cautions of them began to indulge in shouts of rage and defiance ; but those who placed themselves foremost succeeded in procuring a halt, and one said\u2014 \"Good friends aU, if we make any noise, it can only have one effect, and that is, to warn Sir Francis Varney, and enable him to escape. If, therefore, we cannot go on quietly, I propose that we return to our homes, for we shall accomplish nothing.\" This advice was sufficiently and evidently reasonable to meet with no dissension ; a death-like stiUness ensued, only broken by some two or three voices saying, in subdued tones \u2014 which, if it was not extensive, at all events was raging fiercely. There came, too, npon the wind, which set from that direction, strange sounds, rasembling shouts of triumph, combined occasionally with sharper cries, indicative of alarm. With so much system and so quietly had this attack been made upon the honse of Sir Francis Varney \u2014 for the consequences of it now exhibited themselves most un- equivocally \u2014 that no one who had not actually accompanied the expedition was in the least aware that it had been at aU undertaken, or that anything of the kind was on the tapis. \" Now, however, it could be no longer kept a secret, and as the infuriated mob, who had sought (this flagrant means of giving vent to their anger, saw the flames from the blazing house rising high in the heavens, they felt convinced that further secrecy was out of the question. Accordingly, in such cries and shouts as \u2014 but sor caution's sake \u2014 they would have indulged in from the very first, S they now gave utterance to their feelings as re garded the man whose destruction was aimed at. \"That's right\u2014 that's right Nobody speak.\" \"Come on, then,\" said he who had given such judicious counsel ; and the dark mass of men moved towards Sir Francis Varney's honse, as quietly as it was possible for such an assemblage to proceed. Indeed, save the sound of the footsteps, nothing could be heard of them at aU ; and that regular tramp, tramp, would have puzzled any one listening to it from any distance to know in which direction it was proceeding."], [232, "VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE. 222 The man had the ponderous old-fashioned knocker in his hand, and was about to make another appeal to Sir Francis Var- ney's door, when a strange voice said\u2014 \" Perhaps you may as well say at once what you want, instead of knocking there to no purpose.\" He gave a start, for the voice seemed to come from the very door itself. Yet it sounded decidedly human ; and npon a closer inspection, it was seen that a little wicket- gate, not larger than a man's face, had been opened from within. This was terribly provoking. Here was an extent of caution on the part of the garrison quite unexpected. What was to be done? \"Well?\" said the man who appeared at the little opening. \" Oh,\" said he who had knocked ; \u00abI \" In this way they went on until Sir Francis Varney's house was reached, and then a whispered word to halt was given, and all eyes were bent upon the building. From but one window out of the nume rous ones with whicb the front of the man sion was studded did there shine the least light, and from that there came rather an uncommonly bright reflection, probably arising from a reading lamp placed close to the window. A general impression, they knew not \u2022.\u25a0.\u25a0hy exactly, seemed to pervade everybody, tnut in the room from whence streamed that bright light was Sir Francis Varney. \" The vampyre's room !\" said several. \" The vampyre's room ! That is it !\" \" Yes,\" 6aid he who had a kind of moral control over his comrades; \"I have no doubt but he is there.\" \" What's to be done?\" asked several. \"WeU?\" \" I\u2014 that is to say\u2014 ahem ! IsSir Francis Varney within?'1 \" Make no noise whatever, but stand aside, so as not to be seen from the door | when it it opened.\" \"Yes, yes.\" \"I will knock for admittance, and the \" Well?\" \" I say, is Sir Francis Varney within?\" \" Well ; you bave said it.\" \" Ab, but you have not answered it\" \"No.\" moment it is answered, I will place this stick in such a manner within, that the door cannot be closed again. Upon my saying ' Advance,' you will make a rush forward, and we shall have possession im mediately of tho house.\" All this was agreed to. The mob shrunk close to the walls of the house, and out of \"Well, is he at home?\" \" I decline saying ; so you had better, all of you, go back to tho town again, for we are well provided with all material to resist any attack you may be fools enough to make.\" immediate observation from the hall-door, or from any of the windows, and then the leader advanced, and knocked loudly for admission. As he spoke, tho servant shut the little square door with a bang that made his questioner jump again. Here was a di lemma ! Tile silence was now of the most com plete character that could be imagined. Those who came there so bent upon ven geance were thoroughly convinced of the necessity of extreme caution, to save themselves even yet from being completely soiled. \u2022 They had abundant faith, from expe rience, of th6 resources in the way of escape of Sir Francis Varney, and not one among them was there who con sidered that there was any chance of cap turing him, except by surprise ; and when once they got hold of him, they deter mined he should not easily slip through their fingers. The knock for admission produced no effect ; and, after waiting three or four minutes, it was very provoking to find such a wonderful amount of caution and cun ning completely thrown away. \" Try again,\" whispered one. \"Well, have patience; lam going to try again.\" CHAPTER LI. THE ATTACK UPON THE VAMPYRE's HOUSE. \u2014 THE FURY OF THE ATTACK. \u2014 THE FORCING OF THE DOORS, AND THE STRUGGLE. COUNCIL Of war was now called among the bellige rents, who were some what taken aback by the steady refusal of the servant to admit them, and their ap parent deter mination to resist all endeavours on the part of the mob to get into and obtain possession of the"], [233, "VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE ; OR THE FEAST OF BLOOD. 223 No. 29. house. It argued that they were prepared to resist all attempts, and it would cost some few lives to get into the vampyre's house. This passed through the minds of many as they retired behind the angle of the wall where the council was to be held. Here they looked in each other's face as if to gather from that the general tone of the feelings of their companions ; but here they saw nothing that intimated the least idea of going back as they came. \" It's all very weU, mates, to take care of ourselves, you know,\" began. one.tall, BE DISCOVERY OF THE DESECRATED CORPS \" Ay, ay, that's the way he does ; bring him out, I say, then see what we will do with him.\" \" Yes, catch him first,\" said one, \" and then we can dispose of him afterwards.

That's what I want to know.\" Fortunately for the party retiring the man couldn't take any aim, else it is ques tionable how many of the party would have got off unwonnded. As it was, several of them found stray sings were lodged in various parts of their persons, and accele rated their retreat from the house of the vampyre. \"What luck?\" inquired one of tbe mob to the others as they came back ; \" I'm afraid you had all the honour.\" \" Ay, ay, we have, and all the lead too,\" repUed a man, as he placed his hand upon a sore part of his person, which bled in consequence of a wound. \"Well, what's to be done?\" \"Danged if I know,\" said one. \" Give it up,\" said another. \"No, no ; have him out. I'll never give in while I can use a stick. They are in earnest and so are we. Don't let us be frightened because they have a gun or two \u2014 they can't have many; and, besides, if they have, we are too many for them. Besides, we shall all die in our beds.\" \"Hurrah! down with the vampyre!\" shouted the mob. \" So say I, lads. I don't want to be sucked to death wheu I'm a-bed. Better die like a man than such a dog's death as that, and you have no revenge then.\" \" No, no ; he has the better of us then. We'll have him out \u2014 we'U bum him\u2014 that's the way we'U do it\" \" To bo sure we can.\" \"Then we'll do it, mate\u2014 that's my mind \u2014 we'U do it. Come on, and let's have another look at the street-door.\" The big countryman left the main body, and resolutely walked up to the principal avenue, and approached the door, accom panied by about a dozen or less of the mob. When they came to the door, they com menced knocking and kicking most vio lently, and assailing it with aU kinds of things they could lay their hands upon. They continued at this violent exercise for some time \u2014 perhaps for five minutes, when the Uttle square hole in the door was. again opened, and a voice was heard to \" Ay, so we wUl ; only let us get in.\" At that moment a chosen party returned who had been round the house to make a reconnoissance. \" WeU, weU,\" inquired the mob, \" wbat can be done now \u2014 where can we get in?\" \" In several places.\" \" All right\u2014 come along then \u2014 the place is our own.\" \" Stop a minute ; they are armed at all points, and we must make an attack on aU points, else we may fail.

Two or three of the mob reeled and fell. This produced a momentary panic, and the servants then had the whole ofthe vic tory to themselves, and were about to charge and clear the passage of their enemies, when a shout behind attracted their attention. That shout was caused by an entrance being gained in another quarter, whence the servants were flying, and all was dis order. \" Hurrah\u2014 hurrah !\" shouted the mob. The servants retreated to the stairs, and here united they made a stand, and re solved to resist the wholefbrce ofthe rioters, and they succeeded in doing so for some minutes. Blows were given and taken of a desperate character. Somehow, there was no deadly blows received by the servants ; they were being forced and beaten, but they lost no life ; this may be accounted for by the fact that the mob used no more deadly weapons than sticks. The mob now moved away in different bodies, each strong enough to carry the house. They seized upon a variety of poles and stones, and then made for the doors aud windows that were pointed out by those who had made the discovery. Each one of those who had formed the party of observation, formed a leader to the others, and at once proceeded to the post assigned to him. The attack was so sudden and so simul taneous that the servants were unprepared ; and though they ran to the doors and fired away, still they did but little good, for the dcors were soon forced open by the enraged rioters, who proceeded in a much more systematic operation, using long heavy pieces of timber which were carried on the shoulders of several men, and driven with the force of battering rams\u2014which, in fact, they were \u2014 against the door. Bang went the battering-ram, crash went the door, and the whole party rushed headlong in, carried forward by their own momentum, and fell prostrate, engine and ali, into the passage. \" Now, then, we have them,\" exclaimed the servants, who began to belabour the whole party with blows, with every weapon they could secure. Loudly did the fallen men shout for as sistance, and but for their fellows who came rushing ia behind, they would have had but a sorry time of it. \"Hurrah!\" shouted the mob; \"the house is our own.\" The servants of Sir Francis Varney, on the contrary, were mostly armed with deadly weapons, which, however, they did not use unnecessarily. They stood upon the hall steps\u2014 the grand staircase, with long poles or sticks, about the size ot quarter-staves, and with these they belaboured those below most unmercifully. Certainly, the mob were no means cowards, for the strnggle to close with their enemies was as great as ever, and as firm as could well be. Indeed, they rushed on with a desperation truly cha racteristic of John Bull, and defied tbe heaviest blows ; for as fast as one was stricken down another occupied his place, and they insensibly pressed their close and compact front upon the ser vants, who were becoming fatigued and \" Fire' again,\" exclaimed a voice from among the servants. The mob made a retrograde movement, but stiU continued to press onwards, and in another moment a loud report rang through the house, and a smoke hung over the heads of the mob.

This visit is kind.\" hurrah 1\" they shouted a num- I mag\u2122 her of times, in a wild strain of delight. \" Hurrah \u2014 hur rah \u2014 hurrah !\" The fact was, a party of the mob had clambered up the verandah, and entered some of the rooms up stairs, whence they emerged just above the landing near the spot where the servants were resisting in a mass the efforts of the mob. \" Hurrah !\" shouted the mob below. \" Hurrah !\" shouted the mob above. There was a momentary pause, and the servants divided themselves into two bodies, and one turned to face those above, and the other those who were below. A simultaneous shout was given by both parties of the mob, and a sudden rush was made by both bodies, and the servants of Sir Francis Varney were broken in an instant. They were instantly separated, and knocked about a good bit, but they were left to shift for themselves, for the mob had a more important object in view. The mob looked at Sir Francis, and then at each other, and then at Sir Francis again ; but nobody spoke. They were awed by this gentlemanly and col lected behaviour. \" If you honour me with this visit from pure affection and neighbourly good-will, I thank you.\" \" Down with the vampyre !\" said one, who was concealed by the rest, and not so much overawed, as he had not seen Sir Francis. Sir Francis Varney rose to his full height; a light gleamed across his fea tures ; they were strongly defined then. His long front teeth, too, showed most strongly when he smiled, as he did now, and said in a bland voice \u2014 \" Gentlemen, I am at your service. Permit me to say you are welcome to all I can do for you. I fear the interview will be somewhat inconvenient and un pleasant to you. As for myself, I am en tirely at your service.\" As Sir Francis spoke, he bowed, and folded his hands together, and stepped forwards; but, instead of coming onwards to them, he walked behind the curtain and was immediately hid from their* \"Down with the vampyre!\" they shouted. \"Down with the vampyre!\" shouted they, and they rushed helter skelter through the rooms, untU they came to one where the door was partially open, and they could see some person very lei surely seated. \" Here he is,\" they cried. \"Who\u2014 who?\" view,"], [237, "THE FEAST OP BLOOD. 229 proportion, and they shouted and screamed with a proportionate increase of noise and bustle ; and at length they ran about mad with rage and vexation, doing all the mis chief that was in their power to inflict- Then they became mischievous, and tore the furniture from its place, and broke it in pieces, and then amused themselves with breaking it up, throwing pieces at the pier-glasses, in which they made dreadful holes ; and when that was done they broke up the frames. Every hole and corner of the house was searched ; but there was no Sir Francis Varney to be found. \" The cellars, the cellars '.\" shouted a voice. \" The cellars, the cellars !\" re-echoed nearly every pair of lips in the whole place; in another moment there was crushing and crowding to get down into the cellars. \"Hurray !\" said one, as he knocked off the neck ot the bottle that first came to hand. \" Here's luck to vampyre-hunting ! Success to our chase !\" \"So say I, neighbour ; but is that your manners to drink before your betters ?\" So saying, the speaker knocked the other's elbow, while he was in the act of lifting the wine to his mouth ; and thus he upset it over his face and eyes. \" D \u2014 n it !\" cried the man ; \" how it makes my eye3 smart ! Dang thee ! if I could see, I'd ring thy neck !\" \"Success to vampyre-hunting?\" said one. \" May we be lucky yet !\" said another. \"I wouldn't be luckier than this,\" said another, as he, too, emptied a bottle. \" We couldn't desire better entertainment) where the reckoning is all paid.\" \" Excellent !\" \" Very good !\" \" Capital wine this !\" \"I say, Huggins!\" \" Well,\" said Hugging. \" What are yon drinking ?\" \" Wine.\" \u00ab' What wine ?\" \" Danged if I know,\" vra.i the reply. \"It's wine, I suppose ; for I know it ain't beer nor spirits ; so it must be wine.\" \"Are you sure it ain't bottled men's blood ?\" \"Eh?\" \" Bottled blood, man ! Who knows what a vampyre drinks ? It may be his wine. He may feast upon that before he goes to bed of a night, drink anybody's health, and make himself cheerful on bottled blood !\" . , _ . . - \" Oh danged ! I'm so 6ick _ J wish I hadn't taken the stuff, It may be as you \" Down with the vampyre 1\" shonted one. \" Down with the vampyre !\" rang through the apartment ; and the mob now, not awed by the coolness and courtesy of Sir Francis, rushed forward, and overturning the table, tore down the curtain to the floor; but to their amaze ment, there was no Sir Francis Varney present. \"Where is he?\" \" Where is the vampyre ?\" \" Where has be gone ?\" These were cries that escaped every one's lips; but yet no one could give an answer to them. There Sir Francis Varney was not. They were completely thunderstricken. They could not find out where he had gone to. There was no possible means of escape, that they could perceive. There was not an odd corner, or even anything that could, by any possibility, give even a suspicion that even a temporary concealment could take place. They looked over every inch of flooring and of wainscotting ; not the remotest trace could be discovered. \" Where is he ?\" \"I don't know,\" said one\u2014 \"I can't see where he could have gone. There ain't a hole as big as a keyhole.\" \" My eye !\" said one ; \" I shouldn't be at all surprised, if he were to blow up the whole house.\" \" You don't say so !\" \" I never heard as how vampyres could do so much as that. They ain't the sort of people,\" said another. \" But if they can do one thing, they can do another.\" \"That's very true.\" \" And what's more, I never heard as how a vampyre could make himself into nothing before ; yet he has done so.\" \" He may be in this room now.\" \"He may.\" \" My eyes ! what precious long teeth he had I\" ' \"Yes ; and had he fixed one on 'em into your arm, he would have drawn every drop of blood out of yoor body ; you may depend upon that,\" said an old man. \" He was very tall.\" \" Yes ; too tall to be any good.\" \"I shouldn't like him to have laid hold of me, though, tall as he is j and then he would have lifted me up high enough to break my neck, when he let me fall.\" The mob routed about the room, tore everything out of its place, and as the object of their search seemed to be far enough beyond their reach, their cowege rose in"], [238, "VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE ; OR, 228 say, neighbour, and then we be canni bals.\" *' Or vampyres.\" \" There's a pretty thing to think of.\" By this time seme were drunk, some were partiaUy so, and the remainder were crowd ing into the cellars to get their share of the wine. The servants had now slunk away ; they were no longer noticed by the rioters, who, having nobody to oppose them, no longer thought of anything, save the searching after the vampyre, and the destruction of the property. Several hours had been spent in this manner, and yet they could not find the object of their search. There was not a room, or cupboard, or a cellar, that was capable of containing a cat, that they did not search, besides a part of the rioters keeping a very strict watch on the outside of the house and all about the grounds, to prevent the possibUity of the escape of the vampyre. There was a general cessation of active hostilities at that moment ; a reaction after the violent excitement and exertion they had made to get in. Then the escape of their victim, and the mysterious manner in which he got away, was also a cause of the reaction, and the rioters looked in each other's countenances inquiringly. Above all, the discovery of the wine cellar tended to withdraw them from vio lent measures ; but this conld not last long, there must be an end to such a seene, for there never was a large body of men assembled sor an evU purpose, who ever were, for any length of time, peaceable. To prevent the more alarming effects of drunkenness, some few of the rioters, after having taken some small portion of the wine, became, from the peculiar flavour it possessed, imbued with the idea that it was really blood, and forthwith commenced an instant attack upon the wine and li quors, and they were soon mingUng in one stream throughout tbe ceUars. The ends of large and valuable pipes of wine were staved in, and their contents commingling, formed a black liquid mass on the cellar floor that reached nearly to the knees of the rioters who were engaged in that portion of their destructive opera tions.

Many believed tbat he was yet about the house, while many were of opinion that he had flown away by some mysterious means only possessed by vam pyres and such like people. \" Fire the house, and bum him out,\" said one. \" Fire the house !\" * \"Burn the den!\" now arose in shouts from all present, and then the mob were again animated by Ihe love of mischief, that seemed to be the strongest feeling that animated them. \" Burn him out \u2014 burn him out !\" were the only words that could be heard from any of the mob. The words ran through the house like wild-fire, nobody thought of anything else, and all were seen running about in confusion. There was no want of good-will on the part of the mob to the undertaking ; far from it, and they proceeded in the work con amore. They worked together with right good will, and the result was soon seen by the heaps of combustible materials that were collected in a short time from aU parts of the house. All the old dry wood furniture that could be found was piled up in a heap, and to these were added a number of faggots, and also some shavings that were found in the cellar. \"All right!'\" exclaimed one man, in exultation. This destruction was loudly declaimed against by a large portion of the rioters, who were drinking ; bat before they could make any efforts to save the liquor, the work of destruction had not only been begun, but was ended, and the conse quence was, the cellars were very soon evacuated by the mob. \" YeB,\" repUed a second ; \" all right\u2014 aU right ! Set light to it, and he wiU be smoked out if not burned.\" \"Let us be sure that all are out of the house,\" suggested one of the by standers. \" Ay, ay,\" shouted several ; \" give them aU a chance. Search through the house and give them a warning.\""], [239, "THE FEAST OF BLOOD. 229 \"Very well ; give me the Ught, and then when I come back I will set light to the fire at on- e, and then I shall know all is empty, and so will you too.\" \" Ha! where is he?\" said another. \" If he be there,\" said the man, pointing to the flames, \" I reckon he's got a warm berth of it, and at the same time, very little water to boil in his kettle.\" This was at once agreed to by all, with acclamations, and the light being handed to the man, he ascended the stairs, crying out in a loud voice \u2014 \" Ha, ha ! what a funny old man is Bob Mason \u2014 he's always poking fun \u2014 he'd joke if his wife were dying.\" \" There is many a true word spoken in jest,\" suggested another ; \" and, to my mind, Bob Mason wouldn't be very much grieved if his wife were to die.\" \"Die?\" said Bob; \"she and I have lived and quarreUed daily a matter of five and-thirty years, and, if that ain't enough to make a man sick of being married, and of his wife, hang me, that's all. I say I am tired.\" \" Come out\u2014 come ont ! the house is on fire !\" \"Fire ! fire ! fire !\" shouted the mob as a chorus, every now and then at intervals. Iu about ten minutes more, there came a cry of \" all right ; the house is empty,\" from up the stairs, and the man descended in haste to the hall. \" Make haste, lads, and fire away, for I see the red coats are leaving the town.\" \"Hurra ! hurra !\" shouted the infuriated mob. \"Fire \u2014 fire\u2014 fire the house ! Burn out the vampyre I \u2014 Burn down the bouse \u2014 burn him out, and see if he can stand fire.\" This was said with much apparent sin cerity, and several laughed at the old man's heartiness. \" It's all very well,\" said the old man ; \" it's all very well to laugh about matters you don't understand ; but I know it isn't a joke \u2014 not a bit on it I tells you what it is, neighbour, I never made but one grand mistake in all my Use.\" \"And what was that?\" Amidst all this tumult there came a sud den blaze upon all around, for tbe pUe had been fired. \" Hurra !\" shouted the mob, \" hurra !\" and they danced like maniacs round the fire ; looking, in fact, like so many wild Indians, dancing round their roasting victims, or some demons at an infernal feast. \" To tie myself to a woman.\" \"Why, you'd get married to-morrow if your wife were to die to-day,\" said one. \" If I did, I hope I may marry a vam pyre. I should have something then to think about. I should know what's o'clock. But, as for my old woman, lord, lord, I wish Sir Francis Varney had had her sor life. I'll warrant when the next natural term of his existence came ronnd again, he wouldn't be in no hurry to renew it ; if he did, I should say that vampyres had the happy lot of managing women which I haven't got\" \" No, nor anybody else.\" A loud shout now attracted their atten tion, and, npon looking in the quarter whence it came, they descried a large body of people coming towards them ; from one end of the mob could be seen a long string of red coats. The torch had been put to twenty dif ferent places, and the flames united into one, and suddenly shot up with a velocity, and roared with a sound that caused many who were present to make a precipitate retreat from the haU. This soon became a necessary measure of self-preservation, and it required no urging to induce them to quit a place that Was burning rapidly and even furiously. \" Get the poles and firewood\u2014 get fag gots,\" shouted some of the mob ; and, lo, it was done almost by magic. They brought the faggots and wood pUed up for winter use, and laid them near all the doors, and especially the main entrance. Nay, every gate or door belonging to the outhouses was brought forward and placed npon the fire, which now began to reach the upper stories. \"Hurra\u2014 fire 1 Hurra\u2014 fire !\" \" The red coats !\" shouted one. \" The military !\" cried another. It was plain the military who had been placed in the town to quell disturbances had been made acquainted with the pro ceedings at Sir Francis Varney's house, and were now marching to relieve the place, and to save the property. They were, as we have stated, accom panied by a vast concourse of people, who came out to see what they were going to see, and seeing the flames at Sir Francis Varney's house, they determined to come all the way, and be present. And a loud shout of triumph came from the mob as they viewed the progress of the flames, as they came roaring and tearing through the house doors and win dows. Each new victory of the element was a signal to the mob for a cheer \u2014 and a hearty cheer, too, came from them. \"Where is the vampyre, now?\" ex claimed one."], [240, "230 VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE. The military, seeing the disturbance in tie distance, and the flames issuing from the windows, made the best of their way towards the scene of tumult with what speed they could make. \" Here they come,\" said one. \" Yes, just in time to tee what is done,\" said another. \" Yes, they can go back and say we have bnrned the vampyre's house down- hurra !\" \" Hurra !\" shouted the mob, in pro- longed accents, and it reached the ears of the military. The officer urged the men onwards, and they responded to his words, by exerting themselves to step out a little faster. \" Ob, they should have been here before this ; it's no nse, now, they are too late.\" \" Yes, they are too late.\" \" I wonder if the vampyre can breathe through the smoke, and live in fire?\" said one. \"I should think he must be able to do so, if he can stand shooting, as we know he can \u2014 yon can't kill a vampyre ; hot yet he must be consum d, if the fire ac- tually touches him, but not else ; he can .bear almost anything,\" \"So he can.\" \"Hurra !\" shouted the mob, as atall flame shot through the top windows of the house. The fire had got the ascendant now, and no hopes could be entertained, however extravagant, of saving the smallest article that had been left in t be mansion. \"Hurra !\" shouted the mob with the military, who came up with them. \" Hurra !\" shouted the others in reply. \" Quick march !\" said the officer ; and then, in a loud, commanding tone, he shouted\u2014\" Clear the way, there \u2014 clear the way.\" \"Ay, there's room enough sor yon,\" said old Mason ; \" what are yon making so much noise about?\" There was a general laugh at the officer, who took no notice of the words, but ordered his men up before the burning pile, which was now an immense mass of flame. The mob who had accompanied the military, now mingled with the mob that bad set the house of Sir Francis Varney on fire ere the military had come up with them. \" Halt !\" cried out the officer ; and the men, obedient to the word of command, halted, and drew np in a double line before the house. There werethen some words of command issued, and some more given to some of the subalterns, and a party of men, under the command of a sergeant, was sent off from the main body, to make a circuit of the bouse and grounds. The officer gazed for some moments upon the burning pile without speaking ; and then, turning to the next in command, he said, in low tones, as he looked npon the mob\u2014 \" We have come too late.\" \" Yes, much.\" \"The house is now nearly gutted.\" \"It is.\" \"And those who came crowding along with us are inextricably mingled with the others who have been the cause of all this mischief: there's no distingnishing them one from another.\" \" And if you did, you could not say who had done it, and who had not ; yon could prove nothing.\" \" Exactly.\" \" I shall not attempt to take prisoners, unless any act is perpetrated beyond what has been done.\" \" It is a singular affair.\" \"Very.\" \" This Sir Francis Varney is represented to be a courteous, gentlemanly man,\" said the officer. \" No doubt about it, but he's beset by a parcel of people who do not mind cutting a throat if they can get an opportunity of doing so.\" \" And I expect they will.\" \" Yes, when the.-e is a popular excite- ment against any man, he had better leave this part at once and altogether.

The darkness of night was stiU fast closing around them. The mob stood a motley mass of human beings, wedged together, dark and sombre, gazing upon the mis chief that had been done \u2014 the work of their hands. The military stood at ease before the burning pile, and by their order and regularity, presented a contrast to the mob, as strongly by their bright-gleaming arms as by their dress and order. The flames now enveloped the whole mansion. There was not a window or a It was a strange sight that ; and there were many persons who would, without doubt, have rather been snug by their own fireside than they would have re mained there ; but it happened that no one felt inclined to express his inclination to his neighbour, and, consequently, no one said anything on the subject. None would venture to go alone across the fields^where the spirit of the vampyre might, for all they knew to the contrary, be waiting to pounce upon them, and worry them. No, no; no man would have quitted that mob to go back alone to the village ; they would sooner have stood there all night through. That was an alternative that none of the number would very willingly accept. door from which the fiery clement did not burst forth in clouds, and forked flames came rushing forth with a velocity truly wonderful. The red glare of the flames fell upon aU objects around for some distance \u2014 the more especiaUy so as the sun had sunk, and a bank of clouds rose from beneath the horizon and excluded all his rays ; there was no twilight, and there was, as The hours passed away, and the house that had been that morning a noble and well-sornished mansion, was now a smouldering heap of ruins. The flames become somewhat subdued, and there was now more smoke than flames. The fire had exhausted itself. There Was now no more material that could serve it for fuel, and the flames began to become gradually enough subdued. Suddenly there was a rush, and then a bright flame shot upward for an instant, so bright and so strong, that it threw a flash of light over the country for miles ; but it was only momentary, and it sub sided. yet, no moon. The country side was enveloped in darkness, and the burning house could be seen for miles aronnd, and formed a rally ing point to all men's eyes. The engines that were within reach came tearing across the country, and came to the fire ; but they were of no avail. There was no supply of water, save from the ornamental ponds. These they could only get at by means that were tedious and unsatisfactory, considering the emergency of the case. The house was a lone one, and it was being entirely consumed before they ar rived, and therefore there was not the re motest chance of saving the least article. Had they ever such a supply of water, nothing could have been effected by it. Thus the men stood idly by, passing their remarks upon the fire and the mob.

In one place there were a number of people penetrating a path that only led toahedgo and a deep ditch ; indeed it was a brook very deep and muddy. Here they ca*v.e to a stop, and endea voured to ascertain its width, but the little reflected light they had was deceptive, and it did not appear so broad as it was. \"Ob, I can jump it,\" exclaimed one. \" And so can I,\" said another. \" I have done so before, and why should I not do so now ?\" I spot, watching the progress of that cle f ment, which has been truly described as a I very good servant, but a very bad master ; | and of the truth of this everyone must be well satisfied. There was now remaining little more than the livid glare of the hot and burning , embers ; and this did not extend far, for the walls were too strongly built to fail in from their own weight; they were strong and stout, and intercepted the little light the ashes would have given out. The mob now began to feel fatigued and chilly. It had been standing and walking about many honrs, and the ap- proach of exhaustion could not be put off much longer, especially as there was no excitement to carry it off. The officer, seeing nothing was to be done, collected his men together, and they were soon seen in motion. He had been ordered to stop any tumult that he might have seen, and to save any property. But there was nothing to do now ; all the pro ' perty that could have been saved was now destroyed, and tbe mob were beginning to I disperse, and creep towards their own I homes. The order was then given for the men i to take close order, and keap together, and tho word to match was given, which the ; men obeyed with alacrity, sor they had no good-will in stopping there tho whole of the night. The return to the village of both the . mob and the military was not without i'.s vicissitudes ; accidents of all kinds were i rife amongst them; the military, however, taking the open paths, soon diminished the distance, and that, too, with little or no accidents, save such as might have beeu expected from the state of the fields, after This was unanswerable, and as there were many present, at least a dozeu were eager to jump. \" If thee can do it, I know I can,\" said a brawny countryman ; \" so I'll do it at once.\" \" The sooner the better,\" shouted some one behind, \" or you'll have no room for a run, here's a lot of 'om coming up ; push over as quickly as you can.\" Thus urged, the jumpers at once made a rush to the edge of the ditch, and many jumped, and many more, from the prevail ing darkness, did not see exactly where the ditch was, and taking one or two steps too many, sound themselves up above the waist in muddy water.

Oh ! it's an UI wind that blows nobody any good !\" In one part ofthe field, where there were some stiles and gates, a big countryman caught a fat shop-keeper with the arms of the stile a terrible poke in the stomach ; while the breath was knocked out of the poor man's body, and he was gasping with agony, the fellow set to laughing, and said to his companions, who were of the same class \u2014 He immediately commenced feeUng for it, but had scarcely got his hand into his pocket when he found there would be a great difficulty in either pushing it in fur ther or withdrawing it altogether, for the pitch made it difficult to do either, and his pocket stuck to his hand like a glove. \"D\u2014 n it,\" said the grocer, \"who would have thought of that ? here's a pretty go. Curse that fellow, he is the cause of all this ; I'll be revenged on him, if it's a year hence.\" The enraged grocer drew his hand out bnt was unable to effect his object in with drawing the knife also ; but he saw some thing shining, he stooped to pick it up, ex claiming as he did so, in a gratified tone of voice \u2014 \" I say, Jim, look at the grocer, he hasn't any wind to spare. I'd run him for a wager; see how he gapes Uke a fish out of water.\" The poor shop-keeper felt indeed like a fish out of water, and he after-yards de clared he felt just as if he ha* had a red hot clock weight thrust into tho midst of his stomach and there left to cool. \"Ah, here's something that will do better.\" As he made a grasp at it, he found he had inserted his hand into someching soft. \" God bless me ! what now ?\" However, the grocer would be revenged upon his tormentor, who had now lost sight of him, but the fat man, after a time, recovering his wind, and the pain in his stomach becoming less intense, he gathered himself up. \" My name ain't Jones,\" he muttered, \"if I don't be one to his one for that ; I'U do something that shall make him re member what it is to insult a respectable tradesman. I'll never forgive such an insult. It is dark, and that's why it is he has dared to do this.\" He pulled his hand hastily away, and found that it stuck slightly, and then he saw what it was. \"Ay, ay, the very thing. Surely it must have been placed here on purpose by th* people.\" The fact was, he had placed his hand into a pot of pitch that had been left by the people who had been at work at pitch ing the pales, but had been attracted by the fire at Sir Francis Varney's, and to see which they had left their work, and the pitch was left on a smouldering peat fire, so that when Mr. Jones, the grocer, acci dentally put his hand into it he found it just warm. When he made this discovery he dabbed his hand again into the pitch-pot, ex claiming\u2014 \" In for a penny, in for a pound. And he endeavoured to secure as large a handsol of the slippery and stiekey stuff as he could, and this done he set off to come up with the big countryman who had done him so mueb indignity and made his stomach uncomfortable. He soon came up with him, for the man had stopped rather behind, and was lark ing, as it is called, with some men, to whom he was a companion. He had slipped down a bank, and was partially sitting down on the soft mud. In his bustle, the little grocer came down with a sUde close to the big countryman Filled with dire thoughts and a spirit of revenge, he looked from side to side to see with what he could effect his object, bnt could espy nothing. \" It's shameful, ' he muttered ; \" what would I give for a little retort. I'd plaster his ugly countenance.\" As he spoke, he placed his hands on some pales to rest himself, when he found that they stuck to them, for the pales had thirt day been newly pitched. A bright idea now struck him. \"If I could only get a handful of Ihis stuff,\" he thought, \" I should be able to 6erve him out for serving me out. I will, cost what it may ; I'm resolved upon that. I'll not have my wind knocked out, and my inside set on fire for nothing.

He cried out to bis companions that his eyes were pitched ; but they only laughed at him, thinking he was having some foolish lark with them. It was next day before he got home, for he wandered about all night ; and it took him a week to wash the pitch off by means of grease ; and ever afterwards he ree il lected the pitching of his face ; nor did he ever forget the grocer. Thus it was tbe whole party returned a long while after dark across the fields, with all the various accidents that were likely to befal such an assemblage of peof le.

What do you mean by that, you dog, eh ?\" \" Nothing ; only I can see without helps to read, or glasses either ; so I know one place from another.\" There was now some one moving within ; and the admiral, followed by Jack Pringle, entered the Hall. Henry Bannerworth was there. They were all ready to go when the coach came for them, which the admiral had ordered for them. ' Jack, you lubber ; where are you ?\" i urinq that very evening on which the house of Sir Francis Var ney was fired by the mob, another scene, and one of a different cha racter, was en acted at Ban nerworth Hall, where the own- era of that ancient place were departing from it. It was towards the latter part of the day, that Flora Bannerworth, Mrs. Banner worth, and Henry Bannerworth, were preparing themselves to depart from the house of their ancestors. The intended proprietor was, as we have already been made acquainted with, the old admiral ! who had taken the place somewhat mys- j teriously, considering the way in which he : usually did business. The admiral was walking up and down the lawn before the house, and looking up"], [247, "THE FEAST OF BLOOD. 239 \"Ay, ay, sir, here am I,\" answered Jack. \" Go, and station yourself up in some place where you can keep a good look-out for the coach, and come and report when you see it.\" \" Ay\u2014 ay, sir,\" said Jack, and away he went from the room, and stationed himself up in one of the trees, that commanded a good view of the main road for some dis tance. \" Admiral Bell,\" said Henry, \"here we are, trusting implicitly in you ; and in doing so, I am sure I am doing right.\" \" You will see that,\" said the admiral. \" All's fair and honest as yet ; and what is to come, will speak for itself.\" \" I hope you won't suffer from any of these nocturnal visits,\" said Henry. \" I don't much care about them ; but old Admiral Bell don't strike his colours to an enemy, however ugly he may look. No, no \u2014 it must be a better craft than his own that'll take him ; and one who won't run away, but that will grapple yard-arm and yard-arm, you know.\" \"Why, admiral, you must have seen many dangers in your time, and be used to all kinds of disturbances and conflicts. You have had a life of experience.\" \" Yes ; and experience has come pretty thick sometimes, I can tell you, when it comes in the shape of Frenchmen's broad sides.\" \"I dare say, then, it must be rather awkward.\" \" Death by the law,\" said the admiral \" to stop one of them with your head, I assure yeu. I dare not make the attempt myself, thongh I have often seen it done.\" \" I dare say ; but here are Flora and my mother.\" As he spoke, Flora and her mother en tered the apartment. \" Well, admiral we are all ready ; and though I may feel somewhat sorry at leav ing the old hall, yet it arises from attach ment to the place, and not any disinclina tion to be beyond the reach of these dread ful alarms.\" \" And I, too, shall be by no means sorry,' said Flora ; \" I am sure it is some gratifi cation to know we leave a friend here, rather than some others, who would have had the place, if they could have got it by any means.\" \" Ah, that's true enough, Miss Flora,\" said the admiral ; \" but we'll run the enemy down yet, depend on it. But once away, you will be free from these terrors ; and now, as you have promised, do not let yourselves be seen any where at all.\" \" You have our promises, admiral ; and they shall be religiously kept, I can assure you.\" \" Boat, ahoy\u2014 ahoy !\" shouted Jack. \"What boat?\" said the admiral, sur prised ; and then he muttered\u2014\" Con found you for a lubber ! Didn't I tell you to mind your bearings, you dog-fish, you ?\" \" Ay\u2014 ay, sir, and so I did.\" \"You did?\" \" Yes, here they are. Squint over the larboard bulk-head, as they call walls, and then atween the two trees on the star board side of the course, then straight ahead for a few hundred fathoms, when you come to a funnel as is smoking like the crater of Mount Vesuvius, and then in a line with that, on the top of the hill, comes our boat.\" \"Well,\" said the admiral, \" that'll do. Now go open the gates, and keep a bright look out, and if you see anybody near your watch, why douse their gum.\" \" Ay\u2014 ay, sir,\" said Jack, and he dis appeared. \" Rather a lucid description,\" said Henry, as he thought of Jack's report to the ad miral \" Oh, it's a seaman's report. I know what it means ; it's quicker and plainer than the land lingo, to my ears, and Jack can't talk any other, you see.\" By this time the coach came into the yard, and the whole party descended into the court-yard, where they came to take leave of the old place. \" Farewell, admiral.\" \" Good bye,\" said the admiral. \"I hope the place you are going to will be such as j will please you \u2014 I hope it will\" \" I am sure we shall endeavour to be pleased with it, and I am pretty sure we shall.\" \" Good bye.\" \" Farewell, Admiral Bell,\" said Henry. \"You remember your promises?\" \"I do. Good bye, Mr. Chillingworth.\" \"Good bye,\" said Mr. Chillingworth, who came up to bid them all farewell ; \" a pleasant journey, and may you all be the happier for it.\" \"You do not come with us?\" \"No; I have some business of impor tance to attend to, else I should have the greatest pleasure in doing so. But good bye ; we shall not be long apart, I dare say.\" \" I hope not,\" said Henry. The door of the carriage was shut by the admiral, who looked round, saying \u2014 \"Jack\u2014 Jack Pringle, where are you, you dog?\" \" Here am I,\" said Jack,"], [248, "238 VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE. J \" Where have you been to?\" \" Ouly been for the pigtail,\" said Jack. \" I forgot it, and couldn't set sail with out it.\" \" Hilloa ! take in sails and drop an- chor.\" \"Is this the place?\" \" Yes, here we are,\" said Jack ; \" we're in port now, at all events ;\" and he began to sing \u2014 \" You dog you! didn't I tell you to mind yonr bearings?\" \"So I wUl,\" said Jack, \" fore and aft- fore and aft, admiral.\" \" You had better,\" said the admiral, who, however, relaxed into a broad grin, which he concealed from Jack Pringle. Jack mounted the coach-box, and away it went, just as it was getting dark. The old admiral had locked up all the rooms in the presence of Henry Bannerworth ; and when the coach had gone out of sight, Mr. Chillingworth came back to the hal), where he joined the admiral. \" Well,\" he said, \" they aro gone, Ad- miral Bell, and we are alone ; we have a clear stage and no favour.\" \" The two things of all others I most desire. Now, they will fe strangers where they are going to, and that will be some thing gained. I will endeavour to do some thing if I get yard-arm and yard-arm with these pirates.

They at once entered a pretty garden, and then they came to a very neat and picturesque cottage. They had no time to look up at it, as the door was im mediately opened by an elderly female, who was intended to wait npon them. Soon after, Jack Pringle and the coach man entered the passage with the smaU amount of luggage which they had brought with them. This was deposited in the passage, and then Jack went out again, and, after a few minutes, there was the sound of wheels, which intima ted that the coach had driven off. Jack, however, returned in a few mi nutes afterwards, having secured the wicket-gate at the end of the garden, and then entered the house, shutting the door carefully after him. Flora and her mother looked over the apartment in which they were shown with some surprise. It was, in everything, such as they could wish; indeed, though it could not be termed handsomely or extra vagantly furnished, or that the things were new, yet there was all that convenience and comfort conld require, and some little of the luxuries. The coach in which the family of the Bannerworths were carried away, con- tinued its course without any let or hin- derance, and they met no one on their road during the whole drive. Tho fact was, nearly every one was at the conflagration at Sir Francis Varney's house. Flora knew not which way they were going, and, after a time, all trace of the road was lost. Darkness set in, and they all sat ir silence in the coach. At length, after some time had been spent thus, Flora Bannerworth turned to Jack Pringle, and said \u2014 \" Are we near, or have we much fur- ther to go ?\" \"Not very much, ma'am,\" said Jack. All's right, however\u2014 ship in the direct course, and no breakers a-head\u2014 no look- out necessary ; however, there's a land- lubber aloft to keep a look out.\" As this was not very intelligible, and Jack seemed to have his own reasons for silence, they asked him no further questions ; but in three-quarters of an hour, during which time the coach had been driving through the trees, they came to a stand-stiU by a sudden pull of the check-string from Jack, who said\u2014 \" Well,\" said Flora, \"this is very thoughtful of the admiral. The place wUl really be charming, and the garden, too, deUghtful.\" \" Mustn't be made use of just now,\" said Jack, \" if you please, ma'am, them's the orders at present.\" \" Very well,\" said Flora, smiling. \"I suppose, Mr. Pringle, we must obey them?\" \" Jack Pringle, if you please,\" said Jack. \" My commands only temporary.

There was not a breath of air stirring, and this circumstance added greatly to the impres sion of profound repose which the whole scene exhibited. HAPTER LVII, THE LONELY WATCH, AND THE AD- VENTURE IN THE DESERTED HOUSE. T is now quite night, and so peculiar and solemn a still- ness reigns in and about B a nnerworth Hall and its surrounding grounds, that onemighthave supposed it a place of the dead, deserted The wind during the day had been rather of a squally character, but towards night fall, as is often usual after a day of such a character, it had completely lulled, and the serenity of the scene was un roken even by the faintest sigh from a wandering zephyr. The moon rose late at that period, and as is always the case at that interval between sunset and the rising of that luminary which makes the night so beau tiful, the darkness was of the most pro- sound character. No. 31."], [250, "240 VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE ; OR, which gave it an air of dreary repose and listlessness. It was one of those nights to produce melancholy reflections \u2014 a night on which a man would be apt to review his past life, and to look into the hidden recesses of his soul to see if conscience could make a coward of him in tbe loneliness and still ness that breathed around. The shutters, too, were all closed, and that circumstance contributed largely to the production of that gloomy effect which otherwise could not have ensued. In fact what could be done without at tracting very special observation, was done to prove to any casual observer that the house was untenanted. It was one of those nights in which wanderers in the solitude of nature feel that the eye of Heaven is upon them, and on which there seems to be a more visible connection between the world and its great Creator, than upon ordinary occasions. But such was not really the case. Iu that very room where the much-dreaded Varney the vampyre had made one of his dreaded appearances to Flora Banner worth and her mother, sat two men. It was from that apartment that Flora had discharged the pistol, which had been left to her by her brother, and the shot from which it was believed by the whole family had most certainly taken effect upon the person of the vampyre. 1 1 was a room peculiarly accessible from the gardens, for it had long French win dows opening to the very ground, and but a stone step intervened between the floor ing of the apartment and a broad gravel wr. k which wonnd round that entire par tic n of the house. The solemn and melancholy appear places once instinct with life, when de serted by those familiar forms and faces that have long inhabited them. There is no desert no uninhabited isle in the far ocean, no wild, barren, pathless tract of unmitigated sterility, which could for one moment compare in point of loneliness and desolation to a deserted city. Strip London, mighty and majestic as it is, of the bosy swarm of humanity that throng its streets, its suburbs, its temples, its public edifices, and its private dwelUngs, and how awful would be the walk of one solitary man throughout its noiseless thoroughfares. If madness seized not upon bim ere he had been long the sole survivor of a race, he would need be cast in no common mould. It was in this room, then, that two men sa. in silence, and nearly in darkness. Before them, and on a table, were seve ral articles of refreshment, as well of de fence and offence, according as their in te . tions might be. There was a bottle and three glasses, and lying near the elbow of one of the men was a large pair of pistols, such as night have adorned the belt of some des p rate character, who wished to instil an < pinion of bis prowess into his foes by the magnitude of his weapons. Close at hand by the same party, lay some more modern fire-arms, as well as a long dirk, with a sUver mounted handle. The light they had consisted of a large I intern, so constructed with a sUde, that it could be completely obscured at a moment's notice ; but now as it was placed, the rays that were aUowed to come from it were directed as much from the window of the apartment as possible, and fell upon the faces of the two men, revealing them tobe Admiral BeU and Dr. ChiUingworth. It might have been the effect of the par ticular light in which he sat, but the doctor looked extremely pale, and did not appear at all at his ease. And to descend from great things to smaller \u2014 from the huge leviathan city to one mansion far removed from the noise and bustle of conventional life, we may imagine the sort of desolation that reigned through Bannerworth Hall, when, for the first time, after nearly a hundred and fifty years of occupation, it was deserted by the representatives of that family, so many members of which had lived and died be neath its roof. The house, and everything within, with out, and around it, seemed actually to sympathise with its own desolation and desertion. It seemed as if twenty years of con tinued occupation could not have pro duced such an effect upon the ancient edifice as had those few hours of neglect and desertion. And yet it was not as if it had been strippad of those time-worn and ancient reUcs of ornament and furnishing that so long had appertained to it. No, nothing but the absence of those forms which had been accustomed quietly to move from room to room, and to be met here upon a staircase, there upon a corridor, and even in some of the ancient panelled apartments, The admiral, on the contrary, appeared in as placable a state of mind as possible, and bad his arms folded across his breast, and his head shrunk down between his shoulders, as if he had made up his mind to something that was to last a long time,"], [251, "THE FEAST OP BLOOD. 241 and, therefore, he was making the best of it. lingworth, emphatically. \" You know, sir, that from the first time you broached that view of the subject to me, how entirely I coincided with you.\" \"Of course you did, for you aro a honest fellow, and a right-thinking fellow, though you are a doctor ; and I don't know that I like doctors much better than I like lawyers \u2014 they are only humbugs in a different sort of way.

I believe it runs, ' may the evening's amusement bear the morning's reflection.' \" \"Of course I'm much obliged, admiral, for your good opinion. I only wish it had struck me to bring something of a sohd nature in the shape of food, to sustain the waste of the animal economy during the hours we shall have to wait here.\" \"Don't trouble yourself about that,\" said the admiral. \" Do you think I'm a donkey, and would set out on a cruise without victualling my ship? I should think not. Jack Pringle will be here soon, and he has my orders to bring in some thing to eat.\" \"Well,\" said tbe doctor, \"that's very provident of you, admira1, and I feel per sonally obliged ; but tell me, how do you intend to conduct the watch?\" \" Transpose the devil !\" said the admi ral ; \" what do I care how it runs ?

It was one of the windows of a long i room, containing five, fronting the garden, which the admiral had left purposely un- guarded; and it was not far from thc 'apartment in which they had been sitting, so that, probably, not half a minute's time elapsed between thc moment of the first alarm, and their reaching tho spot from whence it was presumed to arise. The admiral had armed himself with \" Well, then, d e, if it comes to that\" said Mr. Chillingworth, \" wbat does be call here for?\" The admiral disdained an answer ; but demanding the lantern, he opened it, so that there was a sufficient glimmering of light to guide him, and then walked from the room towards the front door of the hall. one of the huge pistols, and he dashed forward, with all the vehemence of his character, towards the window, where he knew he had placed the family crockery, and where he fully expected to meet the reward of his exertion by discovering some one lying amid its fragments. In this, however, he was disappointed ; for, although there was evidently a great smash amonst tbe plates and dishes, the window remained closed, and there was no indication whatever of the presence of any one. He asked no questions before he opened it, because, no doubt, the signal was pre concerted ; and Jack Pringle, for it was he, indeed, who had arrived, at once walked in, and the admiral barred the door with the same precision with which it was before secured. \" Well, Jack,\" he said, \" did you see anybody?\" \" Ay, ay, sir,\" said Jack. \" Why, ye don't mean that \u2014 where?\" \" Where I bought tho grub ; a wo man \" \" Well, that's odd,\" said the admiral ; \" I balanced them up amazingly careful, and two of 'em edgeways \u2014 d e, a fly \u2022would have knocked them down.\" \" D e, you're a fool, Jack.\" \" You're another.\" \" Hilloa, ye scoundrel, what d'ye mean by talking to me in that way?

They come.\" \" What do you say they for ?\" said thei admiral. \"Death and the devil!\" said the ad miral, breaking from the grasp of Mr. Chil liDgworth. \"Ay,\" said Jack, \"you'll come to 'em both one of these days, old cock, and no mistake \" \"I'll have bis life, I'U have his Use!\" roared the admiral. \" Nay, nay, sir,\" said Mr. ChUlingwortb, catching the admiral round the waist. \" My dear sir, recollect, now, if I may venture to advise you, Admiral Bell, there's a lot of that fiery hollands, you know, in the next room ; set him down to tbat and finish him off.

They left the lamp outside the door, so that not even a straggling beam from it could betray tbat there were persons on the watch ; and then, as quietly as foot could fall, they took up their station among the hangings of the antique bedstead, which has been before alluded to in this work as a remarkable piece of furniture appertain ing to that apartment. \"Do you think,\" said the admiral, \"we've distanced them ?\" \" Go and do it, then ; for, as sure as you are a living man, his leg will be in in a minute.\" \" Here goes,\" said the admiral ; \" I never suggest anything which I'm unwil ling to do myself.\" Whoever it was that now was making such strenuous exertions to get into the apartment seemed to find some difficulty as regarded the fastenings of tbe window, and as this difficulty increased, the patience of the party, as well as his caution, deserted him, and the casement was rattled with violence. With a far greater amount of caution that any one from a knowledge of his character would have given him credit for, the admiral crept forward and laid himselt exactly under the window. The depth of wood-work from the floor to the lowest part of the window-frame did not exceed above two feet ; so that any one could conveniently step in from the balcony outside on to the floor of the apartment, whic'i was just what he who was attempting to effect an entrance was desirous of doing. It was quite clear that, be he who he might, mortal or vampyre, he had some acquaintance with the fastening of the window ; sor now he succeeded iu moving it, and the sash was thrown open. Tbe blind was still an obstacle ; but a vigorous pnll from the intruder brought that down on the prostrate admiral ; and then Mr. Chillingworth saw, by the moon light, a tall, gaunt figure, standing in the balcony, as if just hesitating for a moment whether to get head first or feet first into the apartment. Had he chosen tbe former alternative he would need, indeed, to have been endowed with more than mortal powers of defence and offence to escape capture, but his lucky star was in the ascendancy, and he put his foot in first. He turned his side to tbe aptrtment, and, as he did so, the blight moonlight full upon his face, enabling Mr. Chillingworth to see, without the shadow of a doubt, that it was, indeed, Varney, the vampyre, who was thus stealthily making his entrance into Bannerworth Hall, according to the calculation which had been made by the admiral upon that subject. Tne doctor scarcely knew whether to be pleased or not at this discovery ; it was almost a terrify ing one, sceptical as he wa3 upon the sub jectot vampyre*^, and he waited breathlessly for the issue of the singular! and peiilous adventure. \" Certainly we have. It's unlucky that the blind of the window was down.\" \"Is it ? By Heaven, there's a d \u2014 d strange-boking shadow creeping over it.\" Mr. Chillingworth looked almost with suspended breath. Even he could not altogether get rid of a tremulous feeling, as he saw that the shadow of a human form, apparently of very large dimensions, was on the outside, with the arms spread out, as if feeling lor some means of open ing tho window. It would have been easy now to have fired one of the pistols direct upon the figure ; but, somehow or another, both the admiral and Mr. Chillingworth shrank from that course, and they felt much rather inclined to captu re whoever might make his appearance, only using their pistols as a last resource, than gratuitously and at once to resort to violence. \" Who should you say that was ?\" whis peied the admiral. \" Varney, the vampyr*?.\" \"D e,he's ill-looking and big enough for anything \u2014 there's a noise I\" There was a strange cracking sound at the window, as if a pane of glass were being very stealthily and quietly broken ; and then the blind was agitated slightly, con fusing much the shadow that was cast upon it, as if the hand of some person were in troduced for the purpose of effecting a complete entrance into the apartment. \" He's coming in,\" whispered the ad miral. \"Hush, for Heaven's sake!\" said Mr. Cuillingworth ; \"you will alarm him, and we shaU lose the fruit of aU the labour we have already bestowed upon the matter ; but did you not say something, admiral, about lying under the window and catch ing him by the leg ?\" \" Why, yes ; I did.\" No doubt Admiral Bell deeply congra tulated himself upon the success which"], [255, "THE FEAST OF BLOOD. 245 was about to crown his stratagem sor the foot to come sufficiently near him to enable him to grasp it. His patience was not severely tried, for in another moment it rested full upon his chest. to take an advantage. What the devU's that?\" Something very large and very heavy came bang against the window, sending it all into the room, and nearly smother ing the admiral with fragments. Another shot was then fired, and in came some thing else, which hit tbe waU on the op posite side of the room, rebounding from thence on to the doctor, who gave a yeU of despair. \" Boarders a-hoy !\" shonted tbe admiral, and at once he laid hold of the trespasser. \"Yard-arm to yard-arm. 1 think I've got you now. Here's a prize, doctor ! he shall go away without his leg if he goes away now. Eh ! what ! the light \u2014 d \u2014 e, he has\u2014 Doctor, the light ! the light! Why what's this ? \u2014 Hilloa, there !\" Dr. Chillingworth sprang into the pas sage, and procured tbe light \u2014 in another moment he was at the side of the admiral, and the lantern slide being thrown back, he saw at once the dilemma into which his friend had fallen. After that all was still; the enemy seemed to be satisfied that they had si lenced the garrison, and it took the admi ral a great deal of kicking and plunging to rescue himself from some of the super incumbent mass that was upon him, which seemed to him to be a considerable sized tree. \" Call this fair fighting,\" he shouted\u2014 \" getting a man's legs and arms tangled up like a piece of Indian matting in the branches of a tree? Doctor, I say ! hiUoa! where are you?\" \" I don't know,\" said the doctor ; \" but there's somebody getting in at the balcony \u2014 now we shall be murdered in cold blood.\" There he lay upon his back, grasping, with the vehemence of an embrace that had in it mnch of the ludicrous, a long boot, from which the intruder had cleverly slipped his leg, leaving it as a poor trophy in the hands of his enemies. \" Why you've only pulled his boot off,\" said the doctor ; \" and now he's gone for good, for he knows what we're about, and has slipped through your fingers.\" Admiral Bell sat up and looked at the boot with a rueful countenance. \" Where's the pistols ?\" \"Fired off, of course ; yon did it yonr self.\" Bang came something else into the, room, which, from the sound it made closely resembled a brick, and after that somebody jumped clean into the centre of the floor, and then, after rolling and writhing about in a most singular manner, slowly got up, and, with various prelimi nary hiccups, said \u2014 \" Come on, you lubbers, many of you as Uke. I'm the tar for all weathers.'' \" Why, d\u2014e,\" said the admiral, \"it's Jack Pringle.\" \"Yes, it is,\" said Jack, who was not sufficiently sober to recognise the admiral's voice. \" I sees as how you've heard of me. Come on, all of you.\" \" Why, Jack, you scoundrel,\" roared the admiral, \" how came you here? Don't you know me ? I'm your admiral, you horse-marine.\" \" Eh ?\" said Jack. \" Ay\u2014 ay, sir, how came you here?\" \" Done again !\" he said. \" Yes, you are done,\" said the doctor ; \" why didn't you lay hold of the leg while you were about it, instead of the boot ? Admiral, are these your tactics ?\" \"Don't be a fool,\" said the admiral ; \"put out the light and give me the pistols, or blaze away yourself into the garden ; a chance shot may do something. It's no use running after him ; a stern chase is a long chase ; but fire away.\" As if some parties below had heard him give the word, two loud reports from the garden immediately ensued, and a crash of glass testified to the fact that some deadly missile had entered the room. \"Murder!\" said the doctor, and he fell flat upon his back. \" I don't like this at aU ; it's aU in your Une, admiral, but not in mine.\" \" All's right, my lad,\" said the admiral ; \"now for it.\" He saw lying in the moonUght the pis tols which he and the doctor had brought into the room, and in another moment he, to nsa his own words, returned the broad side of the enemy. \" How came you, you villain?\" \" Boarded the enemy.\" \" The enemy who you boarded was us; and hang me if 1 don't think you haven't been pouring broadsides into us, while the enemy were scudding before the wind in another direction.\" \" Lor !\" said Jack. \" Explain, you scoundrel, directly\u2014ex plain.\" \" D\u2014 n it,\" he said, \" this puts me in mind of old times.

You pull me, doctor, and I'll pull bim. Yo hoy!\" Jack laid hold of the admiral by the scuff of the neck, and tho doctor laid hold of Jack round the waist, the conse quence of whicb was that he was dragged out from the branches of thc tree, which seemed to have been thrown into the room, and down fell both Jack and tbe doctor. It may be well believed what a vast amount of surprise came over the three personages in that chamber, at the last little circumstance that had oc cured in connection with the night's pro ceedings. There ivas nothing which had preceded that, that did not resemble a genuine at tack upon the premises ; but about that last mysterious appearance, with its curious light, there was quite enough to bother the admiral and Jack Pringle to a considerable effect, whatever might be the effect upon Mr. Chillingworth, whose pro fession better enabled him to comprehend, chemically, what would produce effect-, that, no doubt, astonished them ama zingly. _ What with his intoxication, and the violent exercise he had taken, Jack was again thoroughly prostrate ; while the admiral could not have looked more as tonished had the evil onehimself appeared in pro-pria persona and given him notico to quit the premises. He was, however, the first to speak, and the words he spoke were addressod to Jack, to whom he said \u2014 At this instant there was a strange his sing sound heard below the window; then there was a sudden, loud report, as if a hand-grenade had gone off. A spectral sort of light gleamed into the room, and a tall, gauut-looking figure rose slowly up in the balcony. \"Beware of the dead I\" said a voice. \"Let the living contend with the living, the dead with the dead. Beware!\" The figure disappeared, as did also the strange, spectral-looking light. A death like stillness ensued, and the cold moon beams streamed in upon the floor of the apartment, as if nothing had occurred to disturb the wrapped repose and serenity of the scene. '.' Jack, you lubber, what do you think of all that?\" Jack, however, was too far gone even to say \u2014 \"ay\u2014 ay, sir;\" and Mr. Chilling worth, slowly getting himself up to his feet, approached the admiral. \" It's harl to say so much, Admiral BeU,\" ho said, \" but it strikes me th-."], [257, "VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE; OR, THE FEAST OF BLOOD. 247 whatever object this Sir FraLCis Varney, or Varney, the v ampyre, has in\" coming into Bannerworth Hall, it is, at all events, of sufficient importance to induce him to go any length, and not to let even a life to stand in the way of its accomplish ment\" J2i\"We)l, it seems so,\" said the admiral ; \"|for I'll be hanged if I can make head or tail ot the fellow.\" \" If we value our personal safety, we shall hesitate to continue a perilous ad venture, which I think can end only in de feat, if not in death.\" BANNERWORTH'S FATHER.

Just as he spoke, and before Jack Pringle could get half way over to the garden gate, there came a tremen dous ring at the bell which was sus pended over it. A view of that gate could not be com manded from tbe window of the haunted apartment, so that they could not see who it was that demanded admission. As Jack Pringle was going down, at any rate, they saw no necessity for per sonal interference ; and he proved that there was not, by presently returning with a note, which he said had been thrown over the gate by a lad, who then scampered off with all the speed he could make. The note, exteriorly, was well got up, and had all the appearance of great care having been bestowed upon its folding and sealing. It was duly addressed to \" Admiral Bell \u2014 Bannerworth Hall ;\" and the word \" immediate\" was written at one corner. \" What are you going to do ?\" inquired Mr. ChilUngworth. \" Accept his invitation, to be sure, and breakfast with him ; and, my learned friend, as he calls you, I hope you'll come likewise.

There, then, admiral, is the great mystery \u2014 what can he want at Ban nerworth Hall that makes him take sucb a world of tronble, and run so many fear ful risks in trying to get at it?\" \" Tbat is, indeed, the mystery ; and if he really means this invitation to breakfast, I shall ask him plumply, and tell him, at the same time, that possibly his very best way to secure hia object will be to be can did, vampyre as hs is.\" \"But reaUy, admiral, you do not still cling to that foolish superstition of be lieving that Sir Francis Varney is in reality a vampyre?\" \" I don't know, and I can't say ; if any body was to give me a description of a strange sort of fish that I bad never seen, I wouldn't take upon myself to say there wasn't such a thing ; nor wonld you, doctor, if you had really seen the many add ones that I have encountered at various times.\" OTWITHSTAND* ing all Mr. CWlUngworth could say to the contrary, the admiral really meant to breakfast with Sir Fran- cis Varney. The worthy doctor could not for some time believe but tbat tbe admiral must be joking, when he talked in such a strain; but he was very soon convinced to the contrary, by the latter actually walking out and once more asking him, Mr. ChiUingworth, if he meant to go with him, or not This was conclusive, so the doctor said \u2014 \"Well, admiral, this appears to me rather a mad sort of freak : but, as I have begun the adventure with yon, I wUl con clude it with you.\" \" That's right,\" said the admiral ; \" Pm not deceived in you, doctor; so come along. Hang these vampyres, I don't know how to tackle them myself. I think, after aU, Sir Francis Varney is more in your line than he is in mine.\" \" Well, weU, admiral, I'm certainly not belonging to that school of phUosophy which declares the impossible to be what it don't understand . there may be vam pyres, and there may be apparitions, for all I know to the contrary ; I only doubt these things, because I think, if they were true, that, as a phenomenon of nature, they would have been by this t ime established by repeated instances, without the possi bility of doubt or cavil.\" \" Well, there's something in that ; but how far have we got to go now?\" \" No further than yon enclosure where you see those park-like looking gates, and that cedar tree stretching its dark green foliage so far into the road *, that is Walmesley Lodge, whither you have been invited.\" \" How do you mean?\" \" Why, couldn't you persuade him he's dl, and wants some physic? Tbat would soon settle him, you know.'' \"Settle him !\" said Mr. ChiUingworth; \"I beg to say that if I did -tire him any physic, the dose would be mu h to his advantage ; but, however, my ot -in ion is, that this invitation to breakfast is, alter all, a mere piece of irony ; and ihnt, when we get to Walmesley Lodge, we shall not see anything of him ; on the contrary, we shall probably find it's a hoax.\" \"I certainly shouldn't like that, bat still it's worth the trying. The fellow has really behaved himself in such an extra ordinary manner, that if I can make terms with him 1 will ; and there's one thing, you know, doctor, that I think we may say we have discovered.\" \"And what may that be? Is it, not to make too sure of a vampyre, even when you have him by the leg.\" \"No, that ain't it, though that's a very good thiDg in its way; but it is just this, \" And you, my learned friend, recoUect that you were invited too ; so that you are no intruder upon the hospitality of Varney the vampyre.\" \" I say, admiral,\" said Mr. ChiUing worth, when they reached the gates, \" you know it is not quite the thing to call a man a vampyre at his own breakfast-table, so just oblige me by promising not to make any such remark to Sir Francis.\" \"A likely thing!\" said the admiral; \" he knows I know what he is, and he knows I'm a plain man and a blunt speaker;"], [261, "THE FEAST OF BLOOD. 251 however, I'll be civU to him, and more than that I can't promise. I must wring out ot him, if I can, what has become of Charles Holland, and what the deuce he really wants himself.\" The room into which they were shown was a longish, narrow one; a very wide door gave them admission to it, at the end nearest the staircase, and at its other ex tremity there was a similar door opening into some other apartments of the house. Sir Francis Varney sat with his back towards this other door, and a table, with some chairs and other articles of furniture, were so arranged before him, tbat while they seemed but to be carelessly placed in the position they occupied, they really formed a pretty good barrier between bim and his visitors. \" WeU, well ; come to no collision with bim, while we're his guests.\" \" Not if I can help it.\" The doctor rang at the gate bell of Walmesley Lodge, and was in a few mo ments answered by a woman, who demanded their business. \" Is Sir Francis Varney here?\" said the doctor. \u00bb \"Ob, ah ! yes,\" she replied; \"yon see bis house was burnt down for something or other\u2014 I'm sure I don't know what\u2014 by some people \u2014 I m sure I dont't know who \u2014 so, as the lodge was to let, we have took him in till he can suit himself.\" The admiral, however, was too intent npon getting a sight of Varney to notice any preparation of this sort, and he ad vanced quickly into the room. And there, indeed, was the much dreaded, troublesome, persevering, and sin gular looking being who had caused such a world of annoyance to the family of the Bannerworths, as well as disturbing the peace of the whole district, which had the misfortune to have him as an inhabitant. If anything, he looked thinner, taller, and paler than usual, and there seemed to be a sUght nervousness of manner about him, as he slowly inclined his head towards the admiral, which was not quite intelU gible. \"WeU,\" said Admiral BeU, \"you in vited me to breakfast and my learned friend ; here we are.\" \" No two human being?,\" said Varney, \" could be more welcome to my hospitality than yourself and Dr. ChiUingworth. I pray you to be seated. Wbat a pleasant thing it is, after thc toils and struggles of this life, occasionally to sit down in the sweet companionship of such dear friends. He made a hideous face as he spoke, and the admiral looked as if he were half inclined to quarrel at that early stage of the proceedings.\" \" Dear friends !\" he said ; \" well, well it's no use squabbUng about a word or two ; but I tell you what it is, Mr. Varney, or Sir Francis Varney, or whatever your d \u2014 d name is \" \" Hold, my dear sir,\" said Varney\u2014 \" aster breakfast, if you please\u2014 after \"Ah ! that's it, is it?\" said the admi ral , \"tell him that Admiral BeU and Dr. ChiUingworth are here.\" \"Very weU,\" said the woman; \"yon may walk in.\" \" Thank ye ; yon're vastly obUging, ma'am. Is there anything goiDg on in the breakfast line?\" \"Well, yes; I am getting him some breakfast, but he didn't say as ho expected company.\" The woman opened the garden gate, and they walked up a trimly laid out gar den to the lodge, which was a cottage-like structure in external appearance, although within it boasted of all the comforts of a tolerably extensive house. She left them in a small room leading from the hall, and was absent about five minntes ; then she returned, and, merely saying that Sir Francis Varney presented his compliments, and desired them to walk up 6tairs, 6he preceded them up a hand some flight, which led to the first floor of the lodge. Dp to this moment, Mr. ChiUingworth had expected some excuse, for, notwith standing all he had beard and seen of Sir Francis Varney, he could not believe that any amount of impudence would suffice to enable him to receive people as his guests with whom he must feel that he was at sucb breakfast.\" He rang a hand-beU as he spoke, and the woman who had charge of the house brought a tray tolerably covered with the materials for a sumptuous morning's meal. She placed it upon the table, and certainly the various articles that smoked upon it did great credit to her culinary powers. \"Deborab,\" said Varney, in a mild sort of tone, \"keep on continuaUy bnng- I ing things to eat until this old brutal sea positive war. It was a singular circumstance; and, perhaps, thc only thing that matched the cool impertinence of the invitation, was the acceptance of it under the circumstances by ths admiral. Sir Francis Varney might have intended it as a jest ; but if be did so, in the first instance, it was evident he would not aUow himself to be beaten with his own weapons."], [262, "VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE; OR, 252 not what they are. Only say you will fight, and that's sufficient.\" \" It is well,\" said Sir Francis Varney, in a solemn tone. ruffian has satiated his disgusting appe tite.\" The admiral opened his eyes an enor- mous width, and looking at Sir Francis Vamey, he placed his two fists upon the table, and drew a long breath. \" Did you address those observations to me,\" he said, at length, \"you blood- sucking vagabond ?\" \" Eh ?\" said Sir Francis Varney, look- ing over the admiral's head, as if he saw something interesting on the wall beyond. \" My dear admiral,\" said Mr. ChiUing- worth, \" come away.\" \"I'll see you d\u2014 d first !\" said the admiral. \"Now, Mr. Vampyre, no shuf- fling ; did you address those observations to me ?\" \"Deborah,\" said Sir Francis Varney, in the most silvery tones, \" you can remove this tray and bring on the next.\" \"Not if I know it,\" said the admiral. \u00ab I came to breakfast, and I'U have it ; after breakfast I'll pull your nose\u2014 ay, if you were fifty vampyres, I'd do it.\" \"Dr. ChiUingworth,\" said Varney, with- out paying the least attention to what the admiral said, \"you don't cat, my dear sir ; you must be fatigued with your night's exertions. A man of your age, you know, cannot be supposed to roll and tumble about like a fool in a pantomime with impunity. Only think what a calamity it would be if you were laid up. Your patients would aU get well, you \"i know.\" \"Nay, nay,\" interrupted Mr. Chilling worth ; \" this is boyish folly.\" \"Hold your row,\" said the admiral, \" and let's hear what he's got to say.\" \"In this mansion,\" said Sir Francis Varney \u2014 \"sor a mansion it is, although under the unpretending name of a lodge \u2014 in this mansion there is a large apartu.ent, which was originally fitted up by a 6cicn tifice proprietor of the place, for the pur pose of microscopic and other experimcuts, wbich required a darkness total and com plete, such a darkness as seems as if it could be filt\u2014 palpable, thick, and obsiure as the darkness of the tomb, and I know what that is.\" \" The devil you do !\" said the admiral. \"It's damp, too, ain't it ?\" \" The room ?\" \" No\u2014 the grave.\" \"Oh ! uncommonly, after autumnal rains. But to resume \u2014 this room is large, lofty, and perfectly empty.\" \" Well ?\" \" I propose that we procure two scythes.\" \"Two what?\" \" Scythes, with tbeir long handles, and their convenient holding places.\" \" Well, I'd be hanged ! What next do you propose ?\" \"You may be hanged. The next is, that with these scythes we be both of us placed in the darkened room, and the door closed, and doubly locked upon ns for one hour, and that then and there we do our best each to cut the other in two. If you succeed in dismembering me, you will have won the day ; but 1 hope, from my superior agility\" \u2014 here Sir Francis jumped upon his chair, and sat upon the back of it \u2014 \" to get the better of you. How do you like the plan I have proposed ? Does it meet your wishes?\" \" Curse your impudence !\" said the admiral, placing his elbows upon the table, and resting his chin in astonishment upon bis two bands. \"Sir Francis Varney,\" said Mr. Chil- Ungworth, \" we're your guests ; we come here at your invitation to partake of a meal. You have wantonly attacked both of us. I need not say that by so doing you cast a far greater slur upon your own taste and judgment than you can upon us.\" \" Admirably spoken,\" said Sir Francis Varney, giving his hands a clap together that made the admiral jump again. \"Now, old Bell, I'll fight you, if you think your self aggrieved, while the doctor sees fair play.\" \" Old who ?\" shouted the admiral. \" Bell, BeU \u2014 is not your name Bell ? \u2014 a family cognomen, I presume, on account of the infernsd clack, clack, without any sense in it, that is the characteristic of your race.\" \"Nay,\" interrupted Sir Francis, \"you challenged me ; and, besides, you'll have an equal chance, you know that. If you succeed in striking me first, down I go ; whereas, if I succeed in striking you first, down you go.\" As he spoke, Sir Francis Varney stretched out his foot, and closed a small bracket, which held out the flap of the table on which the admiral was leaning, and, accordingly, down the admiral went, tea-tray and all. \"You'U fight me?\" said the admiral, jumping up. \" Yes ; if you challenge me.\" \" By Jove I do ; of course.\" \"Then I accept it ; and the challenged party, you know well, or ought to know, can make his own terms in the encounter.\" \" Make what terms you please ; I care"], [263, "THE FEAST OF BLOOD. 253 Mr. Chillingworth ran to help him up, and, when they both recovered their feet, they found they were alone. \"TothedevU!\"saidtheadmiral. \"Who may Mr. Mortimer be ?\" There walked past the woman a stout, portly-looking man, weU-dressed, but with a very odd look upon hie face, in conse quence of an obliquity of vision, which prevented the possibflity of knowing which way he was looking. \" I must see him,\" he said ; \" I must see him.\" CHAPTER LXI.

He was unusually silent and reserved, and when he did speak, he felt rather in clined to turn the conversation upon in different topics, than to add anything more to what he had said upon tbe deeply interesting one which held so foremost a place in all their minds. \"How is Flora, now,\" he asked of Hemy, \"since her removal?\" \"Anxious still,\" said Henry ; \"but, I think, better.\" quence.\" \" I do not expect.

They passed again into the garden whicb they all knew so well, and then Henry paused and looked around him with a deep sigh.

My father, then, Admiral Bell, although a man not tainted in early life with vices, became, by the sorco of bad associates, and a sort of want of congeniality and sentiment that sprang up between him and my mother, plunged into all the excesses of his age. These excesses were all of that cha- racter which the most readily lay hold strongly of an unreflecting mind, because they all presented themselves in the garb of sociality. \" The wine cup is drained in the name of good fellowship ; money which is wanted for legitimate purposes is squan- dered under the mask of a free and noble generosity ; and all that the small ima- ginations of a number of persons of per- verted intellects could enable them to do, has been done, from time to time, to impart a kind of lustre to intemperance and all its criminal and dreadful conse- quences. \" My father, having once got into the company of what he considered wits and men of spirit, soon became thoroughly vitiated. He was almost the only one of the set among whom he passed what he considered his highly convivial existence, who was really worth anything, pecu- niarily speaking. There were some among them who might have been respectable men, and perchance carved their way to fortune, as well as some others who had Btarted in life with good patrimonies ; but he, my father, at the time he became associated with them, was the only one, as I say, who, to use a phrase I have heard myself from him concerning them, bad got I a feather to fly with. \" The consequence of this was, that his society, merely for the sake ofthe animal gratification of drinking at his expense, was courted, and he was much flattered, all ' of which he laid to the score of his own merits, which had been found out, and duly appreciated by these bon vivants, while he considered that the grave admo nitions of his real friends proceeded from nothing in the world but downright envy and malice. \" Such a state of things as this could not last very long. The associates of my father wanted money as weU as wine, so they introduced him to the gaming-table, an d he became fascinated with the fearful vice to an extent which predicted his own destruction and the ruin of every one who was in any way dependant upon him. \" He could not absolutely seU Banner- worth Hall, unless I had given him my consent, which I refused ; but he accu- mulated debt upon debt, and from time to time stripped the mansion of all its most costly contents. \" With various mutations of fortune, he continued this horrible and baneful career sor a long time, until, at last, he found himself utterly and irretrievably ruined, and he came home in an agony of des- pair, being so weak and utterly ruined in constitution that he kept his bed for many days. \" It appeared, however, that something occurred at this juncture which gave him actually, or, at aU events, awakened a hope that he should possess some money, and be again in a position to try his fortune at the gaming-table. \" He rose, and fortifying himself once more with the strong stimulant of wine and spirits, he left his home and was ab- sent about two months. \" What occurred to him during that time we none of us ever knew ; but late one night he came home, apparently much flurried in manner, and seeming as if something had happened to drive him half mad. \" He would not speake to any one, but he shut himself up the whole of the night in the chamber where hangs the portrait that bears so strong a resemblance to Sir Francis Varney, and there he remained till the morning, when he emerged, and said briefly that he intended to leave the country. ' He was in a most fearful state of ner vousness, and my mother tells me that he shook like one in an ague, and started at"], [268, "258 VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE; OR, \u2022very Uttle sound that occurred in the house, and glared about him so wildly that It was horrible to see him, or to sit in the lame apartment with him. \"She says that the whole morning passed on in this way tUl a letter came to him, the contents of which appeared to throw him into a perfect convulsion of terror, and he retired again to the room with the portrait, where he remained some hours, and then he emerged, looking like a ghost, so dreadfully pale and haggard was he. to know is he had left any disposition of his property ; but he got no information, and departed muttering the most diaboli cal oaths and curses tbat can be imagined. He mounted his horse, for he had ridden to the hall, and his last words were, as I am told \u2014 \" ' Where, in the name of all that's d \u2014 nable, can he have put the money?'\" \" And did you never find out who this man was?\" asked the admiral. \" Never.' \" It is an odd affair.\" \" He walked into the garden here, and was seen to sit down in this summer-house, and six his eyes upon the window of that apartment.\" Henry paused for a few moments, and then he added \u2014 \" It is,\" said Mr. Chillingworth, \" and full of mystery. The public mind was much taken up at the time with some other matters, or it would have made the death of Mr. Bannerworth the subject of more prolific comment thau it did. As it was, however, a great deal was said upon the subject, and the whole country was in a state of commotion for weeks after wards.\" \"You wiU excuse me from entering npon any details of what next ensued in this melancholy history. My father here committed suicide. He was found dying, and all the words he spoke were, 'The money is hidden !' Death claimed his victim, and, with a convulsive spasm, be resigned his spirit, leaving what he in tended to say hidden in the oblivion of the grave.\" \" That was an odd affair,\" said the ad miral. \" Yes,\" said Henry ; \" it so happened that about that very time a murder was committed in the neighbourhood of Lon don, which baffled all the exenions of the authorities to discover the perpetrators of. It was the murder of Lord Lome.\" \"Oh! I remember,\" said the admiral; \" the newspapers were full of it for a long time.\" \" It was, indeed. We have aU pondered deeply, and the result was, that, upon the whole, we were inclined to come to an op'nion that the words he so uttered were but the result of the mental disturbance that at snch a moment might weU be sup posed to be ensuing in his mind, and that they related really to no foregone fact any more than some incoherent words uttered by a man in a dream might be supposed to do.\" \" They were ; and so, as Mr. Chilling worth says, the more exciting interest which that affair created drew off public attention, in a great measure, from my father's suicide, and we did not suffer so much from public remark and from imper tinent curiosity as might have been ex pected.\" \" And, in addition,\" said Mr. Chilling worth, and he changed colour a little as he spoke, \"there was an execution shortly afterwards.\" \"It may be so.\" \"I do not mean,\" remarked Mr. Chil lingworth, \" for one moment to attempt to dispute, Henry, the rationality of such an opinion as you have just given utter ance to ; but you forget that another cir cumstance occurred, which gave a colour to the words used by your father.\" \" Yes ; I know to what you allude.\" \" Be so good as to state it to the ad miral.\" \"Yes,'' said Henry, \"there was.\" \" The execution of a man named Anger stein,\" added Mr. ChiUingworth, \" for a highway robbery, attended with the most brutal violence.\" \" True : all the affairs of that period of time are strongly impressed upon my mind,\" said Henry ; \" but you do not seem --vel\"., t*> :'.,-!!ip!--7crth?\" \" I will.

For one week, you say?\" \" Yes \u2014 for one week. I hope, by the end of that time, to have achieved some thing worth the telling you of; and I pro mise you that, if I am at all disappointed in my expectation, that I will frankly and freely communicate to you all I know and all I suspect\" \" Then that's a bargain.\" \" It is.\" \"Alter your position, then, and be blowed !\" cried Jack Pringle, suddenly stepping forward, and giving the doctor sucb a pusb, tbat he nearly went through one of the sides of the summer-house. \" Why, you scoundrel !\" cried the ad miral, \"how came you here?\" \"On my legs,\" said Jack. \"Do you think nobody wants to know nothing but yourself? I'm as fond of a yarn as any bodv.\" \" But if you are,\" said Mr. Chilling worth, \"you had no occasion to come against me as if you wanted to move a house.\" \"And what's to be done at once?\" \" Why, nothing, but to take the greatest possible care that Bannerworth Hall is not left another hour without some one in it; and in order that such should be the case, I have to request that you two will remain here until I go to the town, and make pre parations for taking quiet possession of it myself, which I will do in the course of t ivo hours, at most.\" \"Don't be longer,\" said the admiral, \" for I am so desperately hungry, that I shall certainly begin to eat somebody, if you are.\" \" Depend upon me.\" \"Very well,\" said Henry, \"you may depend we will wait here until you come back.\" \" You said as you wasn't in a position to say something as I wanted to hear, so I thought I'd alter it for you.\" \" Is this fellow,\" said tbe doctor, shak- ing his head, as he accosted tbe admiral, \" the most artful or stupid?\" \"A little of both,\" said Admiral Bell\u2014 \" a little of both, doctor.

Now, mind, I'll only give you a trial of another week or so, and if you don't be more purlite in your d n language, I'll leave you.\" Away strolled Jack, with his hands in his pockets, towards tbe house, while the admiral was half choked with rage, aud could only glare after him without the ability to say a word. Under any other circumstances than the present one of trouble and difficulty, and deep anxiety, Henry Bannerworth must have laughed at these singular little episodes between Jack and the admiral ; but his mind was now by far too much harassed to permit him to do so. \" Let him go, let him go, my dear sir,\" said Mr. Chillingworth to the admiral, The doctor at once hurried from the garden, leaving Henry and the admiral to amuse themselves as best they might, with conjectures as to what he was really about, until his return."], [270, "VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE; OR, 260 most important moments of a man's ex istence.\" Even as he spoke, he heard, from some j distance off, the sound of a short, quick j footstep. He bent forwards to Usten, and then, in a tone of satisfaction, he said\u2014 \" He comes \u2014 he comes !\" But he who thus waited for some con federate among these dim and old grey ruins, advanced not a step to meet him. On the contrary, such seemed the amount of cold-blooded caution which he possessed, that the nearer the man \u2014 who was evi dently advancing \u2014 got to the place, the further back did he who had precoded him shrink into the shadow of the dim and crumbling walls, which had, for some years now past, seemed to bend to the passing blast, and to be on the point of j yielding to the destroying hand of time. And yet, surely, he need not have been i so cautious. Who was likely, at such an hour as that, to come to the ruins, but one who sought it by appointment ? And, moreover, the manner of the ad vancing man should have been quite suffi cient to convince him who waited, that so much caution was unnecessary ; but it was a part and parcel of his nature. About three minutes more sufficed to bring tbe second man to the ruin, and he, at once, and fearlessly, plunged into its recesses. CHAPTER LXII. THE MYSTERIOUS MEETING IN THE KUIN AGAIN.\u2014 THE VAMPYRe's ATTACK UPON THE CONSTABLE. t is now neces- sary that we return once more to that mysterious ruin, in the intricacies of which Varney, when pursued S by the mob, ; had succeeded | in finding a \u25a0 refuge which defied all the exertions which were made for his dis covery. Our readers must be well aware, that, connected with that ruin, are some secrets of great importance to our story -, ami we will now, at the solemn hour of midnight, take another glance at what is doing within its recesses. At that solemn hour it is not probable that any one would seek that gloomy place from choice. Some lover of the pic turesque certainly might visit it ; but such was not the inciting cause of the pU grimage with those who were soon to stand within its gloomy precincts. Other motives dictated their presence in that spot\u2014 motives of rapine ; peradven ture of murder itself. \" Who comes ?\" said the first man, in a deep hollow voice. \" He whom you expect,\" was the reply. \" Good,\" he said, and at once he now emerged from his hiding-place, and they stood together in the nearly total darkness with which the place was enshrouded; for the night was a cloudy one, and there appeared not a star in the heavens, to shed its laint light upon the scene below. For a few moments they were both silent, for he who had last arrived had evidently made great exertions to reach the spot, and was breathing laboriously, while he wbo was there first appeared, from some natural taciturnity of character, to decline opening the conversation. At length the second comer spoke, say ing\u2014 As the neighbouring clocks sounded the hour of twelve, and the faint strokes were borne gently on the wind to that isolated ruin, there might have been seen a tall man standing by the porch of what had once been a large doorway to some portion of the ruin. His form was enveloped in a large cloak, which was of such ample material that he seemed well able to wrap it several times around him, and then leave a considerable portion of it floating idly in the gentle wind. He stood as still, as calm, and as mo tionless as a statue, sor a considerable time, before any degree of impatience began to show itself. Then he took from his pocket a large antique watch, the white face of which just enabled him to see what the time was, and, in a voice which had in it some amount of petulance and anger, he sjid \u2014 XT \" I have made some exertion to get here to my time, and yet I am beyond it, as I you are no doubt aware.\" '\u25a0 Yes, yes.\" \" Well, such would not have been the case ; but yet, I stayed to bring you some news of importance.\" \" Indeed '.\" \"It is so.

What do you now propose to do ?\" \" Nay, you are my privy councillor. Have you no deep-laid, artful project in hand ? Can you not plan and arrange something which may yet have the effect of accomplishing what at first seemed so very simple, but which has, from one un fortunate circumstance and another, be come full of difficulty and pregnant with all sorts of dangers?\" \" I must confess I have no plan.\" \" I listen with astonishment.\" \"The consequence is, that numerous arrests have taken place, and the places of confinement for offenders against the laws are now fuU of those whose heated and angry imaginations have induced them to take -.iolent steps to discover the reality or the falsehood of rumours which so much affected them, their wives, and their fami lies, that they feared to lie down to their night's repose.\" The other laughed a short, hollow, rest less sort of laugh, which had not one par ticle of real mirth in it. \"Go on\u2014 go on,\" he said. \"What did they do ?\" \" Immense excesses have been com mitted ; but what made me, first of all, stay beyond my time, was that I over heard a man declare his intentions this night, from twelve tiU the rooming, and for some nights to come, to hold wateh and ward for the vampyre.\" \"Indeed!\" \" Nay, now, you are jesting.'' \"When did you ever hear of me jesting?\" '' Not often, I admit. Bnt yon have a fertile genius, and I have always, myself, found it easier to be the executive, than to plan an elaborate course of action for others.\" \"Then you throw it aU on me.\" \" I throw a weight, naturally enough, upon the shoulders which I think the best adapted to sustain it.\" \" Be it so, then\u2014 be it so.\" \" You are, I presume, from what yon say, provided with a scheme of action which shall present better hopes of success, at less risk, I hope. Look what great danger we have already passed through.\" \" Yes, we have.\" \" I pray you avoid that in the next cam paign.\" \" It is not the danger which annoys and troubles me, but it is that, notwithstanding it, the object is as far off as ever from being attained.\" \" And not only so, but, as is invariably the case under such circumstances, we have made it more difficult of execution, because we have put those upon their guard thoroughly who are the most likely to op pose us.\" \u2022 \"We have \u2014 we have.\" \" Yes. He did but stay, at the earnest solicitation of his comrades, to take yet another glass, ere he came upon his expe dition.\" \" He mnst be met.

Let us retire further into the recesses of the ruiD, and there consider as well what is to be done regarding more important affairs, as with this rash intruder here.\" They both walked for some twenty paces, or so, right into the ruin, and then he who had been there first said, suddenly, to his companion \u2014 \" And placed the probabiUty o\u00a3 success afar off indeed.\" \" And yet I have set my Use upon the cast, and I will stand the hazard. I tell you I will accomplish this object, or I will perish in the attempt.\" \" You are too enthusiastic.\" \"I am annoyed, although the feeling reaches no further than annoyance, for I have a natural love of mischief, to think that my reputation ha3 spread so widely, and made so much noise.\" \" Your reputation as a vampyre, Sir Francis Varney, you mean ?\" \" Yes ; but there is no occasion for you \" Not at all.

It may be worth while to take some trouble with this pot-valiant fellow, and let him spread his news so as to stop any one else from being equally venturous and troublesome.\" \"A good thought.\" \" Shall it be done ?\" lours to the reader as the confidant and abettor of Sir Francis Var- ney, there had assembled on IIWI! ttat evening a curious and a gossiping party at the inn, where such dreadful and such riotous pro ceedings had taken place, which, in their proper place, we have already duly and at length recorded. It was not very likely that, on that evening, or for many and many an even ing to come, the conversation in the par lour of the inn would be upon any other subject than that of the vampyre. Indeed, the strange, mysterious, and horrible circumstances which had occurred, bade fair to be gossiping stock in trade for many a year. Never before had a subject presenting so many curious features arisen. Never, within the memory of that personage who is supposed to know everything, had there occurred any circumstance in the county, or set of circumstances, wbich afforded such abundant scope sor conjecture and speculation. Everybody might have his individual opinion, and be just as likely to be right as his neighbours ; aud the beauty of the affair was, that such was the interest of the subject itself, that there would be sure to be a kind of reflected interest with every surmise that at all bore upon it. On this particular night, when March dale was prowling about, gathering what news be could, in order that he might carry it to the vampyre, a more than usually strong muster ofthe gossips ofthe town took place. Indeed, all of any note in tho talki g way were there, with the exception of one, and he was in the county gaol, being one of the prisoners apprehended by the mili tary when they made the successful attack upon the lumber-room of the inn, after the dreadful desecration of the dead whieh \" Yes : il you will arrange that which shall accomplish such a result.\" \" Be it so. The moon rises soon.\" \" It does.\" \" Ab, already I fancy I see a brightening of the air as if the mellow radiance of the queen of night were already quietly dif fusing itself throughout the realms of space. Come further within the rujns.\" They both walked further among the crumbling waUs and fragments of columns with which the place abounded. As they did so, they paused now and then to listen, and more than once they both heard plainly the sound of certain footsteps immediately outside the once handsome and spacious building. Varney, the vampyre, who had been holding this conversation with no other than Marchdale, smiled as he, in a whis pered voice, told the lalter what to do in order to frighten away from the place the foolhardy man who thought that, by him self, he should be able to accomplish any thing against the vampyre. It was, indeed, a hair-brained expedi tion, sor whether Sir Francis Varney was reaUy so awful and preternatural a being as so many concurrent circumstances would seem to proclaim, or not, he was not a likely being to allow himself to be conquered by any one individual, let his powers or his courage be what they might. What induced this man to become so venturesome, we shall now proceed to re late, as well as what kind of reception he got in the old ruins, which, since the mys terious disappearance of Sir Francis Var ney within their recesses, had possessed so increased a share ot interest, and attracted so much popular attention and speculation. had taken place."], [275, "THE FEAST OF BLOOD. 265 Tbe landlord of the inn was likely to make a good thing of it, for talking makes people thirsty ; and he began to consider that a vampyre once a year would be no bad thing for the Blue LioD. \"It's shocking,\" said one of the guests; \" it's shocking to think of. Only last night, I am quite sure I had such a fright that it added at least ten years to my age.\" \" A fright !\" said several. \"I beUeve I speak English\u2014 I said a fright.\" \" Well, but had it anything to do with the vampyre?\" \"Everything.\" \" Oh ! do tell us ; do tell us all about it. How was it ? Did he come to you ? Go on. Well, well?\" The first speaker became immediately a very important personage in the room ; and, when he saw that, he became at once a very important personage in his own eyes likewise ; and, before he could speak another word, he filled a fresh pipe, and ordered another mug of ale. \" It's no use trying to hurry him,\" said one. the night,\" said one ; \"it puts one in mind of the rest of the world, and lets one know one isn't all alone.\" \" Very good. The striking of the clock I should not at all bave objected to ; but it was what foUowed that did the business.\" \"What\u2014 what?\" \" Fair and softly\u2014 fair and softly. Just hand me a light, Mr. Sprigs, if you please. I'll tell you all, geutlemen, in a moment or two.\" With the most provoking deliberation, the speaker relit his pipe, which had gone out while he was talking, and then, after a few whiffs, to assure himself that its contents had thoroughly ignited, he resumed \u2014 \"No sooner had the last sonnd of it died away, than I heard something on the stairs.\" \" Yes, yes?\" \"It was as if some man had given his soot a hard blow against one of the stairs; and he would have needed to have had a heavy boot on to do it.

I'll tell you in good time what a dreadful circumstance has made me sixty-three to-day, when I wos only fifty-three yesterday.\" \" Was it very dreadful?\" \" Rather. You wouldn't have survived it at all.\" \" How dreadful !\" \" It was. What to do I knew not, or what to think, except that the vampyre had, by some means, got in at the attic window, and was coming down stairs to my room. That seemed the most likely.

It is one thing to talk and to accept wagers in the snug parlour of an inn, and another to go alone across a tract of coun try wrapped in the profound stillness of night to an ancient ruin whicb, in addition to the natural gloom which might well be supposed to surround it, has superadded associations which are anything but of a pleasant character. Tom Eccles as he was named, was one of those individuals who act greatly from impulse. He was certainly not a coward, and, perhaps, really as free from supersti tion as most persons; but he was human, and consequently he had nerves, and he had likewise an imagination. He went to his house first before he started on his errand to the ruins. It wa3 to get a horse-pistol which he had, and which he duly loaded and placed in his great-coat, and with the air of a man quite determined upon something desperate, he left the town. \" Order, order.\" \"Let's hear the tale.\" \" Very good, gentlemen, I'll go on, if I ain't to be iuterrupted ; but I'll say this, that an illegitimate son is no son, in the eyes of the law ; or at most he's an acci dent quite, and ain't what he is, and so can't inherit.\" \"Well, that's what I call making mat ters plain,\" said one of the guests, who took his pipe from his mouth to make room for the remark ; \" now that is what I likes.\" \" Well, as I bave proved then,\" resumed the speaker, \"the nephew was the heir, and into the house he would come.

Poor things, they looked ruefully enough, and well they might, for there was a wide world for them, and no prospect of a warm corner. their inheritance, but for one trifling cir cumstance \u2014a mere ceremony. \" The night came on, and he had lights. True it was he had not been down stairs, only just to havo a look. He could not tell what sort of place it was ; there were a good many odd sort of passages, that seemed to end nowhere, and others that did. \" There were large doors \u2014 but they were all locked, and he had the keys\u2014 so he didn't mind, but secured all places that were not fastened. \"He then went up stairs again, and sat down in the room where the bureau was placed.

I see, somebody next door ; and if it wasn't, it don't matter. There's no body here. I'm alone, and there's plenty of valuables in the house. That is what I call very good company. I wouldn't wish for better.' \" Oh ! I don't believe,\" said another, \" that anything done that is dangerous, or supposed to be dangerous, by the bravest nun, is any way wholly without some un comfortable feelings. Tney may not be 6trong enough to prevent the thing pro posed to be done from being done, but they give a disagreeable sensation to the skin.\" \" He turned about, looked over room after room, and satisfied himself that he was alone \u2014 that the house was empty. \" At every room he entered he paused to think over the value \u2014 what it was worth, and that he was a very fortunate man in having dropped into such a good thing. \" ' Ah ! there's the old boy's secretary too \u2014 his bureau \u2014 there'll be something in that that will amuse me mightily ; but I don't think I shall sit up late.

' \" Those were hard knocks, I should say.\" \"They were, I assure you; but I lay there, and slept there, and won my wager.\" \" Would you do it again?\" \" No.\" \" With tbat he gave himself a 6hrug, as if some very uncomfortable seeling had come over him. \"'I'll go to bed early, and get some sleep, and then in daylight I can look after these papers. They won't be less interest ing in the morning than they are now.' \" There had been some rum stories about the old man, and now the nephew seemed to think he might have let the family sleep 'on the premises sor that night; yes, at that moment he could have sound it in his heart to have paid for all the expense of their keep, had it been possible to have had them back to remain the night. \" But that wasn't possible, for they would not have done it, but sooner have remained in the streets aU night than stay there all night, like so many house-dogs, employed by one who stepped in between them and their father's goods, which were \"And why not?\" \"Because of the rheumatism.\" \"You caught that?\" \" I did ; I would give ten times my wager to get rid of them.

He was terribly nervous, and shook so, he feared to fire the pistol ; but at length he did, and the report was fol lowed by a fall and a loud groan. \" This was very dreadful \u2014 very dread ful\u2014but all was quiet, and he lit the candle again, and approached the body to examine it, and ascertain if he knew who it was. A groan came from it. The bureau was open, and the figure clutched firmly a will in his hand. \"The figure was dressed in grave clothes, and he started up wheu he saw the form and features of his own uncle, the man who was dead, who somehow or other had escaped his confinement, and found his way up here.

Never mind, it will make a caU here again presently, and then I'll get through.' \" So saying he arose. Taking the can dle in his hand, he walked with a better step than might have been expected under the circumstance. True it was the candle wagged to and fro, and his shadow danced upon the wall ; but still, when he got to the bed, he secured his door, put the light in a safe place, threw himself down, and was fast asleep in a few moments, or rather he fell into a doze instantaneously. \"How long he remained in this state he knew not, but he was suddenly awakened by a loud bang, as though something heavy and flat had fallen upon the floor \u2014 such, sor instance, as a door, or anything of that sort.

Then, having come to this resolve, he strove might and main to banish from his mind those disagreeable reminiscences that had been oppressing him, to turn his attention to subjects of a different com plexion. During the progress of making this en deavour, which was rather futile, he came within sight of the ruins. Then he slack ened his pace a little, telling himself, with a pardonable self-deceit, that it was com mon, ordinary caution only which induced him to do so, and nothing at all in the shape of fear. \"Time enough,\" he remarked, \"to bo afraid when I see anything to be afraid of, which I don't see as yet So, as all's right, I may as well put a good face upon the matter.\" aut of the dis- tance being accomplished towards the old ruins, Tom Eccles be- gan to feel that wbat he had under- taken was not altogether such child's play as he had at first ima- gined it to be. Somehow or another, with a singular and uncomfortable sort of dis tinctness, there came across his mind every story that ho had remembered of the wild and the wonderful. All the long-since forgotten tales of superstition that in early childhood he had learned, came now back upon him, suggesting to his mind a thou sand uncomfortable fancies ofthe straDgest description. It was not likely tbat when once a man, under such circumstances, got into such a frame of mind, he would readily get out of it again, while he continued surrounded by such scenes as had first called them into existence. He tried to whistle a tune, but it turned out only a melancholy failure ; so he gave that up in despair, and walked on until he got within a hundred yards, or there abouts, of the old ruins. He thus proceeded, and bending his ear close to the ground, he listened atten tively for several minutes. Somehow, ho fancied that a strange murmuring sound came to his ears ; but he was not quite sure that it proceeded from the ruins, be cause it was just that sort of sound that might come from a long way off, being mellowed by distance, although, perhaps, loud enough at its source. \"Well, well,\" he whispered to himself, \" it don't matter much, after all. Go I must, and hide the handkerchiefs some where, or else be laughed at, besides losing my wagers. The former I don't like, and the latter I cannot afford.\" No doubt, had he turned about, and faced the inn again instead of the old ruins, he would soon have shaken off these \"thick coming fancies ;\" but such a result was not to be expected, so long as he kept on towards the dismal place he had pledged himself to reach. As lie traversed meadow after meadow, he began to ask himself some questions, which he found that he could not answer exactly in a consolatory manner, under the present state of things. Among these questions was the very pertinent one of \u2014 \"It's no argument against the existence of vampyres, be- cause I don't see the use of 'em \u2014 is it ?\" This he was compelled to answer as he bad put it ; and when, in addition, he began to recollect that, without the sha- dow of a doubt, Sir Francis Varney, the supposed vampyre, had been chased across the fields to that very ruin whither he was bound, and had then and there disappeared, be certainly found himself in a decidedly uncomfortable and most unpromising situ ation. Thns clinching the matter with such knock-down arguments, he walked on until he was almost within the very shadow of the ruins, and, probably, it was at this juncture that his footsteps may have been heard by Marchdale and Sir Francis Varney. Then he paused again ; but all was profoundly still, and he began to think the strange sort of murmuring noise which he heard must have come from afar off, and not at all from any person or persons within the ruins. \"Let me see,\" he said to himself; \"I have five handkerchiefs to hide among the ruins somewhere, and the sooner I do so the better, because then I will get away ; for, as regards staying here to watch, No,\" he said, \"no.

He then made to himself much the same remark that Sir Francis Varney had made THE VAMPYRE INTERRUPTS THE CONFERENCE IN THE SUMMERHOUSE. winning my wagers, to have the roofs that I had done so taken away by some chance visitor to the place.\" He at length saw a tolerably large stone, which stood, in a slant position, up against one of thc walls. Its size attacted him. He thought, if his strength was sufficient to move it, that it would be a good thing to Marchdale, with respect to the brighten ing np of the sky, in consequence of its being near the time for the moon to rise from the horizon, and he saw more clearly around him, although he could not find any good place to hide the handkerchiefs in. \"I must and will,\" he said, \"hide them securely *, for it would, indeed, be remark\" ably unpleasant, after coming here and to do so, and to place the handkerchiefs beneath it ; for at aU event\", it was so No. 35."], [282, "VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE ; OR, 272 not naturally suspicious ; but we cannot be too careful.\" heavy that it could not be kicked aside, and no one, without some soit of motive to do so, beyond the mere love of labour, would set about moving it from its posi tion. \" Oh ! certainly \u2014 certainly. The silver edge of the moon is now just peeping up from the east, and you will be able to see me well, if you step from the shadow of the wall by which you now are.\" This was a reasonable enough proposi tion, and Tom Eccles at once acceded to it, by stepping out boldly into the partial moonlight, which now began to fall upon the open meadows, tinting the grass with a silvery refulgence, aud rendering even minute objects visible. The moment he saw Marchdale he knew him, and advanc ing frankly to him, he said \u2014 \" I know you, sir, well.\" \" And what brings you here?\" \"A wager for one thing, and a wish to see the vampyre for another.\" \"Indeed!\" \" I may go further and fare worse,\" he said to himself; \"so here shall all the handkerchiefs Ue, to afford a proof that I have been here.\" He packed them into a small compass, and then stooped to roU aside the heavy stone, when, at the moment, before he could apply his strength to that purpose, he heard some one, in his immediate neighbourhood, say \u2014 Hist !'; This was so sudden, and so utterly un expected, that he not only ceased his ex ertions to move the stone, but he nearly fell down in his surprise. \"Hist \u2014 hist !\" said the voice again. \" What \u2014 what,\" gasped Tom Eccles \u2014 \" what are you?\" \"Hush \u2014 hush \u2014 hush !\" \" Yes ; I must own I have such a wish, along with a still stronger one, to capture him, if possible ; and, as there are now two of us, why may we not do it?\" \" As for capturing him,\" said Marchdale, \" I should prefer shooting him.\" \"You woold?\" The perspiration broke out upon his brow, and he leaned against the wall for support, as he managed to say, faintly \u2014 \" Well, hush\u2014 what then?\" \"Hist!\" \" I would, indeed, I have seen him once shot down, and he is now, I have no doubt, as well as ever.

At the instant Sir Francis Varney sprang forward, and made off at a rapid pace across the meadows. \" Fire after him\u2014 fire !\" tried March dale, \" or he will escape. My pistol has missed fire. He will be off.\" \"Well, I cannot but honour your scruples, although I do not actually share in them ; but I promise you tbat, since such is your wish, I will take no steps against the vampyre ; but let us come up to him and see if he be reaUy dead, or only badly wounded.\" Tom Eccles hun_r back a little from this proposal ; but, upon being urged again by Marchdale, and told that he need not go closer than he chose, he consented, and the two of them approached the prostrate form of Sir Francis Varney, which lay upon its face in the faint moonlight, which each moment was gathering strength and power. On the impulse of the moment, and thus urged by the voice and the gesture of his companion, Tom Eccles took aim as well as be could, and fired after the retreating form of Sir Francis Varney. His con science smote him as he heard the report and saw the flash of the large pistol amid the half sort of dark that was stUl around. The effect of the shot was then to him painfully apparent. He saw Varney stop instantly ; then make a vain attempt to stagger forward a little, and finaUy fall heavily to the earth, with all the appearance of one killed upon the spot. \" You have hit him,\" said Marchdale\u2014 \" you have hit him.

Come on.\" They halted within a couple of yajds of the body. Tom Eccles would not go a step further ; so Marchdale advanced alone, and pretended to be, with great re pugnance, examining for the wound. \"He is quite dead,\" he said; \"but I cannot see the hurt\" \"I think he turned his head as I fired.\" \" He seems finished.\" \" I beg your pardon there.

Marchdale followed him \" He moves\u2014 he moves !\" he cried. \" Look at the vampyre's body.\" Marchdale affected to look with an all- absorbing interest, and there was Sir Francis Varney, raising slowly one arm with the hand outstretched towards the moon, as if invoking that luminary to shed more of its beams upon him. Then the body moved slowly, like some one writhing in pain, and yet unable to move from the spot on which it lay. From the hoad to the soot, the whole frame seemed to he convulsed, and now and then as the ghastly object seemed to be gathering more strength, the limbs wore thrown ont with a rapid and a frightful looking violence. more slowly, and when he came up to him, he said \u2014 \" The slugs have taken effect on his face.\" \"I know it \u2014 I know it.

This was a state of things which con- ; tinued for many minutes, and then the body showed evident symptoms of so much returning animation, that it was about to rise from its gory bed and mingle once again with the living. \" Behold !\" said Marchdale, \" behold !\" \"Heaven have mercy upon us !\" |l \" It is as I said ; the beams of the moon have revived the vampyre.

We shall easily find some old stone in the ruins which wiU serve us for a seat, and there at leisure we can keep our eyes upon the dead body, and be able to observe if it makes the least move ment.\" Sir Francis Varney now, as if with a great struggle, rose to his feet, and looked up at the bright moon for some moments with 6uch an air and manner that it would not have required any very great amount of imagination to conceive that he was returning to it some sort of thanksgiving for the good that it had done to him. He then seemed for some moments in a state of considerable indecision as to which way he should proceed. He turned round several times. Then he advanced a step or two towards the house, but apparently his resolution changed again, and casting r his eyes upon the ruins, he at once made towards them.

It was evident that there was not between these ass dates the very best of feelings. Marchdale was always smart- ing under an assumption of authority over him on the part of Sir Francis Varney, whUe the latter scarcely cared to conceal any portion of the contempt with which he regarded his hypocritical companion. Some very strong bond of union, indeed, mnst surely bind these two strange persons together ! It must be something of a more than common nature which induces March- dale not only to obey the behests of his mysterious companion, but to supply him so readily with money as we perceive he promises to do. And as regards Varney, the vampyre, he, too, must have some great object in view, to induce him to run such a world of risk, and take so much trouble as he was doing with the Bannerworth family. What his object is, and what is the ob ject of Marchdale, will, now that we have progressed so far in our story, soon appear, and then much that is perfectly inex plicable wiU become clear and distinct, and we shall find that some human mo- tives are at the bottom of it aU. \"That would be weU.\" \" Good ; yonr prudence approves of the plan, and therefore it shaU be done.\" \" 1 am rather inclined to think,\" said Marchdale, with a shght tone ot sarcasm, \" that if my prudence did not approve of the plan it would stUl be done.\" \" Most probably,\" said Varney, calmly. \" Will you release him to-night ?\" \"It is morning, now, and soon the soft grey light of day will tint the east.

Of the two, vampyre as he L-*. we prefer him much to the despicable and hypocri tical Marchdale, who, under the pretence of being the friend of the Bannerworth famUy, would freely have inflicted npon them the most deadly injuries. It was quite clear that he was most dreadfuUy disappointed that Sir Francis Varsey would not permit him to take the life of Charles HoUand, and it was with a gloomy and dissatisfied air that he left the ruins to proceed towards the town, aster what we may almost term the altercation he bad had with Varney, the TampjTe, npon that subject. It must not be supposed that Sir Francis Varney, however, was blind to the danger which mnst inevitably accrue from per mitting Charles Holland once more to obtain his Uberty. What the latter would be able to state would be more than sufficient to convince the Bannerworths, and aU interested in their fortunes, that something was going on of a character which, however super natural it might seem to be, stiU seemed to have some human and ordinary objects for its ends. 1 At tbe solemn honr of midnight, whUe aU was still, that is to say, on the night succeeding the cne on wh.ch he had held the interview wi:h Marchdile we have re corded, Sir Francis Vamey alone sough: the si.ent ruins.

Had any one seen him, however, upon that evening, they would have or . an air of great doubt and irresolution upon his brow, as if he were struggling with some impulses which he sound it extremely difficult to res tain. \"I know well,\" he muttered, as he I among the shadow of the ruins, * that Marcbdale's reasoninz is cold and horribly correct, when he says there is danger in setting this youth free ; be: I am about to leave this place, and not to show myself for some time, and I cannot reconcUe myself to inflicting npon him the horror of a death by starvation, which must ensue.\" It was a night of more than usual dul ness, and as Sir Francis Varney removed the massy stone, which hid the narrow and tortuous entrance to the dungeons, a chilly feeling crept over him, and he co help supposing, that even then Marchdale might have played him false, and neglected to supply the prisoner food, according to his promise. Hastily he descended to the dungeons, an d with a step which had in it far less of cantion than had usuaUy characterized his proceedings, he proceeded onwards until he reached that particular dungeon in which our young friend, to whom we wished so well, had been so long confined from the beautiful and cheering light of day, and from aU that his heart's best auctions most cling to. \" Speak,\" said Sir Francis Varney, as he en.ered the dungeon. \" If the occupant of this dreary place live, let him answer one who is as mnch his friend as he ha been his enemy.'' \" I have no friend,\" said Charles Hoi-"], [288, "VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE. 278 land, faintly; \"unless it be one who would come and restore me to liberty.\" \"And how know yon that I am not he?\" \"Yonr voice sounds like that of one of my persecutors.

It was from her father, written in his last moments. It began with a curse and ended with a blessing. There was a postscript in another hand to say the old man died of grief. She read it by my tide on the quarter-deck. It dropped from her grasp, and she plunged into the sea. Jack Pringle went after her; but I never saw her again.\" \" Gracious Heavens ! what a tragedy.\" 'Yet, tolerable,\" said the old man. He arose and took his hat and placed it on his head.

Sir Francis walked rapidly until he came nearly to the outskirts of the town, and then he slackened his pace, proceed ing more cautiously, and looking carefuUy about him, as if be feared to meet any one who might recognise him. He had not proceeded far in this manner, when he became conscious of the cautious figure of a man gliding along in the oppo site direction to that which he was taking. A suspicion struck him, from the general appearance, that it was Marchdale, and if so, he wondered to see him abroad at such a time. Still he would not be quite cer tain ; but he hurried forward, so as to meet rhe advancing figure, and then his suspi cions were confirmed ; and Marchdale, with some confusion in his looks and manners, accosted him. generous, but it is better to be just first and that I consider means looking after one's self first I have a poniard here whicb will soon put an end to the trou bles of the prisoner in bis dungeon \u2014 its edge is keen and sharp, and will readily find a way to his heart.\" He walked on quite exultingly and caro lessly now, for he had got into the open country, and it was extremely unlikely that he would meet anybody on his road to the ruins. It did not take many minutes' sham walking now to bring him close to thespos whicb he intended should become such a scene of treacherous slaughter, and just then he heard from afar off something like the muttering of thunder, as if Heaven itself were proclaiming its vengeance against the man who had come out to slay one of its best and noblest creatures. \"Ab, Sir Francis Varney,\" he said, 'you are out late.\" \"Why, you know I should be out late,\" said Vamey, \" and you likewise know the errand upon which I was to be out.\" \" Ob, I recollect ; you were to release your prisoner.\" \"Yes, I was.\" \" What is that ?\" said Marchdale, shrink ing back a moment ; \" what is that \u2014an approaching storm '-.

I\u2014 I am glad yon have taken better thoughts of it.

He had not long to wait before he saw a bright flash of blue lightning, which sor one instant illumined the sky ; then by the time he conld have counted twelve there came the thunder whicb the flash preceded, and he felt terribly anxious to complete his enterprise, so that he might get back to the town and be safely housed before the storm, which was evidently approaching, should burst upon him. \"It is sweeping on apace,\" he said ; \"why did I not come earlier ?\" Even as be spoke he plunged among the recesses of the ruins, and searching about for the old stone which covered the en trance to the dungeon, he was surprised to find it rolled from its place and the aperture open. \" What is the meaning of this?\" he said ; \" how negUgent of Sir Francis Vamey; or perhaps, after all, he was only jesting with me, and let the prisoner go. If that should be the case, I am foiled indeed; but surely he could not be so fuU of indiscretion.\" Again came a dazzfing flash of light ning, which now, surrounded by the ruins as he was, made him shrink back and cover his eyes for a moment ; and then followed a peal of thunder with not half the duration of tune between it and the \"I know his object well. \"His craven spirit shrinks at tbe notion, a probable enough one, I wUl admit, that Charles Holland has recognised him,, and tbat, if once free, he would denounce him to the Bannerworths, holding him up to scorn in his true colours, and bringing down upon his head, perhaps, something more than detestation and contempt The viUain ! he is going now to take the life of the man whom he considers chained to the ground.

In vain he attempted to rise from his pros trate position.

It was not so, however, with Charles Holland, whose eyes had been now so long accustomed to the place that he could see in it as if a dim twilight irradiated it, and he at once, in his visitor, saw his worst foe, and not the man who had comparatively set him free. He was in a perfect agony, inasmuch as he considered that be would be allowed to remain there to starve to death, thus achieving for himself a more horrible death than any ho had ever thought of inflicting. \" Villain !\" exclaimed Charles Holland, \"you shall, there remain ; and, let you have what mental sufferings you may, you richly deserve them.\" He heedud not the cries of Marchdale\u2014 he heeded not his imprecations any more than he d id his prayers ; and the arch hypocrite u sod both in abundance. Charles was but too tiappy once more to look upon the open sky, although it was then in darkness, to heed anything that March- dale, in th t agony to which he was now reduced, might feel inclined to say ; and, after glancing around him for a sew moments, when he was free of the ruins, and inhaling: with exquisite delight the free air of the surrounding meadows, be saw by the twinkling of the lights in which direction the town lay, aud knowing that by taking a line in that path, and then after a time diverging a little to the right, he should come to Bannerworth HaU, he walked on, never in bis whole life, proba bly, feeling such an enjoyment of the mere fact of existence as at such a moment as that of e gquisite liberty. He saw, too, that the hand of his visitor grasped a weapon, winch Marchdale thought that, favoured by the darkness, he might carry openly in perfect security. \" Where are you ?\" said Marchdale ; \" I cannot see you.\" \"Here!\" said Charles, \"you may feel m7 griP >\" and he sprung upon him in an instant. The attack was so sudden and so utterly unexpected, that Marchdale was thrown backwards, and the dagger wrested from his grasp, during the first impulse which Charles HoUand had thrown into his attack. Moreover, his head struck with such violence against the earthen floor, tbat it produced a temporary confusion of his tiacalties, so that, bad Charles Holland been so inclined, he might, with Marchdale's own weapon, have easily taken his life. The young man did, on the impulse of the moment, raise it in his hand, but, on the impulse of another thought, he cast it from him, exclaiming \u2014 \"No.no ! not that ; I should be as bad as he, or nearly so.

Until Charles Holland actually had lest the strange, horrible, and cell-like place, he could scarcely make up his mind that the young man entertained a serious inten tion of leaving him there. Perhaps he did not think any one could be so cruel and so wicked as he himself ; for the reader will no doubt recollect that his, Marchdale's, counsel to Varney was to leave Charles Holland to his fate, chained down as he was in the dungeon, and that fate would have been the hoirible one of being starved to death in the course of a few days. When now, however, he felt confident that he was deserted \u2014 when he heard the sound of Charles Holland's retreating foot steps slowly dying away in the distance, untU not the faintest echo of them reached his ears, he despaired, indeed ; and the horror he experienced during the succeed ing ten minutes might be considered an ample atonement for some of his crimes.

This mode of proceeding was more fa vourable to reflection than the wild, rapid One which he had at first adopted, and in all the glowing colours of youthful and in genuous fancy did he depict to himself the surprise and the pleasure that would beam in the countenance of his beloved Flora, when she should find him once again by her side. Of course, he, Charles, could know nothing of the contrivances which had beeu resorted to, and which the reader may lay wholly to the charge of March dale, to blacken his character, and to make him appear faithless to the love he had professed. Had he known this, it is probable that indignation would have added wings to his progress, and he would not have been able to proceed at the leisurely pace he felt that his state of physical weakness dictated to him. And now he saw the topmost portion of Bannerworth Hall pushing out from amongst the trees with which the ancient pile was so much surrounded, aud the Sight of the home of bis beloved revived him, and quickened the circulation of the warm blood in his veins. But it was in vain. The chains \u2014 which had been placed upon Charles Holland during the first few days of his confine ment, when he had a little recovered from the effects of the violence which had been committed upon him at the time when he was captured \u2014 effectually resisted March dale. They even cut into his flesh, inflicting upon him some grievous wounds ; but that was all he achieved by his great efforts to free himself, so that, after a few moments, bleeding and in great pain, he, with a deep groan, desisted from the fruitless efforts he had better not have commenced. Then he remained silent for a time, but it was not the silence of reflection ; it was that of exhaustion, and, as such, was not likely to last long ; nor did it, for, in the course of another five minutes he called out loudly. \" I shall behold her now,\" he said, \"I shall behold her now ! A few minutes more, and I shall hold her to my heart that heart which has ever been hers \u2014 and which carried her image enshrined in its deepest recesses, even into the gloom of a dungeon !\" But let us, while Charles Holland is in dulging in these delightful anticipations anticipations which, we regret, in conse quence of the departure of tbe Banner worths from the hall, will not bo realised so soon as he supposes\u2014 look back upon the discomfited hypocrite and viUain, Marchdale, who occupies his place in the dungeon of the old ruins. Perhaps he thought there might be a remote chance that some one traversing the meadows would hear him ; and yet, if he had duly considered the mattor, which he was not in a fitting frame of mind to do, be would have recollected that, in choosing a dungeon among the underground vaults of these ruins, he had, by experiment, made certain that no cry, however loud, from where he lay, conld reach the upper air. And thus had this villain, by the"], [299, "THE FEAST OF BLOOD. 289 very precautions which he had himself taken to ensure the safe custody of another, been his own greatest enemy. \"Help! help! help!\" he cried, franti cally. Varney ! \u2014 Charles Holland ! have mercy upon me, and do not leave me here to starve ! Help, oh, Heaven ! Curses on all your heads\u2014 curses I Oh, mercy \u2014 mercy \u2014 mercy !\" In such like incoherent expressions did he pass some hours, until, what with ex haustion and a raging thirst that came over him, he could not utter another word, but lay the very picture ot despair and dis comfited malice and wickedness. the following little chivalric incident, which he told them he had himself collated from authentic sources : \u2014 \" The knight with the green shield,\" exclaimed one of a party of men at-arms, wbo were drinking together at an ancient hostel, not far from Shrewsbury \u2014 \"the knight with the green shield is as good a knight as ever buckled on a sword or wore spurs.\" \" Then how comes it he is not one of the victors in the day's tournament?\" ex claimed another. \"By the bones of Alfred !\" said a third, \"a man must be judged ot by his deserts, and not by the partiality of his friends. That's my opinion, friends.\" \" And mine, too,\" said another. \" That is all very true, and my opinion would go with yours, too ; but not in this instance. Though you may accuse me of partiality, yet I am not so ; for I have seen some of the victors of to-day by no means forward in the press of battle \u2014 men who, I will not say feared danger, but who liked it not so well but they avoided it as much as possible.\" \" Ay, marry, and so have L The reason is, 'tis much easier to face a blunted lance, than one with a spear head ; and a man may practice the one and thrive in it, but not the other ; for the best lance in the tournament is not always the best arm in the battle.\" CHAPTER LXIX.

She certainly enjoyed, npon her first re moval from Bannerworth Hall, greater serenity of mind than she had done there ; but, as we have already remarked of her, the more her mind was withdrawn, by change of scene, from the horrible consi derations which the attack of the vampyre had forced upon her, tbe more she reverted to the fate of Charles Holland, which was StUl shrouded in so much gloom. She would sit and converse with her mother upon that subject until she worked np her feelings to a most uncomfortable pitch of excitement, and then Mrs. Ban nerworth would get her younger brother to join them, who would occasionally read to her some compositions of his owd, or of some favourable writer whom he thought would amuse her. \" But how came he to be so easily over thrown to-day ? That speaks some thing.\" \" His horse is an old one.\" \"So much the better,\" said another; \" he's used to his work, and as cunning aa an old man.\" \" But he has been wounded more than once, and is weakened very much ; be sides, I saw him lose his sooting, else he bad overthrown his opponent\" \" He did not seem distressed about his accident, at all events, but sat contented in the tent.\" \" He knows well that those who know him will never attribute his misadventure either to the want of courage or conduct ; moreover, he seems to be one of those wbo care little for the opinion of men who care nothing sor him.\" \"Aud he's right. Well, dear comrades It was on the very evening when Sir Francis Varney had made up his mind to releaso Charles Holland, that young Ban nerworth read to his sister and his mother"], [300, "VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE; OK, 292 the health of the Green Knight, or the Knight of the Green shield, for that's his name, or the designation he chooses to go by.\" \" A health to the Knight with the Green Shield!\" shouted the men-at-arms, as they lifted their cups on high. \" Who is he?\" inquired one of the men- at-arms of him who had spoken favour- ably of the stranger. \" I don't know.\" \"And yet you spoke favourably of him but a few seconds back, and said what a brave knight he was!\" \"And so I uphold him to be ; bet, I tell you what, friend, I would do as much for the greatest stranger I ever met. I have seen him fight, where men and horses have bit the dust in hundreds; and that, in my opinion, speaks out for the man and warrior ; he who cannot, then, fight like a soldier, had better tilt at home in the castle-yard, and there win ladies' smiles, but not the commendation of the leader of the battle.\" \"That's true; I myself recollect very well Sir Hugh de Colbert, a very accom- plished knight in the castle-yard ; but his men were as fine a set of fellows as ever crossed a horse to look at, but they proved deficient at the moment of trial ; they were broken, and fled in a moment, and scarce one of them receive d a scratch.\" \" Then they hadn't stood the shock of the foeman?\" \" No, that's certain.\" \"But still I should like to know the knight \u2014 to know his name, very well.\" \" I know it not; he has some reason for keeping it secret, I suppose; but his deeds will not 6hame it, be it what it may. I can bear witness to more than one foeman fall- ing beneath his battle-axe.\" \" Indeed.\" \"Yes ; and he took a banner from the enemy in the last battle that was fought.\" \" Ab, well ! he deserves a better for- tune to-morrow.

She was the only daughter of the Earl de Cauci, a nobleman of some note ; be was one of an ancient and unblemished name, and of great riches. The lady was beautiful, but, at the same time, she was an unwilling bride, \u2014 every one could see that ; but the bridegroom cared not for that. There was a settled sorrow on her brow,\u2014 a sorrow that seemed sincere and lasting ; but she spoke not of it to any one,\u2014 her lips were seldom parted. She loved another. Yes, she loved one who was far away, fighting in the irars of his country,\u2014 one who was not SO rich in lands as her present bridegroom. When he left her, she remembered his promise ; it was, to fight on till he earned Ei fortune, or name that should give him some right to claim her hand, even from her imperious father. But, alas ! he came not ; and what could she do against the commands of one who would be obeyed? Her mother, too, was a proud, haughty woman, one whose sole anxiety was to increase the grandeur and power of her lionse by such connections. Thus it was pressed on by circumstances, she could no longer hold out, more espe cially as she heard nothing of her knight. She knew not where he was, or indeed if he were living or dead. She knew that he was never named. This last circum stance gave her pain ; for it assured her, hat he whom she loved had been unable to signalize himself from among other Ben. That, in fact, he was unknown n the annals of fame, as well as the probability that he had been slain in some )f the earlier skirmishes of the war. This, f it had happened, caused her some pain to hink upon ; not but such events were ooked upon almost with indifference by emales, save in such casea where their"], [301, "THE FEAST OF BLOOD. 291 affections were engaged, as on this occa sion. But the event was softened by the fact that men were continuaUy falling by the hand of man in such encounters, but at the same time it was considered an honourable and praiseworthy death for a soldier. He was mourned, but not with the anguish we now hear of ; for the friends were consoled by the reflection that the deceased warrior died covered with glory. \" None,\" repUed the maiden; \"And what does he bear by way of dis tinguishing himseff? What crest or device doth he bear?\" \" Merely a green shield.\" \" The unsuccessful knight in the tourna ment to day. Heavens 1 what can he de sire with me? He is not \u2014 no, no, it can not be \u2014 it cannot be !\" \"WUl you admit him, lady?\" \"Indeed, I know not what to do ; but yet he may have some inteUigence to give me. Yes \u2014 yes, admit him , but first throw some logs on the fire.\" The attendant did as she was desired, and then quitted the room sor the purpose of admitting the stranger knight with the green shield. In a few moments she could hear the stride of the knight, as he neared the apartment, and she thought the step was familiar to her ear \u2014 she thought it was the step of Sir Arthur Home, her lover. She waited anxiously to see the door open, and then the stranger entered. His form and bearing was that of her lover, but his visor was down, and she was unable to distinguish the features of the Bertha, however, was young, and as yet she knew not tbe cause of her absent knight's silence, or why he had not been heard of among the most foremost in tbe battle. \"Heaven's will be done!\" she ex claimed ; \" what can I do? I must submit to my father's behests ; but my suture life will be one of misery and sorrow.\" She wept to think of the past, and to dream of the future ; both alike were sorrowful to think upon \u2014 no comfort in the past and no joy in the future. Thus she wept and sorrowed on the night of the first tournament ; there was to be a second, and that was to be the grand one, where her intended bridegroom was to show himself off in her eyes, and take his part in the sport. * \u2022 \u2022 \u00bb stranger. His armour was such as had seen many a day's hard wear, and there were plenty of marks of the battle about him. His travel-worn accoutrements were altogether such as bespoke service in the field. \" Sir, you desired to see me ; say wherefore you do so, and if it be news you bring.\" The knight answered not hut pointed to the female attendant, as it he desired she would withdraw. \" You may retire,\" said Bertha ; \" be within call, and let me know if I am threa- tened with interruption.\" The attendant retired, and then the knight and lady were left alone. The former seemed at a loss how to break silence for some moments, and then he said \u2014 Bertha sat late\u2014 she sat sorrowing by the Ught of the lamps and tbe flickering flame of tbe fire, as it rose and fell on tbe hearth and threw dancing shadows on the walls. \" Ob, why, Arthur Home, should you thus be absent ? Absent, too, at such a time when you are more needed than ever. Alas\u2014 alas ! you may no longer be in the land of the Uving. Yonr family is great \u2014and your name known\u2014 your own has been spoken with commendation from the Ups of your friends; what more of fame do you need ? But I am speaking without purpose. Heaven have mercy on me.\" As she spoke, she looked up and saw one of her women in waiting standing *:. . ... \" Lady \" \"Ob, Heavens\u2014 'tis he!\" exclaimed Bertha, as she sprang to her feet, \" it is Sir Arthur Home!\" \"It is,\" exclaimed the knight, pulling up his visor, and dropping on one knee he encircled his arm round the waist of the lady, and at the same moment he pressed her lips to his own. The firtt emotion of joy and surprise over, Bertha checked her transports, and chid the knight for bis boldness. \" Nay, chide me not, dear Bertha ; I am what I was when I left you, and hope to find you the same.\" \" Am I not ?\" said Bertha. \"Well, what would you?\" \" My lady, there is one who wonld speak to you,\" said the hand-maiden. \"With me?\" \" Yes, my lady, he named yon the Lady Bertha de Cauci.\" \"Who and what is he?\" she inquired, with something like trepidation, of the maiden. \" I know not, my lady.\" \"But gave he not some token by which I might know who I admit to my chamber?\""], [302, "VARNEY, THE VAMPYR8; OK, 292 \"Truly I know not, for you seem more beauliful than you were then ; I hope that is the only change.\" \" If there be a change, it is only such as you see.

How is it I never heard your name mentioned, or that I re ceived no news from any one about you during the wars that have ended?\" \"I had more than one personal enemy, Bertha ; men who would have been glad to see me fall, and who, in default of that, would not have minded bribing an assassin to secure my death for them at any risk whatever.

What fortune have you met with since you left England?\" \"I was of course known but to few; among those few were the general under whom I served and my more immediate officers, who I knew would not divulge my secret.\" \"And they did not?\" \"No; they kept it nobly, and kept their eyes upon me in battle ; and I have reaped a rare harvest in fame, honour, and riches, I assure you.\" \"Thank Heaven!\" said Bertha. \u2022 \u2022 * * These two lovers parted for the present, after a protracted interview, Bertha to her chamber, and the Knight of the Green Shield to his tent. The following morning was one of great preparation ; the lists had been enlarged, and the seats made more commodious, for the influx of visitors bad been much greater than had been anticipated. Moreover, there were many old warriors '\u25a0 of distinction to be present, which made the Irridegroom look pale and feel uncom fortable as to the results of the tourna ment. The tilting was to begin at an early hour, and then the feasting and revelry would begin early in the evening, alter tho tilting bad all passed off.

The bridegroom tilted with several knights, and came off victorious, or without disadvantage to either. and Flora started from her seat in alarm. The cause of the alarm we shall proceed to detail. The green knight, on the contrary, tUted with but few, and always victorious, and such matches were with men who had been men of some name in the wars, or at least in the tilt-yard. The sports drew to a close, and when the bridegroom became the chaUenger,the Knight of the Green Shield at once rode out quietly to meet him. The encounter could not well be avoided, and the bride groom would wilUngly have declined the joust with a knight who had disposed of his enemies so easUy, and so uncere moniously as he had. The first encounter was enough ; the bridegroom was thrown to a great distance, and lay insensible on the ground, and was earried out of the field. There was an im mediate sensation among the friends of the bridegroom, several of whom rode out to challenge the stranger knight for his presumption. In this, however, they had misreckoned their chances, sor the challenged accepted their challenges with alacrity, and disposed of them one by one with credit to himself until the day was concluded. The stranger was then asked to declare who he was, upon which he Ufted his visor, and said \u2014 CHAPTER LXX. THE FUNEEAL OP THE 8TRANGEB OP THE INIT. \u2014 THE POPULAR COMMOTION, AND MES.

The populace were weU advertised of the fact, that the body of the stranger was to be buried that morning in their church yard ; and that, to protect the body, should there be any necessity for so doing, a large body of constables would be employed. There was no disposition to riot ; at least none was visible. It looked as if there was some event about to take place that was highly interesting to all parties, who were peaceably assembling to witness the inter ment of nobody knew who. The early hour at which persons were assembling, at different points, clearly in dicated that there was a spirit of curiosity about the town, so uncommon that none would have noticed it but for the fact of the crowd of people who hung about the streets, and there remained, Ustless and impatient. The inn, too, was crowded with visitors, and there were many who, not being blessed with the strength of purse that some were, were hanging about in the distance, wait ing and watching the motions ot those who were better provided. \" Ah !\" said one of the visitors, \" this is a disagreeable job in your house, land lord.\" \" Yes, sir ; I'd sooner it had happened elsewhere, I assure you. I know it has done me no good.\" \" I am Sir Arthur Home, and claim the Lady Bertha as my bride, by the laws of arms and those of love.\" Again the tent was fiUed, and again the hostelry was tenanted by the soldiery, who declared sor one side and then for the other, as the cups clanged and jingled together. \"Said I not,\" exclaimed one of the troopers, \" that the knight with the green shield was a good knight?\" \"You did,\" replied the other. \"And you knew who he was,\" said another of the troopers. \" Not I, comrades; I had seen him fight in battle, and, therefore, partly guessed how it would be if he had any chance with the bridegroom. I'm glad he has won the lady.\" It was trne, the Lady Bertha was won, and Sir Arthur Home claimed his bride, and then they attempted to defeat his claim ; yet Bertha at once expressed her self so strongly in his favour, that they were, however reluctantly, compelled to consent at last.

No traces of his body were found in the ruins.\" \" None. Oh ! he's escaped, there can be no doubt of that. I wish I had some fortune depending upon the fact ; it would be mine, I am sure.\" \"Nothing more likely,\" said the little old man. I can believe anything of a mob \u2014anything \u2014 no matter what\" The inn was crowded with visitors, and several extra hands were employed to wait upon tbe customers, and a scene of bustle and activity was displayed that was never before seen. It would glad tbe heart of a landlord, though ho were made ol stone, and landlords are usually of much more malleable materials than that. However, the landlord had hardly time to congratulate himself, for the bearers were come now, and the undertaker and his troop of death-following officials. There was a stir among the people, who began now to awaken from the lethargy that seemed to have come over them while they were waiting for the moment when it should arrive, that was to place the body under the green sod, against which so much of their anger had been raised. There was a decent silence that pervaded the mob of individuals who had assembled. Death, with aU its ghastly insignia, had an effect even upon the unthinking multi tude, who were ever ready to inflict death or any violent injury upon any object that came in their way\u2014 they never hesitated ; but even these, now the object of then hatred was no m re, felt appalled. 'Tis strange what a change comes over masses of men as they gaze upon a dead body. It may be that they all know that to that complexion they must come at last This may be the secret of the respect offered to the dead. \" Well, the lord keep us from vampyres and such-like cattle,\" said an old woman. \" I shall never sleep again in my bed with any safety. It frightens one out of one's life to think of it. What a shame the men didn't catch him and stake him !\" The old woman left the inn as soon as sbe had spoken this Christian speech. \"Humane!\" said a gentleman, with a sporting coat on. \" The old woman is no advocate sor half-measures !\" \" You are right, sir,\" said the landlord ; \" and a very good look ont she keeps upon the pot, to see it's full, and carefully blows the froth off !\" \" Ah ! I thought as much.\" \"How soon will the funeral take place, landlord ?\" inquired a person, who had at that moment entered the inn. \" In about an hour's time, sir.\" \u2022* Oh ! the town seems pretty full, though it is very quiet.

The tap-room was crowded, and there was no room for the men, aud they were taken into the kitchen, where they were seated, and earnestly at work, preparing bodily for the ceremony that had so shortly to be performed. \"Any better, Jacobs ?\" \"What do you mean ?\" inquired Jacobs, with a groan. \" It's news to me if I have been ill.\" \" Ob, yes, you were doleful up stairs, yon know.\" \"Ready, sir,\" said the round man, taking up his pint and finishing it off at a draught, at the same moment he thrust the remains of some bread and cheese into his pocket. Jacob, too, took his pot and having finished it with great gravity foUowed the example of his more jocose companion, and they all left the kitchen for the room above, where the corpse was lying ready for interment. There was an unusual bustle; everybody was on the tip-toe of expectation, and awaiting the result in a quiet hurry, and hoped to have the first glimpse of the coffin, though why they should do so it was difficult to define. But in this fit of mys terious hope and expectation they certainly stood. \" Will they be long?\" inquired a man at the door of one inside, \" wUl they be long beforo they come?\" \" They are coming now,\" said the man. \" Do you all keep quiet ; they are knock ing their heads against the top of the landing. Hark ! There, I told you so.\" The man departed, hearing something, and being satisfied that he had got some information. \" Now, then,\" said the landlord, \"move out of the way, and allow the corpse to pass out. Let me have no indecent con \u2022 duct ; let everything be as it should be.\" The people soon removed from the pas sage and vicinity of the doorway, and then the mournful procession\u2014 as the newspa pers have it\u2014 moved forward. They were heard coming down stairs, and thence along the passage, until they came to the street, and then the whole number of \" I've a proper regard sor my profession \u2014 that's the difference between you and me, you know.\" \" I'll wager you what you like, now, that I'll handle a corpse and drive a screw in a coffin as well as you, now, although you are so solid and miserable.\" \" So yon may \u2014 so you may.\" \" Then what do you mean by saying I haven't a proper regard for my profes sion?\" \" I say you haven't, and there's the thing that shall prove it \u2014 you don't look it, and that'3 the truth.\" attendants was plainly discernible. How different was the funeral of one who had friends! He was alone; none followed, save the undertaker and his attendants, all of whom looked solemn from habit and professional motives. Even the jocose man was as supernaturally solemn as could be well imagined ; indeed, nobody knew he was the same man. \"I don't look like an undertaker? In deed, I dare say I don't if I ain't dressed like One.\" \"Well,\" said the landlord, as he watched them down the street, as they slowly paced their way with funereal, not sorrowful solemnity, \" well, I am very glad that it is all over.\" \" Nor when you are,\" reiterated Jacobs. \"Why not, pray?\" \" Because you have always a grin on your face as broad as a gridiron\u2014 that's why.\" This ended the dispute, for the employer of the men suddenly put his head in, say ing\u2014 \" Come, now, time's up ; you are wanted up stairs, aU of you. Be quick ; we shall \" It has been a sad plague to you,\" said one. \"It has, indeed ; it must be to any one who has bad another such a job as this.

As yet all had been conducted with toler able propriety ; the funeral met with no impediment. The presence of death among so many of them seemed some check upon the licence of the mob, who bowed in sUence to the majesty of death. \" You may say that. There's no know ing what they will or won't do, confound them ! If they'd act like men, and pay for what they have, why, then I shouldn't care much about them ; but it dcn't do to have other people in the bar.\" \" I should think not, indeed ; that would alter the scale of your profits, I reckon.\" Who conld bear ill-will against him who was now no more? Man, while he is man, is always tie subject of hatred, fear, or love. Some one of these passions, in a modified state, exists in all men, and with such feelings they will regard each other ; and it is barely possible that any one should not be the object of one of these, and hence the stranger's corpse was treated with respect. In silence the body proceeded along the highway until it came to the churchyard, and followed by an immense multitude of people of all grades. The authorities trembled ; they knew not what all this portended. They thonght it might pass off \u2014 but it might become a storm first \u2014 they hoped and seared by turns, till some of them turned sick with apprehension. There was a deep silence observed by all those in the immediate vicinity of the coffin, but those further in the rear found full ex pression for their feelings. \"It would make aU the difference to me. Business,\" added the landlord, \" conducted on that scale, would become a loss ; and a man might as weU walk into a well at once.\" \" So I should say. Have many such occurrences as these been usual in this part of the country?\" inquired the stranger. ' Not usual at all,\" said the landlord ; \" but the fact is, the whole neighbourhood has run distracted about some superhuman being they call a vampyre.\" \"Indeed!\" \" Yes ; and they suspected the unfor tunate man who has been lying up-stairs, a corpse, for some days.\" \" Oh, the man they have just taken in the coffin to bury?'' said the stranger. \" Yes, sir, the same.\" \" Well, I thought perhaps somebody of great consequence had suddenly become defunct.\" \" Do you think,\" said an old man to another, \" that he wiU come to life again, eh?\" \" Oh, dear, no; it would not havecaused half the sensation ; people have been reaUy mad.\" \" Ob, yes, vampyres ahvays do, and lie in the moonlight, and then they came to life again. Moonlight recovers a vampyre to life again.\" \" And yet the moonlight is cold.\" \" Ab, but who's to tell what may happen to a vampyre, or what's hot or what's cold?\" \" It was a strange occurrence, altogether, I believe, was it?\" inquired the 6tranger. \"Indeed it was, sir. I hardly know the particulars, there have been so many tales afloat ; though they all concur in one point and that is, it has destroyed the peace of one famUy.\" \" Who has done so?\" \" Certainly not; oh, dear, no.\" \" And then they have permission to suck the blood of other people, to live them selves, and to make other people vampyres, too.\" \" The vampyre.\" \" Indeed ! I never heard of such an animal, save as a fable, before ; it seems to me extraordinary.\" \" So it would do to any one, sir, as was not on the spot, to see it; I'm sure I wouldn'r.\" \" The lord have mercy upon us !\" \"Ay, but they have driven a stake through this one, and he can't get in moon light or daylight ; it's all over \u2014 he's cer tainly done ; we may congratulate our selves on this point.\" \" So we may \u2014 so we may.\" They now neared the grave, the clergy man officiating as usual on such occasions. There was a large mob of people on all sides, with serious faces, watching the pro tress of the ceremony, and who Ustened in quietness. * * * In the meantime the procession, short as it was of itself, moved along in slow time through a throng of people, who ran out of their houses on either side of the way, and lined the whole length of the town. Many of these closed in behind, and"], [308, "VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE; OR, 298 There was no sign of any disturbance amongst the people, and the authorities were well pleased ; they congratulated themselves upon the quietness and order liness of the assemblage. The service was ended and the coffin lowered, and the earth was thrown on tho coffin-lid with a hollow sound. Nobody could hear that sound unmoved. But in a occasion. The crowd mado way for her, and gathered round her to see what was going to happen. \"Friend3 and neighbours,\" she said, \"can any of you relieve tbe tears ofa distressed, wife and mother ; have any of you seen anything of my husband, Mr. ChUlingworth ?\" \" What, the doctor i\" exclaimed one. \"Yes; Mr. ChiUingworth, the surgeon. He has not been home two days and a night. I'm distracted ! \u2014 what can have become of him I don't know, unless \" Here Mrs. ChiUingworth paused ; and some person said \u2014 \"Unless what, Mrs. Chillingworth? There are none but friends here, who wish the doctor well, and would do anything to serve him \u2014 unless what ? Speak out.\" \"Unless he's been destroyed by tho vampyre. Heaven knows what we may all come to ! Here am I and my children deprived of our protector by some means which we cannot imagine. He never, in all his life, did the same before.\" '* He must have been spirited away by some of thc vampyres. I'll tell you what, friend,\" said one to another, \" that some thing must be done ; nobody's safe in their bed.\" short while the sound ceased as the grave became fiUed; it was then trodden carefully down. There were no relatives there to feel affected at the last scene of all. They w ere far away, and according to popular belief upon the subject, they must have been dead some ages. * * * * * The mob watched the last shovelful of earth thrown upon the coffin, and witnessed the ramming down of the soil, and the heaping of it over at top to make the usual monument ; for all this was done speedily and carefully, lest there should be any tendency to exhume the body of the de ceased. The people were now somewhat relieved as to their state of solemnity and silence. They would all of them converse freely on the matter that had so long occupied their thoughts. They seemed now let loose, and every body found himself at liberty to say or do something, no matter if it were not very reasonable ; that is not always required of human beings who have souls, or, at least, it is unexpected ; and were it expected, the expectation would never be realized. The day was likely to wear away with out a riot, nay, even without a fiir ht ; a most extraordinary occurrence for such a place, undertheexistingeircumstances; for of late the populace, or, perhaps, the townspeople, were extremely pugnacious, and many were the disputes that were settled by the very satisfactory application of the knuckles to the head of the party holding a contrary opinion. Thus it was they were ready to take fire, and a hubbub would be the result of the slightest provocation. But, on the present occasion, there was a remarkable dearth of all subjects of the nature described. Who was to lead Israel out to battle ? Alas ! no one on the present occasion. Such a oae, however, appeared ; at least one who furnished a ready excuse for a disturbance. Suddenly, Mrs. Chillingworth appeared in the midst of a large concourse of peo ple. She had jast left her house, which was close at band ; her eyes red with weep ing, and her children around hor on this \" No, they are not, indeed. I think that all vampyres ought to be burned and a stake run through them, and then we should be safe.\" \"Ay, but you must destroy all those who are even suspected of being vampyres, or else one may do all tho mischief.\" \" So he might.\" \"Hurrah!\" 6bouted the mob. \"ChU lingworth for ever ! We'll find the doctor somewhere, if we pull down the whole town.\" There was an immense commotion among the populace, who began to start throwing stones, aud do all sorts of things without any particular object, and some, as they said, to find the doctor, or to show how wilUng they were to do so if they knew how. Mrs. ChiUingworth, however, kept on talking to the mob, who continued shout ing ; and the authorities anticipated an immediate outbreak of popular opinion, which is generaly accompanied by some forcible demonstration, and on this occa sion some one suggested the propriety of burning down Bannerworth Hall; because they had burned down the vampyre's house, aud they might aa well burn down that of the injured party, which was car ried by acclamation ; and with loud shouts they started on their errand. This was a mob's proceeding aU over,"], [309, "THE PEAST OP BLOOD. 299 and we regret very much to say, that it is very much the characteristic of English mobs. What an uncommonly strange thing it is that people in multitudes seem completely to get rid of all reason\u2014 all honour \u2014 aU common ordinary honesty; while, if you were to take the same people singly, you would find that they were rea sonable enough, and would shrink with a feeling quite approaching to horror from anything in the shape of very flagrant in justice. This can only be accounted for by a piece of cowardice in the human race, which induces them when alone, and act ing with the fuU responsibiUty of their actions, to shrink from what it is quite evident they have a full inclination to do, and wiU do when, having partiaUy lost their individuaUty in a crowd, they fancy, that to a certain extent they can do so with impunity. The burning of Sir Francis Varney's house, although it was one of those pro ceedings which wonld not bear the test of patient examination, was yet, when we take all the circumstances into considera tion, an act really justifiable and natural in comparison with the one which was now meditated. Bannerworth HaU had never been the residence even of any one who had done the people any injury or given them any offence, so that to let it become a prey to the flames was but a gratuitous act of mischief. worth HaU first, and so, perhaps, by letting the mob see that it was defended, induce them to give up the idea of its destruction on account of the danger attendant upon the proceeding by far exceeding any of the anticipated deUght of the disturbance. CHAPTER LXX1. THE STBANGB MEETING AT THE HALL BETWEEN MR. CHILLINGWORTH AND THE MYSTERIOUS FRIEND OF VABNET. hen we praise our friend Mr. ChUlingworth for not telling his wife where he was going, in pursuance of a caution and a discri- mination so highly credit able to him, we are quite certain that he haa no such excuse as regards the reader. Therefore we say at once that he had his own reasons now for taking up his abode at Bannerworth Hall for a time. These reasons seemed to be all dependant upon the fact of having met the mysterious man at Sir Francis Varney's ; and al though we, perhaps, would have hoped that the doctor might have communicated to Henry Bannerworth aU that he knew and all that he surmised, yet have we no doubt that what he keeps to himself he has good reasons for so keeping, and that his actions as regards it are founded upon some very just conclusions. He has then made a determination to take possession of, and remain in, Bannerworth Hall according to the full and free leave which the admiral had given him so to do. What results he anticipated from so lonely and so secret a watch we cannot say, but probably they will soon exhibit themselves. It needed no sort of extraordinary descri mination for any one to feel at once that not the least good in the way of an ambus cade was Ukely to be effected by such persons as Admiral Bell or Jack Pringle. They were aU very well when fighting should actually ensue, but they both wero certainly and remarkably deficient in diplomatic skill, or in that sort of patience which should enable them at all to compete with the cunning, the skill, the nice dis crimination of such a man as Sir Francis Varney. It was, however, or seemed to be, doomed, sor all who have had any expe rience in mobs must know bow extemely difficult it is to withdraw them from any impulse once given, especially when that impulse, as in the present instance, is of a violent character. \" Down with Bannerworth Hall !\" was the cry. \"Burn it\u2014 burn it !\" and aug mented by fresh numbers each minute, the ignorant, and, in many respects, ruffianly assemblage, soon arrived within sight of what had been for so many years the home of the Bannerworths, and whatever may have been the fault of some of tbat race, those faults had been of a domestic cha racter, and not at all such as would inter fere with the pubUc weal. The astonished, and almost worn-out authorities, hastily, now, after having dis posed of their prisoners, collected together what troops they could, and by the time the misguided, or rather the not guided at all populous, bad got half way to Banner worth Hall, they were being outflanked by eome of the dragoons, who, by taking a more direct route, hoped to reach Banner-"], [310, "VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE; OR, 300 aid of any artificial light whether any one was seeking concealment iu the place be sides himself. \"Night after night,\" he said, \"will I watch here until I have succeeded in un ravelling this mystery ; for that there is some fearful and undreamt of mystery at the bottom of all these proceedings I am well convinced.\" When he made such a determination as this, Dr. Chillingworth was not at all a likely man to bieak it, so there, looking like a modern statue in the arbour, he sat with his eyes fixed upon the balcony and the window of what used to be called Flora's room for some hours. If anything were to be done in that way it was unquestionably to be done by someone alone, who, like the doctor, would and conld remain profoundly quiet and await the issue of events, be they what they might and probably remain a spy and attempt no overt act which should be of a hostile character. This unquestion ably was the mode, and perhaps we should not be going too far when we say it was the only mode which could be with anything Uke safety relied upon as one likely to lead really to a discovery of Sir Francis Varney's motives in making such determined exertions to get possession of Bannerworth Hall. That night was doomed to be a very evemful one, indeed; for on it had Charles I Holland been, by a sort of wild impulsive I generosity of Sir Francis Varney, rescued ' from the miserable dungeon in which he I had been confined, and on that night, too, | he, whom we cannot otherwise describe than as the villain Marchdale, had been, in consequence of the evil that he himself meditated, and the crime with which he was quite willing to stain his soul, been condemned to occupy Charles's position. On that night, too, had the infuriated mob determined upon the destruction of Bannerworth Hall, and on that night was Mr. Chillingworth waiting with what patience he could exert, at the Hall, for whatever in the chapter of accidents might turn up of an advantageous character to that family in whose welfare and fortunes he felt so friendly and so very deep an interest. The doctor was a contemplative man, and therefore he did not so acutely feel the loneliness of his position as many persons would have done ; moreover, he was de cidedly not of a superstitious turn of mind, although certainly we cannot deny an imagination to him. However, if he really had harboured some strange fears and terrors tsiey would have been excusable, when we consider how many circumstances bad combined to make it almost a matter of demonstration that Sir Francis Varney was something more than mortal. What quantities of subjects the doctor thought over during his vigil in that garden it is hard to say, but never in his w hole life, probably, had he such a glorious oppor tunity for the most undisturbed contem plation of subjects requiring deep thought to analyze, than as he had then. At least he felt that since his marriage he had never been so thoroughly quiet, and left so com pletely to himself. It is to be hoped that he succeeded in settling any medical points of a knotty character that might be hovering in his brain, and certain it is tbat he had become quite absorbed in an abstruse matter con nected with physiology, when his ears were startled, and he was at once aroused to a full consciousness of where he was, and why he had come there, by tbe dis tant sound of a man's footstep. It was a footstep which seemed to be that of a person who scarcely thought it at all necessary to use any caution, and the doctor's heart leaped within him as in the lowest possible whisper he said to him self\u2014 Let us look, then, at the worthy doctor as he keeps his solitary watch. He did not, as had been the case when the admiral shared the place with him in the hope of catching Varney on that me morable occasion when he caught only his boot, sit in a room with a light and the means and appliances for making the night pass pleasantly away ; but, on the con trary, he abandoned the house altogether, and took up a station in that summer house which has before been mentioned as the scene of a remarkable interview be tween Flora Bannerworth and Varney the vampyre. Alone and in the dark, so that he could not be probably seen, he watched that one window of the chamber where the first appearance of the hideous vampyre had taken place, and which seemed ever since to be the special object of his attack. By remaining from twilight, and getting accustomed to the gradually increasing darkness of the place, no doubt the doctor was able to see well enough without the \" I am successful \u2014 I am successful It is believed now that the hall is deserted, and no doubt that is Sir Francis Varney come with confidence, to carry out his object in so sedulously attacking it, be that object what it may be.\" Elated with this idea, the doctor listened intently to the advancing footstep, which"], [311, "THE FEAST OF BLOOD. 301 position, from looking at the window, and commenced walking away from it, Mr. Chillingworth's mind was made up. It was not Varney\u2014 of that he felt now most positively assured, and could have no doubt whatever upon the subject. The gait, the general air, the walk, all were different; and then arose the anxious question of who could it be that had in truded upon that lonely place, and what could be the object of any one else but Varney the vampyre to do so. The stranger looked a powerful man, and walked with a firm tread, and, alto gether, he was an opponent that, had the doctor been ever so belligerently inclined, ' it would have been the height of indiscre tion for him to attempt to cope with him. each moment sounded more clearly upon his ears. It was evidently approaching from the garden entrance towards the house, and he thought, by the occasional deadened sound of the person's feet, be he whom he might, that he could not see his way very well, and, consequently, frequently strayed from the path, on to some of* the numerous flower-beds which were in the way. \"Yes,\" said the doctor, exultingly, \"it muBt be Varney ; and now I have but to watch him, and not to resist him ; for what good on earth is it to stop him in what he wishes to do, and, by such means, never wre6t his secret from him. The only way is to let him go on, and that wUl I do, most certainly.\" Now he heard the indistinct muttering of the voice of some one, so low that be could not catch what words were uttere l ; but he fancied that, in the deep tones, he recognised, without any doubt, the voice of Sir Francis Varney. \"It must he he,\" he said, \"it surely must be he. Who else would c me here to disturb the solitude of an empty house? He comes ! he comes !\" It was a very vexatious thing, too, for any one to come there at such a juncture, perhaps only from motives of curiosity, or possibly just to endeavour to commit some petty depredations upon the deserted building, if possible; and most heartily did the doctor wish that, in some way, he could scarce away the intruder. The man walked along very slowly, in deed, and seemed to be quite taking his time in making his observations of the building ; and this was the more provoking, as it was getting late, and if having pro jected a visit at all, it would surely soon be made, and then when he found no one there, of course, he would go. Amazed beyond expression, the doctor felt about on the ground at his feet, until he found a tolerably large stone, which he threw at the stranger with so good an aim, that it hit him a smart blow on the back, which must have been anything but a plea sant surprise. That it was a surprise, and that, too, a most complete one, was evident from the start which the man gave, and then he uttered a furious oatb, and rubbed his back, as he glanced about him to endeavour to ascertain from whence the missile had Now the doctor could see a figure emerge from behind some thick beeches, which had before obstructed his vision, and he looked scrutinizingly about, while some doubts stole slowly over his mind now as to whether it was the vampyre or not. The height was in favour of the supposi tion that it was none other than Varney ; but the figure looked so much stouter, that Mr. Chillingworth felt a little staggered upon the subject, and wholly unable to make up his mind upon it. The pausing of this visitor, too, opposite that window where Sii Francis Varney had made his attempts, was another strong reason why the doctor was inclined to believe it must be him, and yet he could net quite make up his mind upon the subject, so as to speak with certainty. A very short time, however, indeed, must have sufficed to set such a question as that at rest ; and patience seemed the only quali'y of mind necessary under those circumstances for Mr. Chillingworth to exert. come. \" I'll try him again with that, thought the doctor; \"it may succeed in scaring him away.\" And he stooped to search for another stone. The visitor continued gazing either at that window, or at the whole front of the house, for several minutes, and then he turned away from a contemplation of it, and walked slowly along, parallel with the windows of that dining-room, one of which had been broken so completely on the occasion of the admiral's attempt to take the vampyre prisoner. The moment the stranger altered his It was well that he did so at that precise moment; for before he rose again he heard the sharp report of a pistol, and a crash ing sound among some of the old wood work of which the summer-house was com posed told him that a shot had there taken effect. Affairs were now getting much too serious ; and, accordingly, Dr. Chil- Ungworth thought that, rather than stay"], [312, "VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE. 302 there to be made a target of, he would face the intruder. \" Doubt ? \u2014certainly not. What doubt can I have ?

' said the stranger, \"that voice; why, you are Dr. Chillingworth?\" \"I am; but I don't know you,\" said the doctor, as he emerged now from the sum niL-r-house, and confronted the stranger, who was within a lew paces of the entrance to it. \" Ay, that I am ; and I flung a stone at you, not knowing you, with a hope that you would be, by sucb means, perhaps, scared away, and so leave the coast clear for him.\" Then he started, as he added \u2014 \" Yes, 1 do know you, though.

The reader will, from what has been said, now readily recognise this man as Sir Francis Varney's mysterious visitor, to whon he gave, from some hidden cause or another, so large a sum of money, and between whom and Dr. Chillingworth a mutual recognition had taken place on the occasion when Sir Francis Varney lal, with such cool assurance, invited the admiral to breakfast with him at his new abode. \" Then you have an appointment with him ?\" \"By no means ; but he has made such repeated and determined attacks upon this house that the family who inhabited it were compelled to leave it, and I am here to watch him, ami ascertain what can possibly be his object.\" \"It is as I suspected, then,\" muttered this man. \" Confound him !

I had not married long\u2014 that is very long \u2014 for I have but one child, and she is not old, or of an age to know much more than what she might be taught ; sho is still in the course of education. I was early addicted to gamble ; the dice had iis charms, as all those that have ever engaged in play but too well know ; it is perfectly fascinating.\" \" So I have heard,\" said Mr. Chilling worth ; \" though, for myself, I found a wife and professional pursuits quite in compatible with any pleasure that either took time or resources.\" \" Ycu did, I must confess, to my most intense surprise.\" \" Yes, and yet you kept to me ; and, but that I respected you too much to allow you to do so, you would, from old associa tions, have countenanced me; but I could not, and I would not let you do so.

The story is a brief one, Mr. Chillingworth. I pray you be seated.' \" It is so. Would I had never entered one of those house3 where men are de prived of their money and their own free will, for at the gambling table you have no liberty, save that of gliding down the stream in company with others.

Yes, ruin, and ruin alone, can do this ; but alas ! 'tis then too late\u2014 thc evil is done. Soon alter my marriage, I fell in with a Chevalier St. John. Ile was a man ofthe world in every sense of the word, and one that was well versed in all the ways of society. I never met a man who was so perfectly ma'ter of himself, and of perfect ease and self confidence as he was. lie was never at a less, and, come what would, never betrayed surprise or vexation\u2014 two qualities, be thougln, that never ought to be shown by any man who moved in so ciety.\" \" Indeed.\" \"' Crrtainly not; you are free al ill-, to look on, play, or qnitthc plicc at any mo merit you please, and not bn noticed' pro- b.iSly by a single soul.' \"I arose, ami we walked backwards. having called one of tho men who wen waiting about, but who were w.itchersnn-l doorkeepers of the 'hell.' We were led along the passnge, and passed through thc pair of doors, which were well secured, and rendered tho poe ibility of a surpris. almost impossible. ' Iter tlic-o dark pi tees, we were suddenly let into a place when we were d.-zzlcd by the light and bril- liancy of the saloon. It was not so large as the one we left, but it was superior toil in all its appointments. \" At first I could not well see who was, or who was not, in the room where we were. As soon, however, as I found the use of my eyes, I noticed many well- dies. ed men, who were busily engaged in play, and who took no notice of any one who entered. Wre walked about for some minutes without speaking to any one, but merely looking on. I saw some men en- gnged in play ; some with earnestness, orliers again with great nonchalance, and money change 1 hands without the least remark. There were but few who spoke, and those only in play. Tiiere was a hum of conversation ; but you could not distinguish what was said, unless you paid some attention to, and were in close vici- nity with the individual who spoke. \"' Well,' said St. John, ' what do you think of this place?' \" ' Why,' I replied, ' I had no notion of seeing a place sited up as this is.' \"'No ; isn't it superb?' \"'It is beautifully done. They have many visitors,' said I, ' many more thai, I could have believed.' \"He was a strange man, a very strange man.\" \"Did he gamble?\" \"It is difficult to give you a correct and direct answer. I should say he did, and yet he never lost or won much; but I have often thought hewasmoio connected with those who did than was believed.\" \" Was.that a fact ?\" inquired Mr. Chil- lingworth. \" You shall see as we go on, and be able to judge sor yourself, i have thought he was. Well, he first took me to a band- some saloon where gambling was carried on. We had been to the opera. As we came out, he recommended that we should sup at a house where he wns well known, and where he was in the habit of spending his evenings after the opera, and before he retired. I agreed to this. I saw no reason why we should not. We went there, and bitterly have I repented of so doing ever since, and do to this day.'' \" Your repentance has been sincere and lasting,\" said Mr. Chillingworth ; \" the one proves the other.\" \" It does ; but I thonght not so then. The place was glittering, and the wine good. It was a kind of earthly paradise ; and when we had taken some wine, the chevalier said to me \u2014 \" ' Yes, they are all iota file players ; men of stamp and rank \u2014 none 01 youi seedy leg?, who have only what they can cheat you of.' \"'Ah !' \"'And, besides,' he addel, 'you may often form friendships hem that lea ; t fortune hereafter. 1 do not mean in play, ' because there is no necessity for your g doing so, or, if you do so, in going above a stake which you know won't hurt you.' tf \" 'Exactly.' \" ' Many men can never approach a table like this, and sit down to an hour's play, but, if they do, they must stake not omy more than they can afford, but ull their property, leaving themselves beggars.' \"'They do?' said I. \"'I am desirous of seeing a friend back wards ; he is at the hazaid table. Will you go with me?' \"1 hesitated. I feared to see the place where a vice was carried 00. I knew my self inclined to prudential motives I s.iid to him \u2014 'No, St. John, I'll wait here tor yon; it may be as well \u2014 the wine is good, and it will content me.' \"'Do so,' be said, smiling; 'but re member, I seldom or never play myself, nor is there any reason why you should.' \" 'I'll go, but I will uot play.'"], [316, "VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE; OR, 306 \" 'But men who know themselves, their resources, and choose to indulge for a time, may often come and lay the founda tion to a very pretty fortune.' \"' Do you see your friend?' I inquired. \"'No, I do not ; but I will inquire if he has been here, \u2014 if not, we will go. \"He left me fora moment or two to make some inquiry, and I stood looking at the table where there were sour players, and who seemed to be engaged at a friendly game ; and when one party won they looked grave, and when tho other party lost they smiled and looked happy. I walked away, as the chevalier did not return immediately to me; and then I saw a gentleman riso up from a table. He bad evidently lost. I wa3 standing by the seat, unconsciously holding the back in my hand. I sat down without thinking or without speaking, and sound myself at tbe hazard table. \" ' I will accompany you part of tho way home,' said I, ' and then I shall bave finished the night.' \" I did leave with him, and accom panied him home, and then walked to my own home. * * \u2022 * \" This was my first visit, and I thought a propitious beginning, but it was the more dangerous. Perhaps a loss might have effectually deterred me, but it is doubtful to tell how certain events might have been altered. It is just possible I might have been urged on by my desire to retrieve any loss I might have incurred, and so made myself at once the miserable being it took months to accomplish in bringing me to. \"1 went the day but one after this to meet the same individual at the gambling table, and played some time with varied success, until I left off with a trifling loss upon the night's play, which was nothing of any consequence. \" Thus matters went on ; I sometimes won and sometimes lost, until I won a few hundreds, and this determined me Jo play for higher stakes than any I had yet played for. \" 'Do you play, sir?' \" ' Yes,' I 6aid. I had hardly uttered tbe words when I was sorry for them; but I could not recall them. I sat down and play at once commenced. \"In about ten or fifteen minutes, often losing and then winning, I found myself about a hundred and twenty pounds in pocket, clear gain by the play. \"'Ah!' said the chevalier, who came up at that moment, ' I thought you wouldn't play?' \" ' I really don't know how it hap pened,' said I ; ' but I suddenly found myself here without any previous inten tion.\" \"It was no use going on in the pedling style I had been going on ; I had won two hundred and fifty pounds in three months, and had I been less fearful I might have had twenty-five thousand pounds. Ah ! I'll try my fortune at a higher game. \"Having once made this resolution, I was anxious to begin my new plan, which I hoped would have the effect of placing me far above my then present position in society, which was good, and with a little attention it would have made me an inde pendent man ; but then it required pa tience, and nothing more. However, the other method was so superior since it might all be done with good luck in a few months. Ah ! good luck ; how uncertain is good luck ; how changeful is fortune ; how soon is the best prospect blighted by the frosts of adversity. In less than a month I had lost more than I could pay, and then I gambled on for a living. \" My wife had but one child ; her first and only one ; an infant at her breast ; but there was a change came over her , for one had come over me\u2014 a fearful ono it was too \u2014 one not only in manner but in for tune too.

' Ruined !' \" ' You are not a loser, I hope?' \" ' Indeed I am not,' I replied; 'butnot much a gainer.' \" ' Nor need you desire to be. Do you desire to give your adversary revenge now, ortake another opportunity?' \" ' At another time,' I replied. \" ' You will find me here the day after to-morrow, when I shall be at your ser vice ;' then bowing, he turned away. \" ' He is a veiy rich man whom you have been playing with,' said the cheva lier. \"'Indeed.' \" ' Yes, and I have known him to lose sor three days together ; but you may take his word for any amount ; he is a perfect gentleman and man of honour.

It is a short word, but expressive.' \" ' No, no, we are not ruined. I know what you mean, you would say, we cannot live as we bave Uved ; we must retrench, and so we will, right willingly.' \" ' You must retrench most wonderfully,' I said, with desperate calmness, ' for the murder must out.' \" ' And so we will, but you will be with as ; you wiU not go out night after night, ruining your health, our happiness, and destroying both peace and prospects.' \"'No, no, Lizzy, we have no chance of recovering ourselves ; house and home \u2014 all gone\u2014 all, all.' \" ' My God I' she exclaimed. \" ' Ay, rail on,' said I ; ' you have cause enough ; but, no matter \u2014 we have lost all.' \" ' How\u2014 how 1\" \" ' Say no more, Lizzy ; if I can get a living elsewhere I will, but if not, I must get it there.' \" She seemed to be cast down at this, and she shed tears. I left the room, and again went to the gambling-house, and there, that night, I won a few pounds, which enabled me to take my wife and child away from the house they had so long lived in, and took them afterwards to a miserable place,\u2014 one room, where, in deed, there were a few articles of furniture tbat I had saved from the general wreck of my own property. \" She took things much less to heart than I could have anticipated ; sho seemed cheerful and happy, \u2014 she endeavoured to make my home as comfortablo as she could. \" Her whole endeavour was to make me, as much as possible, forget tho past. She wanted, as much as possible, to wean me away from my gambling pursuits, but that was impossible. I had no hope, no other prospect. \" ' It is useless to ask how ; I have done, and there is an end of the matter ; you shall know more another day \u2014 we must leave this house sor a lodging.' \"'It matters little,' she said ; 'all may be won again, if you will but say you will quit the society of those who have ruined you.' \" ' No one,' said I, ' has ruined me ; I did it ; it was no fault of any one else's ; I have not tbat excuse.' \" Thus she strove, but I could see each day she was getting paler, and more pale ; her figure, before round, was more thin, and betrayed sigis of emaciation. This preyed upon me ; and, when fortune de nied me ihe means of carrying homo that which she ao much wanted, I could never return for two days at a time. Then I would find her shedding tears, and sigh ing ; what could I say ? If I had any thing to take her, then I used to endea vour to make her forget that I bad been away. \" ' I am sure you can recover.' \" ' I may ; some day fortune will shower her favours upon me, and I live on in that expectation.' \" ' You cannot mean that you will chance the gaming-table ? for I am sure you must have lost all there.' \" ' I have.' \"'God help me,' she said ; 'you have done your child a wrong, but you may repair it' \" ' Never !' \" ' Ah !' she would exclaim, ' you will find me dead one of these days ; what you do now for one or two days, you will do by-and bye for many days, perhaps weeks.' \" ' Do not anticipate evil.' \" ' I cannot do otherwise ; were you in any other kind of employment but that of gambling,' she said, ' I should have some hope of you ; but, as it is, there is none.' \" ' Speak not of * ; my chances may turn out favourable yet, and you may be again as you were.' \" ' Never.' \" ' 'Tis a long day ! let me implore you, on my knees, to leave this place, and adopt some other mode of life ; we can be care ful ; a little will do, and we shall, in time, be equal to, and better than what we have been.' \" ' We never can, save by chance.' \" ' And by chance we never shall,' she replied ; ' if you will exert yourself we may yet retrieve ourselves.' \" 'And exert myself I will.' \" ' And quit thc gaming-table ?' \" ' Ask me to make no promises,' said I ; ' I may not be able to keep them ; therefore, ask me to make noDe.' \" ' I do ask you, beg of, entreat of you to promise, and solemnly promise me that you will leave that fearful place, where men not only lose all their goods, but the feelings of nature also.' \" ' But fortune is inconstant, and may change in my favour as much as she has done in others.' \" ' Fortune is indeed inconstant, but misfortune is as inconstant' \" ' You are prophetic of evil.' \" ' Ah !

I said, 'let her be awakened and partake of what I havo brought home.' \" With thatmy wife wakened her up, and the moment she opened her eyes she again began to cry for food, which I immediately gave her, and saw her devour with the utmost haste and hunger. The sight smote my heart, and my wife sat by watching, and endeavouring to prevent her from eating so fast. \"'This is bad,' I said. \" ' Yes, but I hope it may be the worst,' she replied, in a deep and hollow voice. \" ' Lizzy,' I exclaimed, ' what is the matter \u2014 are you ill?' \" 'Yes, very ill.' \"'What is the matter with you?

It is all sor them \u2014 all for them.' \"I thought that by continuing con stantly in one course, I must be at land at the ebb of the tide. ' It cannot always flow one way,' I thought.

However, fortune never seemed inclined to take the turn I had hoped for ; fortune was as far off as ever, and had in no case given me any opportunity of reco vering n.yself. \" A few pounds were the utmost I could at any time muster, and I had to keep up something of an appearance, and 6eem as if I had a thousand a year ; when, God knows, I could not have mustered a thou sandth part of that sum, were all done and paid lor. \"Day after day passed on, and yet no change.

I ought to have left off with that \u2014 to have been satisfied with such an amount of money ; but the demon of avarice seemed to have possessed me, and I went on and on with fluctuating fortune, until I lost the whole of it. \" I was fearful of the scene that awaited me.

I had always paid, and thought my word would be taken for once; and, if I won, all well and good; if not, then I was no worse off than before. \" I went on the other side of the bed to look at her face, and some misgivings overtook me.

Will you not consult your safety by flight?\" \"No,\" said Mr. Chillingworth's com panion ; \" we prefer remaining here at tho risk even of whatever danger may accrue to ns.\" \"I can. Thc wild and lawless mob whicb you and your friends first induced to interfere in affairs far beyond their or your control, are now flushed with the desire of riot and of plunder.

He only wants to have the hall to himself.\" \" Can that be possible ? The Banner worth family are the sufferers from all that has happened, and not the inflictors of suffering.\" \" Ay, be it so ; but he who once raises a mob has raised an evil spirit, whicb, in the majority of cases, it requires a far more potent spell than he is master of to quell again.\" \" It is so. That is a melancholy truth ; but you address me, Sir Francis Varney, as if I led on the mob, when in reality 1 have done all that lay in my power, from the very first moment of their rising on account of this affair, wbich, in the first instance was your work, to prevent them from proceeding to acts of violence.\" \"It may be so ; but if you have now any regard for your own safety you wiU quit this place. It will too soon become the scene of a bloody contention. A large party of dragoons are even now by another route coming towards it, and it will be their duty to resist the aggressions of the mob ; then should the rioters persevere, you can guess the result.\" \"I can, indeed.\" There could be no doubt now of the im mediate appearance of the cavalry, and, before Sir Francis Varney could utter ano ther word, a couple of the foremost of the soldiers cleared the garden fence at a part where it was low, and alighted not many feet from the summer-house in which this short colloquy was taking place. Sir Francis Varney uttered a bitter oath, and immediately disappeared in the gloom. \" What shaU we do ?\" said the hang man. \"You can do what you like, but I shall avow my presence to the military, and claim to be on their side in the approach ing contest, if it should come to one, which I sincerely hope it will not\" The military detachment consisted of about twenty-five dragoons, who now were all in the gardens. An order was given by the officer in command for them to dis mount, which was at once obeyed, and the horses were frstened by their bridles to the various trees with which the place abounded. \" They are going to oppose the mob on soot, with their carbines,\" said the hang man, \" there will be sad work here, I am afraid.\" \"Retire then while you may, and against the bad deeds of Sir Francis Var ney at all events place some of his good \" Well, at aU events,\" said Mr. Chilling-"], [323, "THE FEAST OF BLOOD. 313 worth, \" I shaU decline acting the part of a spy here any longer ; so here goes.\" \" Hilloa ! a friend, \u2014 a friend here, in the summer-house !\" \"Hurrah! hurrah!\" shouted the mob. \" down with the vampyre ! down with the hall !\" and then one, more candid than his fellows, shouted \u2014 \" Down with everything and every body !\" \" Ah !\" remarked the officer ; \" that fel low now knows what he came about.\" \" Make it two friends,\" cried the hang man, \" if you please, whUe you are about it.\" A couple of the dragoons immediately appeared, and the doctor, with his com panion, were marched, as prisoners, before the officer in command. A great number of torches and Unks were lighted by the mob, but the moment the glare of light fell upon the helmets and accoutrements of the military, there was a pause of consternation on the part of the multitude, and Mr. Adamson, urged on by the officer, who, it was evi dent, by no means liked the service he was on, took advantage of the opportunity, and, stepping forward, he said \u2014 \" My good people, and fellow townsmen, let me implore you to Usten to reason, and go to your homes in peace. If you do not, but, on the contrary, in defiance of law and good order, persist in attacking this house, it will become my painful duty to read the riot act, and then the military and you will have to fight it out together, which I beg you will avoid, for you know that some of you wdl be killed, and a lot more of you receive painful wounds. Now disperse, let me beg of you, at once.\" There seemed for a moment a disposition among the mob to give up the contest, but there were others among them who were infuriated with drink, and so regardless of all consequences. Those set up a shout of \" Down with the red coats ; we are Eng lishmen, and wUl do what we like.\" Some one then threw a heavy stone, which struck one of the soldiers, and brought blood from bis cheek. The officer saw it, but be said at once \u2014 \"What do you do here ?\" he said. \"I was informed that the hall was deserted. Here, orderly, where is Mr. Adamson, the magistrate, who came with me ?\" \" Close at hand sir, and he says he's not well.\" \" Well, or ill, he must come here, and do something with these people.\" A magistrate of the district who had accompanied the troops, and been accom modated with a seat behind one of the dra goons, which seemed very much to have disagreed with him, for he was as pale as death, now stepped forward. \"You know me, Mr. Adamson ?\" said the doctor ; \" I am Mr. Chillingworth.\" \" Oh ! yes ; Lord bless you ! how came you here ?\" \" Never mind that just now ; you can vouch for my having no connexion with the rioters.\" \" Ob, dear ! yes ; certainly. This is a respectable gentleman, Captain Kichard son, and a personal friend of mine.\" \" Oh 1 very good.\" \" And I,\" said the doctor's companion, \"am likewise a respectable and useful member of society, and a great friend of Mr. Chillingworth.\" \" Well, gentlemen,\" said the captain in command, \" you may remain here, if you like, and take the chances, or you may leave.\" They intimated that they preferred re maining, and, almost at the moment that they did so, a loud shout from many throats announced the near approach of \"Stand firm, now, stand firm. No anger \u2014 steady.\" \"Twenty pounds for the man who threw that stone,\" said the magistrate. \" Twenty pound ten for old Adamson, the magistrate,\" cried a voice in the crowd, which, no doubt, came from him who had cast the missile. Then, at least fifty stones were thrown, some of which hit tbe magistrate, and the remainder came rattling upon the helmets of the dragoons, Uke a hail shower. \" 1 warn you, and beg of you to go,\" said Mr. Adamson ; \" for the sake of your wives and families, I beg of you not to pursue this desperate game.\" Loud cries now arose of \" Down with the soldiers; down with the vampyre. He's in Bannerworth HaU. Smoke him out !\" And then one or two links were hurled among the dismounted dragoons. AU this was put up with patiently ; and the mob. \" Now, Mr. Magistrate, if you please,\" said the officer ; \" you wUl be so good as to tell the mob that I am here with my troop, under your orders, and strongly advise them to be off while they can, with whole skins, lor if they persevere in attack ing the place, we must persevere in defend ing it ; and, if they have half a grain of sense among them, they can surely guess what the result of that will be.\" \" I wiU do the best I can, as Heaven is my judge,\" said the magistrate, \" to pro duce a peaceable result,\u2014 more no man can do.\""], [324, "VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE; OR, 314 then again the mob were implored to leave, wbich being answered by fresh taunts, the magistrate proceeded to read the riot act, not one word ot which was audible amid the tumult that prevailed. me of Flora, if you would not bave me die at once of suspense, and all the torture of apprehension.\" \"She lives and is well,\" answered Mr. Chillingworth. \" Thank Heaven !

Take me into the house. Good God ! why is it made a point of attack ? Where are Flora and Henry ? Are they all well ? And my uncle ! Oh ! what must you all have thought of my absence ! But you cannot have endured a hundredth part of what I have suffered. Let me look once again upon the face of Flora. Take me into the house.\" \" Put out all the lights,\" cried a voice among the mob. The order was obeyed, and the same voice added ; \"they dare not fire on us. Come on ;\" and a rush was made at the garden wall. \"Make ready \u2014 present,\" cried the offi cer. And then he added, in an under tone, \" above their heads, now \u2014 fire !\" There was a blaze of light for a moment, a stunning noise, a shout of dismay from the mob, and in another moment all was Still. \" I hope,\" said Dr. Chillingworth, \" that this is, at all events, a bloodless victory.\" \" You may depend upon that,\" said his companion ; \" but is not there some one yet remaining ? Look there, do you not see a figure clambering over the fence ?\" \" Yes, I do, indeed. Ab, they have him, a prisoner, at all events. Those two dra goons havo him, fast enough ; we shall now, perhaps, hear from this fellow who is the actual ringleader in such an affair, which, but for the pusillanimity of the mob, might have turned out to be really most disastrous.\" It was strange how one man should think it expedient to attack the military post after the mob had been so completely routed at the first discharge of fire-arms, but so it was. One man did make an attempt to enter the gardeD, and it was so rapid and so desperate an one, that he rather seemed to throw himself bodily at the fence, which separated it from the meadows without, than to clamber over it, as any one under ordinary circumstances, who might wish to effect an entrance by that means, would have done. He was no sooner, however, perceived, than a couple of the dismounted soldiers stepped forward and made a prisoner of him. \" Release him,\" said the officer, as ho pointed to his head, and looked signifi cantly, as much as to say, \" Some mad patient of yours, I suppose ?\" \"You are much mistaken, eir,\" said Dr. Chillingworth ; \" this gentleman has been cruelly used, I have no doubt. He has, I am inclined to believe, been made the victim, for a time, of the intrigues of that very Sir Francis Varney, whose conduct has been the real cause of all the serious disturbances that have taken place in the country.\" \" Confound Sir Francis Varney,\" mut tered the officer ; \" he is enough to set a whole nation by the ears. However, Mr. Magistrate, if you are satisfied that this young man is not one of the rioters, I have, of course, no wish to hold him a prisoner.\" \" Good God !\" exclaimed Mr. Chilling worth, as they approached nearer with him. \" Good God ! what is the meaning of that ? Do my eyes deceive me, or are they, indeed, so blessed 1\" \"Blessed by what ?\" exclaimed the hang man. \" By a sight of the long lost, deeply regretted Charles Holland. Charles- Charles, is that indeed you, or some unsub stantial form in yoar likeness ?\" Charles Holland, for it was. indeed, him self, heard the friendly voice of the doctor and he called out to him \u2014 \" 1 can take Mr. Chillingworth's word for more than that,\" said the magistrate. Charles Holland was accordingly re leased, and then the doctor, in hurried accents, told him the principal outlines of what had occurred. \" Oh ! take me to Flora,\" he said ; \" let me not delay another moment in seek ing her, and convincing her that 1 could \" Speak to me of Flora.

She is in an extremely delicate state of health, and although I do not take upon myself to say that a shock of a pleasurable nature would prove of any paramount bad consequence to her, yet it is as well not to risk it.\" his own reflections.would do him a world of good, and wai, at all events, no very great modicum of punishment for the rascality with which he had behaved. By previous arrangement on the road between Charles Holland and Jack, it was agreed tbat the latter should precede the former a little when thuy neared the cot tage, so as to prepare Flora in some mea sure for the interview. How he acquitted himself of the task our narrative will show. Jack walked into the room, looked abont him in silence for a moment, tbrnst his bands in his breeches pockets, and gave a long whistle. \"What's the matter now?\" said the admiral. \" I will be most careful, you may de pend.\" At this moment there was a loud ring ing at the garden bell, and, when it was answered by one of the dragoons, who was ordered to do so by his officer, he came back, escorting no other than Jack Pringle, who had been sent by the admiral to the hall, bnt who bad solaced himself so much on the road with divers potations, that he did not reach it till now, whicb was full an hour after the reasonable time in which he ought to have gone the dis tance. \" D \u2014 me, if Charles Holland ain't out side, and I've come to prepare yon for the blessed shock,\" said Jack. \" Don't faint either of you, because I'm only going to let you know it by degrees, you know.\" A shriek burst from Flora's lips, and she sprung to the door of the apartment. \"What!\" cried the admiral, \"my ne phew \u2014 my nephew Charles ! Jack, you rascal, if you're joking, it's the last joke you shall make in this world ; and if it's true, I \u2014 I \u2014 I'm an old fool, that's all.\" \"Ay, ay, sir,\" said Jack; \"didn't you know that afore?\" Although Jack was very drunk, he managed to splutter something indicative of his pleasure at again seeing Charles, and volunteered to at once escort him to the cottage of the Bannerworths. \" Charles\u2014 Charles !\" cried Flora. He heard the voice. Her name escaped his lips, and rang with a pleasant echo through the house. \" Come along, nevey,\" said Jack Pringle, ns he strutted out in advance of Cbarles HoUand ; \" now you've found your way back, the first thing you ought to do is to report yourself as having come aboard. Follow me, and I'll soon show yer the port where the old hulk's laid his self up.\" Jack walked on fijst, tolerably steady, if one may take into account his divers deep potations, and Charles Holland, anti cipating with delight again looking upon the face of his much loved Flora, followed closely behind him. In another moment be was in tbe room, and had clasped her to his breast. \"My own \u2014 my beautiful \u2014 my true!\" \" Charles, dear Charles !\" \" Oh, Flora, what have I not endured since last we met ; but this repays me\u2014 more than repays me for all.\" \" What is tbe past now,\" cried Flora \u2014 \" what are all its miseries placed against this happy, happy moment?\" \" D\u2014 me, nobody thinks of me,\" said the admiral. \"My dear uncle,\" said Charles, looking over Flora's shoulder, as he stiU held ber in his arms, \"is that you?\" \" Yes, you swab, it is me, and yon know it ; but give us your five, you mutinous vagabond ; and I tell you what, I'll do you the greatest favour I've had an oppor tunity of doing you some time \u2014 I'll leave you alone, you dog. C*me along, Jack.\" \" Ay, ay, sir,\" said Jack ; and away they went out of the apartment. And now those two loving hearts were alone\u2014 they who had been so long sepa rated by malignant destiny, once again were heart to heart, looking into each We can well imagine the world of de lightful thoughts that came crowding upon him when Jack, after rather a long walk, announced that they were now very near the residence of the object of his soul's adoration. We trust that there is not one of our readers who, for one moment, will suppose tf at Charles Holland was the sort ol man to leave even such a villain and doable faced hypocrite as Marchdale, to starve amid the gloomy ruins where he was im mured. Far from Charles's intentions was any such thing ; but he did think that a night passed there, with no other company than"], [326, "VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE; OR, 316 other's face with all the beaming tender ness of an affection of the truest, holiest character. that we had loved each other with an affection not usually known, appreciated, or understood, and so, in the vanity of my best affections, I would strive to think them something exclusive, and beyond the common feelings of humanity.\" \" And you are right, my Flora ; such love as yours is the exception ; there may be preferences, there may be passions, and there may be sentiments ; but never \u2014 never, surely, was there a heart like yours.\" \" Nay, Charles, now yon speak from a too poetical fancy ; but is it possible that I have had you here so long, with your hand clasped in mine, and asked you not the causes of your absence ?\" \" Oh, Flora, I have suffered much- much physically, but more mentaUy. It was the thought of you that was at once the bane and the antidote of my existence.\" \" Indeed, Charles ! Did I present my- self in such contradictory colour i to you?\" \" Yes, dearest, as thus. When I thought of you, sometimes, in the deep seclusion of a dnngeon, tbat thought almost goaded me to madness, because it brought with it the conviction \u2014 a conviction peculiar to a lover \u2014 that none could so effectually stand between you and all evil as myself.\" \" Yes \u2014 yes, Charles ; most true.\" \" It seemed to me as if all the world in arms could not have protected you so well as this one heart, clad in the triple steel of its affections, could have shielded you from evil.\" The admiral had done a favour to them both to leave them alone, although we much donbt whether his presence, or the presence of the whole world, would have had the effect of controlling one generous sentiment of noble feeling. They would have forgotten everything but that they were together, and that once again each looked into the other's eyes with all the tenderness of a love purer and higher than ordinarily belongs to mortal affections. Language were weak to give utterance to the full gust of happy feelings that now were theirs. It was ecstacy enongh to feel, to know that the evil fortune whicb had so long separated them, depriving each existence of its sunniest aspect, was over. It was enough for Charles HoUand to feel tbat she loved him stUl. It was enough for Flora Bannerworth to know, as she looked into his beaming countenance, that that love was not misplaced, but was met by feelings such as she herself would have dictated to be the inhabitants of the heart of him whom she would have chosen from the mass of mankind as her own. \"Flora\u2014 dear Flora,\" said Charles, \" and you have never doubted me ?\" \" I've never doubted, Charles, Heaven or you. To doubt one would have been to doubt both.\" \" Generous and best of girls, what must you have thought of my enforced absence ! Oh, Flora ! I was unjust enough to your truth to make my greatest pang the thought that you might doubt me, and cast me from your heart for ever.\" \"Ah ! Charles, you ought to have known me better. I stood amid sore temptation to do so much. There wero those who would have urged me on to think that you had cast me from your heart for ever. There were those ready and willing to place the worst construc tion upon your conduct, and with a devU ish ingenuity to strive to make me par ticipate in such a feeling ; but no, Charles, no\u2014 I loved you, and I trusted you, and I could not so far belie my own judgment as to tell you other than what you always seemed to my young fancy.\" \"And you are right, my Flora, right ; and is it not a glorious triumph to see that love \u2014 that sentiment of passion\u2014 has en abled you to have so enduring, and so noble a confidence in aught human ?\" \"Ay, Charles, it is the sentiment of pas sion, for our love has been more a senti ment than a passion.

I can have no desire for revenge on such a man as Marchdale.\" \" You are right, Charles,\" said Flora ; \" let him go, and let him go with a feeling that he has acquired the contempt of those whose best opinions might have been his for a far less amount of trouble than he has taken to acquire their worst.\" I purporting to be written by him, which endeavoured to give so bad an aspect to the fact of his sudden disap pearance from Bannerworth Hall. Flora would insist upon the admiral, Henry, and the rest ofthe family, hearing all that Charles had to relate concerning Mr. Marchdale ; for well she knew that her mother, from early associations, was so far impressed in the favour of that hypocritical personage, that nothing but damning facts, much to his prejudice, would suffice to convince her of the character he really was. Excitement had kept up Charles to this point, but now, when he arose and ex pressed his intention of going to the ruins, for the purpose of releasing Marchdale, he exhibited such unequivocal symptoms of exhaustion and fatigue that neither his uncle nor Flora would permit him to go, so, in deference to them, he gave up the point, and commissioned the admiral and Jack, with Henry, to proceed to the place, and gave the viUaiu his freedom. The distance to the ruins was not so great from this cottage even as it was from Bannerworth Hall, provided those who went knew the most direct and best road to take ; so that the admiral was not gone above a couple of hours, and when he returned he sat down and looked at Charles with such a peculiar expression, that the latter could not for the life of him teU what to make of it But she was open to conviction, and when she really found what a villain she had cherished and given her confidence to, she shed abundance of tears, and blamed herself exceedingly as the cause of some of the misfortunes which had fallen upon her children. \" Very good,\" said the admiral ; \" I ain't surprised a bit. I knew he was a vagabond from the first time I clapped eyes upon him. There was a down look about the fellow's figure-head that I didn't like, and be hanged to him; but I never thought he would have gone the length he has done. And so you say you've got him safe in the ruins, Charles?\" \" I have, indeed, uncle.\" \"And then there let him remain, and a good place, too, for him.\" \" Something has happened, uncle,\" he said, \" I am certain ; tell me at once what it is.\" \" Oh! nothing, nothing,\" said the admi ral, \" of any importance.\" \"Is that what you call your feelings?\" said Jack Pringle. \" Can't you tell him as there came on a squall last night, and the ruins have come in with a dab upon old Marchdale, crushing his guts, so that we smelt him as soon as we got nigh at hand ?\" \"Good God !\" said Charles, \"has such a catastrophe occurred ?\" \"No uncle, no.

So nowbe off to bed at once.\" The doctor, without being at all accused of being a prejudiced maD, might well ob ject to the continued companionship of one, who, according to his own account was decidedly no better than he should be, if he were half so good. Moreover, it materially interfered with the proceedings of our medical friend, whose object was to watch the vampyre with all imaginable quietness and secrecy, in the event of his again visiting Banner. worth Hall. \"Sir,\" he said to the hangman, \"now that you have so obligingly related to me your melancholy history, I will not detain you.\" \" Oh, you are not detaining me.\" \" Yes, but I shall probably remain here for a considerable time.\" \" I have nothing to do ; and one place is about the same as another to me.\" The young man shook his uncle's hand in a cordial manner, and then repaired to the apartment provided for him. Charles Holland did, indeed, stand in need of repose; and for tbe first time now for many days he laid down with serenity at his heart, and slept for many hours. And was there not now a great and a happy change in Flora Bannerworth ? As if by magic, in a few short honrs, much of the bloom of her before-fading beauty returned to her.

In the first place, he was a much more powerful man than the doctor, and in the second, it was quite contrary to aU Mr. Chillingworth's habits to engage in any- thing like personal warfare. He could only, therefore, look bis vex- ation, and say \u2014 \" If you are determined npon remain- ing, I cannot help it; bnt when some one, as there assuredly wiU, comes from the Bannerworths here to me, I shall be under the necessity of stating candidly that you are intruding.\" \"Very good. As the morning air is keen, and as we now are not likely to be as good company to each other as we were, I shall go inside the house.\" This was a proposition which the doctor did not Uke, but he was compeUed to sub- mit to it ; and he saw, with feelings of uneasiness, the hangman make his way into the Hall by one of the windows. Then Dr. ChiUingworth sat down to think. Much he wondered what could be the secret ofthe great desire which Varney, Marchdale, and even this man had, all of them to be possessors of the old Hall. That there was some powerful incentive he felt convinced, and he longed for some conversation with the ' Bannerworths, or with Admiral Bell, in order that he might state what had now taken place. That some oue would soon come to hint, in order to bring fresh provisions sor the day, he was certain, and all he could do, iu the interim, was, to listen to what the hang ma > was about hi the HaU. \" No, no, not Varney ; but he is not the only one who has taken a great affection for Bannerworth HaU ; you may have another tenant sor it and I believe at aay price you like to name.\" \" Indeed !\" \" Hush ; creep along close to the honse, and then you will not be seen. There ! do you hear that noise in the hall?\" \" Why it sounds,\" said the admiral, \"Uke the ship's carpenter at work.\" \" It does, indeed, sound like a carpenter; it's only the new tenant making, I dare say, some repairs.\" \"D \u2014 n his impudence!\" \" Why, it certainly does look like a very cool proceeding, I must admit.\" \"Who, and what is he?\" \" Who he is now, I cannot tell you, but he was once the hangman of London, at a time when I was practising in the metro polis, and so I became acquainted with him. He knows Sir Francis Varney, and, if I mistake not has found out the cause of that mysterious personage's great attach ment to Bannerworth Hall, and has sound the reasons so cogent, that he has got up an affection for it himself.\" \" To me,\" said Henry, \" all this is as incomprehensible as anything can possibly be. What on earth does it all mean?\" \" My dear Henry,\" said the doctor, \" will you be ruled by me ?\" \" I wiU bo ruled by any one whom I know I can trnst ; sor I am like a mau groping his way in the dark.\" \" Then allow this gentleman who is car pentering away so pleasantly within the house, to do so to his heart's content, but don't let him leave it. Show yourselves now in the garden, he has sufficient pru dence to know that three constitute rather fearful odds against one, and so he will be careful, and remain where he is. If he should come out, we need not let him go until we thoroughly ascertain what he bas been about.\" Not a sound, for a considerable time, disturbed the intense stillness of the place ; but, now, suddenly, Mr. ChilUngworth thought he heard a hammering, us if some one were at work in one of the rooms of the HaU. \" What can be the meaning of that?\" he said, and he was about to proceed at once to the interior of the building, through the same window which had enabled the hang man to gain admittance, when he heard his own name pronounced by some one at the back of the garden fence, and upon casting his eyes in that direction, he, to his great relief, saw the admiral and Henry Bannnerworth. \" You shall command the squadron, doc tor,\" said the admiral, \" and have it aU your own way, you know, so here goes ! Come along, Henry, and let's show our selves ; we are both armed too !\" They walked out into the centre of the garden, and they were soon convinced that the hangman saw them, for a face appeared at the window, and was as quickly with drawn again. \"There,\" said the doctor, \"now be knows he is prisoner, and we may as well \"Come round to the gate,\" said the doctor. \"I am more glad to see you than I can teU you just now.

He would havo assas sinated poor Charles Holland in the crudest and most cold-blooded manner, and, how ever we may shudder at the manner of his deatb, we cannot regret it.\" \" Except that he has escaped your friend the hangman,\" said the admiral. \"Don't call him my friend, if you please,\" said Dr. Chillingworth ; \" but hark how he is working away, as if he really intended to carry the house away piece by piece, as opportunity may serve, if you will not let it to him altogether, just as it stands.\" \" Confound him ! he is evidently work ing on his own account,\" said the admiral, \"or he would not be half so industrious.\" Tbe hangman hesitated a moment, and looked at Admiral Bell ; apparently the result of the scrutiny was, that he would keep his word, for he suddenly turned and dived in at the window again without say ing another word. \" Well ; you have certainly stopped him from leaving,\" said Henry ; \" but what's to be done now?\" \" Let him be, let him be,\" said the doc tor; \"he mu3t come out again, for there are no provisions in the place, aud he will be starved out.\" \" Hush ! what is that?\" said Henry. There was a very gentle ring at the bell which hung over the garden gate. \" That's an experiment, now, I'll be bound,\" said the doctor, \"to ascertain if any one is here ; let us hide ourselves, and take no notice.\" The ring in a few moments was repeated, and the three confederates hid themselves effectually behind some thick laurel bushes, and awaited with expectation what might There was, indeed, a tremendous amount of hammering, and noise of one sort and another, from the house, and it was quite clear that the hangman was too heart and soul in his work, whatever may have been the object of it, to care who was Urteniog to him, or to what conjecture he gave rise. He thought, probably, tbat he could but be stopped in what he was about, and, until ho' was so, that he might as well go on. next ensue. Not long had they occupied their place of concealment, before they heard a heavy fall upon the gravelled pathway, immedi ately within the gate, as if some one had clambered to the top from the outside, and then jumped down. That this was the case the sound of foot steps soon convinced them, and to their surprise as well as satisfaction, they saw through the interstices of the laurel bush behind which they were concealed, no less a personage than Sir Francis Varney him self. \" It is Varney,\" said Henry. \"Yes, yes,\" whispered the doctor. \" Let him bo, do not move sor any consideration, for the first time let him do just what he likes.\" And on he went, with a vengeance, vex ing the admiral terribly, who proposed so repeatedly to go into tbe house and insist upon know what be was about, that his wishes were upon the point of being con ceded to by Henry, although they were combated by the doctor, when, from tho window at which he had entered, out stepped the hangman. \" Good morning, gentlemen ! good morning,'' he said, and he moved towards"], [332, "VARNEY, TUK V VMPYI'K ; Oil, 322 ..p n the fellow!\" said the mini ral ; \"And so should I,\" s.irl the admiral! \"although I protest again**! any liar in being done to him, on account of some sort of good felling that he has displayed, a'terall, in relei sing Charles from that dungeon in which llurchdale has perished.\" \" A ; the moment,\" said Henry, \" I had forgotrjn that; but I will own that his conduct has been tinctured by a strange and ,. ild kind of generosity at times, which would seem to bespeak, at tho bottom of his heart, some good feelings, the im pulses of which were only quenched by circumstances.\" \" That is my firm impression Of him, I can assure you,\" said Dr. Chillingworth. They watched Varney now from the leafy covert in which they were situated, and, indeed, had they been less effectually con cealed, it did not seem likely that the much dreaded vampyre would have perceived them ; for not only did he make no effort at concealment himself, but he took no pains to see if any one was watching him in his progress to the bouse. His footsteps were more rapid than they usually were, and there was altogether an air and manner about him, as if he were moved to some purpose which of itself was sufficiently important to submerge in its consequences all ordinary risks and all ordinary cautions. lie tried several windows of the house along that terrace of which we have more than once had occasion to speak, before he found one that opened ; but at length he did succeed, and stepped at once into the Hall, leaving those, who now for some moments in silence had regarded his movements, to lose themselves in a fearful sea of conjecture as to what could possibly be his object. \" At all events,\" said the admiral, \" I'm glad we are here. If the vampyre should have a fight with that other fellow, that we heard doing such a lot of carpentering work in the house, we ought, I think, to see fair play.\" \" I, for one,\" said the doctor, \" would not like to stand by and see the vampyre murdered ; but I am inclined to think he is a good match for any mortal opponent.\" \" You may depend he is,\" said Henry. \" But how long, doctor, do you purpose that we should wait here in such a state of suspense as to what is going on within the house ?\" \"there are some points about him that I like, after all, and he's quire an angel com pared to that rascal Marehda'e.\" \" He is\u2014 he saved Charles.\" \" He did, and not if I know it shall any harm come to him, unless he were terribly to provoke it by beoraing hini3elf the as sailant.\" \" How sad he looks !\" \"Hush! he comes nearer; it is not safe to talk.

As for the little party that was there assembled, and who looked upon him, they seemed thunde stricken by his presence; and Henry, probably, as well as the ad miral, would have burst out into some sudden exclamation, had they not been restrained by Dr. Chillingworth, who, sus pecting that they might in some way give an alarm, hastened to speak first, saying in a whisper \u2014 \" For Heaven's sake, be still ; fortune, you see, savours us most strangely. Leave Varney alone. You have no other mode whatever of discovering what he really wants at Bannerworth Hall.\" \" I am glad you have spoken,\" said Henry, as he drew a long breath. \" If you had not, I feel convinced that in another moment I should have rushed forward and confronted this man wbo has been the very bane of my life.\" \"I hope not long; bi< that something will occur to make us hk'/e food for action.

The reason why he became the inhabitant of a coffin was simply this : he had been hanged\u2014 executed at the Old Bailey, in London, before ever I set eyes upon that strange countenance of his. You know that I was practising surgery at the London schools some years ago, aud that, consequently, as I commenced the pro fession rather late in life, I was extremely anxious to do the most I could in a very short space of time.\" \" Yes\u2014 yes.\" \" Arrived, then, with plenty of resources, which I did not, as the young men who affected to be studying in the same classes as myself, spend in the pursuit of what they considered life in London, I was indefatigable in my professional la bours, and there was nothing connected with them which I did not try to ac complish. \" At that period, the difficulty of get ting a subject for anatomization was very great, and all sorts of schemes had to be put into requisition to accomplish so de sirable, and, indeed, absolutely necessary a purpose. \" Refers it to the vampyre ?\" \"It does \u2014 it does.\" \"Be brief, then ; I am in an agony of impatience.\" \" It is a circumstance concerning which I can be brief; for, horrible as it is, I have no wish to dress it in any adventitious colours. Sir Francis Varney, although under another name, is an old acquaint ance of mine.\" \" Acquaintance !\" said Henry. \"Why, you don't mean to say you are a vampyre ?\" said the admiral ; \"or that he has ever visited you ?\" \"No ; but I knew him. From the first moment that I looked upon him in this neighbourhood, I thought I knew him; but the circumstance which induced me to think so was of so terrific a character, that I made some efforts to chase it from my mind. It has, however, grown upon me day by day, and, lately, I have had proof sufficient to convince me of his identity with one whom I first saw under most singular circumstances of romance.\" \" Say on \u2014 you are agitated.\" \"I am, indeed. This revelation has se veral times, within the last few days, trembled on my lips, but now you shall have it ; because you ought to know all that it is possible for me to tell you of him who has caused you so serious an amount of disturbance.\" \"I became acquainted with the man who, I have told you, is in the i all at present, and who then filled the unenvia ble post of public executioner. It so hap pened, too, that I had read a learned trea tise, by a Frenchman, who had made a vast number of experiments, with galvanic and other apparatus, upon persons who had come to death in different ways, and, in one case, he asserted that he had actually recovered a man who had been hanged, and he had lived five weeks after wards. \" Young as I then was, in comparison to what I am now, in my profession, this inflamed my imagination, and nothing seemed to me so desirable as getting hold of some one who had only recently been put to death, for the purpose of trying what I could do in the way of attempting a resuscitation of the subject. It was pre cisely for this reason that I sought out the public executioner, and made his acquaint ance, whom every one else shunned, be cause I thought he might assist me by handing over to me the body of some con demned and executed man, upon whom I could try my skill. \" I broached the subject to him, and found him not averse. He said, that if 1 would come forward and claim, as next of kin, the body of the criminal who was to be executed the first time, from that period, that he could give me a hint that \"You awaken, doctor,\" said Henry, \" all my interest.\" \"And mine, too,\" remarked the admi ral. \" What can it all be about ? and where, doctor, did you first see this Var ney the vampyre ?\" \" In his coffin.\" Both the admiral and Henry gave starts of surprise as with one accord they ex claimed\u2014 \" Did you say coffin ?\" \" Yes . I tell you, on my word of hon our, thft the first time in my life I ever saw Sir Francis Varney, was in his coifin.\" \" Then ho is a vampyre, and there can be no mistake,\" said the admiral."], [334, "VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE; OR, 324 at all events, bestow upon it, in some se questered spot, a decent burial, with all the rites of the church. \" The sheriff was a man not over burthened with penetration.

I should have no real next of kin op ponents, he would throw every facility in my way, and allow the body to be re moved to his house. \"This was just what I wanted ; and, I believe, I waited with impatience for some poor wretch to be hurried to his last ac count by the hands of my friend, the public executioner. \" At length a circumstance occurred which favoured my designs most effec tually\u2014a man was apprehended for a high way robbery of a most aggravated charac ter. He was tried, and the evidence against him was so conclusive, that the defence which was attempted by his coun sel became a mere matter of form. \" He was convicted, and sentenced. The judge told him not to flatter himself with the least notion that mercy would be ex tended to him. The crime of which he had been found guilty was on the increase; it was highly necessary to make some great public example, to show evil doers that they could not, with impunity, thus trample upon the liberty of the subject, and had suddenly, just as it were in the very nick of time, committed the very crime, attended with all the aggravated circumstances which made it easy and desirable to hang him out of hand. \" He heard his sentence, they tell me, unmoved. I did not see him, but he was represented to me as a man of a strong, and well-knit frame, with rather a strange, but what some would have considered a handsome expression of countenance, in asmuch as that there was an expression of much haughty resolution depicted on it. \" I flew to my friend the executioner. \" 'Can you,' I said, ' get me that man's body, who is to be hanged for the highway robbery, on Monday ?' \"'Yes,' he said ; 'I see nothing to pre vent it. Not one sonl has offered to claim even common companionship with him, far less kindred. I think if you will pnt in your claim as a cousin, who will bear the expense of his decent burial, you will have every chance of getting possession of the body.' \" I did not hesitate, but on the morning before the execution, I caUed upon one of the sheriffs. \" ' Good !' I said ; ' and now as I am not a little anxious for the success of my ex periment, do you not think that you can manage so that the fall of the criminal shall not be so sudden as to break his neck?' \" ' I have thought of that,' he said, ' and I believe that I can manage to let him down gently, so that he shall die of suffo cation, instead of having his neck put out of joint. I will do my best.' \" ' If you can but succeed in that,' said I, for I was quite in a state of mania upon the subject, ' I shall be much indebted to you, and will double the amount of money which I have already promised.' \" This was, as I believed it would be, a powerful stimulus to him to do all in his power to meet my wishes, and he took, no doubt, active measures to accomplish all that I desiied. \" You can imagine with what intense impatience I waited the result. He resided in an old ruinous-looking house, a short distance on the Surrey-side of the river, and there I bad arranged all my apparatus sor making experiments upon the dead man, in an apartment the windows of which commanded a view of the entrance. \" I was completely ready by half-past eight, although a moment's consideration of course told me that at least another hour must elapse before there could be the least chance of my seeing him arrive for whom I so anxiously longed. \" I can safely say, so infatuated was I upon the subject, that no fond lover ever looked with more nervous anxiety sor the arrival of the chosen object of his heart, than I did for that dead body, upon which I proposed to exert all the influence of professional skill, to recal back the soul to its earthly dwelling-place. \"At length I heard the sound of wheels.

I was most anxious to effect an immediate resuscitation, if it were possi ble, of the hanged man. A little manipu lation soon convinced me that the neck was not broken, which left me at once everything to hope for. The hangman was more prudent than I was, and before I fully commenced my experiments, he said \u2014 \" To be sure, a sort of feeling had come over me at times, knowing as I did that the French are a nation that do not scruple at all to sacrifice truth on the altar of vanity, that it might be after all a mere rhodomontude ; but, however, I could only ascertain so much by actually trying, so the suspicion that such might, by a possi bility, be the end of the adventure, did not deter me. '\"Doctor, have you duly considered what you mean to do with this fellow, in case you should be successful in restoring him to life ?' '\"Not I,' said I. \" ' WeU,' he said, ' yon can do as you like ; but I consider that it is really worth thinking of.\" \" I was headstrong on the matter, and could think of nothing but the success or the non-success, in a physiological point of view, of my plan for restoring the dead to life; so I set about my experiments without any delay, and with a complete ness and a vigour that promised the most completely successful results, if success could at all be an ingredient in what sober judgment would doubtless have denominated a mad-headed and wild scheme. \" I officiously assisted in having the coffiu brought into the room where I had prepared everything that was necessary in the conduction of my grand experiment ; aud then, when no one was there with me but my friend the executioner, I, with his help, the one of us taking the head and the other the feet, took the body from the coffin and laid it upon a table. \" Hastily I placed my hand upon the region of the heart, and to my great de light I found it still warm.

What, too, if I have serious and important business here ?\" finished his most remark- able revela- tion concern- ing Sir Fran cis Varney, a revelation ed the fact of his being a vampyre or not; but rather, on the contrary, had a tendency to confirm any opinion lhat might arise from the circumstance of his being restored to life after his execution, favourable to that belief. \" Impossible.\" \" Well, I may as easily use such a term as regards what you call important business, but here I shall remain.\" \" Here you shall not remain.\" \"And will you make the somewhat hazardous attempt to force me to leave?\" \"Yes, much as I dislike lifiinp; my hand against you, I must do so ; I tell you that I must be alone in this house.

The admiral would, of course, have fought, and so might the doctor, as far as his hands would permit him ; but if the others had really been intent upon mis chief, they could, from their downright superior physical power, have taken the fives of the two that were opposed to them. No noise for some time came from the house ; but then the sounds, as if workmen were busy witMn it, were suddenly re sumed, and with more vigour than before. It was nearly two hours before Henry made the private signal which had been agreed upon as that which should pro claim his return; and then he and his bro ther, with Charles, who, when he heard of the matter, would, notwithstanding the persuasions of Flora to the contrary, come, got quietly over the fence at a part of the garden which was quite hidden from the house by abundant vegetation, and the whole three of them took up a position that tolerably well commanded a view of the house, whUe they were themselves extremely well hidden behind a dense mass of evergreens. \"Did you see that rascal, Jack Prin gle?\" said the admiral. \"Yes,\" said Henry ; \"he is drunk.' \" And we had no Uttle difficulty in shak ing him off. He suspected where we were going ; but I think, by being peremptory, we got fairly rid of him.\" \" The vagabond ! if he comes here, I'll brain him, 1 will, the swab. Why, lately he's done nothing but drink. That's the way with him. He'U go on sometimes sor a year and more, and not take more than enough to do him good, and then aU at once, sor about six or eight weeks, he does nothing but drink.\" \" I do know him. You told me that it was to him that I was mainly indebted sor my new existence ; and although I do not consider human life to be a great boon, I cannot bring myself to raise my hand against the man who, whatever might bave been the motives for the dead, at aU events, did snatch me from the grave.\" \"Upon my word,\" whispered the ad miral, \" there is something about that fel low that I Uke, after all.\" \" Hush !\" said Henry, \" listen to them. This would all have been unintelligible to us, if you had not related to us what you have.\" \" I have just told you in time,\" said Chillingworth, \" it seems.\" \"Will you, then,\" said the hangman, \" listen to proposals?\" \" Yes,\" said Varney. \" Come along, then, and I will show you wbat I have been about ; and I rather think you have already a shrewd guess as to my motive. This way \u2014 this way.\" They moved off to some other part of the mansion, and the sound of their voices gradually died away, so that, after aU, the friends bad not got the least idea of what that motive was, which still induced the vampyre and the hangman, rather than leave the other on tbe premises, to make an agreement to stay with each other. \" What's to be done now?\" said Henry. \"Wait,\" said Dr. ChUlingwortb, \"wait, and watch still. I see nothing else that can be done with any degree of safety.\" \" But what are we to wait for?\" said the admiral. \"By waiting, we shall, perhaps, find out,\" was the doctor's reply; \"but you may depend that we never shaU by inter fering.\" \" Well, well, be it so. It seems that we have no other resource. And when either or both of those fellows make their appear ance, and seem about to leave, what is to be done with them?\" \"They must be seized then, and in order that that may be done without any bloodshed, we ought to have plenty of force here. Henry, could you get your brother, aud Charles, if he be sufficiently recovered, to come?\" \"Certainly, and Jack Pringle.\""], [339, "THE FEAST OP BLOOD. 329 \" Well, well, we can do without him,\" said Henry. \"Without him! I should think so. Do you hear those fellows in the hall at work? D \u2014 n me, if I haven't all of a sudden thought what the reason of it all is.\" \" What\u2014 what ?\" said the doctor, anxi ously. \" Why, that rascal Varney, you know, had his honse burnt down.\" \"There comes your patient, doctor,\" said the admiral. ' Don't call him my patient,\" said the doctor, \" if you please.\" \" Why you know he is; and you are, in a manner of speaking, bound to look after him. Well, what is to be done?\" \"He must not, on any account,\" said Dr. Chillingworth, \" be allowed to leave the place. Believe me, I have the very strongest reasons for saying so.\" \"He shaU not leave it, then,\" said Henry. \"Yes; well?\" \" Yes, well. I dare say he didn't think it well. But, however, he no doubt wants another; so, you see, my idea is, that he's stealing the material from Bannerworth Hall.\" Even as he spoke, Henry Bannerworth darted forward, and Sir Francis Varney dropped from the window, out of which ho had clambered, close to his feet \" Hold !\" cried Henry, \" you are my prisoner!\" With the most imperturbable coolness in the world, Sir Francis Varney turned upon him, and replied \u2014 \" And pray, Henry Bannerworth, what have I done to provoke your wrath?\" \"What bave you done?\u2014 have you not, like a thief, broken into my house? Can you ask what you have done?\" \"Ay,\" said the vampyre, \"like a thief, perchance, and yet no thief. May I ask you what there is to steal in the bouse?\" By the time this short dialogue had been uttered, the rest of the party had come up, and Varney was, so far as regarded num bers, a prisoner. \" Well, gentlemen,\" he said, with that strange contortion of countenance, which now, they all understood, arose from the fact of his having been banged, and restored to life again. \" WeU, gentlemen, now that you have beleagured me in such a way, may I ask you what it is about r\" \"If you will step aside with me, Sir Francis Varney, for a moment,\" said Dr. Chillingworth, \"I will make to you a com munication which will enable you to know what it is all about.\" \" Oh, with pleasure,\" said the vampyre. \" I am not ill at present, but still, sir, I have no objection to hear what you have to say.\" He stepped a few paces on one side with the doctor, whilst the others waited, not without some amount of impatience, for the result of the communication. All that they could hear was, that Varney said sud denly \u2014 \" Oh, is that your notion?\" \" Yes, and a very natural one, I think, too, Master Doctor, whatever you may think of it. Come, now, have you a better?\" \" Oh, dear, no, certainly not; but I have a notion that something to eat would com fort the inner man much.\" They partook of some refreshments, and, as the day advanced, the brothers Bannerworth, as well as Charles Holland, began to get very anxious upon the sub ject of the proceeding of Sir Francis Varney in the Hall. They more than suspected Dr. Chilling worth, because he was so silent, and ha zarded no conjecture at all, of knowing something, or of having formed to himself some highly probable hypothesis upon the subject; but they could not get him to agree that such was the case. When they challenged him upon the subject, all he would say was \u2014 \" My good friends, you perceive that there is a great mystery somewhere, and I do hope that to-night it will be cleared up satisfactorily.\" With this they were compelled to be satisfied ; and now the soft and sombre shades of evening began to creep over the scene, enveloping all object--: in the dimness and repose of early night. No indication of the coming forth of Varney presented itself sor some time lon ger, and then, at least they thought, they heard a window open; and, turning their eyes in the direction whence the sound proceeded, they could see the form of a man slowly and cautiously emerging from it. As far as they could judge, from the distance at which they were, that form par took much of the appearance and tbe general aspect of Sir Francis Varney, and the more they looked and noticed its movements, the more they felt convinced that such was the fact. \" You are quite mistaken.\" And then tbe doctor appeared to be in sisting upon something, which the vampyre Ustened to patiently ; and, at the end, burst out with \u2014 , \" Why, doctor, you must be dreaming. At this, Dr. Chillingworth at once left him, and advancing to his friends, he said\u2014"], [340, "VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE ; OR, 330 \" Sir Francis Varney denies in toto all that I have related to you concerning him ; therefore, I can say no more than that I earnestly recommend you, before you let him go, to see that he takes nothing of value with him.\" \"Why what can you mean ?\" said Varney. \" Search him,\" said the doctor ; \" I will tell you why very shortly.\" \"Indeed\u2014 indeed!\" said Sir Francis Varney. \" Now, gentlemen, I will give you a chance of behaving justly anu quietly, so saving yourself the danger of acting other wise. I have made repeated offers to take this house, either as a tenant or as a pur chaser, all of which offers have been de clined, upon, I daresay, a common enough principle, namely, one which induces people to enhance the value of anything they have for disposal, if it be unique, by making it difficult to come at. Seeing that you had deserted the place, I could make no doubt but that it was to be had, so I came here to make a thorsugh examination of its in terior to see if it would suit me. I find that it will not; therefore, I have only to apologise for the intrusion, and to wish you a remarkably good evening.\" \"That won't do,\" said the doctor. \" What won't do, sir?\" \"This excuse will not do, Sir Francis Varney. You are, although you deny it, the man who was hanged in London some years ago for a highway robbery.\" Varney laughed, and held up his hands, exclaiming \u2014 \" Alas ! alas ! our good friend, the doc tor, has studied too hard; his wits, pro bably, at the best of times, none of the clearest, have become hopelessly entan gled.\" \" Do you deny,\" said Henry, \" then, that you are that man ?\" \" Most unequivocally.\" \"I assert it,\" said the doctor, \" and now, I will tell you all, for I perceive you hesitate about searching Sir Francis Var ney, I tell you all why it is that he has such an affection for Bannerworth Hall.\" pyre ; and, unhappily, in the rush which they, as soon as possible, made towards him, they knocked down the admiral, who im peded them much ; and before they conld spring over or past him, Sir Francis Var ney was gone. \" He has gone,\" said Henry. \" Let us go back and see into the state of poor Dr. ChiUingworth, who, I fear, is a dead man.\" They hurried back to tbe spot, and there they found the admiral looking as composed as possible, and solacing himself with a pinch of snuff, as he gazed upon the appa rently lifeless form at his feet. \" Is he dead?\" said Henry. \" I should say he was,\" replied the ad miral ; \" such a shot as that was don't want to be repeated. Well, I liked the doctor with all his faults. He only had one foolish way with him, and that was, that he shirked his grog.\" \"This is an awful catastrophe,\" said Henry, as he knelt down by the side of the body. \" Assist me, some of you. Where is Charles?\" \"I'll be hanged,\" said the admiral, \"if I know. He disappeared somewhere.\" \" This is a night of mystery as well as terror. Alas! poor Dr. Chillingworth! I little thought that you would have fallen a victim to the man whom you preserved from death. How strange it is that you should bave snatched from the tomb the very in dividual who was, eventually, to take your own life.\" The brothers gently raised the body of the doctor, and carried it on to the grass plot, which was close at hand. \" Farewell, kind and honest-hearted Chillingworth,\" said Henry ; \" I shall, many and many a time, feei your loss ; and now I will rest not until I have de livered up to justice your murderer. All consideration or feeling for what seemed to be latent virtues in that strange and in explicable man, Varney, shall vanish, and he shall reap the consequences of the crime he has now commuted.\" \" It was a cold-blooded, cowardly mur der,\" said his brother. \"It was; but you may depend the doctor was about to reveal something to us, which Varney so much dreaded, that he took his life as the only effectual way at the mo ment of stopping him.\" \" It must be so,\" said Henry. \"And, now,\" said the admiral, \" it's too late, and we shall not know it at aU. That's the way. A fellow saves up what ha has got to tell till it is too late to tell it, and down he goes to Davy Jones's locker with all his secrets aboard.\" \" Before you do,\" said Varney, \" there is a pill for you, which you may find more nauseous and harder of digestion than any your shop can furnish.\" As Varney uttered these words, he sud denly drew from his pocket a pistol, and levelling it at the unfortunate doctor, he fired it full at him. The act was so sudden, so utterly unex pected, and so stunning, that it was done before any one could move hand or soot to prevent it. Henry Banneworth and his brother were the furthest off from the vam-"], [341, "THE FEAST OF BLOOD. 331 this mystery among US ? If you have anything to say, why not say it at once.\" \" Because, I tell you. it's of nC use now. The game is up, Sir Francis Varney has escaped ; but still I don't know thut I need exactly hesitate.\" \"There can be no reason for your hesi tating about making a communication to us,\" said Henry. \" It is unfriendly not to do so.\" \"Not always,\" said Dr. Chillingworth, suddenly sitting bolt upright \u2014 \"not al ways.\" Henry and his brother started back in amazement, and the admiral was so taken by surprise, that had not the resuscitated doctor suddenly stretched cut his hand and laid hold of him by the ankle, he would h8\\e made a precipitate retreat. \"Hilloa! murder!\" he cried. \"Let me go ! How do I know but you may be a vampyre by now, as you were shot by one?\" \" My dear boy, you will excuse me for saying that you don't know what you are talking about.\" \" Can you give any reason ?\" \"Yes ; respect for the living. I should have to relate something of the dead which would be hurtful to their feelings.\" Henry was sUent for a few moments, and then he said \u2014 \" What dead ? And who are the living?\" Henry soonest recovered from the sur prise of the moment, and with the most unfeigned satisfaction, he cried \u2014 \" Thank God you are unhurt, Dr. Chil lingworth ! Why he must have missed you by a miracle.\" \" Not at all,\" said the doctor. \" Help me up \u2014 thank you \u2014 all right. I'm only a little stinged about the whiskers. He hit me safe enough.\" \" Then how have you escaped ?\" \" Why from the want of a bullet in the pistol, to be sure. 1 can understand it all well enough. He warned to create sufficient confusion to cover a desperate attempt to escape, and he thought that would bo best done by seeming to shoot me. The suddenness of the shock, and the full belief, at the moment, that he had sent a bullet into my brains, made me fall, and produced a temporary confusion of ideas, amounting to insensibility.\" \" From which you are happily re covered. Thank Heaven that, after all, he is not such a viUain as this act would have made him.\" \" Another time,\" whispered the doctor to him ; \" another time, Henry. Do not press me now. But you shall know aU another time.\" \"I must be content. But now let us remember that another man yet lingers in Bannerworth Hall. I will endure suspense on his account no longer. He is an in truder there ; so I go at once to dislodge him.\" No one made any opposition to this move, not even the doctor ; so Henry pre ceded them all to the house. They passed through the open window into the long hall, and from thence into every apart ment of the mansion, without finding the object of their search. But from one of the windows, up to which there grew great masses of ivy, there hung a rope, by which any one might easily have let himself down ; and no doubt, therefore, existed in all their minds that the hangman had sufficiently profited by the confusion in cidental to the supposed shooting of the doctor, to make good his escape from the place. \"And so, after all,\" said Henry, \"we are completely foiled ?\" \" We may be,\" said Dr. Chillingworth ; \" but it is, perhaps, going too far to say that we actually are. One thing, however, is quite clear ; and that is, no good can be done here.\" \" Then let us go home,\" said the ad miral. \" I did not think from the first that any good would be done here.\" They all left the garden together now ; so that, almost sor tbe first time Banner worth Hall was left to itself, unguarded and un watched by any ono whatever. It was with an evident and marked melan choly that the doctor proceeded with \"Ah!\" said the admiral, \"it takes people who have lived a little in these affairs to know the difference in sound be tween a fire-arm with a bullet in it, and one without. I knew it was all right.\" \"Then why did you not say so, ad miral?\" \"What was the use? I thought the doctor might be amused to know what you should say of him, so you see I didn't interfere ; and, as I am not a good hand at galloping after anybody, I didn't try that part of the business, but just remained where I was.\" \"Alas\u2014 alas!\" cried the doctor, \"I much fear that, by his going, I have lost all that I expected to be able to do for you, Henry. It's of not the least use now telling you or troubling you about it. You may now sell or let Bannerworth Hall to whomever you please, for I am afraid it is really woithless.\" \"What on earth do you mean?\" said Henry. \" Why, doctor, will you keep up"], [342, "VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE; OR, 332 the party to the cottage-house of the Bannerworths ; but, as after what he had said, Henry forbore to question him fur ther upon those subjects which he ad mitted he was keeping secret ; and as none of the party were much in a cue for general conversation, the whole of them walked on with more silence than usually characterised them. once sped onwards, clearing the garden fence, and taking to the meadows. It formed evidently no part of the in tentions of Charles HoUand to como up with him. He was resolved upon dogging his footsteps, to know where he should go; so that he might have a knowledge of his hiding-place, if he had one. \" I must and will,\" said Charles to him self, \"penetrate the mystery that hangs about this most strange and inexplicable being. I will have an interview with him, not in hostiUty, for I forgive him the evil he has done me, but with a kindly spirit ; and I will ask him to confide in me.\" CHAPTER LXXVIII. charles Holland's pursuit op the vampybe. \u2014 the dangerous interview. Charles, therefore, did not keep so close upon the heels of the vampyre as to excite any suspicions of his intentions to follow him ; but he waited by the garden paling long enough not only for Varney to get some distance off, but long enough like wise to know that the pistol which had been fired at the doctor had produced no real bad effects, except singeing some curious tufts of hair, upon the sides of his face, which the doctor was pleased to call whiskers. will be re collected that the admiral had made a remark about Charles Hol land having suddenly dis appeared; and it is for us now to ac count for that disappearance \" I thought as much,\" was Charles's ex clamation when he heard the doctor's voice. \" It would have been strikingly at variance with all Varney's other conduct, if he had committed such a deliberate and heartless murder.\" and to follow him to the pathway he had chosen. The fact was, that he, when Varney fired the shot at the doctor, or what was the supposed shot, was the farthest from the vampyre; and he, on that very ac count, had the clearest and best oppor tunity of marking which route he took when he had discharged the pistol. He was not confused by the smoke, as the others were ; nor was he stunned by the noise of the discharge ; but he dis tinctly saw Varney dart across one of the garden-beds, and make for the summer house, instead of the garden-gate, as Henry had supposed was the most pro bable path he had chosen. Now Charles Holland either had an in clination, for some reasons of his own, to follow the vampyre alone ; or, on the spur of the moment, he had not time to give an alarm to the others ; but certain it is that he did, unaided, rush after him. He saw him enter the summer-house, and pass out of it again at the back portion of it, as he had once before done, when surprised in his interview with Flora. Then, as the form of the vampye conld be but dimly seen, Charles ran on for some distance in the direction he had taken, and then paused again, so that if Varney heard the sound of footsteps, and paused to listen, they had ceased again probably, aud nothing was discernible. In this manner he foUowed the mys terius individual, if we may really call him such, for above a mile ; ani then Varney made a rapid detour, and took his way to wards the town. He went onwards with wonderful pre cision now in a right line, not stopping at any obstruction, in the way of fences, hedges, or ditches, so that it took Charles some exertion, to which, just then, he was scarcely equal, to keep up with him. At length the outskirts of the town were gained, and then Varney paused, and looked around him, scarcely allowing Charles, who was now closer to him than he had been, time to hide himself from ob servation, which, however, he did accom plish, by casting himself suddenly upon the ground, so that he could not be de tected against the sky, which then formed a back ground to thc spot where he was. Apparently satisfied that he had com pletely now eluded the pursuit, if any had But the vampyre did not now, as be had done on the former occasion, hide imme diately behind the summer-house. He seemed to be weU aware that that ex pedient would not answer twice ; so he at"], [343, "THE FEAST OF BLOOD. 333 been attempted, of those whom lie had left in such a state of confusion, the vampyre walked hastily towards a house that was to let, and which was only to be reached by going up an avenue of tress, and then unlocking a gate in a wall which bounded the premises next to the avenue. But the vampyre appeared to be possessed of every facility for effecting an entrance to the place and, producing from his pocket a key, be at once opened the gate, and dis appeared within the precincts of those premises. in the front of the house, that all applica tions to see it were to be made to a Mr. Nash, residing close at hand ; and, as Charles had the appearance of a respecta ble person, he thought he might possibly have the key entrusted to him, ostensibly to look at the house, preparatory possibly to taking it, and so he should, at all events, obtain admission. He, accor i ingly, went at once to this Mr. Nash, and asked about the house; of course he had to affect an interest in its rental and accommodation, which he did not feel, in order to lull any suspicion, and, finally, he said \u2014 He, no doubt, felt that he was hnnted by b of the town, and hence his fre quent change of residence since his own hud been burnt down, and, indeed, situated as he was, there can be no manner of doubt that he would have been sacrificed to the superstitious sory of the populace, if they could but have got hold of him. He had, from his knowledge, which was no doubt accurate and complete, of what he had done, a good idea of what his own fate would be, were he to fall into the bands of that ferocious multitude ; each individual composing which, felt a convic tion that there would be no peace, nor hope of prosperity or happiness, in the place, until he, the arch vampyre of all the supposed vampyres, was destroyed. Charles did pause for a few moments, after having thus become housed, to con sider whether he should then attempt to nave the interview he had resolved upon having by some means or another, or defer it, now that he knew where Varney was to be sound, until another time. But when he came to consider how ex- \" I should like to look over it if you will lend me the key, which I will shortly bring back to you.\" There was an evident hesitation about the agent when this proposal was com nu nicated by Charles Holland, and he said\u2014 \" I dare say, sir, you wonder that I don't say yes, at once ; but the fact is there came a gentleman here one day when I was out, and got a key, for we have two to open the house, from my wife, and he never came back again.\" That this was the means by which Var ney, the vampyre, had obtained the key, by the aid of which Charles had seen him effect so immediate an entrance to tbe house, there could be no doubt. \"How long ago were you served that trick?\" he said. \" About two days ago, sir.\" \" WeU, it only shows how, when one person acts wrongly, another is at once suspected of a capability to do so likewise. There is my name and my address ; I should like rather to go alone to see the house, because I always fancy I can judge better by myself of the accommodation, and I can stay as long as I like, and ascer tain the sizes of all the rooms without the disagreeable feeling upon my mind, which no amount of complaisance on your part could ever get me over, that I was most unaccountably detaining somebody from more important business of their own.\" \" Ob, I assure you, sir,\" said Mr. Nash, \" that I should not be at all impatient. But if you would rather go alone-*\u2014 \" \" Indeed I would.\" tremely likely it was that, even in the course of a few hours, Varney might shift his abode for some good and substantial reasons, he at once determined upon at tempting to see him. But how to accomplish such a purpose was not the easiest question in the world to answer. If he rung the bell that pre sented itself above the garden gate, was it at all likely that Varney, who had come there for concealment, would pay any attention to the summons? After some consideration, he did, how ever, think of a plan by whicb, at all events, he could ensure effecting an en trance into the premises, and then he would take his chance of finding the mysterious being whom he sought, and who probably might have no particular objection to meet ing with him, Charles Holland, because their last interview in the ruins could not be said to be otherwise than of a peaceable and calm enough character. He saw by the board which was nailed \" Oh, then, sir, there is the key. A gen tleman who leaves his name and address, of course we can have no objection to. I only told you of what happened, sir, in the mere way of conversation, and I hope you won't imagine for a moment that I meant to insinuate that you were going to keep the key.\" \" Oh, certainly not\u2014 certainly not,\" said Charles, who was only too glad to get the"], [344, "VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE. 334 key upou any terms. \"You are quite right, and I beg you will say no more about it ; I quite understand.\" He then walked off to the empty house again, and, proceeding to the avenue, he fitted the key to the lock, aud had the satisfaction of finding the gate instantly yield to him. When he passed through it, and closed the door after him, which de did carefully, he sound himself in a handsomely laid out garden, and saw the house a short distance in front of him, standing upon a well got up lawn. He cared not if Varney should see him before he reached the house, because the fact was sufficiently evident to himself that after all he could not actually enforce an interview with the vampyre. He only hoped that as he had found him out it would be conceded to him. The day had now fairly commenced, so that there was abundance of light, al though, even for the country, it was an early hour, and probably Mr. Nash had been not a little surprised to have a call from one whose appearance bespoke no necessity for rising with the lark at such an hour. AU these considerations, however, sank into insignificance into Charles's mind, compared with the object he had in view, namely, the unravelling the many mys teries that hung around that man. He as cended to the landing ofthe first story, and then, as he could have no choice, he opened the first door that his eyes fell upon, and entered a tolerably large apartment. It was quite destitute of furniture, and at the moment Charles was about to pronounce it empty ; but then bis eyes fell upon a large black-looking bundle of something, that seemed to be lying jammed up under the window on the floor \u2014 that being the place of all others iu the room which was enveloped in the most shadow. He started back involuntarily at the moment, for the appearance was one so shapeless, that there was no such thing as defining, from even that distance, what it really was. Then he slowly and cautiously ap proached it, as we always approach that of the chaiacter of which we are ignorant, and concerning the powers of which to do injury we can consequently have no defined idea. He, therefore, walked up the lawn with out making the least attempt at conceal ment, and when he reached the house he airlowed his footsteps to make what noise they would upon the stone steps which led up to it. But no one appeared ; nor was there, either by sight or by sound, any in dication of the presence of any living being in the place beside himself. Insensibly, as he contemplated the de serted place around him, the solemn sort of stillness began to have its effect upon his imagination, and, without being aware that he did so, he had, with softness and caution, glided onwards, as if he were bent on some errand requiring the utmost amount of caution and discrimination iu the con duction cf it. That it was a human form there, was the first tangible opinion he had about it; and from its profound stillness, and the manner in which it seemed to be laid close under the window, he thought that he was surely upon the point of finding out that some deed of blood had been committed, the unfortunate victim of which was now lying before him. And so he entered the hall of the house, where he stood some time, and listened with the greatest attention, without, however, being able to hear the least sound through out the whole of the house. \"And yet he must be here,\" thought Charles to himself; \" I was not gone many minutes, and it is extremely unlikely that in so short a space of time he has left, after taking so much trouble, by making such a detour around the meadows to get here, without being observed. I will examine every room in the place, but I will find him.\" Upon a nearer examination, he found that the whole body, including the greater part of the head and face, was wrapped in a large cloak ; and there, as he gazed, he soon found cause to correct his first opinion as to the sorra belonging to the dead, for he could distinctly hear the regular breath ing, as of some one in a sound and dream less sleep. Closer he went, and closer still. Then, as he clasped his hands, he said, in a voice scarcely above a whisper, \u2014 \" It is\u2014 it is the vampyre.\" Yes, there could be no doubt of the fact It was Sir Francis Varney who lay there, enveloped in the huge horseman's cloak, in which, on two or three occasions during the progress of this narrative, he has Charles immediately commenced going from room to room of that bouse in his search for the vampyre.

All he could say, was, \u2014 \" Varney, Varney ! do you not know me? I am Charles Holland. Will you now, in your mad rage, take the life you might more easily have taken when I lay in the dungeon from which you released me?\" What these incoherent words alluded to specially, Charles, of course, could not have the least idea, but he listened atten tively, with the hope that something might fall from his lips that would afford a key to some of the mysterious circumstances with which he was so intimately con nected. The sound of bis voice at once convinced Sir Francis Varney of his identity; and it was with a voice tbat had some tones of regret in it that he repUed, \u2014 Now, however, there was a longer silence than before, only broken occasionally by low moans ; but suddenly, as Charles was thinking of again speaking, he uttered some more disjointed sentences. \"No harm,\" be said, \"no harm, \u2014 Marchdale is a villain ! \u2014 Not a hair of his head injured\u2014 no \u2014 no.

I have, at much chance of imminence to myself, already once saved you, when another, with a sterner feeling, would have gladly taken your life; but now, as if you were determined to goad me to an act which I have shunned committing, you wiU not let me close my eyes in peace.\" \" Take your hand from off my throat, Varney, and I will then tell you what brought me here.\" Sir Francis Varney did so. \"Rise,\" he said \u2014 \"rise; I have seen blood enough to be sickened at the pros pect of more; but you should not have come here and tempted me.\" \" Nay, believe me, I came here for good and not for evil.

The effect was as startling as it was in stantaneous.

It is too bad to think, that because, through fighting the battles of his country, he has amassed some money, we are to eat it np.\" \" My dear friend.\" said Charles, \" does it not strike you that it would be a great deal worse than too bad, if my uncle could not do what he liked with his own?\" And, likewise, they were rather pleased than otherwise, since they knew not ex actly wbat had become of \"Charles HoUand, to think that they would probably be spared the necessity of saying they could not ac count for bis absence.

But yet they had that confidence in his courage and active intellectual resources, to believe that he would come through it unscathed, and, probably, shortly show himself at the cottage. In this hope they were not disap- pointed, for in about two hours Charles made his appearance; bur, until he began to be questioned concerning bis absence by the admiral, he scarcely considered the kind of dilemma he had put himself into by the promise of secrecy he bad given to Varney, and was a little puzzled to think how much he might tell, and how much he was bound in honour to conceal. \" Yes ; but, Charles, that is not the ques tion.\" \" I think it is, though I know not what other question you can make of it.\" \" We have all talked it over, my mother, my brother, and Flora ; and my brother and I have determined, if this state ot things should last much longer, to find out some means of honourable exertion by wbich we may, at all events, maintain our selves without being burdensome to any.\" \" Well-well, we wiU talk of that another time.\" \" Nay, but hear me ; we were thinking that if we went into some branch of tbe public service, your uncle would have the pleasure, such we are quite sure it would be to bim, of assisting us greatly by his name and influence.\" \"Avast there!\" cried the admiral; \"what's become of your tongue, Charles?

Among these things happened to be the box which Henry had mentioned, and from which he had taken a miscellaneous assortment of things of an antique and singular character. There were old dresses of a season and of a taste long gone by ; ancient articles of delence; some curiously wrought daggers; and a few ornaments, pretty, but valueless, along wiih others of more sterling preten sions, which Henry pointed out to Charles. \" I am almost inclined to think,\" said the latter, \" that some of these things are really of considerable value ; but i do not profess to be an accurate judge, and, per haps, I am more taken with the beamy of an article than the intrinsic worth. What is that which you have just taken from the box?'' \"It seems a half-mask,\" said Henry, \" made of silk ; and here are initial letters within it\u2014 M.

But time reconciles one to these dispensa tions, and to a friend, like yourself, I can talk upon these subjects without a pang.\" He laid down the mask, and proceeded further in his search in the old box. Towards the bottom of it there were some books, and, crushed in by the side of them, there was an ancient-looking pocket book, which Charles pointed out saying\u2014 \"There, Henry, who knows but you may find a fortune when you least expect it?\" \" Those who expect nothing,\" said Henry, \" will not be disappointed. At all events, as regards this pocket-book, you see it is empty.\" \" Not quite. A card bas fallen from it\" Charles took up the card, and read upon it the name of Count Barrare. \" That name,\" he said, \" seems familiar to me. Ah ! now I recollect, I have read of such a man.

A quick boy who had seen Varney enter and emerge from his own house before it was burnt down by the mob, had also seen him enter the empty house in which he had held his singular interview with Charles Holland, but a few hours before the appointed time for them to meet again. He quickly conveyed the intelligence to a gossiping grocer in the neighbourhood, who quickly set to work to alarm the fears of the already exci ed cottagers; aud in an \" Well, doctor,\" said Henry ; \" we are waiting for your opinion.\" \" My opinion !

As is usual on all such occasions, weapons of all kinds were brought into use, and a for- ward movement was made in the direction of the little lane that led to Varney's re- treat The village not being large, a few minutes sufficed to bring them to the gar- den gate of the house which contained the foe to tbe peace of their families. Some degree of caution was observed, for they took care to guard every outlet and to pretty well surround the house on three sides ; the fourth adjoined a row of tenanted premises, therefore they deemed he was as good as in their hands. A preconcerted loud rap was executed on the massive knocker of the old oaken door, which did no other good than to arouse Varney to a state of watchfulness. This summons being unheeded, a second and third was made, with the like success; finding this mode of proceeding insufficient, the more violent of the mob came forth, and by their united and continued exertions, ciused the door to yield to their pressure. Not many minutes elapsed ere the domes- tie offices, aud the entire lower portion of the house, had been thoroughly explored without meeting with the object of their hatred ; but on ascending the stairs they were sor a few minutes petrified to find Varney standing at the top with a huge weapon, in the shape of au oaken hand- rail, uplifted ready to deal destruction to the first who should have the temerity to ascend within its scope. This state of sudden terror and inaction, however, did not last long, for cne more daring than his fellows undauntedly ascended, and he was no sooner within the reach of the terrible weapon, than he received such a blow as no human head could withstand aud live. The dead man was carried out of the house by 6ome of his comrades, while others remained, as they said, to terribly avenge his death. Those who were in the hall and near the foot of the stairs, urged and pushed on those that were foremost, so that the leaders were obliged, by those behind, to attack Varney whether they were willing or not. He continued sor a time to maintain his position ; but from the weight of his weapon and the fre- quency of its use ho began to flag: besides, be had received some sharp blows upon his head and arms, which now began to tell on even his iron frame. He began to give ground, and the moment his assailants saw it they gained fresh courage, and pressed on much closer, and with more discretion than had characterised their onset. Varney's aim was now to gain a trap-door leading to the roof, wbich he had made some preparations tor reaching while the mob was outside the house ; hii position was now more critical than it had been at all. He felt, then, he must throw all his declining energies into one more attack, and gain the trap-door immediately afterwards, or content himself to yield to the tender mercies of a mob. He now wielded his weapon like a maniac, but with such deadly effect that his assailants fell back in astonishment. This was what he wanted, and now with all his remaining strength he mounted the ladder and gained the roof. He was not permitted to rest long, however, for the same means which enabled him to gain the roof gave his opponents the same facilities. About twenty men commenced the pursuit on the roof, but from the determinate character of Varney, and accidental causes, their numbers were diminished by oue half, and Varney managed to reach the ground by the tendrils of an old vine which grew up the gable-end of the last house forming the row. He made for the wood, closely pursued by persons who were fresh, and had not taken much activity in the former part of the conflict, but were thirsting for vengeance on the being who had deprived them of some dear relative. The wood was being so thoroughly examined, tbat Varney considered his last chance was gone, for he did expect to elude his pur suers in its intracacies. The moon yet shone on the fields ; he could hear the shouts of the mob, as various parties went through the wood from oue covert to another, and yet unable to find him. Then came a great shout upon his ears, as though they had found out he had left the wood. This caused him to redouble his speed, and, fearful lest he should be seen in the moonlight, he leaped over the first fence that he came to, with almost the last effort he could make, and then staggered in at an open door \u2014 through a passage into a front parlour, and there fell, faint, and utterly spent aud speechless, at the feet of Flora Bannerworth."], [358, "VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE; OR, 348 save me !\" he again said, raising himself on his bands. \"I am beset, hunted like a wild beast\u2014 they seek my life\u2014 they have pursued me from one spot tu another, and I have unwittingly intruded upon yon.

It will be most welcome to mp, I assure you.\" Sir Francis rose up, and, with the aid of Charles Holland, he walked to the next room, where he washed himself, and ar ranged his dress as well as it would admit of its being done. \" Mr. Holland,\" he said, \"I cannot tell you bow gratelul I feel for this.

Open the door and let us in \u2014 no one shall he hurt, or one single object in the house ; but we must come in, and search for the vampyre.\" \" Come to-morrow.\" \" That will not do,\" said the voice ; \"opsn, or we force our way in without more notice.\" At the same time a tremendous blow was bestowed upon the door, and then much force was used to thrust it in. A consultation was suddenly held among the inmates, as to what was to be done, but no one could advise, and each was well aware of the utter impossibility of keeping the mob out. \"I do not see what is to become of me,\" said Sir Francis Varney, suddenly appear ing before them. \" You must let them in; there is no chance of keeping them off, neither can you conceal me. You will have no place, save one, that will be sacred from their profanation.\" \"And which is that?\" \"Flora's own room.\" Ail started at the thought that Flora's chamber could in any way be profaned by any such presence as Sir Francis Varney's. However, the doors below were suddenly burst open, amid loud cries from the populace, who rushed in in great numbers, and began to search the lower rooms im mediately. \"All is lost!\" said Sir Francis Varney, as he dashed away, and rushed to the cham ber of Flora, who, alarmed at the sounds that were now filling the house, stood lis tening to them. \"Miss Bannerworth \" began Varney. \"Sir Francis!\" How Ipng he had sat there in melan choly musings he knew not; but suddenly he was aroused from his dreams by a voice that shook the skies, and caused him to stai t to his feet. \" Hurrah! \u2014 hurrah! \u2014 hurrah !\" shouted the mob, which had silently collected around the cottage ofthe Bannerworths. \"Curses I\" muttered Sir Francis, as he again sunk into his chair, and struck his head wiih his hand. \"I am hunted to death \u2014 they will not leave me until my body has graced a cross-road.\" \"Hurrah I \u2014 down with the vamnyre \u2014 pull him out!\" Then came an instant knocking at the doors, and the people on the outside made so great a din, that it seemed as though they contemplated knocking the house \" Yes, it is indeed I, Miss Bannerworth.

The sounds grew more and more distant ; the shouts and noise of men traversing the apartments subsided, and gradually the place became restored to its original silence. The mob, after having searched every other part of the house, and not finding tbe ob ject of their search, they concluded that he was not there, but must have made his escape before. <*-\u2022'\u2022'# \" It is not possible.

One minute more, and I am in the hands of a crew that bas no mercy.\" \" Hurrah ! upstairs. He's not below. Upstairs, neighbours ; we shall have him yet.\" These words sounded on the stairs ; half a-dozen more steps, aud Varney would be seen. It was a miracle he was not heard begging for his life. This most desperate peril of Sir Francis Varney seemed to have more effect upon him than anything that had occurred dur ing bis most strange and most eventful career. Varney cast a look of despair at the stairhead and felt sor his sword, but it was not there ; he had lost it. He struck his head with his clenched hand, and was about to rush upon his foes, when he heard the lock turn ; he looked, and saw the door opened gently, and Flora stood there ; he passed in, and sank cowering into a chair at the other end of the room, behind some curtains. When he was assured that the riotous mob that had been so intent upon his de struction was gone, and that he might emerge from his place of concealment, he did so with an appearance of such utter ex haustion that the Bannerworth family could not but look upon him as a being who was near his end. At any time his countenance, as we long bave had occasion to remark, was a strange and unearthly looking one ; but when we come to superadd to the strangeness of his ordinary appearance the tracesof deep men tal emotion, we may well say that Varney's appearance was positively of the most alarming character. When he was seated in the ordinary sitting apartment of the Bannerworths, he drew a long sighing breath, and placing his hand upon his heart, be said, in a faint tone of voice \u2014 The door was scarcely shut ere some tried to force it, and then a loud knocking came at the door, \" Open !\u2014 open ! We want Varney, the vampyre ! Open ! or we will burst it open.\" Flora did open it, but stood resolutely in tbe opening, and held up her hand to impose silence. \" Are you men, that you can come thus to force yourselves upon the privacy of a female? Is there nothing in the town or house, that you must intrude in numbers into a private apartment? Is no place sacred fiom you?\" \"But, ma'am\u2014 miss\u2014 we only want Varney, the vampvre.\" \" And can you find him nowhere but in a female's bedroom? Shame on you ! \u2014 shame on you ! Have you no sisters, wivts, or mothers, that you act thus?\" \" It beats now laboriously, but it will soon cease its pulsation for ever.\" These words sounded absolutely pro phetic, there was about them such a solemn aspect, and he looked at the same time that he uttered them so much like one whose mortal race was run, and who was now a candidate for the grave. \"Do not speak so despairingly,\" said"], [364, "VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE ; OR, 354 Charles Holland: \"remember, that if your life has been one of errors hitherto, how short a space of time may suffice to redeem some of them at least, and the communica tion to me which you have not yet com pleted may to some extent have such an effect.\" \"No.no.

She let her beautiful face be hidden by her hands, and she wept as she listened to the sad detail. Varney looked inquiringly in the coun tenance of Cnarles Holland, because, having given him leave to make Flora acquainted with the circumstance, he was rather surprised at the amount of emotion which it produced in her. Charles Holland answered the appeal ing look by saying, \u2014 \" Flora is already aware of the facts, bnt it naturally affects her much to hear them now repeated in the presence of others, and those too, towards whom she cannot feel \" Varney appeared to be hesitating sor a few moments, and then he said \u2014 \" Well, well.

It was Marma duke Bannerworth who first remembered \" AVe tore two stakes from a hedge, and with their assistance we contrived to dig a very superficial bole, such a hole as was only sufficient, by placing a thin coating of earth over it, to conceal the body of the murdered man. it, and he exclaimed, \u2014 \" ' By Heaven, we have buried the title deeds of the property, and we shall have again to exhume the corpse for the purpose of procuring them.' \"Now those deeds were nothing to me, and repugnant as I had felt from the first to having anything whatever to do with the dead bony, it was not likely that I would again drag it from the earth for such an object. \" ' Marmaduko Bannerworth,' I said, ' you can do what you please, and take the consequence of what you do, but I will not again, if 1 can help it, look upon the face of that corpse.

I heard what had been the last words used by Marmaduke Bannerworth on the occa sion of his death, and they were amply sufficient to lot me know what had been done with the money\u2014 at all events, so far as regards the bestowal of it in some secret place; and from that moment the idea of, by some means or another, getting the exclusive possession of it, never sotsook my mind. \" I thought over the matter by day and by night; and with the exception of having a knowledge of the actual hiding place of the money, I could see, in the clearest pos sible manner, how the whole affair had been transacted. There can be no doubt but that Marmaduke Bannerworth had reached home safely with the large sum of which he had become possessed, and that he had hidden it securely, which was bit an ordi nary measure of precaution, when wo come to consider how the property had been obtained. \" All my exertions were in vain. I could hit upon no scheme whatever; and at length, wearied and exhausted, I was com pelled to proceed to London for the sake of a subsistence. It is only in that great metropolis that such persons as myself, destitute of real resources, but infinitely reck less as regards the means by which they acquire a subsistence, can hope to do so. Once again, therefore, I plunged into the vortex of London life, aud proceeded, heedless of the criminality of what I was about, to cater sor myself by robbery, or, indeed, in any manner which presented u prospect of success. It wus during this career of mine, lhat I became associated with some of the most desperate characters of the time ; and the offences we commit ted were of that daring character that it could not bo wondered at eventually so formidable a gang of desperadoes must be by force broken up. \"It so occurred, but unknown to us, that the police resolved upon making one of the most vigorous efforts to put an end to the arf.iir, and in consequence a watch was set upon every one of our movements. \" The result of this was, as might have been expected, our complete dispersion, and the arrest of some of our members, ami among them myself. \"Then I suspect that, being alone, and left to the gloom of his own miserable thoughts, they reverted so painfully to the past that he was compelled to drink deep'y for the purpose of drowning reflection. \" The natural consequence of this, in his state, was, .hat partial insinity supervened, and at a moment when frenzy rose far abova reflection, he must have committed the dreadful act which hurried him instantane ously to eternity.\" _.__. . .. ......_, \u2022_..\u201e-__. ..._ -,.,... \"I knew my fate almost from the first.

All the sensations of a person suffering from a severe attack of night-mare came across me, and I was in such an agony, that I inwardly prayed for death to release me from such a cruel state of suffering. Then suddenly the power to utter a sound came to me, and I made use of it well, tor the piercing shriek I uttered must have struck terror into the hearts of all who heard it, since it appalled even myself. \" Then I suppose I must have fainted, but when I recovered consciousness again, I found myself upon a couch, and a man presenting some stimulus to me in a cup. I could not distinguish objects distinctly, bnt I heard him say, ' Drink, and you will be better.' \" I did drink, for a raging thirst con sumed me, and then I fell into a sound sleep, whicb, I was afterwards told, lasted nearly twenty-four hours, and when I re covered from that, I heard again the same voice that had before spoken to me, asking me how I was. \" In this state of affairs, and seeing no thing but death before me, I gave myself up to despair, and narrowly missed cheat ing the hangman of his -rtetitn. \" More dead than alive. I was, however, dragged out to be judicially murdered, and I shall never forget the crowd of frightful sensations that came across my mind upon that terrific occasion. \"It seemed as if my fate had then reached its climax, and I have really but a dim re collection of the terrific occasion. \" I remember something of the confused murmur arising from an immense throng of persons. I remember looking about me, and seeing nothing but what appeared to me an immense sea of human heads, and then suddenly I heard a loud roar of execration burst from the multitude. \" I shrunk back terrified, and it did, in deed, seem to me a brutal thing thus to roar and -shout at a man who was brought out to die. I soon, however, found that the mob who came to see such a spectacle we* not eo debased as I imaged, but that it wis ut the hangman, who had suddenly made his appearance on the scaffold, at whom they raised that fearful yell. \" Some one \u2014 I think it was one of the sheriffs \u2014 must have noticed that I was la bouring under the impression that the cry from the mob was levelled at me, for he spoke, saying \u2014 \" I turned in the direction of the sound, and, as my vision was now clearer, I could see that it was the hangman, whose face had made upon -the scaffold such an im pression npon me \u2014 an impression which I then considered my last in this world, but which turned ont not to be such by many a mingled one of pain aud pleasure since. \" It was some time before I could speak, and when I did, it was only in a few mut tered words, to ask what had happened, and where I was. \" < Do you not remember,' he said, ' that you were hanged?' \" ' I do \u2014 I do,' was my reply. ' Is this the region of damned souls?' \" ' No ; you are still in this world, how ever strange you may think it. Listen to me, and I will briefly tell you how it is that you have come back again, as it were, from the very grave, to Uve and walk about among the living.' \" I listened to him with a strange and rapt attention, and then he told how a young and enthusiastic medical man had been anxious to try some experiments with regard to the restoration of persons ap parently dead, and he proceeded to relate how it was that he had given ear to the solicitations of the man, and had consented to bring my body after it was hung sor him to experiment upon. He related how the doctor had been successful, but how he was so terrified at his own success, that he hastily fled, and had left London, no one knowing whither he had gone. \" ' It is at the hangman they shout,* and he indicated with his finger that public functionary. In my mind's eye I think I see him now, and I am certain that I shall never forget the expression of his face. It was perfectly fearful; and afterwards, when I learned who and what he was, I was not surprised that he should feel so acutely the painfully degrading office which he had to perform. \" The fatal rope was in a few minutes adjusted to my neck. I felt its pressure, and I heard the confused sounds of the monotonous voice of the clergyman, as he muttered some prayers, that I must con fess sounded to me at the time like a mockery of human suffering. \" Then suddenly there was a loud shout j \u2014 I felt the platform give way beneath my j feet \u2014 I tried to utter a yell of agony, but ; could not \u2014 it seemed to me as if I were encompassed by fire, and then sensation left me, and I knew no more. * * * * \"The next feelings of existence tbat came over me consisted in a frightful ting-"], [368, "358 VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE. \"I listened to this with thc most profound attention, and then he concluded, by saying to me \u2014 and I still looked forward to obtaining it by some means or another. \" It was in this juncture of affairs that one night I was riding on horseback through a desolate part of England. The moon was shining sweetly, as I came to a broad stream of water, across which, about a mile further on, I saw that there was a bridge, but being unwilling to waste time by riding up to it, and fancying, by the lazy ripple of the waters, that the river was not shallow, I plunged my horse boldly into the stream. \" When we reached its centre, some sudden indisposition must have seized the horse, for instead of swimming on well and gallantly as it had done before, it paused for a moment, and then plunged headlong into the torrent. \" I could not swim, and so, for a second time, death, with all its terrors, appeared to be taking possession of me. Tbe waters rolled over my head, gurgling and hissing in my ears, and then all was past. I knew no more, until I found myself lying upon a bright green meadow, and the full beams cf the moon shining upon me. \"I was giddy and sick, but I rose, and walked slowly away, each moment gather- ing fresh strength, and from that time to this, I never discovered how I came to be rescued from the water, and lying upon that green bank. It has ever been a mys- tery to me, and I expect it ever will. \" Then from that moment the idea lhat I had a sort of charmed life came across me, and I walked about with an im- pression that such was the case, until I came across a man who said that he was an Hungarian, and who was full of strange stories of vampyres. Among other things, he told me that a vampyre could not be drowned, for that the waters would cast him upon its banks, aud, if the moonbeams fell upon him, be would be restored to life. \" ' There can be no doubt but my duty requires of me to give you up again to the offended laws of your country. I will not, however, do that, if you will consent to an arrangement tbat I shall propose to you.' \" I asked him what tbe arrangement was, and be said that if I would solemnly bind myself to pay to him a certain sum per annum, he would keep my secret, and forsaking his calling as hangman, endea- vour to do something that should bring with it pleasanter results. I did so solemnly promise him, andi bave kept my word.

I need not go into the future details of this plan. Of course it was neither an honest nor respectable one, but it succeeded, and I soon found myself in a position to enable me thereby to keep my engagement, as well as to supply ije with the means of plotting and planning for my future for- tunes.

By inquiry, I ascertained that in that bed-room slept Flora Bannerworth. \" I had resolved, however, at first to try pacific measures, and accordingly, as you are well aware, I made various pro- posals to you to purchase or to rent Ban nerworth Hall, the whole of which you re jected ; so that I sound myself compelled to adopt the original means that had sug gested themselves to me, and endeavour to terrify you from the house. \" By prowling about, I made myself familiar with the grounds, and with all the plan of the residence, and then one nig h No. 46."], [370, "VARNEY, TIIE VAMPYRE; OR, 360 made my appearance in Flora's chamber by the window.\" \" But how do you account,\" said Charles Holland, \" for your extraordinary likeness to the portrait ?\" \"It is partly natural, for I belong to a collateral branch of the family ; and it was previously arranged.

And now it was a calm; Varney's stay at tbe cottage of the Barmerworths was productive of a different mood of mind than ever he had possessed before. He looked upon them in a very different manner to what be had been used to. He had, more- \" That you did.\" \" Flora fainted when I entered her cham- ber ; and the moment I looked upon her sweet countenance my heart smote me for what I wa9 about ; but I solemnly aver, that my lips never touched her, and that, beyond the fright, she suffered nothing from Varney, the vampyre.\" \" An 1 have you succeeded,\" said Henry, \" in your object now ?\" \" No ; the treasure has yet to be found.

But he, as well as myself, was soiled, and nothing came of the toilsome and anxious search but disappointment and bitterness.\" \" Then it is supposed that the money is still concealed?\" \" I hope so ; I hope, as well, that it will be discovered by you and yours ; for surely none can have a better right to it thau you, who have suffered so much on its ac count.\" \"And yet,\" remarked Henry, \"I can not help thinking it is too securely hidden from us. The picture has been repeatedly removed from its place, aud produced no results ; so that 1 fear we have little to ex pect from any further or more protracted research.\" \" I think,\" said Varney, \" that you have everything to expect.

He was an altered man. He saw in the Bannerworths those who had saved his life, and who, without doubr, had possessed an opinion, not merely obnoxious to him, but must have had some fearful misgivings concerning his charac ter, and that, too, ofa nature that usually shuts out all hope of being received into ar y family. But, io the hour of his need, when his life was in danger, no one else would have done what they bad done for him, especially when so relatively placed. Moreo er. he harl been concealed, when to do so was both dangerous and difficult ; and then it was done by Flora Banner worth herself. for his physical powers were fast decaying; he was not, in fact, the same man. He came o-it into the parlour from the room in which he had been seated during the day. Flora and her mother were there, while Charles Holland and Henry Bannerworth had both at that moment entered the apartment. \" Good evening, Mis9 Bannerworth,\" said Sir Francis, bowing to her, and then to her mother, Mrs. Bannerworth; \"and you, Mr. Holland, I see, have been out en joying the free breeze that plays over the hot fields.

The mode of passing time at the cottage was calm and serene. Var ney had seldom witnessed anything like it; bur, at the -.amo time, he felt more at ease than ever he had; he was charmed with thesocietyof Flora\u2014 in lary, with the whole ofthe little knot of individuals who were collected together; from what he saw he was gratified io th irsocie'y, and it seemed to alleviate his men'al di-quiet, and the sense he must feel of his owu peculiar posi tion. But Varney became ill. The state of mind ami body he had been in sor some time past might be the cause of it. He had been much hara-sed, and bunted from place to plac.-. There was not a moment in which his life wai not in danger, and he had, moreover, in ruo.e than one case, re ceived some bodiy injuries, bruises, and contusions of a desperate character; and yet he would take no notice of them, but allow them to get weU again, as be6t they could.

He walked from room to room in the twilight, at which time he had more liberty permitted him that at any other, because there was not ihe same danger in his doing so; for, if once seen, there could be no manner of doubt but he would have been pursued until he was destroyed, when no other means of escape were at hand; and Varney himself felt that, there could be no chance of his again escaping fiom them, \" Have you heard any news abroad to day?

There has been much evapo- ration going on, and now it shows itself in giving the moon that peculiar large ap- pearance and deep colour.\" \" Ay, I see ; it peeps through the trees, the branches of which cut it up into various portions.

The chase of Varney was a fruitless one, and the three men returned in about an hour without bim. As he spoke he stepped by the old wo man, and laying his band upon the handle of the door, entered the apartment, at the same time looking carefully around the room as if he expected some one. \"Ladies,\" said the stranger, with an off-hand politeness that had something repulsive in it, though it was meant to convey a notion that civility was intended ; \"ladies, I beg pardon for intruding, but I am looking sor a gentleman.\" \" You shall hear from me again soon,\" said Sir Francis, in an almost impercepti ble whisper. \" What is the object of this intrusion?\" demanded Henry Bannerworth, rising and confronting the stranger. \" This is a strange introduction.\" \" Yes, but not an unusual one,\" said the stranger, \" in these cases \u2014 being unavoid able, at the least.\" \" Sir,\" said Charles Holland, \" if you cannot explain quickly youi business here, we will proceed to take those measures whicb will at least rid ourselves of your company.\" \"Well, here's the road,\" said one. \"I must go np to the house where I started him from.

He, there fore, left general orders with his wife, when ever he went on a journey to Varney, if he should be gone beyond a certain time, she was to open a certain drawer, ami Sake out a sealed packet to the magi-tralc at the chief office, who would atten 1 to it. \"He has been missing, and his wife did as she was desired, and now we have found what he there mentioned to be true ; but, now, sir, I have satisfied you and ex plained to you why we intruded npon you, we must now leave and seek sor him else where.\" \" I will tell yon, sir. You see that this Varney was a regular scamp, gamester, rogue, and murderer. He was hanged and hung about the usual time ; he was cut down and the body given to some one for dissection, when the surgeon, with the hangman, one Montgomery, succeeded in restoring the criminal to Ijfo.\" \"But I always thought they broke the neck when they were hanged ; the weight of the body would alone do that.\" \"Ob, dear, no, sir,\" said the officer; \" that is one of the common every-day mistakes ; they don't break the neck once in iwenty times.\" \" Indeed !\" \" It is most extraordinary, and that is the reason why his complexion is bo sin gular.\" \" Very likely.\" They poured nut some wine, which was handed to the officers, who drank and then quitted the house, leaving the inmates in a state of stupefaction, from surprise and amazement at what they bad heard from the officers. \"No; they die of suffocation only ; this man, Beauchamp, was hanged thus, but they contrived to restore him, and then he assumed a new name, and left London.\" \" But how came you to know all this?\" \" Oh ! it came to us, as many things usually do, in a very extraordinary manner, and in a manner that appears most singu lar and out-of-the-way ; butsnch it was. \" The executioner who was the means of his being restored, or one of them, wished to turn him to account, and used to draw a yearly sum of money from him, as hush money, to induce them to keep the secret ; else the fact of his having escaped punish ment would subject him to a repetition of the same punishment; when, of course, a little more care would be taken that he did not escape a second time.\" There was a strange feeling came over them when they recollected the many oc curencesthey had witnessed, and even tho explanation of the officers ; it seemed as if some mist had enveloped objects and rendered them indisrinet, but which was fast rising, and they were becoming plainer and more distinct every moment in which they were regarded. There was a long pause, and Flora was about to speak, when suddenly there came the sound of a footstep across the garden. It was slow but unsteady, and paused be tween whiles until it came close beneath the windows. They remained silent, and then some one was heard to climb up the rails ofthe veranda, and then the curtains were thrust aside, but uot till after the per son outside had paused to ascertain who was there. \" I dare say not.\" \" Well, you see, Varney, or rather Beau champ, was to pay a heavy sum to this man to keep him quiet, and to permit him to enjoy the life he had so strangely become possessed of.\" \" I see,\" said Holland. \" Well, this man, Montgomery, had always some kind of suspicion that Varney would murder him.\" Then the curtains were opened, and the visage of Sir Francis Varney appeared, much altered ; in fact, completely worn and exhausted. \"Murder him! and he the means of saving his life ; surely he could not be so bad as that.\" 'Why, you see, sir, this hangman drew a heavy 6um yearly from him ; thus mak ing him only a mine of wealth to himself; this, no doubt, would Tinkle in the other's heart, to think he should be so beset, and hold life upon 6uch terms.\" \" I see, now.\" \" Yes ; and then came the consideration that he did not do it from any good motive, merely a selfish one, and he was conse qin miy under no obligation to him for what he bad done ; besides, 6eli-preservati_n It was useless to deny it, but he looked ghastly \u2014 terrific ; hissingular visage was as pallid as deaih ; hit eyes almost protruding, his mouth opened, and his breathing short, and laboured in the extreme. He climbed over with much difficulty, and staggered into the room, and would have spoken, but he could not ; he fell senseless upon the floor, utterly exhausted and motionless. There was a long pause, and each one"], [375, "THE FEAST OF BLOOD. 365 present looked at each other, and then they gazed upon the inanimate body of Sir Francis Varney, which lay supine and senseless in the middle of the floor. and began to loosen the earth by means of the sharp end. \"That will do for the present,\" said Chillingworth ; \"now let me and Charles take a turn with our shovels, and you will get on again presently. Throw the earth up on the bank in one heap, so that we can put it on again without attracting any attention to the spot by its being left in clods and uneven.\" **-\u25a0\u2022\u25a0* The importance of the document, said to be on the dead body, was such that it would admit of no delay before it was obtained, and thc party determined that it should oe commenced instanter. Lost time would be an object to them ; too much haste could hardly be made ; and now came the question of, \" should it be to-night, or not ?\" \"Exactly,\" said Henry, \"else the body will be discovered.\" They began to shovel away, and con tinued to do so, after it had been picked up, working alternately, until at length Charles stuck his pickaxe into something soft, and upon pulling it up, he found it was the body. A dreadful odour now arose from the 3pot, and they were at no loss to tell where the body lay. The pickaxe had stuck into the deceased's ribs and clothing, and thus lifted it out of its place. \" Here it is,\" said the doctor ; \" but I needn't tell you that ; the charnel-house smell is enough to convince you of the fact of where it is.\" \" Certainly,\" said Henry Bannerworth ; \" the sooner we can get it, the sooner ali doubt and distress will be at an end ; and, considering the run of events, that will be desirable sor all our sakes ; besides, we know not what unlucky accident may happen to deprive us of what is so neces sary.\" \" There can be none,\" said Mr. ChiUing worth ; \" but there is this to be said, this has been such an eventful history, that I cannot say what might or what might not happen.\" \" We may as well go this very night,\" said Charles Holland. \"I give my vote for an immediate exhumation of the body. The night is somewhat stormy, but nothing more ; the moon is up, and there will be pi nty of light.\" Alter having duly inspected the state of the efficiency of the tools they had selected they started away on their expedition.; The night had turned gloomy and windy; heavy driving masses of clouds obscured the moon, which only now and then was to be seen, when tbe clouds permitted her to peep out. At tho same time, there were many drifting showers, which lasted but a few minutes, and then the clouds were carried forwards by some sudden gust of wind, so that, altogether, it was a most uncomfortable night as well could be ima gined. However, there was no time to lose, and, under all circumstances, they could not have chosen a better night tor their pur pose than the one they had ; indeed, they could not desire another night to be out on sucb a purpose. \" I think so ; just show a light upon the subject, doctor, and then we can see what we are about \u2014 do you mind, doctor \u2014 you have the management of the lantern, you know?\" \" Yes \u2014 yes,\" said Chillingworth; \"I see you have it \u2014 don't be in a hurry, but do things deliberately and coolly whatever you do\u2014 you will not be so liable to make mistakes, or to leave anything undone.\" \" There will be nothing of any use to you here, doctor, in the way of dissection, for the flesh is one mass of decay. What a horrible sight, to be sure !\" \" It is ; but hasten the search.\" \" Well, I must ; though, to confess the truth, I'd sooner handle anything than this.\" \" It is not the most pleasant thing in the world, for there is no knowing what may be the result \u2014 what creeping thing has made a home of it.\" \" Don't mention anything about it.\" Henry and Charles Holland now began to search the pockets of the clothes of the dead body, in one of which was something hard, that felt like a parcel. \" What have you got there?\" said Chil lingworth, as he held the lantern up so that the light fell upon tbe ghastly object that they were handling. \" I think it is the prize,\" said Charles Holland ; \" but we have not got it out yet, though I dare say it won't be long first, if this wind will but hold good for about five minutes, and keep the stench down.\" In a short time they reached their des tination. \" Here,\" said the doctor, pointing out thc marks by which the spot might be re c >gnised ; \" here is the spot, and I thiuk we shall not be half a soot out of our reckoning.\" \" Then let us begin instanter,\" said Henry, as he seized hold of the pickaxe,"], [376, "VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE. 368 They now tore open the pocket and pulled out the papers, which uppearcd to have been secreted npon his person. \"Bo sure there are none on any other part of the body,\" said ChiUingworth ; \"because what you do now, you had better do well, and leave nothing to after thought, because it is frequently im practicable.\" \" The advice is good,\" said Henry, who made a second search, but found nothing. \" We had better re-bury him,\" said the doctor; \"it had better be done cleanly. Well, it is a sad hole for a last resting place, and yet I do not know that it matters \u2014 it is all a matter of taste\u2014 the fashion of the class, or the particular custom of the country.\" There was but little to be said against such an argument, though the custom of the age had caused them to look upon it more as a matter of feeling thau in such a philosophical sense as that in which the doctor had put it. \" Well, there he is now \u2014 shovel the earth in, Charles,\" said Henry Bannerworth, as he himself set the example, which was speedily and vigorously followed by Charles Holland, when they were not long before ihe eartii was thrown in. and covered up with care, and trodden down so that it should not appear to be moved. \"That will do, I think,\" said Henry, \" Yes ; it is not quito the same ; but I dare say no one will try to make any dis coveries in this place ; besides, if the rain continues to come down very heavy, why, it will wash much of it away, and it will make it look all alike.\" CHATTER LXXXI.

Doctor Chillingworth, but ill satisfied with the events that had yet taken place, determined once more upon visiting the Hall, and there to attempt a discovery of something respecting the mysterious apart ment in which so much has already taken place. He communicated his design to no one; he resolved to prosecute tho inquiry alone. He determined to go there and await what ever might turn up in the shape of events. He would not for once take any com panion ; such adventures were often best prosecuted alone\u2014 they were moit easily brought to something like an explanatory position ; one person can often consider matters more coolly than more. At all events, there is more secrecy than under any other cir cumstances. There was little inducement to hover about the spot ; but Henry could not for bear holding up tbe papers to the light of the lantern to ascertain what they were. \" Are they all right ?\" inquired the doctor. Perhaps this often is of greater conse quence than many others ; aud, moreover, when there is more than one, something is us - 'ly overdone. Where one adventurous individual will rather draw back iu a pur suit, more than one would induce them to urge each other on. In fact, one in such a case could act the part of a spy \u2014 a secret observer ; and in tbat case can catch people at times when they could not under any other circum stances be caught or observed at all. \"I will go,\" he muttered ; \"aud should I be compelled to run away again, why, nobody knows anything about it, aud no body will laugh at me.\" This was all very well ; but Mr. Chil lingworth was not the man to run away without sufficient cause. But there was so much mystery in all this that he felt much interested in the affair. But this issue he could not command ; at the same time he was determined to sit and watch, and thus \" Yes,\" replied Henry, \"yes. Tho Deer brook estate. Oh, yes! they are the papers I am in want of.\" \" It is singularly fortunate, at least, to be so successful iu securing them. I am very glad a living person has possession of them, else it would have been very difficult to have obtained it from them.\" \" So it would ; but now homeward is the word, doctor ; and on my word there is reason to be glad, sor tbe rain is coming on very fast now, and there is no moon at all\u2014 we had better step out.\" They did, sor the three walked as fast as the nature of the soil would permit i hem, and tbe darkness of tbe night."], [377, "VARNEVTHB VAMPYRE; OR THE FEAST OF BLOOD. 367 %%&%%\u00a3\u00a3$? \u00b0\u00b0\u2122^ Even the knowledge of that mueh-that some inexplicableacfionVtltmgotgt' -was far preferable to the uncertainty of not knowing whether what had once been going on was still so or not, because, fi ~^^^ that noth^ ITZ\u2122* fwer be k,aown concerning it, ft, Sir^ 8t'U be * \"W \" It shall be fotbn-m.^ -e tu .. possibilitycfl! it?? 7 \u00a3e aDy mS^lI^Tu 3 have\" THE STRUOGI.E EETWEES VARNEY AND THE DOCTOR FOR THE PICTURE. thought that so quiet and orderly a spot as this, our quiet village, would have suf fered so much commotion and disturbance? Far from every cause of noise and strife, it is quite as great a matter of mystery as the vampyre business itself. \" I have been so mixed up in this busi ness that I must go through with it By the way, of the mysteries, the greatest that I have met with is tbe fact of the vampyre having anything to do with so quiet a family as the Bannerworths.\" Mr. Chillingworth pondered over the thought ; but yet he could make nothing of it.

This was precisely what was most desi rable in the present state of affairs ; while things remained in the present state of un certainty, there would be much more of mystery than could ever be brought to Ught. One or two circumstances cleared up, the minor ones would follow in the same train, and they wonld be explained by the others; and if ever that happy state ot things were to come about, why, then there would be a perfect calm in the town. Mr. Chillingworth got to the HaU, and unobserved, for he had been especially careful not to be seen ; he had watched on all side9, and no signs of a solitary human being had the seen that could in any way make the slightest observation upon bim. Indeed, he had sheltered himself from observation at every point of the road, es pecially so when near Bannerworth Hall, where there were plenty of corners to en able him to do so; and when he arrived there, he entered at the usual spot, and then sat down a few moments in the bower. The doctor was for a moment completely red, it was so utterly unexpected, and be stepped back a pace or two in the first emotion of his surprise ; but this soon bassed by, and he prepared to close with his antagonist, which he did without speak ing a word. There was a fair struggle for more than two or three minutes, during which the doctor struggled and foughtmost manfully; but it was evident that Mr. Chillingworth had met with a man who was his superior in point of strength, for he not only with stood the ntmost force that Chillingworth could bring against him, but maintained himself, and turned his strength against the doctor. Chillingworth panted with exertion, and found himself gradually losing ground, and was upon the point of being thrown down at the mercy of his adversary, who appeared to be inclined to take all ad vantages of him, when an occurrence hap pened tbat altered the state of affairs alto gether. WhUe they were struggling, the doctor borne partially to the earth \u2014 bnt yet struggling, suddenly his antagonist re leased his hold, and staggered back a few paces. \" There, you swab \u2014 take that; I am yard-arm and yard-arm with you, you piratical-looking craft \u2014 you lubberly buca neering son ofa fish-fag.' ' Before, however, Jack Pringle, for it was he who came ao opportunely to the rescue of Dr. Chillingworth, could find time to finish the sentence, he found himself as sailed by the very man who, but a minute before, he had, as he thought, placed hon de combat. \" I wiU not sit here,\" he muttered. \" I will go and have a watch at that mysterious picture; there is the centre of attraction, bo it what it may.\" As he spoke, he arose and walked into tbe house, and entered the same apartment which has been so often mentioned to the reader. Here he took a chair, and sat down full before the picture, and began to contem plate it \" Well for a good likeness, I cannot say I ever saw anything mjre unprepossessing. I am sure such a countenance as that could never have won a female heart. Surely, it is more calculated to terrify the imagi nation, than to soothe the affections of the timid and shrinking female. \" However, I will have an inspection of the picture, and see if I can make anything of it.\" As he spoke, he put his hand upon the picture with the intention of removing it, when it was suddenly thrust open, and a man stepped down. A desperate fight ensued, and the stranger made she greatest efforts to escape with the picture, but found he could not get off without a desperate struggle. He was, at length, compelled to relinquish the hope of carrying that off, for both Mr. ChiUing worth and Jack Pringle were engaged hand to hand ; but the stranger struck Jack so heavy a blow on the head, that made him reel a few yards, and then he escaped through the window, leaving Jack and Mr. Chillingworth masters of the field, but by no means unscathed by tbe conflict in which they had been en gaged."], [379, "THE FEAST OF 15LOOD. 369 CHAPTER LXXXII THE GBAND CONSULTATION BROKEN UP BT MP.8.

But now that he knew this small estate, the title deeds of which had beeu so singu larly obtained, had once really belongel to the family, but had been risked aud lost at the gaming-table, he had no earthly scruple in calling such property again his own.

From a state of great de- spond ency, and, indeed, absolute po s verty, theyhad suddenly risen As to the large sum of money which Sir Francis Varney in his confessions had declared to have found its way into the possession of Marmaduke Bannerworth, Henry did not expect, and scarcely wished to become possessed of wealth through so tainted a source. \"No,\" he said to himself frequently; \"no \u2014 I care not if that wealth be never forthcoming, which was so badly got pos session of. Let it sink into the earth, if, indeed, it be buried there ; or let it rot in some unknown corner of the old mansion. I care not sor it.\" to comfort and independence. It seemed as if the clouds that had ob- scured their destiny had now, with one accord, dissipated, and that a brighter day was dawning. Not only had the circum- stances of mental terror which had sur- rounded them given way in a great mea- sure to the light of truth and reflection, but those pecuniary distresses which had pressed upon them for a time were like- wise pas-fog away, and it seemed probable that they would be in a prosperous condi- tion. The acquisition of the title deeds of the estate, which they thought had passed away from the family for ever, became to them, in their present circumstances, an immense acquisition, and brought to their minds a feeling of great contentment. Many persons in their situation would have beeu extremely satisfied at having secured so strong an interest in the mind of the old admiral, who was very wealthy, and who, from what he has already said and done, no doubt fully intended to provide handsomely for the Bannerworth family. And not only had they this to look for- ward to, if they had chosen to regard it as au advantage, but they knew that by the marriage of Fjora with Charles Hol- land she would have a fortune at her dis- posal, while he (Charles) would be the last man in the world to demur at any reasonable amount of it being lavished upon her mother and her brothers. But all this did not suit the high and independent spirit of Henry Bannerworth. He was one who would rather have eaten the crust that he procured for himself by some meritorious exertion, than have feasted on the most delicate viands placed before j him from the resources of another. In this view of the case he was not alone, sor a family more unselfish, or who cared so little for money, could scarcely have been sound ; but Admiral Bell and Charles Hol- land argued now that they had a right to the amount- ot money which Marmaduke Bannerworth had hidden somewhere, and the old admiral reasoned upon it rather ingeniously, for he said\u2014 \u25a0 \"I suppose you don't mean to dispute that the money belongs to somebody, and in that case I should like to know who else it belonged to if not to you? How do you get over that, Master Henry?\" \" I don't attempt to get over it at all,\" said Henry ; \" all I say is, that I do dislike the whole circumstances connected with it, and the manner in which it was come by ; and, now that we have a small indepen- dence, I hope it will not be found. But, admiral, we are going to hold a family consultation as to what we shall do, and what is to become of Varney. He has convinced me of his relationship to our family, and, although his conduct bas cer- tainly been extremely equivocal, he has made all the amends iu his power -, and now, as he is getting old, I do not like to throw him upon the wide world for a sub- sis ten cc \" You don't contemplate,\" said thc ad- miral, \"letting him remain with you, do you?\" '. \" No ; that would be objectionable for a variety of reasons ; and I c *uld not think of it for a moment.\""], [380, "VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE; OR, 370 \u00ab I should think not.

I think Varney fully means what he says ; but I think, at the same time, that he has for io long led a strange, wild, and reckless life, that he will find it very far from easy, if in deed possible, to shake off his old habits and settle down quietly, if not to say com fortably.\" \" I regret,\" said Henry, \" that you have such an impression ; but while I do so, I cannot help admitting that it is, to a consi derable extent, no more than a reasonable one; and perhaps, after all, my expecta tion that Varney will give us no more trou ble, only amounts to a hope that he will not do so, and nothing more. But let us consider; there seems to bo some slight difference of opinion among us, as to whether we should take up our residence at this new house of ours, which we did not know we owned, at Dearbrook, or pro ceed to London, and there establish our selves, or again return to Bannerworth Hall, and there, by a judicious expenditure of some money, make that a more habit able place than it has been for the last twenty years.\" \" Now, I'll tell you what\" said the ad miral, \" I would do. It's quite out of the question for anybody to live long unless they see a ship; don't you think so, Miss Flora?\" \"Did you?

Circum stances seem to have thrown him com pletely at our mercy. What are we to do with him, and what is to become of him for the future?\" \" I'll tell you what I'll do,\" said the ad miral. \" If he were ten times a vampyre, there is some good in the fellow; and I will give him enough to live upon if he will go to America and spend it. They will take good care there that he sucks no blood out of them; for, although an American would always rather lose a drop of blood than a dollar, they keep a pretty sharp look out upon both.\" \" The proposal can be made to him,\" said Henry, \" at aU events. It is oue which I don't dislike, and probably one that he would embrace at once ; because he seems to me to have completely done with ambi tion and to have abandoned those projects concerning which, at one time, he took such a world of trouble.\" \"Don't you trust to that,\" said the ad miral. \" What's bred in the bone don't so easUy get out of the flesh ; and once or twice, when Master Varney has been talk ing, I have seen those odd looking eyes of his flash up for a moment, as if he were quite ready to begin his old capers again, and alarm the whole country side.\" \" I must confess,\" said Charles Holland, \"that I myself have had the impression once or twice that Varney was only subdued sor a time, and that, with a proper amount of provocation, he would become again a very serious fellow, and to the fuU as trou blesome as he has been.\" \" Why, how can you ask Flora such a question, uncle,\" said Charles Holland, \" when you know she don't care a straw about ships, and only looks upon admirals at natural curiosities?\" \" Excepting one,\" said Flora, \" and he is an admiral who is natural but no curiosity, unless it be tbat you can caU him such be cause he is so just and generous ; and, as for ships, who can help admiring them? and if Admiral Bell proposes that we five in some pleasant, marine villa by the sea coast, he shaU have my vote and interest for the procedding.\" \"Bravo! Huzza!\" cried the admiral. \" I tell you what it is, Master Charley \u2014 you horse marine \u2014 I have a great mind to cut you out, and have Miss Flora myself.\" \"Don't, uncle,\" said Charles; \"that would be so very cruel, after she has pro mised me so faithfully. How do you sup pose I should Uke it?

THE MISADVENTURE OF TUB DOCtOB WITH THE PICTURE. he situation of Dr. Chilling. worth and Jack Priugle was not of that character that permitted much conver- sation or even congratula tion. They were victors it Hi __**Jrp-*\u00bb was truc' aa^ v >\u25a0/ yet they had but little to boast of besides the victory. Victory is a great thing ; it is like a gilded coat, it bewilders and dazzles. No- body can say much when you are victorious. What a sound 1 and yet how much misery is there not hidden beneath it. This victory ofthe worthy doctor and his aid amounted to this, they were as they were before, without being any better, but much the worse, seeing they were so much buffeted that they could hardly speak, but sat for some moments opposite to each other, gasping for breath, and staring each other in the face without speaking. The moonlight came in through the win- dow and fell npon the floor, and there were no sounds that came to disturb the stillness of the scene, nor any object that moved to cast a shadow upon the floor. All was still and motionless, save the two victors, who were much distressed and bruised. \" WeU!\" said Jack Pringle, with a hearty execration, as he wiped bis faco with the back of his hand ; \" saving your presence, doctor, we are masters of the field, doctor; but it's plaguey like capturing an empty bandbox after a hard fight.\" \" But we have got the picture, Jack\u2014 we have cot the picture, you see, and that is something.

It seems to me as if something new must have occurred to him. Altogether, I do not feel any alarm concerning his actions as regards us. I am convinced of his sincerity, and, therefore, do not view with sensations ol un- easiness this new circumstance, which ap- pears at present so inexplicable, but for which we may yet get some explanation that will be satisfactory to ns all.\" \" I cannot conceive,\" said Henry, \" what new circumstances could have occurred to produce this effect upon Varney.

He stopped short; for, on looking around him, he saw the object of his soli citude was gone. The picture was nowhere to be seen. It had been carried off tbe instant he had been vanquished. \" Gone!\" he said, in a low, disconsolate tone; \" and after all I have done !\" He wiped his hand across his brow, and finding it cut, ho looked at the back of his hand, and saw by the deep colour that it was blood; indeed, he could now feel it trickle down his face. What to do he hardly knew ; he conld staud, and after having got upon his feet, he staggered back against the wall, against which he leaned for support, and after wards be crept along with the aid of its support, until he came to the door. He was observed from the window, when Henry and Charles Holland, seeing him come up with such an unsteady gait, rusbed to the door to ascertain what was the matter. looking picture it is after all. Why, Us enough to frighten a lady into the sulks.\" \" I think, alter we have done with it, the best thing would be to consign it to the flames. But come along, Jack, and help me to carry the picture to the cottage of the Bannerworths.\" Jack rose and assisted the doctor with it from the house, and through the village, till they came to the end of the wall that bounded thc garden of the cottage, when Jack brought the doctor to a complete standstill by suddenly putting the end he cerr.ed on the ground. As Jack and the doctor had had a more than usually severe quarrel, he csnsidered it good policy to absent himself for a time. The doctor was now left alone with his burden within fifty yards of his destination. After Jack had left him, the doctor was proceeding along at a slow and steady pace, bestowing all his care and attention to the manner of holding the picture, when he was suddenly paralysed by the sound of a great shout of such a peculiar character, that he involuntarily stopped, and the next moment, something heavy came against him with great force, just as if a man had jumped from the wall on to him. This was the truth, for, in another mo ment, and before he could recover himself, he found that there was an attempt to de prive him of the picture. \" What, doctor !\" exclaimed Henry Bannerworth; \" wbat is the matter?\" \" I am almost dead, I think,\" said Chillineworth. \"Lend me your arm, Henry.\" Henry and Charles Holland imme diately stepped out, and took him between them into the parlour, and placed him upon a couch. '\u2022 What on earth has happened, doctor? \u2014 have you got into disgrace with the populace?\" \"No, no; give me some drink \u2014 some water. I am very faint \u2014 very faint.\" \" Give him somo wine, or, what's better, some grog,\" said the admiral. \" Why, he's been yard-arm with some pirate or other, and he's damaged about the figure head. You ain't hurt in your lower works, are you, doctor?\" said the admiral. But the doctor took no notice of the inquiry ; but eagerly sipped the contents of a glass that Charles Holland had poured out of a bottle containing some strong Hollands, and which appeared to nerve him much. This at once aroused him, and he made an instant and a vigorous defence; but he was compelled to let go his hold of the picture, and turn to resist the infuriated attack that was now commenced upon himself. For some moments it was doubtful who would be the victor; but the wind and strength of the doctor were not enough to resitt the powerful adversary against whom he had to contend, and the heavy blows that wero showered down upon him. At first he was enabled to bear up against this attack; and then he returned many of the blows with interest; but the stunning effects of the blows he received himself were such that he could not help himself and felt his senses gradually failing, his strength becoming less aad less. Iu a short time, he received such a blow, that he was laid senseless on the earth in an instant. \"There!\" said tho admiral, \"that will do you good. How did all this damage to your upper works come about, eb?\" \" Let him wash his face and hands first; he will be better able to talk alter. wards.\" \"Oh, thank you,\" said Chillingworth. \" I am much better; but I bave had some hard bruises.\" How long he remained thus he could not say ; but it could not have been long , for all around him seemed just as it was before he was attacked. The moon had scarcely moved, and the shadows, such as they were, were falling in the same direction as before. \" How did it happen?\" \" I went by myseif to watch in the room"], [383, "THE FEAST OF BLOcD. 373 where the picture was in Bani.erworth Hall.\" in strength. I was sadly knocked about, and finally all the senses were knocked out of me, and I was, I suppose, left sor lead.\" \" Where the picture was !\" said Henry; \" where it is, you mean, do you not, doctor?'' \" And what became of the picture J\" \" I don't know ; but I suppose it was taken away, as, when I came to myself, it was gone; indeed, I have some faint re collection of seeing bim seize the portrait as I was falling.\" There was a pause of some moments, during which all tbe party appeared to be employed with their own thoughts, and the whole were silent. \" No ; where it was, aud where it is not now.\" \"Gone!\" \" Yes, gone away; I'll tell you all about it. I went there to watch, but found nobody or nothing there ; but suddenly a man stepped out from behind the picture, and we had a fight over it; after whicb, just as I was getting the worst of it, Jack Pringle came in.\" \" The dog !\" muttered the admiral. \"Yes, he came in juetin time, I believe, to save my life ; for the man, whoever he was, would not have hesitated about it.\" \" Well, Jack is a good man,\" said the admiral ; \"there may be worse, at least.\" \" Well, we bad a desperate encounter for some minutes, during which this fellow wanted to carry off the picture.\" \"Carry off the picture?\" \" Yes ; we had a struggle for that; but we could not capture him; he was so Tiolent that he broke away and got clear off.\" \" Do you think it was the same man who attacked you in the house that obtained the picture?\" at last inquired Henry Bannerworth. \" I cannot say, but I think it most pro bable that it was tbe same; indeed, the general appearance, as near as I could tell in the dark, was the same; bnt what I look upon as much stronger is, the object ap pears to be the same in both cases.\" \" That is very true,\" said Henry Ban nerworth \u2014 \" very true ; end I think it more than probable myself. But come, doctor, you will require rest and nursing after your dangers.\" \"With the picture?\" \" No, he left the picture behind. Well, we were very tired and bruised, and we sat down to recover ourselves from our fatigue, and to consider what was best to be done ; but we were some time before we could leave, and then we determined that we would take the picture away with us, as it seemed to be coveted by the robber, for what object we cannot tell.\" \" Well, well\u2014 where is the picture?\" \" You shall hear all about it in a minute, if you'll let me take my time. I am tired and sore. Well, we brought the picture out, and Jack helped me to carry it till we came within a couple of hundred yards of the cottage, and there left me.\" \" Tbe lubber !\" said the admiral, inter- jectionally. \" Well, I rested awhile, and then taking tbe picture on my shoulders, I proceeded along with it until I came to the wall, when suddenly I heard a great shout, and then down came something heavy upon me, just as if a man had jumped down upon me.\" \"And -and \" \" Yes,\" said the doctor, \"it was \" \" Was what?\" inquired the admiral. \" Just what you all seemed to anticipate; you are all before me, but that was it.\" \" A man ?\" \" Yes; I had a struggle with him, and got nearly killed, for I was not eoual to him CHAPTER LXXXIV. THE MARRIAGE IN THE BANNERWORTH PASIILY ARRANGED. Iter the adven- ture of the doc- tor with regard to the picture, about which such an air of mystery and in terest has been thrown, the Bannerworth family began to giveupallhopes of ever finding a clue to those circumstances concerning which they would certainly have liked to have known the truth, but of which it was not likely they would ever hear anything more. Dr. Chillingworth now had no reserve, and when he had recovered sufficiently to feel that he could converse without an effort, he took an opportunity, while the whole ot the family were present, to speak of what had been his hopes and his expectations. \"You are all aware,\" he said, ' now of the story of Marmaduke Bannerworth, and"], [384, "374 VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE. what an excessively troublesome person he was, with all deference to you, Henry ; first of all, as to spending all his money at the gaming-table, and leaving his family destitute ; and then, wheu he did get a lump of money, which might bave done some good to those left behind him \u2014 biding it somewhere where it could not be sound at all, and so leaving you all in great difficulty and distress, when yon might have been independent.\" \"That's true enough, doctor,\" said Henry ; \" but yon know the old proverb\u2014 tbat ill-gotten wealth never thrives ; so that I don't regret not finding this money, sor I am sure we should have been none the happier with it, and perhaps not so happy.\" \" Oh, bother the old proverb ; thirty or forty thousand pounds is no trifle to be talked lightly of, or the loss of which to be quietly put up with, on account of a musty proverb. It's a large sum, and I should like to have placed it in your bands.\" with it ; but now it has got into the hands of somebody else, wbo knows, I suspect, as much as I do.\" \" It is rather provoking.\" \"Rather provoking 1 is that the way to talk of the loss of Heaven knows now many thousands of pounds? I am quite aggravated myself at the idea of the thing, and it puts me in a perfect fever to think of it, I can assure you.\" \" But what can we do?\" \" Oh ! I propose an immediate crusade against Varney, the vampyre, for who but he could have made such an attack upon me, and force me to deliver up such a valuable treasure?\" \"Never heed it, doctor,\" said Flora; \" let it go ; we have never had or enjoyed that money, so it cannot matter, and it is not to be considered as the loss of an actual possession, because we never did actually possess it.\" \"Yes,\" chimed in the admiral ; \"bother the money ! what do we care about it ? and, besides, Charley HoUand is going to be very busy.\" \" Bu9y !\" said the doctor ; \" how do you mean?\" \" But as you cannot, doctor, there can be no good possibly done by regretting it.\" \" No, certainly; I don't mean that; utter regret is always a very foolish thing ; but it's questionable whether something might not be done in the matter, after all, for you, as it appears, by all the evidence we can collect, that it must have been Varney, after all, who jumped down upon me from the garden- wall in so sudden a manner ; and, if the picture be valuable to him, it must be valuable to as.\" \" Why, isn't he going to be married directly to Flora, here, and am I not going to settle the whole of my property upon him on condition that he takes the name of Bell instead of Holland? for, you see, his mother was my sister, and of course her name was BeU. As sor his father Holland, it can't matter to him now what Charley is called ; and if he don't take the name of Bell I shall be the last in the family, for I am not likely to marry, and have any little Bells about me.\" * * * \u2022 \" But how are we to get it, and, if we could, 1 do not see that it would be of much value to anybody, for, after all, it is but a painting.\" \" There you go again,\" said the doctor, \"depreciating what you know nothing about ; now, listen to me, Master Henry, and I will tell you. That picture evidently had some sort of lining at the back, over the original canvas ; and do you think I would have taken such pains to bring it away with me if that Uning had not made me suspect that between it and the original picture the money, in bank notes, was deposited?\" \" Had you any special reason for sup posing such was the case?\" \"\\ea ; most unquestionably I had; for when I got tbe picture fairly down I found various inequalities in the surface of the back, which led me to believe that rolls of notes were deposited, and that the great mistake we hil all along made was in looking behind the picture, instead of at the picture itself. I meant immediately to have cut it to pieces when I reached here Shortly after Varney the vampyre's dis appearance from the neighbourhood of Bannerworth Hall, preparations were made sor the nuptials ot Charles Holland and Flora. The admiral took upon him self to superintend the arrangement, and well he executed his self-imposed task, for a more magnificent or happier wedding had not been known to have occurred within the memory of the oldest inhabi tant of the village. From the time of Varney's encounter with Dr. ChUlingworth over the picture, he was no more heard of in that locality. That it was he that had robbed the doctor, and had become possessed of the large treasure that was concealed between the outer lining and the picture, there could be no doubt whatever; for what intelli gence reached the Bannerworth family tended to confirm them in the identity of Varney, who they heard of from time to '"], [385, "VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE; OR, THE FEAST OF BLOOD. 375 time spent in fruitless efforts to support his sinking frame by the blood of the pure and gcod, he determined again to try to put an end to that existence which he had uneasily borne for so many years. He ac cordingly took his passage in a ship then lying in the Thames, and which was bound time, living in a style of magnificence that only an ample fortune could support.

In this boat weae two young men, and from their appearance they evidently belonged to the wealthier class of society. They were brothers. From their conversation we shall gather the circumstances that threw them into such a situation, not by any means divested of peril as it was. \" Well, Edwin,\" said one, \" here we have been beating about for five hours, trying to get in shore, and all our little bark permits us to do is I think not materially to in crease our distance from home.\" \"Yes, if no storm arises, or such a gale as might founder our boat. There, there is the moon.\" \" Yes, and she will soon be overtaken by yon bank of clouds that seem to be scudding after her in the blue heavens. Ha! a sail, by Jove !\" \" Where? where?\" \" That is about the truth, Charles,\" said the other, \" and it was my fault.\" \"Crime, Edwin, don't talk in that way. There is no fault in tbe matter; how could you kuow that the wind would stiffen into such a breeze as it has, so that we cannot li^lit out against it: or if there be fault, of course it's as much mine as yours, for am not I here, and do I not know full well what an amount of consternation there will be at tho Grange?\" \" Not I think above four miles there to the east, by our little compass, which it is a thousand mercies we have with us.

Fire your fowling-piece, and the sound may reach her, the wind is good for carrying it.\" \" There will, indeed !\" \" Well, their joy when we get back wUl be all the greater.\" \" Shall we get back?\" \"Can you ask? Look at our little boat, is she not sea-worthy? Does she not dance on the waves merrily? It is only the wind, after all, that baffles us ; if it would dr op a little, we could, I think, make head against it with the oars.\" The brothers were silent now for a few moments, for ihey were each looking at the weather. At length Edwin spoke, say ing,\u2014 \" We shall have the moon up, and that may make a change.\" \" Very likely \u2014 very likely. There is not, I think, quite so much sea as there wa-:; suppose we try the oars again?\" The other assented, and the two young men exerted themselves very much to de crease their distance from the Suffolk coast by pulling away right manfully, but it was quite evident to them that they did no good, and that they had just as well dropped westward as they had been doing, by keeping the sail set, and steering as near as possible to tho wind. \" Why, if this goes on, Charles, where shall we get to by tho morning?\" \"To Northumberland, peihaps.\" \"Or further.\" Charles took a fowling-piece from the bottom of the boat. The brothers had merely gone out at sunset or a little before it, to shoot gulls, and he tried to discharge the piece, but several seas that they had shipped, while they were thinking of other things than keeping the gun dry, had, for the time being, most effectively prevented it from being discharged. \"Ah!\" said Edwin as he heard the click ofthe lock, \"that hope is lost.\" \" It is, indeed, and to my thinking the ship is distancing us rapidly. You sec our mast and sail will, at even this distance, lie so low in the horizon that they will hardly see us unless they are sweeping the sky with a night glass.\" \"And that is not likely.\" \" Certainly not, so we bave nothing for [ it but to hold on our way.

There is some current hereabouts, for you see it comes to us against the wind.\" \" Don't deceive yourself, brother.

What a length he is to be sure.\" The body was nearly alongside tbe boat, and one of the brothers detained it with a boat-hook, while they bothlooked earnestly To this Charles agreed, and it was re marked by them both as a strange thing that from the moment of their taking in the dead body to the boat, the wind dropped, and finally there was almost a culm, after which there camo a soft gentle air from the south-east, which enabled them with scarcely any exertion on their Own parts to make great progress towards their own home, from which they found they had not by any means been driven so far northward as they had at first thought. The brother's looked at each other, and it was Edwin who broke the silence, and put into words what both thought, by saying, \u2014 \" Charles, there is something more in this whole affair than what lies just upon at it. It was the body of a man, remarkably well dressed, and had no appearance of having been in the water long. The fea tures, as far as they could see them, were calm and composed.

Oh, how very different their sensations were now to what they had been when they were beating about at the mercy of the winds and waves, but a few short hours since, and when it certainly was but an even chance with death whether they would ever see their home again. If a gale bad sprung up, accompanied by anything in tbe shape of a very heavy sea, they must have been lost. Soon they saw that their boat was des cried, and at a particular portion of the coast there stood a complete cluster of men with torches, inviting them there to land, and they knew that such landing-place was upon their father's property, and that in a few minutes they would be safe on shore. The joy that the return of the brothers caused in the family, our readers may weU imagine. The sisters Clara and Emma wept abundantly, and the mother, who had let ber sears go further than any one else, was deeply affected. But it is time that we should inform tbe reader who these people were, whom we have introduced upon the scene ot our eventful history. Sir George Crofton, for such was the name ofthe father of Edwin and Charles, was a wealthy warm-hearted country gen tleman, and constantly resided upon his own estate all the year round, being a good landlord to his tenantry, and a good father to his four children, who have already been to some extent presented to tbe reader. Neither of them spoke, bnt reflection was busy in the hearts of both. There was a loud and thoroughly Eng glish shout, as the boat grated upon the sandy beach, and Edwin and Charles jumped on shore. They were in auother moment pressed in their father's arms. \"Why, why, boys,'' be said, \"what a fright you have given us all; there's Clara and Emma have been forced \u2014 I say forced, for nothing but force would do it\u2014 to go home, and the whole country has been in an uproar. You were blown out to sea, I suppose ?\" \" Yes, father, but we have not been in any danger.\" \" Not in any danger with such a cockle shell of a boat fairly out into the German Ocean? But we will say no more about it, lads. Not another word ; come home at once, and make all hearts glad at the old (Jrange House,\" \"There's something in the boat,\" cried ppe ol tha men who hold a light. \"Uosd God, tm !\" exclaimed GharJea. \u2022M fqreotf9PrH said 15-iwiOj \"wa mot wit!) a little . }_?. $\u00ab\u00bb, find It mir The mother was a kind-hearted, but rather weak woman, with an evangeUcal bias that at times was rather annoying to tbe family. This, however, was perhaps the good lady's own fault, for with that one excep tion, she was fond of her children to ex cess, notwithstanding, as Sir George some times jestingly said, he verily believed she in her heart considered they were all on the high road to a nameless abode. The night was so far advanced when the young men got home that, of course, not much was said or done, and among other things that were put off until the follow ing morning was the story of the finding of the body. \"There is no occasion,\" whispered Sir George, \"to say anything to your ssuther about iy.\" \" Certainly not, father,\" \"At least not till to-morrow, fo? if you fo I ib*!! not get a wink of slesp so? hef signs os the cutout,\" Tha Its rouBgiwnkBJwwiy will Bil mm esfte-sww-ion, sm. that llivit"], [389, "THE FEAST OF BLOOD. 379 desire to protract a conversation with the sexton, and he called in vain after them to give him some further information upon the subject of this rather mysterious infor mation. mother would, like any divine, eagerly seize the opportunity of what is called \" improving the occasion\" by indulging in a long discourse upon the most dismal of all subjects that the mind of any human being can conceive, namely, the probability of everybody going to eternal perdition unless they believe in a particular set of doctrines that to her seem orthodox. \"A drowned man,\" he pondered to him self; \"a drowned man, and with fingers loaded with gems, and brought to the bone house?

The consequence of this was that the dead body was quietly taken out of the boat by men who did not possess the most refined feelings in the world, and cairied to the bone-house. \" He seems a decent sort of chap,\" said one, as he looked at the very respectable habiliments of the corpse. \"Ah! look at the gould rings.\" \" Yes, you may look, Abel, but eyes on, hands off.\" \"Why?\" \" Wh y, you gowk, d o you think as young Ma'ter Charles and Edwin don't know of 'em, and more besides, who would touch dead men's gold off of his fingers?\" \"Is it unlucky?\" \"Horrid!\" CHAPTER LXXXVI.

These were mental ruminations, tho re sult of whioh wan transparent from tha first, for th\u00bb*5 -rewls io the mm\\ oriiw nf \"Hilloa! you ragamuffins, what do you mean by hammering away at an honest man's door at this rate, eh?

I can't make it out to be anything else, I'm sure.\" \" It ain't far off morning now,\" he rea soned with himself, \" so I may as well get up at once as lie here tossing and tumbling about, and certainly unable to get another wink of sleep; and besides, after all, I may be wrong in thinking this a hoax. There may really be such a dead body as those fellows mentioned in the bone-house, and if there be, I ought certainly to go and look after it.\" We easily reason ourselves into what is our pleasure, and so while these cogitatory remarks were uttered by tbe sexton, he rose. Thus reasoning with himself upon bis own unwonted timidity, he reached the bone-house. Ihe door of the dUapidated building which was known by that name, was only secured by a latch, for it was not considered that the contents of the place were suffi ciently interesting for any one's cupidity lo be excited by it. The sexton paused a moment before he lifted the latcb, and glanced around him. Even then he half expected to hear a loud laugh expressive of the triumph of those who had combined to play him the trick, if it were one, of getting him out of his bed on a bootless errand. But all was still around him\u2014 still as the very grave itself, and muttering then iu a hurried tone, \" It is true, there is no trick,\" he hastily opened the door, and went into the bone-house. He found that if he drew back the blind from before his window, the moon, which was now sailing through a nearly cloudless sky, would give him amply sufficient light to enable bim to go through the process of dressing, so be at once began that opera tion. \" Yes,\" he said, \" I ought to go, it's my positive duty to do so, after getting the information I have; and if that informa tion be untrue, let it recoil on the heads of those who invented the falsehood. I shall go, that's settled. What a sweet moon light.\" It was a sweet moonlight, indeed. The floods of soft 6ilvery light fell with an un common radiance upon all objects, and the minutest thing could have been seen upon the ground, with the same clearness and distinctness as at mid-day. Tbe only difference was that a soft pre ternatural-looking atmosphere seemed to be around everything, and a kind of mar ble-like look was imparted to all objects far and near on which those soft silvery rays rested in beauty and sublimity. The sexton was full dressed, and although the moonlight guided him well, he thought that he might in the bone-house require another mode of illumination, and he Ughted and took with him a small lantern which had a darkening shade to it. Thus piepared, he walked at a rapid pace from bis own house towards the small shed-hke building which served as a re ceptacle for the unowned dead, and for such human remains as were from time to time cast ashore by the waves, or flung up from new graves by the spade and the mattock. All was darkness save one broad beam of moonlight that came in at the doorway, but the sexton closed the entrance, and applied to his lantern for a light. He slid the darkening piece of metal from before the magnifying glass, and then a rather sickly ray of light fell for a moment upon the corpse that lay there upon its back \u2014 a ray only sufficiently strong and suffi ciently enduring to enable the sexton io make quite sure that there was a body before him, and then his lantern went out. \" Confound the lantern !\" he said, \" I ought to have looked to it before I started, instead of lighting it on the mere hazard of its going on comfortably. What's to be done? Ah, I havo it, I remember.\" What the sexton remembered was that on the same wall in which the door was situated, there was a large square aperture only covered by a kind of shutter of wood, the withdrawal of a bolt from which would cause it to fall in a moment on its hinges. The sexton knew the place well, aud drawing back the somewhat rusty bolt, down went the shutter, and a broad flood of moonlight fell at once npon the corpse. \"Ah,\" said Will Stephens, \"there it is sure enough. What a long odd-looking fellow to be sure, and what a face \u2014 how thin and careworn looking. I do very Familiar as be was and bad been for many a year with that bone-house, and often in contact with the dead, he yet on this occasion felt as if a strange fear was j uch wonder now who he really is?\""], [391, "THE FEAST OF BLOOD. 381 As he continued to gaze upon the dead body, his eyes wandered to ihe hands, and there sure enough he saw the blight and glittering gems the men had spoken of, and which the salt water had not been able to tarnish into dimness. Perceiving that the setting was gold and the stones real, \u2014 '* Ahem !\"\u25a0 said Stephens, softly ; \"thev will not bury the corpse with those rings on his sinacrs. Why, he must ha7e half a-dnzen on at least ; they will be some body's perquisite of course, and that some body wou'c be me. The idea of leaving such property unprotected in a bone house !\" he could just then summon to his aid, he advanced close to the corpse. Kneeling on one knee he took up one of the hands from which he wished to take the rings, and when ho saw them closer, he felt convinced that they did not belie their appearance, but were in reality what they seemed to be \u2014 jewels of rarity and price. The hand was cold and clammy and damp to the touch, and the knuckles were swollen, so that there was great difficulty in getting the rings over them, aud the sexton was full five minutes getting one of them off. When he had done so, he wiped the perspiration of sear and excitement from bis bvow, as he muttered \u2014 \" That's always the case with your drowned folks, they are so swelled when first they come out of the water, and so I shall have quite a jib, I suppose.\" The sexton's er.pidity was, however, now sufficiently awakened, to make him perse vere, despite such obstacles, iu wbat he was about, and accordingly, kneeling on both knees, he clasped the wrist of the dead man in one hand, and with the other strove to coax off by twisting the hoop of gold round and round, a ring that had one diamond, apparently of great value, set iu it, and which the robber of the dead thought was a prize worth some trouble in the obtaining. In an instant, the dead hand clasped him tight. Will Stephens remained now silent for a short time, moving his head about in different directions, so that he canght the bright colours of the jewels that adorned the dead man's bauds, and then he spoke again. \" What's more easy,\" said he, \" than for some of the very fellows who brought him hi* *, to Slip back quietly, and take away every one of those rings?\" After this much, he went to the door of the bone-house and listened, but all was perfectly still ; and then his cogitations assumed another shape. \" Who saw me come from my house ?\" he said. \u2014 \" Nobody. Who will see me go back to it? \u2014 Nobody. Then what is to hinder me from taking the rings, and \u2014 and letting the blame lie on some one else's shoulders, I should like to know? Nothing will be easier than for me to say in the morning that owing to the strange and insolent manner in which the informa tion was given me of the arrival of the dead body in the bone-house, I did not believe it, and therefore did not rise, and so \u2014 so I think I may as well, eh?\" lie thought he heard something like a faint si,'h, and the teeth chattered in his bead, and he shook in every limb as he bent all his energies to the task of listening if there were really any one in the place or at hand, who should be playing the spy upon him. All was, as before, profoundly still, and with a long breath of relief, he cast off his f * ror CHAPTER LXXXVII. THE RECOVERY. \u2014 THE SEXTOn's FRIG3T.

How long he and the dead man remained in this way together in silence, he knew not, but he aroused from the state of almost frenzy in which he wa9, by a deep sepul chral voice\u2014 the voice of the apparently dead. \" To borrow a ring of you, that's all, and the greatest calamity that ever happened to me is your coming to life.\" \" How came I here?\" \" That I can't tell, your worship.

Oh \u2014 oh\u2014 oh\u2014 have mercy upon me, I \u2014 I \u2014 implore you.\" The only reply was a frightful groan. The perspiration rolled down the sexton's face. \"Oh, don't\u2014 oh, pray don't\u2014 hold\u2014 hold me so\u2014 so tight.\" \" Now,\" said the dead man, \" I know all.

It you promise me that you will keep all that has happened a secret, except so much of it as I shaU empower you to reveal, I will spare you ; but if, after having so promised, you break faith with me, and let your tongue wag further than I wish if, you will not live twenty four hours afterwards, be assured, for I will find you out, and twist your head from your shoulders.\" \" Anything, sir, I will promise anything, I will swear if you like.\" \"I heed no oaths.

Here's your ring, I don't want to keep it. Here's the only one I took off your worshipful fingers, good Mr. Ghost.\" A very thin filmy sort of cloud had been going over the moon's disc, but now had passed completely away, and such a flood of unchecked, untempered brilliancy poured in at the open window, if it might be so called, of the dead-house, that it became quite radiant with the silvery beams. The drowned man rose with a wild howling cry of rage, and, springing at the throat of the sexton, bore him down to the earth in an instant, and placed his knee upon his chest. \" Villain,\" be groaned out, between his clenched teeth, \"you shall die, although you have made me live. There shaU be one victim to the fell destroyer.\" The sexton thought his hour was come. He took his knee off the chest of the sexton and his hand off bis throat, and then Will Stephens tremblingly rose to his feet. The idea did cross him for a moment of measuring his strength with the resus cited man, but when he beheld the tall, bony, gaun( figure before him, he saw he had not the shadow of a chance in a per sonal struggle. Moreover, he had a lively remembrance of a most vice-like pressure upon his \"Wretch !\" pursued the revived corpse, \" wretch, what devil prompted you to do this most damnable deed?

Upon the whole, then, the sexton was glad to have escaped so well. \" You have only to say, sir, what you would have me do,\" he said. \" Answer me first. Have you always lived here? Is this your native place?\" \" Oh, no, sir, I came from London ; but then it's years ago.\" \"Very well. You must say that you remember me in London, as a gentleman of good repute, and you must add that you vampvre's DREAM. THE now toll me minutely how I was rescued from the ocean, or did the waves them selves give up their dead?\" The sexton, who was now assured in his own miud that it was no ghost he was speaking to, entered as far as he knew in to the story of the finding the body, and bringing it to the bone-house, but as that came to the bone-house, and found me re living, and that you took measures to complete my recovery\" \" Yes, sir.

Smith would go with him to his cottage, to get him all the particulars. To this the other consented, and they both left the bone-house together. On the short bit of road, the sexton be gan to think that his companion must be some madman, for ever and anon when the moon was brightest, he saw him lift up both his arms to it, as if he were worshipping it, and at those times too he heard him mutter some words in a lan guage that he did not comprehend. At length the singular being spoke in English. \"Henceforth,\" he cried, as if quite for getful of the presence of another, \" hence forth, begone remorse, begone despair. The great sea has rejected me, and not again will I seek destruction ; I will live, and I will live to be the bane and the curse of the beautiful.\" CHAPTER LXXXVIII. THE NIGHT ALARM. \u2014 THE VAMPYBb'e ATTACK UPON THE BRIDE. he particulars concerning tho bringing in of the body that had been picked up at sea by the brothers Edwin and Charles Crofton, were to be learnt from many mouths so soon as the sexton evinced a dis- position to know them, and in a very short space of time, and as the daylight was making the fainter and the more spiritual light of the moon fade away, he again reached his own abode, where he hud left a guest of whom the reader knows mucb, but of whom Will Stephens knew but little. \"Sir,\" said tbe sexton, \"here is my bouse, sir ; if you will step in, I will soon dish you up a little something in the way of refreshment. You see, sir, I live alone, that is to say, an old woman who keeps my cottage in order and waits npon me goes away at night, and comes again in the morning ; but as it is not time yet, I will get you anything you like to eat or to drink.\" He found the self-christened Mr. Smith waiting for him rather impatiently. \" Well,\" he cried, \" your news ? your news ?\" \"I never eat nor drink.\" \" May be told, sir, in a few words,\" re plied the sexton, and then he made his new friend acquainted with the whole story, just as he had heard it of the fishermen on the coast. \" Not eat !\u2014 nor drink ! Never, sir ?\" \" Never. I shall cost you nothing to entertain me. I want some rest, and while I am taking it do you go and get me such information as you can regarding me. Make no concealment that I am alive, but go at once and return with what expedi tion you may, and remember that your fate is in my hands.\" \" I will, sir.\" The sexton was quite terrified enough to do what he was bidden, and, perhaps, the consciousness that the strange and mysterious man whom he had for a guest might accuse him of the projected robbery of the jewellery he had about his person, influenced him more than the rather obscure threat of personal vengeance by the promised screwing his head off. But the matter, take it for all in all, was anything but an agreeable one for Master Will Stephens, and most heartily did he wish he had remained in his bed and left the stranger to recover, if ho was to re cover, by himself. Will did not attribute that recovery to the light he had himself let in. Mr. Smith, or as we may as well call him at once the vampyre, hesitated for a few moments as if he had not exactly and accurately made up his mind what to do, and then he said \u2014 \" You will go to the Grange House and tell the story that I have before informed you I would have told. Be sure that you expatiate upon my gentility and respect ability, for I want to be upon good terms with the Crofton family.\" \"Well, but, sir, I'm a tenant of Sir George Crofton's, and so you see \" \" What,\" said the vampyre, his eyes flashing with indignation as he spoke, \" dare you dispute my positive com mands ?\" \" No, sir, I\u2014 I only \" \" Peace, caitiff, and know that I hold thy life iu my hands for your attempted robbery of me.\" The sexton trembled. That was, indeed, the weak point now of all his defences against whatever commands might be put upon him by his master, as we may now call the vampyre, although after all it was but the usual denomination of a strong"], [395, "THE FEAST OF BLOOD. 385 mind over a weak one, for there was not so much in reality for the sexton to be afraid of as his own guilty conscience dic tated to him. you will go and give our compliments to the stranger, and ask him to come here, I shall he much obliged to you.\" \"I will, Sir George.\" \"And you can tell him that we are plain folks, but assure him of a hearty wel come.\" It were easy enough for the vampyre to charge him with robbery, but not at all so easy sor him to prove such a charge, and at the same time to substantiate, as by some inquisitive counsel he might be called upon to do, his own position in society. But it is most true Will Stephens made his bow and exit. \"WeU,\" said Edwin, \"it's very odd, although, of course, it must be all right, and I am the last person who would wish to make anything out of a common-place event, but to all appearances dead ho was when we took him into the boat, and I never before heard of a spontaneous re covery like this from such a state.\" \" Then you have added to your stock of experience,\" said his father, laughing, \"and I must own, for my own part, that I am rather curious to see this person, who was a curiosity in appearance according to your accounts when he was dead or supposed to be dead.\" \" Conscience doth make cowards of us all.\" And feeling that his intention regarding the rings of the supposed drowned man had been of a dishonest character, he could not summon courage sufficient to defy him now. \" I will go,\" he said, \" I am goine.\" \" 'Tis well.\" In far from the pleasantest train of thought the sexton went to the Grange, and asked to see Mr. Charles Crofton, and to him he related the version of the resus citation of the supposed drowned man. It was heard with, ns might be expected, the most profound astonishment, and the sex ton soon found himself confronted with tbe whole assembled family, and forced to re peat the wonderful facts over again. It seemed, as indeed it might well do, a something quite beyond belief. \" Why, Edwin,\" said Charles, \"he must have been in the water far beyond the length of time that it mostly takes to drown any one, be! ore we saw bim.\" \"I think so too.\" \" He was so,\" remarked Charles, \"for I am certain you might travel the world over without meeting a more singular lookirig man than he was ; in the first place, he looked particularly tall, but that might have arisen from the fact that we only saw him in a horizontal position, and then there was a something about the expression of his face which was perfectly indescribable, and yet at the same time filled you with feelings of curiosity and dread.\" The sisters heard this account of the mysterious stranger with feehngs of great interest. \" It must be so, for this reason, that he was a considerable distance from land, and there was no vessel near enough for him to have come from.\" \" Why,\" said Emma, \" we have all of us often complained of being dnll here, but such an animal as this wilTbe quite an acquisition.\" \" And just as Clara is going, too, what a pity,\" laughed Edwin. \"I shall endeavour to survive the horrid disappointment,\" said Clara, for she was to be married on that day, to one who had been the chosen companion of her heart for many a day, and was to leave the home of her childhood to proceed far away to his house in Wales, where she was to be the light of joy to another admiring and loving circle. \"Hold !\" said Sir George Crofton, \"my dear boys you are forgetting the most im portant fact of all.\" \" Are we, father?\" \" Yes, and that is that tbe gentlemen is alive. You cannot get over that, you know and as I have often heard that whatever is is natural, why there's no use in disputing any more about it ; and, besides, how do we know but that he was in some boat which was swamped but a few minutes be fore you saw him?\" \" That is a most rational supposition,\" said Edwin. \" Ah, well, I pity you,\" said Emma. \" Then you had better at once,\" re marked Clara, \"forbid the occasional visits here of a certain young offieer who, I'm afraid, has some audacious inten tions.\" The ready colour flushed to the cheek of the younger sister, who had scarcely expected such a retort, although she had fairly provoked it. \"Come, girls,\" said the father, \"we will \" And that we can say nothing against,\" added Charles ; \" what is to be done, father ?\" \" Why, do not let us do good by inches, we know that this is the only decent house within a considerable distance for a gentle- | man to remain in, if he have the habits of comfort about him. So, Master Stephen, if j"], [396, "VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE; OR, 386 have no more lance-breaking between yon about your lovers.\" \" Certainly not, father,\" said Clara, \"bnt then, you know, unle3S Emma is made to see that she is vulnerable, she will go on tormenting me.\" CHAPTER LXXX1X.

I pencd, though, it would have been better as grange quickly \" In other words, Emma,\" said Edwin, \"you see that people who live in glass houses should not throw stones\u2014 a most useful maxim.\" \"I don't care for any of yon,\" said Emma, half crying, as she ran out of the room. Clara followed her, for there was really the very best understanding and the kindest feeling between the two young girls, al though occasionally a smart repartee weuld be uttered upon some such occasion as the present, but all that was soon for gotten. The sexton who was getting each mo ment more and more nneasy about the share he bad in the affair of the resusci tated man of the bone-house, went back to the cottage, and there informed tbe self named Mr. Smith of the success of bis mission to the Grange-house. that he should have taken the sexton with him, for the cliffs that were close at hand concealed to the eye many deep gulleys and frightful precipices that had to be coasted round, before any one conld reach the Grange-house by that route. If he conld have gone directly onward, about half a mile's walking would have sufficed to enable him to reach the place, but before he had proceeded a quarter of that distance, he came npon a deep ravine or splitting in the cliff, too wide to jump across, and with all the appearance of ex tending inland a considerable distance without narrowing. \" I had indeed better have brought a guide with me,\" muttered Varney. He then paused for a few moments, as if he were debating w ith himself whether or not he should return back and get the sexton. But the mental hesitation did not last long, and accustomed as he was to trust to his own sagacity and his own re sources more than to other people, he walked along by the side of the flssnre in the cliff, muttering to himself,\u2014 \" Were all the guides in the country here, they conld but do as I am doing, namely, walk on until the ravine closes.\" With this idea he pursued it, but to his mortification he found that it widened in stead of presenting the least symptoms of closing, and suddenly it opened to his eyes to a width of about fifty feet, and he paused again irresolute. \" How am I to proceed?\" he said; \" this ii a perplexity.\" He advanced close to the brink, and looked down. The depth was very con siderable, and at the bottom there was evi dently a road made of sand and chalk, which wound down somewhere from the interior of the country to the sea-beach. \" You think they will welcome me?\" said the vampyre. \"I am sure of it, sir. They are the frankest, freest family I ever knew, and they would not have asked you to go to the Grange if they did not mean to use you well.\" \" And there are two daughters?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"And young and fair, you tell me.\" \" They are two as handsome girls as vou will find in this part of the country, 'sir. They have always been much admired. One of them, as I before mentioned, is going to be married and taken away, but the other stays at home.\" \" 'Tis well; now you will not fail to re member the awkward situation in which you are. Keep the ring which yon took from my finger, and with it keep yonr own counsel, for any babbling upon your part will most assuredly lead to your destruc tion.\" \" Yes, sir, I know.\" \" And although that destruction might not be immediate, you would lead a life of trembling terror until your doom was ac complished, and that doom should be a dreadful one in its manner. Now farewell' farewell ! and remember me.\" \"I shall never forget you the longest day I have got to live,\" said the sexton, with a shudder, as he saw the tal), angular gaunt-looking form of his most mysterious new acquaintance leave his cottage, and make his way towards the Grange"], [397, "THE FEAST OF BLOOD. 387 As he looked, he heard the rapid sound of a horse's feet. which he had spoken the words. Then sus. soring his hands slowly to fall, again he looked cold, and passionless, as he had been before. In another moment there dashed down the road towards the sea a horse, bearing on his back a man, who was exerting him self in every possible way to stop the mad dened, headlong career of the animal, bnt it would not be checked. AVith starting eyes and dilated nostrils, and with its flanks covered with foam, the frighted steed, which had evidently come some distance in that state, rushed on, but the broken nature of the ground made it almost impossible that it should make such great 6peed then as it had been making, at least with any degree of safety. This was what occurred to the thoughts of Varney, and it was sufficiently proved to be a correct idea, by the horse stumbling the next moment, and throwing his rider heavily upon the sand and broken rock that was strewn around. The steed, now disincumbCred of itsload, recovered itself in a moment, and with a snort of rage and probably of pain likewise, dashed on and disappeared from the sight round the abrupt corner of the ravine to the left band of the beach. \" So be it,\" said tho vampyre, calmly; \" another being is snatched away from the muster roll of the living, one who per haps would gladly have preserved his ex istence, while I \u2014 I remain and cannot, let me do what I will to accomplish such a purpose, shake off the cumbrous load of life that will cling to me.\" Suddenly quite a whirlwind of passion seemed to come on him, and, standing on the brink of the ravine with his arms ex tended, he cried \u2014 \"Since death is denied to me, I will henceforward shake off all human sympa thies. Since I am compelled to be that which I am, I will not be that and likewise suffer all the pangs of doing deeds at which a better nature that was within me re volted. No, I will from this time be the bane of all that is good and great and beautiful. If I am forced to wander upon the earth, a thing to be abhorred and accursed among men, I will perform my mission to the very letter as well as the spirit, and henceforth adieu all regrets, adieu all feeling\u2014 all memory of goodness \u2014 of charity to human nature, for I will be a dread and desolation! Since blood is to be my only sustenance, and since death is denied to me, I will have abundance of it\u2014 I will revel in it, and no spark of human pity shall find a home in this once racked and tortured bosom. Fate, I thee defy!\" He continued for some few moments after uttering this speech in the same attitude in But his determination was made. By looking carefully about him, be saw that there was a kind of footpath down the side of the ravine, which an active person might descend by, although, probably, not altogether without some risk, for the least false step might precipitate bim to the bottom. The vampyre, however, had no such fears. He seemed to feel that he possessed a kind of charmed life, and tbat he might adven ture to do what others might well shrink from. This feeling begot a confidence which was almost certain to be his protection, even if it had only been founded upon ima gination, for it for ;i Bed his nerves, and when he began the descent down the side of the ravine, it was without the smallest terror. He found, however, that when he was fairly on tbe path, it was a better and a wider one than he had at first supposed it to be, and in the course of five minutes he had got completely down to the narrow road, on whicb, apparently dead, lay the wounded man, for he was only grievously hurt by his fall, although he was quite in sensible. The vampyre strode up to him. \"Ah,\" ho said, \"young, and what the world would call handsome. Ha ! ha ! Heaven takes bnt little care sometimes of its handiwork.\" After a few moments' contemplation ot the still form that lay at bis feet, he knelt on one knee by its side, and placed his baud upon the region of the heart, alter roughly tearing open the vest of the stranger. \" He lives \u2014 be lives. Well, shall I crush the fluttering spirit that now is hovering 'twixt life and death, or shall I let it linger whUe it may within its-earthly prison ? Let it stay. The worst turn that any one can do another in this world, is surely to pre serve existence after once tho pang of what would be all the agony of death is pest.\" The vampyre rose, and was moving away up the ravine, when a sudden thought seemed to strike him, and he turned back again. \" Gold,\" he said, \"is alwaysusefnl to me, and I thiuk with my new thoughts and feel ings it will now be more so than ever. This insensible man may have some about him.\" Again he knelt by the side of the young man, and soon possessed himself ofa tole-"], [398, "VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE; OR, 388 rably well stocked purse that he found upon him Round his neck, too, by a thin chain of gold, hung a small portrait of a young and beautiful girl, upon which Varney gazed intently. \"Sho is fair,\" ho said, \" very fair\u2014 sho would mike a fit victim for me. I will take this portrait; it might stand me in some t-tcud should I encounter the original.\" He placed the portrait in his pocket and was in the act of rising, when ho heard the sound of a footstep. \" Ali, some one comes; it will be no part of my plan to bave been eecn by the body.\" Ho darted forth down the narrow gorge or ravine, and was soon sufficiently hidden from tho sight of those who were advanc ini_\\ They proved to be some fishermen going to spread their nets upon tho beach, which just below the spot where the seem ingly fatal accident had taken place, was as level as a carpet, screened from tbe wind, and composed of the finest sand. Of course, it was impossible to avoid seeing tho body that lay in their path, and Varney had no need to be fearful thai he would be seen, when an object of so much greater and more absorbing interest lay in their direct and unavoidable path. He heard from tho sudden exclamations that fell from them, that they had seen the body, and upon advancing a stop or two, ho found that they wero collected round it in a dense throng, for there were about a dozen men in all. \" 'Tis well,\" said Varney, \"it matters not to me if he be living or dead. I can doubt less now find my way to the Grange-house hy this path along tho shore. I will pursuo it, ot all event, and see whither it will lead me.\" He did so, and after going about half a mile, he found another ravine, which, upou entering aud ascending fora time, led him quite close to one of the entrances of the Grange-house, as it was called, and which he was so anxious to reach, CHAPTER XC.

II is passion as he uttered these worls had ia it something fearful, but in a few moments the external symptom of it passed away, and he walked slowly and to all appearance calmly enough towards thc Grange. The distance he had to go was still, as before, a deceiving one, for he had to wind round a clump of trees before he really got to the gate, which appeared to be just in sight; but at length he reached it, and \" So,\" said Varney, \" this, then, is the home of these young men who have done"], [399, "THE FEAST OF BLOOD. 389 paused as he saw an old man, who was a kind of warder there. \" Sir,\" he said \" I am glad to see you, and hope you will make yourself as much at home as if you _vere in a house of your own.\" \" Is this Sir George Crofton's?\" he said, and he threw into his voice all that silvery softness which at times had been so fasci nating to the Bannerworth family. \"It is, sir.\" \" Will you announce me?\" \".I do not leave this gate, sir, but if you go down this avenue, you will reach the mansion, and some of the servants will attend to you.\" Varney walked on. The avenue was one formed by two stately rows of chestnuts, the spreading branches of which met over head, forming a beautiful canopy, and notwithstanding that they were so near the sea\u2014 that foe to vegetation \u2014 these trees were in good truth most luxuriantly beautiful. \" There was a time,\" muttered Varney, \"when I should have admired such a spot as this ; but all that has long since passed away. I am that which I am.\" He now arrived in front of the house itself, and being perceived by one of the domestics, he was politely asked what he wanted. \"Sir,\" said Varney, \"you know how much I owe your family already, and I fear to increase the heavy debt of gra titude.\" \" Oh, you are welcome, most welcome. Stay here as long as you like ; we are rather dull at times in this isolated house, and the arrival of an intelligent guest is always an event.\" Varney bowed, and Edwin advanced. \" Mr. Smith,\" he said, \" I suppose I may almost call myself an old acquaint ance?\" \"Andi?\" said Charles. \" Gentlemen, if you be those to whom I am indebted for my preservation, I owe you my warmest thanks.\" \"Oh, think nothing of it,\" said Sir George; \"it was not at all likely that my two boys wonld see a fellow creature in such a situation, and not, dead or alive, take possession of him. Your recovery is the only remarkable thing in the whole affair.\" \" Say that Mr. Smith is here,\" was the message that Varney gave. The servant had already heard that such was the name of the person who had been rescued from the sea by his young masters Edwin and Charles, he now hastened with the information tothe diawing-room, where tbe family were assembled. \" Oh, if you please, sir, he has come.\" \" Who has come ?\" \"Very remarkable,\" said Varney. They waited a moment as if he were ex pected to make some sort of explanation of that part of the business, but as he did not, Sir George said \u2014 \" You have no idea of how you became resuscitated?\" '\u2022 Not the least.\" \"Well, that is strange, indeed.\" \" Perhaps the good fellow who afforded me an immediate shelter, applied, before that, some means of recovering suspended vitality?\" \" Oh, no. Will Stephens is to the full as much surprised as any oue. But, how ever, I dare say, to you, sir, this is not the most entertaining subject in the world, so we will say no more about it, except that we are very glad to have a living guest instead of a dead one.\" \" I much fear, from what I have heard,\" said Varney, \" that I shall bo intruding at a time like this into your family circle.\" \"The drowned man, sir, Mr. Smith.\" \" Admit him instantly.\" The servant ran back to Varney, and then politely ushered him into the large, really handsome room, in which the family sat awaiting his arrival with no small share of curiosity. What tbe sexton had said of him had excited much speculation, and the eagerness to see a man who was, as it were, a present from the sea, was extreme. \" Mr. Smith,\" announced the servant ; and Varney, with one of his courtly bows, and a smile that was half-hideous, half charming, entered. \" Oh, you allude to the marriage to-day of one ot my daughters, and that puts me in mind of really quite an omission on my part. Mr. Smith\u2014 my daughters, Clara and Emma.\" The vampyre bowed low, and the young ladies went with established graco through the ceremony of the introdoction to the remarkable personage before them. At this moment there came upon the ears of all assembled there the sound of hurried There was a decided effect produced by his appearance, and perhaps that effect is best described by the word awe. They all seemed as if they were in tbe presence of something very peculiar, if not something very superior.

The scene of confusion and general con- sternation that now ensued baffles all description, and the only person who looked calm and collected npon the occa- sion was Mr. Smith, although it was not the insulting calmness of seeming indif- ference. In a few minutes, however, Sir George himself recovered from the first shock which the intelligence had given to him, and he said \u2014 \" Where is he?\u2014 where is he? Let me go to the spot.\" \"And allow me, sir, to accompany you,\" said Varney. \" Believe me, sir, I feel deeply for the family misfortune. Let me be useful\" \" Thank yon, sir, thank you\u2014 Edwin, Charles, come with me and this gentleman, and we will see if this dreadful report be true. Let us hope that fear and ignorance have exaggerated a very simple affair into so seemingly dreadful a circumstance.\" Leaving Clara to the care of her stster and some cf the female domestics of the Grange, who were hastily summoned to attend upon her, the litle party, consisting of Sir George, his two sons, Varney, and several of the men-servants, turned from the Grange in the direction of the ravine. Their intimate acquaintance with all the neighbourhood enabled them to reach the place much sooner than Varuey thought it possible to do, and as they came within sight cf the spot where the accident had occurred, they saw a crowd of villagers and fishermen assembled. They quickened their pace, and forcing through the throng, Sir GeorgeCrofton saw his intended son-in-law, to all appearance, lying dead and bleeding on the sands. Such a sight was enough, sor a moment, to paralyse every faculty, and it really had, for a time, that effect upon Sir George. CHAPTER XCL THE SICK CHAMBER AT THE OBANQE.\u2014 THE VIGHT. 5 he dead? Is he dead -\"cried Sir George. \"We don't know, sir,\" re- plied one of the fishermen; \" some of us think he ii, and some of us think he is not\" \"What is to ba done?\" \" Have him taken at once to the Grange, father,\" said Charles, \"and let us get medical assistance ; who knows but the affair may turn out in reality very different from what it first appeared? He may be only stunned by a fall.\" \" I hope to Heaven it may be so. Can you, among you, my men, make anything like a litter to carry him on?\" This was-soon done. Some of the loose seats from some boats close at hand, aud a rough cloak or two, made a capital couch sor the dead or wounded man, as the case might be. They lifted him carefully into it, and then four of them lifted the rnde but easy and appropriate conveyance, and carried him towards the ball. \" How could this have happened?\" said Sir George. \" Perhaps I may be able to throw some light upon it,\" said Varney. \" As I came here to your hospitable house, a horse, without a rider, but caparisoned for one, passed me furiously.\" \" That must have been his horse, then,\" 1 said Charles. \" Y'ou may depend, father, he was riding on to see Clara before the hour appointed for their marriage, and has met with this accident.

As the ruddy stream fell into a crystal goblet, the young man gradually opened his eyes, and looked round him with a bewildered glare. \"Darken the room,' said Dr. JNortn; \" he is right enough, but he must be kept quiet for a day or two at all events \" What has happened?\" said the He was at once introduced to his patient, and npon a cursory examination, he \" This is a concussion of the brain, but don't let that alarm you.

He is here under this roof, and here he shall stay till he recovers, poor lad. Oh, dear no, I never thought of sending him home, but I must send some one, by-the-by, with the news of what has happened. That is well thought of.\" \" Clara!\" \" Ah, I know, and now listen to me. If you remain quiet and don't speak, you will see Clara soon; but if you are wilful and disobey orders, you will bring on a brain fever, and you won't see her at all in this world ; so now judge for yourself.\" \"You are rather harsh,\" said Sir George. \" Pardon me, sir, I am not. There is nothing like making a patient thoroughly understand his own position ; and I give this young gentleman credit lor sufficient wisdom to enable him to profit by what I say to him.\" The knowledge that her lover, and her affianced husband, was doing well, and that he was under the same roof wilh her, gave Clara tne most unalloyed satisfaction, and she recovered rapidly her good and healthful looks. It was duly explained to her, that she must not go near Ringwood to disturb him, as rest was so very essen tial to his recovery, so she did not attempt it. The whole household was commanded to be unusually quiet, and never had the Grange before presented such a collection of creeping domestics, for they went up and down stairs like so many cats. Clara did not omit to thank Mr. Smith for the assistance he had rendered them in this evil emergency, and Dr. North stood with the family in the dining-room waiting, perhaps with greater anxiety than he chose to express, the awaking of his patient. A servant was left in the adjoining chamber to that occupied by Ringwood, who was told to bring to the dining-room the first intimation that the wounded man was living. Mr. Ringwood nodded. \" There, you 3ee, all's right; now he will go to sleep, and as all will depend upon the state in which he awakens, I will, if you please, wait here, unless I should be urgently sent sor from home, for I have left word where I am.\" \"Pardon me, doctor, for finding any fault with you.\" \" Don't mention it ; what I said did sound harsh.\" Sir George went now at once to the room where his daughter Clara had been taken to, for the purpose of informing her of the hopeful state of affairs. He found her just recovered from her swoon, so that recollection had not yet sufficiently re turned to give her all the agony of think ing that the news so heedlessly and so suddenly communicated by the servant might be true in its full intensity. \" My dear, you must not distress your self,\" said Sir George. \" Ringwood was riding over here, it seems, to see you, and his horse, getting restive, has thrown him; Dr. North says, there is nothing particular the matter, and that after a little rest he will recover.\" About two hours elapsed when the ser vant came in with an air of affright. Dr. North sprang to his feet in a mo ment. \" What is it, is he awake?\" \" Not exactly awake, sir, but he is speak ing in his sleep, and it's all about a\u2014 a \u2014 \"A what?\" Clara tried to speak, but she could not \u2014 she burst into tears. \" A vampyre.\" \" Stuff.\" \" Well, sir, he's a having some horrid dream, I can teU yon, sir, and he said, ' Keep off the vampyre; save her, oh, save her from tbe vampyre!'\" \"How singular!\" said Varney, \"what an absurd belief that is ! A vampyre! What on earth could have put such a thing in his head, I wonder?\" \"I will go to him,\" said Dr. North, \" if he should be very much disturbed, perhaps I shall think it preferable to awake him; but I can inform you all that such dreams show that there is much excitement going on in the brain.\" \"Ah!\" said the old nurse, who was at tending her, and who had been in the family many years, \"ah, poor dear, she will be all right now. I was just wishing that she would have a good cry; it does any one a world of good, it does.\" \" What an agitating night and day this has been, to be sure,\" said Sir George. \" First the terror of losing both my boys, then their return with the dead man, who so oddly comes to life again ; then this dreadful accident to Rigwood ; upou my word the incidents of a whole year have been crammed into a few hours.

It is scarcely n rcssary to say, that such an oiler was most gratefully accepted. Clara was profuse in her acknowledg ments of tlie doctor's kindness, and t ey al! passed the evening together in t e large dining room, to which Varney was first introduced. Doctor North rose, and as A oft t._*i] v ry politely to accompany bin1, he made no soit of objection, and they pro ceeded together to the chamber of the bridegroom. During the time that the doctor had been in the socie'y of Vamey, he bad been much pleased with him. for be found that he possessed a vast store of knowledge upon almost any subject that could be touched upon, besides no small amount of skill nnd theoretical information upon medical mattes, so he let him come with him, when pi rhsps ho would have objected to any (nn* else, Varney the vampyre could fascinate wl r n he liked. Not, however, for a long time had so gloomy an evening been passed at thc Grange as that; nobody was in spirits, and afhnugh there was a great deal of conver sation, it somehow assumed always a very son* bre share, let it commence on what subject it might. Hall- past ten o'clock was thc usual hour at which the family retired for the night, nnd it was quite a relief toevery one, when that hour came, and Sir George ordered limits foi the bed chambers. Clara, indeed, being much oppressed, had retired some time before, anrl so had Emma, so that there were noue but gen. tlemen in the dining room at half-past ten. \"I have ordered a bed to be prepared for you (lose to your patient's,\" said Sir George, to Dr. North. \"Oh, thank you, but I shall only lie down in my clothes ; a couch would have done just as well. I am used to sitting up all night upon occasions.\" \" No doubt, but I hope you will not be disturbed, and lhat to-morrow morning we shall have a better account of your patient.'' \" I hope so too; a good calm night's rest may do much.\" \" Y< u speak doubtingly.\" \" Why in these cases it is difficult to know the extent of injury. There is no fracture of tho skull, hut it is es yet impos sible to say what amount of shaking he has had.\" Whep they reached the chamber the yonng man was quiet, bnt in a few minu es be began to toss about his head, and mut ter in his sleep, \u2014 \"Thc vampyre, the dreadful vampyre. Oh, save her! Hei]', help, help !\" \"This won't do,\" said the doctor. He went to the toilette table, and pro curing a large towel he soake 1 it well in cold water, and then wrapped it round ihe head of Ringwood, and so carefully too as not to arouse him. Thc effect was almost instantaneous. The vexed sleeper relapsed into a much easier attitude, the breathing was mote regular, and tbe distressing fan cies tlr-it had tortured his fevered brain were chased away. \" A simple plan,\" said Varney. \"Yes, but a most efficacious one.\" CHAPTER XCH. \" Well, we can but hope for the best.

Again he started. There was a curious sound about the lock of his door, and he listened intently. \" Now, what on earth can that be ?\" All was still, and he nearly dropped asleep. Twice, however, he thought he heard the sound again, but he would not move, and in a few moments more, he was enjoying a sound repose. How long this repose lasted, he had no means of telling, sor he was suddenly awakened by such a cry, that at first he lay overpowered completely by it, and un- able to move. It was a loud shriekingcrv such as might come from any one fo a most dreadlul agony. \"Good Heaven!\" he cried, 'what's that ?\" bers, and then there was an empty room, and next to that again was the bed-room in which was Ringwood, and then Dr. North's.

By eleven o'clock all was stiU in the bouse. Dr. North had begged a book from the library, sor he thought it likely enough that he should not be able to got much re pose, and with that he sat in his room, the only one, as he thought, in all the house who was not in bed. Now, Dr. North was not a fearful man, nor a nervous one, and be soon recovered. Besides, such a cry as that, be knew very well, must have the effect of arousing every body in the house, so he sprang out of his bed, and rushed to the door. It was fast. He continued reading for about an hour, and then, after visiting his patient, and finding him asleep, he thought it would be just as well for him to pull off his boots and his coat, and lie down on the bed to snatch a few hours' sleep. He performed all the operations bnt the final one\u2014 the sleeping \u2014 for scarcely had he lain down, when he heard a soft sliding sort of noise close to the room door, he thought, and he sprang up in a sitting posture to listen to it. \" Who's there ?\" he cried. There was no answer, and jumping off his bed, he took the light which he had not put oof, and opened his door. All was deserted and still in the corridor. \" Imagination, or some accidental noise that I am not familiar with,\" said the doc- tor, as he closed his door again. Down he laid himself, and he was just npon the point of getting to sleep, when he heard a scratching sound as he thought upon the very panel of the door of his room. Up he sprang again, and this time with. out the delay of asking who was there j he opened his door, and looked out into the corridor, holding the light above his head so as to diffuse its rays as much as possible, but he saw no one, and all the other doors were close shut. \"A plague take it,\" he said, \" I may keep myself at this sort of thing all night, if I am foolish enough. It'3 a cat, perhaps, for all I know; however, it may scratch away, I won't move again.\" In vain he tried tbe lock, and hammered at it and pushed. The door was a thick and a heavy one, and it was quite clear he was a prisoner. This was serious, and he cried out\u2014 \" Help\u2014 help ! here, undo the door, un- do the door. Who has locked me in ?\" He heard the scraping of feet, the sound of voices, the ringing of bells, and all the symptoms of a suddenly alarmed house- hold, but nobody paid any attention to him. He dragged on his boots, in order tbat he might be able to keep up a con- stant kicking on the lower part of his door, and he did keep it up with a vengeance. At length he heard voices close to his door, and some one cried \u2014 \" Open the door, sir, open tbe door !\" \"Open it yourself,\" said Dr. North, \"you have fastened it on the outside, I suppose.\" There was some further running about, and then with a crash tho door was forced open with a crowbar, and upon emerging from the apartment, the doctor found as sembled in the corridor the whole family, with the exception of the two girls, aud several servants half- dressed bearing lights. \" What's the matter?\" cried Sir George, \"what's the matter?\" \" Ah,\" said the doctor, \" that's what I want to know.\" \"Yes, why \u2014 why you made all the dis turbance.\" \" I beg your pardon, there was a scream"], [405, "THE FEAST OF BLOOD. 395 came from somewhere, and when I tried to come out to find what it was, my room door was fast.

He flew to the door of Clara's room, it yielded to his touch. \" Clara-Clara !\" he called. Bang\u2014 bang, bang, bang, came now a sound.

She slightly recovered as he lifted her up, and he resigned her at once to the care of some of the female servants, who now made their appearance in the chamber, aU terribly alarmed at the shriek that had awakened them. \" This is strange,\" said Dr. Nortb, \"here is a small puncture upon the throat of your daughter Clara, that almost looks like the marks of a tooth.\" \"A tooth !\" \" Yes, but of course that cannot be.\" \"Hear me, oh, hear me,\" cried Emma, at this moment. \" Horror \u2014 horror !\" \" What would you say \u2014 speak at once, and clear up this mystery if you can. Wbat has happened ?\" \" I heard a noise, and came from my own chamber to this. There was some one benling over the bed. 'Twas I who shrieked.\" ble at the side of the bed, and Clara seemed to be dead, for she was ghastly pale, and there was blood upon her neck. The father staggered to a seat, but Dr. North at once rushed forward, and held the liiiht to the eyes of Clara, at the same tin.e, that he pieced his finger on her wrist to note if there was any pulsation. \" Onlv a fainting fit,\" he said. \"But'the blood\u2014 the\u2014 the blood,\" cried Sir George. \u25a0' You ?\" u Yes\u2014 oh, yes !

Nothing but a dream ; make yourself comfortable, and think no more of it. I dare say you will have a quiet sleep now, after this. Bat you had better let your sister Emma lie with you, as your nerves are a little shattered.\" \" Oh, yes\u2014 yes !\" Emma, who, truth to tell, was very little better than her sister, professed her readi ness to stay, and the doctor giving Sir George a nod, as much as to say, \" Let no more be said about it just now,\" led the way from the room at once. When he reached tho corridor, where Varney and the two sons wero waiting, he said\u2014 . \" We shall none of us after this, I ain certain, feel inclined to sloop ; suppose we po down 6tairs at once and think and talk this matter over together ; there is more in it, perhaps, than meas the eye ; I will follow you in a moment, when I havo just seen that my patient is all right.\" They all proceeded down stairs to the dining-room, and in a few minutes the doctor followed; lights were procured, and they sat down, all looking at the doctor, who had taken the lead in the affair, and who evidently had some very disagreeable, if not very true, ideas upon the subject matter of the evening's disturbance. \" Well, doctor,\" said Sir George, \" we rely upon you to give your opinion upon this business, aad some insight into its meaning.\" _ \" In the first place, then,\" said the doc tor, '\u2022 I don't understand it.\" \" Well, that's coming to the point.\" \" Stop a bit ; it was no dream.\" \" You think not?\" \" Certainly not a dream ; two people don't dream of the same thin-; at the same time; I don't, of course, deny the pas sbility of such a thing, but it is too re markable a coincidence to believe all at once ; but Emma avows that she saw a somebody in ber sister's room.\" \" Ah !\" said Sir George ; \"she did. I had in my confusion forgotten that horri- ble confirmation of Clara's story. She did so, and before Clara was well recovered too, so she could not have put the idea in- to her heal. Good God ! what am I to think? Eor the love of Heaven some of you tell me what are your opinions upon this horrible affair, which looks so roman- tically unreal, and yet so horribly real.\" All except the doctor looked at each other in surprise. \" Well,\" he said, \" I will tell you what the thing suggests ; not what it is, mind me. What has happened ? I too ask ; ob, Clara! What was it?\u2014 what was it? \"Imagination, most likely,\" said the doctor. \" You had better go to your room again, Miss Emma, for you are trembling with cold and apprehension. Perhaps in the morning, all this affair will assume a different shape. At present we are all too much flurried to take proper cognisance of it. There, your sister is rapidly recovering. How do you feel now, Miss Clara?\" \"I\u2014 1\u2014 am mad!\" \" Oh, pho ! pho ! nonsense !\" \" Oh, God help me ! How horrifying ! How more than dreadful! That awful face ! Those hideous teeth !\u2014 I am mad ! \u2014 I am mad !\" '\u2022 Why, my dear child, you will drive me mad,\" cried Sir George, \"if you talk in such a strain. Oh, let me beg of you not.\" \"Don't heed her,\" said Dr. North. \" This will soon pass away. Come, Miss Clara, you must tell me freely, as your medical man, what has happened. Let us hear the full particulars, and then you know well, that if any human means can aid you, you shall be aided.\" This calm mode of discourse had evi dently a great effect upon her, and after tho silence of a few moments, she spoke much more collectedly than before, say ing\u2014 \" Oh, no\u2014 no !

If you refuse us your confidence how cau we act for you in any way?\" This argument seemed to be effective, and to reach her understanding quite, so that after a shudder, and a glance around her of great dread aud dismay, she spoke, saying in a low, faltering voice \u2014 \" Something came; something not quite human, yet having the aspect of a man. Something that flew at me, and fastened its teeth upon my neck.\" \" Teeth ! everybody says ' teeth !' \" ex claimed the father. \"Hush!\" said the doctor, with an ad monitory wave of his hand ; \" keep that a secret from her, whatever you do.

It is always worth while considering these matters in any possible aspect.

Sir George Crofton and his sons looked curious, and thought that the doctor was going to draw upon his memory in the matter to which he alluded, but he took from his pocket a memorandum book, and from it extracted some printed papers. \" The communication was so curious,\" he said, \"that I cut it out of the old"], [408, "VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE. 398 ance of being quite thunder-struck by what had passed, spoke in the most feeling manner, saying \u2014 \" This is truly one of the most affecting circumstances I ever remember.

The poor father, tbe sisterless sister, the astonished, indignant, and agonised brothers, formed a group that was too sad to contemplate. As they gazed upon the wreck of her whom they had all loved so fondly, they could scarcely believe that death had in deed claimed her as his own; they \"Hush \u2014 hush,\" said Dr. North; \"you arc in grief, sir, and know not wbat you say. These were not else the words that would fall from the lips of such a man as you are.\" The bereaved father was silent, and the sons looked at him with countenances in which dismay was most strongly pictured. They seemed as if as yet tboy had not become fully alive to the loss they had sus- tained, or of what bad realiy happened within the once happy domestic circle, of which the fairest portion was now so ruth- lessly dragged from them. \"It is like a dream,\" said Edwin, ad dressing bis brother Charles, iu a whisper. \" It is much more like a dream than anght else in the world.\" \"Thought her more beautiful than death,\" and could not, as they gazed tremblingly upon her stiU form, bring themselves to believe that she had indeed gone from them for ever. Dr. North, however, soon pnt all deubt upon the subject to rest by an announce ment that her spirit had really fled. In vain he tried all the means that his art suggested. That mysterious and mighty something which we call life, which we miss and yet see no loss, which is so great yet so evanescent and impalpable, was gone. \"Come away,\" he said, \"we can da no good here now. Come away, all of you l\" \" Ob, no, no,\" cried Sir George. \" Why should we leave my child?\" \" That,\" said the doctor, as he pointed to the corpse, \"that is not your child.\" The old man shuddered, and with an aspect upon his face, as if ten years of added age had at least passed over him in those few moments, he suffered them to lead him from the room. They all passed down stairs again, leaving Emma in her own chamber along with the female ser. vants, so hastily again called up to remain with her. \" It is\u2014 it is. Ob, tell me that this is not real.\" \" It is too real,\" said the doctor, \"yon must bow with what amount of resignation you can call to your aid to that stroke of destiny which you cannot control ; you should consider that as regards ber who has gone from you, that she is now no object of piiy. Death is an evil to you in your loss, but it is the end of all evil and pain to ber ; and then again, she has but gone a few years, after all, earlier than usual, for how long shall we \u2014 ay, the best and strongest of us\u2014 be behind her?\" This was consolation of the right sort, and was sure to have its effect upon per sons in the habit of conversing cooUy and calmly upon general subjects, so that in a short time the father eveu felt much better, and although tbe sons were quite con vinced of their loss they no longer looked When the dining-room was reached once more, Mr. Smith, who bore all the appear-"], [409, "VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE; OR, THE FEAST OF BLOOD. 399 at each other with such bewildered aspects, but exhibited the rational grief of men. Charles spoke after a time with great energy, saying \u2014 \" It is true that we may call our reason to our aid, and contrive to rid ourselves of our grief in a great measure ; but there is another duty we have to perform, and that is to diligently inquire why and how it was that our sister got this horrible fright, that has had the effect of hurrying her into eternity.\" \" Yes, brother,\" said Edwin, \" you are right ! our sister's memory shall be vindi cated, and woe be to him who has brought this desolation and grief upon us.\" THE APPEARANCE OF THE RESUSCITATED CORPSE. Sir George looked from one of his sons \" Knit up the ravelled sleeve of ere.\" to the other, but said nothing; he appeared \"Now,\" said Dr. North, \" here we are to be prostrated too much by his feelings, four men with cool heads, and active and tbe doctor strongly urging him to re- enough judgments. For God's sake, let us lire to rest, he shortly did so, where we will try to come to some sort of conclusion leave him ' for a time, hoping that he will about this dreadful affair. What do you find the oblivion of sleep creep over him, say, Charles?\" aQ(j \"In the first place, I should recommend Ne. 01."], [410, "VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE; OR, 402 Varney thought that as the father uttered these last words, he glanced in a peculiar manner at him, but he was not quite sure that such was the case. Had he been sure, perhaps, he would have taken other steps than he did. Little more passed during the breakfast, but when that meal was over, Sir George said \u2014 that the house be searched diligently, in order that we may see if any stranger is in it, or discover any means by which an entrance to the premises has been effected. We don't know but that after all some robbery may be the aim, and that the fright of our sister, which has had so fatal an effect, may be the consequence merely of the appearance of a thief in her room.\" \"Agreed,\" said Edwin, \" let the search of the house be our first step.\" Two of the new servants were summoned with lights, and the party of four proceeded to an examination of the house, which on account of its size was not a very short process, for there were so many staircases and rooms opening the one into the other, that the hiding places were numerous enough. At length, however, they were not only satisfied that no one was concealed on the premises, but likewise that all the fasten ings were quite secure, and had been made so before the servants retired to rest. The mystery, therefore, was rather increased. Had there not been the collateral evi dence of Emma, and the singular fact of the fasteaingup ofthe doors of the doctor's and Mr. Smith's bed-chambers, no doubt the whole affair would have rested where it was, and have been pnt down as a remark able death arising from the influence of a dream. \" Edwin, we are but dull and poor com pany to Mr. Smith ; it will amuse him per haps, if you take him through the grounds, and show him the estate.\" Edwin made no objection, and as the thing was put in the shape of au amusement to him, Varney could only say same civil things, and lisa to go. \" 1 regret,\" he said, \" to be of so much trouble.\" \" Not at all,\" said Edwin, \" no trouble, sir; my own mind, God knows, wants something to distract it from too close a contemplation of its own thoughts. If you will accompany me in a walk over the estate, it wiU, perhaps, put me into better spirits.\" They left the room, and when they were gone, Sir George Crofton rose and shut tbe door, fastening it on the inside care fully, rather to the surprise of the doctor and bis son Charles, who looked at him ia silence. \"Charles,\" he then said, \"aud yon, doctor, 1 bave something particular to say to y ou.\" \" What is it? What is it?\" they both said in a breath. \" God forgive me if I am wrong, but I suspect our guest.\" \"Mr. Smith?\" \" Yes, I don't like his looks at all ; now we know nothing of him but from his own report ; we have searched the house right through, or at least you have, you tell me, and found nothing. Ha is the only stranger within our doors. Perhaps it is uncharitable to suspect him, but I cannot help it, the thought came too strongly upon me last night, as I was alone in my chamber, sor me to overcome it. I have now spoken to you both frankly, and tell me what are your thoughts.\" \"I don't like him,\" said Charles. \" He is a very singular man,\" said Dr. North. But that was out of the queston \u2014 some body had been seen, and whether that somebody was really not an inhabitant of this world was the question. In the midst of all this, the day began to dawn. Sir George had had no sleep, but he had done himself some good in the solitude of his own chamber. He had prayed long and earnestly, and his prayers had had the effect which they almost invariably have upon all imaginative persons, namely, of bringing him an amount of mental calm ness, peace, and resignation, highly desira ble in his circumstances. The breakfast table was laid in silence by the servants, and when Sir George met his sons and his guests, he spoke calmly enough, saying to them \u2014 \"You will no more bear from me the accent of grief or of despair. I accept what consolation I can find, but as a mau and a father I will have justice ; my child has been terrified to death, and I will find who has done the deed, for let him be whom he may, he is as much her murderer as though he had plunged a dagger in her heart.\" \"What \u2014 what now if he were\u2014 were \" \"Why do you hesitate, father?

THE NIGHT WATCH. \u2014 THE SUBPBISE.\u2014 \" Good God ! yon pnt a frightful idea into my brain that wUl now never leave it. A vampyre?\" \" Heaven forbid,\" added Sir George, \" tbat I should say such a thing heedlessly, or that I should take upon myself to assert that such is the case ; I merely throw it out as a supposition \u2014 a horrible one, I grant, but yet one that perhaps deserves some consideration.\" THE CHASE, TlRVIHISO was now said and done that could induce a feeling in the mind of Varney, that he was per fectly wel come at the \" Get rid of him,\" said Dr. North. \" It is difficult after telling him he was welcome to stay, to now tell him that we want him to go.

The day to all parties seemed a fright fully long one. Ringwood remained in the same state of unconsciousness as he had been in the day previous, and the only cir cumstance that served to break the mono tony of the time, was the arrival of some of his friends to see him. keep the closest watch.\" \" And that, too, without her knowing it,\" said the doctor. \"If she is awaveot any thing of the sort, there is no knowing what tricks her imagination might play her ; and now, Sir George, I must say that I take the greatest interest in the matter, and will, with your permission, remain here until I am sent for. Poor Ringwood still remains insensible, and I take it that under the circumstances it is really a mercy, for what a sad communication has to be made to him, when he does recover sufficiently to hear it.\" It is not essential to our story that we should take up space in detailing what they said and what they did; suffice it that all the grief was exhibited that was to be expected, and that finally they left the Grange with a conviction that the wounded man was in as kind hands as they could possibly wish him, and everything would be done, that kindness and skill could suggest, to recover him and preserve his life. Probably the dreadful catastrophe that had happened in the family of the Crof tons had its effect in reconciling the Ringwoods to the lesser calamity, for Dr. North gave them strong hopes of his ulti mate recovery. \"Sad, indeed.\" It was now finally agreed among them that there was to be no variation whatever in their conduct towards Mr. Smith ; but that after they had taken leave of him for the night, and had all gone to bed, they should each glide out of his chamber, and wait at the extreme end of the corridor in silence, to mark if anything should happen. This was duly announced to Edwin, who with a shudder announced that he had his suspicions, too, of Mr. Smith, so he, of course, came into the scheme at once ; and now they waited rather anxiously for the night to come again. And so the time passed on, until the shadows of the evening began to creep over the landscape, and thc distant trees imperceptibly mingled together in a chaotic mass. The song of the birds was over\u2014 the herds and flocks had sought their shelter for the night\u2014 and a solemn and beautiful stillness was upon the face of nature. Assembled once more in the dining-room of the Grange, were the Croftons\u2014 but not Emma, sho was in her chamber\u2014 the doc tor, and Mr. Smith. Varney had exerted himself much to be eutertaining, and yet not obtrusively so, as"], [412, "VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE; OR, 402 under tho calamitous and extraordinary circumstance in which the family was placed, that would have been bad taste; but he led the conversation into the most interesting channels, and he charmed those who listened to him, in spite of them selves. Charles, joined the doctor, who merely nodded to them, as they could faintly see him. Sir George spoke in a very faint whis per, saying, \u2014 \" We are well armed.\" \" Good, \"replied the doctor, inasimilar cautious tone, \" but let mo implore of you to be careful how you use your arms. Do nothing hastily, I beg of you; you don't know what cause of regret tho imprudence of a moment may give rise to.\" \"Depend upon us, we will be very care ful indeed.\" Dr. North was peculiarly pleased with so scientific a companion, and one who had travelled so much, sor Varney spoke of almost every portion of the globe as familiar to him. In this kind of way, the evening sped on, and more than once as Varney was giving some eloquent and comprehensive description of some natural phenomenon that he had witnessed in some other clime, not only were the suspicions entertained against him forgotten, but even the grief ofthe family faded away for a brief space before the charm of his discourse. \" That is right.\" \" We had better not talk,\" said Charle?, \" these corridors carry sound sometimes too well ; if we are to do any good, it must be by preserving the profoundest silence.\" This advice was too practical and evi dently good to be neglected, and conse quently they were all as still as they could be, and stood like so many statues sor the next half-hour. At length the time for rest came. Sir George rose, and bowing to Varney, said, \u2014 \" Do not let our example influence you, sir. We retire now.\" They heard a clock that hung in the hall below strike tho hour of twelve, and when the reverberations of the sound were over, a stillness even more profound than before seemed to pervade the whole house. The half-hour they had waited in such silenee appeared to them to be of four times the usual length, and they were glad to hear twelve strike. \" I shall be glad to do so,\" said Varney, \"likewise; last night was a disturbed as well as a melancholy one sor all in this house.\" \" It was, indeed.\" In another five minutes the dining-room was vacant, and ail that conld be heard in tho house was the noise of putting up extra bars, and shooting into their places long unused bolts, in order that it should be quite beyond all doubt that no oue could get into the premises. After that, all was still. The moon was in her last quarter now, but only at tbe commencement of it, so if the night proved not to be so cloudy, it would be rather a brilliant one, which might, or might not be of service to those who were going to watch in the corridor the proceedings of Mr. Smith. An hour elapsed before thero was any movement whatever, and then it was Dr. North who first, with great care, emerged from the room. He had drawn on his stockings over his shoes, so that his footsteps might not be heard, and he took his station in a dark corner by the large window we have before spoken of as lighting the corridor. The moon was up, but it only shone in obliquely at the window, so that one side of the corridor was enveloped in the deep est gloom, while on the other the pale rays A few minutes more, for half-past eleven was the hour on which they had all agreed, aud Sir George, with Edwin and Still they said nothing, for if silence before twelve o'clock was a thing to be desired, it was much more so after that hour, for it was then that the alarm of the preceding evenfog had taken place. Their i | watchfulness and their anxiety momen tarily increased. The old clock in the hall chimed the quarter past twelve, and yet all was as still as the grave ; not the smallest sound dis turbed the repose ofthe house. The moon had shifted round a little, so that the gloom of the corridor was not so complete as it had been, and Dr. North was aware that in another heur the spot where they all stood would be visited by some rays which would render their con cealment out of the question. Bat as yet all was right, and there was no need to shift their position in the least. Suddenly Sir George Crofton laid his hand upon the arm of the doctor, and an exclamation involuntarily escaped him, but not iu a loud tone. \" Hush, for God's sake,\" whispered the doctor. They had all heard a slight noise like the cautious opening of a door. They looked eagerly in tbe direction from whence"], [413, "THE FEAST OF BLOOD. 403 it came, and to their surprise they found it proceed from the chamber of the dead ! Yes, the door of the room in which lay the corpse of Clara slowly opened. \" God of Heaven,\" said Sir George. \"Hush \u2014 hush,\" again whispered the doctor, and he held him by the arm con vulsively. All was stilL The door creaked upon its hinges a little, that was all. A quarter of an hour passed, and then Sir George was about to say something, when he started as if a shock of electricity had been appUed to him, for the door of Varney's room was swung wide open, and he appeared, full dressed. All the doors opening from the corridor creaked unless they were flung open smartly and quickly, and there could be no doubt but that Varney knew this, and hence the apparent precipitancy of his appearance. orders to arouse some of the men servants, besides getting some weapon or tool by the assistance of which the door might be forced, and he soon returned with several of the men, and one armed with the iden tical crow-bar that had been used with such effect on the preceding evening. They brought Ughts with them, too, so that the capture of Mr. Smith appeared to be no longer a matter of doubt with such a force opposed to him. \" Now,\" cried Sir George, \" do net mind what mischief you do, my men, so that you break open the door of that room, and quickly, too.\" People somehow are always glad to be engaged in anything that has a destruc tive look about it, and when the servants heard that they might break away at the door as much as they liked, they set about it with a vengeance that promised soon to succeed in the object. The door yielded with a crash. \" Come on, come on. Yield yourself,\" cried Sir George, and he rushed into the room, followed by his sons, and by Dr. North. There he stood in the moonlight, close by the threshold of his room, gazing about him. He bent himself into an attitude of intense listening, and remained in it for sometime, and then he with slow gliding steps made his way towards the door of Emma's room. There was no Mr. Smith there. \" Escaped,\" said Dr. North. \" Impossible, \u2014 impossible ! and yet this open window. He mu.-t be lying dashed to pieces below, for no one couid with safety drop or jump such a height. Run round to the garden some of yon, at once.\" His hand was actually upon the lock, when Sir George, who could stand the scene no longer, levelled a pistol he had taken from his pocket, and without giving any intimation to those who were with him of what he was going to do, he pulled the trigger. The pistol only flashed without being fully discharged. \"How imprudent,\" said the doctor. \" You have done it now ! Follow me !\" He rushed forward, but he was too late. Varney had taken the alarm, and in a moment had regained his own room and fastened it securely on the inside. \"We must have him,\" cried Charles. \" He cannot escape from that room. There is no other door, and the window is a good thirty feet from the garden below. Alarm the servants, we will soon open his door. It can't be very secure, for the lock was broken last night.\" As he spoke, Charles made a vigorons effort to open the door, but it resisted as if it had been a part of the solid wall, while within the chamber all was perfectly still, as if Mr. Smith had quite satisfied himself by shutting out bis assailants, and meant to take no further notice of them. \" Stop,\" said Charles. \" There is no oc casion. He has had ample time to escape. Look here.\" Charles pointed out the end of a thick rope, firmly fastenel to the ledge of the window, and by which it was quite clear any one could safely descend into the gar den, it only requiring a Uttle nerve to do so with perfect ease. \" This has all been prepared,\" said Dr. North. \" Still,\" cried Sir George, \" I will not give the affair up. Mind, I offer a reward of twenty guineas to any one of my house hold who succeeds in catching Mr. Smith.\" \"Lor, sit! what has he done?\" said a groom. \" Never you mind what he has done. Bring him in, and you shall have the re ward.\" \" Very good, sir. Come on, Dick, and you, Harry; let's all go, aud you know it will be all the pleasanter to share the reward among us. Come on.\" Thus stimulated by their companion, the servants ran out of the house into the moonlit park iu search of Varney the Vampyre. \" This is strange,\" said the doctor, \"but we shall soon find out what he means by it. The door must be forced as quickly as possible.\" Edwin ran down stairs by his father's"], [414, "VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE; OR, 404 any one to see unmoved, for both Charles and Edwin stood like statues gazing at it, and for a time incapable of motion. \"My sister\u2014 is it indeed my sister?\" said Charles. The doctor fairly closed the door upon them all, aud turned them so out of tbs room. Then he, having professionally lost all dread ofthe dead, lifted the body upon the bed again, and disposed it properly, after which, without saying a word, he walked down to tha dining-room. \"Tell me, tell me,\" 6aid Sir George, \"what does all this mean?\" \"Do not ask me,\" replied Dr. North, \"I cannot tell you; I confess I do not know what advice to give you, or indeed what to say to you.\" The old man rested his head upon his hands, and wept bitterly, while his two sons sat looking at each other perfectly aghast, and unable to think anything of a rational import concerning the most mys terious proceedings tbat had taken place. CHAPTER XCVI. THE TUNEBAL. \u2014 A STRANGE INCIDENT. It was all very I well for Sir ' George Crofton to offer his twenty guineas for the taking of Mr. Smith, and nothing could be more legitimate than his servants making active exertions to en- deavour to earn that amount of money, but the really suc ceeding in doing so was quite another thing. To be sure, they went out into the park, and did the best to catch him, and being well acquainted with every turn and every pathway within it, they considered they had a fair chance of succeeding, but after their pains they were at length obliged to give up the affair as a bad job, after an hour or two's most active search. Let our readers then suppose that a week has passed away, aud that tho morning has arrived when the body of Clara is to be placed in a vault appropriated as the resting place of the Croftons, beneath the church that was close at hand. While they were away, though, there was a something that occurred at the Grange which gave a great additional shock to Sir George and his sons. It will not fail to be remembered that the first door they saw move while they were keeping watch and ward in the moon lit gallery was the door of the chamber in which lay the corpse of Clara, who had met with so melancholy an end. This circumstance recurred to them all with fearful force when they felt convinced that the now more than suspected Mr. Smith had really and truly made his escape. During that time, nothing whatever had been heard of Mr. Smith. He seemed to have completely disappeared from the neighbourhood, as well as from the Grange house. Fortunately, although Sir George had offered twenty guineas lor the apprehension of Mr. Smith to his servants, he had said nothing of the cause why he offered sueh a reward, and the neighbourhood was left to its own conjectures upon the subject. '.these conjectures were of course suffi ciently numerous, but it was quite agreed between Sir George, Dr. North, and the two sons, that nothing more should be said upon the subject. They, of course, did not wi.h Upon proceeding to that room of the dead, Dr. North being first, they found some difficulty in opening the door, but upon using force they succeeded, when to their absolute horror they saw that the dead body was lying upon the floor close to the door, and that it had been the ob struction to moving it. Dr. North would fain have spared the feelings of Sir George this affecting sight, but the baronet was so close behind him that he could not do so. '* To sill the ear of idle curiosity1* with such a tale as they might tell, but had a thousand reasons, each good and sub stantial of its kind, for withholding it. Young Ringwood was sufficiently re covered to be about, and to have told him the story that widowed his heart. He fell into a profound melancholy which nothing could alleviate, and as his ree. -very went on, he asked permission to remain at the Grange. Sir George, and indeed all thc Crofton family, gladly pressed him to remain with them as long as he would do so, sor it was \" Oh, God !\" cried the father, \" my child, my child.\" \"Take your father away, boys, for heaven's sake,\" said Dr. North to the two young men; \"this is no 6ight sor him to see.\" It appeared, too, as if it were no sight for j"], [415, "THE FEAST OP BLOOD. 407 some alleviation of their own distress to have him about them. He begged permission to be present at the funeral, and it is of that funeral we have now to speak, for it took place on that day week on which the vampyre had first taken up his dreadful residence at the old Grange-house, where all before had been so happy. The church, as we have remarked, was not very far distant, and a mournful pro cession it was, consisting of tho funeral equipages, followed by Sir George Crof ton's carriage, that at twelve o'clock in the day started to place the youngest and the fairest of the name of Crofton that had ever reposed in the family vault. The whole neighbourhood was in a state of commotion, and by the time the funeral cortege reached the churchyard, there was not a person capable of being out, for some miles around, that was not congregated about the spot. The old church bell tolled a melancholy welcome to the procession, and the clergy man met the corpse at the entrance of the graveyard, and preceded it to the church, where it was placed by the altar while he made an impressive prayer. This brief ceremony over, the coffin was carried to the part of one of the aisles where, upon the removal of a large stone slab, the resting-place of the Croftons was visible. \" I have not looked upon these stone steps,\" said Sir George, \" since my poor wile went down there in the sleep of death.\" \" Compose yourself,\" whispered Dr. North, who was present. \"You ought not, sir, to have been present at such a scene as this.\" \" Nay, it surely was my duty to follow my own child to her last resting-place.\" The body was lowered into the vault, and the funeral service was read impres sively over the cold and still remains of Clara. \"All is over,\" said the doctor. \"Yes,\" faltered Sir George; \"all is over. Farewell, my dear child, but not a long farewell to thee ; this blow has nearly stricken me into tho grave.\" Leaning on the arm of his son Charles, who as well as Edwin was deeply affected, the old man now allowed himself to be led from the church. He met at the door Will Stephens, the sexton, who seemed desirous of speaking to him. \" What is it, Will ?\" he inquired of the sexton. \" WiU your honour have some fresh 6awdust put down in the vault ? It wants it, Sir George ; there aint been any put in for many a long day.\" \" Very well. It will be ready for me when I go. It won't be long before the vault is again opened.\" \" Oh, do not say that, father,\" said Ed win. \" Do not leave us ; think that if you have lost one child who loved you, you have others who ought to be as dear to you.\" \" That's right, Edwin,\" said the doctor. Sir George made no distinct reply to this, but he pressed the band of his eon, and looked kindly upon him, to signify that he felt the full justice of what he had just said, so they had hopes that time would soon produce its usual effects upon that feeling which of all others is, while it lasts, the most poignant, at the same time that it is the most evanescent\u2014 grief for the dead. And well it is that it should be so, other wise we should be a world of weepers and mourners, for who is there that has not felt the pang of losing some fond heart in which we have garnered up the best affec tions of hnman nature? Emma since her sister's death had been terribly broken down in spirit, and when they all got home to the Grange, they found her looking so ill, that the old baro net took Dr. North on one side, and said to him in tones expressive of the deepest anguish\u2014 . \" Am I to lose both my girls ? \" Ob, no\u2014 no ! certainly not,\" was the decided reply. \" Why, my old friend, you used to be a man of great moral courage. Where has it all gone to now ?\" \" It is in the grave of my child.\" \"Come\u2014 come, you must for your own sake, as well as for the sake of others, who are near and dear to you, rouse yourself from this state of mental torpor, as I may call it. You can do so, and it is worthy of yon to make the effort. Only think what would have been your situation if you had had but one child, and that had been snatched away from you ; but you have yet three to comfort you, and yet you talk despairingly, as if every tie that bound you to the world had been suddenly burst asunder.\" \u201e \u201e . After this Sir George Crofton was al most ashamed to make such an exhibition of his grief, and whatever his thoughts were he kept them to himself, as well as exer cising amuch greater control over his voice, and the external expression of the teel inas, which were still busy at his heart. The despondency of Eingwood was great. He conld not help fancying that it he had not met with the unlucky accident"], [416, "VARN'EY, THE VAMPYRE. 406 I in the ravine, Clara would have been saved, and in some obscure way to his mind, the circumstances seemed to be connected to- gether. He could not account either for , the loss of her miniature, which he had been | in the habit of wearing, but which he missed upon his convalescence, so that he was irresistibly led to the conclusion that some unfriendly hands had been about him during his insensibility. So highly did he prize the miniature, that he offered a sum of money, exceeding its intrinsic value by twenty times, sor its recovery, and pledged himself to make no inquiry as to how it came into the posses sion of the party who should restore it to him ; but for all that it was not forth coming. CHAPTER XCVII. THE SI BANGS VISITOR TO THE OLD CHCRM AT NIGHT. \" he request of Will Stephens to be allowed to put some sawdust in the vault of the Croftons, was one of those regular things that he al- ways pro- pounded to any one who had a vault The reader of this narrative knows very well in whose possession it was. Varney j the Vampyre had possessed himself of it in the ravine, when he saw the young j bridegroom lying insensible at his feet, and he kept it, although why he did so does not as yet appear, for surely the sight of it could only remind him of one of his victims; but then Varney had other thoughts and feelings than he used to have. Alas ! what a thousand pities it was that the ocean had presented to him the two brothers ! Why did he not sink \u2014 why did not some wave hide him from their observa- tion? What misery would have been spared j to them, and to all dear to them. And what misery would have been 6pared to j the wretched Varney himself I Jt is true that he has given expressions r to sentiments, and declared intentions : which would go far to prove that he had ; for ever given up and got rid of all human feelings and influences, but has he really i so got rid of such feelings? It is a ques- ' tion which time alone can answer. i We shall soon see in his now very short i career whether he is most to suffer or to \u25a0 ioflict suffering, and what will be the re- I suit of his new principles of action\u2014 those i principles which he had in the despair and t the agony of his heart painted to himself 1 as the main springs of a combined existence, < he had with such vain and such fruitless 1 perseverance strove to rid himself of. It t was sad\u2014 very sad, indeed, that such a being could not die when he chose, the t poor privilege of all. t i I (! t [opened beneath the old church, and he generally made a very good thing of it. j People were always too much taken up with thinking of the loss of the relation who had just been placed in that dismal repository, to think much of a guinea to Will for a shilling's worth of sawdust, and if they did ever intimate that they thought it rather too much, he always had his answer ready at the tip of his tongue. \" How should you like, sir, or madam, as the caso may be, to go into a vault among the dead, to lay the sawdust for 'cm ?\" That argument was generally conclusive, and Will would get his guinea. With Sir George Crofton he was qnite sure and safe, so he had no scruples upon the subject, and the little bit of sawdust he meant to carry in when be had time, was more for the say of the thing, than for any utility it was at all likely to be of, hut then as he said \u2014 \"Where's the odds? the dead 'uns can't see it, and living 'uns won't go to see it, so it does very well, and I pockets my guinea, which does better still, for after all a sex ton's ain't the most agreeable life in tho world, and he ought to be paid well; not that I care much about it, being used to it, but there was a time when I had my qualms, and I've had to get over 'em the best way I could, somehow, if 1 am now all right.\" These were Will's arguments and reflec tions to himself before night, when he meant to go and place the little bag of sawdust in the Croftons' family vault. But, before we follow Will Stephens or. bis sawdust expedition, as we intend to do we wish first to draw the attention of the reader to another circumstance, the re lation of which to Will Stephens' proceed ings will very shortly appear, indeed."], [417, "VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE; OR THE FEAST OF BLOOD 409 .. As the night came on there was some appearance of stormy weather. The wind blew in a strange, gusty and uncertain manner, shifting about from point to point of the compass in an odd way, as though it bad not made up its mind from whence to blow. The most weather-wise person- ages of the neighbourhood were puzzled, for just a3 they prognosticated one species of weather from the particular direction whence the wind came, it shifted and came from some other quarter very nearly directly opposite. This was extremely provoking, but at LADY'S CHAMBER. THE F1IOHT OP THE VAMPVRE FROM THB TOONO all events it was generally agreed that the moon would not on that night shed its soft Ught npon the earth. How far they were mistaken in this sur mise we 3hall presently see. Will Stephens had an opinion, from certain admonitory symptoms arising from his corns, that it would rain; so he delayed going to the church until he should see what sort of weather it was going to be, inwardly deciding that it would be a capi tal excuse not to go at all that night if the rain should come down pretty sharply. This period of indecision he passed at a pubUc-honse, known as the Blue Lion the charms of the excellent ale of that, es- No. 522"], [418, "VARNEY, THE VAMPYKE; OR, 408 to the window imme liately above him, and ben he had a firm hold. tablishment materially assisting him in coming to the conclusion that if it should rain ever so little it would be better to put off his job until the morning. Now it was not that Will was afraid that he hesitated. He was too used to death to feel now any terrors of fear. It was nothing but the ale. Why, then, was the hurry ? Simply that the flat stono which was over the vault of the Croftons was left unfastened until the aforesaid saw- dust was placed within the receptacle of the dead, and the next day was Sunday, so that the job must he finished before the service should commence. At night, therefore or very early the following morning, Will must seem to earn his guinea by going to the vault. He did not like to venture saying he had been and yet neglect going, for he knew there were too many gossips about the village to make that safe. After that his progress was easy, assum ing that his object was merely to get up to the window of tho old church, for he stood upon tho narrow ledge without in a few moments. There was a slight noise, it was of the breaking of a pane of glass, and then the stranger introduced his haud into the church, and succeeded in removing a rude primitive-looking fastening which held the window in its place. In another moment he disappeared from external observation within the sacred building. What could he want there at such an hour, and what was he ? Did he contem plate disturbing the repose of the dead with some unhallowed purpose? Was robbery his aim ? Let us be patient, and probably we shall soon encugh perceive that some affairs are in progress that require theclosest attention, and which in their results are calculated to fill the reflecting mind with the most painful images, and awaken sensations of horror at the idea that such things can really be, and are permitted tacitly by Heaven to take place on the beautiful eartii destined for tbe dwelling-place of man. While ho is, howecer, regaling himself at the ale house, another person, totally, to all appearance, heedless of wind and threatening rain, is abroad in the neigh bourhood of the church. A tall figure, enveloped in a large murky looking cloak, is moving slowly past the few cottages in the immediate vicinage of the church, and so noiselessly that it looks like a spirit of the dead rather than a living person. It was unseen by any one, for it was a time of the night \u2014 half-past eleven\u2014 now at which few persons in that little quiet place were abroad, and as we have said, Will Stephens, perhaps tbe only inhabitant who had any real business to be abroad at such an hour, was still solacing himself at the Blue Lion with the ale that seemed to get better every glass he took. CHAPTER XCVIII. WILL STEPHENS' VISIT TO THE FAMILY VAULT WITH THE SAWDUST, AND WHAT HE SAW THERE. \u25a0ill Stephens ! waited at the | a 1 e-house I much longer 1 than he inten ' ded. To be j sure the rain ! cleared off, bnt I what of that ? j It was not j a circumstance I that made the The figure moved on at aslow and steady pace among the old tomb-stones that lay so thick around in the circuit of the church yard, until it reached the church itself, and then it walked slowly around the sacred edifice, looking with a curious eye at the windows that presented themselves to ob servation, and apparently scanning their height from the ground. Finally he paused at a rugged-looking part of the wall, and commenced, with great muscular power and most wonderful agility, climbing up to one of the said windows. - \u25a0' \"t*L_____eSB ale anything the worse, and so he waited to drink it wfth a gusto that improved each glass amazingly, and then some of those who were present\u2014 jolly topers Uke himself\u2014 began to laugh and to say\u2014 \" Ah, Will, you may as well poke that bag of sawdust into some corner ; you won't do anything with it to-night, old fel low, we know.\" Now, some people get good tempered To look at that wall it would have seemed that nothing human could possibly have succeeded in ascending it, and yet this stranger, catching at asperities which scarcely seemed to be such, did, with a wonderful power and strength, drag him eelf up until he grasped an iron bar, close"], [419, "THE FEAST OP BL>OD. 409 and complying when they have had the drop too much, and others again get par ticularly obstinate and contradictory. Will of the two certainly had more pretensions to belong to the latter class than tbe for mer, so when ho heard sucb a prophecy concerning his movements and knew it was all an assumption based upon the ale he had drunk, he felt indignant. \"Not go !\" he cried. \" Not go ! You may fancy if you please that I will not go, but you will find yourselves mistaken: I will go.\" \" What, so late !\" \" What's the odds to me ? Any of yon now would be frightened out of your lives to set foot in the old church at such a time as this, I know ; but I'm none of the timid sort; I'm afraid of nobody living, and it ain't likely that I'm now going to be afraid of anybody dead.\" \" Then you reaUy will go ?\" The only reply that he made to this was to finish off the glass of ale that was before him, shoulder the bag of sawdust, and sally out into the open air. Will Stephens felt highly indignant and touchy about his honour, and as he had said he would go and then somebody chose to imply a doubt still, he was grievously offended. When he got out, he found that the night was anything but an inviting one. He wa3 still sober enough to see that, and to feel that although the heavy rain had ceased, there was a little disagreeable misty sort of vapour in the air. He staggered at the first turning he came to, for rather an uncomfortable gust of wind blew in his face, carrying along with it such a shower of small cold rain that he was, or fancied himself to be, wet through in a moment. \" Ah !\" he said, \" here I am at last at any rate. I do hate this sort of rain, you can hardly make up your mind that it is raining at all, and yet, somehow you get soaked before you know where you are. It's just like going through a damp cloud, that it is, and yet, somehow or another, I don't much mind it ; I'm earning a guinea easy enough. Ha \u2014 ha !\" This was by no means an unpleasant reflection. \"Yes,\" he added, \"I am earning a guinea easily enough, that's quite clear, but then it's not everybody who would, sor a guinea, go into anybody's family vault at sucb a time. By-the-by, I wonder now what the time is exactly ?\" Scarcely had Will spoken those words when the old church-clock struck the hour oftwelve. It was a very serious, deliberate sort of clock that, and it took a long time to strike twelve, and Will listened with the greatest attention with the hope of persuading him self that it was only eleven, but there could be no mistake, twelve it was. \" Really,\" he said, \" is it so late? Well, I didn't think \" Will stood within the porch ofthe church door, and he gave a sort of shiver, and then, with the bag ot sawdust in his hand, he stopped to listen attentively, for he thought he heard a slight sound. \" What was that, eh? what\u2014 I thonght, nay, I am sure I heard something; it's very odd \u2014 very odd, indeed.\" As if then to afford Will an excuse for resolving the sound to be something else, the wind at this moment came in such a sudden gale round the ancient edifice, that he quite congratulated himself he was within the porch and protected from its fury; and, besides, it to his mind was a sufficing explanation of the noise he had heard. \" Some of the old doors,\" he muttered, \" rattled by the wind, that's all. Now I suppose we shall have a clear night after all the rain. Such a gale will sewn blow off the damp clouds.\" Will was right. The gale, for a gale it was, blew from the north, and away went the rain clouds as if a curtain had been drawn aside by some invisible hand. After some rummaging Will found in his pocket the key of the church ; it was not the key of the principal door, but of a smaller side entrance, at which the officials who required at all times free ingress and egress made application. The little arched door creaked upon its hinges, and then Will stood in a sort of vestibule, for another door that was never fast had to be opened \"Pleasant this,\" thought Will ; \" but I will not go back to be laughed at.\" As for the sawdust he was carrying, its weight was by no means any great con sideration, sor it was just as light as it could be. \" No, I won't go back\u2014 back, indeed, not I ; they would make me stand a pot of ale to a certainty if I were to go back ; and, besides, it would be all over the parish to-morrow that Will Stephens, after he got half way to the church, was afraid to go any further. Confound the smaU rain, it pricks like pins and needles.\" Nothing is more sobering than rain, and as he, WB, gradually got saturated with the small aqu\u00e6ous particles, the effect of the strong ale as gradually wore off, until by the time the dim, dusky outline of the church rose before him he was almost as sober as need be."], [420, "VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE; OR, 410 before he could be fairly said to be within the church. He rose to his feet again, heartily ashamed of his own fears. Luckily his lantern had not been broken nor extinguished, in his fall, and now, without another word, he prepared himself to execute the work ho came to do, and leave the church to its repose as quickly as possible. At one end of the church, the southern end, there was a large window, which might be said to light the whole of thc interior, for tbe little windows at the sides were more ornamental than useful, being nothing but lattices ; and across this window was drawn a heavy cloth curtain, so that when the sun shone too brightly upon the con gregation on a summer's day, it could be wholly or partially excluded upon a 6ign from the clergyman. The curtain was drawn close on the window now, at night, and Will just glanced up to it, as he walked on towards the aisle where the opening to the family vault of the Croftons was situated. \" All's right,\" he said, \" what a fool I have been to be 6ure. Upon my word, I Might have continued frightenin g myself aU night, and some people would too, but that's not my way of doing business. So here we are, all right. Tbe door is on one side, so that I have just room enough to go down in the vault. Oh ! when one comes to think of it, it was rather a melan choly thing, the death of such a young girl as she was, going to be married, too. Well, that's the way the world goes.\" The stone 6teps leading down to the vault were rather steep, and Will threw down the bag of sawdust first, in pre ference to carrying it, and then, with his lantern in his hand, he commenced his own descent. This second door was covered wiih green baize, and could be opened and shut very noiselessly indeed. Will Stephens stood in the vestibule until be had got a small lantern out of one pocket, and some matches from another. Then in a few moments he had a light, ond once again shouldering the bag of saw dust, he pushed open the inner door, and stood in tho church. It might have been fancy\u2014 nay, he felt certain, it could be nothing else \u2014 but he thought as he opened the door that a faint sort of sigh came upon bis ears. Fancy or not, though, it was an ancom sortable thing at such at hour, and in such a place, too, and he had never before heard anything of the sort upon his visits to the church, and he had visited it at all hours, many and many a time. \"It's odd,\" he said, \"it's uncommonly odd. I never felt so uncomfortable in the church before. I \u2014 I never used to mind coming to it in the middle of the night. Bnt now,I \u2014 eh?\u2014 what was that?\" Again an odd sort of noise came upon his ears, and he dropped the bag of saw dust. All was still again, save tho regular roar of wind, as it swept round the sacred build ing, and although Will Stephens stood for nearly ten minutes in an attitude of listen ing, he heard nothing to augment his ter rors. But let an impulse once be given to fear, and it will go on accumulating mate rial from every trivial circumstance. The courage of the sexton was broken down, and there was no knowing, now, what tricks his awakened imagination might play him. He began to wish he had not come, and from that wisb, to think that he might as well go back, only shame forbade him, for it would be easily known on the morrow that be had not placed tbe sawdust in the vault, and, lastly, he began to think that someone might be playing him a trick. This last supposition, probably, had more effect in raising his courage than any pre ceding one. Indignation took possession of him, and he no longer thought of re treating. He went forward at once, and fell over the bag of sawdust. \" Murder !\" shouted Will. \" That'll do,\" said Will, when he felt his feet upon the soft old sawdust that was on the floor of the vault. \" That'll do\u2014 now for it, I shall soon have this job set tled, and then I'll get home no faster than I can.\" Somehow or another, he felt very much inclined to talk ; the sound of his own voice, conversing, as he might be said to be, with himself, gave him a sort of cou rage, and made the place not appear to be altogether so desperately lonely as it reaUy was. That, no doubt, was the feeling that brought forth so many indifferent remarks from Will Stephens. He held np his light to look round him, and turned graduaUy upon his heels as he did so. The light shook in his hand. The hair almost stood on end on his head \u2014 his leeth chattered, and he tried to speak in vain, as he saw lying at his feet, a cuffiu lid. The moment he did so, he recollected what it was that had occasioned his fall, and being ashamed of himself he called out impulsively, as if somebody was there to hear him \u2014 \" No \u2014 no, it's only the sawdust. No \u2014 no.\""], [421, "THE FEAST OE BLOOD. 411 I It was new. The n ails that held the bl u e cloth upon it were bright, and fast\u2014 the plate shone like silver. Yes, it was the lid / of the coffin of Miss Clara Crofton; but 1 how came it Off\u2014 unsecured, and lying y upon the floor of the vault, while the coffin was in its proper niche? \" Gracious goodness !\" gasped Will, at length. \" What does this mean?\" The question was easy to ask, but most difficult to answer, and he stood trembling and turning over in his own mind all the most frightful explanations of what he saw that could occur to any one. \" Has sbe been buried aUve? Have the i body snatcbers been after her? How is it ' \u2014 what \u2014 what has happened?\" Then it occurred to WUl, that it wonld be just as well to look into the coffin, and * see if it were tenantless or not. If it were, he thought he should know what to think, and if the dead body was there, then he could only conclude that she had been buried alive, and had had just strength enough to force open the coffin, and cast the lid of it on the floor of the vault, and then to die in that horrible place. It required almost more courage than Will could muster to go and look into the coffin, for now that his usual indifference was completely broken down, he was as timid as any stranger to graves and vaults would have been. But curiosity is, after all, a most exciting passion, and that lent him power. \"Yes,\" he said, \" I\u2014 I will look in the coffin. I shall have bnt a poor tale to^tell to Sir George Crofton, if I do not look intqe coffin. I \u2014 I \u2014 have nothing to be afraid of.\" He advanced with trembling steps, the light shaking in his bands as he did so. He reached the coffin, and with eyes r unusually wide, he looked in : it was empty. If Clara Crofton had herself risen, and left the vault, it was quite clear she had taken with her the apparel of the grave. Will had thought that if he found tbe coffin empty, all his fears would vanish, and that he should be able to come at once to the conclusion, that she had become the prey of resurrectionists But new idea-*, as he gazed at that abandoned receptacle of the dead, began to creep across him. \" I \u2014 I \u2014 don't know,\" he muttered, \" but she may in a ghost-like kind of way be going about. I don't know whether ghosts is corpses or not. I \u2014 I wish I was out of this.\" The idea of spreading tbe sawdust in the vault now completely left him ; all he thought of was to get away, and the dread that Clara Crofton was, perhaps, hiding somewhere, and might come suddenly out upon him with a yell, got so firm a hold of him, that several times he thought he should faint with excess of terror. \"That would be too horrible,\" he said, \" I am sure I should go mad \u2014 triad\u2014 mad.\" He retreated backward to the stairs, for the coffin, empty though it was, held his gaze with a strange kind of fascinating power. He thought that if he turned round something would be sure to lay hold of him. It was a most horrifying and dis tressing idea that, and yet he could not conquer it. Of course he must turn round, it would be an awkward thing I o attempt ascending the staircase, short as it was, backward, so he felt the necessity or turning hi* back upon the vault. \" I\u2014 I will do so,\" he thought, \" and then make such a rush up the steps, that I shall be in the church in a moment. I\u2014 I can surely do that, and\u2014 and after all it's nothing really to be afraid of\u2014 it's only a matter of imagination, after all ! ob, yes, that's all, that's all. I\u2014 I will do that.\" He put this notable scheme into execu tion by turning suddenly round and mak ing a dash at the stairs, but as people generally do things badly when they do things in a hurry, he stumbled when about half-way and felt himself at the mercy of the whole of the supernatural world. \"Have mercy on me,\" he cried, \"I am going. Have mercy on me,\" He had struck thelantern so hard against the stone stairs that he had broken it into fragments, and now all was intense dark- CHAPTER XCIX. THE APPAHITION IN THE CHURCH.\u2014 WILL STEPHENS' SWOON. \u2014 THE MORNING. ob some minutes, Will Stephens con tinued to gaze in the empty coffin, as if there _ was something pe culiarly fasci nating in it, and most at tractive, and yet nothing was in it, no ness around him. He gave himself up for lost. He lay, expecting each moment to feel some dead bony fingers clutching him, and he only groaned, thinking that surely now his last hour was come; and it is a wonder vestige even of the vestments of the dead. |"], [422, "VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE ; OR, 412 that bis fancy, excited as it was, did not conjure up to him the very effect he dreaded, but it did not do so, strange to say, and he lay for full five minutes with out anything occurring to add to his terrors. got out of the vault, I feel quite different \u2014 oh, quite another thing.\" Suddenly, then, it occurred to him, that the curtain had been close on the window, when he came into the church, and follow ing npon that thought came another, namely, that it could not very well remove itself from before the casement, and that Consequently some hands, mortal or ghostly, must have done that part of the business. Then he began gradually to recover. \" If\u2014 if,\" he gasped, \" I could but reach the church, I\u2014 I think I should be safe. Yes, I should surely be safe in the body of the church. Have mercy ou me, good ghosts ; I never harmed any of you, I \u2014 I respect you very much, indeed I do. Let me go, and\u2014 I'll never say a light word of any of you again, no, never, if I were to live for a thousand years.\" As he uttered these words, he crawled np the remaining stairs, and to his great satisfaction, made his way fairly into tbe church. But then a new surprise, if it was not exactly a new fright, perhaps it was some thing of both, awaited him. Tbe curtain that had been, as be had observed when he was walking down the aisle, closely drawn across the large south window was now drawn on one side, so that a large portion of that window was exposed, and the north wind having chased away by this time entirely the damp clouds, the moon was sailing in a cloudless sky, and sending into the old church a glorious flood of light. \" What a change,\" said WiU Stephens. It was indeed a change ; the church was as light as day, save in some places where shadows fell, and they, in contrast to the silvery lightness of the moonbeams, were of a jetty blackness. But still, let the moon shine ever so brightly, there is not that distinctness and freshness of outline produced as in the direct daylight. A strange kind of hazy vapour seems to float between the eye and all objects \u2014 an indistinctness and mys teriousness of aspect, which belongs not to the sun's unreflected rays. Thus it was, that although the church was illuminated by the moon, it had a singular aspect, and would scarcely have been recognised by any one who had only seen it by the mild searching light of day. But of course WiU Stephens the sexton knew it well, and as he wiped the perspi ration from his face, he said \u2014 \" What a relief to get out of that vault, and find now that the night has turned out so fair and beautiful. I\u2014 I begin to think I have frightened myself more than I need have done\u2014 but it was that coffin lid tbat did the business. I wasn't my own man after tbat. But now that I have Here there was ample food again for all his fears, and Will Stephens almost on the instant relapsed into his former trembling and nerveless State. \" What shall I do?\" he said ; \" it ain't all over yet. What will become of me? There's something horrid going to happen, I feel certain, and that curtain has ouly been drawn aside to let the moonlight come in sor me to see it.\" With a painful expectation of his eyes being blasted by some horrible sight, he glared round him, but he saw nuthing, although the dense little mass of pews before him might have hidden many a horror. His next movement was to turn his eyes to the gallery, and all round it he carried them until he came to the window again, but he saw nothing. \" Who knows,\" he muttered, \" who knows, aster all, but that the wind in some odd sort of way may have blown the cur tain on one side? I \u2014 I wish I had the courage now to go up to the gallery, and see, but I \u2014 I don't think I should like to do that.\" He hesitated. He knew that it would sound well on the morrow sor him to be able to say that he went up, and yet it was rather a fearful thing. \"A \u2014 hem !\" he said at length, \"is any one here?\" As he made this inquiry, he took care to keep himself ready to make a dart out at the door into the churchyard, bnt as there was no response to it, he was a little encouraged. The gallery staircase was close to where he stood, and after the not unnatural hesitation of a few moments more, he approached them, and began slowly to ascend, Nothing interrupted him, all was pro foundly still, and at length he did reach the south window, and he found that the curtain was most deliberately drawn on one side, and that the window was fast, so that no vagary of the wind could have accom plished the purpose. \"Now I'll go \u2014 I'll goat once,\" he said, \"I can't stand this any longer! I'll go"], [423, "THE FEAST OP BLOOD, 413 and alarm the village\u2014 I'll\u2014 I'll make a disturbance of some sort.\" \" Awake !\" said a deep hollow voice. Will sunk upon his knees with a groan, and mechanically his eyes wandered to the direction from whence the sound came, and he saw in a pew just beneath him, and on which the moonlight now fell brightly, a human form. move and wave its arms about strangely\u00bb and deep sighs came from its lips. It was a dreadful sight to see, but at length it rose up in the grave clothes, and moved to the door of the pew. The figure in the adjoining pew opened the door and stood on one side, and the revivified corpse passed out. Slowly and solemnly it passed down the . aisle. It reached the door at which Will Stephens had entered, and then it passed away from his sight. The tall figure fol lowed closely, and Will Stephens was alone in the church. Tt was lying in a strange huddled up position in the pew, and a glance showed the experienced eye of the sexton that it was arrayed in the vestments of the dead. He tried to speak\u2014 be tried to scream he tried to pray, but all was in vain. In tense terror froze up every faculty of his body, and he could only kneel there with his face resting upon the front ofthe gal lery, and glare with aching eyes, that would not close for a moment, upon the scene below. What could he do? How could he give a sufficient alarm? Would the two horrible personages return or not? Alas ! poor Will Stephens, never was an unhappy mortal sexton in such frightful tribulation before. He knelt and shook like an as pen. At length a lucky thought entered his head. \"Awake!\" said the deep strange voice again. \"Awake!\" It was quite clear that that voice did not come from the figure in the pew, but from some one close at hand. The sexton soon saw another form. \" The bell. The bell,\" he cried, all at once finding his voice. \"To the bell.\" He sprung to bis feet, for what he was now about to do did not involve the ne cessity of going down again into the body of the church. There was a narrow stair case at the corner ofthe gallery, leading to the belfry. It was up that staircase tbat Will now struggled and tore. Iu the adjoining pew, standing upright as a statue, with one hand pointing upwards to the window, where came in the moon light, was a tall figure enveloped in a cloak. It was from the lips of that figure that the sound came, so deeply and so solemnly. \" Sister,\" it said, \" be one of us\u2014 let the cold, chaste moonbeams endow thee with your new, and strange, and horrible ex istence. Be one of us \u2014 be one of us! Hours must yet elapse ere the faint flash of morning will kill the moonbeams. There is time, sister. Awake, be one of us!\" CHAPTER C.

But when the silvery beams streamed into the church, it again pointed to the window. \"'Tis done!\u2014 she moves,\" he said. \"I have fulfilled my mission. Ha! ha! ha!'' The laugh was so terrific and unmirthful that it froze the very blood in the veins of Will, and he thought he was surely at that moment going mad. But still he did not close his eyes, still he moved not from the position whieh he had first assumed when tbe horrible noise met his ears. ertions, for the stairs were steep and nar row, and although the little church tower was by no means very high, yet the place where the bell hung was not to be reached in a moment. Perseverance, however, will do wonders, and it was reached at last. Yes, he stood panting in a little square building, in the very centre of which hung a thick rope. It was the means of tolling the bell. To seize it was the work of a moment. Tha \" 'Tis done,\" said the figure, and the arm that had been outstretched was let fall to his side. Will Stephens looked in the pew, where he had seen what appeared to be a corpse. It had altered its position. He saw it"], [424, "VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE. 414 I This was a wise conclusion for the beadle to come to, and he turned to go to sleep again, which was wise likewise, only more easy in the conception than in the execu tion, for his mind was more disturbed than he had thought it possible anything could disturb it, by the tolling of the belk Whenever he found himself just going off to sleep, he jumped awake again quite wide, crying, \u2014 \"Eh! eh I Was that the bell?\" bell swung round, and its iron tongue gave forth a loud and stunning sound. Again and again\u2014 bang\u2014 bang\u2014 bang ! went the bell, and then feeling that at all events he had given an alarm, Will Stephens turned to retrace his steps. He was half stupified by his previous fears. The noise of the bell, so close as he had been to it, had been stunning and bewildering, and WUl Stephens reeled like a drunken man. The ale too might have a little to do with that, but certainly he made a false step, and down he went head foremost from top to bottom of those old steep, narrow belfry stairs. * * * * \u2022 This sort of thing, varied by a great number of punches in the ribs from Mrs. Dorey, went on until the morning had sufficiently advanced to make it quite light enough to see objects with ordinary dis tinctness, and then, fancying that all his attempts to sleep would be futile, the vexed beadle lose. Will Stephens was right when he con sidered that the tolling of the beU would give an alarm. Most persons in the neighbourhood were awakened by it, and they listened to the seven or eight pealing sounds in surprise. What could they mean? Who was doing it? It could not be fire. Oh, dear, no. The alarm would not leave off if it were. Somebody dead \u2014 ah, yes, it was some great person in the state dead, and the news had been brought there, and so the bell was tolled, and we shall hear all about it in the morning. And so those who bad been awakened went to sleep again, and the unhappy sexton was left to his fate at the foot ot the little stairs leading up to the belfry, where he had gone with so much trouble, and produced so little effect. \" I can't sleep, that's a clear case,\" ho said, \" so I will go and see what the bell was tolled for at such an odd time of the nigbt. The more I think of it, the more I don't know what to think.'\" Full of this resolution, he went post haste to Mr. Wiggins's, and knocked loudly at his cottage door. \" Hillo ! hillo ! Wiggins.\" \" Well,\" said Wiggins, looking out of his bed-room window, with his head pic turesquely adorned by a red night-cap. \" Well, what's the matter now?\" \" That's what I want to know. Why did you toll the bell in the middle of the night?\" \" I toll the bell !\" The long weary hours of the night crept on, and at last the faint dawn of early morning showed itself upon the ocean, and in faint streaks of light in the glowing east. \" Yes, to be sure, I heard it.\" \" Yes, and I heard it, too, but it was none of my tolling, and if I had not beer. rather indisposed, Mr. Dorey, I should have got up myself and seen what it was all about. As it is, you find me cleaning myself rather early.\" \"I'U wait for you, theu,\" said Dorey. Wiggins soon made his appearance, and he and Dorey walked off together to the church, much pondering, as they went, upon the mysterious circumstance that took them there, for if neither had rung the bell they could not think who had, for al though the name of Will Stephens cer tainly occurred to them both, they thought it about one of the most unlikely things in the world that he would take the trouble to perform upon the great bell in the mid dle of the night, when it was none of his business to do so nnder any circumstances whatever. The fishermen began to ply their hazard ous and hardy trade. The birds in the gardens, and in the old lime and yew trees that shaded the church-yard, shook off their slumbers, Gradually the light ad vanced, and a new day began. But there lay poor Stephens, the victim of what he had seen and heard in the old church, and he was doomed to lie some time longer yet. There was a Mr. Anthony Dorey, who was parish beadle, and he had awakened, and heard the sound of the tolling of the well-known bell. \" I say, mother Dorey,\" he had said to his better-half, \" what's that?\" \" How should I know, idiot,\" was the polite rejoinder. \" Ob, very good.\" \" You had better get up and see.\" \" Oh, dear, no. It's no business of mine; Master Wiggins is bell-ringer; I dare say it's something, though.\" \" Nonsense,\" said the beadle; \" I hardly ever knew him to do a very civil thing.\" \"Nor I either, so you may depend, neighbour Dorey, it's not him.\" \" It's a great mystery, neighbour Wig-"], [425, "VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE; OR, THE FEAST OF BLOOD. 415 gins. T ha's just what it is, and nothing else.\" and so they went on conversing until they reached the church door ; and then the surprise of finding the smaller entrance open struck them, and they stared at each other for some moments in sUence. \"I hope it don't bode none of us no harm, that's all. Times are quite bad enough, without anything happening to make 'em worse.\" \" There's some bo dy here,\" said Wiggins at last. This sentiment, as any grumbling one always is, was acceded to by the beadle, \"In course.\" THE VAMPYRE'S REVELATION TO THE CLERGYMAN. we try to make some one answer us. H e g\u00b0The beadle advanced close to the thres hold of the door, and in as loud a tone of voice as he could command, he said\u2014 3 \"Ahem !-ahem !\u2014 Hilloa !\u2014 hilloa !\u2014 Wbat are you at there ?\u2014 Come, come, 1 m down upon you.\" \" What shall we do, Mr. Dorey ?

The beadle's face looked quito of a purple hue, and be shook in every limb. gins. , \" Nothing at all.\" \" Then, perhaps, it's nobody.\" 1 \"Well, do you know, if I thought that, I'd go in at once, like a roaring lion\u2014 I would\u2014 and show 'em who I was \u2014ah !\" \" So would I\u2014 so would I,\" responded Mr. Wiggins. After listening for some short time longer, most intently, and hearing no thing, they came to the conclusion, that although some one had evidently been there, there was no one there now ; so it would be quite safe to go into the church, always taking care to leave the door open, so that, in the event of any alarm, they could run away again, with aU the preci pitation in the world. It certainly was not one ol the most hazardous exploits in the whole history of chivalrous proceedings to enter a church in daylight, as it then was, in search of some one, who it was very doubtful was there. But to have seen the beadle and Mr. Wig gins, anybody would have thought them bound upon an enterprise of life or death, and the latter the most likely of the two, by a great deal. \" Ahem !\" cried Mr. Dorey again ; \" we are two strong, bold feUows, and we have lest our six companions \u2014 aU six feet high, at the door \u2014 ahem !\" \"I \u2014 I thought I saw a groan !\" he said. 'So \u2014 so \u2014 did \u2014 I\u2014 oh, look\u2014 theu don't you hear a horrible bundle up in that cor ner ? Ob, mercy ! I begin to think we are as good as dead men \u2014 that we are\u2014 oh, that we are. What will become of us ?\u2014 what will become of us ?\" By this time, Will Stephens, who, the reader is aware, was there to make tho groan, had got up from the foot of the bel fry-stairs, and he began to drag his bruised and stiffened frame towards the beadle and Mr. Wiggins, which they no sooner per ceived than they set off as hard as they could scamper from the place, crying out for help, as if they had been pursued by a thousand devils. In vain Stephens called after them ; they did not hear his voice, nor did they stop in their headlong flight, until they reached the door of tbe clergyman, concerning whose power to banish all evil spirits into the Red Sea they had a strong belief, and as the reverend gentleman was at break fast, the first thing they both did was to rush in and upset the tea-tray which the servant had just brought in. No effect was prodnced by this speech, which Mr. Dorey fully intended should strike terror into somebody, and after a few minutes' search, they both felt con- vinced that there was no one hidden in the lower part, of the church, and there was only the gallery to search. And yet that was a ticklish job, sor the nearer they approached the belfry, of course the nearer they approached the spot from whence the alarm had been given. It was, therefore, with rather a backwardness in going forward that they both slowly proceeded up the staircase, and finally reached the gallery, where they saw no one ; and much to their relief the want of any discovery was. \"It's all right,\" said the beadle. \"There's nobody here. Oh, how I do wish the rascals had only stayed, that's all. I'd a shown them what a beadle was\u2014 I'd a took 'em up in a twinkling\u2014 I would.

With all due respect for his cloth, we can- not help re- cording the fact that the words at the commence- ment of this chapter were precisely those that came from the lips of the reverend gentle man npon the occasion of the sudden and rather alarming irruption of the"], [427, "THE FEAST OF BLOOD. 417 beadle and the bell-ringer into his break fast parlour at the parsonage. \"We beg your pardon, sir,\" said the beadle, \"but \" at once in his own mind to divide tbe pro bable from the impossible, and therefore was it that he walked down to the church fully prepared to hear from somebody a very natural explanation of the mysterious bell-ringing in the night, which was the only circumstance that made him think that there was anything to explain, sor he had beard that himself. \" Yes, sir, we beg your pardon,\" added the bell-ringer, \" but ' \" What ?\" cried the parson, as he looked at the remains of his breakfast lying upon the hearth-rug in most admired disorder at his feet. When he reached the sacred building, he found the door open, as the beadle and the bell-ringer had ieft it, and the moment he got into the body of the church, he heard a voice say \u2014 \" Help 1 help ! will nobody help me ?\" \" Yes,\" he replied, \" of course, I will.\" \" Ob, thank Heaven !\" \"Where are you ?\" \u00ab' Here, sir. I think that's your voice, Mr. Bevan?\" \" The bell, sir\u2014 the church \u2014 the gallery \u2014a groan \u2014 a ghost\u2014 a lot of ghosts.\" Such were tha incoherent words that came, thick as hail, from the beadle and the bell-ringer. In vain the clergyman strove to get to the rights of the story. He was compelled to wait until they were both very nearly tirod out, and then he said \u2014 \" Very well, I don't understand, so you may both go away again.\" \"But, sir \" \"But, sir \" \"If one of you will speak while the other listens, I will attend, and not other wise. This is Sunday morning, and I neither can nor will waste any more time upon you.\". Nothing is so terrible to a professed 6tory-teller, and the beadle was something of tiiat class, as to tell bim you won't listen to him, so Mr. Dorey at once begged that Wiggins would either allow him to tell what had happened, or tell it properly himself. Mr. Wiggins gave way, and the beadle as diffusely as possible told the tale of the bell tolling, and the visit to the church, with the awful adventure that there occurred. \" What do you think of it, sir ?' he concluded by asking. \"I have no opinion formed as yet,\" re plied the clergyman ; \" but I will step down to tbe church now, and see.\" \" You'll take plenty o' people with you, sir.\" \" Oh; dear, no, I shall go alone. I don't gather from what you have said that there is any danger. Your own fears, too, I am inclined to think, have much exag gerated the whole affair. I dare say it will turn out, as most of such alarms usually do, some very simple affair, indeed.\" The parson took his hat, and walked away to the church as coolly as possible, leaving Mr. Dorey and Mr. Wiggins to stare at each other, and to wonder at a temerity they could not havo thought it possible sor any human being to have prac- tised. But tbe clergyman was supported by a power of which they knew little\u2014 the power of knowledge, wbich enabled him \" Ah, and I think that's your voice, Will Stephens ; I thought this would turn out some very ordinary piece of business. So your are upstairs; and did you ring the bell in thc night?\" \"I did, sir.\" \"Just so \u2014 come down then.\" \" I'm afraid I can't, sir, without some help. I have had a very bad fall, and although, thank God, no bones are broken, I am sadly shaken and bruised, so that it is wiih great pain, sir, I can crawl along, and as for getting down the stairs, why \u2014 I\u2014 I rather think I couldn't by myself, if there was a hundred pound note waiting for me below, just for the trouble of fetching, sir.\" \" Very well, I'm coming, don't move.\" Mr. Bevan ascended the staircase, and without \"a bit of pride,\" as Will Stephens. said afterwards, in telling the story, helped the bruised sexton down the gaUery steps to the body of the church, aud then he made him sit down on one of the forms, and tell bim all that had happened, wh*;h Will did from first to last, quite faithfully, not even omitting how he had stayed rotber late at the ale-house, and how terrified he had been by the curious events tbat took plaie while he was in the church, ending by bis fall lrom the stair3 leading up to the belfry. _ , , - \" Will, Will,\" said Mr. Bevan, \" the ring ing of tbe bell is good proof that you have been in the belfry, but you will scarcely ex pect me to believe the remainder of your dream.\" \"Dream, sir?\" \"Y'es to be sure.

The story need go no further. You can keep your own counsel, if you like. You have come here under the influence of strong ale, and you have gone to sleep most likely in this very vault, and in your sleep, having a very vivid dream, you have walked up into the gallery, and thence into the belfry, where no doubt you did ring the bell under the influence of your dream; and then you fell down tho belfry stairs, I believe, as you say you did.\" \"Ah!\" said WiU, \"bless you, sir. It may be so, but\u2014 \u2014 \" \" You are not convinced?\" \" There, that will do. I will convince you tbat it was nothing more, or else you will go disturbing the whole neighbourhood with this story, that it is quite a mercy I have first heard.\" \"Convince me, sir?\" \"Yes, come with mo to the vault.\" Will Stephens shrank from the proposal, and his fear was so manifest, that Mr. Bevan was, at all events, convinced that he had told him nothing but what he himself believed, and accordingly he felt still more anxious to rid Will of his nervous terror. \"You surely,\" he said, \"cannot be timid while I am with you? Come at once, and if you do not find that the late Miss Crofton, poor girl, is quiet enough in her coffin, I promise you, upon my sacred word, that I will never cease investigating this affair, and bringing it to some conclu sion. Come at once, before any curious persons arrive at the church.\" So urgent a request from the clergyman of the parish, almost might be said to amount to a command, so Will did not see how he could get out of it, without confes sing an amount of rank cowardice that even he shrunk from. \"Not quite, sir.\" \" Well, Will, you are quite right never to pretend to be convinced wheu you are not. I do not blame you for that, hut in a short time, when the effect of the affair has worn off, you will entertain my opinon.\" \" I hope, sir, I may.\" \" That will do. Now the stone must be put over this vault.\" \"Sir, if you wouldn't mind, sir \" \"What, Will?\" \"Staying a moment or two, while I empty the bag of sawdust on the floor, sir, I shan't beaminute \u2014 no, not half a minute, and then I shall have done with the vault altogether, I hope, sir.\" \" Well, sir,\" he said, \" of course with you I can have no objection.\" \"That's right Come along; there are means of getting a light in the vestry; wait here a moment.\" Will would not wait; he stuck close by Mr. Bevan, who went into the vestry, and soon procured a candle, lighted from materials he kept there under lock and key; and they went together to the vault, the stone of which was just as it had been left when WUl emerged with so much fright. \" I will go first,\" said Mr. Bevan. \" Thank you, sir.\" The clergyman descended, and WiU Stephens followed, trembling, about two stairs behind him. Little did he expect when he emerged from that vault previous to his adventures in the church, that he Bhould revisit it again so quickly. Indeed he had made a mental resolve that nothing should induce him to go down those stairs again, and yet there he was actually des cending them. So weak aro the resolutions of mortals! \"Needs must,\" thought Will, \"wheu the parson, I mean, drives!\" \" Como on, Will,\" said Mr. Bevan. _ Will looked about him, but no coffin lid was visible. There wai Miss Cr. fton's coffin in its proper niche, with the, lid on and looking as c?.lm and undisturbed as any respectable coffin could look. Will was amazed. He looked at tho coffin, and Will set to work, and although at any other time he would have been rather ashamed of letting Mr. Bevan see what a wonderfully small quantity of sawdust made up a guinea's worth, superiorconsiderations now prevailed, and he would not have spared the clergyman's company on any account. \"Now I've done, sir.\" \" Very well, follow mo.\" Will did not like to ask the clergyman to follow him, so in that difficulty, for as to his remaining behind it was out of the question, he made a rush and reached the church before Mr. Bevan could ascend two of the steps. When that gentleman did reach the church he made no remark about the precipitancy, and apparent disrespect of Will, for he put it down to its right cause, but be left the church in order to make the usual preparations sor the morn ing service, which would now commence in an hour-and-a-half. Will walked home with his empty bag, for tbe little exercise he had had sufficed to convince him that te was not so much hurt as be thought, and that the stiffness of his limbs would soon pass away, \"It's nil very well,\" he said to hitnsolf,"], [429, "THE FEAST OF BLOOD. 419 \"for Mr. Bevan to talk about dreams, but if that was one, nothing real has ever happened to me yet, that's all.\" mate and good terms with the family, that be could ahvays call whenever he pleased, so that a mere announcement of his pre sence by no means had the effect of pre paring Sir George sor any communication. \"Ah, Mr. Bevan,\" he said, when the clergyman entered tlie room, \" I am glad to see you.\" \" And I to see you, Sir George.\" \" You come to a house of mourning, sir. But that will be the case here for a long, long time. Time may and will, no doubt, do raHch to assuage our grief, but the blow is as yet too recent.\" Tears started to the eyes of Sir George Crofton as he made this allusion to his daughter, and he turned bis head aside to hide such evidences of emotion from the parson, from whom, however, he need have expected nothing but the most friendly sympathy that one human being could be stow upon another. Mr. Beyan was a man of refinement and consideration, and he let grief always have its way, seldom doing more than merely throw out, in the form of a suggestion for consideration as it .vere, that death was not the great evil it was thought to be. In such a way he generally succeeded in bringing persons smarting under the inflic tion of the loss of dear friends and rela tions much sooner to a proper sense of the subject than if he had indulged in all the canting religious exhortations that some divines think applicable to such occasions. Sir George Crofton was alone, for his two sons had gone for a stroll in the grounds. Ringwood, who still remained with the family, was in the library, where now he passed most of his time, in trying by reading to withdraw his mind from a too painful and fixed contemplation of his loss. CHAPTER CII. THE YOUNG LOVER'S MIDNIGBT -WATCH. Id the clergy- man really think what he said ? Had he no suspi cions, that after all there was something more even than he was quite willing to admit in the story told by the sexton? We shall see in good time, but at all events one thing is evident, that the parson thought it good sound policy, and it was, to endeavour to nip the thing in the bud, and by ascribing it to a dream, put it down as a subject of speculation in the place. He knew that nothing could be more dangerous than allowing any such story to pass current as a wonderful fact, and well he knew that in a short time, if such were the case, it would receive so many additions and so many cmbellishmenis, that the mischief it might produce upon the mind of an ignorant population might be extreme, and of a most regretful cha racter indeed. AU this he felt hourly, and, therefore, Will Stephens' story was to be put down as a dream. Now Mr. Bevan, it will be recollected, had urged Will to keep his own counsel, and to say nothing of the affair to any one ; but he had faint hopes only that Will would do that, very faint hopes, iu deed, for after all he, Will, was the hero of the story, and there would be a some thing extremely gratifying in telling it, and in staling what he would have done, had not his foot slipped as he came down the narrow stairs from the old belfry, and so complelety stunned him by the fall. Mr. Bevan, therefore, had very few, if any, compunctions in adopting the course he did, which was, in the evening, when there was no service at the church, to call at the Grange, to see Sit George Crofton upon the subject. Mr. ilevan v.'as ahvays a welcome guest at the Grange, and he was en those inti- He was still weak, but might be consi dered now quite convalescent. \"Pray be seated, Mr. Bevan,\" said Sir George. \" Believe me, I take it very kindly of you to come so often.\" \" Pray, dear sir, don't say another word about it \u2014 I \u2014 I am very sorry to feel my self obliged to allude to anything of an uncomfortable nature.\" \" Think nothing of doing so, my friend. Think nothing of it ; I have a master grief which drowns all others.\" \" But it is concerning that master grief, sir, that I come to speak.\" \"Indeed !\" \" Yes, sir ; will you kindly hear me?\" \" Certainly, certainly.\" \" You told me on the day following the melancholy death of your daughter, as a friend, the peculiar circumstances atten-"], [430, "VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE; OR, 420 dant upon that death. Now, I do not mean to say that what I am going to relate to you has any connection at all with those circumstances, nor would I tell you what I come to tell at all, were I not fearful that the same story with some of the usual ex aggeration of ignorance would reach you from other quarters, for it is not a matter consigned to my bosom only, or there it would remain.\" image of my lost one fills up each t of my heart. I shall listen to y Bevan, with respect, bnt my grief, is selfish, and cannot feel more t! own miseries.\" Ringwood seemed to imagine that what the parson had to say referred to something with which Clara had nothing to do ; but when, as the story proceeded, he found how intimately connected she was with the affair, his cheek flushed sor a moment, and then grew of a death-like paleness, and he sat trembling and looking in the face of Mr. Bevan, as he proceeded with his most strange relation. When he had concluded, Ringwood gave a deep groan. \" You are much affected, sir,\" said Mr. Bevan. \" You alarm me.\" \"That I feared, but deeply regret. Listen to me, and remember always as you do so, that I think the whole affair is a mere dream \u2014 a disturbed slumberer's vision \u2014 nothing more.\" Sir George Crofton did listen with breathless eagerness, and Mr. Bevan, with out detracting anything or adding any thing to the narrative of Will Stephens, told him the whole story just as Will had told it to him, concluding by saying \u2014 \"That is all, my dear sir, and I felt that my duty powerfully called upon me to be your informant upon the subject, simply, that we might be forewarned against any coarse version of the story.\" Sir George drew a long breath. \" More horr.rs I \u2014 more horrors !\" \" Crushed 1\u2014 crushed !\" was the reply. \"Oh, God !\" \" Nay, now this is not manly, sir, you feel this thing too much ; if you are so crushed, how can any one expect that from you is to proceed the necessary exertion to prove that tne story in all its particulars is but a falsehood?\" Ringwood caught at this idea in a moment. \" Nay, why should you say that?\" \"Is it not so?\" \" Exertion from me?\" he said. \" What exertions would I not make to prove such a horror to be but a creation ofthe fancy? What would I not do? What would I not suffer? You have warned me, sir. Yes, I have a duty to do\u2014 a duty to Clara's memory; a duty to you, Sir George, and a duty to myself, for did I not lovo her, and does not her gentle image still sit iu my inmost heart enshrined? I will prova that this most monstrous story is a delusion. Bear with me, gentlemen, I must think. To-morrow you shall know more, but not until to-morrow.\" \"Nay, I have already given my opinion, by saying, that I look upon the whole affair as but the phantasma of a dream.'' \" Oh ! Mr. Bevan, do not trifle with me. Is that really and truly your opinion, sir, or only said from kindness to me.\" \" It is the best opinion that I can come to.\" \" I thank you, sir\u2014 I thank you. Clara, Clara, my child, my child !\" The old man was overcome by grief, and at this interesting moment, Ringwood entered the room, with a book in hisliand. He was astonished, as well he might be, to see such a fearful relapse of grief on the part of Sir George Crofton, and he looked from him to Mr. Bevan, and from Mr. Bevan to him, for some few moments in silence, and then he said \u2014 \" Surelyall here have suffered enough, and there is no new calamity come upon this house?\" \"Tell him all,\" cried Sir George; \" tell him all. It is fit that he should know ; he is one of us now, he loved my child, and loves her memory still. I pray you, Mr. Bevan, to tell all to Ringwood, for I have not the heart to do so.\" \"I wonder,\" said Ringwood, calmly \"to hear you speak thus. I wonder to see that any new grief can come so near to tbat which we have already suffered. The He rose, and left the room. \" What does he mean ?\" said Sir George, vacantly. \"I cannot tell you, sir; but wait until to-morrow. Perhaps by then he may have proposed some plan of action, tint you or I may not think of. You will use your own discretion about communicating the strange affair to your sons, or not, sir. Upon such a point as family confidence, I never venture an opinion. Allow me to call upon you to-morrow morning, sir, when I hope to find you in better spirit-.\"' The clergyman would not have been in such haste to leave Sir George ; but as be saw Ringwood leave the room, that young man made a sign to him that he wished to see him before he lefr, and accordingly Mr. Bevan was anxious to know what it was' he had to say to him."], [431, "THE FEAST OF BLOOD. 421 When he left Sir George, he asked a servant where Mr. Ringwood was, and being told he was in the library, Mr. Bevan, being quite familiar with the house, followed him there at once, and found him pacing that apartment in great agitation, and with disordered steps. \" Thank heaven you have come, sir,\" cried Ringwood. \" Tell me, oh, tell me, what would you advise me to do, Mr. Bevan?\" CHAPTER CUT.

In the first place he thought be should be put down as a visionary, and as one who was disposed to insult the memory of Clara by imagining that the story of the sexton conld be true ; and in the second place, if anything did happen, he was afraid that the feelings of the brother might clash with his. \" Be it soj I wUl, if you like, keep watch with you.\" \" Oh, no, no ! let me be alone. All I ask of you, sir, is to provide me with the means of getting into the sacred edifice at midnight.\" \" That I will do. You shall have a private key that I have for my own use; you can let yourself in without any one knowing of your presence. But do you think you have nerve enough to go alone? if you have the smallest doubt or hesita tion, let me accompany you.\" \" No, no \u2014 I thank you, but let me go alone, and say nothing of this to Sir George. I had it in my mind when I told him I would speak to him to-morrow about what you had communicated. I would fain, if these horrors be really true, keep him in ignorance that I have verified them. But if I keep my night watch quite undisturbed, then he shall have the satisfaction of knowing that it has been so kept.\" I \" You are right in that; I wUl send the key to you in the course of another hour, and remember I am at your service if you should alter your mind, and wish for com pany. Do not hesitate about disturbing my rest.\" \" No,\" he said, \" I will go alone\u2014 I will not rest again until I have thoroughly satisfied myself that this tale is but a fabri cation of the fancy. Ob, Clara ! can it be possible \u2014 no, no. The thought is by far too\u2014 too horrible.\" It may really be considered a fortunate thing that the communication of the cler gyman was made in the evening, for had it been earlier in the day, the hours of frightful anxiety which Ringwood would have endured until the night came must have been most painful. As it was, however, the hours that would elapse ere he could venture to go to the church en his strange and melancholy errand were not many, and they passed the more quickly that, during some of them, he was making up his mind as to what be should do. \" Yes, Clara, my best beloved Clara,\" he said, \" I will rescue your sweet memory from this horrible doubt that is cast upon it, or I wUl join you in the tomb.

Be still, my heart, and let me go upon this expedi tion as a spectator merely. Time enough"], [432, "VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE. 422 will it be to become an actor, when I know more, if indeed there be more to know.\" The clergyman sent the key, according to his promise, by a confidential servant, who had orders to ask sor Mr. Ringwood, and to give it into his own hands, so that the young man was fully prepared to go, when the proper time should arrive sor him to start upon his expedition. He purposely kept very much ont of the way of Sir George Crofton and bis two sons during the remainder of the evening, for such was tbe ingenuous natureof young Ringwood, and so unused was he to place any curb upon his speech, that he dreaded letting slip some information regarding his intention to keep watch in the old church that night; in snch a case it would have been difficult to refuse company. Sir George took the advice of the cler gyman, and said nothing to any one ofthe dreadful communication that had been made to him. But he could not conceal from the family and his servants that some unusual grief was preying upon him, beyond even the sadness that hadremained after the death of his daughter. He re tired to rest unusually early, that he might eseape their curious and inquiring glances. The clock struck eleven. was uncertain, and no one could with any safety have ventured to predict whether it would be fair or rainy. Of the two, cer tainly, Ringwood would have preferred moonlight, for he wished in the church to be able to see well about him, without thinking of the necessity of a light. \" No,\" he said, as he pursued his way, \"I mnst have no light ; that would ruin all.\" By the time he reached the church, he had a better opinion of tbe weather, and from a faint sort of halo that was in the sky, he was led to believe tbat the moon's light wonld soon be visible, and enable him to see everything that might take place. The key that tbe parson had given him opened the same Uttle door by wbich Will Stephens, the sexton, had entered, and there was no difficulty in turning the lock, for it was frequently used. The yonng man paused for a moment, debating with himself whether he should fasten the door securely on the inner side, or leave it open, and at last he thought, that, considering all things, the latter was the best course to pursue. \"I do not wish,\" he said, \"to stop any proceedings, so much as I wish to see what they are. There shaU, therefore, be every facility for any one coming into the church, who may chance to have an intention so to do.\" \"It is time,\" said Ringwood, as he sprang from his seat in his bed-room. \" It is time. For the love of thee, my Clara, I go to brave this adventure. Mine are you, in death, as in life. My heart is widowed, and can know no other love.\" He armed himself with a pair of loaded pistols, for he made up his mind that if any trickery was at the bottom of the pro- ceeding, the authors of such a jest should pay dearly for their temerity, and then cautiously descending from his bed-room, he crossed the dining room, and passing through a conservatory, easily made his way out of the house, and into a flower- garden that was beyond. He thought that if he went ont of the grounds by the way of the porter's lodge, it might excite some remark, his not returning again, so he went to a part of the waU which he knew was low and rugged. \"There,\" he said, \"I can easily climb over, and by getting into the meadows make my way into the road.\" This, to a young man, was not by any means a difficult matter, and he in a few minutes more found himself quite free of the house and grounds, and making bis way very rapidly towards the church, the tower of which be could just see. The night was again a cloudy one; al though nothing bad as yet fallen, the wind He still, it will be seen, clung a little to the hope that it was a trick. When he pushed open the door that was covered with green baize, he found that in consequence of the cloth curtain being entirely drawn aside from before thesouth window, that there was not near the amount of darkness within the building that he had anticipated finding there, When his eyes got a little accustomed to it, he could even see, dimly, to be sure, but still sufficiently to distinguish the several shapes of the well known objects in the church. The pulpit, the communion table, the little rails before it, and some ofthe old monuments against the walls. The stone slab that covered the opening to the vault of the Crofton family had been before the commencement of the morning service properly secured, so that that en- trance could be walked over with perfect safety, and Ringwood carefuUy ascertained that such was the fact. \" Surely, surely,\" he said, \" it is as Mr. Bevan says. That man must have come here half stupified by ale, and have gone to sleep. The only thing that gives the slightest semblance to such a tale, is the ad venture of that most mysterious man who was reclaimed from the sea.\""], [433, "VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE ; OR THE FEAST OF BLOOD. 423 Yes, Ringwood was right. That was the circumstance, full of dread and awful mystery as it was, which sufficed to make anything else probable and possible. And what had become of him?

After some little consideration, and look ing about him as well as thesemi-darkness would permit him, he thought that he could n5t by any possibility do better than get into the pulpit. From there he could readily turn about in any direction from whence any noise roight proceed, at the same time that it was something like a opinion even that the Mr. Smith ot the bone-house was the same person who had played so strange a part in the church. The reader will have his own opinion. \" Where shall I bestow myself,\" thought Ringwood; \" I ought to be somewhere from whence I can get a good view of the whole church.\" No. 54."], [434, "VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE; OR, 424 position which could not be very well at | tacked except with fire-arms, and if such weapons were used against him, he should have the great advantage of seeing who was his assailant.

This continued sor a long time, as he thought, and more than once he tried to ascertain the progress of the hours by look ing at bis watch, but the dim light baffled him. place. There was something very awful, and solemn, and yet beautiful about the faint view he got of the old conventicle-looking church from its pulpit, and irresistibly, had he chosen to resist it, there came to his lips a prayer to Heaven for its aid, its pro tection, and its blessing upon his enter prise. \" How long have I been here?\" he asked himself; \" I mnst not measure the time by my feelings, else I should call it an age.\" At that moment the old church clock began to chime, and having proclaimed the four quarters past eleven, it, with its deep toned solemn bell, struck the hour of twelve \u2014 Ringwood carefully counted the strokes, so that, although it was too dark to see his watch, he could not be deceived. How much calmer and bappier he felt after that. How true it is, as Prospero says, that prayer \u2014 \u2014 \" Pierces so that it assaults Mercy itself, Mid frees all faults.\" Who is there in the wide world who has not felt the benign influence of an appeal to the great Creator of all things, under cir cumstances of difficulty, and of distress?

ES, it was just twelve o'clock, that hour when But there are none. A reliance upon divine mercy is one of the attributes of humanity, and may not be turned aside, by even all the wickedness and the infidelity that may be arrayed against it. \"AU is 6tUl,\" murmured Ringwood. \"The stillness of the very grave is here. Oh, my Clara! methinks, without a pang of mortal fear, I could converse in such an hour as this with thy pure and un sullied spirit!\" In the enthusiasm of the moment, no doubt, Ringwood could have done so, and it is a wonder that his most excited im- all that is hu- man feels a sort of irksome dread, as if the spirits of those who have gone from the great world were too near, loading the still night air with the murky vapours of the grave \u2014 that myste rious hour at wbich it is beUeved by many that agination did not conjurenp some apparent semblance of the being whom he loved so devotedly, and whose image he so fondly cherished, even although she had gone from him. \" Graves give up their dead.

The sound of his own voice convinced him of the impropriety of such speeches, when he came there as an observer. A chilliness came over Ringwood, and he fancied a strange kind of light was in the church, making objects more visible than in their dim and dusky outlines they had been before. \"Why do I tremble?\" he said, \"why do I tremble? Clouds pass away from be fore the moon, that is all. Soon there may be a bright light here, and lo, all is still; I hear nothing but my own breathing ; I see nothing but what is common and natu ral. Thank heaven, all will pass away in quiet. There will be no horror to recount \u2014 no terrific eight to chiU my blood. Rest, Clara, rest in Heaven.\" \"Hush I hush!\" he said. \"Be stUl, be still.\" It was evident to him that many clouds were careering over the face of the moon, for at times tbe church would get very"], [435, "THE FEAST OF BLOOD. 425 Ten minutes passed away, and there was no alarm; how wonderfully relieved was Ringwood. Tears came to his eyes, but they were the natural tears of regret, such as he had shed before for her who had gone from him to the tomb, and left no trace behind, but in tbe hearts of those who loved her. things that* had ensued regarding the after death condition of that fair girl. The noise increased each moment, and finally there was a sudden crash. \" She comes \u2014 she comes !\" gasped Ring wood. He grasped the front of the pulpit with a frantic violence, and then slowly and solemnly there crossed Vis excited vision a figure aU clothed in white. Yes, white flowing vestments, and he knew by their fashion tbat they were not worn by the Uving, and it was some inhabitant of the tomb that he now looked upon. He did not see the face. No, that for a time was hidden from him, but his heart told him who it was. Yes, it was his Clara. \" Yes,\" he said, mournfully, \" she has gone from me, but I love her still. Still does the fond remembrance of all that she was to me linger at my heart. She is my own, my beautiful Clara, as she ever was, and as, while life remains to me, ever will be.\" At the moment that he uttered these words a slight noise met his ears. In an instant he sprang to his feet in the pulpit, and looked anxiously around him. It was no dream. It was no vision of a too excited fancy, for until those pal pable sounds, and that most fearfully pal pable form crossed his sight, he was rather iucUned to go the other way, and to fancy what the sexton had reported was nothing but a delusion of his overwrought brain. Oh, that he could but for one brief moment have found himself deceived. \" What was tbat?\" he said. \" What was that?\" AU was still again, and he was npon the point of convincing himself that the noise was either some accidental one, or the creation of his own fancy, when it came again. He had no doubt this time. It was a \"Speak !\" he gasped ; \"speak, speak!\" There was no reply. \" I conjure you, I pray you, though the sound of your voice should hurl mo to perdition \u2014 I implore you, speak.\" All was silent, and the figure in white moved on slowly but surely towards the door of the church, but ere it passed out, it turned for a moment, as if for the very purpose of removing from the mind of Ringwoood any lingering doubt as to its identity. He then saw the face, oh, 60 weU-known, but so pale. It was Clara Crofton ! \" 'Tis she !\u2014 'tis she !\" was all he could say. perceptible, scraping, strange sortof sound, and he turned his whole attention to the direction from whence it came. With a cold creeping chill through bis frame, he saw that that direction was the one where was the family vault of the Croftons, the last home of her whom he held still in remembrance, and whose memory was so dear to him. He felt the perspiration standing upon his brow, and if the whole world had been the recompense to him for moving away from where he was he could not have done so. All he could do was to gaze with bated breath and distended eyes upon the aisle of the church from whence tbe sound came. It seemed, too, as if some crevice in the clouds had opened at the moment, in order that he should with an absolute certainty see tbe countenance of that solemn figure, and then all was more than usually silent again. The door closed, and the figure was gone. That something of a terrific nature was now about to exhibit itself, and that the night would not go off without some terri ble and significant adventure to make it remembered, he felt convinced. All he ureaded was to thiuk for a moment what it might be. He rose in the pulpit, and clasped his hands. Irresolution seemed for a few mo ments to sway him to and fro, and then he rushed down into the body of the church. His thoughts ran on Clara, and he murmured forth in the most agonising accents \u2014 \"I'll follow it,\" he cried, \"though it lead me to perdition. Yes, I'll follow it.\" He made bis way to the door, and even as he went he shouted \u2014 \"Clara\u2014 Clara\u2014 Clara!\" He reached the threshold of the ancient church ; he gazed around him distractedly, for be thought that be had lust aU sight of | \" Anything \u2014 any sight but the sight of her.

No\u2014 no, even in the darkness and against the night sky, he saw it once again in its sad-looking dealh raiments. He dashed forward. The moonbeams at this instant being freed from some dense clouds that had in terposed between them and this world, burst forth with resplendent beauty. There was not a tree, a shrub, nor a flower, but what was made distinct and manifest, and with the church, such was the almost unprecedented lustre of the beautiful planet, that even the inscriptions upon the old tablets and tombs were dis tinctly visible. Such a refulgence lasted not many minutes, but while it did, it was most beautiful, and the gloom that followed it seemed doubly black. \"Stay, 6tay,\" he shouted, \"yet a mo ment, Clara ; I swear that what you are, that will I be. Take me over to the tomb with you, say but that it is your dwelling place, and I wiU make it mine, and de clare it a very palace of the affections.\" The figure glided on. It was in vain that he tried to keep up with it. It threaded the churchyard among the ancient tombs, with a gliding speed that soon distanced him, impeded, as he continually was, by eome obstacle or another, owing to looking at the appatition he foUowed, instead of the ground before him. with all tbe carefulness and all tho energy and courage he had brought to bear upon that night's proceedings, he was soiled. Could anything be more agonising than this to such a man as Ringwood \u2014 he who loved her so, that he bad not shrunk from ber, even in death, although she had so shrunk from bim? \"I will find her \u2014 I will question her,\" he cried. \"She shall not escape me; living or dead, sbe shall be mine. 1 will wait for her, even in the tomb.\" Before he carried out tbe intention of going actually into the vault to await her return, he thought he would take one more glance at the churchyard with the hope of seeing her there, as he could observe no indications ef her presence in the church. With this view he proceeded to the door, and emerged into the dim Ught. He called upon her again by name, and be thought he heard some faint sound in the church behind him. To turn and make a rush into the building was the work of a mo ment. He saw something \u2014 it was black instead of white \u2014 a tall figure \u2014 it advanced to wards him, and with great force, before he was aware tbat an attack was at all inten ded, it felled him to the ground. The blow was so sudden, so unexpected, and so severe, tbat it struck him down in a moment before he could be aware of it. To be sure, he had arms with him, but the anxiety and agony of mind he endured that night, since seeing the apparition come from the tomb, had caused uim to forget them. Still, on he went, heedless whither he was conveyed, sor he might be said to be dragged onward, so much were all his faculties both of mind and body intent upon foUowing the apparition of his be loved. Once, and once only, the figure paused, and seemed to be aware that itwas followed, for it flitted round an angle made by one of the walls of the church, and disappeared from bis eyes.

Si t u a t e d not very far from the \" Clara\u2014 Clara !\" he shouted. \" 'Tis I \u2014 you know my voice, Clara \u2014 Clara!\" She was not to be seen, and then the idea struck him that she must have re-en tered the church, and he, too, turned, and crossed the threshold. He fingered there for a moment or two, and the whole build ing echoed to the name of Clara, as with romantic eagerness he called upon her by name to come forth to him. Those echoes were the only reply. Maddened \u2014 rendered desperate beyond all endurance, he went some distance into the building in search of her, and again he called. church, and almost close to the church yard, upon which its little garden abutted, was a cottage, the very picture of rural neatness and beauty. In the winter it was beautiful and p.ciuresque, but in the sum- It was in vain ; she had eluded bim, and"], [437, "THE FEAST OF BLOOD. 427 mer time, when its porch was overrun with the woodbine aud the sweet clematis, it was one of the sweetest of abodes that content and happiness could ever live iu. This cottage was inhabited by an old woman and her only child, a young girl of sixteen, beautiful as a rose, and as guileless as an angel. They contrived to live npon a small annuity tbat the mother had from a family in whose service she spent the best years of her life, and who, with a generosity tbat would be well to be abun dantly and extensively imitated, would not see their old dependant want. These two innocent and blameless per sons had re'.ircd to rest at nine o'clock, their usual hour, and had slept the calm sleep of contentment until about half-past one, when tbe mother was awakened by a loud and piercing shriek from her daugh ter's chamber. \" Oh, mother, tell me, convince me that it was only a dream.\" \" What, my child?\u2014 ob, what?\" Trie girl trembled so much that it was only by the utmost persuasion that the fol lowing account was got from her of the cause of her fright. She said that she had gone to sleep as usual within a very few minutes after going to bed, that she enjoyed a calm and unin terrupted slumber, the duration of which she had no means whatever of guessing, but she was partially awakened by a noise at the window of her room. She instantly rose and stood looking at the window, on which a sort of shadow seemed to pass without, which alarmed her exceedingly. Still as it did not come again, and as she certainly had not been fully awake when she sprung from her bed, she had thought it quite possible tbat aU might be a dream, and had forborne from making any alarm upon the subject. After some hesitation, she had persuaded herself to go to bed again, and when there, although she sometimes started awake fan cying she heard something, she at length yielded to sleep, and again slept soundly for a time, until a new circumstance awa kened her. She thought sbe felt something touching her about the neck, and after opening her eyes, the moonlight, which at that moment happened to be very bright, disclosed to her a white figure standing by the side of her bed, the face of which figure was lean ing over her, and within a very few inches of her own. Terror at first deprived her of all power of speech or motion, but as the figure did not move, she at length gave utterance to her fears in that shriek which had come from her lips, and so much alarmed the mother. This was all the young girl could say, with the exception that the figure when she shrieked appeared to glide away, but where to she haa no means of teUing, for some clouds at that moment came again over the face of the moon. To spring from her humble couch was the work of a moment. \"Anna, Anna! my child, Anna !\" she 6hrieked. As she did so, she rushed across the small stair landing which separated the two, and the only two upper rooms of the cottage, and was about to enter her daugh ter's room, when the door of it was opened from within, and the old dame's heart died within her, as she saw a figure upon the threshold, attired in the vestments of the grave, and opposing her entrance. Was it a dieam, or did she really see such a sight? Aghast and trembling the mother stood, unable for a moment or two to speak, and as she lay fainting upon the landing, she thought that something passed her, but she could not be quite sure, as it was at the instant her faculties were flitting from her. How long she lay in that seeming death she knew not, and when she recovered, it was some sew minutes before recoUection came back to her, and she really remem bered what had so completely overpowered her. But when her reason did resume its sway, and she recollected tbat it was some danger to Anna which had first alarmed her, she called her loudly by name. \"Anna, Anna, speak to me.\" \" Mother, mother,\" replied the young girl. \"Oh, come to me.\" These words supplied strength to the old woman, and rising, she made her way immediately into the chamber of her daughter, w hm she found in an agony of fear ; a light was procured, and then Anna flung herself upon her mother neck, and wept abundantly. The mother was much affected and terrified, and at first sho thought of calling up her neighbours, but at length, as the night was considerably advanced, and the intruder gone, they agreed to let the matter rest tUI morning, and the mother retired to her room again. How long in was before the shriek from her daughter's room came again she did not know, but come again it did. Yes, again came the dreadful shriek. It was\u2014 it could be no delusion now \u2014"], [438, "VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE; OR, 428 the fisherman, such a disturbance was made all over the neighbourhood, that they were soon likely to have more assistance than could be usetul. and the mother once more sprung from her couch to rush to the rescue of her Confused and bewildered, she darted onward to the chamber, but the door was fast, nor could all her exertions suffice to open it. , _, \u201e \"Anna, Anna 1\" she shouted, \"speak to me. One word only, my child, my child.\" The people living the nearest were soon roused, and they roused others, while the distracted woman, who beUeved Anna was dead, called for justice and for vengeance. The alarm spread from house to house \u2014 from cottage to ball \u2014 and, in the course of half-an-hour, most of the inhabitants of the vUlage had risen to bear the old dame's account of the horrible proceeding that had taken place that night in the cottage. Exaggeration was out of the question. The fact itself was more than sufficient to induce the greatest amount of horror in the minds of all who heard it ; and there was one, and only one, whose information enabled him to give a name to the appari tion that had assaulted Anna. That one was the schoolmaster of the place, and he, after hearing the story, said \u2014 \" If one could persuade oneself at all of the existence of such horrors, one would suppose that a vampyre had visited tho cottage.\" This was a theme that was likely to be popular. The schoolmaster foolishly gave way to the vanity, and explained what a vampyre was \u2014 or was supposed and said to be ; and soon the whole place was in a state of the most indescribable alarm upon the subject. AU was stiU. The trembling mother placed her ear to the door, and she heard a strange sucking sound, as if an animal were drinking with labour and difficulty. Her head seemed to be on fire, and her senses were on the point of leaving her, but she did manage to reach her own room. She flew to the little casement\u2014 she dashed it open. \" Help ! help ! help !\u2014 for tbe love of God, help I\" There was no reply. Again she raised her voice in shrieking wild accents. \" Help !-murder !\u2014 help !\" \" What is it?\" shouted a man's voice. It was one who was going some distance to take in his fishing nets. \" Oh ! thank God, some human being hears me ! Come in, come in !\" \" How am I to get in?\" \" Stay a moment, and I will come down and open the cottage door for you. For the love of mercy do not go away.\" Trembling and terrified to a dreadful excess, the old woman went down stairs and let the man into tbe cottage, when they both proceeded up to the chamber of the daughter. \" What do you suppose is the matter?\" asked the fisherman. As yetthe horrible news had notreached the Grange, but it was destined soon to do so ; and better would it havo been that any one had at once plunged a dagger in the heart of poor Sir George Crofton than that theie should be thought to be such a horrible confirmation of his worst fears. \" Oh ! I know not \u2014 I know not ; but twice to-night \u2014 twice has this dreadful alarm happened. Do not leave ns\u2014 ob, do not.\" To be sure, his daughter was not named, but he received the news with a scream of anguish, and fell insensible into the arms of his son. \" I don't want ; but I should hardly think thieves would find it worth their while to come here at aU for what they would get. You must have been dream ing.\" \" Oh, that I conld think so !\" Anna's chamber was reached ; and there, to the horror of the mother, she was found lying perfectly insensible on her bed, with a quantity of blood smeared about her neck. All was confusion. The servants ran hither and thither, not knowing what to do, and it was not until Mr. Bevan arrived that something like order was restored. He as a privileged friend assumed for the nonce a kind of dictatorship at the Grange, and gave orders, which were cheerfully and promptly obeyed. Then he desired a strictly private interview with Sir George. It was, of course, granted to him ; but the old baronet begged that Charles and Edwin might now know aU. It was Emma alone from whom be wished to keep the awful truth. \" Why, it's a murder !\" cried the fisher man ; and firmly impressed with such a belief, he ran out of the house to spread an alarm. The window of the chamber was wide open, and from that the mother now cried aloud for help ; so that between her and"], [439, "THE FEAST OF BLOOD. 429 smaU private entrance at which I usually go in myself; in fact, it was my own pri vate key, for I at times visit the church, and wish to do so, when I am not expected by those who bave the ordinary charge of it.\" CHAPTER CVI.

Well, then, I say I gave that key, but it was my sympathy with his evident distress rather than my judg- ment which consented to do so, and I had hardly done it, when I began to busy myself with conjectures, and to deeply regret that I had yielded to him so easily. 'What if he, in his excited and grief- stricken state of mind, should come to some serious mischief?' I said to myself, 'should not I be very much to blame? Would not all prudent persons say that I did very wrong to send a man in such a condition of mind into a church at mid- night, alone?' \" \"Your motives and your known charac- ter, sir, would protect you,\" said Charles. \" I hope so,\" continued Mr. Bevan. \" I think it would from all other charges, but imprudence ; and if any great mischance had befallen Ringwood, I should not so readily bave forgiven myself, as others might have been Induced to forgive me.\" \"I understand that feeling,\" said Sir George. \" Well, then, with snch sensations tug- ging at my heart, no wonder I could not rest, and so at a little after twelve I rose, and hastUy dressing myself, I left my house as noiselessly as possible, and made my way towards the church. The moon's light was at tbat time obscnred, but every spot was so famifiar to me, that I was able to go with speed, and I soon reached the venerable building. I walked round it, untU I came to the door, the key of which I had given to Mr. Ringwood; it was open, but the moment I crossed the threshold, I stumbled on his insensible form.\" .. \" Go onl go on ! he had seen something terrible,\" gasped Sir George; \"lam nerved, I think, for tha very worst; I pray you, sir, go on, and tell me all. \"I will, Sir George, because I feel con vinced it is my duty to conceal nothing in this transaction, and because I think you had better more calmly and dispassionately, and without exaggeration, hear from me all that is to be told.\" \"That is a good reason, sir, saia Edwin. \" We should, of course, hear aU from other sources, and, probably, with all the aids that a feeling for the marvellous could append to it.\" \" That is my impression. When, then, reluctance that the clergyman spoke. \"Sir,\" he said to the old ba- ronet, \" and you, my yonng gentlemen, I am afraid \u2014 in countenancing a supposition so utterly at variance with all my own notions and feelings; but my abhorrence of a secret impels me to speak.\" \" Say on, sir\u2014 say on,\" cried Sir George. \" Perhaps we are better prepared to hear what you have to tell us, than you ima gine.\" After this Mr. Bevan had less reluctance to speak, and he said, \u2014 \"I was aware, although yon all were not, that Mr. Ringwood intended to keep watch last night in the chnrcb, in order to tests the truth of what had been told by WiU Stephens, the sexton. I did all I could to persuade him from making the attempt, but when I found that nothing else would satisfy him, I thought it prudent to give him the means of carrying out what had become such a fixed intention with him, that to oppose it Was to do far more mischief than to grant it all the aid I had it in my power to do.\" Sir George gave a nod of assent. \" He went there,\" continued Mr. Bevan, \" with a private key of my own, and took his place in the church.'' \" I wish, sir, you had been with him,\" said Edwin. \"Yes,\" added Charles. \"If you, with your cool, calm, unbiassed judgment had been there, we should have been much bet ter able to come to a correct conclusion about what occurred; for that something did occur, or was supposed by Ringwood to do so, we can well guess.\" \"I wish, indeed, I had been there,\" said Mr. Bevan, \"but he begged so earnestly to be allowed to go alone, that I had not the heart to refuse him.\" \"And what happened, sir?\" \"I will tell you. I gave him a key which admitted bim to tbe chnrcb, by the"], [440, "VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE. 430 \" Oh, if we could but think it unreal,\" said Sir George, glancing at his sons, as if to gather their opinions of the matter from their countenances. I stumbled over a person lying just within the little private door of the church, I had no immediate means of knowing who it was; I tell you it was Ringwood, because I afterwards discovered as much. I had the means of getting a light; when I did so, I sound Ringwood lying in a swoon, while, at the same time, I could not bnt notice a large bruise upon his forehead. \"Of course, my first duty was to look alter him, instead of troubling myself abont his assaUant, and having placed him in as convenient a posture as I could, I hurried home again, and roused up my servants. With their assistance I got him to my house, and placed him in bed.\" \" And did you search the church, sir?\" \" I did. I went back and searched it thoroughly, but found nothing at aU sus picious. Everything was in its right place, and I could not account for the affair at all, because of the wound that Ringwood had. I was most anxious to hear from him that he had had a fall.\" \" I will cling to such a thought,\" said Charles, \" until I am convinced otherwise through the medium of my own senses.\" \" And I,\" said Edwin. \"You are right,\" added Mr. Bevan. \"I never, in the wholecourse of my experience, heard of anything of which people should be so slow of believing in, as this most un comfortable affair. You now know all, and it is for yourselves, of course to make whatever determination you think fit. If I might advise, it would be that you all take a short tour, perhaps on the continent, for a time.\" \"Mr. Bevan,\" said Sir George, in a kindly tone, \" I am greatly obliged to you. The suggestion, I know, springs ftom the very best and friendly motives; but it carries with it a strong presumption that you really do think there is something in all this affair which it would have been aa well to have settled in my absence.\" \"But \u2014 but,\" said Sir George, falter ingly, \"he told a different story?\" \"He did.\" The clergyman could not deny but that some such feeling was at the bottom of his advice; but still he would not admit that he was at all convinced of the reality of what was presumed to have happened, and a short pause in the conversation ensued, after which Sir George spoke with a solemn air of determination, saying to his sons, aa well as to his friend and pastor, Mr. Bevan : \" When I tell you tbat I have made a determination from which nothing but the hand of Heaven visiting me with death shall move me, I hope no one here wUl try to dissuade me from carrying it out.\" After such an exordium it was a difficult thing to say anything to him, so he con tinued \u2014 \" A story which yon will not keep from ns.\" \"I do not feel myself justified, as I have said, in keeping it from you. This is it.\" The clergyman then related to the family of the Croftons what is already known to the reader concerning the adven tures of Ringwood in the old church, and which that morning, upon his recovery, Ringwood had told to bim most circum stantially. We need scarcely say that this recital was listened to with the most agonised feel ings. Poor Sir George appeared to be most completely overcome by it. He trembled excessively, and could not com mand himself sufficiently to speak. Tbe two brothers looked at each other in dismay. \" Now, I pray you all to consider this matter more calmly,\" said Mr. Bevan, \" than you seem inclined to do.\" \" Calmly 1\" gasped Sir George Crofton; \"calmly!\" \" Yes\u2014 what evidence have we after aU that the whole affair is anything more than a dream of Mr. Ringwood's?\" \"Does he doubt it?\" \" No \u2014 I am bound to teU you that he does not; but we may well do so for all that. He is the last person who iB likely to give in to the opinion that it is a mere vision, so strangely impressed as it is upon his ima gination. RecoUect always tbat he went to the church prepared to see something.\" \" My child was dear \u2014 very dear to me in life, and I have no superstitious fears concerning one who held such a place in my affections.

Moreover, I wUl not trust my own imagination entirely \u2014 we will all three go, and then we cannot be deceived. This is my most solemn resolution.\" \" I have only one thing to say regarding it,\" said Mr. Bevan ; \" that is, to prefer"], [441, "VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE ; OR, THE FEAST OF BLOOD. 431 prevent any disastrous circum- stances from arising. Besides, his mind was moreclear than Sir George's, be considered, after the severe shock it had sus- tained in the loss of his dear child, and the other melancholy atten- dant circumstances with which the reader is well acquainted. Mr. Bevan also argued in his mind, that if anything of an extraordinary character should take place \u2014 something out of the common methodical calcula- tion of mankind, he should be enabled to make his deductions from what he saw and heard with far greater clearness and fairness than con'd be the case in so interested a person as Sir George really was. In the pur- suits of life Sir George had been active and energetic, and any- thing in the ordinary run of matters might be well placed in bis hands; but where the imagina- tion was likely to be played on through the feelings, Mr. Bevan thought any but Sir George's judgment would be preferable. \" Say nothing of what h.?s been determined on to any one,\" said . Sir George, \"keep it a profound ; secret, sir, and this night will . put an end to the agony of doubt.' > \" Depend upon me.

He had done what he scarcely expected, that is, got a consent to accompany him to the night vigil, and at p'i events, let what would happen, he, as a more disinterested party than the others, \u2022would be able, probably, to interfere and No. 55."], [442, "VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE; OR, 432 operations or of what was contemplated as their result, he would have done his best to adopt some course to prevent any disas trous collision. Thus then the affair was settled, so far satisfactorily, that there was to be a watch actually now in tho vault, so that there could be no delusion, no trick practised. What will be the result will be shown very shortly ; in the meantime we cannot but tremble at what that attached and nearly heart-broken father may have still to go through. The excitement, too, in tho village was immense ; sor the story of the vampyre's attack upon the young girl was fresh in everybody's mnutb, and it lost nothing of its real horrors by the frequency with which it was repeated, and the terror- stricken manner iu which it was dilated upon. We, however, With all the data and ma terials of this most singular narrative be fore us, are enabled to detail to the reader facts and occurrences as they took place actually, without awaiting the arrival of those periods at which they reach the know ledge of those actors in 'the gloomy drama of real life. Our readers, then, will please to know that the excitement among the inhabitants of the place was of that violent and over- bearing description, that all the occupa- tions of the villagers were abandoned, and a spirit of idleness, sadly suggestive of mis- chief, began to be prevalent among them. This feeling was increased by frequent visits to the ale-house, the liqnor of which was well esteemed by Will Stephens, as may be readily imagined ; and towards evening the large, old-fashioned parlour of that place of entertainment became crow- ded with a motley assemblage, whose sole purpose in meeting together was to drink strong ale, and discuss the irritating and exciting subject of the appearance of the vampyre in the village. This discussion, from being at first, a sober, serious, and alarmed one, became noisy and violent ; and at length a black- smith, who was a great maa in the politics of the place, and who of all things in the world most admired to hear his own voice, rose and addressed his compeers in some- thing of a set speech. \"Listen to. me,\" he said ; \"are we to have the blood sucked out of all our bodies CHAPTER CVII. THE GltAND CONSULTATION AT THE ALE* HflUSE. \u2014 THE AWFUL SUGGESTION. ir George Crofton and his family could form no idea, owing to not being in a position to know, of the state Of excite- ment produced in the village by the mys- terious and frightful attack which had been taade upon the widow's daughter. When people are very much absorbed with their own grief, they are apt to set a lighter value upon those cf others, and thus it was that the family of the Croftons was so entirely taken up with what itself felt and had to do that there was little room for sympathy with others. Mr. Bevan likewise, from his peculiar and respectable position, was not likely to be made the depository of gossiping secrets; the inhabitants of that little place were in the habit of approaching him with respect, so that although, as we are aware, he had heard from Will Stephens, the sexton, a full and particular account of what had happened to him in the old church, and was likewise cognisant of the story of the midnight attack upon the widow's daugh ter, he was not fully aware of the startling effect which those circumstances had had npon the small population of that fishing village. We are bound to believe that if he had had any idea of the real result of those by a lot of vampyres ? Is our wives and daughters to be murdered in the middle of the night ?\" \" No, no, no !\" cried many voices ; \"certainly not.\" \" Is we to be made into victims, or isn't we ? What's Sir George Crofton anrl his family to us ? To be Sure he's the land lord of some of us, and a very good land lord he is, too, as long as we pay our rent.\" \" Hear, hear, hear !\" \" But there's no saying how long he might be so, if we didn't.\" \"Bravo, Dick !\" cried the master ofthe place, handing the orator a pot. \" Bravo, Jjick ! take a pull at that, old fellow.\" \" Thank you, Muggins. Now, what I proposes is \u25a0' \"Stand on a chair, and let's all hear you.\" \" Thank you,\" said the blacksmith ; and getting upon a chair, he was about to com-"], [443, "THE FEAST OF BLOOD. 433 meuce again, when some one advised him to get upon the table, but in an effort to accomplish that feat, he unfortunately trod upon what was a mere flap of the table, \u25a0which bad net sufficient power to support his weight, and down he came amid an assemblage of pots, jugs, and glasses, which made a most alarming crash. This roused the fury of the landlord, who had no idea of being made such a sufferer in the transaclion, and he accord ingly began to declaim heavily at his loss. A dispute arose as to how he was to be repaid, and it was finally settled tbat a general subscription would be the best mode of reimbursing him. If anything was wanting to work up the feelings of the topers at the public-house to the highest pitch of aggravation, it cer tainly was their having to disburse for breakages a sum of money which, if Uqui fied, would have trickled most luxuriously down their throats. They were conse quently ripe and ready for anything which promised vengeance npon anybody. The blacksmith was not discomfited by his fall. When is a man who is fond of of a trial of the practicability of the plan. Both parties seemed to give some conside ration to the proposition, and they were by far too much engaged in thinking of the advice which had been given them, to pay much attention to the quarter from whence it had emanated ; more particularly, too, as from his age and infirmities, he was in capacitated from carrying it out, or from giving any active assistance to those who were disposed to do so. A great many efforts were made to get him to say more, particularly with reference to the case under consideration, as being no common one, but the octogenarian had made his effort, and he only replied to the remonstrances of those who, alternately by coaxing and bullying, strove to get information from him, by a vacant stare. \" It's of no use,\" s&id the butcher, \" you'll get nothing more now from old Timothy : he's done up now, that's quite clear, and ten to one if the excitement of to-night won't go a good way towards slaughtering him before his time.\" \"Well, it may be so,\" cried the black smith, \" but still it's good advice, and as I said before it comes to this \u2014 is we to be afraid to lay down in our beds at night, or isn't we?\" hearing himself talk discomfited by any thing ? and he soon resumed his oration in the following words \u2014 \"Is we to be put upon in this kind of way ? Why, we shan't be able to sleep in our beds. All I asks is, is we to put up with it ?\" Before any reply could be made to this interrogatory, the old clock that was in tbe public-home parlour struck the hour of eleven, and another peal of thunder seemed to be answering to the tinkling sounds. \"But what are we to do ?\" said one. \" Ah ! there's the question,\" said the blacksmith. \" I don't know exactly.\" \" Let's ask old Timothy Brown,\" said the butcher, \"he's the oldest man among us.\" \"It's a rough night,\" said one. \"I thought there would be a storm before morning by the look of the sun at setting \u2014 it went down with a strange fiery red ness behind a bank of clouds. I move for going home.\" This was assentJ-1 to ; and accordingly the individual mentioned was questioned as to his ideas of the way of avoiding the alarming catastrophe which seemed to be impending over them. He advised them to wait patiently till the next night, and keep awake till the unwelcome nocturnal visitor made its appearance, when who- ever it might visit was boldly to assail it, without any fear of the consequences to himself, till further assistance could be procured. After Timothy Brown had delivered himself of this piece of advice, a dead silence ensued among the late bois- terous company. There were many dis sentients, and a few who seemed in favour \"Who talks of going home,\" cried the blacksmith, \"when vampyres are abroad? Hasn't old Timothy said, that a stormy night was the very one to settle the 'thing in?\" \"No,\" cr';d another, \"he did not say night at all.'' \" I don't care whether he said night or day ; I've made up my mind to do some thing ; there's no doubt aoout it but that a vampyre is about the old church. Who'll come with me and ferret it out? It will be good service done to everybody's fire side.\""], [444, "VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE ; OR, 434 followed by the rabble, rushed forward in the direction of the sacred edifice. CHAPTER CVIII. * * As the hour of eleven has struck, and as tbe reader is aware that at that hour Sir George Crofton and his two sons, accom panied by Mr. Bevan, had agreed to go to the church on their melancholy errand, we will leave the noisy brawlers of the ale house for the purpose of detailing the pro ceedings of thos- whose fortunes we feel m ire -losely interested In. The baronet was by no means wavering in his determination, notwithstanding it had been made at a time of unusual excite ment, when second thoughts might have been allowed to step in, and suggest some other course of proceeding. Now, Mr. Bevan was not without his own private hopes that such would be the case ; for what he dreaded above all other things was, the truth ofthe affair, and that Sir George would have the horror of dis covering that there was much more in the popular superstition than, without ocular demonstration, he would have been inclined to admit. THE NIGHT WATCH.\u2014 THE VAULT. Twas each mo [ ment becom- I ing a mo e I difficult affair I to carry on f anyconversa ' tion in the i public-house ; parlour, for | not only did f the thunder \u2022 each moment | almost drown . the voices of the speakers with its loud reveberations, but now and then such a tremendous gnst of wind would sweep round the house that it would be quite impossible for any one to make himself heard amidst its loud howling noise. These were circumstances, however, which greatly aided, no doubt, in the get ting up ot a superstitious feeling in the minds of the people there assembled, which made them ripe for any proposition, which perhaps in their soberer moments they would have regarded with considerable dismay ; hence when the blacksmith rushed to tbe door, crying \u2014 \" Who will follow me to the old church and lay hold of the vampyre?\" about half a-dozen of the boldest and most reckless \u2014 and be it told to their honour (if there be any honour in such an enterprise, which, after all, was a grossly selfish one,) they were the worst characters in the village \u2014 started to their feet to accompany him thither. Although a man of education and of re fined abilities, the evidence that had al ready showed itself to him of the existence at all events of some supernatural being, with powers analogous to those of the fabled vampyre, was such that he could not wholly deny, without stultifying his inteUect, that there might be such things. It is a sad circumstance when the mind is, as it were, compelled to receive unde niable evidence of a something wh'<*h the judgment has the strongest general reasons for disputing, and that was precisely the position of Sir. Bevan, and a most unen viable one it was. That night's proceedings, however, in tbe vault, he felt must put an end to all doubts and perplexity upon the subject, and so with a fervent hope that in some, at present, inexplicable manner, the thing would be found to be a delusion, ha waited most anxiously the arrival of the Croftons at the parsonage. At half-past ten o'clock, instead of eleven, for as the evening advanced, Sir George Crofton had shown such an amount of nervousness, that his sons had thought it would be better to bring him to the parsonage, they arrived, and Mr. Bevan perceived at once what a remarkable effect grief and anxiety had already had upon the features of the baronet. There are many person who waver about an enterprise, who will join it when it ha3 a show of force, and thus was it with this affair. The moment it was found that the blacksmith's proposition had some half dozen stout adherents, he got as many more \u2014 some of whom joined him from curiosity, and some from dread of being thonght to lack courage by their companions if they held off. There was now a sufficiently large party to make a respectable demonstration, and quite elated with his success, and caring little for the loud storm that was raging, the blacksmith, closely followed by the butcher, who had no objection in life to the affair, especially as he was at variance with the parson concerning the tithes of a little farm he kept, he called out \u2014 \"To the church \u2014 to the church !\" and He was a different man to what, but a few days since, he had been, and more than ever the kind clergyman felt inclined to doubt the expediency of his being pre-"], [445, "THE FEAST OF BLOOD. 435 sent on such an occasion, _md yet how to prevent him if he were really determined, was a matter of no small difficulty. \"My dear friend,\" said Mr. Bevan, \" will you pardon me if I make an effort now R> persuade you to abandon this enter prise?\" \"lean pardon the effort easily,\" said Sir George Crofton, \" because I know it is dictated by the best of motives, but I would fain be spared it, for I am determined.\" _ \" I will say no more, btjt only with deep sincerity hope that you may return to your dwelling, each relieved from the load of anxiety that now oppresses you.\" \" I hope to Heaven it may be so.\" \"The night looks strange and still.\" said Charles, who wished to draw his father's attention as much as possible from too close a contemplation of the expedition on which they were bound. \"It does,\" said Edwin; \"I should not be surprised at a storm, for there is every indication of some disturbance of the ele ments.\" know you are all anxious and fearful concerning me, but I have a spirit of reso lution and firmness in this affair which shall yet stand me in good stead. I shall not shrink, as you imagine I shall shrink. Come, then, at once \u2014 it is suspense and delay which frets me, and not action.\" These words enforced a better spirit into both his sons aud Mr. Bevan, and in a few moments the party of four, surely sufficiently strong to overcome any unex pected obstacles, or to defeat any trickery that might [be attempted to be passed off upon them, proceeded towards the church. It will be recollected that it was just a little after that time that the storm com menced, and, in fact, the first clap of thunder, that seemed to shake the heavens, took place just as they reached the old grave-yard adjoining to the sacred build ing. \" There!\" exclaimed Charles, \" I thought that it wonld come.\" \" Whatmatter?\" said Sir George, \"come on.\" \" Let it come,\" said Sir George, who fancied that in all these remarks he detected nothing but a wish to withdraw him from his enterprise; \"let it ceme. I have a duty to perform, and I will do it, though Heaven's thunders should rock the very earth \u2014 the forked Ughtning is not launched at the father who goes to watch at the grave of his child.\" Charles and Edwin, upon finding that Sir George was in the mood to make a misapplication of whatever was said to him, desisted from further remarks, but left Mr. Bevan quietly to converse with him, in a calm and unirritating manner. It was the object of the clergyman to put off as much time as possible before proceeding to tha church, so that the period to be spent in the family vault of the Croftons should be lessened as much as possible, for he felt assured that each minute there wasted would be one of great agony to the bereaved father, who would feel himself once again in such close approximation to that daughter on whom he had placed some of his dearest affec tions. \" Humour him in everything,\" said Mr. Bevan, \" it is madness now to contradict him \u2014 he will not recede under any cir cumstances.\" The natural senses of Sir George Crof ton appeared to be preternaturally acute, for he turned sharply, and said quickly, but not unkindly, \u2014 \" No, he will not recede\u2014 come on.\" After this, nothing was said until they reached the church door, and then while Mr. Bevan was searching in his pockets for the little key which opened the small pri vate entrance, some vivid flashes of light ning lit up with extraordinary brilliancy the old gothic structure\u2014 the neighbouring tombs, and the melancholy yew trees that waved their branches in the night air. Perhaps the delay which ensued before Mr. Bevan could find the key, likewise arose from the wish to keep Sir George as short a time as possible within the vault, but he at length produced it, for any fuither delay could only be accounted for by saying that he had it not. The small arched doorway was speedily cleared, and as another peal of thunder broke over head in awful grandeur of sound, they entered the church. Mr. Bevan took the precaution this time to close the door, so that there could be no interruption from without. \" Now, Sir George,\" he said, \" remem ber your promise. You are to come away freely at the first dawn of day, and if nothing by then has occurred to strengthen the frightful supposition which I suppose I may say we have all indulged iu, I do Sir George, however, defeated this in tention, by promptly rising when his watch told him that ihe hour of eleven had arrived, and it was in vain to attempt to stultify him into a belief that he was wrong as regarded thc time, for the church was sufficiently near for them to hear the hour of eleven pealed forth from its ancient steeple. \"\"Come,\" said Sir George, \" the hour has arrived. I pray you do not delay. I"], [446, "VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE; OR, 436 hope that for ever this subject will be erased from your recollection.\" \"Be it so,\" said Sir George; \" be it so.\" Mr. Bevan then busied himself in light ing a lantern, and from beneath one of the pews, where they were hidden, be procured a couple of crowbars, with which to raise the stone that covered the entrance to the vanlt. covered the vault where lay their sister's remains. The work was not one of great difficulty, for the slab was not very large, and as it was not cemented down, it yielded at once to the powerful leverage that was brought to play against it, and in a few minutes it was placed aside, and the yawning abyss appeared before them. \" Oh, sir,\" said Mr. Bevan, \" even now at this late hour, when the proceedings have commenced, I pray you to pause.\" \"Pause!\" cried Sir George, passion- ately, \" pause for what?\" \"Disturb not the dead, and let them rest in peace. Absolve your mind from the dangerous and perhaps fatal fancies that possess it, and let us say a prayer, and close again this entrance to the tomb.\" The sons hesitated, and they probably would bave taken the clergyman's advice, but Sir George was firm. \"No, sir,\" he said, \"already have I suffered much in coming thus far; I will not retreat until I have effected all my purpose. I swear it, by Heaven, whose temple we now are in. You would not, Mr. Bevan, havo me break such an oath.\" \"1 would not; but I regret you made it. Since, however, it must be so, and this rash adventure is determined upon, follow me; I will lead you the way into these calm regions, where you can sleep, I trust, in peace.\" Sir George Crofton made a step forward, as if he would have arrested Mr. Bevan's progress and led the way himself, but already the clergyman had descended several steps, so he had nothing to do but to follow him. These preparations took up some little time, so that the old clock had chimed the quarter past eleven, and must have been rapidly getting on to the half-hour, before they stood in the aisle close to the vault. \"This marble slab,\" said Sir George, as he cast his eyes upon it, \" always hitherto has been cemented in its place. Why is it not so now?\" \" Is it not?\" said Mr. Bevan. \" No\u2014 lend me the light.\" Mr. Bevan was averse to lending him the light, but he could not very well refuse it; and when Sir George Crofton had looked more minutely at the marble slab, he saw that it had been cemented, but that the cement was torn and broken away, as if some violence bad been used for the purpose of opening tho vault ; but whether that violence came from within or without was a matter of conjecture. CHAPTER CIX. THE HAIIIIA}.. \u2014 THE VAMPTRE. hat does this mean?\" cried Sir George Crofton, exci tedly. \"Hush!\" This they all did, Sir George going im mediately after him, and his two sons, with pale anxious-looking faces, as if they had a suspicion that the adventure would end in something terrific, came after him, and glanced nervously and suspiciously about them; but they said not a word, for if they had spoken, it would have been to express great appreliension, and that was what they were ashamed to do. Mr. Bevan carried the light, and when he felt that he was at the bottom of the stone steps, by finding that he was tread ing upon the sawdust that was strewn on the floor of the vault, he turned and held the lamp up at arm's length, so that bis companions might see their way down the steps. said Mr. Be van, \" I pray you be calm, sir. If you are to make mind, rest assured it will not be made by violence.\" \" You do not answer my question.\" \" I cannot answer it. Remember tbat I know no more than you do, and that, like yourselves, I am an adventurer here in search of the truth.\" Sir George said no more npon that head, but with clasped hands and down cast eyes he stood in silence, while his two sons, armed with the crowbars that Mr. Bevan had provided sor the occasion, pro ceeded to lift up the marble slab that In another minute they aU stood on the floor of the vault. The light burnt with rather a faint and sickly glare, for so rapidly were noxious gases evolved in that receptacle for the"], [447, "THE FEAST OF BLOOD. 437 i dead, that notwithstanding it had been so frequently opened as it had been lately, they had again accumulated. In a few moments, however, this was partially remedied by the air from the church above, and the Ught burnt more brilliantly\u2014 indeed, quite sufficiently so to enable them to look around them in the vault. God\u2014 the agony that a sight of the poor remains of her who has gone from me in all the pride of her youth and beauty must be to me ; yet now that I am here I con sider it to be my duty to look once again upon the face of my child \u2014 my \u2014 my lost Clara.\" \" Oh ! father, father,\" said Edwin, \u25a0 fore go this purpose.\" \"You wiU spare us this,\" cried Charles. \"Repent you, sir,\" said Mr. Bevan, \"of the wish. Let her rest in peace. Tbe dead are sanctified.\" Sir George Crofton's feelings at that moment must have been of the most pain ful and harrowing description. He had lived long enough to be a witness of the death and the obsequies of many members of his family, whom he had loved fondly, and there he stood in that chamber of death, surrounded by all the remains of those beings, the memory of whose appearance and voices came at once freshly upon his mind. \" The dead are sanctified\u2014 but I am her father.\" \" Nay, sir George, let me implore yon.\" \" Implore me to wbat, sir? Not to look npon the face of my own child? Peace \u2014 peace. It is no profanation for one who loved her as I loved her, to look upon her once again. Urge me no more.\" \" It is in vain,\" said Charles. \"You are right\u2014 it is in vain.\" A shriek burst from the lips of Edwin at this moment, and Singing his arms around his father, he held him back. Mr. Bevan, too, gave a cry of terror, and Charles stood with his hands clasped, as if turned to stone. Mr. Bevan could well guess the nature of the sad thoughts that transpired in the breast of the baronet, and the sons having by accident cast their eyes upon the coffin that contained the remains of theu* mother, regarded it in silence, while memory was busy, too, within them in conjuring np her image. \" And it has come to this,\" said Sir George, solemnly. \" We must all come to this,\" interposed Mr. Bevan; \"this is indeed a place sor solemn and holy thoughts\u2014 for self-ex amination, for self-condemnation.\" \" But there is peace here.\" \" There is \u2014 the peace that shall be eternal,\" \"Hark! hark!\" said Charles; \"what is that?\" Their eyes were aU bent upon Clara's coffin. The Ud moved, and a strange sound was heard from within that receptacle for the dead\u2014 the clock of the old church struck twelve \u2014 the coffin Ud moved again, and then sliding on one side, it eventually fell upon the floor of the vault. The fonr spectators of this scene were struck speechless for the time with terror. Then they stood gazing at the coffin as if they were so many statues. And now the Ught which Mr. Bevan still, for a miracle, held in his trembling grasp, shone on a mass of white clothing within tbe coffin, and in another moment tbat white plothing was observed to be in motion*. Slowly the dead form that was there rose np, and they all saw tbe pale and ghastly face. A streak of blood was issuing from tbe mouth, and the eyes were open. .. Sir George Crofton lifted up both his hands, and struck his head, and then he burst into a wUd frightful laugh. It was the laugh of insanity. Mr. Bevan dropped the light, and all was darkness. \" Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!\" laughed Sir George Crofton. \" Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!\" and the horrible laugh was taken up by many an echo in the old church, and responded to with strange and most unearthly rever berations. \" Ha, ba, ba, ba I\" Oh, what a \" The wind,\" said Mr. Bevan; \" nothing but the wind howUng round and through the old belfry \u2014 you will remember tbat it is a boisterous night.\" \" Turn, turn, father.\" Sir George turned and looked at Charle9, who pointed in silence to the coffin which contained the corpse of his mother. The light gleamed upon the place on which was engraved her name. Sir George's feature's moved convulsively as he read it, and be turned aside to hide a sudden gush of emotion that came over him. After a few minutes, he touched Mr. i Bevan on the arm, and said in a whisper \u2014 j \" Where did they place my chUd ?\" The clergyman pointed to the narrow shelf on which was tbe coffin of Clara i Crofton, and then Sir George, making a great effort to overcome bis feelings, said \u2014 \" Mr. Bevan, our worthy minister and friend, and you, likewise, my boys, hear me.

Tho fact i9, that the party from the alehouse, headed by the valiant blacksmith, and heated by their too liberal potations, had just arrived at the church, and were clamouring for admission. They had seen through one of the old painted windows the reflection of the light which Mr. Bevan carried, and that it was that convinced them some one was there who might, if he would, pay attention to the uproarious summons. dreadful sound that was, coming at such a time from the lips of the father. \"Fly Edwin\u2014 oh, fly,\" cried Charles. Edwin screamed twice, for he was full of horror, and then he sell on the floor of the vault in a state of insensibility. Charles had just sense left him to spring towards the steps, and make a frantic effort to reach the church ; in his hurry he fell twice, but each time rising again with a shout of despair he resumed his efforts, and all the while the horrible laugh of his maniac father sounded in his ears, a sound which be felt that he should never forget. By a great effort he did reach the aisle of the church, and when there, be caUed aloud \u2014 \" Mr. Bevan, Mr. Bevan, help\u2014 oh help! For the love of God speak !

Help, help\u2014 oh, help !\" The church was suddenly lit up by a flash of light, and turning in the direction from whence it proceeded, Charles saw Mr. Bevan approaching with a light which he had procuredfrom the chancel, and it would appear that immediately upon dropping in bis horror the light in the vault, he had run up the stairs with the intent of getting an other. \"Who calls me? Who calls me?\" he cried. The knocking lasted with terrible effect, for the old door ofthe sacred edifice shook again, it seemed as if certainly it could not resist the making of such an attack. Mr. Bevan was confounded. A horrible suspicion came across him of what was meant by those violent demands for admis sion, and he shook with great trepidation as be conjectured what might be the effect of the proceedings of a lawless mob. \"Now Heaven help us,\" he said, \"sot we shall soon, I fear, be powerless.\" \"Good God! what mean yon?\" said Charles. \" I scarcely know how to ex. lain to you all my fears. They are too dreadful to ihiiik of, but while that knocking con tinues, what can I think?\" \" I unders'and! they call for my sister.\" \" Oh, cidl her not now by that name.

I hardly think they will venture to break into the sacred edifice, but whether they do or not, remember that your duty and mine, yours being the duty of a son, and mine that of a friend, should take us now to your father's va ilt.\" \" Tlit is true, sir,\" said Charles, \" lead on, I will follow you.\" Mr. Bevan. who bad all the intellectual courage of a man of education, end of regular habits, led the wayagfln tothevaultwith the light in his hand.

The only effect, however, which these sounds had upon Mj. Bevan was to make him hasten his progress towards the vault, for anything in the shape of a collision be tween those (yho wanted to take the church by storm, and Sir George Crofton, was, indeed, most highly to be deprecated. The steps were not many in number, and onie again the clergyman and Charles Crofton stood upon the sawdust that covered the flooring of the vault. At first, in consequence of the flaring of the light, the state of affairs in that dismal region could not be ascertained ; but as soon as they could get a view, they fonnd Sir George lying apparently in a state of insensibility across thc coffin of his daugh ter Clara, while Edwin was in a swoon close to his feet. \" Sir George\u2014 Sir George !\" cried Mr. Bevan ; \" arouse yourself ; it is necessary that you leave this place at once.\" The baronet got up and glanced at the intruders. Charles uttered a deep groan, lor the most superficial observation of his father's face was sufficient to convince him that reason had fled, and that madness had set up bis wild dominion in his brain. \"Father\u2014 father!\" he cried, \"speak to me, and dissipate a frightful thougTit.\" \"What would you have of me?\" said Sir George ; \" I am a vampyre, and this is my tomb \u2014 you should see me in the rays of the cold moon gliding 'twixt earth and heaven, and panting for a victim. I am a vampyre.\" At this moment Edwin seemed to be partially recovering, for his eyes opened as he lay upon the floor, and he looked around him with a bewildered gaze, which soon settled into one of more intelligence as me mory resumed her sway, and he recollected the various circumstances that had brought him into his present position. \"Rouse yourself, Edwin, rouse yourself,\" cried Mr. Bevan, \"you must aid us to re remove your father.\" \u2022 \" Do you talk of me ?\" said Sir George, \" know yon not that I am one of those su pernatural existences known as the death The heavy strokes against the door of the church had ceased, but an odd sort of scraping, rattling sound at the lock, con vinced the clergyman that a workman of more skill than he who bad wielded the hammer was now at work, endeavouring to force an entrance. \" Oh, if we could but get out,\" he said, \" by the small private entrance, all might be well ; Charles, urge your father, I pray you.\" Charles did so to the best of his ability; bnt the blacksmith who had originally in cited the crowd to attack tho church, in order to get possession of thc body of the vampyre, had sent to his workshop sor the tools of hia craft, and soon quietly accom plished by skill, wbat brute force would"], [451, "THE FEAST OF BLOOD. 441 have been a long time about, namely, the opening of the church-door.

That weapon consisted of one of the long iron crowbars which had been successfully used by his own sons in order to force a passage to the family vault, where such horrors had been witnessed. Several of the rioters were provided with links and matches, so that in a few mo ments the whole interior of the church was brilliantly illuminated, while at the same time it presented a grotesque appearance, in consequence of the unsteady and wavering flame from the links, throwing myriads of dancing shadows upon the walls. Suddenly, then, seizing this weapon, which, in the hands of a ferocious man, was a most awful one, he swung it once round his head, and then rushed upon those he considered his foes. There would have been no difficulty, under any ordinary circumstances, in find ing the entrance to the vault, where the dead of the Crofton family should have lain in peace, but now since the large flag stone that covered the entrance to that receptacle of the grave was removed, it met their observation at once. He dealt but three blows, and at each of those one of the assailants fell lifeless in the church-porch. To resist, or to attempt to contend with a man so armed, and apparently possessed of such preternatural strength, was what none of the party wished, and accordingly a free passage was left sor him, and he rushed out of the church into the night air shouting for vengeance, and still at inter- | vais accusing himself of being a vampyre, a most dangerous theme to touch upon, considering tho then state of feeling in that little district. Anxiety for the safety of Sir George in duced his sons and Mr. Bevan to rush after him, regardless of all other conse quences, so that the church, the vaults, and everything they contained, were left to the mercy of a mob iuluriated by superstition, It was strange now to perceive how, sor a moment, superstition having led them on so far, the same feeling should induce them to pause, e:e they ventured to make their way down those gloomy steps. It was a critical moment, and probably if any one or two had taken a sudden panic, the whole party might have left the church with precipitation, having done a con siderable amount of mischief, and yet, as it is so usual with rioters, having left their principal object unaccomplished. The blacksmith put an end to this state of indecision, for, seizing a link from tbe man who was nearest to him, he daited"], [452, "VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE ; OR, 442 i SI porch, and there waited until its first fury had passed away. Such an even down storm seldom lasts long in our climate, and thc consequence was that in about ten minutes the shower had so far subsided that, although a con tinuous rain was falling, it bore but a very distant comparison to what had taken place. \" How are we to burn the body on such a night as this?'' \"Ay, how, indeed,\" said another; \"you could not so much as kindle a fire, and if you did, it would not live many minutes.\" \" I'll tell you what to do at once,\" said one who had as yet borne but a quiet part in the proceedings ; \"I'll tell you what to do at once, for I saw it done myself ; a vampyre is quite as secure buried in a cross-road wiih a stake through its body, as if you burned it in all tbe fires in the world ; come on, the rain won't hinder you doing that.\" This was a suggestion highly approved of, and the more so as there was a cross road close at hand, so thrit the 'Iced could be done quick, and the panics dispersed to their respective homes, for already the exertion they had taken, and tbe rain that had fallen, had had a great effect in sobering them.

I saw it at Grigson's the undertaker's before it was taken tc the Grange.'' \"Is she there\u2014 is she there?\" cried half a-dozen voices at once. Even the blacksmith hesitated a mo ment ere he removed the lid from the receptacle of death, but when he did so, and his eyes seU upon the face of tbe pre sumed vampyre, he seemed rejoiced to find in the appearances then exhibited some sort of justification for the act of violence of which already he bad been tbe insti gator. \" Here you are,\" he said, \" look at the bloom upon her lips ; why her cheeks are fresher and rosier than ever they were while she was alive ; a vampyre, my mates, this is a vampyre, or may I never break bread again ; and now what's to be done?\" \" Burn her \u2014 burn her I\" cried several. \"Well,\" said the blacksmith, \"mind it's as you like. I've brought you here, and shown you what it is, and now you can do what you like, and of course I'll lend you a hand to do it\" Any one who had been very speculative in this affair might have detected in these last words of the blacksmith something like an inclination to creep out of the future consequences of what might next be done, while at the same time shame deterred him from exactly leaving his companions in the lurch. After some suggestions then, and some argumentation as to the probability or possibility of interruption\u2014 the coffin itself was, with its sad and wretched occupant, listed from the niche where it should have remained until that awful day when the dead shall rise for judgment, and carried up the steps into the church ; from thence they passed into the graveyard, but scarcely had they done so, when tho surcharged clouds burst over their heads, and tho rain came down in perfect torrents. The delnge was of so frightful and con tinuous a character, that they shrank back again beneath the shelter of the church Once more tho coffin was raised by four of the throng, and carried through the church-yard, which was now running in many little rivulets, in consequence of the rain. The cross-road was not above a quarter ofa mile from the spot, and while those who were disengaged from carrying the body were hurrying away to get spades and mattocks, the others walked through the rain, and finally paused at the place they thought suitable for that ancient superstitious rite, which it was thought would make the vampyre rest in peace. It is hard to suppose that Sir George Crolton, his sons, and Mr. Bevan were all deceived concerning these symptoms of vitality which they had observed in the corpse of Clara; but certainly now, there was no appearance of anything of the kind, and the only suspicious circum stances appeared to be the blood upon the lips, and the very fresh-like appearance of the face. If it were really a fact that the attack of Varney the Vampyre upon this fair young"], [453, "THE FEAST OK LLUOi). 443 girl had converted her into one of those frightful existences, and that she had been about to leave her tomb for the purpose of seeking a repast of blood, it would appear that the intention had been checked and frustrated by the presence of Sir George and his party in the vault. At least a dozen men now arrived well armed with spades and picks, and they commenced the work of digging a deep, rather than a capacious grave in silence. A gloomy and apprehensive spirit seemed to come over the whole assemblage, and the probability is that this was chiefly owing to the fact that they now encountered no opposition, and that they were permitted unimpeded to accomplish a purpose which bad never yet been attempted within the memory of any of the inhabitants of the place. The grave was dug, and about two feet depth of soil was thrown in a huge mound upon the surface ; the coffin was lowered, and there lay the corpse within that recep tacle of poor humanity, unimprisoned by any lid, for that had been left in the vault, and awaiting the doom which they had decreed upon it, but which they now with a shuddering horror shrunk from perform ing. A hedge-stake with a sharp point had been procured, and those who held it looked arouod them with terrified coun tenances, while the few links that had not been extinguished by the rain shed a Strange and lurid glare upon all objects. \" It must be done,\" said the blacksmith, \" don't let it be said that we got thus far and then were afraid.\" \" Stand aside yourself \u2014 do you want to fall into the grave?\" The blacksmith shuddered as he held the stake in an attitude to pierce the body, and even up to that moment it seemed to be a doubtful case whether he would bo able to accomplish his purpose or not ; at length, when they all thought he was upon the point of abandoning his design, and casting the stake away, he thrust it with tremendous force through the body and tbe back of the coffin. The eyes of the corpse opened wide \u2014 the hands were clenched, and a shrill, pierc ing shriek came from the lips \u2014 a shriek that was answered by as many as there were persons present, and then with pallid fear upon their countenances they rushed headlong from the spot. CHAPIER CXII. THE SOLITARY MAN.\u2014 VAENEY'S DESPAIR. HERE lay the dead, alone, in that awful grave, dabbled in blood, and the victim of the horrible experiment that had been instituted to lay a vampyre. The rain stiU fell hea- \" Doit then yourself,1' said the man that held the stake, \" I dare not.\" \" Ay, do,\" cried several voices ; \" you brought us here, why don't you do it \u2014 are you afraid after all your boasting?\" \"Afraid \u2014 afraid of she dead? I'm not afraid of any of you that are alive, and it's not likely I'm going to be afraid of a dead body ; you're a pretty set of cowards. I've no animosity against tbe girl, but I want that we shall all sleep in peace, and that our wives and children should not be disturbed nocturnaily in their blessed repose. I'll do it if none of you'll do it, and then you may thank me afterwards for the act, although I suppose if I get into trouble I shall have you all turn tail upon me.\" \"No, we won't\u2014 no, we won't.\" vily. Ob, surely, pitying Heaven sent those drops to wash out the remembrance of such a deed. The grave slowly began to be a pool of water ; it rose up the sides of the coffin, and in a few minutes more nothing of the ghastly and the terrible contents of that grave could have been seen. Beiore that took place, a man of tall stature and solemn gait stepped up and stood upon the brink of the little exca vation. Por a time he was as still as that sad occupant of the little space of earth that served her for a resting place ; but at length in a tone of deep anguish, he spoke \u2014 \"And has it come to this?\" he said; \"is this my work? Oh, horror ! horror, un speakable. Is this some hideous dream, or a reality of tragedy, so far transcend ing all I looked for, that if I had tears I should shed them now? But I have none. A hundred years ago that fount way dry. \" Well, well, here goes, whether you do or not. I \u2014 I'll do it directly.\" \" He shrinks,\" cried one. \"No,\" said another ; \"he'll do it\u2014 now for it, stand aside.\""], [454, "VARNEY, TnE VAMPYRE; OR, 444 I thought that I had steeled my heart against all gentle impulses ; that I had crushed\u2014 ay, completely crushed dove eyed pity in my heart ; but it is not so, and still sufficient ot my once human feel ings clings to me to make me grieve sor thee, Clara Crofton, thou victim !\" We need not tell our readers now, that it was no other than Varney the vampyre himself from whom these words came. he who was rescued from the sea by the two sons of Sir George Crofton?\" \"Well?\" \" Now I know you, and I am glad to have met with you.\" \"You will try to kill me?\" \" No, no, peace is my profession.\" \" Ah ! you are the priest of this place. Well, sir, what would you with me ?\" \" I would implore you to tell me if it be really true that \u2014 that \" Mr. Bevan paused, sor he disliked to show that the fear that it might be irue there were such creatures as vampyres had taken so strong a hold of him. \"Proceed,\" said Varney. \"I will. Are you then a vampyre?\" inquired Mr. Bevan. \"A strange question sor one living man to put to another. Are you?\" \" You are inclined to trifle wilh me. But I implore you to answer me. I am, perhaps, the only man in all this neighbourhood to whom you can give an answer in thc affir mative with safety.\" \" And why, sir?\" \" Because I question not the decrees of Heaven. If it seems fit to the Great Ruler of Heaven and of earth, that there should be ever such horrible creatures as vam pyres, ought I, his creature, to question it?\" After thus, then, giving such fervent utterance to the sad feelings that had overcome him, he stood for a time silent, and then glancing around him as well as he could by the dim light, he found the spades, by the aid of which the grave had been dug, and which the men had in their general flight left behind them. Seizing one, he commenced, with an energy and perseverance that was well adapted to accomplish the object, to fill up the grave. \"You shall now rest in peace,\" he said. In the course of about ten minutes the grave was levelled completely, so that there were no signs or indications of any one having been there interred. The rain was still falling, and notwith. standing that circumstance, he continued at his work, until he bad stamped down the earth to a perfect level ; and then, even as if he were still further anxious to thoroughly destroy any indication of the deed that had been done, he took the loose earth that was superfluous, and scattered it about. \"You ought not \u2014 you ought not. I have heard much from priests, but from your lips I hear sound reason. I am a vampyre.\" Mr. Bevan shrunk back, and shook for a moment, as he said in a low, faltering tone \u2014 \"This done,\" he said, \" surely you will now know peace.\" He cast down the spade with which he had been worsing, and lingered tor a few brief moments. Suddenly he started, for he heard, or thought he heard, an ap proaching footstep. His first impulse appeared to be to fly, but that he soon corrected, and folding his arms solemnly across his breast, he waited for the man that was now evidently making speed towards that spot. In a few moments more he saw the dusky outline of the figure, and then Mr. Bevan, the clergyman, stood before i.i Mr. Bevan did not at the moment recog nise in the sorm before him the man who had been the gDest of Sir George Crofton, and from whom it was supposed had : all the mischief and horror that had upon the family at the Grange. \" For how long \u2014 have you \u2014 \" \"You would know how long I have endured such a state of existence.

Perhaps you have at times fancied you have suffered some great amount of mental agony. Per haps you have stood by the bed-side of dying creatures and heard them howl their hopelessness of Heaven's mercy, but you cannot know what I have suffered.\" As he spoke he turned away, but Mr. Bevan followed him, saying \u2014 \" Remain \u2014 remain, I implore yon.\" \" Remain \u2014 and wherefore?\" me, you trust one who is not in the habit of condemning his fellc-rs. Yon will be safe from anything Uke sanctified reproach, for to my thinking, religion should be a prin ciple of love and tenderness, and not a sub ject upon which people, who, perhaps, are themselves liable and obnoxious to all sorts of reproach, should deal forth denuncia tions against their neighbours.\" \" Is that, indeed, your faith ?\" \" It is; and it is the real faith, taught by my Great Master.\" \"You are as one among many thou sands.\" \" Nay, you may have been unfortunate in meeting with bad specimens of those who are devoted to the priesthood.

If you will not pray yourself to Heaven, I will pray for you, and in time to come you will have some hope. Ob, believe me, earnest prayer is not in vain.\" \"My friend?\" \"Yes, your friend; I am, I ought to be the friend of all who are unhappy.\" \" And is there really one human being who does not turn from me in horror and disgust? Qh, sir, you jest!\" \"No\u2014 on my soul, that which I say I mean. Come with me now, and you shall, if you please, remain in secret in my house \u2014 no one shall know you are with me \u2014 from the moment that you cross the thres hold you shall hope for happier days.\" The vampyre paused, and it was evident that he was deeply affected by what Mr. Bevan said to him, for his whole frame shook. \" I will for once again put faith in human nature.\" \" Tell me, then, before we leave this spot, if you know aught of what has happened to or become of tbe body of Clara Crofton.\" \" I can tell you; it was left here buried, but uncovered.\" \" Indeed\u2014 the ground is level, and I see no trace of a grave.\" \" No, I have obliterated all such traces. I have placed the earth upon her \u2014 may she now rest in peace. Oh, that such a flower should have been so rudely plucked, and I the cause. Is not that enough to make Heaven's angels mutiny if I should essay to pass tbe golden gates?\" \" Say no more of that. I thank God that the body is so disposed of, and that it will not come in the way of any of the Crofton family.

He only sits and smiles to himself, weaving in his imagination strange fancies.\" \"And call you that unhappy?\" said Varney. \" It is called, and considered so.\" \"Ob, fatal error\u2014 he is happy. Reason! boasted, God-like reason\u2014 what are you but the curse of poor humanity? The maniac, who will, in his cell, fancy it a gorgeous hall, and of the damp straw that is his couch make up a glitterinr coronet, is a king indeed, and most happy.\" \"This is poetical,\" said Mr. Bevan, \"it not true.\" \" It is true.\" \"Well, well; we wiU talk on that as well as other themes at our leisure.

Bevan could not but see that he had made an impression, even upon the obdurate heart of Varney, and he was deter- mined to fol- low that im pression up by every means in his power. \"Always have in mind,\" he said, \" tbat by trusting"], [456, "VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE. 446 where you will be safe, and I hope more happy.\" \"Are you not afraid?\" \" I am not.\" \"You are right; confidence is safety \u2014 lead on, sir, I'll follow you, although I little thought to make any human com- panionship to-night.\" Mr. Bevan walked only about a step in advance as they proceeded towards the parsonage house, and on she way he con- versed with Varney with a calmness which, considering the very peculiar circumstances, few men could have brought to bear upon the occasion. But Mr. Bevan was no common man. He looked upon nature, and all the living creatures that make up its vital portion, with peculiar eye9, and if the bishop of.his diocese had known one half of what Mr. Bevan thought, he would not have suffered him to remain in his religious situation. But he kept the mass of his liberal opinions to himself, although he always acted upon them, and a man more com- pletely free from sectarian dogmas, and illiberal fancies of superstition, which are nicknamed faith, could not be. There was still, notwithstanding all the circumstances, a hope lingering in his mind that Varney might after all not be even what he thought himself to be, but some enthusiast who had dreamt himself into a belief of his own horrible powers. We know that such was not the case. But it was natural enough for Mr. Bevan to hold as long as he could by such an idea. And so those two most strangely assorted beings, the clergyman and the vampvre, walked together towards the pretty and picturesque dwelling of the former. \" The distance is short,\" said Mr. Bev an. \"Nay, that matters not,\" replied Var- ney. \" I spoke because I thought you seer oed fatigued.\" \" No, my frame is of iron. My heai t. is bowed down with many griefs, but I he physical structure knows no feeling of (re- jection. The life I possess is no comm on one. Oh I would that it were so, that I might shuffle it off as any ordinary m en can do.\" \"Do not say that. Who knows but th at after all your living accomplishes bett er things ?\" . \" I cannot say that it accomplishes auc ht completely but one thing \" \"And that?\" \"That is my most exquisite misery.\" 'Even that may pass away. But here we are at my little garden gate. Come in. and fear nothing; sor if yoa will seek Heaven as I would wish you, you will rind this place such a haven of peace, and such a refuge against the storms of life, as you hardly fancied existed, I dare say, in this world.\" \" Not sor me. I did not fancy that there existed a spot on eurth on which I could lie down in peace; and yet it may be here.\" CHAPTER CXIV. VARNEY- OPENS THE VAST STORE-HOUSE OF HIS MEMORY. I more singular conversation than thatwhich took place be- tween Varney, the Vampyre, and this minis- ter of religion, could not he conceived. If there was any one particle of goodness exist ing in Varney's disposition, we may st ppose it would now be developed. Perhaps the whole domestic history of the world never yet exhibited so remark- able an association as that between Mr. Bevan and Varney ; and when they sat down together in the little cheerful study of the former, never had tour walls en- closetl two beings of the same species, and yet of such opposite pursuits. But we can hardly call Varney, the Vampyre, human \u2014 his space of existence had been lengthened out beyond the ordi- nary routine of human existence, and the kind of vitality that he now enjoyed, if one might be allowed the expression, was some- thing distinct and peculiar. It speaks volumes, however, for the philanthropy and liberality of the minister of any religion who could hold out the hand of fellowship to so revolting and to so horrible an existence. But Mr. Bevan was no common man. His religion was doctrinal, certainly, but it was free from bigotry; and his charity to the feelings, opinions, and prejudices of others was immense. He was accustomed to say \" may not my feelings be prejudices?\" and one of the sublimest precepts of the whole scriptures was to him that which says, \" Judge not, lest ye, too, should be judged.\" Hence it was that he would not allow"], [457, "VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE ; OR, THE FEAST OF BLOOD. 449 himself to revolt at Varney. It had seemed right to the great Creator of all things that there should be such a being, and, there fore, he, Mr. Bevan, would neither question nor contemn it. \"Why do you look about you with a disordered gaze?\" he said to Varney. \" You seem to look about yon as if there were danger in the very atmosphere you breathe, but be assured you are safe here ; it shall be my life for yonr life if any harm should be attempted to be done you.\" Varney looked at him for a few moments in silence, and then in his deep and sepul chral voice he spoke, saying \u2014 \" My race is run.\" THE DESPAIR Ot THE CROFTON FAMILY. \" Perhaps not an accident,\" said Mr. Bevan. \" You may be right ; but when 1 have sought to rid the world of my own bad company, I have been moved to do so by some act of kindness and consideration, most contrary to my deserts; and then again when I have been cast back by the I \" What mean you by that expression?\" \" I mean, I shall no longer be a terror to the weak, nor a curiosity lo thr) strong. In time past, more than once I have tried to shuffle off the evil of this frightful exist- ence, but some accident, strange, wild, and wonderful, has brought me back to Use again.\" \u25a0 No. 57.;"], [458, "VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE; OR, 448 waves of fate npon the shores of existence, my heart is hardened, and I have begun to plan to work mischief and misery and woe to all.\" \" I can understand how your feelings have alternated ; but I hope that our asso ciation wUl have a better result.\" in his little garden, he thought, that by now and then peeping in, to see that all was right, he could scarcely be considered as breaking faith with his mysterious guest. \" He will surely attempt nothing against his own life,\" thought Mr. Bevan, \" for already he seems to be impressed with the futility of sucb an attempt, and to think that when he has made them he has been mado tbe sport of circumstances that has forced him back to life again, despite all his wishes to the contrary.\" Mr. Bevan reasoned thus, but he little knew what was passing in the mind of Varney the Vampyre. After about two hours more, when the night was profoundly dark, the liberal minded, but anxious clergyman went into his garden, for the purpose of peeping into his study, and he then saw, as he sup posed, his visitor lying enveloped in his large brown cloak, lying upon the couch. He was better pleased to see he was sleeping, and recovering from the great fatigue of which he complained, instead of writing, although that writing promised to be of so interesting a character, aud he crept softly away for fear of awakening him. \" Yes, a better result, for with consum mate art, with cool perseverance and ex tended knowledge, I trust I may think of some means which cannot fail of changing this living frame to that dust from which it sprung, and to which it should long since have returned.\" \" You believe in that, but do you not think there is a pure spirit that will yet Uve, independent of the groveUing earth?\" \" There are times when I have hoped that even that fable were true ; but you have promised me rest, will you keep your word?\" \u2022 That will I most certainly ; but will you keep yours? You have promised me some details of your extraordinary exist ence, and as a divine, and I hope in some degree as a philosopher, I look sor them with some degree of anxiety.\" \" You shall have them \u2014 leave me pens, ink, and paper, and the solitude of this room, until to-morrow morning, and you shall have what I bebeve to be the origin of this most horrible career.\" The hour had now arrived at which Mr. Bevan usually retired to rest, but he delayed doing eo, and let two hours more elapse, after which, he again stole out to his garden, and peeped into the study. There lay the long, gaunt, slumbering figure upon the couch. \"lam satisfied,\" said Mr. Bevan, to himself ; \" fatigue has completely over come him, and he will sleep till -Worning now. I long much to become acquainted with his strange eventful history.\" After this, Mr. Bevan retired to rest, but not until in prayer he had offered up his thanks, and stated his hopes of being able to turn aside from the wicked path he had beeen pursuing, the wretched man who at that moment w.rs slumbering peacefully beneath his roof. \"Your wishes shall be consulted \u2014 but will you not take refreshment?\" \" Nothing \u2014 nothing. My refreshment is one I need not name to you, and when forced by the world's customs and consi derations of my own safety, I have par taken of man's usual food, it has but ill accorded with my preternatural existence. I eat not \u2014 drink not \u2014 here. You know me as I am.\" As he continued speaking, Varney evi dently grew weaker, and Mr. Bevan could scarcely persuade himself that it was not through actual want of nourishment, but the vampyre assured him that it was not so, ani that rest would recruit him, to which opinion, as the experience of human na ture generally afforded no index to Var ney's peculiar habits, he was forced to subscribe. There was a couch in the room, and upon that Varney laid himself, and as he seemed indisposed for further conversation, Mr. Bevan left him, promising to return to him, with the hope of finding that he had completed some sort of narrative to the effect mentioned. It can scarcely be said that Mr. Bevan had thoroughly made up his mind to leave his guest for so long a period, and as there was a window that looked from the study We should have less of opposition to churchmen, if they were all like Mr. Bevan, and not the wily, ravenous, illiberal grasp ing crew they really are. There was no priestcraft in him ; he was almost enough to make one i > love with his doctrines, be they what they might, so that they were bis. Although we say that he retired to rest, we should more properly say he retired to try to rest ; for, after all, there were feel ings of excitement and anxiety about him which he could not repress wholly ; and although he had every reason to believe"], [459, "THE FEAST OF BLOOD. 449 bis guest was sleeping, and calmly sleeping too, yet he found he was becoming pain fully alive to the slightest sound. He became nervously alive to the least interruption, and kept fancying that he heard the slightest indications of move ments in the house, such as at any other time he would have paid no attention to. It always happened, too, provokingly, that just as he was dropping into a slight slumber, that he thought he heard one of these noises, and then he would start, awake, and sit up in his bed, and listen attentively, until tired nature forced him to repose again. Those who have passed such a night of watchfulness need not be told how very, very exciting it becomes, and hour after hour becomes more intense and acute, and the power of escaping its fell influence less and less. again had it not been that his servant again opened the door, the lock of which had the infirmity of giving a peculiar snap every time it was used, and that thoroughly awakened him. \" Oh, you are awake, sir,\" said his old servant ; \" I never knew you sleep so long. Breakfast has been ready an hour and a half. It's a cool morning, sir, and what's worse, I can't get into your study to Ught you a bit of fire, which I thought you would want.\" The interruption altogether, and the mention of the study, served completely to arouse Mr. Bevan to a remembrance of the events of the preceding evening, and he cried \u2014 \" What's the time? What's tho time?\" \" It's alter nine; and as for the study \u2014 \" \"Never mind the study \u2014 never mind the study, I will be down directly.\" Scarcely ever had Mr. Bevan dressed himself with such precipitation as he now did. Indeed, it was uot until the dawn of morning that Mr. Bevan tasted the sweets of sound repose; then, a3 is generally usual after nights of fever and disquietude, the cool, pure, life-giving air of early morn produced quite a different state of feeling, aud his repose was calm and serene. \" How provoking,\" he thought, \" that upon this partico lar occasion, when I should like to have been up and stirring earlier than usual, I am a good hour and a half later. It can't be helped though, and if my guest of last night is to be credited, he won't be waiting for his breakfast.\" The simple toilet of the kind-hearted clergyman was soon completed, and then he ran down stairs to the lower part of his house, and finding that his servant was in the kitchen, he thought he might at once proceed to his study, to speak to the extra ordinary inmate. He had furnished Varney with the means of locking himself in for the night, and it would seem that the vampyre had fully availed himself of those means, for when Mr. Bevan tried the door, he sound himself as much at fault as his servant had been and could not by any means effect an ad mittance. CHAPTER CXV. THE FLIGHT OF THE VAMPTRE. \u2014 THE MSS. s was to be ex- pected, in con- sequenceofthe sleepless state in which he had been in the early part of the night, Mr. j Bevan did not \\ awaken at bis | usually early hour ; and as his confiden- \"He said his fatigue was great,\" re marked Mr. Bevan, \"and so it seems it was, for surely he is yet sleeping. It is a comfort when one oversleeps oneself that the necessity for one's rising has been put off by the same means.\" Unwilling to disturb Varney, and not hearing from the slightest movement from within that he bad yet done so, Mr. Bevan went to his breakfast, much better satisfied than he had been a quarter of an hour since, and as the breakfast-room adjoined the study, he had every opportunity, if the vampyre should be stirring, of hearing and attending to him. Not above ten minutes elapsed in this kind of way, when Mr. Bevan, although he tial servant had stolen into his room upon tip-toe, and seeing that he was sleeping quietly and soundly, she did not think proper to disturb him. An autumnal sun was gleaming into his lattice window when he spontaneously awoke, and the reflection of the sunlight upon a particular portion of the wall con vinced him that it was late. For a moment or two he lay in that dreamy state when we are just conscious of where we are, without having the smallest pretensions to another idea;and probably he would have dropped to sleep"], [460, "VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE; OR, 450 saw nothing of his guest, heard something of tbe approach of a visitor by the trampling of feet upon the gravel walk, and upon looking through the window, he saw that it was his friend Sir George Crofton from the hall. which time will heal, griefs which the more we look upon them the more we find onr reason array itself against them. But his sorrows were of a different complexion, and were apt to grow more gigantic from thonght. \" Good morning, Mr. Bevan,\" he said, \" I am an early visitor, sir.\" \"Not more early than welcome, Sir George. I pray you to be seated.\" \" You are very good,\" said the baronet, \" but wheii one comes at an hour like this. I am of opinion that he ought to come with something like a good excuse for his intrusion.\" It was rather an early hour for visitors, but still, under the peculiar circumstances, Sir George might be supposed not to stand upon ceremony in calling upou the clergy man of his parish, and upon his old friend, combining, as Mr. Bevan did, both these characters in one. It was rather, though, placing the clergy man in a situation of difficulty, for while there was nothing he so much hated as mystery and concealment, he yet could not, upon the spur of the moment, decide whether he ought to inform Sir George of the presence of Varney or not. After the frightful manner in which the baronet and his family had suffered from what might be called the machinations ol the vampyre, it could scarcely be supposed that his feelings were otherwise than in a most exasperated state, and it might, for all he knew, be actually dangerous for the personal safety of that guest whom he had pledged his honour to protect, to allow Sir Geurge Crofton to know at all that he was beneath his roof. \"There is none needed, I assure you.\" \"But I have been thinking upon the advice which you have given me, Mr. Bevan, to leave this part of the country, and try the endeavour, by the excitement and changes of foreign travel, to lessen the weight of my calamities.\" \"I think your determination is a good one, Sir George.\" \"Probably it is the best I could adopt, but I must confess that I should set abjut it in better spirit, but I am haunted by ap prehensions.\" \"Apprehensions, Sir George? Is not the worst passed?\" \" It may be, and I hope to Heaven it is, but I have another child, another daughter, fair and beautiful as my lost Clara; but what security have I that that dreadful being may not pursue her, and with frightful vindictiveness drive her to the grave?\" Mr. Bevan was silent two or three minutes, and the idea crossed him that if he could get Sir George in the proper state of mind, it would be, perhaps, better that he should know that the vampyre was in the house, and in such a state of mind as not to renew any outrages agaiust him or his family, than that he should go abroad with the dread clinging to him of being still followed and persecuted by that dreadful being. \" Sir George,\" said Mr. Bevan, in an extremely serious voice, \"Sir George, did you ever reason with yourself calmly and seriously, and in a Christian spirit, about this affair?\" While he wasengaged in these consider ations, and beforo he could come to any thing iike a conclusion concerning them, Sir George was announced, and shown as a privileged visitor into the parlour. We cannot but pause to make a remark upon the stupendous change that had taken place in the appearance of that un happy man. When first we presented him to the reader, he was as good a specimen ot the hale hearty English gentleman as we could wish to see; good humour and good health beamed forth on every feature of his face; and well they might do so, for although the past had not been unchequered by trials, the future wore to him a sunny aspect, aud some of the feelings of his youth were returning to him in the happi ness of his children. But what a change was now. Twenty years of ordinary existence, with extraor dinary vicissitudes, would scarcely have pro duced the effect tbe events of the last fort night had had upon the unhappy father. He appeared to be absolutely sinking into the grave with grief, and not only was his countenance strangely altered, but the tones of his voice were completely changed from what they had been. Alas ! poor Sir George Crofton; never will the light of joy again illumine your face. There are griefs, inevitable griefs, \" Calmly, Mr. Bevan! how could I rea son calmly?\" \" I have scarcely put my question as I ought; what I meant to ask was, what are your personal feelings towards the vam pyre? We must recollect that even he, dreadful existence as he is, was fashioned by the same God that fashioned U9; and who shall say but he may be the victim of a horrible and stern nectssity? Who shaU"], [461, "THE FEAST OF BLOOD. 451 say but he may be tortured by a remorse, and the circumstances connected with your daughter, of which you so justly complain, may he to him sources of the bitterest reflectiou? What if you were to be assured that never more would that mysterious man cress your path, if man we can call him? Do you think that you could then forgive him?\" \" It is hard to say, but the feeling that my other child was safe would prompt me much.\" \"WUl that regret,\" said Sir George, excitedly, \" restore the dead? Will that regret give me my child again? Will it open the portals of the grave, and restore her to me who was the Use and joy of my existence? Tell me, will it do that? If not, what is bis regret to me?\" \" No, Sir George \u2014 no, his regret will not do that. There is such power, but it is not upon earth. Heaven delegates not such fearful responsibilities to any of its creatures, and the only reason which has induced me to make this confidence was to take from you the fearful anxiety of fancying yourself foUowed by that dread- ful being.\" \" Vengeance,\" replied Sir George Crof- ton, \" vengeance shall be mine. In the name of my lost child I cry for vengeance. Shall he not perish who has made her whom I love perish? Make way, Mr. Bevan, make way.\" \" No, Sir George, no, this is my house. I, as a christian minister, offered the hos- pitality of its roof to Varney the Vampyre, and I cannot violate my word.\" \"You speak, sir, to a desperate man,'* cried Sir George, \" no roof to me is sanc- tified, beneath which the murderer of my child finds a shelter. Mr. Bevan, the re- spect that one man has ser another, or ever has had sor another, cannot exceed the respect I have for you; but with all that, sir, I cannot forget my own personal wrongs; the shade of my murdered Clara beckons me.\" \"Sir George, I could make a communi ' cation to you if I thought you would listen to it patiently; if you will swear to mo to be calm.'' \" I swear; tell me\u2014 ob, tell me !\" \" The vampyre is in this house.\" CHAPTER CXVI. THE MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCE. ne may form some some sort of judg- ment of the utter a stonishme nt with which Sir George Crofton heard this state- ment. He looked indeed a few mo- ments at Mr. Be- van, as if be had a strong suspi cion that he could not possibly have heard aright, so that the good clergyman was induced to repeat his statement, which he did, by saying \u2014 \" Sir George, I assure you, however re markable such a circumstance may be, and however much you may feel yourself sur prised at it, that in the extreme bitterness of spirit, and feeling all the compunction that you could possibly wish him to feel, Varney the Vampyre is now an inmate of this house.\" \" Ply, Varney\u2014 fly,\" cried Mr. Bevan, \"fly!\" \" Is it so?\" caid Sir George ; \" do you then side with my direst foe?\" \" No\u2014 no, I side with Sir George Crof- ton against bis own furious, unbridled passions.\" Neither from profession nor ' practice was Mr. Bevan one who was likely by force to resist Sir George, and at the mo- ment the baronet was about to lay hands upon him to hurl him from his path, he slipped aside. \"Rash man,\" he said \"the time will most assuredly come when you wUl repent this deed.\" The door of tbe study was still fast, but to the infuriated Sir George, that opposed but a very frail obstacle, and with the effort of a moment he forced it open, and rushed into the apartment. \" Varney, monster,\" he cried, \" prepare to meet your doom. Your career is at an end.\" Had a bomb-shell fallen at his feet, Sir George Crofton could not have felt more surprised, and he exhibited that surprise by several times repeating to himself \u2014 \" Varney the Vampyre an inmate of this house! Varney the Vampyre here!\" \" Yes,\" said Mr. Bevan, \" here, an in mate of this house. He is within a few paces of you, slumbering in the next apartment, and from his own lips you shall have the assurance that never again will you have any trouble on bis account, and that he most bitterly and most deeply regrets the suffering he bas brought upon you and yours.\" Mr. Bevan was after him, and in the room with him in a moment, fully expect ing that some very dreadful scene would"], [462, "VARNEY, THE VAMP i UK; OR, 452 ensne, as a consequence of the unbridled passion of Sir George Crofton. Sir George Crofton was standing in the centre of the apartment with V large brown cloak in bis grasp, which he had dragged from the sofa, ;; pyre himself was not to bo seen. \" Escaped!\" he cried, \" escaped !\" \" Thank Heaven, then,\" said Mr. Bevan, \" that this roof has not been desecrated by an act of violence. Oh, Sir George, it is a mercy that time has been given to think he has escaped.\" \" I'll follow him, were it to perdition.\" Sir George was about to open the win- dow and rnsh into the garden, thinking, of course, it was by that means by which the vampyre escaped, but Mr. Bevan laid his hand upon him, and pointed to the smooth gravel path that was immediately below tbe casement. would be prudent to trust Sir George at that time with its contents. As may be well supposed, there was a sort of restraint in the manner of both of them after what had happened, and they did what was very rare with them both, parted without making any appointment for the suture. But whatever might be the feelings of Sir George Crofton then, a little reflection would be quite sure to bring him back again to a proper estimation of what was due to such a friend as Mr. Bevan, and w'e cannot anticipate any serious interruption to their general friendly intercourse. The moment the clergyman sound him self alone, be with eager steps went into his study, and eagerly seized upon the packet that was left to him by the vampyre, the outside of which merely bore the su perscription of\u2014\" These to the Rev. Mr. Bevan, and strictly private.\" With eagerness he tore open the enve lope, and the first thing that attracted his attention, was a long, narrow slip of paper, on which were written the following words \u2014 \" Behold,\" he said, \" one of the first re- sults of an autumnal night. That thin coating of fleecy sleet, you see, is undis- turbed; it fell about midnight; nine hours have since elapsed, and you perceive there is no footmark upon it, and in what direc- tion would you chase Varney the Vampyre while he has such a start of you?\" Infuriated with passion as was Sir George Crofton, the reasonableness of this statement struck him forcibly, and he be- came silent. A revulsion of feeling took place; he staggered to a seat, and wept. \" Yes, he is gone,\" he said. \" Yes, the murderer of my child is gone; vengeance is delayed, but perhaps not altogether stopped. Ob, Mr. Bevan\u2014 Mr. Bevan, why did you tell me he was here?\" \" I do now regret having done so, but I believed bim to be here, and his departure is as mysterious to me as it can be to you.\" Mr. Bevan cast his eyes upon the table, and there he saw a large packet addressed to himself. Sir George saw it, too, at the same moment, aud pointing to it, said \u2014 \" Is that the vampyre's legacy to his new friend?\" \"It was not my intention to trespass largely upon your hospitality ; it would have been nnjust \u2014 almost approaching to criminality so to do. I could only think of taking a brief refuge in your bouse, so brief as should just enable me to avail my self of tbe shadows of night to escape from a neighbourhood where I knew I should be hunted. \" The few hours which I have quietly remained beneath your roof have been suf ficient to accomplish that object, and tho papers that I leave you accompanying this, contain the personal information con cerning me you asked. They had been previously prepared, and are at your ser vice. \" To attempt to follow me would be fu tile, for I have as ample means of making a rapid journey as you could possibly call to your aid, and I have the advantage of many hours' start ; under these circum stances I have no hesitation in telling you that my destination is Naples, and that, perhaps, the next you hear of me will be, that some stranger in a fit of madness has cast himself into the crater of a burning mountain, which would at once consume him and all his sorrows. \" Sir George,\" said Mr. Bevan, \" let it suffice that the packet is addressed to me.\" All the good breeding of the gentleman returned, and Sir George Crofton bowed as he left the room, closely followed by the clergyman, who was as much bewildered by the disappearance of Varney as even Sir George could possibly be. He had a most intense desire to examine the packet with the hope that there he should find some explanation or solution of the mys tery; but not being aware, of course, of what it contained, be could not teU if it \"Varney the Vampyre.\" One may imagine the feelings with which Mr. Bevan read this most strange aud cha racteristic epistle \u2014 feelings that for some moments kept him a prisoner to the most painful thoughts.

He had but, in fact, given him a better opportunity of carrying out a terrible design \u2014 a design which now there really did not appear to be any means of averting the consummation of. \"Alas \u2014 alas!\" he said, \"this is most grievous, and what can I do now to avert the mischief? Nothing, absolutely nothing. If it be true that he has, or he says he has, the means of hastening on his journey, all pursuit would be utterly useless.\" This was taking a decidedly correct view of the matter. Varney was not the sort of man, if he really intended to reach Naples quickly, to linger on his route, and then there was another view of the subject which could not but occur to Mr. Bevan, and that was, that his mentioned destina tion might be a blind to turn off pursuit. that it would be highly desirable to do so> and while he was considering the point, and holding the note in his hand, his eye fell upon the other papers which had been enclosed with it, and addressed to him. Hoping and expecting that there he should find something that would better qualify him to come to an accurate con clusion, he took up the packet, and found that the topmost paper bore the foUowing endorsement \u2014 \" SOME PARTICULARS CONCERNING MY OWN LIFE.\" \"There, then,\" said Mr. Bevan, \"is what he has promised me.\" It was to be expected that Mr. Bevan should take up those papers with a very considerable amount of curiosity, and as he could not think what course immediately to pursue that would do good to Varppv or anybody else, he thought he had better turn his attention at once to the documents that the vampyre had left to his perusal. Telling his servant, then, not to allow him to be disturbed unless the affair was a very urgent one, indeed, he closed the door of his study, and commenced reading one of the most singular statements that ever created being placed upon paper. It was as follows\u2014 ***** CHAPTER CXVII. VARNEY GIVES SOME PERSONAL ACCOUNT OF HIMSELF. ever had Mr. Bevan in all bis recollec- tion beon in such a state of During my brief intercourse \u2014 and it has always been \"brief when of a confidential nature with various persons \u2014 I have created surprise by talking of individuals and events long since swallowed up in the almost forgotten past. In these few pages I declare myself more fully. In the reign of the First Charles, I re sided in a narrow street, in the immediate neighbourhood of Whitehall. It was a straggling, tortuous thoroughfare, going, down to the Thames; it matters little what were my means of livelihood, but I have no hesitation in saying that I was a well paid agent in some of the political move ments which graced and disgraced that period. London was then a mass of mean-looking houses, with here and there one that looked like a palace, compared with its hnmbler neighbours. Almost every street appeared to be under the protection of some great house situated somewhere in its extent; but such of those houses aa have survived the wreck of time rank now with their neighbours, and are so strangely altered, that I, who knew many of them well, could now scarcely point to the place where they used to stand. I took no prominent part iu the commo tions of that period, but I saw the head of hesitation as now. He was a man '.sually of rapid re solves, and very energe tic action; but the circum- stances that had recently taken place were of so very remarkable a nature, that he was not able to bring to bear upon them any portion of his past experience. He felt that he could come to no deter mination, but was compelled by the irresis tible force of events to be a spectator in stead of an actor iu what might ensue. \" I shall hear,\" he thought, \" if any such event happens at Naples as that to which Varney has adverted, and until I do so, or until a sufficient length of time has elapsed to make me feel certain that he will not plunge into the burning abyss, I shall be a prey to every kind of fear ; and then again as regards Sir George Crofton. What am I to say to him ? Shall I show him this note or not ?\" Even that was a question which he conld not absolutely decide in his own mind, although he was strongly inclined to think"], [464, "VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE. 454 working apparel, and with a broom over his shoulder, would knock at my door and ask if he could be recommended to a lodg> ing, and that by those tokens I should know him to be Francis Latham. A Dutch lugger, I was further told, was lying near Gravesend, on board of which, to earn my money, I was expected to place the fugi tive. All this was dnly agreed upon; I had a boat in readiness, with a couple of water men upon whom I could depend, and Iwas far from anticipating any extraordinary difficulties in carrying out the enterprise. I bad a son about twelve years of age, who, being a sharp and acute lad, I found very useful upon several occasions, and I never scrupled to make him acquainted with any such affair as this, that I am re counting. Half-past twelve o'clock came, and in a very few minutes after that period of time, there came a knock at my door, which my son answered, and according to arrange ment, there was the person with a broom, who asked to be recommended to a lodg ing, and who was immediately requested to walk in. He seemed rather nervous, and asked me if I thought there was much risk. \" No,\" said I, \" no more than ordinary risk in all these cases, bat we must wait half an hour till the tide turns. For just now to struggle against it down the river would really be nothing else but courting observation.\" To this he perfectly agreed, and sat down by my fireside. I was as anxious as he to get the affair over, for it was a ticklish job, and Oliver Cromwell, if he had brought anything of the kind exactly home to me, would as leave order me to be shot as he would have taken his luncheon in the name of the Lord. the king held up in its gore at Whitehall as a spectacle for the multitude. There were thousands of persons in Eng land who had aided to bring about that re sult, but who were very far from expecting it, and who were the first to fall under the ban of the gigantic power they had them selves raised. Among these were many of my employ ers ; men, who had been quite willing to shake the stability of a throne so far as the individual occupying it was concerned ; but who certainly never contemplated the destruction of monarchy ; 60 the death of the First Charles, and the dictatorship of Cromwell, made royalists in abundance. They had raised a spirit tbey conld not quell again, and this was a fact which the stern, harsh man, Cromwell, with whom I had many interviews, was aware of. My house was admirably adapted for the purposes of seerecy and seclusion, and I became a thriving man from the large sums I received sor aiding the escape of distin guished royalists, some of whom lay sor a considerable time perdu at my house, be fore an eligible opportunity arrived of drop ping down the river quietly to some vessel which would take them to Holland. It was to offer me so much per head for these royalists that Cromwell sent for me, and there was one in particular who had been private secretary to the Duke of Clcve land, a youngman merely, of neither family nor rank, but of great ability, whom Crom well was exceedingly anxious to capture. I think there, likewise, must have been some private reasons which induced the dictator of the Commonwealth to be so anxious concerning this Master Francis Latham, which was the name of the per son alluded to. It was late one evening when a stranger came to my house, and having desired to see me, was shown into a private apart ment, when I immediately waited upon bim. I accordingly went down to the water side to speak to the men, who were lying there with the boat, and had ascertained from them that in about twenty minutes the tide would begin to ebb in the centre of the stream, when two men confronted me. Practised as I was in the habits and ap pearances of the times, I guessed at once who they were In fact, a couple of Oliver Cromwell's dismounted dragoons were always well known. \" You are wanted,\" said one of them to me. \" Yes, you are particularly wanted,\" said the other. \"But, gentlemen, I am rather busy,\" said I. \" In an hour's time I will do myself \" I am aware,\" he said, \" that you have been confidentially employed by the Duke of Cleveland, and I am aware that you have been very useful to distressed loyalists ; but in aiding Master Francis Latham, the duke's secretary, you will be permitted almost toname yonr own terms.\" I named a hundred pounds, which at that time was a much larger sum than now, taking into consideration the relative value. One half ot it was paid to me at once, and the other promised within four-and-twenty hours alter Latham had effected his escape. I was told that at half-past twelve o'clock that night, a man dressed in common"], [465, "VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE ; OR, THE FEAST OF BLOOD. 455 the pleasure, if you plet.se, of waiting upon you anywhere you wish to name.\" The only reply they made to this was the practical one of getting on each side of me, and then hurrying me on past my own door. I was taken right away to St. James's at a rapid pace; being hurried through one of the court-yards, we paused at a small door, at which was a sentinel. My two guides communicated some thing to him, and be allowed us to pass. THE VAMPYRE'S MIDNIGHT VISIT. heard the words His Highness, which was the title which Cromwell had lately as sumed. .

Cromwell was not a man to be tampered with ; I knew my danger, and was not disposed to sacrifice myself sor Master Latham. CHAPTER CXVIII. A SINGULAR INTERVIEW, AND THE CON- SEQUENCES OF PASSION. eino perfectly ignorant of where I was, I thought the most prudent plan was to stand stock still, for if I advanced it might be into danger, and my retreat was evidently cut off. \"Your highness shall be obeyed,\" I said. \"Ay, verily,\" he replied, \"and if we be not obeyed, we must make ourselves felt with a strong arm of flesh. What, ho I God-fearing Simpkins, art thou there?\" \" Yes, the Lord willing,\" said a dragoon, making his appearance at the door. Cromwell merely made him a sign with his hand, and he laid hold of the upper part of my arm, as though it had been in a vice, and led me out into the passage again where the sentinels were posted. In the course of a few moments I was duly in custody of my two guards again, and we were proceeding at a very rapid pace towards my residence. It was not a very agreeable affair, view it in whatever light I might ; but as re garded Cromwell, I knew my jeopardy, and it would be perceived that I had not hesitated a moment in obeying him. More over, I considered, for I knew he was generous, I should have a good round sum by the transaction, which added to the fifty pounds I had received from the royalists, made the affair appear to me in a pleasant enough light, indeed, I was revolving in my mind as I went along, whether it would not be worth while, almost entirely, to attach myself to the pro tector. Moreover, those who brought me there must have some sort of intention, and it was better sor me to leave them to develope it than to take any steps myself, which might be of a very hazardous nature. That I was adopting tbe best policy I was soon convinced, for a flash of light sud denly came upon me, and I heard a gruff voice say \u2014 _. ,.. . \" .. _. Ay, ... J. *' Who goes there? Come this way.\" I walked on, and passed through an open doorway into a small apartment, in the centre of whicb, standing by a com mon deal table on which his clenched hand was resting, I found Oliver Cromwell himself. \" So, sirrah,\" he said, \"royalists and tilent characters are to ravage tbe land, are they so? \u2014 answer me.\" \"I have no answer to make, your high ness,\" said I. \" God's mercy, no answer, when in your own house the Duke of Cleveland's pro scribed secretary lies concealed?\" I felt rather staggered, but was certain I had been betrayed by some one, and Cromwell continued rapidly, without giv ing me time to speak \u2014 \"The Lord is merciful, and so are we, but the malignant must be taken by the beloved soldiers of the Commonwealth, and the gospel God-fearing men, who always turn to the Lord, with short car bines will accompany you. The malignant shall be taken from your house, by you, and the true God-fearing men shall linger in the shade behind. You will take him to the river side, where, theLord willing, there will be a boat with a small blue ensign, on board of which you will place him, wishing him good speed.\" He paused, and looked fixedly upon me \"If,\" I reasoned with myself, \"I should do that, and still preserve myself a charac ter with the royalists, I should thrive.\" But it will be seen that an adverse circumstance put an end to all those dreams. When we reached the door of my hou'e, the first thing I saw was my son wiping his brow, as if he had undergone some fatigue ; he ran up to me, and catching me by the arm, whispered to me. I was so angered at the moment, that heedless of what I did, and passion get ting the mastery over me, I with my clenched fist struck him to the earth.

The damp smell of the grave hung about them. I met an a-;ed man, and asked him where I was. He looked at me with a shudder, as though I had escaped from some charnel house. \" Why, this is Isledon,\" said he. A peals of bells came merrily upon the night air. \" What means that?\" said I. I don't know what happened imme diately subsequent to this fearful deed ; all I can recollect is, that there was a great confusion and a flashing of lights, and it appeared to me as if something had sud denly struck me down to the earth with great force. When I did thoroughly awaken, I sound myself lying upon a small couch, but in a very large apartment dimly lighted, and where there were many such couches ranged against the walls. A miserable light just enabled me to see about me a little, and some dim, dusky-looking figures were creeping about the place. It was an hospital that the protector had lately instituted in the Strand. I tried to speak, but could not; my tongue seemed glued to my mouth, and I could not, and then a change came upon my sense of sight, and I could scarcely see at all the dim, dusky-looking figures about me. \" Why, this is the anniversary of the Restoration?\" \" The Restoration ! What Restora tion ?\" \" Why, of tho royal family to the throne, to be sure, returned this day last year. Have you been asleep so long that you don't know that?\" I shuddered and walked on, determined to make further inquiries, and to make them with so much caution, that the real extent of my ignorance should scarce be surmised, and the result was to me of the most astonishing character. Some one took hold of me be the wrist, and I heard one say, quite distinctly \u2014 \" He's certainly going, now.\" Suddenly it seemed as if something had fallen with a crushing influence upon my chest, and then a consciousness that I was gasping for breatb, and then I thought I was at the bottom of the sea. There was a moment, only a moment, of frightful agony, and then came a singing sound, like the rush of waters, after which, I distinctly felt some one raise me in their arms. I was dropped again, my limbs felt numbed and chill, an universal spasm\"shot through my whole system, I opened my eyes, and found myself lying in the open air, by a newly opened grave. A full moon was sailing through the sky, and the cold beams were upon my face ; a voice sounded in my ears, a deep and solemn voice \u2014 and painfully distinct was every word it uttered. I sound that I had been in the trance of death for nearly two years, and that during that peried, great political changes had taken place. The exiled royal family had been restored to the throne, and the most remarkable revulsion of feeling that had ever taken place in a nation had taken place in England. But personally I had not yet fully awakened to all the horror of what I was. I had heard the words addressed to me, but I had attached no very definite meaning to them. CHAPTER CXIX.

There was something yet to read in the papers before him, and thinking that it was better to know all at once than to leave his imagination to work upon matters so Ukely seriously to affect it, he resumed the peru sal of those papers, which might be consi dered the autobiography of Varney. ****** death, close to where I lay concealed, be- cause from the fashion of his garments, and the cut of his hair, he was supposed to be- long to the deposed party. But the long expected night came at last. It was a dark one. too, so that it | answered my purpose well. I had found an old rusty knife among the ruins, and with that I set to work to dig up my hidden treasure; I was success- ful and sound it all. Not a guinea had been removed, although in ihe immediate neighbourhocd there were those who would have sacrificed a human life sor any piece of gold tbat I had hoarded. I made no inquiries about any one that had belonged to me, I dreaded to receive some horrible and circumstantial answer; but I did get a slight piece of news, as I left the ruins, although I asked not sor it. \" There's a poor devil,\" said one ; \" did you ever see such a wretch in all your ' life ?\" f I have already said that I was not yet fully alive to the horror of what I was, but I soon found what the words which had been spoken to me by the mysterious being who had exhumed me meant ; I was a thing accursed, a something to be shunned by all men, a horror, a blight, and a deso lation. \" Why, yes,\" said another, \"he's enough to turn one's canary sour ; he seems to have come up from the ruins of Mortimer's house.

He murdered bis son, didn't he ?\" I passed on. Those words seemed to send a bolt of fire through the brain, and I dreaded that the speaker might expatiate upon them. A slow misty rain was falling, which caused the streets to be very much deserted, but being extremely well acquainted with the city, I passed on till 1 came to that quarter which was principally inhabited by Jews, who I knew would take my money without any troublesome questions being asked me, and also I could procure every accommodation required; and they did so, for before another hour had passed over my head, I emerged richly habited as a cavalier of the period, having really not paid to the conscientious Israelite much more than four times the price of the clothing I walked away with. And thus I was in the middle of Lon don, with some hundreds of pounds in my pocket, and a horrible uncertainty as to what I was. I reached my own house, and saw that it had been burned down ; there lay no thing but a heap of charred ruins where it once stood. But I had an interest in those ruins, for from time to time I had buried considera ble sums of money beneath the flooring of tbe lowest apartments, and I had every reason to believe, as such a secret treasure was only known to myself, that it remained nntonched. I waited until the moon became obscured by some passing clouds, and then having a most intimate knowledge of the locality, I commenced groping about the ruins, and removing a portion of them, until I made my way to the spot where my money was bidden. The morning came, however, and sur prised me at my occupation ; so I hid my self among the ruins of what had once been my home for a whole day, and never once stirred from my concealment. \" Oh, it was a long and weary day. I could hear the prattle of children at play, an inn or change-bouse was near at hand, and I could hear noisy drinkers brawling forth songs that had been proscribed in the Commonwealth. I was growing fainter and fainter still, and I feared that unless I succeeded ia housing myself shortly, 1 should become a prey to some one who, seeing my exhausted condition, would, notwithstanding I had a formidable rapier by my side rob me of all I possessed.

And there came over me the horrible faintness again, that faintness which each moment grew worse, and which threatened completely to engulph me. I feared that some flush of it would overtake me, and then I should fall to rise no more ; and strange as it may appear, I felt a disposi tion to cling to the new life that had been given to me. I seemed to be acquainted already with all its horrors, but not all its joys. Suddenly the darkness of the corridor was cleared away, and a soft aud mellow light crept into it, and I said to myself \u2014 \"The moon has risen.\" I passed on until I came to a street where I knew the houses were large but unfashionable, and that they were prin- cipally occupied by persons who made a trade by letting out apartments, and there I thought I might locate myself in safety. As I made no difficulty about terms, there was no difficulty at all of any sort, and I found myself conducted into a toler- ably handsome suite ot rooms in the house of a decent-looking widow woman, wbo had two daughters, young and blooming girls, both of whom regarded me, as the new lodger, with looks of anything but favour, considering my awful and cadaver- ous appearance most probably as promising nothing at all in the shape of pleasant com- panionship. This I was quite prepared for \u2014 I had seen myself in a mirror \u2014 that was enough ; aud I could honestly have averred that a more ghastly and horrible-looking skele- ton, attired in silks and broad-cloth, never yet walked the streets of the city. When I retired to my chamber, I was so faint and ill, that I could scarcely drag one soot after the other ; and was rumina- ting what I should do, until a strange feeling crept over me that I should like \u2014 what ? Blood ! \u2014 raw blood, reeking and hot, bubbling and juicy, from the veins of some gasping victim. A clock upon the stairs struck one. I arose and listened attentively; all was StiU in the house\u2014 still as the very grave. It was a large old rambling building, and had belonged at one time, no doubt, to a man of some mark and Ukelihood in the world. My chamber was one of six that opened from a corridor of a consider- able length, and whicb traversed the whole length of the house. I crept out into this corridor, and listened again for full ten minutes, but not the slightest 60und, save my own faint breathing, disturbed tho stillness of the house ; and that emboldened me so that, with my appetite for blood growing each moment stronger, I began to ask myself from whose veins I could seek strength and nourishment. Yes, the bright and beautiful moon, which I had felt the soft influence of when I lay among the graves, had emerged from the bank of cloud3 along the eastern sky, its beams descending through a little win dow. They streamed right through the corridor, faintly but effectually illuminating it, and letting me see clearly all the differ ent doors leading to tbe different chambers. And thus it was that I had light for any thing I wished to do, but not information. The monbeams playing upon my face seemed to give me a spurious sort of strength. 1 did not know until after ex perience what a marked and sensible effect they would always have upon me, but 1 felt it even then, although I did not attri bute it wholly to the influence of the queenly planet. I walked on through the corridor, and some sudden influence seemed to guide me to a particular door. I know not how it was, but I laid my hand upon the lock, and said to myself \u2014 \" I shall find my victim here.' CHAPTER CXX.

Her lips were parted, as though some pleasant images were passing in her mind, and induced a slight smile even in his sleep. She murmured twice, too, a word, which I thought was the name of some one\u2014 perchance the idol of her young heart \u2014 but it was too indistinct sor me to catch it, nor did I care to hear ; that which was perhaps a very cherished secret, indeed, mattered not to me. I made no pretensions to her affections, however strongly in a short time I might stand in her abhorrence. greatly. Perhaps even then if a great ac cession of strength had come to my aid mere bodily aid I mean\u2014 I should have hesitated, and the vies u would have escaped me ; but, as it to mock me, there came that frightful seeling of exhaustion which felt so like the prelude to another death. I no longer hesitated; I turned the lock of the door, and 1 thought that I must be discovered. I lelt it open about an inch, and then flew back to my own chamber. I listened attentively ; there was no alarm, no movement in any of the rooms \u2014 the same death-like stillness pervaded the house, and I felt that I was still safe. A soft gleam of yellow-looking light had come through the crevice of the door when I had opened it. It mingled strangely with the moonlight, and I concluded cor rectly enough, as I found afterwards, that a light was burning in the chamber. It was at least another ten minutes be fore I could sufficiently re-assure myself to glide from my own room and approach tbat of the fated sleeper ; but at length I told myself tbat I might safely do so, and the night was waning fast, and if anything was to be accomplished it must be done at once, before the first beams of early dawn should chase away the spirits of the night, and, perhaps, should leave me no power to act. One of her arms, which was exquisitely rounded, lay upon the coverlit; a neck, too, a9 white as alabaster, was particularly exposed to my gaze, but I had no passions \u2014 it was food I wanted. I sprung upon her. There was a shriek, but not before I had secured a draught of life blood from her neck. It was enough. I felt it dart through my veins like fire, and I was restored. From that moment I sound out what was to be my sustenance; it was blood \u2014 the blood of tho young and the beautiful. The house was thoroughly alarmed, but not before I had retired to my own cham ber. I was but partially dressed, and those few clothes I threw off me, and get ting into bed, I feigned to be asleep; so that when a gentleman who slept likewise in the house, but of whose presence I knew nothing, knocked loudly at my door, I affected to awaken in a fright, and called out, \u2014 \"What shall I be,\" I asked myself, \"after another four-and-twenty hours of exhaustion ? Shall I have power, then, to make the election of what I will do or what I will not ? No, I may suffer the pangs of death again, and the scarcely less pangs of another revival.\" This reasoning \u2014 if it may be called reasoning \u2014 decided me; and with cautious and cat-like footsteps, I again approached the bed- room door which I had opened. I no longer hesitated, but at once crossed the threshold, and looked around me. It Was the chamber of the youngest of my landlady's daughters, who, as far as I could judge, seemed to be about sixteen years of age ; but they had evidently been so struck with my horrible appearance, that they had placed themselves as little as possible in my way, so that I could not be said to be a very good judge of their ages or of their looks. \"What is it? what is it?\u2014 sor God's sake tell me iflit is a fire?\" \"No, no \u2014 but get up, sir, get up. There's some one in the place. An attempt at murder, I think, sir.\" I arose and opened the door, so by the light he carried he saw that I had to dress myself \u2014 he was but half attired himself, and he carried his sword beneath his arm. \"It is a strange thing,\" he said; \"but I have heard a shriek of alarm.\" \"And I likewise,\" said I; \"but I thought it was a dream.\" \"Help! help ! help !\" cried the widow, who had risen, but stood upon the thres hold of her own chamber; \"thieves! thieves !\" I only knew sbe was the youngest, be cause she wore ber hair long, and wore it in ringlets, which were loose and streaming over the pUlow on which she slept, while her sister, I remarked, wore her hair plaited up, and completely off her neck and shoulders. By this time I bad got on sufficient of my apparel that I could make an appear ance, and, likewise with my sword iu my haud, 1 saUied out into the corridor. \" Oh, gentlemen \u2014 gentlemen,\" cried tho landlady, with terror in her face, \" did you hear anything?\" \" A shriek, madam,\" said my fellow- I stood by the bed-side, and looked"], [471, "461 THE FEAST OF BLOOD. lodger; \" have you looked into your daugh ters' chambers?\" meet at eleven in your apartment or in mine?\" The room of the yonngest daughter was the nearest, and into that she went at once. In another moment she appeared on the threshold again with a face as white as a sheet, then she wrung her hands, and said, \u2014 \" Whichever you may please to consider the most convenient, sir.\" \" I mention my own then, which is the furthest door in the corridor, and where I shall be happy to see you at eleven o'clock.\" \"Murder! murder! \u2014 my child is mur dered \u2014 my child is murdered, Master Harding,\" \u2014 which I found was the name of my feUow-lodger. \" Fling open one of the windows, and call for the watch,\" said he to me, \"and I will search the room, and woe be to any one that I may find within its waUs un authorised.\" There was a something about this young man's manner which I did not al together like, and yet I could not come to any positive conclusion as to whether he suspected me, and therefore I thought it would be premature to fly, when perhaps there would be really no occasion tor doing so ; on the contrary, I made up my mind to wait the result of the evening, which might or might not be disastrous to me. At all events, I considered that I was fully equal to taking my own part, and if by the decrees of destiny I was really to be, as it were, repudiated from society, and made to endure a new, strange, and horri ble existence, I did not see that I was called upon to be particular how I rescued myself from difficulties that might arise. Relying, then, upon my own strength, and my own unscrupulous use of it, I awaited with tolerable composure the coming of night. During the day I amused myself by walking about, and noting the remarkable changes which so short a period as two years had made in London. But these happened to be two years most abundantly prolific in change. The feelings and habits of people seemed to have undergone a thorough revolution, which I was the more surprised at when I learned by what thorough treachery the restoration of the exiled family was effected. The day wore on ; I felt no need of refreshment, and I began to feel my own proper position, rand to feel that occasion ally a draught of delicious life-blood, such as I had quaffed the night before, was fresh marrow to my bones. I could see, when I entered the house where I had made my temporary home, that notwithstanding that I considered my appearance wonderfully improved, that feeling was not shared in by others, for the whole family shrunk from me as though there bad been a most frightful contamina tion in my touch, and as though the very air I had breathed was hateful and dele terious. I felt convinced that there had been some conversation concerning me, and that I was rather more than suspected. I certainly could then have left the place easily and quietly, but I had a feeling of defiance, which did not enable me to do I did as he desired me, and called the watch, but the watch came not, and then, upon a second visit to her daughter, the landlady found she had only sainted, and that she had been deceived in thinking she was murdered by the sudden sight of tho blood upon her neck, so the house was re stored to something like quiet again, and the morning being now near at hand, Mr. Harding retired to his chamber, and I to mine, leaving the landlady and her eldest daughter assiduous in their attentions to the younger. How wonderfully revived I felt \u2014 I was quite a new creature when the sunlight came dancing into my apartment. I dressed and was about to leave the house, when Mr. Harding came ont of one of the lower rooms, and intercepted me. \" Sir,\" he said, \" I have not the pleasure of knowing you, but I bave no doubt that an ordinary feeling of chivalry will prompt you to do all in your power to obviate the dread of such another night as the past.\" \" Dread, sir,\" said I, \" the dread of what?\" \" A veryproper question,\" he said, \" but one I can hardly answer; the girl states, she was awakened by some one biting ber neck, and in proof of her story she actually exhibits the marks of teeth, and so terrified is she, that she declares that she shall never be able to sleep again.\" \" You astonish me.\" \" No doubt \u2014 it is sufficiently astonishing to excuse even doubts ; but if you and I, who are both inmates of the house, were to keep watch to-night in the corridor, it might have the effect of completely quiet ing the imagination of the young girl, and perhaps result in the discovery of this noc turnal disturber ofthe peace.\" \" Certainly,\" said I, \" command me in any way, I shall havo great pleasure.\" \" Shall it be understood, then, tbat we so."], [472, "VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE. 462 I felt as if I were an injured being, and ought to resist a something that looked like oppression. \"Why,\" I said to myself, \"have I been rescued from the tomb to be made the sport of a malignant destiny? My crime was a great one, but surely I suffered enough when I suffered death as an expia tion of it, and I might have been left to repose in the grave.\" The feelings that have since come over me held no place in my imagination, but with a kind of defiant desperation, I felt as if I should like to defeat the plan by which I was attempted to be punished, and even in the face of Providence itself, to show that it was a failure, entailing far worse conse quences upon others than upon me. This was my impression, so I would not play the coward, and fly upon the first flash of danger. I sat in my own room until the hour came for my appointment with Mr. Hard ing, and then 1 walked along the corridor with a confident step, and let the hilt end of my scabbard clank along the floor. I knocked boldly at the door, and I thought there was a little hesitation in his voice as he bade me walk in, but this might have been only my imagination. He was seated at a table, fully dressed, and in addition to his sword, there was lying upon the table before him a large holster pistol, nearly half the size of a carbine. this, ami looking at me very steadily, ha took up the pistol and examined the prim ing. Of course, that was all right, and he appeared to be perfectly satisfied. \" There will be two chairs and a table,\" he said, \" placed in the corridor, so that we can sit in perfect ease. I will not antici pate that anything will happen, but if it should, I can only say that I will not be backward in the use of my weapons.\" \" I don't doubt it,\" said I, \"and com mend you accordingly. That pistol must be a most formidable weapon. Does it ever miss fire?\" \" Not that I know of,\" he said. \"I have loaded it with such extraordinary care that it amounts to almost an impossibUity that it should. Will you take some wine?\" At this moment there camea loud knock ing at the door of the house. I saw an expression of satisfaction come over his face, and he sprung to his feet, holding the pistol in his grasp. \"Do you know the meaning of that knocking,\" said I, \" at such an hour?\" and at the same time with a sweep of my arm I threw his sword off the table and beyond bis reach. \"Yes,\" he said, rather excitedly ; \"you are my prisoner ; it was you who caused the mischief and confusion last night. The girl is ready to swear to you, and if you attempt to escape, I'll blow your brains out.\" \" Fire at me,\" said I, \" and take the con sequences \u2014 but the threat is sufficient, and you shall die for your temerity.\" I drew mv sword, and he evidently thought his danger imminent, for he at once snapped the pistol in my face. Of course it only flashed in the pan, but in one moment my sword went through him like a flash of light. It was a good blade the Jew had sold me \u2014 the hilt struck against bis breast bone, and he shrieked. Bang \u2014 bang \u2014 bank ! came again at the outer door of the house. I withdrew the reeking blade, dashed it into the scabbard just in time to prevent my landlady from opening the door, which she was almost in the act of doing. I seized her by the back of the neck, and hurled her to a con siderable distance, and then opening the door myself, I stood behind it, and let three men rush into the house. After which I quietly left it, and was free.\" \" You are well prepared,\" said I, as I pointed to it. \"Yes,\" he said, \"and I mean to use it.\" \"What do they want now?\" I said. \"What do who want?\" \"I don't know,\" I said, \"but I thought 41 heard some one call you by name from below.\" \" Indeed ; excuse me a moment ; per haps they have made some discovery.\" There was wine upon the table, and while he was gone, I poured a glass of good Rhe nish down the barrel of the pistol. I wiped it carefully with the cuff of my coat, so there was no appearance upon the barrel of anything of the sort, and when he came back, he looked at me very suspiciously, as he said \u2014 \"Nobody called me, how could you say I was called?\" \"Because I thought I heard you called; I suppose it is allowable for human nature to be fallible now and then?\" \" Yes, but then I am so surprised how you could make such a mistake.\" \" So am I.\" It was rather a difficult thin to answer"], [473, "VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE ; OR, THE FEAST OF BLOOD. 463 CHAPTER CXXI. .

I was much revived by the draught of >od I had already had, but as yet I was fficiently new to my vampyre-like exist- ce not to know how long such a renewal my life and strength would last me. I certainly felt vigorous, but it was a range, unearthly sort of vigour, having i sort of resemblance whatever to the rength which persons in an ordinary state existence may be supposed to feel, when re faculties are all full of life, and acting gether harmoniously and well When I paused, I found myself in Pall 'all, and not far off from the palace of .

They looked nothing peculiar at the rst glance, but when you came to examine ,e form smd features, and to observe the anners of those two men, you could not it come to a conclusion that they were hat the world would estimate as some- ing great. I had carefully kept out of sight while the little dialogue I have just recorded took place, so that althongh they more than once glanced around them suspiciously and keenly, they saw me not, and having quite satisfied themselves that their imprudent speech had done them no harm, they walked on hurriedly in the direction of Pimlico. Little did Charles and his companion gness how horrible a being was following close npon their track. If they had done so they might have paused aghast, and pur sued another course to that which was occupying their attention. I had a diffi cult part to play in following them, for although the king was incautious enough to have been safely and easily followed by any one, Rochester was not, but kept a wary eye around him, so that I was really more than once upon the point of being detected, and yet by dint of good manage ment I did escape. Pimlico at that time was rather a miser able neighbourhood, and far, very far indeed from being what it is now, but both the king and Rochester appeared to be well Adventure to me was life itself, now that had so strangely shuffled off all other .,s that bound me to the world, and I id a reckless disregard of danger, which ose naturally enough from my most sin llar and horrible tenure of existence.

Take it for all in all, it certainly was a handsome place. The king and Rochester were urging the ladies to drink wine, and now that for the first time I had an opportunity of seeing the countenances of the different persons whom I had followed so far, I confess that I looked upon them with much curiosity. The ladies were decidedly handsome, and the youngest who had fallen to the lot of the king was very pretty, indeed, and had a look of great innocence and sweetness upon her face. I pitied her. The king was a small, dark, sharp-fea- tured man, and I thought that there was an obliquity in his vision. As for Roches- ter, he was decidedly ugly. His face was rather flat, and of a universal dirty-looking white colour. He certainly was not cal culated to win a lady's favour.

At length, how- ever, he succeeded in doing so, and the door swung open. The king dropped the key and was unable to find it again ; so leaving the door as close as they could, the party passed onwards, and I soon fol- lowed in their footsteps. The place was profoundly dark. I could feel the 6oft grating of fine gravel under my feet, and feeling that such a sand might betray me, I stepped aside untU I trod upon a border, as I found it to be, of velvet turf. The odour of sweet flowers came upon my senses, and occasionally as the night wind swept among the trees, there would be a pleasant murmuring sound quite musical in its effect. The soft soil effectually prevented my footsteps from being heard, and I soon stood quite close to the parties, and found that they were at tbe entrance of a little gaudy pavilion, from a small painted win- dow in which streamed a light. The ladies seemed to be rather in \u00ab, flutter of apprehension, and yet the whole aflair no doubt to them presented itself in the shape of such a charming and romantic adventure, that I very much doubt if they would have gone back now, had they had all the opportunity in the world so to do. Finally they all went into the pavilion. I then advanced, and finding a window that commanded a good view of the in terior, I looked in and was much amused at what passed. CHAPTER CXXIII. AN ADVENTURE.\u2014 THE CARBINE SHOT. THE DEATH. ay,\" I heard the king say, \" they ought, and no doubt do, keep choice wine here ; drink, fair one.\" The young girl shook her head. \"Nay, now,\" said Charles 'WOMHIK\u0153 with a laugh, as he finished off himself the glass that the young girl took so small a sip of \" I will convince you tbat I think it good.\" The lady with whom Rochester was conversing in a low tone had no such scrnples, for sbe tossed off a couple of glasses as fast as they were tendered to her, aud talked quite at her ease, admiring the pavilion, the pictures, the hangings and furniture, and wondering whether the king ever came there himself. The place was decorated in a tasteful manner, although a little approaching to the gaudy, and the pictures painted in fresco upon the walls were not precisely wbt.t the strictest prudery would have con sidered correct, while at the same time there was nothing positively offensive in them. A table stood in the centre, and was covered with rich confectionery and wine, whiie the lamp that had sent the stream of light through the painted window was Rochester began mystifying her, talking to her in a low tone, while I turned my attention to the king, and the younger, and"], [477, "THE FEAST OP BLOOD. 467 certainly more estimable female of the two. \" The garden door is open,\" I whispered to her, \" follow me quickly, not a moment is to be lost.\" We both fled together to wards the eutrance. The king had been talking to her in a low tone, when she suddenly started to ber feet, her face flushed with anger and alarm. \"Louisa,\" she said, \"I claim yourpro tection ; you were left in care of me. Take me home, or I will tell my uncle how you basely betrayed your trust, by pur snading me there was no harm in meeting those gentlemen.\" \" Pho ! the child's mad,\" said Louisa. \" Quite mad,\" said the king, as he ad vanced towards her again ; she fled to the door of the pavilion. I knew not what im pulse it was that urged me on, but I lest the window hastily, and met her ; she fell into my arms, and the light fell strongly npon me as I confronted the king. \" The guard \u2014 the guard !\" he shouted. Louisa pretended to faint, and the young girl clung to me as her only protector, ex claiming \u2014 \" Save me\u2014 save me ! Ob, save me !\" I was about to pass through the door way, when a shot from one of the guards struck me, and I fell to the ground as if the hand of a giant had struck me down. There was a rush of blood from my heart to my head, a burning sensation of pain for a moment or two that was most horri ble, and then a sea of yellow light seemed to be all around me. I remembered no more. It was afterwards that I found this was my second death, and that tbe favourite, Rochester, had actually directed that I should be shot rather than permitted to escape, for be dreaded more than the monarch did the exposure of his vices. I do not think that Charles, in like manner, had he been at hand, would have had my life taken, although it is bard to say what kings will do or what they will not when they are thwarted. CHAPTER CXXIV. THE TOTAL DESTRUCTION OP VARNEY THE VAMPYRE, AND CONCLUSION. since, a tall and melancholy-looking stranger arrived, and put up at one of the principal hotels at Naples. He was a most pecufiar-looking man, and considered by persons of the establishment as about the ugliest guest thay had ever had within the walls of their place. \" In a short time he summoned the land lord, and the following conversation ensued between bim and tbe strange guest. \" ' I want,' said the stranger, ' to see all the curiosities of Naples, and among the rest Mount Vesuvius. Is there any difficulty ?' he manuscript which the clergyman had read with - so much in- terest, here ab- ruptly termi- nated. He was left to conclude that Varney after that had been resuscitated ; and he was \"\u2022' None,' replied the landlord, 'with a proper guide.' \"A guide was soon secured, who set out with the adventurous Englishman to make the ascent of the burning mountain. \" They went on, then, until the guide did not think it quite prudent to go any fur ther, as there was a great fissure in the side ofthe mountain, out of which a stream of lava was slowly issuing and spreading itself in rather an alarming manner. \"The ugly Englishman, however, pointed to a secure mode of getting higher still, and they proceeded untU they were very more perplexed than ever to come to an opinion concerning the truth of the narra tion which he had now concluded. It was one week after he bad finished the perusal of Varney's papers that the clergyman read in an English newspaper the following statement \u2014 \"We extract from the A/gemeine Zei t-ung ihe following most curious story, the accuracy of which, of course, we cannot vouch for ; but still there is a sufficient air of probability about it to induce us to pre sent it to our readers. \" Late in the evening, about four days"], [478, "VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE. 468 \" 'You will make what haste you can, said the stranger, ' from the mountain, in asmuch as it is covered with sulphurous vapours, inimical to human life, and when you reach the city, you will cause to be published an account of my proceedings, and what I say. You will say that you accompanied Varney the Vampyre to the crater of Mount Vesuvius, and that, tired and disgusted with a life of horror, he flung himself in to prevent the possibility of a reanimation of his remains.' near the edge of the crater itself. The stranger theu took his purse from his pocket, and flung it to the guide, saying\u2014 '\"You can laeep that for your pains, and for coming into some danger with me. But the fact was, that I wanted a witness to an act which I have set my mind upon performing.' \" The guide says that these words were 6poken with so much calmness, that he verily believed the act mentioned as about to be done was eome scientific experiment of which he knew that the EngUsh were very fond, and he replied\u2014 \" ' Sir, I am only too proud to serve so generous and so distinguished a gentleman. Iu what way can I be useful V \" Before then the truide could utter any thing but a shriek, Varney took one tre mendous leap from tbe spot, and disap peared into the burning mouth of the mountain.\" .
