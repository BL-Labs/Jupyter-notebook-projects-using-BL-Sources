XJREVIOUS to entering upon a detailed history of the origin, progress, and present state of the great Ame rican Commonwealth, it will be necessary to take a concise view of the first discoveries in North America, and its -early settlement by various European colonies ; the prin cipal of which were composed of adventurers from Great Britain. The glory acquired by the immortal Columbus on dis covering South America in the year 1492, spread rapidly throughout Europe, and inspired many persons of learn ing and genius with an ardent spirit of enterprize. As early as the year 1496, only four years after the first discovery of America, John Cabot, by birth \u201e Venetian, but a subject of the King of England, having obtained a commission from Henry VIE to discover unknown lands, and annex them to the British crown, sailed for China, accompanied by his three sons. On this voyage he fell in with the coast of Labrador, along which he proceeded as far as 67 deg. N. latitude. The year following in company with his son Sebastian, he undertook a second voyage, and on the 24th of June, It. 7> discovered the Island of Newfoundland, and before his return traversed the Coast from Davis's Straits to Cape Florida. In 1502, Sebastian Cabot again fell in with Newfound land, and, on his return, carried three of the natives of that Island to England, and presented them to his patron, Henry VII. In the spring of 1513, John Ponce sailed from Port Rico in the West Indies, and discovered the Continent of America in 30 deg. N. lat. a short distance no. 1. B"], [18, "4 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. from where the town of Pensacola now stands. Here he landed ; and finding the country overspread with a delightful verdure, and the trees and herbs in full bloom, named it Florida ; which for long after was the common name of both North and South America It was not until the year 1524 that France attempted to make discoveries in America. For this purpose, John Verazanno, a native of Italy, was sent out by Francis 1. and having traversed the coast from lat. 28 deg. to 50 deg. N. returned to Europe ; in a second voyage some time after he was lost at sea. The next year, Stephen Gomez sailed from Spain to Cuba and Florida, and from thence as far as 46 deg. N. lat. in search of a north west passage to China. In 1534, a fleet was sent from France, under James Cartier, for the purpose of making discoveries in Ame rica. \u2014 He arrived at Newfoundland in May, and on the 10th of August found himself in abroad gulf, which, with the river that falls into it, he named St. Lawrence, in honour of the day. In this voyage he coasted as far north as lat. 51 deg. expecting in vain to find a passage to China. The next year he sailed 200 leagues up the river St. Lawrence, named the country New France, where he built a fort, in which he resided during the winter, and in the ensuing spring returned to France. In 1542, the French King sent three ships to Canada, carrying 200 men, women, and children. They built a fort, and wintered there, but returned home in the spring. In 1540, Alverdo, a Spaniard, who had sailed from Cuba with a view to conquer Florida, on the 30th of May arrived at Spirito Santo, in South America, from whence he travelled 450 leagues from the sea. Here he discovered a river a quarter of a mile wide and nineteen fathoms deep, on the banks of which he built seven small vessels ; with these he proceeded down the river 400 leagues, and arrived in the gulf of Mexico. This river must be that which is now called Mississippi. In 1562, St Mary's river in Georgia, which forms a"], [19, "5 EARLY SETTLEMENTS. part of the southern boundary of the United States, was explored by John Hi bait, who was sent from France to pursue discoveries in America. To another river he gave the name of Port Royal, and built a fort, which he called Charles. Here he left a colony under Captain Albert; but the tyranny of Albert's conduct having occasioned a mutiny, the colony was ruined and the commander slain. Two years after, the Frenchkingsencthreesh.ps to Florida, under the command of Laudonier. In June he arrived at St. Mary's river, where he built a fort, and in honour of his master, Charles IX. called it Carolina. In August this year, Captain Ribalt arrived a second time at Florida, with a fleet of seven vessels to recruit the colony which he had left under the ill-fated Albert. But a few weeksafter wards Pedro Melandes, with six Spanish ships, pursued Ribalt up the river, overpowered him with numbers, and cruelly m..ssacred him andhiswholecompany. \u2014 Melandes now erected three forts, and garrisoned them with 1200 soldiers. The French commander on St. Mary's river, Laudonier, having heard of the fate of Ribalt, took the alarm, and escaped with his colony to France. In 1576, Captain Martin Frobisher, a native of Don caster in Yorkshire, was sent by Queen Elizabeth to find out a north-west passage to the East Indies. The first land he made on the American coast, was a cape ; which, in honour to his mistress, he called Queen Eliz abeth's Foreland. He afterwards discovered the Straits which bear his name, situated between Hudson's Bay and Davis's Straits ; but being prevented by the ice from prosecuting his search for a passage to the East, he re turned to Ingland. In 1579, Sir Humphry Gilbert obtained a patent from the Queen, for lands not yet possessed by any Christian Prince, provided he took possession within six years. \u2014 With this encouragement he sailed for America, and in August, 1583, anchored in Conception Bay. He after wards discovered and took possession of St. John's harbour, in New Brunswick, and all the adjacent country ; b _"], [20, "6 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. but in pursuing his discoveries, one of hisships foundered ; and on his return home, he was unfortunately lost. In 1584, two patents were granted to Sir Walter Raleigh and Adrian Gilbert, similar to that obtained by Sir Humphrey Gilbert five years before. Accordingly two ships were sent out under the command of Philip Amidas and Arthur Barlow, who landed twenty miles west of Roanoke river. On the 13th of July, they for mally took possession of the country, and in honour of their virgin Queen Elizabeth, called it Virginia. Before this time it was known by the general name of Florida. In the following year, Sir Walter Raleigh fitted out seven ships under Sir Richard Grenville, who arrived in Virginia in the month of June. Having stationed a colony of about 1 OO persons at Roanoke, under the go vernment of Captain Ralph Lane, he traversed the coast as far north-east as Chesapeak Bay, and then re turned to England. \u2014 Captain Lane's colony having suf fered the utmost hardships, would certainly have perished, had not Sir Francis Drake, after having made many conquests, fortunately landed in Virginia, and carried them to their native country. A fortnight after, Sir Richard Grenville arrived with more adventurers ; and though the colony which he before stationed could not be found, nor did he know but they had all died of famine, yet he had the temerity to leave fifty persons on the same spot. In the year 1587, Sir Walter sent out another supply of recruits to Virginia, under Governor White. He ar rived at Roanoke in the month of July ; but none of the fifty men left by Grenville then remained. Not withstanding this misfortune, he resolved to hazard a third colony ; and accordingly left 115 persons and re turned to England. In 1590, Governor White arrived at Roanoke, with a supply of recruits ancl provisions for his colony ; but to his great surprise and affliction, not an individual was to be found."], [21, "7 EARLY SETTLEMENTS. In the year 1602, Captain Gosnold, with thirty others, discovered and gave names to Cape Cod, in Massachusetts, then known by the general name of North Virginia ; and also to Elizabeth Island, and Martha's Vineyard, two islands upon the coast ; in the former of which they intended to establish their first colony. Not having sufficient resolution to make the at-ttempt, they all re embarked and returned to England. In 1603, Sir Walter Raleigh despatched Martin Pring and Wm. Brown, in two small ships, to make further disoveries in North Virginia. In lat 43 deg. 30 min. N. they fell in with a multitude of Islands ; and having coasted southward round Cape Cod, they anchored in a good harbour in lat. 41 deg. 25 min. where they landed; and after remaining seven weeks, loaded one of their vessels with sassafras and returned home. This year Bartholomew Gilbert sailed for South Virginia in search of the third colony, left there by Governor White sixteen years before. After having visited several islands in the WTest Indies, he landed in the Bay of Chesapeak, where he and four of his men were slain by the natives. The remainder of his people, without searching further for the colony, sailed for England. In 1604, the King of France granted a patent to De Mons, of all the lands in America, from the 40th to the 46th degree of N. lat. under the name of Acadia. He accordingly traversed the coast from the river St. Lawrence, to Cape Sable, the most northerly point of Nova Scotia, and from thence round to Cape Cod. In May, 1605, Captain George Weymouth discovered George's Island and Pentecost Harbour. He afterwards entered a river in N. lat. 43 deg. 20 min. which from its situation, appears to have been the Piscataqua in New Hampshire. From this place he carried five of the natives with him to England. In the spring of the year 1606, King James I. by patent, divided Virginia in two colonies, under the names North and South Virginia. The southern including all"], [22, "8 UNITED STATES OF A-MERICA. the territory between 34deg. and 4 1 deg.N.lat. was called the,/, sf colony, and granted to the London Company. The northern was styled the second colony, and com prised all lands between 38 deg. and 45 deg. N. ; this was granted to the Plymouth Company. Each of these colonies was governed by a council of thirteen persons ; and, to prevent disputes relative to property in land, the companies were prohibited from settling within a hundred miles of each other. There seems, however, to have been an important error in the grants ; as the space between the S8th and 4 1st degree is included in both patents. In pursuance of the above grants, the London Com pany sent over Mr. Percy, brother to the Earl of Nor thumberland, with a colony to South Virginia, where he discovered Powhatan, now called James River. \u2014 About the same time, Captain Challons was sent by the Plymouth Company to fix a colony in North Virginia ; but on his passage he was captured by the Spaniards, and carried into Spain. In 1607, the London Company sent three vessels laden with adventurers to South Virginia, under the com mand of Captain Newport. In April he landed in Chesapeak Bay, the most southerly point of which he called Cape Henry, a name which still it retains. \u2014 On the 13th of May, they commenced a settlement on James River, appointed Mr. Edward Wingfield their presi dent for that year, and named the place James Town. This was the first town settled by the English in North America. A month after, Captain Newport returned to England, leaving in the colony 10) persons. In August died Captain Gosnold, who had failed in his attempt to settle on Elizabeth Island in 1602. He was the original projector of this settlement, and a member of the council. The following winter James Town was de stroyed by fire. On the 31st of May this year, the Plymouth Com pany sent out two ships with a hundred planters, and"], [23, "9 EARLY SETTLEMENTS. Captain Popham for their President, under the command of Admiral Gilbert. They arrived in August, and formed a settlement about thirty miles south of Sag adahok in the district of Maine. The severity of the ensuing winter having discouraged the greater part of the colony, they returned to England, leaving only their president and forty five men. In autumn this year, the celebrated Mr. Robinson, with part of his congregation, who thirteen years afterwards settled at Plymouth, in Massachusetts, removed from the north of England to Holland, to avoid religious persecution, and to enjoy liberty of conscience. It was in this year also, that Quebec was founded by a colony sent out by a few French merchants. The adventurers built a few huts on the spot ; but it did not assume the form or name of a town until many years after, in the reign of Louis XIV. In the year 160S, the small colony which had been left at Sagadahok, in the preceding summer, suffered intolerable distress. The discouraging accounts given by these and other unfortunate adventureis, prevented any further attempts to colonize North Virginia for a great number of years afterwards. In the year 1610, the London Company having obtained a new commission from the crown, appointed the following persons officers of their colony in South Virginia, viz. Lord De la War, General ; Sir Thomas Gates, his Lieutenant ; Sir George Somers, Admiral ; Sir Thomas Dale, High Marshal ; Sir F. Wainman, Commander of the Horse ; and Captain Newport, Vice Admiral. This year, five hundred men, women, and children, under the direction of Gates, Newport, and Somers, sailed for South Virginia in nine vessels. In crossing the Bahama Gulf, the fleet was separated by a violent storm, and Sir George Somers' ship, containing 130 passengers, wrecked on one of the Bermuda Islands, which have ever since been called the Somer Islands."], [24, "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 10 The people having been all safely landed, remained there for nine months; and were employed during most ot that time iii constructing a vessel to convey them to the continent. The remainder of the fleet arrived safe at Virginia, and increased the colony to five hundred men. At \"this period, Captain Smith was president, but having received considerable bodily injury, from an accidental explosion of gunpowder, and experiencing much oppo sition from the last arrived settlers, he returned to England, and was followed soon after by his successor, Francis West, upon which George Percy was elected president. In March, 1610, Lord De la War being appointed governer over South Virginia, embarked for that country, accompanied by Captain Argal and a hundred and fifty men, in three ships. In the mean time, the people who had been wrecked on the Bermudas the year before, having built a vessel, sailed for Virginia on the 12th of May, with about 150 persons on buard, leaving two men behind who chose to remain on the Island. Upon their arrival they found that the number of their countrymen, which at the time of Captain Smith's departure amounted to five hundred was now reduced to sixty, and even those were in a very wretched and hopeless state. Under these circumstances, they unanimously determined on returning to England ; and on the 7th of June dissolved the colony, embarked on board their vessels, and preceded down James River on their return home. On the day after, they were happily met by Lord De la War, who had just arrived on the coast, and who persuaded them to return with him to James Town. The government of _. the colony now devolved upon Lord De la War, and from thence may be dated the effectual settlement of Virginia. In 1613, the South Virginian colony sent Captain Argal to dispossess the French of some forts, which had been erected within their limits. He accordingly sailed to Sagadahok, and captured the forts at Mount"], [25, "STATISTICAL TABLE OF THE UNITED STATES. STATES AND TERRITORIES. EXTENT. AREA. >PULAT ON. n n 4.-s CHIEF TOWNS.

In April he arrived at the Island of Monahigan, in N. lat. 43 deg. 30 min. and attempted whale-fishing, which proving abortive, he despatched most of his men in seven boats, who where very fortunate in taking a large quantity of fish of different kinds. During the absence of the boats, the captain himself, with only eight men, coasted in a small vessel from Penobscot to Cape Cod, and from thence returned to Monahigan. In this voyage he found two French ships in Massachusetts Hay, who for six weeks had carried on a very advantageous trade with the natives. In July Captain Smith sailed for England in one of his vessels, leaving the other under Captain Hunt, with orders to prepare for a trading voyage to Spain. Instead of obeying these instructions, Hunt treacherously inveigled twenty-seven Indians, (one of whom was Squanto, afterwards so friendly to the English) on board his vessel, and carried them to Malaga, where he sold them to be slaves for life, at the rate of twenty pounds per head. Between the years 1 6 14 and 1620, great exertions were made by the Plymouth Company to colonize New England ; but every attempt proved ineffectual, though at the same time a lucrative trade was carried on with the native Indians. In the latter year, a part of Mr. Robinson's congregation, who, with their pastor, had long resolved on removing to America, sailed from Holland for that country, and established a colony at Plymouth in Massachusetts. At this time commenced the settlement of New England. \u2014 A further account of the early emigrations to that country, and the progress of the adventurers, will be given in the history of New England. c"], [28, "12 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. In the year 1627, a colony of Swedes landed in America, and purchased from the natives all the land from Cape Henlopen, at the mouth of Delaware Bay, to the falls on the Delaware on both sides of that river, a distance of more than 70 miles. On this river, which they named New Swedeland Stream, they formed set tlements, and built several forts. In March, 1628, Sir Henry Roswell, and others, pur chased from the New England council a considerable tract of land, lying round Massachusetts Bay. Four months after, Captain Endicot, his wife, and several other persons, arrived in the country, and settled at Naumkeag ,- now the flourishing town of Salem, fifteen miles from Boston. This was the first English settlement made in Massachusetts. In the year 1633, Lord Baltimore, a Roman catholic nobleman, obtained from King Charles I. a grant of land on the Bay of Chesapeak, one hundred and forty miles in length, and one hundred and thirty in breadth. In a short time after this, the severity of the English laws against Roman Catholics, compelled a number of them with Lord Baltimore at their head, to take refuge in his lordship's new possession ; which, in honour of Charles's Queen, Henrietta Maria, they called Maryland. In 1630, the council ofthe Plymouth Company, made the first grant of Connecticut to Robert Earl of Warwick; who, the year following, transferred his grant to Lord Brook, Lord Say and Sele, and several others. These patentees afterwards made several grants to different persons, in consequence of which Mr. Fenwick, in 1634, formed a settlement at the mouth of Connecticut River, thirty-seven miles from the present city of Hartford. Here he built a fort, and called the place Saybrook, which name it still retains. In October of the following year, a considerable number of persons came from Mas- W.. _f fi I?7' themselves at Hartford, Wethersfield and Windsor, on the same river. Thu commenced the English settlement of Connecticut."], [29, "13 EARLY SETTLEMENTS Rhode Island was first settled from the province of Massachusetts ; and this settlement arose from religious persecution. Mr. Roger Williams, a clergyman, who had fixed at Salem in 1630, differing in opinion with some of his brethren, was charged with holding dangerous senti- ments, and unjustly banished from the colony. In 1635, Mr. Williams, accompanied by twenty other persons, fixed at the Indian town of Mooshausick, near the head of Narraganset-bay, and called the place Providence, the name which it still bears. From this small beginning has arisen the present interesting state of Rhode Island. New Jersey was in part settled by Dutch emigrants from New York, as early as the year 1615. Twelve years afterwards, a number of Swedes and Finns settled on both sides the River Delaware, and with the Dutch kept possession ofthe country for many years. In 166*, James Duke of York, brother to King Charles II. ob tained a grant of what is now called New Jersey, which then formed a part ofthe extensive territory named New Netherlands. In the year 1662, the Earl of Clarendon and seven other persons, obtained from Charles II. nearly the whole of the present states of North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia. In 1664, the king granted them a new charter, enlarging their boundaries, and investing them with power to form a code of laws for their new posses sion. In 1667, an endeavour to establish a settlement in this country proved wholly unsuccessful ; and no fur ther attempt was made until two years afterwards, when WilliamSayle was appointed first governor, and established a colony on a neck of land between Ashley and Cooper Rivers, the very spot where Charleston now stands. Thus commenced the settlement of Carolina. In 16S1, William Penn, son ofthe celebrated Admiral Penn, obtained a grant of Pennsylvania from Charles II. The year following, he embarked with a colony from England, wliich he fixed at Chester, fifteen miles from Philadelphia, where the first assembly in the province of c 2"], [30, "14 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. Pennsylvania was held on the 4th of December, 1682. Mr. Penn officiated as governor for nearly two years, and was succeeded by Thomas Lloyd, as president. Thus William Penn, a Quaker by profession, had the distin guished honour of laying the foundation of the present populous and very flourishing state of Pennsylvania. The government of Carolina, as vested in the original proprietors, continued for fifty years from its establishment in 1669. During this period, the colonists were con tinually involved in disputes and dissensions of so serious a nature, that in 1719 the British Parliament took the province under its own direction ; and in 1728, the pro prietors, with the exception of Lord Granville, received .=\u00a322,500 for the property and legal authority of the country. His Lordship's share, which formed a part of the present state of North Carolina, amounted to one eighth of the whole territory originally granted, and re mained vested in his family until the revolution in 1776 separated the British Colonies from the mother country. In 1729, the extensive region conveyed by the royal charter to Lord Clarendon and his partners, was divided into North and South Carolina; which remained separate governments under the crown until they became inde pendent states. In 1732, a number of humane and public spirited individuals in Great Britain, formed a plan for establishing a colony between the Rivers Savannah and Altamaha, with a view to the relief of many poor people of Britain and Ireland, and for better securing the possession of Carolina. Having procured a patent from George II. who was friendly to the plan, in honour of the King, they named the province Georgia. In November of that year, General Oglethorpe, with 114 persons, sailed for Georgia, and landed at a place called Yamacraw. In traversing the country, they found an agreeable spot of ground, upon an elevated situation, near the banks of a navigable river. Here they laid the foundation of a town, which, from the Indian name of the river, they called"], [31, "EARLY SETTLEMENTS. 15 Savannah. From this period may be dated the set tlement of Georgia. That portion of country called Vermont, before the revolutionary war, was claimed by the adjoining states of New Hampshire and New York. But the Green Moun tain Boys, as the martial inhabitants were then called, wishing it to become an independent state, took a most active part in the war ; and from the year 1777 may bs considered as possessing a separate jurisdiction and distinct government. But it was not until 1791 that their claim of independence was allowed by congress, when they were admitted, a fourteenth state, into the Union. That extensive region lying north-west of the river Ohio, within the limits of the United States, and con taining 411,000 square miles, equal to 220,000,000 of acres, was, by an act of congress passed in 1797\u00bb erected into one district, for the purpose of temporary govern ment ; but subject to division when circumstances should render it necessary. It has since been divided into states and territories : a description of each will be found under their respective heads.

The states which constituted the American republic on the ratification of the treaty of peace with Great Britain, in September, 1783, were the following : \u2014 New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Mary land, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia. \u2014 These states, in their fullest extent, comprise eighteen degrees of latitude, and thirty-three degrees of longitude ; beinsj about 1250 miles in length, and iOlO in breadth : reaching from 31 deg. to 49 deg. north, and from 51 deg. to 8t deg. west from Greenwich. \u2014 But as the Americans had at that time fixed their meridian at Philadelphia, the extent and longitude from that city is from 8 deg. east to 24 deg. west. \u2014 Since the removal of congress from Philadelphia to Washington, in the year 1 800, the meridian of the United States has been fixed at the latter city. The principal geographer to the American Government has computed, that the surface contained within the boundaries so described, is 1,000,000 of square miles, which comprehends V)U? millions of acres ; and he com putes that of these, fifty-one millions are water, or about _-25ths of the whole \u2014 The land, therefore, within the United States at their separation from the mother country, amounted to 589 millions of acres ; about 3-5ths of which is comprised in the thirteen original states ; the remaining 220 millions, which lie west of the northern and middle states, and north-west of the river Ohio, extending to the Mississippi River, with an extensive region south of the Ohio, originally ceded to the Union by North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, were intended by congress to be divided into"], [33, "17 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. ten new states ; to be called Washington, Mesopotamia, Pesilippi, Michigania, Illinois, Chersonese, Saratoga, Sylvama, Assenipi, and Polopotamia. At the present time (1818) the United States, in which is included the whole of Louisiana as it existed under France and Spain, extends from east to west 2700 miles, and from north to south 1650; comprehending an area of 2,379,350 square miles, or 1,522,78 1,000 acres. \u2014 The population of the last census, 1810, was 7,239,903; heing less than three persons to each square mile of territory, so that to every inhabitant there is nearly 200 acres of land. But to enable the reader, at one view, to form a correct judgment upon this import ant branch of political economy, the following table is subjoined : \u2014 America. Inhab. per sqr. mile. Europe. Inhab. per sqr. mile. Connecticut, 60 Italy, 222 Massachusetts, 54 England, 181 New York. 18 France, 174 Pennsylvania, 16 Ireland, 156 Virginia, J 4 Spain, 72 Louisiana, under 2 Scotland 63 It appears from the foregoing statement, that were the whole of the United States only as well inhabited as Pennsylvania, they would contain above thirty-eight mil lions of people ; with a population equal to Connecticut, nearly 143 millions; equal to England, upwards of 430 millions ; and equal to Italy, they would contain more than 528 millions of human beings. Supposing the population to increase in the small ratio as it has done during the last hundred years, the result would be nearly as follows : \u2014 Population. Population.

Situation and Boundaries.\u2014 The United States are situated between 25 deg. 50 min. and 49 deg. 37 min. north latitude ; and between 10 deg. east, and 48 deg. 20 min. west longitude from the city of Washington. \u2014 They are bounded on the east by the Atlantic Ocean and the British province of New Brunswick ; on the north, by Lower and Upper Canada, and the large un settled country to the westward of those provinces; on the west, by the Pacific Ocean ; on the south-west, by the Spanish internal provinces and the river Del Norte ; and on the south, by the gulfs of Mexico and Florida. Rivers and Lakes. \u2014 The head waters of the great river St. Lawrence are situated round lake Superior, which is navigable throughout its whole extent. \u2014 From this lake the water flows through the straits of St. Mary into lake Huron, from whence it issues, by the straits of that name, about forty miles in length, when it again expands itself into a beautiful lake, called St. Clare. \u2014 From lake St. Clare the river falls into lake Erie, by the straits of Detroit, a passage of about thirty miles in ex tent. \u2014 At the east end of Erie, delightfully situated, stands the town of Buffalo on the one side, and fort Erie on the other ; and between them this vast body of water, from lakes Superior, Michigan, Huron, and Erie, issues as clear as crystal, and by a rapid course runs to wards lake Ontario, through the passage called the Niagara River. \u2014 About five miles below lake Erie, the stream is divided by Grand Island, below which is Navy Island ; here the river expands to a considerable breadth, immediately above the falls of Niagara, where it is three quarters of a mile wide. \u2014 This is probably the greatest cataract in the world, and well deserves the attention of the curious : as there are many readers who may hot have seen an account of this great natural curiosity, the following description of it is copied from a late traveller, of undoubted veracity. \" At fort Chippeway, three miles above the falls, the bed ofthe river becomes very rocky, and the waters are violently agitated by passing over successive rapids ; so"], [35, "19 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. that were a boat by any accident to be carried further down than Chippeway, nothing could prevent it from being dashed to pieces long before it could reach the falls. \u2014 With such astonishing violence do the waves break on the rocks, that the mere sight of them from the top of the banks makes the spectator shudder. \u2014 To go to this island, it is necessary to set off at some distance above Chippeway, where the current is even, and to keep ex- actly in the middle of the river, the whole way thither ; if the boats are suffered to get out of their course ever so little, either to the right or left, it would be impos- sible to stem the current, and bring them again into it ; they would be irresistibly carried toward the falls, and de- struction must inevitably follow. \u2014 In returning from the island, there is still more difficulty and danger than in going to it. \u2014 As the river approaches the falls, it forces its way among the rocks with redoubled impetuosity; at at last, coming to the brink of the tremendous precipice, it tumbles headlong to the bottom, without meeting with any interruption in its descent. \u2014 Just at the precipice the river takes a considerable bend to the right, and the line of the cataracts, instead of extending from bank to bank in the shortest direction, runs obliquely across ; so that the width of the river is not so great as that of the falls. \u2014 The most stupendous of these is that on the British side of the river, commonly called the Horse-shoe Fall, from its bearing some resemblance to the shape of a horse-shoe. \u2014 The height of this is only 142 feet, whereas the other two are each 160 feet high ; but to its inferior height it is indebted principally for its grandeur ; the precipice, and of course the bed of the river above it, being so much lower at the one side than at the other, by far the greater part of the water finds its way to the lower side, and rushes down with much more ve locity at that side than it does at the opposite, as the rapids above the precipice are strongest there. \u2014 It is from the centre of the Horse-shoe Fall that arises that prodigious cloud of mist, which may be seen at so great u"], [36, "20 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA a distance. The extent of this amazing fall can only be ascertained by the eye ; the general opinion of those who have most frequently viewed it, is, that it cannot be less than 600 yards in circumference. \u2014 The island which separates it from the next fall, is supposed to be about 350 yards wide ; the second fall is about five yards in breadth ; the next island about thirty yards ; and the third, known by the name of Fort Schloper Fall, from being situated towards the side of the river on which that fort stands, is judged to measure at least as much as the large island. The whole extent of the precipice, therefore, including the islands, is, according to this com putation, 1335 yards. \u2014 This is certainly not an exag gerated statement. \u2014 bome have supposed, that the line of the falls altogether exceeds an English mile. \u2014 The quantity of water carried down these falls is prodigious ; it will be found to amount to 670,255 tons per minute ! Below the falls of Niagara, the river runs with a very rapid course for nine miles, through a deep chasm. The land on each side lowers a little above the level of the river at Queenstown and Lewistown. From this point it is navigable to Lake Ontario, distant seven miles. The river issues from Lake Ontario through a great number of islands, situated between Kingston and Sackett's Har bour. It now assumes the name of St. Lawrence ; though it is frequently known, from the lake to Montreal, by the name of Cadaraqui. In its progress, at the dis tance of 150 miles from Kingston, it expands into a con siderable lake called St. Francis, and soon after reaches the British settlement of Montreal, where it receives the Utawas, or Grand River, which forins the boundary be tween the two Canadas. Below Montreal it receives the Richelieu, or Sorel River, from Lake Champlain, and successively the St. Francis, St. Maurice, and Chaudiere. A short distance below the last-mentioned river stands the important city of Quebec. Here the river, though 400 miles from the sea, is five or six miles wide, and a hundred feet deep ; below Quebec it is divided"], [37, "21 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. into two branches by the Island of Orleans, which is twenty-five miles in length, and six in breadth, the river on each side being about two miles wide. Beyond this island it gradually expands into the spacious Bay and Gulf of St. Lawrence, and 3/0 miles below Orleans, and 743 from lake Ontario, falls into the Atlantic Ocean, by a mouth ninety miles in breadth. Columbia river, which falls into the Pacific Ocean, was first discovered by M'Kenzie, the enterprising Brit ish traveller, in north latitude 54 deg. 40 min. west long itude from London 120 deg. lb min. from which point he descended it about 150 miles; when leaving it, he crossed over to the ocean. From the place where M'Kenzie left it, the course is unknown till we approach Clark's river, where it is a stream of great magnitude. About seventy miles below Clarke's River, after receiving some tributary streams, the Columbia forms a junction with Lewis's River, a stream composed of numerous branches rising in the rocky mountains, where, like Clarke's River, they interlock with the head waters of the Mis souri. Below Lewis's River, the Columbia makes a bend to the south and east, and then passes through the moun tains ; about 300 miles below are the great falls ; twenty miles below the falls the river makes a considerable bend, and passes through another chain of mountains, below which, about sixty miles, it receives from the south-east the large and important river, called the Multnomah. This river is supposed to rise near the head waters of the Rio del Norte. 'Ihe waters of the Columbia are clear, and abound with fish of every variety. Rio del Norte. \u2014 This river rises among the moun tains between north lat. 44 deg. and 42 deg. and west long. 33 deg. and 31 deg. Its head waters interlock with those of the Missouri, Columbia, La Plate, Ark ansas, Multnomah, and Francisco ; and the waters of the Rio Colorado of the west, which fall into the Gulf of California, approach near it. For 300 miles from its source it forms the south-west boundary of Louisiana. About 100 miles below this is Santa Fe, one of the most"], [38, "22 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. interesting of the Spanish settlements. Below Santa Fe the river runs about 450 miles in a direction east of south, without receiving any material augmentation, when the Rio Conchos falls into it from the south-west. At a short distance from hence it makes a remarkable bend of about 100 miles, and receives the Rio Puerco from the north. At the Rio Puerco, the Rio del Norte again be comes the south-west boundary of Louisiana. Below this it runs an easterly course of between fifty and sixty miles, when it receives a considerable stream from the north, and from hence, without receiving any material addition, it holds a course nearly south-east, about 400 miles, to the Gulf of Mexico. Having thus described the rivers forming the outskirts, as it were, of the United States' Territory, it now re mains to take a view of the Missouri and Mississippi, with their numerous branches which water the interior. The Missouri, when traced to its highest source, is found a little above the 4. deg. of north latitude, and near the 35 deg. of west longitude, 3000 miles from the Mississippi ; it is here enclosed by very lofty mountains. Tracing the river downward from this point, we find that it bends considerably to the northward, the great falls being in north lat. 47 deg. 3 min. distant from the mouth of the river 2575 miles. From the source to these falls it receives eight considerable rivers. Here the Missouri descends 365 feet in the course of eighteen miles, the falls being partly perpendicular pitches and partly rapids; the highest pitch is eighty-seven feet, the next 47, and the next 26 : other inferior descents make up the quantity above mentioned. Below the falls, in a course of about 300 miles, it receives fourteen rivers, some of them of considerable magnitude. In north lat. 47 deg. 21 min. it forms a junction with another river nearly as large as itself, and it is here 372 yards broad. In lat. 47 deg. 2270 miles from its outlet, it is clear and beautiful, and 300 yards wide. About 380 miles further down, it is 527 yards wide ; its current deep, rapid, and full of sand bars. From thence to the"], [39, "23 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. end of its course the navigation is very good, the current being deep and rapid, and the water muddy. Its breadth various, from 800 to 800 yards ; and at its junction with the Mississippi, a few miles above St. Louis, in lat. 3S deg. 45 min. it is about 700 yards broad. Mississippi River. \u2014 This noble river, which has been emphatically termed the Nile of America, though it is, in tact, much larger than that river, rises in Turtle Lake, north lat. 47 deg. 47 min. and after receiving a number of tributary streams, reaches the falls of St. Anthony in lat. 44 deg. north, where it is little more than 100 yards wide. These falls are sixteen feet perpendicular, with a rapid below of fifty-eight feet. At a short distance from the falls, St. Peter's river forms a junction with the Mississippi from the west, and a little below, the river St. Croix falls in from the east. About fifteen miles further down, the river spreads out into a beautiful sheet of water called Lake Pepin ; at the lower end of which it receives the waters of Chippeway river. Ninety miles below the Chippeway, and in north lat. 42 deg. it is joined by the Ouiscons-'n. This river is highly import ant, as it approaches within two miles of Fox river, which falls into Lake Michigan. In lat. 39 deg. the Mis sissippi is joined by the Illinois river from the east, and twelve miles below the Missouri from the west ; being; the main branch of the river we are describing, and by far the longest, having been navigated nearly 3000 miles. The waters above this are clear, but the Missouri is a muddy stream, and imparts its colour to the Mississippi. In lat. 37 deg. and about 190 miles below the mouth of the Missouri, the beautiful Ohio joins the Mississippi, of which it is the great eastern branch, as the Missouri is the western. About 350 miles below the Ohio, the White river falls in from the westward. Fourteen miles below the White river, the Arkansas pours in from the westward also. This is a very large and important river, having its sources in the mountains above Santa Fe. Below the Arkansas river, 190 miles, the Yazoo falls in from the eastward. The Black River likewise flows in the"], [40, "24 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, same direction, and joins the Mississippi sixty-three miles by water, but only thirty in a direct line by land, below the Yazoo. The river now flows through a most interesting country, which will become the seat of great and important settlements, having Natchez, fifty-six miles from the Yazoo, for a central point, and about the same distance further down is Loftus Heights and Fort Adams. A short distance from this we pass the 31st degree of north lat. which forms the boundary between the states of Louisiana and Mississippi ; after which the river makes a remarkable bend to the west- ward, and receives the waters of Red River eighteen miles below Fort Adams. The junction of this river with the Mississippi is very singular. It would appear that they had been originally separate and distinct waters ; the Mississippi passing to the sea by New Or leans, and the Red River through the river Atchafalaya. But in one of these numerous bends which the Missis- sippi has formed, it appears to have broken into the bed of the Red River, and they have made a temporary junc tion, but again receded, and resumed their original course towards the ocean. As the Mississippi receives no streams of importance after passing the Atchafalaya, which is indeed a continuation of Red River, it may be considered as having reached its greatest magnitude ; ancl we may view it in its progress to the Gulf of Mexico, as being an average breadth of 800 yards ; the depth about 120 feet, and the mean volocity one mile an hour. Thus it flows on with majestic grandeur, and 210 miles below the Atchafalaya reaches New Orleans, where it makes a considerable bend to the south and east. Sixteen miles below the city the river makes another extraordinary bend, called the English Turn,* * In the early settlement of Louisiana by the French, the English government sent out a small squadron for the purpose of exploring the Mississippi. The squad ron succeeded in finding the mouth, and ascending the river to the bend now in question. A French officer met the ships, and had the address to persuade the English commander that the stream that he was then upon was not the great Ca nadian River, as it was then called, but another of far less importance ; and that the object of his search was farther westward. In consequence of this informa tion, the British officer quitted the Mississippi, and went in search of it to th* west ; then finally abandoned tbe enterprize, and returned to Europe."], [41, "25 UNITED STATES OF AMERIGA. after passing which, the next place deserving notice is Fort St. Philip, or Placquemines, distant fifty-four miles. From hence to the mouth of the river the distance is thirty-two miles. Some scattered clumps of trees are found, but the general surface of the little iand that rises above the water is a mere swamp. The aspect of the country is lifeless and dreary, and even the low grass-constructed cabins of the fishermen contribute to the melancholy appearance of the scene. The whole length of this mighty river is upwards of 2,600 miles, and its communication with the sea is by six outlets ; namely, the west, south-west, south, main, or north-east north, and Pass a la Loutre. The eastern extremity of the waters of this river is the head waters of the Alle gany, which are situated in Pennsylvania, about 190 miles north-west of Philadelphia. \u2014 The western extre mity is the head waters of Jefferson's river, about 540 miles from the Pacific ocean : the distance between these two extremities, in a direct line, is 1,700 miles. \u2014 The northern extremity is a branch of Missouri, in north lat. 50 deg. 42 min. 550 miles west by north of the Lake of the Woods. The southern extremity is the south pass into the Gulf of Mexico ; north latitude 29 deg. 100 miles below New Orleans : the distance between these two extremities, in a direct line, is 1,680 miles. \u2014 Thus the river and its branches spread over nearly fifteen hun dred thousand square miles, viz. \u2014 Missouri Territory, two-thirds, 1,060,000 North-west Territory, one-half, 73,500 Illinois Territory, the whole, 50,000 Indiana, nineteen-twentieths, 32,300 Ohio, four-fifths 31,200 Pennsylvania, one-third, 14^00 New York, one-hundredth, 460 Maryland, ditto, 1 10 Virginia, two-fifths, 25.600 North Carolina, one-fiftieth, 900 South Carolina, one- 150th, 190 Georgia, one-hundredth, 580 Kentucky, the whole, 39,000 Tennessee, ditto, 40,000 Mississippi, three-fifths, 29,660 Louisiana, two-thirds, 32,000 1,429,700"], [42, "26 UNITED STATES 01- AMERICA. So that the Mississippi and its branches water conside rably more than two-thirds ofthe United States territory; a great portion of it being still unsettled, and probably the finest land in the world. The United States seem to have been formed by nature for the most intimate union ; no part of the world being so well watered with springs, rivers, rivulets, and lakes. \u2014 By means of these various streams and bodies of water, the whole country is chequered into islands and peninsulas. \u2014 The facilities of navigation render the communication between the ports of Georgia and New Hampshire far more expeditious and practicable, than between those of Provence and Picardy in France, Gallicia and Catalonia in Spain, or Cornwall and Caithness in Great Britian. \u2014 The canals opening between the Rivers Susquehanna and Delaware, between Pas quetank and Elizabeth Rivers in Virginia, and between the Schuylkill and Susquehanna, will form a communi cation from the Carolinas to the western counties of of Pennsylvania, and New York. \u2014 The improvement of the River Potomac will give a passage from the southern states to the western parts of Virginia, Mary land, Pennsylvania, and even to the great northern lakes. \u2014 From the Town of Detroit, on Lake Erie, to Alex andria in the district of Columbia, a distance of 560 mile'R, are only two carrying places, which together do not exceed forty miles. \u2014 The canals of Delaware and Chesapeak will open the navigation from South Carolina to New Jersey ; Delaware, the most populous parts of Pennsylvania, and the midland counties of New York. \u2014 Other ganals are also now cutting in Massachusetts and New Hampshire, and one between Ashley and Cooper Rivers in South Carolina. After what has been done the las! twenty years, it cannot be venturous to predict, that thirty years more will not elapse before a water com munication will extend from Lake Erie to New Orleans. There is nothing in other parts of the globe, which re sembles the prodigious chain of lakes in North America. \u2014 They may properly be termed inland seas of fresh water,"], [43, "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 27 for even those of the second or third class in magnitude are of greater circuit than the largest lake in the eastern continent. The nine great lakes to be described in this place, are, the Lake-of-the- Woods, Long Lake, Lakes Su perior, Huron, St. Clair, Erie, Ontario, Champlain, and Michigan ; through the first eight of these is drawn the boundary line which separates the United States from the British provinces : the last lies entirely within the terri tory of the United States. \u2014 The lakes of minor impor tance will be noticed in the description of the states to which they respectively belong. The Lake-irf-the-Woods, so called from a large quan tity of wood growing on its banks, lies in 49 deg. 37 min. north lat. and 94 deg. 51 min. west long, from London. This lake forms the communication between Lakes Win nipeck, Bourbon, and Superior, and is the source of one branch of the River Bourbon. Its length from east to west is about seventy miles, and in some places it is forty miles wide. The Killistinoe Indians encamp on its borders to fish and to pursue game. Long Lake lies east of the Lake-of-the-Woods, and is nearly a hundred miles long, and in no part more than twenty miles wide. Eastward of this lake lie several small ones, which extend in a line to the great carrying place, and thence into Lake Superior. Between these little Lakes are several portages, which render the trade to the north-west very difficult, and exceedingly tedious; as it requires no less than two years to perform one voyage from Michilimackinac, on Lake Erie, to these parts. Lake Superior is so named from its vast magnitude, being upwards of 1500 miles in circumference, and is supposed to be the greatest body of fresh water in the world. A considerable part of the coast is bounded by rocks and broken ground, and the water of the lake, which is pure and transparent, appears to lie upon a bed of huge rocks. From the most accurate observations yet made, the situation of this lake lies between 46 deg. and no. 2 E"], [44, "2S UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 50 deg. north lat. and between 9 deg. and 16 deg. west long, from Washington. It contains many large islands, two of which have each land enough, if proper for cul tivation, to form a considerable province ; especially Isle Royal, which is not less than a hundred miles long, and in many places forty broad. \u2014 Storms affect this lake as much as they do the Atlantic Ocean ; the waves run as high, and the navigation is equally dangerous. It dis charges its waters from the south-east corner through the Straits of St. Mary, as already noticed, page 18 ; but though it is supplied by near forty rivers, many of which are large, yet it does not appear that one-tenth part of the waters conveyed into it by these rivers is discharged by the above-mentioned strait. Lake Huron, into wliich you enter by the Straits of St. Mary, is next in magnitude to Lake Superior. It lies between 42 deg. and 46 deg. north lat. and between 4 deg. and S deg. west long, in shape it is nearly trian gular, and its circumference about 1000 miles. On the north side of this lake is an island 100 miles in length, and no more than eight in breadth ; it is called Mona taulin, signifying a place of spirits, and is considered as sacred by the native Indians. About the middle of the south-west side of the lake is Saganaum Bay, about eighty miles in length, and twenty broad. Thunder Bay, so called from the continual thunder heard there, lies about half-way between Saganaum Bay, and the north west corner of the lake : it is about nine miles across either way. Lake St. Clair lies about half way between Lakes Huron and Erie, and is about ninety miles in circum ference. It receives the waters of the three great Lakes, Superior, Michigan, and Huron, and discharges them through the River or Strait called Detroit, as before ob served, into Lake Erie. It is of a circular form, and navigable for large vessels, except a bar of sand towards the middle, which prevents loaded vessels from passing. The cargoes of such as are freighted must be taken out, carried across the bar in boats, and re-shipped."], [45, "29 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. Lake Erie is situated between 41 deg. and 43 deg. north lat. and between 3 deg. and 6 deg. west Ion. It is nearly 300 miles long ; opposite Cleveland, in the state of Ohio, it is about sixty miles broad, to the east ward it is above seventy. The average breadth is from fifty to sixty miles ; and its medium depth forty to 120 feet. The water is pure and wholesome, and abounds with fish : such as sturgeon, white fish, trout, perch, &c. The lake does not freeze in the middle, but is frequently frozen on both sides ; and sometimes in winter, when the wind is variable, the ice exhibits a singular phenomenon ; a south wind blows it all to the Canada shore, and a north wind again dislodges it, and brings it back to the American side. There are a number of islands in the west end of the lake, containing from 800 to 2000 acres of land, and the scenery amongst them is charming ; but all these islands are so dreadfully infested with ser pents, and on some of them rattle-snakes are so numer ous, that in the height of summer it is really dangerous to land. This and the other lakes are navigated by ves sels of from seventy to eighty tons, which carry goods as far as the head of Lake Superior, and bring back furs and peltry. The navigation is good through the whole distance, except in Lake St. Clair, where the water is shallow, and vessels are sometimes obliged to lighten. The principal ports on the American side of Lake Erie are Michilimackinac, Detroit, Miami, Sandusky, Caya hoga, Grand River, Presque Isle, and Buffalo. On the British side, Maiden, Moyes, Sandwich.and St. Joseph's. Lake Ontario is situated between 43 deg. 45 min. of north lat. and 0 deg. and 3 deg. west Ion. Jt is about 200 miles in length and 40 in width ; its form nearly oval, and its circumference about 600 miles. It abounds with fish of an excellent flavour, among which are the Oswego bass, weighing three or four pounds. Near the south-east part it receives the waters of the Oswego River, and on the north-east it discharges itself into the River Cataraque, or now as it is properly called Iroquois. This"], [46, "30 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. river at Kingston, takes the name of St. Lawrence, as described in page 20. Lake Champlain lies between the states of New York and Vermont, and communicates with Lower Canada by the River Sorel, which falls into the River St. Lawrence forty-five miles below Montreal. It is about 120 miles in length, and of various breadths : for the first thirty miles, that is, from South River to Crown Point, it is no where above two miles wide ; beyond this, for the dis tance of twelve miles, it is five or six miles across, it then narrows, and again at the end of a few miles, expands. That part called the Broad Lake (because broader than any other) commences about twenty-five miles north of Crown Point, and is eighteen miles across in the widest part. Here the lake is interspersed with a great number of islands, the largest of which, named South Hero, is fifteen miles in length, and averages four in breadth. The soil of this island is very fertile, and more than 700 people are settled upon it. The Broad Lake is nearly fifty miles in length, and gradually narrows till it termin ates in the River Sorel. Lake Champlain, exceptthenar row parts at either end, is in general very deep ; in many places sixty and seventy, and in some even 100, fathoms. Lake Michigan is 270 miles long by 70 broad. The navigation of this lake is good ; but its connection with Lake Huron, by the straits of Michilimackinac, is shal low and difficult. Lake Michigan penetrates the state of Indiana, and near its southern extremity receives the River Calumet, and a little from its south-east end, the small River St. Joseph enters from the same state, but falls into this lake lower down in Michigan territory. The most considerable bays on the east side of this lake are those of Sable and Grand Traverse : the last is about twelve miles long and four or five broad. There are no settlements of whites of any considerable consequence yet formed upon either of its banks or tribu tary rivers. Most of the lands that border this fine lake are still the property of the native Indians."], [47, "31 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. These lakes admit of the most extensive inland navi gation in the world. The different stages of it upwards from Cleveland, on Lake Erie, to Lake Superior, New Orleans, and the River Ohio ; and downards to the Gulf of St. Lawrence, above 300 miles below Quebec, may be stated as follows : to Sandusky Bay, 57 miles ; thence to Miama Bay, 45; to Maiden, 45 ; to Detroit, 18 ; to Lake St. Clair, 1 1 ; through the said lake, 40 ; through Huron River, 40 ; through Lake Huron to the Straits of Michilimackinac, 190; thence to Lake Superior, 100; and through the said lake upwards of 300 ; being, in that direction, about 836 miles. Then Lake Michigan is -navigable, from the straits downwards, 300 miles ; and from thence there are only two portages to the River Mississippi, after passing which, there is a complete navi gation to New Orleans. From Lake Erie, there are four portages to the River Ohio ; the first of only seven or eight miles between the Cayahoga, which flows into the lake at Cleveland, and the Musingum that falls into the Ohio 160 miles below Pittsburgh. The others are through the Miami-of-the-Lakes and the Wabash ; through San dusky River and the Great Miami, and from Presque Isle to French creek, a branch of the Allegany. \u2014 The navigation downwards is by the following stages : \u2014 To Grand River, 30 miles ; to Presque Isle, 70 ; to Buffalo 100 ; to Fort Schloper, 20 ; from thence the portage round the falls of Niagara is ten miles to Lewistown ; thence the navigation is continued to Lake Ontario, seven miles; through that lake to Kingston, at the north eastern extremity of the lake, 170 ; to Montreal, 170 ; to Quebec, 170 ; and thence to the Gulf of St. Lawrence, 320 miles ; in all, 1068 miles. Bays. \u2014 Commencing ,at the north-east and pro ceeding to the south-west, the first in order is the Bay or Gulf of St. Lawrence, nearly 100 miles wide at its entrance. The next is Chebucto Bay, in Nova Scotia, rendered remarkable by the loss of a French fleet, in a former war between Great Britain and France. The"], [48, "32 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. Bay of Fundy, between Nova Scotia and the New Eng- land States, distinguished by its extraordinary tides, which rise to the height of fifty or sixty feet, and flow so rapidly as sometimes to overtake animals feeding upon the shore. Penobscot, Broad, and Casco Bays, lie along the coast of the district of Maine. Massachusetts Bay spreads eastward of Boston, and is comprehended between Cape Ann on the north, and Cape Cod on the south. Passing by Narraganset and some other bays in the state of Rhode Island, we enter Long Island sound. This sound is a kind of inland sea, from tliree to twenty-five miles broad, and about 140 miles long, dividing Long Island from the state of Connecticut. It communicates with the ocean at both ends of the island, and affords a very safe inland navigation. The celebrated passage called Hell Gate is situated near the west end of this sound, about eight miles from the city of New York. It is a very singular strait, about three or four hundred yards in breadth, having a ledge of sunken rocks across it in an angular direction, which occasions many whirl pools and cross currents in the water. Delaware Bay is seventy miles long, and twenty-five wide at its outlet. It opens into the Atlantic, north-west and south-east between Cape Henlopen on the right, and Cape May on the left. The Chesapeak is one ofthe largest bays in the world. Its entrance is between Cape Charles and Cape Henry in Virginia, twelve miles wide, and it extends 270 miles to the northward, dividing Virginia and Maryland. It is from seven to eighteen miles broad, and generally nine fathoms deep ; affording many commodious harbours, and a safe and easy navigation. It receives the waters of the Potomac, Rappahannok, York, and James River, which are all large and navigable. There are several other bays in the western part of the United States, such as Mobile, St. Louis, &c. he. all of which will be de scribed with the districts wheiein they are situated. Mountains and Minerals. \u2014 The country east of Hudson's Bay, comprehending the part of the state of"], [49, "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 33 New York, with the whole of New Hampshire, Massa chusetts, Maine, Vermont, Rhode Island, and Connec ticut, is rough, hilly, and in some parts mountainous ; but the mountains are comparatively small, seldom rising more than 500 yards in height. Between the Atlantic Ocean, the Mississippi River, and the great northern lakes, runs a long range of mountains made up of a great number of ridges. These extend north-easterly and south-westerly, nearly parallel with the sea-coast, about 1200 miles in length, and 150 in breadth : the different ridges which compose this immense range have different names in different states. Advancing from the Atlantic the first ridge in Pennsylvania, Virginia, and North Carolina, is the Blue Ridge, or South Mountain, which is from 130 to 200 miles from the sea ; this is about 4000 feet high. The Blue Ridge is thickly covered with large trees to the very summit ; some of the mountains are rugged and .stony, others are not so ; and on the latter the soil is rich and fertile. The inhabitants of this ele vated district are uncommonly tall and powerful ; it be ing rare to see a man among them who is not six feet high ; and they entertain a high opinion of their own superiority in point of bodily strength over the people of the low country. Between this and the North mountain spreads a large fertile vale, thickly inhabited. The cli mate is good, and the people have a healthy and robust appearance. Several valuable mines of iron and copper have been discovered here, and are now working to con siderable advantage. Next to this vale lies the Allegany ridge, the greatest of all the chain of mountains, and em phatically termed the Back-bone of America. The road over this ridge is extremely uneven and covered with enormous stones. Beyond this is the long ridge, called the Laurel Mountains, in a part of which, about 36 deg. lat. is a spring of water fifty feet deep, very cold, and as blue as indigo. The direction of this ridge is parallel with the others ; the woods which cover it are more tufted, and the vegetation appears more lively : the de scent on its western side is extremely steep and difficult."], [50, "34 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. From these several ridges proceed innumerable branches or spurs, without any names to distinguish one from the other. The Kittatinny mountains, which form a part of the Blue Ridge, run through the northern parts of New Jersey and Pennsylvania. The general term for all these mountains, taken collectively, is the Allegany ; that being the name of the principal ridge. Minerals are found in great variety and profusion throughout the United States. Iron, limestone, and freestone, abound in all parts of the country. Iron mines are worked with great success among theAlleganies, and the metal derived from them is of an excellent qua lity. Coal is very abundant in the western states, and has been found in several places on the Atlantic. Lead is raised in great quantities in the Missouri territory, particularly in the neighbourhood of St. Louis, where the mines are very valuable and of vast extent ; and it is confidently believed that gold and silver exist in great quantities in the same distrct. Copper mines have been discovered in various places, and several of them are very productive. Marble is a most abundant article, especially in Missouri territory, where it extends above 300 miles under the White River, already noticed, page 23. On ondago county in the state of New York, abounds with two of the most useful minerals in nature, salt and gyp sum, or plaster of Paris ; both of which are become im portant objects of commerce. Also in the states of Vir ginia, Ohio, Louisiana, &c. salt is manufactured to a great extent ; indeed the whole western country is cele brated for salt springs. Antimony, that most essential article in working of metals, has been lately found, and can be raised in any quantity. That there is a hidden store of mineral treasure of immense value, within the United States territory, there is not a doubt ; and the systematic plan now adopted for exploring thecountry and bringing it into view, will probably be attended with the most beneficial results. Climate. \u2014 The climate of America is distinguished from that of other countries by a predominance of cold,"], [51, "35 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. insomuch that many places which by their geographical position should be mild and temperate, and should produce all the fruits of the South of Europe, are exposed to long and rigorous winters, during which they lie buried under snow ; and those still further north, corresponding with countries in Europe which are the scenes of industry and improved cultivation, are almost uninhabitable, from the extreme rigour of the season. This is peculiarly the case with the inhospitable region of Labrador, which lies nearly opposite to Great Britain. Various causes have been suggested in order to account for this remarkable peculiarity of the.American continent, and of these, one of the most obvious is the general and prodigious eleva tion of the soil. Not only is its surface diversified, by immense regions of mountains covered with snow, but in many parts, as in New Mexico, extensive plains are to be found at the extraordinary elevation of from 6000 to 10,000 feet above the level of the sea ! It cannot be doubted that the air, cooled by its contact with these snowy summits, and afterwards circulated over the con tinent, must have a powerful effect in producing the superior degree of cold for which America is distinguished. The weather in the middle and southern states is ex tremely variable, the seasons of two succeeding years being seldom alike ; and it scarcely ever happens that a month passes over without great changes taking place. It has been remarked, that in Pennsylvania, nightly frosts have been discovered in every month ofthe year, excepting July ; and even in that month, during which the heat is always greater than at any other time, a cold day or two sometimes intervene, when a fire is found very agreeable. The climate of the state of New York is very similar to that of Pennsylvania, excepting that in the northern parts of that state, bordering upon Canada, the winters are always severe and long. The climate of New Jersey, Delaware, and the upward parts- of Maryland, is also much the same with that of Pennsylvania ; in the lower parts of Maryland, the climate does not differ materially F"], [52, "36 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. from that of Virginia to the eastward of the Blue Ridge. The moisture of the air varies very much in different parts of the country ; it also varies in all parts with the winds : and it is surprising to find what a much greater degree of heat can be borne without inconvenience when the air is dry than when it is moist. In the New England states, in a remarkable dry air, the heat is not found more insupportable when the thermometer stands at 100 deg. than it is in the lower parts of the southern states, where the air is moist, when the thermometer stands perhaps at at 90 deg. \u2014 that is, supposing the wind to be in the same quarter in both places. But throughout all the states, the difference is very great between the climate among the hills, and that in the low country. From the moun tains in New England, along the different ridges which run through New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and the Southern states, even to the extre mity of Georgia, the heat is never found very oppressive ; whilst as far north as Pennsylvania and New York, the heat in the lower parts of the country, between the mountains and the ocean, is frequently intolerable. In every part of the United States, the wind makes a pro digious difference in the temperature of the air. When the north-west wind blows, the heat is always found more tolerable than with any other ; although the ther mometer should be at the same height. This wind is uncommonly dry, and brings with it fresh animation and vigour to every living thing ; and although it is very piercing in winter, the people never complain so much of cold as when the north-east wind blows ; nor is the air ever found so agreeable, at any season of the year, as with a north-west breeze. The north-east wind is also cold, but it renders the air raw and damp : that from the south-east is damp but warm. Rain or snow usually falls when the wind comes from any point towards the east. The south-west wind, like the north-west, is dry ; but it is generally attended with warm weather. When the wind blows from a southerly point, storms of thunder, lightning, hail, and rain, are common."], [53, "37 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. But it appears from atttentive observation, and judi- cious experiments, that in proportion to the increase of cultivation, the seasons become more moderate. Ever since the first settlement of North America, the severity of the cold has been found gradually to decrease. This change of the climate is evident by the great diminution cf snow in all the oldest cultivated parts of the country. The cold of the winters is also perceptibly decreasing : the rivers are not frozen so soon, so thick, or so long as they formerly were. At the first settlement of Phila- delphia, the River Delaware was commonly covered with ice about the end of November: it is not now frozen over until the first week in January. Similar observations have been made in regard to the ice in Hudson's River, state of New York ; and at Boston the extreme cold weather does not come on so soon as formerly by seve- ral weeks. The bays, instead of being annually covered with ice, are seldom frozen to that degree ; and they do not continue in this state a longer time than eight or ten days. Face ofthe Country. \u2014 Thegeneralaspect ofthe United States presents every variety of surface, the country being happily variegated with plains and mountains, hills and valleys. Some parts are rocky, particularly New England, the northern parts of New York and New Jersey, and a broad space, including the several ridges ofthe long range of mountains which runs south-westward through Penn- sylvania, Virginia, North Carolina, and a part of Georgia; dividing the waters which flow into the Atlantic ft om those which fall into the Mississippi. This mountainous district is about 150 miles, in breadth, and 1200 miles in length ; extending in large ridges from north-east to south-west. These ridges are generally known by the name of the Allegany Mountains, and are of various elevations, from 2000 to 4000 feet high : the highest point seems to be the White Hills in New Hampshire, which rise to the elevation of nearly 9000 feet. The north-eastern part of the United States, near the coast, is broken and hilly ; and is remarkably indented with"], [54, "38 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. numerous bays and inlets. Towards the sonth, and along the Uulf of Mexico, the land is level and sandy, inter spersed with many swamps, and a great number of islands. At the outlets of many of the rivers, there is a large portion of alluvial land, formerly covered by the water, which is particularly the case along the Mississippi. On the Atlantic side of the states, above the head of the tide waters, is a tolerably rich and agieeably uneven country, which extends to the mountains. Beyond the mountains we have a view of the great valley of the Mississippi and its tributary streams ; presenting a body of the finest land in the world, and possessing great natural advan tages. To the westward of this valley are the mountains of Louisiana, presenting features singularly bold and majestic. Beyond these, the principal feature is the great confluence of waters at the outlet of the Columbia River, and the bold shores of the Pacific Ocean. Native Indians. \u2014 The American Indians are distin guished by a very small forehead, covered with hair from the extremities to the middle of the eye-brows. They have black eyes, a thin nose, small and rather aquiline ; the face broad, the features somewhat coarse, the ears large, and placed far back ; their hair very black, lank, and coarse. Their limbs are small but well shaped, and scarcely any crooked or deformed person is to be found among them. They are of a middle stature, well pro portioned, strong and active, but not fitted for much labour. They are naturally of a copper colour ; but take a great deal of pains to darken their complexion by anointing themselves with grease, and lying in the sun. They also paint their faces, breasts, and shoulders of various colours, but generally red. There is little dif ference between the dress of the men and women, except ing a short petticoat, and the hair clubbed behind, dis tinguish some of the latter. Their warlike arms are guns, bows, and arrows, darts, scalping-knives, and tomahawks. This is one of their most useful pieces of held furniture, serving all the offices of the hatchet, nine, and sword. r r They live dispersed in small villages, either in the"], [55, "39 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. voods, or on the banks of rivers, where they have little jlantations of Indian corn and roots ; but not enough to mpply their families half the year : during the remainder bey subsist by hunting, fishing, and fowling, and the xuits of the earth, which grow spontaneously in great plenty. The Indians are a very understanding people, quick of apprehension, sudden in execution, exquisite in invention, and industrious in action. They are of a gentle and amiable disposition to those they think their friends, but. as implacable in their enmity ; their revenge being only completed in the entire destruction of their enemies. Among the Indians all men are equal, personal qualities being most esteemed ; and though there is perhaps less delicacy of sentiment in these people than amongst us, there is, however, much more honesty, with infinitely less ceremony, or equivocal compliments. Their public conferences shew them to be men of genius ; and they possess, in a high degree, the talent of natural eloquence. The celebrated oration of Logan, a chief of the Mingo tribe, to Lord Dunmore, when governor of Virginia, has been so often published, that it must now be familiar to most readers : but the following speeches of. a much more recent date, are, it is believed, but little known in this country. They were delivered at a council held at Buffalo, on Lake Erie, in May, 1811, by an Indian named Red Jacket, with such animation of gesture and force of language, as perfectly astonished the audience. To explain them it is necessary to state, that the Indians in that district, when they sold their lands, reserved about 200,000 acres for themselves and families to reside on. The pre-emption right, that is, the right to purchase from the Indians, was sold by the Holland Company to certain persons in New York, and they sent a Mr. Richardson as agent, to endeavour to make a bargain with the Indians. Along with this gentleman, the missionary society of New York sent a Mr. Alexander, with a view to convert the Seneca Indians to Christianity ; and these two gentlemen addressed them on the subject of their respective missions about the same time. Red jacket,"], [56, "40 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. who is called in his own nation Sagu-yu-whatta, which signifies Keeper Awake, in answer to Mr. Richardson, spoke as follows : \" Brother ; we opened our ears to the talk you lately delivered to us at our council-fire. In doing important business it is best not to tell long stories, but to come to it in a few words. We shall therefore not repeat your talk, which is fresh in our minds. We have well consi dered it, and the advantages and disadvantages of your offers. We request your attention to our answer, which is not from the speaker alone, but from all the sachems and chiefs now round our council-fire. \" Brother ; We know that great men, as well as great nations, have different interests, have different minds, and do not see the same subject in the same light ; but we hope our answer will be agreeable to you and to your employers. \" Brother ; Your application for the purchase of our lands, is to our minds very extraordinary ; it has been made in a crooked manner \u2014 you have not walked in the straight path pointed out by the great council of your nation. You have no writings from our great father the president. \" Brother ; In making up our minds we have looked back, and remembered how the Yorkers purchased our lands in former times. They bought them piece after piece for a little money, paid to a few men in our nation, and not to all our brethren. Our planting and hunting grounds have become very small, and if we sell these we know not where to spread our blankets. Brother ; You tell us your employers have purchased of the council of Yorkers a right to buy our lands \u2014 we do not understand how this can be \u2014 the lands do not belong to the Yorkers ; they are ours, and were given to us by the Great Spirit. \" Brother ; We think it strange that you should jump over the lands of our brethren in the east, to come to our council-fire so far off, to get our lands. When we sold our lands in the east to the white people, we determined"], [57, "41 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. never to sell those which we then reserved \u2014 they are as small as we can live comfortably on. \u2022\u2022 Brother ; You want us to travel with you, and look for other lands. If we should sell our lands and move off' into a distant country, towards the setting sun, we should be looked upon in the country to which we go as foreign ers and strangers, and be despised by the red as well as the white men ; and we should soon be surrounded by the white men, who would there also kill our game, come upon our lands, and again try to get them from us. V Brother ; We are determined not to sell our lands, but to continue on them \u2014 we like them \u2014 they are fruit ful, and produce us corn in abundance, for the support of our women and children, andgrass and herbsforour cattle. \" Brother ; At the treaties held for the purchase of our lands, the white men, with sweet voices and smiling faces, told us they loved us, and that they would not cheat us, but that the king's children on the other side of the lake would cheat us. When we go on the other side of the lake, the king's children tell us your people will cheat us ; but, with sweet voices and smilling faces, assure us of their love, and that they will not defraud us. These things puzzle our heads, and we believe that the Indians must take care of themselves, and not trust either in your people or in the king's children. \" Brother ; At a late council we requested our agents to tell you, that we would not sell our lands, and we think you have not spoken to our agents, or they would have informed you so, and we should not have met you at our council-fire at this time. Brother ; The white people buy and sell false rights to our lands, and your employers have, you say, paid a great price for their right \u2014 they must have plenty of money, to spend it in buying false rights to lands belonging to Indians. The loss of it will not hurt them, but our lands are of great value to us, and we wish you to go back with our talk to your employers, and to tell them and the Yorkers, that they have no right to buy and sell false rights to our lands."], [58, "42 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. \" Brother ; We hope you clearly understand all the words we have spoken. This is the whole of what we have to say. In answer to Mr. Alexander, the Christian Missionary Red Jacket addressed himself thus : \u2014 Brother ; We listened to the talk you delivered to us from the council of black coats* in New York. We have fully considered your talk, and the offers you have made us \u2014 we perfectly understand them, and we return an answer which we also wish you to undei stand. In making up our minds, we have looked back, and remembered what has been done in our days, and what our fathers have told us was done in old times. Brother ; Great numbers of black coats have been amongst the Indians, and with sweet voices and smiling faces, have offered to teach them the religion of the white people. Our brethren in the east listened to the black coats \u2014 turned from the religion of their forefathers, and took up the religion of the white people. What good has it done them ? Are they more happy and more friendly one to another than we are ? No, brother, they are a divided people \u2014 we are united \u2014 they quarrel about religion \u2014 we live i_* love and friendship \u2014 they drink strong water \u2014 have learned how to cheat \u2014 and to prac tice all the vices of the white men. \u2014 Brother, if you are our well-wisher, keep away, and do not disturb us. \" Brother ; We do not worship tne Great Spirit as the white men do ; for we believe that forms of worship are indifferent to the Great Spirit \u2014 it is the offering of a sincere heart that pleases him, and we worship him in this manner. According to your religion, we must believe in a Father and a Son, or we will not be happy hereafter. We have always believed in a Father, and we worship him as we were taught by our fathers. Your book says the Son was sent on earth by tbe Father \u2014 did all the people who saw the Son believe in him ? No, they did not ; and the consequences must be known to you, if you have read the book. \" Brother ; You wish us to change our religion for * The appellation given to clergymen by the Indians."], [59, "43 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. yours \u2014 we like our religion, and do not want another. Our friends, (pointing to Mr. Taylor and Mr. Parrish) do us great good \u2014 they counsel us in our troubles, and instruct us how to make ourselves comfortable. Our friends, the quakers, do more than this \u2014 they give us ploughs, and show us how to use them. They tell us we are accountable beings, but do not say we must change our religion \u2014 we are satisfied with what they do. \" Brother ; For these reasons we cannot receive your offers \u2014 we have other things to do, and beg you to make your mind easy, and not trouble us any more, lest our heads should be too much loaded, and by and by we should go distracted.\" Soil and productions, vegetable and animal. \u2014 In this vast extent of territory is to be found every species of soil which the earth affords, and equal to that of any country in the habitable globe. \u2014 In one part or the other is produced all the various kinds of fruit, grain, pulse, and garden plants and roots which are found in Europe, and have been thence transplanted to America ; and be sides these, a great variety of native vegetables. \u2014 On the Atlantic coast, to the north and east, the country is stony, and towards the south, sandy ; but in both cases it is interspersed with a great deal of excellent land. \u2014 Approaching the mountains the soil improves, and there are many situations extremely fertile : on the mountains, the soil is light and thin, but rich in the valleys between the ridges. Beyond the mountains, in the valleys of the Ohio, Mississippi, and Missouri, there are vast tracts uncommonly rich and fertile. Towards the south-western parts of the Missouri territory, the soil is light, thin, and sandy. The mountainous region to the north-west is pretty similar to the Allegany Mountains, but the hills are much more lofty, and the soil more variable. On the other side of these mountains, there is much good soil all the way to the Pacific Ocean. The produce of the United States consists of every variety in the known world ; among which may be noticed the following : Indian corn (or maize) is a native G"], [60, "44 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. grain of America, from whence all other countries have been supplied. It agrees with every climate from the equator to 45 deg. north ; but it flourishes best between the latitudes of 30 deg. and 40 deg. The bunched Guineacorn is asmall grain cultivated by the negroes in the southern states, and affords a fine food for poultry. The spiked Indian corn is of a similar kind. Rice was first introduced in the Carolinas in 1668, but it was little cul tivated until eight years afterwards, when a fresh supply was brought by a ship from Madagascar. Its culture is chiefly confined to North and South Carolinaand Georgia. Wild rice is the most valuable of all the spontaneous pro ductions of North America, and grows in profusion in some of the interior districts. Wheat, rye, barley, and oats are cultivated, with few exceptions, throughout all the states. In Pennsylvania is a kind of grain called spelts, which has much the appearance of wheat, and is excellent food for horses. The flour made from it is very white, and has often been mixed with wheat flour for bread. Potatoes are a native root ofthe American Continent, and have lately been discovered in a wild state, and in great quantities, on the banks of the La Plata and Chili. The culinary roots and plants are carrots, parsnips, turnips, radishes, beets, beans, peas, cabbages, cauli flowers, celery, lettuce, asparagus, leeks, onions, angelica, peppergrass, cucumbers, watermelons, muskmelons, can telopes, pumpkins, mandrakes, squashes, &c. &c. Besides these there are many other roots and plants of a medi cinal kind, such as elecampane or starwort, spikenard, sarsaparilla, ginseng, snakeroot, liquorice, solomon's-seal, devil's-bit horse-radish, gold thread, blood root, &c. &c. Apples are the most common fruit in the United States, and arrive at great perfection. In the eastern and middle states they are produced in the greatest plenty, and also in the interior of the country ; but in the maritime parts of the southern states, and in Louisiana, they do not thrive. Besides apples are pears, cherries, plums, grapes, peaches, apricots, quinces, nectarines, currants, goose berries, raspberries, strawberries, mulberries, blackberries,"], [61, "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 45 cranberries, whortleberries, bilberries, &c. The two first, south of 33 deg. north lat. become not worth the ground they occupy. Of the nuts are walnuts, chesnuts, hazle nuts, filberts, beechnuts, and Illinois nuts; the latter are to be found chiefly on the Illinois River. Figs, pome granates, oranges, and lemons, are not natural to any state north of the Carolinas. The two latter species, with certain tropical fruits, are raised in the states of Louisiana and Mississippi, and some ofthe other southern regions. Of the various kinds of forest trees, shrubs, and flowers, such of them as are worthy of notice will be mentioned in the description of the several states and territories. Out of 200 species of animals, which naturalists sup pose is the whole number existing upon earth, 100 species are natives of America. The wild beasts are very nu merous. Among these the mammoth, not found in the civilized parts of America, but supposed still to exist north of the great lakes, stands pre-eminently distin guished for its stupendous magnitude. Of the history of the mammoth we are much in the dark. That animals have once existed carrying these enor mous bones, there can be no question. Their present existence is much doubted ; and the only proof we have to the contrary is a curious tradition of the Indians, handed down to them by their fathers, which being de livered by a principal chief of the Delaware tribe to the governor of Virginia during the American revolution, is recorded in the following words: \u2014 \"That in ancient times a herd of these tremendous animals came to the Big-bone licks, on the the banks of the Ohio, and began a universal destruction of the buffaloes, deer, elks, bears, and other animals which had been created for the ure of the Indians : that the great man above, looking down and seeing this, was so enraged, that he seized his light ning, descended on the earth, seated himself on a neigh bouring mountain, upon a rock, on which his seat and the print of his feet are still to be seen, and hurled his thunder-bolts among them till the whole were slaughtered,"], [62, "46 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. except the big bull, who presented his forehead to the shafts, shook them off as they fell ; but missing one at length, it wounded him in the side ; whereon, springing round, he bounded over the Ohio, over the Wabash, the Illinois, and finally over the great lakes, where he is living at this day.\" Among these wild animals in existence at present, may be enumerated, the buffalo, elk, moose, carrabou, tiger, porcupine, mountain cat, shunk, carcajou, wood chuck, beaver, opposum, racoon, deer, wolf, panther, bear, fox, lynx, hare, rabbit, squirrel, weasel, ermine, marten, otter, seal, rat, mouse, bat, minx, &c. &c. The first thirteen being common to the United States, deserve a more particular description. The Buffalo is larger than an ox ; high on the shoulders and deep through the breast. The flesh of this animal, particularly the female, is equal in goodness to the best beef; its skin makes good leather, and its hair, which approaches to the nature of wool, is manu- factured into a tolerable kind of cloth. In many parts of the Missouri territory, immense herds of buffaloes are found ; and on the River Arkansaw upwards of 3,000 have been seen in one drove. The American Elk is much larger than the animal known by the same name in Europe ; some of them at- taining the amazing height of ten feet. It is shaped somewhat like a deer, and its horns grow to a prodigious size ; some having been seen which were nearly eleven feet from tip to tip. But what is still more extraordinary, these horns are shed yearly, in the month of February,' and by September the new ones are full grown. The grey Moose of America is about the size ofa horse, their horns are as long as those of a stag, but much broader ; and, like the elk, it sheds them annually. The black Moose is from eight to twelve feet high, with horns of a vast size; being no less than two fathoms from the top of one horn to another. Though these animals are of the deer kind, they never herd as deer do in general. Iney delight in cold countries, feeding upon grass"], [63, "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 47 in summer, aud the bark of trees in winter, when the ground is covered with snow. The Carrabou is somewhat like the moose in shape, though not so tall. It is a native of the icy regions of the north, where it is known by tlie name of the Rein deer. The female has horns as well as the male, by which the species is distinguished from all other animals of the deer kind whatsoever. Its flesh is exceedingly good; and its tongue in particular is held in high esteem; The Tiger of America is the most formidable and mis chievous of all the animals of that country. It resembles in shape those of Asia and Africa ; but is considerably smaller; nor does it appear to be so fierce and ravenous as they are ; being unable to contend against a single man. The colour is of a darkish yellow, and is entirely free from spots. TheAmericanPorcypiw. differs very much from that of the old continent; and may be considered as an animal of a different species : the latter being two feet in length, and fifteen inches high, with quills from ten to fourteen inches long ; while the former is only about the size of a small dog, with quills about four inches in length. Its shape resembles that of a fox, except its head, which is something like the head of a rabbit ; and its body is covered with quills, most of which are, excepting at the point, of the thickness of a straw. The Mountain Cat resembles a common cat, but is of a much larger size. Its hair is of a reddish or orange colour, interspersed with spots of black. This animal is exceedingly fierce, though it will seldom attack a man. The Shunk is the most extraordinary animal the Ame rican woods produce. It is of the same species with the pole-cat, which it resembles in shape, but is less in size, and is particularly different in the length of its hair and colour. The hair is above three inches and a half long, and at the end of the tail above four inches. The colour is partly black and partly white, variously disposed over the body, very glossy and beautiful. It lives chiefly in woods and hedges, and is possessed of extraordinary pow ers : which, however, are exerted only when it is pursued."], [64, "48 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. On such an occasion, it ejects from behind a small stream of water, of so subtle a nature, and so powerful a smell, that the air is tainted with it to a surprising distance. The dogs in pursuit immediately abate of their ardour, when they find this offensive battery played off against them ; they instantly turn tail, and leave the animal un- disputed master of the field. Should even but one single drop of this powerful liquid fill upon a man's garment, it is more than probable that he could never wear any part of it more. The fat of the shunk, when externally applied, is a potent emollient. The Carcajou is a creature of the cat kind, and is also found in the north of Europe and in Siberia, where it is called the Glutton. In America it is a terrible enemy to the elk, and to the carrabou, as well as to every species of deer. He either comes upon them unperteived, or climbs up into a tree, and taking his station on some of the branches, drops upon his prey when passing by, sticks his claws between their shoulders, and remains there un- alterably firm. It is in vain that the large terrified ani- mal takes to flight, the carcajou having taken possession of his post, nothing can drive him off, and opening the jugular vein, he soon brings his victim to the ground. The only way of escape is by flying immediately to the water; for, as this voracious creature has a great dislike to that element, he will sooner relinquish his prey than en- ter it. The flesh of the carcajou, as may be supposed, is not fit to be eaten ; but the skin amply rewards the hun- ter for his toil and danger. The fur has the most beau- tiful lustre that can be imagined, and is preferred before all others, with the exception of that of the Siberian fox, or the sable. The Wood Chuck is a ground animal of the fur kind, about fifteen inches long ; its body is round and its legs short ; its fore paws are broad, and constructed for the purpose of digging holes in the ground, in which it bur rows like the mole. Its flesh is tolerably good. The Beaver is an amphibious animal, which cannot live for any long time in the water. The largest beavers"], [65, "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 49 found in America are nearly four feet in length, about fourteen inches in breadth, and weigh fifty or sixty pounds. It is the only creature known that in its fore parts entirely resembles a quadruped, and in its hinder parts seems to approach the nature of fishes, by having a scaly tail. Its teeth are like those ofa rat, but much longer and stronger and admirably adapted for cutting timber and stripping bark, to which purposes they are constantly applied. Its colour is of a light brown, and it has fur of two sorts, the one long and coarse, the other soft, fine, short, and silky; being that which is usually manufactured. Castor, so useful in medicine, is produced from the body of the beaver. The ingenuity of these animals in building their cabins, and in providing themselves subsistence, is truly wonderful. When they are about to choose a habitation, they assemble in companies of two or three hundred, in the months of June and July, and after mature delibera tion, fix on a place where plenty of provisions, and all necessaries, are to be found. Their houses are always situated in the water, where they form a dam by building a bank across the stream, sometimes 100 feet long, and twelve feet broad at the base. This bank is built of wood and clay, for which purpose they select a number of trees, always choosing those above the place where they intend to build, that they may swim down with the cur rent, and placing themselves by threes or fours round each tree, soon bring them to the ground. By the same means they cut the trees into proper lengths, and rolling them into the water, navigate them to the place where they are to be used. Having thus provided timber for the construction of their dam, they next prepare the clay ; but knowing that the conveyance of heavy mate rials would not be so easily accomplished by land as by water, they swim with the mortar upon their broad scaly tails, holding the smaller stakes between their teeth, to the places where they are most wanted. The formation of their cabins is very remarkable ; being built either on piles in the middle of the pond they have formed, on the"], [66, "50 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. bank of a river, or at the extremity of some point of land projecting into a lake. The figure of them is round or oval ; two-thirds of each of them rising above the water ; and this part is large enough to contain eight or ten in- habitants. They are contiguous to each other, so as to allow an easy communication. Each beaver has his place assigned to him, the floor of which he carefully, covers with leaves, rendering it clean and comfortable. Their houses are generally finished in the middle of September, when they begin to lay in their stores. Their provisions for the winter, consist principally of the wood of the birch, the plane, and some few other trees, which they steep in water from time to time, to render it softer. This wood is cut again into small particles, and conveyed toone of their largest lodges, where the whole family meet, to consume their respective dividends, which are made im- partially, in even and equal portions. The Opposum is an animal of a distinct genus, and therefore has little resemblance to any other creature, ex- cept the Kangaroo of New South Wales. It is found in almost every part of America, and is about the size of a common cat, which it resembles in some degree as to its body. Its head resembles the fox, its legs are short, and its feet like those of a rat, as are its ears ; the snout and head are like the hog's ; the teeth, fifty in number, like those of the dog ; and its body covered with whitish hair, long and bristly. But that wliich (before the dis- covery of the kangaroo) distinguished this animal from all others, and has excited the wonder of mankind for more than two centuries, is the extraordinary conforma- tion of its belly ; as it is found to have a false womb, into which the young when brought forth in the usual manner, creep and continue for some days longer, to lodge and suckle securely. This bag afterwards serves them fora retreat, when they want to sleep, or when pursued by an enemy: the dam on such occasions opening this conve niencetoreceivethem. The opposum, when on theground, is a slow helpless animal ; but it climbs trees with great ease"], [67, "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 51 and expedition ; and often hangs from a branch by its tail, which is strong and muscular, for hours together, with the head downwards, watching for its prey. If any lesser animal, which it is able to overcome, passes under neath, it drops upon it with a deadly aim, and quickly devours it. This creature lives upon vegetable as well as animal substances; such as roots, sugar canes, the bark, and even the leaves, of trees. The Racoon is an animal of a genus different from any known on the old continent. Its head is much like a fox's, only its ears are shorter, more round, and more naked. It also resembles that animal in its hair, which is thick, long, and soft ; and in its body and legs, ex cepting that the former is larger, and the latter both larger and shorter. Across its face runs a broad stripe, including its eyes, which are large. Its snout is black, and roundish at the end, like that of a dog, and its teeth, both in number and shape, are similar to those of the dog ; the tail is long and round, with annular stripes on it ; the fore feet are much shorter than the hinder, both armed with five sharp claws, with which, and its teeth, the animal makes a vigorous resistance. Its fore feet serve it instead of hands, like those of the monkey. Upwards of 130 American birds have been enumerated ; which in general greatly exceed those of Europe in the beauty of their plumage, but are much inferior in the melody of their notes. The following only are deserving of particular notice : \u2014 The Water Pelican inhabits the Mississippi, and is of such an amazing size that its pouch contains upwards of eight quarts. This extraordinary bird is a native of Ame rica, and is also found in Africa ; it was once known in Europe, particularly in Russia, but it seems to have de serted our coasts. Of this bird many fabulous accounts have been propagated ; such as its feeding its young with its own blood, and carrying a provision of water for them in its great reservoir to the desert. But the absurdity of the above account refutes itself ; and as for the latter, the pelican uses its bag for very different purposes than that NO. Ill H"], [68, "52 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. of filling it with water. She feeds her offspring with fish macerated for some time in her pouch, and when they cry, flies off for a fresh supply. The Partridge. \u2014 In several parts ofthe United States there are tliree or four different kinds of partridges, all of them larger than the partridges of Europe. \u2014 What is called the quail in New England, is denominated par tridge in the southern states, where the real partridge is not to be found. The Whip-poor-will is remarkable for the plaintive melody of its notes. It acquires its name from the pe culiar noise it makes, which to the people of America sounds whip-poor-will ; to the Indians muck-a-wiss. This is a striking proof how differently the same sounds impress different persons. The Loon is a water fowl of the same species with the Dobchick. It is an exceeding nimble bird, and so expert at diving, that it is with great difficulty killed. The Wakon-bird, which probably is of the same species with the Bird of Paradise, receives its name from the ideas the Indians have of its superior excellence ; the Wakon-bird being, in their language, the bird of the Great Spirit. It is nearly the size of the swallow, of a brown colour, shaded about the neck with a bright green. The wings are of a darker brown than the body, and its tail is composed of four or five feathers, which are tliree times as long as its body, and which are beautifully shaded with green and purple. The Humming-bird is the smallest of all the feathered inhabitants of the air ; but its beautiful plumage surpas ses description. Of this charming little creature there are six or seven varieties, from the size of a small wren, down to that of an large bee. An inhabitant of Europe could never have supposed a bird existing so very small, and yet completely furnished with a bill, feathers, wings, and intestines, exactly resembling those of the largest birds. A bird not so large as one's litttlefinger end, would probably be thought but a creature of imagination, were it not seen in infinite numbers, and. as frequent as butterflies in a summer's day, sporting *in the fields of"], [69, "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 53 America, from flower to flower and extracting their sweets with its diminutive bill. The smallest humming-bird is about the size of a nut ; on its head is a small tuft of jetty black ; its breast is red ; its belly white ; its back, wings, and tail, the finest pale green : small specks of gold are scattered over it with inexpressible grace ; and to crown the whole, an almost imperceptible down softens the several colours, and produces the most pleasing shades, which no silk or velvet can imitate. There are about thirty species of snakes which infest the United States ; of these there are not more than five kinds that are really venomous. The rattle-snake, the copper- headed snake, the thorn-tail snake, the black viper, and the adder, are the most dangerous. The snakes are neither so numerous nor so venomous in the northern as in the southern states. In the latter, however, the inha- bitants are furnished with a much greater variety of plants and herbs, which afford immediate relief to persons bitten by these dangerous creatures. There is an immense variety of insects in the United States, of which the musquito is extremely troublesome, and even dangerous to strangers ; but less so to the inha- bitants of the country. The Alligator is one of the most formidable animals found in America. It is evidently a species of the cro- codile, and in appearance the ugliest creature in existence. They are amphibious, and live in and near to creeks, swamps, and ponds of stagnant water, devouring vast quantities of fish. When tired with fishing, they leave the water to bask themselves in the sun, and then appear like logs of wood ; but on being disturbed in the slight- est manner, they instantly take to the water. Some of them grow to the enormous size of five yards in length. The Guana, the Green Lizard of Carolina, the Blue- tailed Lizard, and the Lion Lizard, are found in the southern states, and are thought to be species of the same genus with the crocodile and alligator. Population, manners, customs, fye. \u2014 The number of inhabitants in the United States, by the last general cen sus, in 1810, has been already given in the statistical"], [70, "54 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. table and noticed in page 17. The present population, 1818, is calculated by every late writer on the subject to exceed nine millions ; nor will this calculation appear at all exaggerated when it is considered, that by natural increase and emigrations from Europe, the population has been more than doubled within twenty-two years ; as will be seen by the following returns made at three distinct periods : \u2014 In the year 1790 the amount of the census was 3,929,326 ; in 1800 it had increased to 5,308,844; andin 1810 the return was 7,239,903; being an augmentation of nearly 2,000,000 in ten years. The next general census will take place in 1820, when, from the prodigious influx of emigrants, during the last two years, and which still continues, the probability is, that the number of inhabitants will be considerably above 10,000,000 The United States, as now existing, constitute a re public, consisting of twenty separate independent states, besides five territorial governments ; having governors, constitutions, and laws of their own, united under a ge neral federal constitution of government, administered by an elective head, and by a proportionate number of representatives of the people from all the states. The spectacle presented by this republic during the last thirty or forty years \u2014 ever since her emancipation began to produce its full effect, and since she fairly entered the lists as an independent nation, with a completely popular government, has been, beyond every thing formerly known in the history of mankind, imposing and instructive. The northern parts of the United States, New En gland in particular, are become the source of an emi gration beyond all comparison more extensive than ever was known in the most confined and over-peopled por tions of the old world. A broad, deep, and rapid stream of population is running constantly into the western country ; and vast states are forming towards the Pacific Ocean, the growth of which as much exceeds in rapidity what we have been accustomed to observe on the shores of the Atlantic, as this leaves at an immeasurable distance the scarcely perceptible progress of European Societies."], [71, "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 55 This powerful migration from east to west is powerfully incited by the vast quantity of fine lands with which the latter region abounds ; and has a strong tendency to bind these two sections together by the indissoluble ties of kindred affection. The manufacturing industry of the north is aided and encouraged by the surplus raw ma terials, and demand for manufactures, in the south ; and both feeling the advantage of the exchange, are bound to each other by the strong bond of mutual interest. Learning is every where encouraged throughout the Union, and ample provision made for the support of schools and colleges. Seminaries ofthe latter description have been long established in all the eastern and middle states, and of late the states of North and South Carolina and Georgia have followed the laudable example. In the new states of the western country, the utmost attention has been paid to literature, and liberal funds with large tracts of land appropiated to the maintenance of schools and academies. Religion, in the United States, is placed on the broad and firm basis of its intrinsic excellence ; and is left to be supported by its own evidence, by the lives of its profes sors, and by the almighty care of its Divine Author. The following denominations of Christianity are more or less numerous, namely, Congregationalists, Presbyterians, Episcopalians, Roman Catholics, Dutch Reformists, Bap tists, Quakers, German Lutherans, German Calvinists, Moravians, Mennonists, Universalists, Shakers, Tunkers, and Methodists. There are a few Jews ; and a great number who reject revealed religion altogether as unne cessary, inconvenient, and fabulous, and plead the suffici ency of natural religion. Of this description are many of the principal inh abitants throughout the Union, and par ticularly to the southward. In the New England states the presbyterians and the independents are the principal sects, but in Connecticut the form of worship and ec clesiastical government of the church of England prevail. More to the south, and especially in Pennsylvania, the quakers are extremely numerous, and highly respectable ; being distinguished, as in every other country, for the ex-"], [72, "56 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. cellence of their morals and universal benevolence ; par- ticularly in promoting peace, discouraging war, aiding the progress of Bible Societies and Sunday Schools, and the abolition of slavery. The moravians are increasing and flourishing greatly ; the methodists likewise spread very wide, and have been of considerable use in society, by the zeal with which they have propagated their opi- nions, and enforced the principles Of morality amongst their votaries. But the camp meetings which are held by this sect and some others, though designed for the best purposes, have often a very contrary tendency ; parti- cularly in the southern states, where they are much fre- quented by the profane and dissolute. One of these meetings exactly resembles, (though upon a much larger scale) the \" holy fair,\" so well described by an admired Scotch poet ; at which \" grace\" is not the only commo- dity to be purchased. There are many Roman catholics throughout the United States, but in Maryland they are by far the most numerous religious sect, and still retain the liberal principles of Lord Baltimore, a Catholic noble- man, by whom that country was first settled in 1663, and who provided for the free exercise of all other religious opinions in the colony. In the United States every one follows pretty much according to his own inclination, his religious opinions, and pursues with undivided eagerness his temporal con- cerns. This apparent apathy perhaps arises partly from the universal equality of all religious denominations. No form of \"worship is prescribed, no religious ordinances are established by law ; whence, every individual is left at liberty to follow his own will ; to neglect or cultivate reli- gion as he sees fit. Almost all the ardour ofthe passing moment is employed m acquiring wealth, and promoting the success of some political party. Hence result a ge- neral calmness and composure in the American commu nity, with regard to the personal feelings and universal dittusion of religion. As there is no national church established, neither is there any lay-patronage, nor system ot tythes The people call and support their minister ; tew churches having sufficient funds to dispense with the"], [73, "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 57 necessity of contribution by the congregation. The law enforces the contract between the pastor and his flock, and requires the people to pay the stipulated salary so long as the clergyman preaches and performs his paro chial duty, according to the agreement between him and his parishioners. In Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Connecticut, the law requires each town to provide, by taxation, for the support of religious wor ship ; but leaves it optional with every individual to choose his own sect. Among the more regular attenders on divine worship all the different sects seem to co-exist in a calm, unruffled atmosphere. It is not very uncommon for the father, mother, and children of the same family, each to follow without opposition, their respective modes of worship. Hence, no leader of any religious persuasion can induce his followers to labour in aggrandizing that sect, as he might, under the same circumstances, induce a similar body in Europe to co-operate with him. The American clergy of all denominations are in ge neral decorous in their exterior deportment, and faithful in the discharge of their pulpit and parochial duties ; and notwithstanding so large a portion of the population is altogether without religious ordinances, yet of late, reli gion has been unquestionably gaining ground. That cold blooded compound of irreligion, irony, selfishness, and sarcasm, formerly so prevalent, is by no means common at present ; which is a strong proof of the existence of a great mass of real piety in the country. Another con vincing proof of the increase of religion, is the rapid spread of Sunday schools, and of missionary and Bible societies. Three years have not elapsed since theif first institution in America, and they have already consi derably diminished the ignorance, poverty, and vice of the larger cities. Many ofthe most respectable families, both ladies and gentlemen, gratuitously engage in the labour of teaching the Sunday scholars, black and white, old and young. Their exertions have caused the sabbath to be respected by the poor, the idle, and the profligate ; and have quickened the growth of piety, order, industry,"], [74, "58 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. and cleanliness, amidst the habitations of filth, indolence, confusion, and iniquity. Nor have the people of the United States, in propor tion to their number and means, fallen short of their Christian brethren in Europe in well-directed efforts to disseminate the sacred Scriptures. In almost every state of the Union, north, east, west, and south, and in many separate districts of some of the states, have Bible soci eties started up, under the direction of zeal and wisdom. The American Bible Society, a national institution, es tablished so recently asin May, 1816, hasalready( August, 1818) above 150 auxiliary branches; besides which there are several independent associations for the distribution of Bibles and Common Prayer-books. The Missionary Societies are established for the purpose of converting the Indians, and also to supply with pious instruction the many thousands of their own people who are. altogether destitute of religious ordinances. The labours of these societies have been singularly beneficial, and are daily and hourly augmenting in usefulness. The morals, manners, and character of every country are founded upon its religious and social institutions, which in the United States are framed in the fulness of individual liberty ; leaving every one to think, speak, and act according to his own inclination and views, pro vided his conduct does not tend to injure his neighbours. Great mistakes may be committed by judging of the American character from what is to be seen in the seaports. The commercial cities of America are like those of other countries, and principle is often sacrificed at the shrine of commerce. To view the character ofthe American peo ple fairly, we must go into the interior, and there the first remark will probably be, that the inhabitants have a high spirit of independence, and will brook no superiority. Every man is conscious of his own political importance and will suffer none to treat him with disrespect : nor is this disposition confined to one rank ; it pervades the whole, and is probably the best security for the liberties of the country. It has been sometimes remarked, that this dis position may encourage rudeness ; but there is no truth"], [75, "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 59 in this observation. As the people will bend to no supe riority, so they really affect none ; and it is certainly a stranger's own fault if he does not enjoy happiness among them. It is very common for many selfish and short-sighted people in Britain to set up their own country as the model of all perfection, and to doubt the existence of equal ad vantages any where else ; and to no country has this doubt been more extended than the United States of Ame rica. It is really surprising to see, that notwithstanding the great intercourse between the two countries, there should be so much ignorance, or rather misinformation, in Great Britain respecting America. Any unprejudiced observer must be obliged to acknowledge, that the Ame rican people possess a polish of manners, and speak a style of language, which must be the result of education, at least equal to what exists in Britain. And this does not' appear to be confined to large towns, but to extend over the whole of the United States. In America, as well as in England, politics are a very popular subject, and the question between the parties is not generally understood. It appears to have arisen about the time when the federal constitution was adopted \u2022. which having occasioned many animated debates, both public and private, those who supported it were called sed eralisls, and those who opposed it anti-federalists : and though it has now received the sanction ofthe whole community, yet the party distinction still subsists under the names of federalists and democrats. Both parties, however, pro- fess republicanism, and are styled federal republicans, and democratic republicans ; but the political difference between them is entirely distinct from that existing be- tween whig and tory in Britain ; where the question is whether the power of government shall be vested in the people or in the crown. \u2014 In America it is whether it shall be confided to this or that set of men. The trading spirit is diffused all over the Union : far mers, mechanics, soldiers, seamen, lawyers, legislators, physicians, nay, sometimes even the clergy, indulge in 1"], [76, "(JO UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. mercantile speculations ; even politics themselves give way to the universal desire of amassing money, ine peculiar circumstances of the republic have conspired to roster the growth of this commercial disposition. During twenty-five years, while war impoverished and wasted Europe, commerce enriched the United States with a ra pidity, and to an extent, unexampled in the history ot nations. Since the peace of 1 8 15, indeed, the diminution of their foreign trade, and the amazing number of insol vencies, ought to teach them to moderate their inordinate desire for wealth, and that extravagance of expenditure far surpassing the rate of living among the corresponding classes in Europe. In the New England States property is more equally divided than in any other civilized country. There are but few overgrown capitalists, and still fewer plunged into the depths of indigence. Those states are alike free from the insolence of wealth on one hand, and the servility of pauperism on the other. They exhibit a more perfect equality in means, morals, manners, and character than has ever elsewhere been found. With the exception of Rhode Island, they all support religion by law ; their numerous parish priests, all chosen by the people them selves, moderately paid, and in general well informed and pious, are continually employed on the sabbaths, and during the week days, in the instruction and amendment of their respective congregations : elementary schools are established in every township, and perhaps not a native of New England is to be found who cannot read, write, and cast accounts. They live universally in villages, or moder ately-sized towns, and carry on their commercial, manu facturing, and agricultural operations by the voluntary labour of freemen, and not by the compelled or half-paid labour of slaves, black or white. In sobriety of manners, in intelligence, spirit, and enterprize, the New England men and those of Scotland are very much alike. Dr. Currie, late of Liverpool, in his elegant biography of the poet Burns, enters at length into the causes which have rendered the great body of the Scottish people so very su- perior to those of any other European country. The"], [77, "61 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. result of his reasoning is, that this national superiority is owing to the combined efforts of the system of parish schools giving to all the means of elementary education, and of a moderately-paid, able, and well-informed clergy, coming into constant contact with, and instructing and regulating, the people : to wliich he adds, as no trifling auxiliary, the absence of those poor-laws which have im- poverished, degraded, and corrupted the whole people of England. In the United States they have also unfortunately adopted the poor -law system ; which, so far as it has yet operated, has proved a canker-worm gnawing at the heart's core ofthe national morals, prosperity, and strength. The American people, however, possess one decided advantage over those of every other country, namely, that of the political sovereignty residing in themselves ; whence they exhibit in their own persons, a moral fearlessness, confi- dence, and elevation, unknown and unimagined else- where. A native free-born American knows no superior on earth; from the cradle to the grave he is taught to be- lieve that all public officers are his servants; and while in all other countries the people are continually flattering and praising their rulers, the very reverse is the case in America, and the rulers are obliged to bow to the supreme power of the people. In the middle states the population is not so national and unmixed as in New England, whose inhabitants are altogether of English origin. They do not support reli- gion by law ; and a considerable portion of their people are destitute of a clergyman, even in the state of New York, and a still greater proportion in some of the other middle states. Elementary schools are not sufficiently numerous, particularly in Pennsylvania, many of whose inhabitants can neither read nor write. Property is not so equally divided, and the distinction of rich and poor is more broadly marked than in New England. Many of their settlements are more recent, and exhibitthe physical, intellectual, and moral disadvantages of new settlements, in the privations, ignorance, and irreligion of the settlers; who were composed of many different nations, having no."], [78, "62 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. one common object in view, either in regard to religious, moral, or social institutions. The English, Dutch, Ger mans, French, Irish, Scotch, Swiss, &c. have not yet had time and opportunity to be all melted down into one com mon national mass of American character. The slaves in this section of the Union, are more numerous than in New England, and in Maryland they are sufficiently so to influence and derogate from the character ofthe people. The moral habits of the middle states, generally, are more lax than those of New England. New York, indeed, partly from proximity of situation, but chiefly from its continual acquisition of emigrants from the eastern states, is rapidly assuming a New England character and aspect. In the southern states, religion receives no support from the law ; and a very large proportion of the inha bitants are destitute of regular preaching and religious instruction. The elementary schools are few, and in ge neral not well administered ; \u2014 many of the white inha bitants cannot even read. Labour in most parts is per formed chiefly by slaves ; and slavery here, as every where else, has corrupted the public morals. The mu latoes are increasing very rapidly ; and, perhaps, in the lapse of years, the black, white, and yellow population will be incorporated into one indiscriminate mass. Du elling and gaming are very prevalent ; and, together with other vices, require the restraining power of religion and morality to check their progress towards national ruin. The western states participate in the morals, manners, and character of those sections of the Union by which they are peopled ; namely, the southern and middle, and above all, the New England states. During the war which separated the American colonies from Britain, and for some years afterwards, the influence of New England predominated in the councils of the infant re public ; while Washington's administration established the prosperity and glory of the country on a solid basis. But since the vast increase of population, and the aston ishing improvement in commerce, manufactures, and agriculture, which have taken place in the southern and"], [79, "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 63 middle states, New England has sunk greatly in politi cal importance ; and now, the rapid growth of the west ern states, in numbers, wealth, and strength, threaten, ere long, to give them a decided preponderance over all the Atlantic sections of the United States ; which will probably terminate in the removal of the seat of general government from Washington to some more central situa tion on the banks of the Mississippi. Nothing has tended so much towards the rapid pro gress of the western country as the strong disposition to emigration among the American people themselves. Even when doing well in the northern, middle, or south ern states, they will break up their establishment, and move westward with an alacrity and vigour, which no other people would do unless compelled by necessity. In the year 18 17, nearly 20,000 waggons, averaging a burden of forty cwt. each, travelled between Baltimore and Phila delphia, on one side, and Pittsburgh on the other side of the Allegany mountains. The freight or carriage ofthe goods thus conveyed, exceeded 2,000,000 of dollars ; to which may be added numberless well loaded stages and mails, travellers in waggons, on horses, and on foot, and some idea may be formed of the incessant line of march over these 300 miles of the western road. It is in this manner that the new states, now under consideration, have advanced in population and prosperity with a rapi dity unparalleled in the history of mankind. The towns in the western country, as is particularly the case with Zanesville, Lancaster, and Chilicothe, in the state of Ohio, are often situated without any regard to the health of the inhabitants, provided they be well located for acquiring wealth ; gain being the chief object of pursuit with all American adventurers. Cincinnati itself stands too low on the banks of the Ohio ; its lower parts being within reach of the spring floods. But it has grown as by enchantment, and promises soon to be come one of the first cities of the west. Within the short space of six years, the greatest part of its present dimensions and wealth has been produced ; and it now exhibits several hundreds of handsome brick houses, sub-"], [80, "64 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. stantial public buildings, and crowded markets, where, within the memory of man, stood only one rude rabin ! Twenty years since, the immense region comprising the states of Ohio and Indiana, numbered only 30,000 souls ; less than are now contained in the small county of Hamilton, in which Cincinnati is situated. Probably the time is not far distant, when the chiof intercourse between the western states and Europe will not be, as at present, through Philadelphia and Baltimore: but be car- ried on through the great rivers which communicate by the Mississippi with the ocean at New Orleans ; in con- sequence of the ascending navigation of these streams being subdued by the power of steam. The activity and enterprize of the Americans in ge- neral, particularly the inhabitants ofthe western country, perhaps exceed those of any other people. Travellers continually are setting out on journeys of two to 3,000 miles, by boats, on horses, or on foot, without any appa- rent anxiety or deliberation. Nearly 1000 persons pass from Cincinnati down the Ohio every summer as traders or boatmen ; and return on foot ; a distance by water of 1700, by land, of 1000 miles. Many go down to New Orleans from Pittsburgh, an additional 500 miles by water, and 300 by land. The store keepers of the wes- tern towns resort to Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New York, once a year, to lay in their goods ; but in a short time, as has been already noticed, probably these jour- neyings eastward will be exchanged for visits down the Ohio and Mississippi to New Orleans. The vast and growing produce of the western states, in grain, flour, cotton, sugar, tobacco, peltry, lumber, &c which always find a ready market at New Orleans, will, by rfieans of steam-boat navigation, be returned through the same channel in the manufactures and luxuries of Europe and Asia, to supply the constantly-increasing demands of the west, and render New Orleans one of the greatest com- mercial cities in the universe. After this brief sketch of the morals, habits and man ners, of the four great sections of the United States, the"], [81, "65 UN-TED STATES OF AMERICA. following remarks, from the same respectable source may not be unacceptable to the curious reader. The high wages of labour, the abundance of every kind of manual and mechanical employment, the plenty of provisions, the vast quantity and low price of land, all contribute to produce a healthy, strong, and vigorous population. Four-fifths of the American people are en- gaged in agricultural pursuits, and a great majority of these are proprietors of the soil wliich they cultivate. In the intervals of toil, their amusements consist chiefly of hunting and shooting, in the woods, or on the mountains; whence they acquire prodigous muscular activity and strength. There are no game laws, to prohibit the possession and use of fire-arms to the great body ofthe people ; and the boys carry a gun almost as soon as they are able to walk. This, with the habitual practice of shooting at a target with the rifle, renders the Americans the most unerring marksmen, and the most deadly musketry, in the world. So expert are they with this murderous weapon, that some men of the Virginia rifle regiment, when quartered in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, a few years since, had such a dependence on each others dexterity, that one would hold a piece of board, nine inches square, between his knees, whilst another shot at it with a ball at the distance of 100 paces. This they used to do for the amusement ofthe town's people, as often as they were called upon. Thus the people of the United States possess, in an eminent degree, the physical elements of national great- ness and strength. Add to these the general prevalence of early instruction, which enables the great mass of the people to develope their natural faculties and powers, and capacitates them for undertaking any employment, requiring shrewdness, intelligence, and skill ; whence their singular ingenuity in mechanical and manual opera- tions, and their sound understanding, enterpnze, and perseverance in the practical concerns of life. And, to crown all, the political sovereignty of the nation residing in the people, gives them a personal confidence, self-pos session, and elevation of character, unattainable by any"], [82, "66 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. other people not similarly situated ; and which renders them quick to perceive, and prompt to resent and punish any insult offered to individual or national honour. Whence in the occupations of peace, and the achievements of war, the Americans average as great an aggregate of effective force, physical, intellectual, and moral, as has ever been exhibited by the same number of any other people, ancient or modern. Individuals in other countries may and do exhibit as much bodily activity and strength, as much energy of mind and vigour of understanding, as much moral force and elevation, as can be shewn by any American individuals ; but no country can display such a population, en masse, as are now quickening the United States with their prolific energy, and ripening fast into a substance of power, every movement of which will soon be felt in its vibrations to the remotest corners of the earth. Sagacity and shrewdness are the peculiar characteristics of American intellect, and were never more pre-eminent than in the advice of the secretary of the navy, during Washington's administration, viz. that the United States should build their ships nominally of the same rate with those of Europe, but really of greater strength \u2014 of more speed, tonnage, and guns, than the corresponding classes of European vessels, that they might ensure victory over an enemy of equal, or nearly equal, force. There are, however, many draw-backs upon the high elements of national greatness here enumerated ; and as it is not intended that this werk should represent the fair side only of the American character, without also exhi- biting its darker shades, it is here proper to notice the baleful influence of negro slavery upon the people of that country. It has greatly demoralized the inhabitants of the southern, and those of the western states, which have adopted this execrable system. A distinguished writer has most justly observed, that \" if there be an ob ject truly ridiculous in nature, it is an American patriot, signing resolutions of independency with one hand, and with the other brandishing a whip over his affrighted slave.\""], [83, "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 67 Much has been written to shew the injustice and iniquity of enslaving the Africans ; so as to render it unnecessary here to add any thing further on that part of the subject. But the following observations respecting the influence of slavery upon policy and morals, will not be deemed unin teresting : \u2014 From repeated and accurate calculations it has been found, that the expence of maintaining a slave, especially if the purchase money be included, is much greater than that of maintaining a free man ; and the labour of the tree man, influenced by the powerful motive of gain, is at ieast twice as profitable to the employer as that of the slave. Besides, slavery is the bane of in dustry ; rendering labour, among the whites, not only unfashioaable, but disgraceful. Industry is the offspring of necessity rather than of choice. Slavery precludes this necessity ; and indolence, which strikes at the root of all social and political happiness, is the unhaopy con sequence. \u2014 These observations, without adding any thing upon the injustice of the practice, shew that slavery is highly impolitic. Its influence on manners and morals is equally pernicious. The di-iringuished author of the \"Notes on Virginia,\" says, \" There murt doubtless be an unhappy influence on the manners of our people by the existence of slavery among us. The whole intercourse between master and slave, is a perpetual exercise of the most boisterous pas sions, the most unremitting despotism on the one part, and degrading submissions on the other. Our children see this and learn to imitate it ; for man is an imitative animal. This quality is the germ of all education in him : from his cradle to his grave, he is learning to do what he sees others do. These remarks do honour to the head and heart of their author, (Mr. Jefferson) and it is probable, from the great reputation which he holds among his countrymen, that it may have produced a considerable effect in lessen ing the evils of slavery. Much, however, remains to be done : \u2014 Full one million seven hundred thousand negroes are still held as slaves in the United States ; for, though slavery has been abolished by a law of the ge- K"], [84, "68 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. neral government in 1803, and also by most of the eas tern and middle states,* yet that \" broadest foulest blot\" upon a nation professing Christianity, is still partially to lerated, and prevails over a very large portion of the Union ; corrupting and debasing the public morals, and communicating its depraving influence to both the slave and his master. Besides the negroes, there are upwards of 200,000 free people of colour ; both these classes, however, acquire occasionally an admixture of the blood of the white population, and the mestizos are gaining fast in number upon the blacks : \u2014 The great body of slaves are to be found in the southern states. The experience of all history proves that the structure of society in slave-holding countries in unfavourable to internal peace at all times, and still more so to security and strength in the season of foreign warfare. Besides, a slave is ignorant of the very elements of industry, which is the basis of all social prosperity. While in bondage he only obeys the impulse of another's will, he is actuated by no other motive but the dread of the lash ; whereas, when made free, he must think, plan, provide for him self and family, and perform all the duties of a citizen. It is necessary to make a slave a man, before he is made a free man. The slave, recently liberated, has experi enced only the most laborious and disagreeable of the occupations of a citizen ; and not having learned any forecast, is unwilling to toil when free. The emancipated negroes of Massachusetts prove, that such an order of beings have not the capacity to avail themselves of the benefits of civil liberty. For in that state, where slavery * Though the law of congress prohibiting the importation of slaves, into any part of the Union, was passed in 1 803, it did not begin to operate until 1808. In the northern and middle states the slaves are few : Massachusetts has, by statute, abolished slavery altogether within her jurisdiction ; New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania, have passed acts for its gradual abolition within their territories ; Ohio has prohibited, by her constitution, its existence on her soil: Indiana has likewise banished it; or rather, it was never admitted within her borders : Mary land, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Louisiana, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Mississippi, keep up a large body of slaves within their respective sovereignties, amounting to about one-third of their whole population, and making nearly one-sixth of the population of all the United States ! namely, Maryland, 150,000; Virginia, 460,000; North Carolina, 254,000; South Carolina, 246,000; Georgia, 173,000; Kentucky, 238.000; Tennessee, 102,000; Louisiana 57,000; Mississippi, 31,000;\u2014 making a total of 1,711,000!"], [85, "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 69 is abolished by law, and which consequently opens an asy- lum to fugitive slaves from the neighbouring states, the negroes do not keep up their stock of population, by the help both of native breeding and runaway importation ; so improvident, so helpless, so deficient in all those habits of steady and useful industry, which are essentially ne- cessary to obtain a competent support for themselves and a growing family, have they been rendered by a long- continuance in slavery. We are not, therefore, to expect that a body of eman- cipated slaves, whether freed by releasement or rebellion, can be converted into a community of free citizens, living under a free government and equitable laws. And it is greatly to be feared, that the negroes in the southern states of the Union, who labour under the double curse of slavery and want of civilization, ean only be kept in subjection by their white masters so long as they are kept in chains. Thus the modern system of negro slavery, as it prevails in the European colonies, and in the United States, is one entire circle of flagrant evil. It not only creates an enormous mass of physical suffering and moral guilt, while the negroes continue in the fetters of per- sonal bondage ; but also by brutalizing their bodies, by darkening their understanding, and by corrupting their hearts, it incapacitates them from receiving and enjoying the privileges and blessings of civil and religious liberty ; whence this iniquitous system, as it now flourishes among nations calling themselves Christian, provides by the very atrocity and vast aggregate amount of its own guilt for its own frightful perpetuity. But let it always be remembered, that tho introduction of slavery into North America was a part of the policy of the colonial system ; and had it not taken place be fore the revolution, it is now evident that it never would have taken place. But unfortunately it exists \u2014 it is in- corporated with the whole plan of civil society \u2014 its in- fluence has extended through every branch of domestic economy, and to extirpate the evil must be a work of time. African schools and churches have risen up, and black teachers and preachers have shewn themselves as compe-"], [86, "70 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. tent to perform their important functions as their white brethren. Doubtless the only possible means of ren dering these negroes honest, industrious, and provident, are to be found in the extensive diffusion of religious and moral instruction among them. \u2014 A few ages of civil li berty and general education would silence for ever those contemptible cavilers, who assert, that the negroes are a race of animals inferior to man, and prove to the world that God made of one blood all the nations of the earth. But slavery, though the greatest, is not the only evil in the United States. \u2014 Lotteries pervade the middle* southern, and western states of the Union, and spread a horribly increasing mass of idleness, fraud, theft, false hood and profligacy throughout all classes ofthe labouring population. And what renders these prolific sources of wickedness still more formidable, is the sanction they re ceive fiom the different state legislatures ; which scarcely ever assemble without adding to the number of lotteries. The prevailing vice, however, in every part of the re public, New England excepted, is immoderate drinking; encouraged, no doubt, by the relaxing heat ofthe climate in the southern, middle, and western states, by the high wages of labour, and by the absence of all restriction in the shape of excise duty. Not only the labourers, but many of the farmers, merchants, and other classes of the community, are prone to a pernicious indulgence in spi rituous liquors. The poor-law system, fraught with egregious folly and positive evil, and which, like the game-laws, powerfully tends to produce immorality and vice ; has been intro duced into the United States : \u2014 Their usual effects will soon be exhibited in a deplorable increase of idleness and profligacy, and the humiliating spectacle of a degraded populace. With the exception oi forgery, in the inge nuity and audacity of which, the Americans themselves far surpass all other people, the foreigners and free blacks are the most numerous and atrocious of the criminals in America. From the vast shoals of labouring emigrants which daily arrive from all parts of Europe, are filled up the lowest departments in the manufactories, or the ma-"], [87, "UNITED ST__.ES OF AMERICA. 71 nual operations of the large cities. Many of these per sons, particularly the natives of Ireland, from the state of galling oppression and degradation in which they have been held, are rude, intemperate, and abandoned ; and often tenant the bridewells and state-prisons. Next in the scale of criminality are the freed negroes, and lastly the American citizens ; or which, few find their way into confinement for crime, excepting, as before stated, for forgery : of adepts in which, the United States produce a greater number, in proportion to their population, than any country in Europe. General aspect of society. \u2014 Although the origin of all the American people is not the same, yet the primary causes of their migration thither were similar ; and the liberal freedom of their social institutions, their general intelligence, and common interests, have assimilated their habits and manners so much, that notwithstanding a com paratively small population is spread over an immense ter ritory, there are fewer provincial diversities of character and behaviour in the United States than in any other country. Nine-tenths of the people speak the same lan guage, without any variety of dialect ; which is in itself, a bond of national unity, not to be found in any part of Europe. The laws, government, policy, interests, reli gion, md opinions of the inhabitants of all the different states essentially correspond and coincide. They are all bound together by the same mighty bands of political and commercial liberty. Their civil institutions, and re ligious toleration, tend to produce habits of intelligence and independence ; they have no division into the higher, middle, and lower orders, much less into six or seven classes, as in some European countries ; they have no grandees \u2014 no populace \u2014 they are all people. Natural equality is unattainable in America, as in every other country ; because some men will be taller, or stronger, or richer, or wiser than others, in spite of every effort of human legislation. But political equality is pos sessed by the people of the United States, in a degree far superior to what has been known in any other country, ancient or modern. All their civil and religious insti-"], [88, "72 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. tutions are framed in the spirit of social equality. By the high wages paid for labour, and the abundance of subsistence, the general diffusion of elementary education, and the right of universal suffrage, every man, not black, is a citizen, sensible of his own personal importance. Not more than one million of the people reside in the large cities and towns ; the other nine millions* live on farms or in villages : most of them are lords of the soil they cultivate, and some are wealthy. This subdivision of property, and the equal division of land and money among all the children, gives an individual independence, and an equality of manner to the American population, altogether unknown in Europe. The personal independence which every one in the United States may enjoy, in any calling, by ordinaryin dustry and common prudence, is in itself one of the greatest of political blessings. So long as a man obeys that injunction of scripture, to \" owe no one any thing,\" (and in that country debt must arise from idleness, or vice, or folly) he is as free as the air he breathes ; he knows no superior, not even the president, whom his vote has either helped or hindered in the career of exaltation. Generally speaking, those are the most attached to a country who own a part of its soil, and have therefore a stake in its welfare : now a great majority of the Ame rican people have this stake. In other countries low wages and unremitted labour stupify the understanding, break the spirit, and vitiate the virtue of the great body of the population. In the United States the price of labour is high, and constant toil merely optional ; but the ocean and the land offer continual incitements to industry, by opening inexhaustible regions of enterprize and wealth. In consequence, all is motion ; every one follows some vocation, and the whole country is in perpetual progress. Each industrious individual feels himself rising in the scale of opulence and importance ; and with patriotic * Since the Statistical Table has been printed off, a very recent publication has been received from America, by which it appears, that at the end of the year 1817 the number of inhabitants in the United States amounted to 10,405,547 ; a num ber exceeding what was anticipated would be the amount of the population inl820"], [89, "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 73 pride sees his beloved country growing with the growth of her aspiring children. Marriages in the United States are earlier than in Europe ; there being no constraint by statute, and no fear of not being able to maintain a family in so young a coun try, whose extensive territory offers an abundant provi sion to every species of industry, when regulated by dis cretion. Each marriage throughout the Union, on an average, produces six births, of which Jour are reared. Any clergyman of any sect, or any justice of thc peace, may marry a couple without asking questions. Matrimo nial contracts not only take place at an early age, but in general from disinterested motives. Indeed, owing to their social institutions and habits, individual fortunes are seldom sufficiently large, compared with the over-grown family opulence of Europe, to induce mere money matches where the property, not the parties, are united. There is no fear in America of the proverb, so commonly levell ed in Britain against pure affection, that \" love in a cot tage generally ends in a cottage without love ;\" because any man in any occupation, if he be industrious, honest, and careful, may make ample provision for his wife and children. The sanctity of the marriage bed is very sel dom profaned ; nor is seduction frequent. The familiar but innocent intercourse of the sexes, renders American society peculiarly interesting and delightful. It is not confined, either before or after marriage, as in some parts of Europe, to a narrow circle of exclusive aristrocracy, where the portion, and not the person, is the object of affection : in the United States it is unrestrained, chaste, and honourable. There the well-educated and virtuous women are kindly and affectionately treated by their hus bands, loved and reverenced by their children, and re spected by society \u2014 of which they compose the brightest ornament and honour. The amusements of the Americans do not exhibit so ferocious an aspect as those of some other countries : they being more addicted to music and dancing, than to bull-baiting, cock-fighting, and boxing. Theatrical ex hibitions, balls, routs, the sports of the field and turf, and"], [90, "7_< UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. the pleasures of the table, are the chief amusements in the United States, and conducted much in the same way as in Europe; from which quarter they generally import their players, dancing masters, singers, and musicians ; 6uch commodities, as yet. making no part of the sljple of the republic. \u2014 There is no such relation as master and servant in any part ofthe Union ; indeed the name is not permitted : \u2014 \" help \" is the designation of one who receives wages tor service. This help is generally afforded by free blacks and emigrants from Europe ; the natives seldom lowering their dignity so much as enter ing a house in the capacity of servants. The national vanity of the United States is fully equal to that of any other country \u2014 not even excepting France. It blazes out every where, and on all occasions, in their conversation, newspapers, pamphlets, speeches, and books. They assume it as a self-evident fact, that the Americans surpass ail other nations in virtue, wisdom, valour, liberty, government, and every other excellence. All Europeans they profess to despise, as ignorant pau pers and dastardly slaves. \u2014 The causes of this vanity are obvious ; the popular institutions of the republic, vesting the national sovereignty in tbe people, have a direct ten dency to make that people self-important and vain ; and this would be the case in any other country under simi lar circumstances. Add to which, the incessant flattery they receive in newspapers, and public talks, about their collective majesty, wisdom, power, dignity, &c. their un exampled prosperity inrthe occupations of peace ; and, lastly, their actual achievements in war. Twice have they grappled, in deadly encounter, with the most pow erful, the bravest, and the most intelligent nation in Eu rope ; and twice have they triumphed over the most skilful commanders, and best appointed troops of that nation, in the battle-field and on the ocean. The result of all this is, that the American people pos sess physical, intellectual, and moral materials of national greatness, superior to those of any other country ; and in order to render the United States the greatest nation in tbe"], [91, "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 75 world, they have only gradually to augment the power of their general government ; to lighten the cords, and strengthen the stakes, of their federal union ; to organ ize a judicious system of internal finance ; to provide for the more general diffusion of rational knowledge ; to en large and elevate their system of liberal education ; and to increase the dimensions, and exalt the standard, of their literature, art, and science. Currency, Commerce, \u00a7c. \u2014 Tho currency of the United States is extremely simple. The dollar is esti mated as the money unit, proceeding downwards, by the decimal ratio of tens, to dimes, cents, and mills ; and up wards to eagles of ten dollars value, which is the largest gold coin. The value of the dollar in British money, is 4. . 6d. but in consequence ofthe vast issue of bills of credit previous to the revolutionary war, a difference was intro duced between the English sterling money, and the cur rencies of the different colonies, which remains to this day : \u2014 The price of a dollar, in New England currency, is 6s. ; in New \"York, 8_. ; in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Maryland, 7*. 6_\\ ; in Virginia, 6s. ; in North Ca rolina, 8.. ; and in South Carolina and Georgia, 4>_. 8__ In 1792, congress passed a law to establish a mint, and the following coins were struck : Of gold ; eagles, half eagles, and quarter eagles.

The foreign trade of the United States, as in Great Britain has greatly diminished in consequence of the peace concluded in 1815 ; though the commerce of the rest of the world has considerably increased. Britain has lost her war monopoly, and America has ceased to be the general carrier for mankind. They are both reduced to the level of peace competition, and must now contend in foreign markets with the skill and ingenuity of France and Italy, the patient industry and perseverance of the United Netherlands, the rival labours of Denmark, Swe- den, Russia, and the commercial parts of Germany ; to which may be added the efforts of Spain and Portugal. Hence have arisen, during the last three years, both in the United States and in the British Isles, very general and very grievous distress, bankruptcy, and ruin, among their merchants, manufacturers, and farmers. In Britain the pressure has been more severe, on account of the enormous public expenditure, the confined territory, and crowded population of her home dominions, which allow no outlet for her people. In the United States the evil has been much less felt than in Britain ; although the bank- ruptcies among her merchants and manufacturers have been numerous and distressing ; and the farmers also have suffered greatly for want of a market for their pro- duce. But the comparative scanty population, and the immense outlet for enterprising industry, in the new lands and virgin soil of the western country, prevent the necessity of any one possessing health and industry, suf- fering from want of food, clothing, and lodging. The foreign commerce of the republic is, indeed, at present, much less than it was previous to December, 1807, the month in which the embargo on all trade with other countries was laid on by congress ; but such isjthe activity, skill, and enterprise of the American people, so well built, well navigated, and expeditious are their ships, and so abundant the soil, in valuable staple articles, that she must always average her full share of external com- merce ; and her home trade is continually increasing, by the improvement of her internal navigation, the variety"], [94, "78 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. of her products, and the rapid growth of her population, wealth, and intercourse. The average wages for all sorts of labour is double to what it is in England, and nearly four times greater than in France ; and land is plentiful, cheap, and fertile ; so that those who are straitened and embarassed in the large cities, have only to fall back into the country, and become industrious yeomen, and they will readily provide ample sustenance for themselves, and lay a broad and permanent foundation of independence for their families.

In one year ten millions of pounds have been made in the territory of New Orleans, now state of Louisiana ; and about the same quantity made from the maple-tree throughout the United States. Sugar-cane plantations are increasing in Louisiana, and twenty millions of pounds weight of sugar are supposed to have been made in 1817- In the state of Georgia, also, the sugar-cane is cultivated with success. The culture of the cane is not more labo- rious than that of cotton, and less liable to accidents : a moderate crop is 1000 pounds per acre ; and in a few years a sufficient quantity will probably be made within the limits of the United States, to supply their consump- tion. The increase of American tonnage is unexampled in the history of the commercial world, owing to the in- creased quantity of bulky domestic produce exported, the increase of population, and extent of the carrying trade. The increase of the registered tonnage, or ton- nage employed in foreign trade, from 1793 to 1801, was 358,815 tons, having nearly doubled in eight years.

From the preceding view of the American commerce, it must be self-evident that the congress made great sacri fices when it came to the important resolution, in 1807, of shutting the ports of the United States against Great Britain, France, and the other belligerent powers, in order that it might not be drawn into the war. The wisdom and sound policy of that measure have since been very conspicuous. Several laws of a commercial nature, affecting the trade between Great Britain and America, have been enacted during the last session of congress ; some of which, par ticularly the act relating to navigation, passed in April, 1818, were very unexpected, and for a time caused con siderable alarm. In consequence of repeated applications from the British merchants, the American government consented to suspend the operations of these laws for a certain period ; namely, the regulations relative to im portations from the West Indies, to commence the lst of September; from Europe, lst December, 1818; and from all other places, the lst of August, 1819- One of these new acts requires, that after the 20th of October, 1818, all goods subject to ad valorem* duties, imported into the United States (belonging to persons re siding out of those States) must be accompanied by the affidavit of the owner, that the invoice is the true value of such goods ; and is further to declare, whether he or they are the manufacturers, or are concerned in the pro fits of any trade or art by which they have been manu factured ; and if so, he or they shall further testify, that the prices charged, are the current value ofthe same at the place of manufacture. The ad valorem duties on goods are to be charged asheretofore, except that the charo-e is to be made in the invoice, including all charges, except commission, outside packages, and insurance. A part of the goods in every invoice is to be examined and appraised, and the duty to be paid on the appraisement, unless it should be less than the invoice, when it is to be calculated I A correct list of the duties charged in the United States on the importation of merchandise of every description, will be found in the Appendix to this work."], [101, "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 85 on that ; or, if the goods are charged so much below the appraisement as to leave no room to doubt an intention to defraud the revenue, a heavy penalty is incurred. In case articles are discovtred, not enumerated in the invoice, the whole package will be forfeited : this act to continue in force for two years. An act has likewise been passed, directing, that from the 30th of September, 1818, goods owned wholly or in part by British subjects, coming directly or indirectly from, or having touched at, any British port closed against American vessels, shall be admitted to entry in the United States ; and likewise directs, that from the same period, British vessels clearing from thence, with articles on board, the produce ofthe United States, (other than sea-stores) the consignee must first give bonds that the goods shall not be landed in any port closed against American vessels. A law has also been passed to change the duty on the following articles : \u2014 Manufactures of copper, silver, plated saddlery, coach and harness furniture, to twenty-five per cent. ; cut glass at thirty per cent. ; tacks, brads, and sprigs, not exceeding sixteen ounces to 1000, the same as on nails ; brown Russia sheeting, not exceeding fifty-two archeens per piece, 160 cents each piece ; white do. do. 250 cents ; and a law to increase the duty on the following articles : \u2014 iron in pigs, to fifty cents per cwt ; iron castings, seventy-five cents per cwt ; nails four cents per lb. ; spikes three cents ; iron in bolts and bars, manufactured without rolling, seventy-five cents percwt. ; anchors two cents per lb. ; alum two dollars per cwt. The two last laws took place the 30th June, 1818. Another act continues the existing duties on certain wool len and cotton goods to the 30th of June, 1826, which by their limitation, would otherwise expire in 1819. An act requiring that all wines and spirits, imported after the lst June, 1818, must be deposited in the public ware house, to entitle them to debenture ; and an act directing the refunding of all discriminating duties upon tonnage or merchandise imported, in respect to British vessels which have entered into ports of the United States, between the 3d of July and 18th of August, 1815 ; provided a"], [102, "86 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. similar provision be made by the British government ra favour of American vessels entered into British ports during the same period. Manufactures. \u2014 In the United States, manufactures may be considered as yet little more than in their infancy; but they are fast approaching to maturity. The country abounds with raw materials for almost every purpose useful to mankind. Iron is found in various parts ofthe continent, in great abundance, and of every quality ; and manufactures of that metal are carried on to a very consi derableextent. Forthis purpose, water-mills are chieflyem ployed ; and in finishing most of the articles, great num bers of boys are engaged, whose early habits of industry are of importance to the community, to the present sup port of their families, and to their own future comfort. Coppersmiths and brass-founders, particularly the for mer, are numerous in the United States. The material is a natural production ofthe country. In many parts of the states, mines of copper have been actually wrought, and several more lately discovered. Lead also abounds in great plenty, and requires little to unfold it to an amazing extent. Prolific mines of that metal have long been open in Virginia, Pennsylvania, and other parts of the thirteen original states; and in the Missouri territory it is found in such prodigious quantities, that, with a suffi ciency of skilful miners, under proper management, enough could be raised to supply the whole world. As an important instrument of manufacture, fossil coal may, without impropriety, be mentioned among the sub jects ofthe present remarks. There are many coal mines now worked in the old states, particularly in Virginia. The town of Pittsburgh is supplied with coal from the ad jacent hills, many of which are wholly composed of that substance ; and throughout the western states and territo ries, proofs of its existence have been discovered in a great variety of places. Their is scarcely any manufacture of greater import ance to the United States than that of skins. The direct and very happy influence it has upon agriculture, by promoting the rearing of cattle, is a very material"], [103, "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 87 consideration. Numerous tanneries are now carried on as a regular business in many of the states, some on a very extensive scale ; and in several places they constitute a valuable item of incidental family manufacture. The cotton branch, in particular, seems to have over come the first obstacles to success ; producing corduroys, velverets, fustians, jeans, and other similar articles, of a quality that will bear a comparison with the like goods from Manchester. Many establishments for the printing and staining of cotton have lately commenced, which bid fair to rise into the first importance. A promising essay towards the fabrication of cloths, kerseymeres, and other woollen goods, is in a prosperous condition at Hertford, in Connecticut ; and similar attempts have been success fully made at many places both in the old and new states. Specimens of the different kinds that have been seen, evince that these fabrics have attained a considerable de gree of perfection. Household manufactures of woollen articles are carried on in different parts of the United States, to a very in- teresting extent ; and many thousands of families spin and make up their own clothing. Hats of wool, and of wool mixed with fur, are made in large quantities, and constitute avery productive manufacture, rapidly extend- ing over the whole North American continent. The production of silk is attended with much facility in most parts of the Union ; but flourishes most in Connecticut, where silk stockings, handkerchiefs, ribbons, buttons, &c. are now made to a great amount. A manufactory of lace has also been established at Ipswich, in the state of Mas- sachusetts. Different manufactures of glass are carried on, not only in the eastern and middle states, but also in the western country, particularly at Pittsburgh, where exten- sive glass-works are established. The sands and stones called tar go, which include flinty and crystalline substan- ces, and the salts of various plants, particularly kali or kelp, constitute the essential ingredients, and are every where to be found in North America. An extraordinary abundance of fuel always at hand, gives great advan tages to such undertakings."], [104, "88 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

It is made from the sap or juice of the acer, or maple-tree, which grows spontaneously in North America, and may be found in every part of the country from 36 deg. to 42 deg. N. lat. and upon the Mississippi as far north as lat 45 deg. in such abundance, as would be equal to furnish sugar for the inhabitants of the whole earth. \u2014 The process of making maple sugar will be described in the Appendix to this work. The manufacture of wines is also growing fast into respectability in the United States. Successful experi ments have been made by some French settlers on the Ohio, which evince the practicability of producing home made wines of excellent quality ; and as grapes are the spontaneous production of the country, particularly that west of the Allegany mountains, and, by culture, might be raised in any quantity, this manufacture bids fair to"], [105, "UNITED STATES Or AMERICA. 89 diminish, and in time, perhaps, wholly to preclude, foreign importation. Much is expected from the exertions of a French colony lately settled in the Alabama territory, whose principal object is the culture of the vine. The introduction of manufactures into, and their ex tended increase over, a country, generally promise large profits to speculators and men of large capital. It is therefore not to be expected that the mere circumstance of manufactures being destructive to the virtue, health, and happiness of the labourers employed in them, will ever be of sufficient weight to deter any nation from in troducing these nurseries of individual wealth, and wide spread poverty among themselves, whenever an oppor tunity shall occur. The wages of labour in the United States are much higher than those of England and France as already noticed, page 78 ; and yet the agricultural products of the country find a profitable market in Eu rope; while the expence of erecting and continuing ma nufacturing establishments is such as, in many instances, to disable them from contending with those of Europe, unless protected by prohibitory duties, bounties, and a monopoly. The cause of these contradictory effects is to be found in the vast quantity and low price of the new and fertile lands in America. During the late war with England, manufactures thrived in the United States, precisely because they had a monopoly of the home market, and compelled the con sumer to pay above one hundred per cent, more for goods of an inferior quality to those which might have been im ported from Europe at half the price. At that period there was a capital of about Dois. 1,000,000,000 em ployed in carrying on American manufactures ; but on the return of peace, the influx of European goods redu ced the price to least one-half, and stopped perhaps more than half, of the manufacturing establishments in the Union ; so that the capital now employed in manufac tures scarcely reaches the sum of 500,000,000 of dollars. It has been already stated, that one of the most promi nent causes which has hitherto impeded the progress of manufacturing, has been the abundance of land, com pared with the population, the high price of labour, and"], [106, "90 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. the want of capital. As wages are so high, and land so cheap, in the United States, there is a continual bounty offered to labourers to leave the manufacturers' service, and to buy land, and to cultivate it for themselves; since every man, who has any proper feeling fur independence at his heart, would rather toil for sums. If and family, as an uncontrolled yeoman, than labour as a confined ser- vant to a stranger. Among the other causes which have injured the American manufactures may be mentioned, the great extension of her commerce during the late Eu- ropean wars, and the continuance of habits, after the causes which produced them have ceased to exist. Se- veral of these obstacles have, however, been removed or lessened. The cheapness of provisions had always, to a certain extent, counterbalanced the high price of manual labour;' and this is now, in many important branches, nearly superseded by the introduction of machinery. Few nations can boast of skill and ingenuity in manu- factures, and especially improvements in labour-saving en- ginery, equal to those which have been exhibited and dis- covered in the progress of the mechanical arts in the United States. The causes of this superior ingenuity and skill are various ; the great wages given for labour, and the comparative scarcity of labourers, present a constant bounty of certain and immediate remuneration to all those who shall succeed in the construction of any machinery that may be substituted in the place of human labour. Add to to this, the entire freedom of vocation enjoyed by every individual in that country. There, they have no compulsory apprenticeships ; no town and corporation restraints, tying each man down to his own peculiar trade and calling, as in Europe. In the United States every man follows whatever pursuit, and in whatever place, his inclination, or opportunity, or interest, prompts or per- mits ; and consequently a much greater amounfof active talent and enterprize is employed in individual under- takings there, than in any other country.- Many men in the United States following various callings either toge ther or in succession.

There is also a constant migration thither of needy and desperate talent from Europe, which helps to swell the amount of American ingenuity andinvention; and the European discoveries in art and science generally reach the United States a few months after they first see the light in their own country, and soon become united with those made by the Americans themselves. What the present annual value of manufactures in the republic is, has not yet been ascertained ; hut, before the peace of 1815 had reduced their monopoly price, and diminished the number of manufacturing establishments, their yearly value was estimated thus : Manufactures of Wood Dots. 25,000,000 Leather 24,000,000 Soap and tallow candles 10,000,000 Spermaceti candles and oil ... . 500,000 Refined sugar 1,600,000 Cards . 300,000 1,600,000 Hats 13,000,000 Spirituous and malt liquors .... 14,000,000 Iron 18,000,000 Cotton, wool, and flax 45,000,000 Making a total of Dots. 151,400,000 Of this amount nearly the whole is consumed at home, of exports : from the following table exports : as appears N Exports of Manufacture.

The manufactures from foreign materials are, spirits from molasses, refined sugar, chocolate, gunpowder, brass, and copper, and medicines. The manufacture of woo/is extending rapidly in the United States. The Merino breed thrives well in America, and their number is aug menting fast throughout the Union. The whole number of sheep already reaches nearly 20,000,000, and is con tinually increasing. The British Isles maintain about 30,000,000 of sheep ; only one-third more than the American sheep, of all kinds, taken together ; and the United States can easily support twenty times their pre sent number. By evidence before the house of commons in 1808, it appeared that in the year 1807, and previous to that period, America purchased one half of all the woollen goods manufactured in Yorkshire, from the coarsest to the finest article ; at present she does not import the one-tenth part of the woollens made in that county. In the articles of iron and hemp, and more especially the latter, the United States probably will soon be inde pendent of Russia and the rest of the world. The cul ture of hemp succeeds well in many parts ofthe Union, particularly in Kentucky, which in one year produced upwards of 120,000 cwt. valued at 700,000 dollars, and made also, in the sameyear, 40, 000 cwt. of cordage, valued at 400,000 dollars, making 1,100,000 dollars for these two articles. The manufacture of cotton increases rapidly, and, as well as wool and flax, is manufactured in establishments and in families. The first American cotton mill was erected in the state of Rhode Island, in the year 1791, another in the same state in 1795, and two more in the state of Massachusetts, in the years 1803 and 1804. During the three succeeding years, ten more were erected in Rhode Island, and one in Connecticut, making alto gether fifteen mills erected before the year 1808, working at that time about 8000 spindles, and producing about 300,000lbs. of yarn a year. In the commencement of 1811, the number of mills amounted to eighty-seven, working 80,000 spindles; andin the year 18 18 there were"], [109, "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 93 400 water and horse mills, working 120,000 spindles. The capital required to carry on the manufacture on the best terms, is estimated at the rate of 100 dollars per spindle ; but it is believed, that no more than at the rate of sixty dollars is generally employed. Each spindle pro duces annually about thirty-six pounds of yarn from forty-five pounds of cotton ; and the value of the yam may be averaged as worth one dollar and twelve cents per lb. Eight hundred spindles employ forty persons, viz. five men and thirty-five women and children. But by far the greater part of the goods made of cotton, wool, and flax, are manufactured in private families, mostly for their own use, and partly for sale. They consist prin cipally of coarse cloth, flannel, cotton stuffs, and stripes of every description, linen, and mixtures of wool, with flax and cotton. It is calculated that at least two-thirds of the clothing, and house and table linen ofthe inhabitants of the United States, who do not reside in seaports, is made in this way. In the eastern and middle states, carding machines, worked by water, are every where established, and they are rapidly extending southwardly and westwardly. Jen nies, other family spinning machines, and flying shuttles, are also introduced in many places ; and no less than 2000 fulling mills are in full occupation. The number of looms exeeeds 400,000 ; and the number of yards of cloth made from wool, flax, and cotton, is about 100,000,000. There are 300 gunpowder mills, the en- couragement given by the government to its manufacture, has rendered it an article of extensive importance. The manufactures of wood are cabinet wares, house- hold furniture, carriages of every kind, ship-building, and pot and pearl ashes. Those of le uther are boots, shoes, harness and saddles. Soap and tallow candles are manu- factured both in establishments and in families. Iron abounds in the United States : 50,000 tons of bar iron are consumed annually, of which 40,000 are manufactured at home, and 10,000 imported. Sheet, slit, and hoop iron are almost wholly of home manufacture : as are cut nails, .300 tons of which are annually exported. Cutlery, and"], [110, "94 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. the finer specimens of hardware and steel work, are still imported from Britain. Of the copper and brass manu- factured, the zinc is chiefly, and the copper wholly, im- ported. Plated work is made in large quantities in Phi- ladelphia, New York, Boston, Baltimore, and Charleston. The manufactures of gunpowder, coarse earthenware, window glass, glass bottles, and glass decanters, nearly supply the home market. 1,000,000 bushels of salt are made annually, and three times the quantity imported. White crockery ware is made in Philadelphia of as good quality as any in England. Saltpetre is manufactured largely in Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Massa- chusetts. Sugar from the maple-tree is made in Ohio, Kentucky, Vermont, and Tennessee, to the amount of 10,000,000 of pounds annually. Twenty five millions of gallons of ardent spirits are distilled and consumed yearly in the United States. The following is a brief summary of the particular ma- nufactures carried on in the different states ofthe Union, which will be described more in detail under the head of each state respectively. In the state of Vermont the chief manufactures are of iron, lead, pipeclay, marble, distilleries, maple-sugar, flour, and wool.\u2014 In Massachusetts, the principal manu- factories are duck, cotton, woollen, cut nails, (by a ma- chine capable of cutting 200,000 in a day,) paper, cotton, and wool cards, playing cards, shoes, silk ancl thread lace, wire, snuff, oil, chocolate, and powder-mills, iron works, and slitting mills, and mills for sawing lumber grinding grain, and fulling cloth, distilleries, and glass works.\u2014 In Rhode Island are manufactured cotton, linen, and tow cloth, iron, spirits, wool and cotton cards, paper, spermaceti, sugar, machines for cutting screws, and fur- naces for casting hollow ware.\u2014 In Connecticut are ma- nufactured silk, wool, card-teeth, (bent and cut by a ma- chine to the number of 86,000 in an hour,) linen, buttons, cotton, glass, snuff, powder, iron, paper, oil, and very superior fire-arms\u2014In New York are manufactured wheel carnages of all kinds; the common manufactures are, refined sugar, potter's ware, umbrellas, musical in-"], [111, "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 95 struments, glass, iron, and steam-boats. \u2014 in New Jersey are numerous tanneries, leather manufactories, ironworks, powder mills, cotton, paper, copper, and lead mines, stone and slate quarries. \u2014 In Pennsylvania there are valuable colleries, distilleries, rope-walks, sugar-houses, hair-pow der works, iron founderies, shot manufactories, steam engines, mill machinery, pneumatic cock for tapping air tight casks, hydrostatic blow-pipe, carpet manufactories, type founderies, and improved printing. \u2014 In Delaware there are cotton, bolting-cloth, and powder manufactories, fulling, snuff, slitting, paper, grain, and saw-mills. \u2014 In Marylandare ironworks, colleries, grist-mills, glass works, stills, and paper-mills. \u2014 In Virginia there are lead mines, which yield abundantly, iron mines, copper mines, vast colleries, and marble quarries. \u2014 In Kentucky are manu factured cotton, wire, paper, oil, bagging, wool ; there are also fulling-mills and colleries. \u2014 In Ohio ship-build ing is carried on to a great extent ; indeed, in this branch of manufactures the Americans excel ; flour in great quantities. \u2014 In North Carolina the pitch-pine affords ex cellent pitch, tar, turpentine, and lumber ; there are also iron works and a gold mine, which has furnished the mint of the United States with a considerable quantity of vir gin gold. In South Carolina there are gold, silver, lead, black-lead, copper, and iron mines ; as also pellucid, stones of different hues, coarse cornelian, vangated mar ble, nitrous stone and sand, red and yellow ochres,potter's clay, fuller's earth, a number of die stuffs, chalk, crude alum, sulphur, nitre, ancl vitriol. \u2014 In Louisiana, are ma nufactured cotton, wool, cordage, shot, and hair-powder ; in both the latter states, the manufacture of sugar from cane thrives well, and is increasing rapidly. But the most extraordinary, and most important ma nufacture in the United States, and perhaps in the world, is that of steam-boats. Whoever may have first applied the force of steam to the purposes of navigation, it is cer tain that no one perfectly succeeded in the attempt prior to Mr. Fulton ; which is proved by the fact, that since the accomplishment of this plan in America, the use of steam-boats has become common in Europe ; whereas, be-"], [112, "96 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. fore that period, every endeavour to navigate boats by Steam was vain and fruitless. In the year 1807\u00bb the first American steam-boat plied between the cities of New York and Albany ; and since that time, this mode of na vigation has been practised with great success in many other rivers of the Union besides the Hudson. At pre sent many steam boats, and a great number of barges, are in active operation upon the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers, hitherto almost unnavigable, except in the direction of their currents. The painful, laborious, and tedious me thod of ascending those rivers with barges, was always attended with great difficulty and danger. From twelve to sixteen days were usually consumed in the passage from New Orleans to Natchez, a distance of 322 miles. Steam boats, by stemming the current at the rate of four miles an hour, and going in motion twelve hours a day, will perform the same voyage in less than half the time, ln other places the difference is still greater. Albany is brought within twenty-four hours of New York, 169 miles distant, instead of averaging five days as formerly, viz. three days by water and two by land. In countries where fuel abounds, and where the streams are rapid, steam-boats are an invaluable acquisition to the inha bitants ; and the facility, economy, and despatch of tra velling are all wonderfully augmented by steam navigation. The following table exhibits the great benefit derived to the traveller from this invention, and the cheapness of travelling ; since, it is to be observed, that Jood as well as conveyance is included in this charge : In the spring of 1817, a steam-boat reached Louisville, in Kentucky, from Pittsburgh, in Pennsylvania, a distance Miles.1 H OUTS.

She dis played her vast power by different tacks in the strongest current on the falls, and returned over the falls, stemming the force of the current with much ease. About the same time, a large steam-boat arrived at Louisville from New Orleans, having ascended against the stream 1720 miles, with a valuable cargo of wines, sugar, coffee, raisins, sheet lead, fur, earthenware, &c. exceeding in value 25,000 dollars. On the 3 1st of March, 1818, the steam-boat Vesuvius arrived at the same place from New Orleans in twenty-six days, laden with coffee, sugar, and dry goods, carrying also a number of passengers. On her voyage she met seven steam-boats in their progress down the river ; but since that period the number of these vessels has considerably increased, and the time employed in their navigation is so much lessened, that one of them has been known to proceed from Louisville to New Orleans, and back again, 3440 miles, in less than forty days. The use of steam, applied to navigation, has effectually removed those obstacles which the length and rapidity of the Mississippi presented to boats pro pelled by personal labour alone ; and the property freighted, is infinitely less liable to damage and is trans ported at less than one-half the cost of the route across the mountains from the states lying east ofthe Alleganies. Hence it does not seem extraordinary to expect, that in due time steam-boats will find their way from the Atlantic ocean into the great inland seas of the United States, by the completion of the grand canal to connect the waters ofthe Hudson River with Lake Erie ; and from the lakes will carry their treasures to the Gulf of Mexico. Agriculture. \u2014 The three great national objects of go vernment in the United States are, the encouragement of agriculture, commerce, and manufactures. The rich ness of the soil, which amply rewards the industrious husbandman ; the temperature of the climate, which admits of steady labour ; the cheapness of land, which induces emigration from all countries ; render agriculture the great leading interest in America. This fuinishes outward cargoes, not only for all their own ships, but for"], [114, "98 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. those also which foreign nations send to their ports ; or, in other words, it pays for all their importations ; it sup plies a great part of the clothing of the inhabitants, and food for them and their cattle. What is consumed at home, including the materials for rnanufasturing, is four or five times the value of what is exported. The number of people employed in agriculture, is at least three-fourths of all the inhabitants of the United States ; some say more. It follows of course, that they form the great body of the militia, which now consists of more than 800,000 men, and is the bulwark of the re public. The value of the property occupied by agri culture, is many times greater than that employed in every other way. The settlement of waste lands, the subdivision of farms, and the numerous and daily improvements in husbandry, annually increase the supe riority of the agricultural interest. The resources de rived from it are at all times certain, and indispensably necessary ; besides, the rural life promotes health by its active nature, and morality, by keeping the people at a distance from the luxuries and vices of populous towns. In short, agriculture is the spring of their commerce, and the parent of their manufactures. The following extract from Mr. Jefferson's elegant and interesting c1 __> \" Notes on Virginia,\" will throw additional light on the subject of American agriculture. \" The political economists of Europe have established it as a principle, that every nation should endeavour to ma nufacture for itself ; and this principle, like many others, is applied to America, without calculating the difference of circumstance, which should often produce a different result. In Europe, the lands are either cultivated or locked up against the cultivator. Manufactures must therefore be resorted to of necessity, not of choice, to support the surplus of their people. But we have an im mensity of land, courting the industry of the husbandman. It is best then that allourcitizensshould be employed in its improvement, or that one-half should be called off from that, to exercise manufactures and handicraft arts for the"], [115, "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 99 other? Those who labour in the earth ure the chosen peo ple of God, if ever he had a chosen people, whose breasts he has made his peculiar deposit for substantial and genu ine virtue. It is the focus in which he keeps alive that sacred fire, which otherwise might escape from the earth. Corruption of morals in the mass of cultivators, is a phe nomenon of which no age nor nation has furnished an ex ample. It is the mark set on those, who, not looking up to heaven, to their own soil and industry, (as does the hus bandman) for their subsistence, depend upon the casual ties and caprice of customers. Dependence begets subser vience and venality, suffocates the germ of virtue, and prepares fit tools for the designs of ambition. This, the natural progress and consequence of the arts, has some times, perhaps, been retarded by accidental circumstan ces ; but, generally speaking, the proportion which the whole of the other classes of citizens bears in any country to that of its husbandmen, is the proportion of its unsound to its healthy parts, and is a good enough barometer whereby to measure its degree of corruption. The rapid increase of a healthy and vigorous popula tion implies a flourishing state of agriculture, and accord ingly, the United States, except the year 1808, (when the embargo existed) and 1814, in addition to maintaining their own fast-growing population, have, on an average, exported one-Jourth of their agricultural produce. As a science, agriculture is improving rapidly; and societies for its further improvement are established in Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania, and some other states. These societies have diffused much practical knowledge on the modes of tillage, pasture, and grazing best adapted to the different districts of the Union. If the system of farming followed in America be inferior to that practised in Eu rope, it does not proceed merely from a want of know ledge ; it is from their having such quantities of land to waste as they please. The chief articles of agricultural export are wheat, flour, rice, Indian corn, rye, beans, peas, potatoes, beef, tallow, hides, butter, cheese, pork, &c. horses, mules, no. v o"], [116, "100 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. sheep, tobacco, cotton, indigo, flax-seed, wax, &c. \u2014 The following statement shows the value of these exports, constituting vegetable food only, in particular years, viz. In 1802, 12,790,000 dois;\u2014 1803, 14,080,000 dois. 1807, 14,432,000 dois. ;\u2014 1808, 2,550,000 dois.;\u2014 1811, 20,391,000 dois. ;\u2014 1814, 2,179,000 dois.;\u2014 1515, 11,231,000 dois. ;\u2014 & in 1816, 13,150,000 dois. Agriculture is the base of every civilized society ; and the farmers of the United states enjoy many advantages superior to those enjoyed by the same class any where else in the world. Almost every farmer is a freeholder ; and a continuation of that incalculable advantage is se- cured by the plan adopted by the general government for the disposal ofpublic lands. These lands, with some exceptions to be noticed hereafter, originally consisted of the whole ofthe country north and west of the Ohio, to the Mississippi; and a considerable portion south of Ten- nessee and west of Georgia, to that river. These coun- tries are now subdivided into states and territories, and consist of the states of Ohio, Indiana, and Mississippi ; and the Michigan, Illinois, and north-west territories. The purchase of Louisiana from France, has added an amazing extent of country to the general fund. To ena- ble the reader to trace the subject with great facility, the following short view- of the present state of the public lands is annexed ; and the mode adopted by congress for their disposal, is a matter of great public interest, not only to the present citizens of the United States, but to the world at large ; for all the inhabitants of the earth may avail themselves of whatever advantages may result from it. * \u2022 As many persons have been disappointed in their expectations of becoming citizens at the time they wished, it may not be improper in this place to give an abstract ofthe law upon the subject. The act was past on the 14th of April, 1802 The first step necessary to be taken in virtue of this act, is to make a registry of the intention to become a citizen, and obtain a certificate thereof. This can be done in the district court were the person arrives ; and the clerk of the court is en titled to charge fifty cents for the register, and fifty cents more for the certificate. This preliminary step is absolutely necessary, for it is expressly declared, that \"such certificate shall be exhibited to the court by every alien who may arrive in the United Sates, after the passing of this act, on his application to be naturalized, as eviilence of the time of his arrival in the United States.\" As it is obvious from hence, that no person can be admitted a citizen sooner than five years after making this report ; those who wish to avail themselves ofthe inestimable privilege of becoming a citizen ofthe United States, should not delay the report a single day"], [117, "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 101 In the stateof Ohio, the United States holds the whole of the unsold lands, with the exception ofthe Connecticut Reservation, on Lake Erie ; the Virginia military lands, between the Scioto ancl little Miama Rivers ; and the north-west section, where the Indian title is not yet ex tinguished, and of which the United States hold the pre-emption right, t In Indiana, the United States hold all the unsold lands below the Indian boundary-line, exhibited on the map ac companying this work ; and they hold the pre-emption right of all above it. In the Illinois territory, they hold all the unsold lands beyond the Indian boundaries, as marked on the map ; and the pre-emption right of the remainder. In the Michigan territory, they hold all the unsold lands within the Indian boundary-line, distinguished on the map ; and the pre-emption of the rest. In the north-west territory, they hold all the unsold lands ceded by the Sac and Fox Indians, as shown on the map ; and the pre-emption right of the remainder. In the state of the Mississippi and Albama territories, they hold all the lands within the Indian boundary-line on the south, and a considerable portion in the northern part ; and they hold the pre-emption right to all the re mainder. The next necessary step is, to make oath, or affirmation, that it is the real inten tion to become a citizen of the Union, and to renounce allegiance to every foreign power. This oath or affirmation can be made either before the supreme, superior, district, or circuit court of any one of the states or territories j or a circuit or dis trict court of the United States : and it must be done three years at least before the person can be admitted. The best method is, for the person making the appli cation, to make the oath or affirmation at the same time he declares his intention; and in this way no time will be lost. \u2014 The foregoing steps being taken, the per son is entitled, at the end of five years, from the date of the registry of his inten tion, (having taken the oaths within the time prescribed by law) to claim the right of citizenship. This to be obtained from any ofthe courts aforesaid ; but before it is granted, the court must be satisfied that the person has resided five at least in the United States, (and, mark well, that in addition lo other proofs, it is necessary to produce the record of registry aforesaid) and ene year at least, in the state or territory where such court is held. They must also be satisfied, \"that he has behaved as a man of good moral character, that he is attached to the principles of the constitutions of the United States ;' and well disposed to the good order and happiness of the same.\" He must also declare on oath or affirmation, that he will support the constitution ofthe said States: and that he renounces allegiance to every foreign power. f The pre-emption right, is tbe exclusive right to purchase from the Indians."], [118, "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 102 In the state of Louisiana, they hold a very conside rable portion of lands; and in the Missouri territory thev hold the whole ofthe unsold lands, with the excep tion of those grants made by the court of Spain before they obtained the sovereignty. . In estimating the resources of the country in the year 1808, with a view to the execution of a plan for its in ternal improvement, it was stated in the report of the then secretary of the treasury, that \u00bb Exclusively of Lou isiana, the general government possessed in trust for the people ofthe United States, about 100,000,000 of acres fit for cultivation, north of the River Ohio, and near 50,000,000 south of the state of Tennessee. Although considerable sales have been made since that time, yet there have also been considerable acquisitions by purchase from the Indians, so that the quantity is not really dimin ished.* There are at least 150,000,000 of acres of ex cellent land, belonging to the public, east of the Missis sippi ; and there is every reason to believe that as much more will soon be surveyed, and ready for sale and set tlement beyond that river. Here then, to say nothing of the more remote part of the country, are 300,000,000 of acres, fit for cultivation, the property of the govern- ment, held in trust for the nation, in one of the finest climates, watered by the noblest rivers, and possessing natural advantages second to no country on the face of the earth. In remarking on this subject, the secretary ofthe treasury, in his report before quoted, states, \" For the disposition of these lands, a plan has been adopted calculated to enable every industrious citizen to become a freeholder, lo secure indisputable titles lo the pur- chasers, to obtain a national revenue, and, above all, to suppress monopoly.\" The reader will naturally be desirous of hearing how these land sales are carried on by the American govern- ment, and how the vast tracts of territory at its disposal \u25ba An account of the lands purchased from the Indians by the United Statesat different periods, with the sums paid and annuities granted to them for such pur chases ; and also an estimate of the public lands remaining unsold by the latest official' report, will be found in the Appendix to this work."], [119, "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 103 are parceled out to new settlers. The plan is this : the country is divided into counties of about twenty miles square, and townships of six miles square; which are again divided into sections of a mile square, and these further subdivided into haif and quarter sections, and, in particu lar situations, into half quarters. Each township, there fore, being thirty-six square miles, contains 23,0 10 acres, and a section, 610 acres. The townships are numbered in ranges from north to south, and the rauges are numbered from east to west; and lastly, the sections in each township are marked numerically. All these lines are well defined by the axe in the woods, by marks on the trees. When this is done, public notice is given, and the lands in ques tion put up to auction, excepting the sixteenth section in every township, which being near the centre, is uniformly destined for the support of one or more schools for the use of the township ; and the three adjacent sections are reserved by the government, for charitable and other pur poses. There are also sundry reserves of entire town ships, for the support of seminaries of learning upon an extended scale. No government lands are sold under two dollars per acre ; indeed they are put up at that price, in quarter sections, at the auction, and if there be no bidding, they are passed over. The best lands, and most favourable situations, are sometimes run up to ten or twelve dollars, and in some late instances much higher. The lots which remain unsold, are from time to time open to the public, at the price of two dollars per acre, one-fourth to be paid down, and the remaining three-fourths to be paid by in stalments in five years ; at which time, if the payments are not completed, the lands revert to the state, and the advances already made are forfeited. When a purchaser has fixed upon one or more vacant quarters, he repairs to the land-office, pays eighty dollars for each quarter, and receives a certificate, as the basis of the complete title, which will be given him when he pays all : this he may do immediately, if convenient, and re ceive eight per cent, interest for prompt payment. If the whole is paid in cash, the price is only one dollar and"], [120, "104 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. sixty-four cents per acre. The sections thus sold are marked on the general plan, which is always open at each land-office to public inspection, with the letters A. P, \" advance paid.\" There is a receiver and a register at each land-office, which are checks on each other, and are remunerated by a per centage on the receipts. These land-offices are distributed as follows ; viz. : In Ohio, at Wooster, Stenbenville, Marietta, Zanes ville, Chilicothe, and Cincinnati. \u2014 In Indiana, at Jeffer sonville and Vicennes. \u2014 In the Michigan territory, at Detro _. \u2014 In the Illinois territory, at Shawnee-town, Kaskaskias, and Edwardsville. \u2014 In the Missouri territory, at St. Louis. \u2014 ln Louisiana, at New Orleans, and Ope. lousas. \u2014 In the state of Mississippi, at Washington, twelve miles from Natchez ; and in the Albama territory, at St. Stephen's, east ofthe Pearl River, and Huntsville, Madison county. All these offices are under the direc tion ofthe surveyor-general, who makes periodical returns to the commissioner of the land-office at the city of Washington. In this chief office all the surveys and re cords of the public lands are deposited ; and all titles are issued from thence, signed by the president of the United States. When a person has, in the manner above described, obtained possession of a portion of land, with part of it a prairie* it only wants fencing, and water for the live stock, to make at once rich pasture land ; and from this to arable land the transition is easy, expeditious, and pro fitable as it proceeds. The whole cost of purchase, fencing, and watering, that is, of buying the land, and \u2022 Prairie is the American name for a natural meadow, destitute of trees. There are two kinds of these meadows ; the river and upland prairies : the first are found upon the margin of rivers, and are level bottoms without any timber ; most of these exhibit appearances of former cultivation. , The last are plains, from thirty to 100 feet higher than the bottoms, and are far more numerous and extensive; but are indefinite in size and figure ; since some are not larcer than a common field, while others expand beyond the reach of the eye, or the limits ofthe horizon. One of these prairies, between the River Mississippi and the Rocky Mountains, is not less than 1,250 miles in length, and above 1,000 in breadth ! They are usually bounded by groves of lofty trees ; and sometimes adorned with copses and clumps of small trees, affording an agreeable shelter to man and beast. In spring and summer they are covered with a luxuriant growth of grass and fragrant flowers, from four to eight feet high, through which it is very fatiguing to force one's way so as to make any progress. The soil of these immense plains is often as deep and fertile as tbat of the best bottoms."], [121, "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 105 then making it begin to yield a profit, is only eighteen shillings sterling per acre. The cost of building and stocking is of course more difficult to estimate ; but it has been calculated by a distinguished writer on that subject, that 2,000/. sterling would suffice for 6 10 acres : so that for 3000/. an English farmer who was but indif ferently off on a farm of six or 700/ a year rent, may find himself owner of a fine estate of six or 700 acres in America, capable of almost unlimited improvement. In a work of this description, and under the article agriculture, the following observations of an American citizen on the progress of population, husbandry, man ners, &c. transcribed from the Columbian Magazine, are too important to be omitted. These remarks were written with a view to the settlers in Pennsylvania ; but they are equally applicable to the improvement of set tlements in all the new countries of the United States. \" The first settler in the woods is generally a man who has out-lived his credit or his fortune in the cultivated parts of the state. His time for migrating is in the month of April ; and his first object is to build a cabin of rough logs for himself and family. The floor of this cabin is earth, the roof of split logs ; the light is received through the door, and in some instances, through a small window made of greased paper. A coarser building adjoining this cabin affords a shelter to a cow, and a pair of poor horses. The labour of erecting these buildings is suc ceeded by killing the trees on a few acres of ground near bis cabin ; this is done by cutting a circle round each tree, two or three feet from the ground ; which is then ploughed, and Indian corn planted in it. The season lor planting this grain is about the 20th May. It grows generally on new ground, with but little cultivation, and yields in the month of October following, from forty to fifty bushels an acre. After the first of September it af fords a good deal of nourishment to his family in its green or unripe state, in the form of what is called roasting ears. His family is fed during the summer by a small quantity of grain, which he carries with him, and by fish"], [122, "106 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. and game. His cows and horses feed upon wild grass\", or the succulent twigs ofthe woods. \" For the first year he endures a great deal of distress, from hungei, cold, and a variety of accidental causes; but he seldom complains, and seldomer sinks under them. As he lives in the neighbourhood of Indians, he soon ac- quires a strong tincture of their manners. His exertions, while they continue, are violent ; but they are succeeded by long intervals of rest . His pleasnres consist chiefly of fishing and hunting. He loves spirituous liquors, and he eats, drinks, and sleeps in dirt and rags, in his little cabin. In his intercourse with the world, he manifests all the arts which characterize the Indians. In this situa- tion he passes two or three years. In proportion as popu- lation increases around him, he becomes uneasy and dis- satisfied. Formerly his cattle ranged at large, but now his neighbours call upon him to confine them within fences ; to prevent their trespassing upon their fields of grain. Formerly he fed his family upon wild animals; but these, which fly from t he face of man, now cease to afford him an easy subsistence ; and he is compelled to raise domestic animals for the support of his family. . This description of settler is generally a man of some property; he pays one-third or one -fourth part in cash for his plantation, which consists of three or 400 acres, and the rest by instalments ; that is, a certain sum yearly, without interest, till the whole is paid. The first object of this settler is to build an addition to his cabin ; and as saw-mills generally follow settlements, his floors are made of boards, and his roof is made of what are called clap- boards, wliich are a kind of coarse shingles, split out of short oak logs. This house is divided by two floors, on each of which are two rooms ; under the whole is a cellar walled with stone : the cabin serves as a kitchen to his house. His next object is to clear a little meadow ground, and plant an orchard of two or 300 apple-trees. His sta- ble is likewise enlarged ; and, in the com se of a year or two, he builds a large log barn, the roof of which is com- monly thatched with rye-straw. He moreover increases the quantity of his arable land ; and, instead of cultivating Indian corn alone, he raises a quantity of wheat and rye ;"], [123, "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 107 the latter is raised chiefly for the purpose of being dis tilled into whiskey. \" This species of settler by no means extracts all from the earth that it is able and willing to give. His fields yield but a scanty increase, owing to the ground not being sufficiently ploughed. The hopes of the year are often blasted by his cattle breaking through his half-made fences, and destroying his grain. His horses perform but half the labour that might be expected from them, if they were better fed ; and his cattle often die in the spring for want of provisions, ancl the delay of grass. His house, as well as his farm, bears many marks of a weak tone of mind. His windows are unglazed, or, if they have had glass in them, the ruins of it are supplied with old hats or wooden pot-lids. This kind of settler sometimes drinks spirituous liquors to excess, will spend a day or two in every week attending political meetings ; and thus he contracts debts which compel him to sell his planta tion, in the course of a few years, to the third and last species of settler. . This man is generally a person of property and good character ; sometimes he is the son of a wealthy farmer in one of the interior and ancient counties of the state. His first object is to convert every spot of ground, over which he is able to draw water, into meadow : where this cannot be done, he selects the most fertile spots on the farm, and devotes it by manure to that purpose. His next object is to build a barn, which he prefers of stone. This building is, in some instances, 100 feet in front, and forty in depth ; it is made very compact, so as to shut out the cold in winter ; for our farmers find that their horses and cattle, when kept warm, do not require near so much food, as when they are exposed to the cold. He uses economy, likewise, in; the consumption of his wood. Hence he keeps himself warm in winter, by means of stoves, which save an immense deal of labour to him self and his horses, in cutting and hauling wood in wet and cold weather. His fences are every where repaired, so as to secure his grain from his own and his neighbour's f"], [124, "108 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. cattle. But further, he increases the number of the articles of his cultivation ; and instead of raising Indian corn, wheat, and rye alone, he raises, in addition, oats, buck wheat, and spelts. Near his house, he allots an acre or two of ground for a garden, in which he raises a large quantity of cabbage and potatoes. His newly-cleared fields afford him every year a great increase of turnips. Over the spring which supplies him with water, he builds a milk-house ; he likewise adds to the number, and im proves the quality, of his fruit-trees : his sons work by his side all the year, and his wife and daughters forsake the dairy and the spinning-wheel, to share with him in the toils of harvest. \" The last object of his industry is to build a dwel ling house. This business is sometimes effected in the course of his life, but is oftener bequeathed to his son, or the inheritor of his plantation ; and hence we have a common saying among our best farmers, * that a son should begin where his father left off;' that is, he should begin his improvements, by building a commodious dwelling-house, suited to the value of the plantation. This dwelling-house is generally built of stone, it is large, convenient, and filled with useful and substantial furni ture ; and sometimes joins the house of the second set tler, but is frequently placed at a little distance from it. The horses and cattle of this description of settler, bear marks in their strength, figure, and fruitfulness, of their being plentifully fed, and carefully kept. His table abounds with a variety of the best provisions ; his very kitchen flows with milk and honey ; beer, cyder, and wine, are the usual drinks of his family ; and the greater part of their clothing is manufactured by his wife and daughters. In proportion as he increases in wealth, he values the protection of laws : hence he punctually pays his taxes towards the support of government. Schools and churches, likewise, as the means of promoting order and happiness in society, derive a due support from him; for benevolence and public spirit, as to these objects, are the natural offspring of affluence and independence."], [125, "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 109 Of this class of settlers are two-thirds of the fanners of Pennsylvania ; these are the men to whom Pennsyl- vania owes her ancient fame and consequence. If they possess less refinement than their southern neighbours who cultivate their lands with slaves, they possess more republican virtue. It was from the farms cultivated by these men, that the American and French armies were fed with bread during the revolutionary war ; and it was from the produce of these farms, that those millions of dollars were obtained from the Havannah after the year 1780, which laid the foundation of the Bank of North America, and which fed and clothed the American army until the peace of 1783. \" This is a short account of the happiness ofa Penn- sylvania farmer ; to this happiness our state invites meu of every religion and country. We do not pretend to offer emigrants the pleasures of Arcadia ; it is enough if affluence, independence, and happiness are insured to patience, industry, and labour. The moderate price of land, the credit which arises from prudence, ancl the safety from our courts of law, of every species of property, render the blessings which I have described, objects within the reach of every man. \" I do not pretend to say, that this mode of settling farms is universal. Instances have been known where the first settler has performed the improvements of the second, and failed to accomplish the third. There have been a few instances, also, of men of enterprising spirit, who have settled in the wilderness, and who, in the course ofa single life have advanced through all the in- termediate stages of improvement above mentioned, and produced all those conveniences which have been ascribed to the third species of settlers ; thereby resembling, in their exploits, not only the pioneers and light infantry, but the main body of an army. There are instances, likewise, where the first settlement has been improved by the same family, in hereditary succession, till it has reached the third stage of cultivation. There are many spacious stone houses, and highly cultivated farms, in the neighbouring counties to Philadelphia, which are pos\u00bb"], [126, "110 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. sessed by the grandsons and great-grandsons of men who accompanied William Penn across the ocean, and who laid the foundation of the present improvements of their posterity, in such cabins as have been described. \" This passion, strange and new as it may appear to an European, is wisely calculated for the extension of popu lation in America ; and this it does, not only by promot ing the increase of the human species in new settlements, but in the old settlements likewise. While the degrees of industry and knowledge in agriculture, in the United States, are proportioned to farms of from seventy-five to 300 acres, there will be a languor in population, as soon as farmers multiply beyond the number ot farms of the above dimensions. To remove this languor, which is kept up alike by the increase of the price, and the division of farms, a migration of part of the community becomes ab solutely necessary. And as this part of the community often consists of the idle and extravagant, who eat without working, their removal, by increasing the facility of subsistence to the frugal and industrious who remain behind, naturally increases the number of people ; just as the cutting off the suckers of an apple-tree increases the size of the tree and quantity of fruit. \" I have only to add upon this subject, that the emi grants from Pennsylvania always travel to the southward. The soil and climate of the western parts of Virginia, North and South Carolina, and Georgia, afford a more easy support to lazy farmers, than the stubborn but dur- able soil of Pennsylvania. Here our ground requires deep and repeated ploughing to render it fruitful ; there scratching the earth once or twice affords tolerable crops. \u2014In Pennsylvania, the length and coldness of the winter make it necessary for the farmers to bestow a large share of their labour in providing for, and feeding, their cattle ; but in the southern states, cattle find pasture dur- ing the greater part of the winter in the fields or woods. For these reasons, the chief part of the western counties of the states above mentioned are settled by people from Pennsylvania. During the revolutionary war, the militia of Orange county, North Carolina, were inrolled, and"], [127, "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 111 their number amounted to 3,500 ; every man of whom had migrated from Pennsylvania. \" To conclude ; in the mode of extending popula tion and agriculture just described, we behold a new species of war. The third settler may be viewed as a con queror ; and the weapons with which he achieves his conquest, are the implements of husbandry : the virtues wbich direct them are industry and economy.\" But the rise of a man's fortune, and the general pro gress of the country, is better illustrated by the history of a few individuals, whom a late intelligent traveller has judiciously selected as examples. One whom he conver sed with in the western parts of Pennsylvania, in the summer of 18 17, was \" about thirty years of age, and had a wife and three fine healthy children. His father was a farmer, that is to say, a proprietor of land, and lived five miles distant. From him he received 500 dollars, and * began the world' in the true style of American enterprise, by taking a cargo of flour to New Orleans, above 2,000 miles ; gaining a little more than his ex pences, and a stock of knowledge. Two years ago he had increased his property to 900 dollars ; purchased 250 acres of land (sixty-five of which he had cleared and laid down to grass) with a house, stable, &c. for 3,500 dollars : 3,000 of which he has already paid, and will pay the remaining 500 next year. He is now building a good stable and going to improve his house. His property is now wrorth 7,000 dollars, having gained or rather grown 3,500 dollars in two years, with prospects of future ac cumulation to his wishes.\" The same traveller, in passing throughBelmont county state of Ohio, called at the house of an Irishman, who, fourteen years before, came to the spot before an axe had ever been lifted on it, and with only his axe in his hand. He now possesses 118 acres of excellent land, well cultivated ; is the father of twenty descendants; and pays eight dollars a year in taxes, five to the general go vernment and three to his own county, in all about four pence per acre. About the same time, there came also another poor emigrant, who \" unloaded his family under"], [128, "112 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. a tree,\" on the very ground where he now possesses 200 acres of fine land, in a superior state of culture, produc ing from eighty to 100 bushels of Indian corn an acre. Such is the progress from poverty to affluence in the United States, and such the system adopted by the Ameri can government to enable every man of common prudence and diligence to acquire property and independence. Now, mark its effects: \u2014 Every industrious person, of whatever calling or profession, has the power to become a freeholder, on paying the small sum of eighty dollars ; being the first instalment on the purchase of a quarter section (160 acres) of land ; and though he should not have another shilling in the world, he can easily clear as much from the land, as will pay the remaining instal ments before they become due. This is merely taking the result of the system on the smallest scale for illustra tion. A farmer with an industrious family may become the proprietor of a whole section or more ; and the land being purely his own, there is no setting limits to his prosperity. No proud tyrant can lord it over him ; he he has no rent to pay ; no game laws ; nor timber laws ; nor fishing laws to dread. He has no taxes to pay, except his equal share for the support of the civil govern ment of the country, which is truly a trifle. He has no excise laws to oppress and harass him ; neither can he be guaged nor supervised. He has no poor rates to pay, (for poor laws, in America, have only found their way into large cities ;) and he dwells in a country where go vernment interposes not its greedy hand, to snatch the cup of industry from the lips ofthe feeble. He has no tythes to pay, as will be seen by referring to page 56 of this work. Present and proposed national improvements. \u2014 The government of the United States have attended to ob jects of national improvement with the most laudable care. During the last fifteen years numerous public works have been promoted, and many brought to a conclusion. Seve ral successful efforts have been made, and more are now in progress and in contemplation, to render the vast in ternal navigation of the Union still more complete by the"], [129, "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 113 help of canals. On this subject much valuable informa tion may be derived from the able and luminous report of Mr. Gallatin, when secretary of the treasury, on publie roads and canals ; the substance of which will be found in the subsequent pages. This report recommends to the general government to form canals, from north to south, along the Atlantic sea-coast ; to open communications between the Atlantic and western waters, and between the Atlantic waters and those of the great lakes and river St. Lawrence ; and, finally, to make interior canals wherever they may be wanted, throughout the Union. The United States possess a tide-water inland naviga tion, secure from storms and enemies, reaching from Massachusetts to the southern extremity of Georgia, and interrupted only by four necks of land ; namely, the isthmus of Barnstable, in Massachusetts ; that part of New Jersey which extends from the Raritan to the De laware and the Chesapeak ; and the low marshy tract which divides the Chesapeak from Albemarle Sound. It is needless to expatiate on the utility of such a range of internal navigation, whether in peace or war, to quicken the pace, and multiply the products of com merce ; to augment the means and magnify the resources both of offensive and defensive warfare. The inconve niences and dangers resulting from a vast extent of terri tory cannot be radically removed or prevented, except by opening speedy and easy communications through all its parts. Canals would shorten distances, facilitate com mercial and personal intercourse, and unite by a still more intimate community of interests the most remote quarters of the United States. No other single operation has so direct a tendency to strengthen and perpetuate that federal union which secures external independence, do mestic peace, and internal liberty, to the millions of freemen that are spread over a region larger than the surface of all Europe. Impressed with these truths, the congress, in February, 1817, passed a bill, appropriating a large fund for inter nal improvement. The principal features of this plan are, to perfect the communication from the district of Maine to the state of Louisiana ; to connect the great"], [130, "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 114 northern lakes with the Hudson river ; to unite a 1 the trreat commercial points on the Atlantic, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington, Richmond, Charleston, and Sa vannah, with the western states ; and complete the in tercourse between the west and New Orleans. Both the late and present president gave it as their opinion, that the federal constitution had no. given to congress any power to make internal improvements in the United States But a committee of the house of representatives reported, in December, 1817, that congress has power; first, to lay out, construct, and improve post-roads through the several states, with the assent of the respective states. Secondly, to open, construct, and im prove military roads, through the several states, with the assent of the respective states. Thirdly, to cut ca nals through the several states, with their assent, for promoting and giving security to internal commerce, and for the more safe and economical transportation of mili tary stores in the time of war ; leaving in all these cases, the jurisdictional right over the soil in the respective states. If the general government cannot aid the internal na vigation of the Union, it is in the power of the state governments to accomplish that important object at a comparatively small expence. For less than 100,000 dollars, a sloop navigation might be opened between Buf falo, on lake Erie, and the Fon-du-Lac, on lake Superior, a distance of 1,800 miles ; the only interruption being the rapids of St. Mary, between lakes Huron and Su perior. The Ohio, by one of its branches, French creek, approaches with a navigation for boats, to within seven miles of lake Erie; by the Connewango river, to within nine ; by the Musingum to the source of the Cayahoga, which falls into the lake. The Wabish river mingles its waters with those of the Miami-of-the-lakes, (see page 31) and the waters of the Illinois interweave their streams with those of lake Michigan, whence to St. Louis, in the Missouri territory, boats pass without meeting with a single postage. The principal interior canals, which have been already completed in the United States, are the Middlesex canal,"], [131, "UNFTED STATES OF AMERICA. ] 15 uniting the waters of Merrimack River with the harbour of Boston ; and the canal Carondelet, extending from Bayou St. John to the fortifications or ditch of New- Orleans, and opening an inland communication with Lake Pontchartrain. The uniting this canal by locks with the Mississippi, would, independently of other ad vantages, enable the general government to transport with facility and effect, the same naval force for the de fence of both the Mississippi and Lake Pontchartrain ; the two great avenues by which New Orleans may be approached from the sea. On the 17th of April, 1816, and 15th of April, 1817, the state legislature of New York passed acts, appointing funds for opening navigable communications between the lakes Erie and Champlain and the Atlantic ocean, by means of canals connected with the Hudson river. This magnificent work, an account of which will be given in the description of the state of New York, is already begun, and promises to make effectual progress under the auspices of the present governor of the state, Clinton, who has always been its zealous promoter and patron. Whenever this grand project shall be accom plished, and a communication actually opened by canals and locks, between lake Erie and the navigable waters of Hudson's river, and also between lake Champlain and those waters, the state of New York will soon become, in itself, a powerful empire. The following is the substance of Mr. Gallatin's re port on public improvements ; so far as relates to the different canals and roads recommended to the attention of the general government. I.

These canals are calculated for sea vessels, and should they be completed, will perfect an internal navigation from Boston to St. Mary's, in Georgia, a distance, in a direct line, of more than 1000 miles. II. Improvement of inland Navigation. Improvement of the navigation of the Susquehannah, Po tomac, James, and Santee Rivers, from the tide-waters to the highest practical point, to be effected principally by canals round the falls, where practicable, and by locks when necessary 1,500,000 Canal at the falls of Ohio, two miles long, and from sixteen to twenty-seven feet deep, twenty feet wide in bottom, and sixty-eight at top, and having three locks 300,000 Improvement of the navigation of the North River, and a canal from thence to Lake Champlain, the distance from Waterford to Skecnsborough being fifty miles 800,000 Improvement of the navigation from Albany, through the Mohawk and Oswego Rivers to Lake Ontario 2,200,000 Canal for sloop navigation round the falls of Niagara 1,000,000 D. 5,800,000 III. Turnpike Roads. A great road extending from Maine to Georgia in the general direction of the sea-coa\u00bbt and main post-road, and pass ing through all the principal sea-ports, in length 1600 miles, estimated at 3000 dollars per mile 4,800,000 Four great artificial roads from the four great western rivers, the Allegany, Monongahela, Kenhaway, and Tennessee, to the nearest corresponding Atlantic Rivers, the Susquehannah or Juniata, the Potomac, James River, and either the Santee or Savannah ; to unite on each river points from which there is a navigation downward, estimated at 100 miles each, being 400 miles, at 7000 dollars per mile 2,800,000 A post-road from tlie Tuscarawa branch of the Muskingum to Detroit, distance about 200 miles ; Another from Cincinnati to St. Louis, bv Vincennes, distance 300 miles ; And another from Nashville, in Tennessee, at Athens, in Georgia, to Natchez, distance 500 miles ; In all 1000 miles, at 200 dollars per mile 200,000 D. 7,800,000 In pointing out these lines of communication, the great geographical features of the country were solely attended to ; and, to equalize the advantages to all the states, a fund was contemplated for local improvements, amounting to 3,400,000 Which added to the sum estimated for general improvements 16,600,000 would make an aggregate of D. 20,000,000"], [133, "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 117 It was suggested that an annual appropriation of two mil lions of dollars, would accomplish all these great objects in ten years In estimating the resources of the nation, with a view to this appropriation, it was stated, that by the estimate of a peace es tablishment, computed for the years 1809\u2014 1815, the annual revenue would be j). 14,000,000 And the expenditure as follows : .Annual fund for the discharge of the national debt 4,600,000 Expences of government 3,500,000 Contingencies 400,000 8 500,000 Leaving a surplus of D. 5,500,000 It was calculated that three millions applied annually, during ten years, would arm every man in the United States ; fill the public arsenals and magazines ; erect every battery and fortification which could be manned ; and even, if thought eligible, build a navy ; leaving a surplus of 2,500,000 dollars per annum. In addition to these extensive plans of national improve ment, a memorial has been lately circulated through the states of Virginia, Kentucky, and Ohio, to be presented to the legislature of Virginia and the congress of the United States, in which it is proposed to connect the waters ofthe Cheapeak with the Gulf of Mexico. It is stated in the memorial, that James' River is capable of being made navigable for boats of considerable burden to the mouth of Dunlap's Creek, and even some miles higher by an increased expence ; that an artificial road may be formed with unusual facility, the ascent of which will not be more than an angle of five degrees with the horizon, and the length, if only carried to the nearest navigable waters of Greenbrier river, will not exceed thirty miles ; or, if extended to the navigable part of the Great Kenhaway, below the falls of that river, will not exceed 100 miles ; from which latter point, the wa ters descending with a bold but gentle current, for 100 miles, mingle with the Ohio, and afford a free navigation for boats of a large size, to the Gulf of Mexico. By this plan an inland navigation would be opened from the head of the Chesapeak to the mouth of the"], [134, "118 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. Mississippi. Should this be accomplished, and canals from the Karitan to the Delaware, and from the Dela ware to the Chesapeak (noticed in p3ge 26) be completed, there will be an inland communication from the extre mity of Vermont to New Orleans, a distance of 3,000 miles ; the expence attending these great improvements would be comparatively small, when we take into view the immense advantages resulting to the eastern and western sections of the Union. Finances, S,c of the United States. The present amount of national debt is less than 120,000,000 of dollars. This debt was chiefly contracted during the revolutionary war ; the expence of which amounted to D. 135,000,000 About one half of this expence was paid by taxes raised during the war ; the rest remained as a debt at the peace in 1783. But the amount of this debt was greatly increased, by the amazing depreciation of the paper money issued from the American treasury, which at length became so reduced in value, that one silver dollar would buy one thousand dollars in paper. In April, 1783, the specie value ofthe debt, independently of the reduction in the worth of paper money, amount ed to 42,000,375 dollars. The annual interest of this debt, 2,415,956 dollars, was not paid by congress ; and in 1790 the debt had risen to 51,124,464 dollars; and the state debts, including interest to 25, 000,000 dollars. After the establishment of the present federal constitu tion, it is recommended to government to assume the whole of this debt, amounting to above 79,000,000 dol lars, and bearing an annual interest of 4,587,444 dollars ; but congress assumed only 21,500,000 dollars of the debts of the several states, which were appropriated to each state. At the end of the year 1794, the sum total of the unredeemed debt was 76,097,468 dollars. A law had been passed for paying the interest, and also for redeeming the principal, of the debt. For dis charging the interest, the permanent duties on imported articles, the tonnage duties, and duties on home-made spirits and on stills, after reserving 600,000 dollars for"], [135, "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 119 the support of the general government, and national defence, were appropriated aud pledged. The sinking fund, for the redemption of the debt, consisted of the surplus on imports and tonnage to the end ofthe year 1770 ; the proceeds of loans not exceeding 2,000,000 dollars ; the interest on the public debt, purchased, re- deemed, or paid into the treasury, together with the surplus of money appropriated for interest ; and, lastly, the produce of the sale of public lands. This fund was placed under the management of commissioners, and the amount of debt purchased by them up to December, 1794 was 2,265,022 dollars. In 1795, congress made additions to the income of the sinking fund, and vested them in the commissioners, in trust, till the whole debt should be redeemed. At the commencement of the year 1 SOO, the total debt ofthe United States amounted to 79,*33,820 dolls. the debts contracted by the general government, from 1790 to 1800, being D. 10.7K6.100; and the debts discharged during that time being D. 8,164,232. The causes of the increase of the debt were, the extraordinary expences incurred in the wars with the Indians; 1,250,000 dollars expended in suppressing two insurrections in Penn sylvania^ account ofthe tax on whisky; above 1,500,000 dollars spent in the transactions with Algiers and the other Barbary powers ; and the still greater expences occasioned by the disputes with France, in 1798 and 1799. In 1801, the sinking fund was modified anew, and in April, 1802, congress enacted that 7,300,000 dollars ; should be appropriated annually to that fund ; which was to be applied first to paying the interest and principal of the national debt. In 1803, the amount of debt was little more than 70,000,000 dollars ; of which 32,119,211 dollars were owned by foreigners, viz. the English, 15,882,797 dollars; the Dutch, 13,693,918 dollars ; other foreigners, 2,542,495 dollars. Of the residue, particular states owned 5,603,564 dollars ; in corporated bodies in the United States, 10,096,398 dol lars ; individuals, 22.330,606 dollars."], [136, "120 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

For their claims on that government, and D. 11,250,000 to be paid in stock, at six per cent. ; the interest payable in Europe, and the principal to be dis charged by four equal annual instalments, the first be coming due in 1818. By the act of congress, November, 1803, creating this stock, D. 700,000 annually were added to the sinking fund, making its income D.8,000,000. On the lst of January, 1812, the national debt was not more than D. 45,154,489 ; the payments in redemption, from April, 1801, to this date, being D. 46,022,810. The sums received from 1801 to 1811, inclusive, appli cable to the payment of the interest and principal of the debt, was about, D. 90,000,000. In March, 1812, on the prospect of a war with Eng land, (which was declared in June following) congress passed an act, authorising a loan of D. 1 1 ,000,000, of which were obtained D. 10,184,700 ; certain banks lending D. 2,150,000, and the residue being funded. About half of this residue was obtained from banks, the rest from individuals. In 1813, the sinking fund re deemed D. 324,200 of this stock. On. the 8th of Janu ary, 1813, an act passed for raising a loan of D. 16,000,000, which was obtained chiefly from individuals, at the rate of eighty-eight for D. 100 ; consequently the stock issued for this loan amounted to D. 18,109,377- By an act of August 2, in the same year, a further loan of D. 7\u00bb500,000 was authorised, which was raised hy giving for every D. 100 received, stock to the amount of D. 113-p-^Q at six per cent. : the stock issued on this loan was D. 8,498,583. In March, 1814, a loan of D. 25,000,000 was authorised; but only D. 11,400,000 could be raised, for which D. 14,262,351 of stock was issued. The terms of these loans were so extremely disadvan tageous to government, and proved its want of credit to such a degree, that stocks fell thirty per cent. No more of the last loan could be raised, and treasury notes were"], [137, "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 121 issued to make up the deficiency. On all these loans, the money received by government was only D. 42,934,700, for which D. 48,905,012 stock was issued : making a dif ference of D. 5,970,312 against the treasury. In addi tion to this, New York and Philadelphia had lent money to government, for which D. 1,100,009 of stock was issued, making the whole stock funded on these loans to be D. 50,105,022. Treasury notes were issued to the amount of D. 18,452,S00. The ascertained debt, in curred by the late war, in February, 1815, was D. 68,783,622,to which add the old debt of D.39,905, 183, and the total is D. 10S,688,805, to which must be added out-standing debts to the amount of D. 13,000,000, and the total debt will be D. 121,688,805. On the 24th of February, 1815 the issue of D. 25,000,000 of treasury notes was authorised ; and on the 3d of March following, a loan of D. 18,452,800 was ordered to be made in the treasury notes previously issued. The sinking-fund, as has been already noticed, consists of an annual appropriation of D. 8,000,000, arising from the interest of the debt redeemed, which in 1813 amoun ted to D. 1,932,107 ; from the sale of public lands, and from the duties on imports and tonnage. This fund, on the 1st of January, 1814, had redeemed ofthe national debt D. 33,873,463. In March, 1817, the sinking fund income was raised to D. 10,000,000. The revenues of the United States, previous to the late war with England, were derived from duties and taxes on imports, tonnage of ships and vessels, stills, and spirits distilled within the Union, postage, tax on patents, dividends on bank stock, snuff manufactured in the United States, sugar refined there, sales at auction, wine and spirit licences, carriages, stamped paper, direct taxes, and sales of public lands ; but the chief part of the re venue has been derived from duties on imports and ton nage.

It has been already stated, that duties had been laid upon American spirits and stills ; and that other internal taxes had been also imposed, all of which were discon tinued. The sums paid on these internal taxes, from their commencement in 1790, to September, 1812, were D.6,460,003, of which D, 1,048,033 were paid in 1801 ; and in 1812, only D.4,903. Although these internal duties were repealed in 1S02, their collection has never yet been completed. At the commencement ofthe year 1812, the balances due on the internal revenue, in the several states, amounted to D.2,5 4,940. In the summer of 1813, an act was passed for renew ing the internal duties, by taxes on stills and boilers, car riages, retailers of foreign merchandise, wines and spirits, auctions, refined sugar, and stamped paper. These duties were double their former amount on most ofthe articles, and three times that rate on retail licences. The original plan of govemment was, to carry on the war by loans, af ter the English practice, and to lay on no more taxes than would just defray the current expenses ofthe state, pay the interest ofthe public debt, and of new loans, amount ing to about D. 9,000,000. This was to be raised by doubling the duties on imports, and laying twenty cents a bushel on salt ; by sales of public lands ; by a direct tax of D.3,000,000 ; and D.2,000,000 by a tax on stills, spirits, refined sugar, retail licences, auctions, carriages, and stamped paper. These taxes commenced on the lst of January, 1814, and the sum raised by them in the course of that year, amounted to D.3,2 12,491. In Sep tember of the same year, additional duties were laid on spirits, retail licences, carriages, auctions, and stamped paper.

At the beginning ofthe year IS 17, the internal duties remaining were, on stills and boilers, retail licences, on carriages, refined sugar, auctions, stamped paper, and bank notes ; but in Decem ber of that year, the congress passed a law repealing the whole of these duties, so that at present the United States have no internal taxes. The policy of this measure, how ever, has been much controverted by several able writers; as being contrary to the practice of all nations, and in di rect opposition to the best principles of political economy. In July, 1798, the first direct tax, amounting to D.2,000,000, was laid upon the people of the United States. This tax was laid upon all dwelling-houses, lands, and slaves between twelve and fifty years of age, within the United States.

The estimated receipts for 1818, from imports and tonnage, amount to twenty millions of dollars ; internal revenues, two mil lions and a half ; public lands, a million and a half; bank dividends ancl incidental receipts, half a million ; making a total of twenty-four millions and a half. The annual permanent expenditure for the support of the civil go vernment, army and navy, as now established by law, amounts to eleven millions eight hundred thousand dollars ; and for the sinking fund, ten millions, leaving an annual excess of revenue beyond the expenditure, of two millions seven hundred thousand dollars. The whole of the Louisiana debt may be redeemed in 1819 ; after which, if the public debt continues above par, five mil lions of the sinking fund will be annually unexpended, until 1825, when the loan of 1S12 and the stock created by funding treasury notes, will be redeemable. The Mis sissippi stockalso willprobably be discharged during 1819, from the proceeds of public lands ; after which, those proceeds will annually add to the public revenue a million and a half, making the permanent yearly revenue amount to twenty-six millions of dollars, leaving an excess of income, above the expenditure, of more than four mil lions of dollars."], [143, "127 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

D.7,200,000,000 Naval and military strength. \u2014 The establishments of the navy and army, in the United States, are wisely kept upon a moderate scale; particularly that of the regular mi litary force. To aspire at such a navy as the principal maritime powers of Europe possess, would be a useless waste of revenue in so young a country. As they have no possessions to protect abroad, nor any views of ex tending their dominions by foreign conquest, it is deemed sufficient, that ships enough be kept to repel any hostile attempt of those nations of Europe that are weak on the sea ; because circumstances exist, which render even the stronger ones weak as to them. Providence has placed the richest and most defenceless European possessions at the very door of the United States, and obliges its most valuable commerce to pass by their shores. To protect either of these, a small part only of any European navy would ever be detached across the Atlantic ; and the danger to which the elements expose them there, have been too often fatally experienced by the principal powers of Europe. Hence a small naval force will at all times be sufficient to cope with such detachments, as well as to protect the American territory, and annoy the commerce of their enemies. At the beginning of the year 1812, previous to the commencement of the late war, the United States navy consisted of three ships of 44 guns, three of 36, four of 32, one of 24, four of 18, three of 16, four of 14, one of 12, guns, and one schooner, besides gun-boats, bombs, &c. Of this number the British captured one of 44 guns, one of 36, three of 32, one of 18, two of 1 6, three of 14, and one of 12 guns. At present (1818) the American navy consists of five ships of 74 guns, and four of the same rate building ; six of 44, and several others building ;"], [145, "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 129 three of 36, two of 32, one of 2S, three of 21, two of 20, thirteen of 18, seven of 16, three of 14, seven of 12, and five of ten guns, besides thirty-eight of a smaller rate.* The chief part of the above naval force, now in commis sion, is employed in maintaining a strong squadron in the Mediterranean, and another in the gulf of Mexico. The military strength of the United States lies princi pally in a well-disciplined militia, which in December 1817, amounted to 800,000 men, infantry, artillery, and cavalry ; the greater part being then armed, and mea sures adopted to arm the whole. At the same period the regular troops had been raised to the number appointed by law, viz. 10,000 men. This little army is divided and stationed in garrisons along the Atlantic coast, from the district of Maine to St. Mary's, in Georgia, a distance of nearly 2000 miles ; and on the west, from the great north ern lakes to New Orleans, a still greater distance. But it is to the energy and exertions of their militia that the peo ple of the United States chuse to depend, in case of war ; rather than risk the introduction of a standing army, that bane of public liberty. Upon the whole, it must appear obvious, that the United States are now perfectly capable of maintaining their independence ; nor is there any sin gle nation, however powerful, mad enough to make an at tack, which would infallibly end in disaster and disgrace. Constitution and government. \u2014 The origin ofthe pre sent system of government in the United States, had its rise from a general congress which first assembled at Phi ladelphia, in October, 1774, and was composed of dele gates chosen by the houses of representatives of each of the thirteen oki colonies, except Georgia. This colony having afterwards acceded, the number of members amounted to fifty-four, and a president. In July, 1776, congress, by a solemn act, renounced allegiance to the king of Great Britain, and declared the American colonies to * The American ships of war always carry more guns than their rate implies. S\u00bbe page 66 of this Work-"], [146, "130 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. be free and independent states. At the same time they published articles of confederation and perpetual union be tween the states, in which they took the style of \" The United States of America\"; and decreed, that each state should retain its sovereignty and independence, and every other power and right not delegated to congress. By these articles, the thirteen United States severally entered into a firm league of friendship, for the security of their liberties, and for their general defence. It was likewise determined, that delegates should be appointed annually, to meet in congress on the first Monday in No vember of every year. No state was to send less than two, or more than seven delegates ; and no person could be a delegate more than three years ; nor was he capa ble of holding any office under the United States, or to receive salary, fees, or emoluments of any kind. In de termining questions in congress, each state was to have one vote ; and every state was bound by the decisions of congress. These articles of confederation, after eleven years ex perience, being found inadequate to the purposes for which they were intended, delegates were chosen iu each ofthe United States to meet and fix upon the necessary amendments. They accordingly met in convention at Philadelphia in the summer of 1787, when a new consti tution was adopted, of which the following are the outlines: The Legislative power is vested in a congress of the United States, consisting ofa senate and house of repre sentatives. The members ofthe house of representatives are cho sen every second year by the people of th\u00a9 several states ; and the electors in each state must have the qualifications requisite for the electors ofthe most numerous branch of the state legislature. A representative must be twenty-five years of age, and have been seven years a citizen of the United States ; and be an inhabitant of that state for which he shall be chosen. The representatives will hereafter be chosen in the several states in the proportion of one for"], [147, "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 131 every 35,000, in which enumeration the Indians and two fifths of the people of colour are not included. The senate is composed of two members from each state, chosen for six years by the respective state legisla tures ; and the seats of one-third are vacated every two years. A senator must be thirty years osage, and have beeu nine years a citizen of the United States, and at the time of his election an inhabitant of the state for which he is chosen. The vice-president ofthe United States is president of the senate, but has no vote unless they are equally divided. Congress must assemble at least once every year. Their meetings shall be on the first Monday in December, unless they shall by law appoint a different day. No law can be passed without the concurrence of both houses. When that is obtained, it is presented to the president, who, if he approves, signs it ; if not, he re turns it, with his objections, for the reconsideration of congress, and it cannot in that case become a law without the concurrence of two-thirds ofthe members. The pre sident must return it within ten days, otherwise it be comes a law without his approbation. The congress have power \u2014 I.

No money shall be drawn from the treasury, but in consequence of appropriations made by law and a regular statement and account of the receipts and expenditures of all public money shall be published from time to time."], [149, "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 13S No title of nobility shall be granted by the United States ; and no person holding any office of profit or trust under them, shall, without the consent of congress, ac cept of any present, emolument, office, or title, of any kind whatsoever, from any king, prince, or foreign state. No state shall enter into any treaty, alliance, or confe deration ; grant letters of marque and reprisal ; coin mo ney ; emit bills of credit ; make any thing but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts ; pass any bill of attainder, ex post facto law, or law impairing the obli gation of contracts, or grant any title of nobility. No state shall, without the consent of congress, lay any imposts or duties on imports or exports, except what may be absolutely necessary for executing its inspection laws ; and the net produce of all duties and imposts laid by any state on imports or exports, shall be for the use of the treasury of the United States ; and all such laws shall be subject to the revision and control of congress. No state shall, without the consent of congress, lay any duty on tonnage, keep troops or ships of war, in time of peace, enter into any agreement or compact with another state, or with a foreign power, or engage in war, unless actually invaded, or in such imminent danger as will not admit of delay. The Executive Power is vested in a president, who is elected for four years, as follows : each state appoints, in such a manner as the legislature may direct, a number of electors, equal to the whole number of senatois and representatives, which that state sends to congress. But no senator or representative, or person holding any office of trust or profit under the United States, can be an elec tor. The electors meet in their respective state, and vote by ballot for president and vice-president, one of whom, at least, shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves. The lists of the votes are sent to the seat of government, directed to the president of the senate; who, in presence of the senate and house of representatives, opens the certificates, and the votes are counted. The person having the greatest number of votes for president is declared to be elected to that office, provided he have"], [150, "131 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. the votes of .1 majority of all the electors appointed. If not, then from the persons having the greatest number of votes, not exceeding three, the house of representatives choose the president by ballot. No person except a natu ral-born citizen, or a citizen of the United States at the time of the adoption of this constitution, shall be eligible to the office of president ; and he must be 35 years osage, and have resided fourteen years within the United States. The president shall be commander in chief of the army and navy of the United States, and of the militia of the several states. When called into the actual service of the United States, he may require the opinion, in writing, of the principal officers in each of the executive depart ments, upon any subject relating to the duties of their respective offices ; and he shall have power to grant ie\u00ab prieves and pardons, for offences against the United States, except in cases of impeachment. He shall have power, by and with the advice and con sent of the senate, to make treaties, provided two-thirds of the senators present concur : and he shall nominate, and, by and with the advice and consent of the senate, shall appoint ambassadors, other public ministers, and con suls, judges of the supreme court, and all ether officers of the United States, whose appointments are not otherwise provided for, and which shall be established by law. But the .congress may, by law, vest the appointment of such inferior officers, as they think proper, in the president alone, in the courts of law, or in the heads of departments. The president shall have power to fill up all vacancies that may happen during the recess of the senate, by granting commissions, which shall expire at the end of their next session. He shall, from time to time, give to the congress information of the state to the union ; and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient. He may, on extraordinary occasions, convene both houses, or either of them ; and, in case of disagreement between them, with respect to the time of adjournment, he may adjourn them to such time as he shall think proper. He shall receive ambassa-"], [151, "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 135 dors and other public ministers. He shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed ; and shall commission all the officers ofthe United States. The judicial power of the United States shall be vested in one supreme court, and in such inferior courts, as the congress may, from time to time, ordain and establish. The judges, both of the supreme and inferior courts, shall hold their offices during good behaviour ; and shall, at stated times, receive for their services a compensation, which shall not be diminished during their continuance in office. The judicial power shall extend to all cases, in law and equity, ari .ng under this constitution, the laws of the United States, and treaties made, or which shall be made under their authority ; to all cases affecting ambas sadors, other public ministers, and consuls ; to all cases of admiralty, and maritime jurisdiction ; to controversies to which the United States shall be a party ; to contro versies between two or more states ; between a stale and citizens of another state ; between citizens of different states ; between citizens of the same state claiming lands under grants of different states ; and, between a state, or the citizens thereof, and foreign states, citizens, or subjects. In all cases affecting ambassadors, other public minis ters, and consuls, and those in which a state shall be a party, the supreme court shall have original jurisdiction. In all the other cases before mentioned,the supreme court shall have appellate jurisdiction, both as to law and fact, with such exceptions, and under such regulations, as the congress shall make. The trial of all crimes, except in cases of impeach ment, shall be by jury, and such trials shall be held in the state where the said crimes have been committed ; butwhen not committed within any state, the trial shall be at such place or places as the congress may by law have di rected. Full faith and credit shall be given in each state to the public acts, records, and judicial proceedings of every other state. And the congress may, by penal laws, pre-"], [152, "136 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. scribe the manner in which such acts, records, and pro ceedings shall be proved, and the effect tnereof. New states may be admitted by the congress into this union ; but no new state shall be formed or erected within the jurisdiction of any other state ; nor any state be formed by the junction of two or more states, without the consent of the legislatures of the states concerned, as well as of the congress. The congress shall have power to dispose of and make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory or other property belonging to the United States : and nothing in this constitution shall be so construed, as to prejudice any claims of the United States, or of any particular state. The United States shall guarantee, to every state in this union, a republican form of government ; and shall protect each of them against invasion, and on application of the legislature, or of the executive (when the legis lature cannot be convened,) against domestic violence. The senators and representatives before mentioned, and the members of the several state legislatures, and all executive and judicial officers, both of the United States, and the several states, shall be bound, by oath or affirma tion, to support this constitution ; but no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States. Congress, whenever two-thirds of both houses shall deem it necessary, shall propose amendments to the constitu tion ; or on the application of the legislatures of two thirds of the several states, shall call a convention for proposing amendments ; which in either case shall be valid, as part of the constitution, when ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several states, or by conventions in three-fourths thereof, as one or other mode of ratification may be proposed by congress : provided, that no amendment, made prior to the year 1808 shall affect the provisions respecting the migration or importation of persons into or from the several states, and the imposition of capitation, or other direct taxes ; and provided, that no state, without its consent, shall be deprived of its equal suffrage in the senate."], [153, "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 137 This last most important provision, which stands the fifth article in the original constitution, is most admirably adapted to secure the liberties of the people to the latest posterity ; without hazarding a dissolution of the confe deracy, or suspending the operations of the existing go vernment. In consequence of this wise and virtuous mea sure, several amendments have been made to the consti tution, among which are the following : That congress shall make no law respecting an establish ment of religion ; or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press, or the right of the people peaceably to assemble and petition government for a redress of grievances. A well-regulated militia being necessary to the secu rity of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed. No soldier shall, in time of peace, be quartered in any house without the consent of the owner ; nor in time of war, but in a manner to be prescribed by law. The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated ; and no warrants shall issue but upon probable cause, supported by oath, or af firmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized. No one shall be held to answer for a capital crime, unless on a presentment, or indictment of a grand jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or mili tia, when in actual service, in time of war or public danger ; nor shall any one be subject, for the same offence, to be twice put up in jeopaidy of life or limb, nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or pro perty, without due nrocess of law ; nor sha'l private pro perty be taken for public use, without just compensation. In all criminal prosecutions,\" the accused shall have a right to a speedy and public trial by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime was committed ; be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation ; be confronted with the witnesses against him, have compul-"], [154, "13S UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. sory process for obtaining witnesses in his favour,and have the assistance of counsel for his defence. In suits at common law, where the value in controver sy exceeds twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved ; and no fact tried by jury shall be other wise re-examined in any court of the United States, than according to the rules of common law. Such are the principal amendments made in the con stitution, in virtue of that essential article, which provides a safe and peaceable remedy for its own defects, as they may from time to time be discovered. A change of go vernment in other countries, is generally attended with convulsions that menace its entire dissolution, and portend scenes of horror and bloodshed, that deter mankind from attempting to correct abuses, or remove oppres sions, until they have become altogether intolerable ; when a national explosion ensues that buries all the orders of the state beneath its ruins. f. During the late war with Great Britain, some ofthe New England states attempted to introduce further alterations into the constitution ; and accordingly met in convention for that purpose. On the 15th of December, 1814, delegates from the states of Massachusetts,Connecticut,andl.hodeIs!and,the counties of Cheshire and Grafton in the state of New Hampshire, in the county of Windham, in the state of Vermont, met at Hartford, in Connecticut, to propose amendments to the constitution. In order to accomplish which, they published a general view of the measures that they deemed necessary to secure the Union against the recurrence of those difficulties and dangers, wliich they thought arose from the radical defect of the consti tution itself, aided by an unwise and impolitic administra tion of the general government. Their resolutions were forwarded by the Hartford convention to the legisla tures ofthe several states in the confederated Union, by a majority of whom they were rejected ; and by those of New York and Virginia received with indignation, and reprobated in the strongest terms of censure. Such was the fate of this peaceable attempt to amend the constitu-"], [155, "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 139 tbn, which in some countries of Europe was magnified into nothing less than an approaching separation between the New England states and the rest ofthe Union. The system of republican government now established in the United States, retains much of the spirit of the English constitution ; and these two essential securities to individu.ls in their persons and their property, the habeas corpus act, and trial by jury, are retained in full energy. It unites the American states in a much closer confederation than ever were the Swiss Cantons or the United Provinces of the Netherlands ; and, indeed, in many important points, it is such a form of government as the world had not before seen. Nevertheless, there are many persons in America, and more in Europe, who are decidedly of opinion that its existence cannot be of long duration ; first, from the weakness of its executive power; and secondly, from the immense extent of terri tory within the limits of the Union. On the contrary, numerous writers, distinguished for political knowledge, contend for its long continuance, from the very nature of its free and popular institutions. The United States have now been happy and free for nearly half a century. Liberty has struck deep root in the country ; it is entwined with the first affections of the heart ; it enters into the earliest combinations of thought ; it is spun into the primitive staple ofthe men tal frame of the Americans ; it is wrought into the very stamina of all their institutions, political and social ; it thoroughly pervades, and perceptibly modifies, even their domestic life ; it is protected by religion and the laws ; it is linked with every habit, opinion, aud interest ; it has, in fine, become the common reason, and the want of all the American people. Propose slavery to such a people; talk to them ol unity in the head ofa government ; mul tiply your sophisms as you please, to prove to them the puternily of arbitrary power ; they will never understand you. We must not suppose that the love of conquest, that fatal passion, will master or lead astray the councils of a nation, which, setting out from a line of nearly 1,500 T"], [156, "140 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. leagues of coast, may spread the noble and hallowed em pire of industry and the arts from the shores ofthe North ern Ocean, to those ofthe great South Sea. History. \u2014 An account ofthe discovery and first settle ment of North America has been already given. In addi tion, the following concise narrative of the revolutionary war, comprising a sketch of those causes which led to the revolution, with a brief history of subsequent events, down to the latest period of which any information has been received, will form a proper introduction to the particular histories of the several states ; which will be found in their respective places. America was very probably peopled soon after the flood ; but who were the first people? and whence did they come ? are questions concerning which much has been said and written. Dr. Robertson and the Abbe Clavigero have attempted a solution of them ; but they are only attempts, and the subject still remains involved in difficulties. One thing is certain, that the original inhabitants were uncivilized, and lived chiefly by hunt ing and fishing. The Europeans, who first visited these shores, treating the natives as wild beasts of the forests, which have no property in the woods where they roam, planted the standard of their respective masters where they first land ed, and in their names claimed the country by right of discovery. Prior to any settlement in North America, numerous titles of this kind were acquired by the English, French, Spanish, and Dutch navigators, who came hither for the purposes of fishing and trading with the natives. Slight as such titles were, they were afterwards the causes of contentions between the European nations. The sub jects of different princes often laid claim to the same tract of country, because both had discovered the same river or promontory ; or because the extent of their respective claims was undetermined. By the treaty of Utrecht in 1713, the English claimed a right of cutting logwood in the bay of Campeachy, in"], [157, "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 141 SouthAmerica. In the exercise of this right, the Eng lish merchants had frequent opportunities of carrying on a contraband trade with the Spanish settlements on th e continent. To remedy this evil, the Spaniards resolved to annihilate a claim, which, though often acknowledged, had never been clearly ascertained. To effect this design, they captured the English vessels, which they found along the Spanish coast, and many of the British subjects were doomed to work in the mines of Potosi. Repeated severities of this kind produced a war between England and Spain, in 1739, which terminated in 1748, by the treaty of peace signed at Aix -la-Chapelle, by which restitution was made, on both sides, of all places taken during the war. Peace, however, was of short duration. The French possessed Canada, and had made considerable settlements at Florida, claiming the country on both sides ofthe Mis sissippi, by right of discovery. To secure and extend their claims, they established a line of forts from Canada to Florida. They had secured the important pass at Nia gara, and erected a fort at the junction of the Allegany and Monongahela rivers, called fort du Quesne, the iden tical spot were the flourishing town of Pittsburgh now stands. They took pains to secure the friendship and assistance ofthe natives ; encroachments were made upon the English possessions, and mutual injuries succeeded. The disputes among the settlers in America, and the measures taken by the French to command all the trade ofthe St. Lawrence river on the north, and ofthe Mis sissippi on the south, excited a jealousy in the English nation, which soon broke out iu open war. This war was carried on with various success. Of four expeditions undertaken in America against the French, only one succeeded ; namely, that under general Monck ton ; who compelled the enemy to abandon Nova Scotia. But one decisive blow, which proved fatal to the interests of France in America, put an end to the war, in 1762. This was the defeat of the French army, and the capture of Quebec, by the brave general Wolfe. That hero was slain at the beginning of the action ; and Montcalm, the"], [158, "142 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. French commander, likewise lost his life. This victory was soon followed by the surrender of Montreal to the British forces, and Canada has remained ever since in possession of England. In 1763, a definite treaty of peace was concluded at Paris between Great Britain, France, and Spain, by which the English ceded to the French several islands which they had taken from them in the West Indies ; but were confirmed in the possession of all North America on this side the river Mississippi, except New Orleans, and a small district of the neighbouring country. It will be proper here to observe, that there were four kinds of government established in the British American colonies : The first was a charter government, by which the powers of legislation were vested in a governor, council, and assembly, chosen by the people ; of this kind were the governments of Connecticut and Rhode Island. The second was a proprietary government, in which the proprietor of the province was governor ; although he generally resided abroad, and administered the govern- ment by a deputy of his own appointment ; the assembly only, being chosen by the people ; such were the govern- ments of Pennsylvania and Maryland, and originally of New Jersey and Carolina. The third kind was that of royal government, where the governor and council were appointed by the crown, and the assembly by the people ; of this kind were the governments of New Hampshire, New York, New Jersey (after the year 1702,) Virginia, the Carolinas, after the resignation of the proprietors in 1728, ancl Georgia. The fourth kind, was that of Massachusetts, which differed from all the rest. The governor was appointed by the king ; so far it was a royal government ; but the members of the council were elected by the representa- tives of the people. The governor, however, had a right to negative a certain number, but not to fill up the vacancies thus occasioned. This variety of governments created different degrees of dependence on the crown. In the royal government, to render a law valid, it was"], [159, "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 143 constitutionally required, that it. should be ratified by the king ; but the charter governments were empowered to enact laws, and no ratification by the king was necessary. It was only required, that such laws should not be con trary to the laws of England. The charter of Connec ticut was express to this purpose. But no sooner was peace concluded than the British parliament adopted the plan of taxing the colonies ; and in justification of the attempt, declared, that the money to be raised, was to be applied towards defraying the expence of defending them in the late war. The first attempt to raise a revenue in America, appeared in the ever-memorable stamp act, passed on the 22d of March, 1765 ; whereby it was enacted, that certain instruments in writing, as bills, bonds, &c. should not be valid in law, unless drawn on stamped paper, on which a duty had been paid. As soon as this act was heard of in America, it raised a general alarm. The people were filled with apprehen sions at an act which they believed to be an infringe ment of their constitutional rights. The news, and the act itself, first arrived at Boston, where the bells were muffled, and rung a funeral peal. The act was first hawked about the streets with death's head affixed to it, and styled \"the folly of England, and the ruin of Ame rica ;\" and afterwards publicly burnt by the enraged populace. The stamps themselves were seized and de stroyed, those who were to receive the stamp duties were compelled to resign their offices ; and such of the Ame ricans as sided with government,had theirhousesplundered and burnt. The colonies also petitioned the king and parliament for a redress of the grievance. Non-importation agreements were every where entered into ; and it was even resolved to prevent the sale of any more British goods after the present year. American manufactures, though dearer, as well as inferior in qua lity to the British, were universally preferred. An asso ciation was entered into against eating of lamb, in order to promote the growth of wool ; and the ladies with cheerfulness agreed to renounce the use of every species"], [160, "14i UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. of ornament manufactured in Britain. Such a general and alarming confederacy, determined the British minis try to repeal some of the most obnoxious statutes ; and accordingly, on the 18th of March, 1766, the stamp-act was repealed, to the universal joy of the Americans, and indeed to the general satisfaction of the English whose manufactures had begun to suffer severely, inconsequence of the American association against them. But now the trade between Great Britain and the colonies was renewed on the most liberal footing. The parliament, however, by repealing this act, so odious to the people of America, by no means intended to relinquish the scheme of raising a revenue in the colo nies, but merely to alter the mode. Accordingly, they passed an act, enjoining the Americans to furnish his majesty's troops with necessaries in their quarters ; as a preliminary measure to other laws of a pecuniary nature. This act the colony of New York had refused to obey ; and another act was now therefore passed, restraining the assembly of that province from making any laws, until they had complied with the terms of the first-mentioned statute. The Americans, on their side, expressed their dissatisfaction at this restraint, by coming to some severe resolutions against the importation of European, by which they, no doubt, meant British manufactures. In I767, the parliament passed an act, imposing a cer tain duty on glass, tea, paper, and painter's colours ; articles which were in great demand, and not made in America. This act, as might reasonably have been ex pected, after what had passed, kindled the resentment of the colonists, and excited a general opposition to the measure. They now came to a direct, as they had for merly done to an indirect, resolution to discontinue the use of British commodities, until these duties should be repealed ; to effect which, the assembly at Boston wrote circular letters to all the other assemblies, proposing a union of councils and measures. For this proceeding the Boston assembly was dissolved, and a new one con vened ; but this soon proved as refractory as the former, and was therefore in a little time likewise dissolved. The"], [161, "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 145 commissioners of the customs were so roughly handled by the populace, that they thought proper to leave the town and retire to fort William, three miles from Bos ton. Indeed, the spirit of discontent had risen to such a height in that town, that two regiments of foot were or dered thither from Halifax, and as many from Ireland. Parliament, however, thought it adviseable, in 1770, to take off the obnoxious taxes, with the exception of three pence a pound on tea. Nevertheless, this duty, however trifling, kept alive the jealousy of the Americans, and their opposition to parliamentary taxation continued to increase daily ; but it will be easily conceived that the duty was not the sole, nor even principal, cause of the op position ; it was the principle, which, once admitted, would have subjected the colonies to unlimited parlia mentary taxation, without the privilege of being repre sented. The right, abstractedly considered, was denied; and the slightest attempt to justify the claim by precedent, was uniformly resisted. The colonies, therefore, entered into measures for encouraging their own manufactures and home produc tions, and for retrenching the use of foreign superflui ties, while the importation of tea was prohibited. In the royal and proprietary governments, and in Massa chusetts, the governors and people were in a state of con tinual welfare. Assemblies were repeatedly called and suddenly dissolved ; employing the time while sitting, in stating grievances and framing remonstrances. As if to inflame these discontents, an act of parliament was passed, ordaining, that the governors and judges should receive their salaries of the crown ; thus rendering them inde pendent on the provincial assemblies, and removeable only at the pleasure of the king. These proceedings, with many others of a similar tendency, could not fail to pro duce a rupture. The first act of violence was the unfortunate transac tion _t Boston, on the evening ofthe 5th of March, 1 770. A body of British troops, as has been already observed, was stationed in Boston, to intimidate the refractory in habitants, and enforce the measures of parliament. On"], [162, "146 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. the fatal day, when blood was to be shed, as a prelude to more tragic scenes, the soldiers, while under arms, were pressed upon, insulted, and pelted by a mob, armed with clubs, sticks, and snow-balls covering stones; they were also dared to fire. In this situation, one of the soldiers, who had received a blow, in resentment fired at the supposed aggressor. This was followed by a single discharge from six others ; so that three ofthe inhabit- ants were killed, and five dangerously wounded. The town was immediately in commotion ; and such was the temper, force, and number, of the inhabitants, that no- thing but an engagement to remove the troops out ofthe town, together with the advice of moderate men, pre- vented the townsmen from falling on the soldiers. The kiiied were buried in one vault, and in a most respectful manner, in order to express the indignation ofthe inha- bitants at the slaughter of their brethren, by soldiers quar- tered among them, in violation of their civil liberties. Captain Preston, who commanded the party which fired on the inhabitants, was committed to jail, and afterwards tried ; but the captain, and six of the men, were ac- quitted, and two only brought in guilty of manslaughter- for it appeared on the trial, that the soldiers were insulted' threatened, and pelted, before they fired ; and it was also proved, that only seven guns were fired by the ei<*ht prisoners ; these circumstances, therefore, induced the jury to make a favourable verdict. In 1773, the spirit ofthe Americans broke out into open violence. The Gaspee, an armed schooner belong ing to his Britannic majesty, had been stationed at Pro vidence, in Rhode Island, to prevent smuggling. The vigilance of the commander irritated the inhabitants to such a degree, that about 200 armed men boarded the vessel under favour of the night, compelled the officers and crew to go ashore, and set fire to the schooner. A reward of offered by government for appre hending any 0f the persons concerned in this during act, producing no effectual discovery. The resolution of the colonies not to import or con sume any tea, having, in a great measure, deprived the"], [163, "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 147 English government of a revenue from this quarter, the parliament formed a scheme of introducing tea into America, under cover of the East India company. For this purpose, an act was passed, empowering the com pany to export all sorts of teas, duty free, to any place whatever. The Americans determined to oppose the revenue system of the English parliament in every possible shape, considered the attempt of the East India company to evade the resolutions of the colonies, and dispose of teas in America, as an indirect mode of taxation, sanctioned by the authority of parliament. The people assembled in various places, and, in the large commercial towns, took measures to prevent the landing of the teas. The same spirit pervaded the people from New Hampshire to Georgia. Tne cargo sent to South Carolina was put in- to warehouses, no person daring to offer it for sale. In Massachusetts, they, in like manner, viewed the tea as the vehicle of an unconstitutional tax, and as inseparably associated with it. To avoid the one, they resolved to destroy the other. About seventeen persons, dressed as Indians, repaired to the the tea ships, broke open 342 chests of tea, and without doing any other damage, dis- charged their contents into the water. No sooner did the tidings of this destruction of the tea reach Great Britain, than the parliament determined to punish that devoted town. A bill was brought in and passed, \" to discontinue the landing and discharging, lading and shipping of goods, wares, and merchandise at the town of Boston, or within the harbour.\" The first of June, the day on wliich the port bill was to take effect, was appointed to be kept as a day of hu- miliation, fasting, and prayer, throughout the colonies ; to seek the divine direction and assistance, in that very critical and gloomy aspect of affairs. But the port bill was not the only act that alarmed the apprehensions of the Americans. Determined to compel the province of Massachusetts to submit to their laws, parliament passed an act \" for the better regulating the government in the NO. vn. u"], [164, "148 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. province of Massachusetts bay.\" The object of this act was, to alter the government as it stood on the charter of king William, and to make the sheriffs and judges dependent on the king, aud removable at his will and pleasure. This act was soon followed by another, which ordained that any person indicted for murder, or other capital offence, committed in aiding the magistrates in executing the laws, might be sent by the governor, either to any other colony, or to Great Britain, for his trial. This was shortly after succeeded by the Quebec bill, which enlarged the bounds of that province, and granted many privileges to the Roman Catholics. The view of this act was, to secure the attachment of that province to the crown of England, and prevent its joining the colo nies in their resistance to the laws of parliament. On the 26th of October, 1774s delegates or commis sioners from all the old British colonies (except Georgia) assembled at Philadelphia ; and their proceedings were cool, deliberate, and loyal : but distinguished by great firmness and unanimity. They enumerated the oppres sive conduct of parliament, and called on the British na tion not to aid the ministry in enslaving their American brethren : in the latter, they endeavoured to confirm the people in a spirited and unanimous determination to de fend their constitutional rights. They also signed an association to suspend the importation of British goods, and the exportation of American produce, until their grievances should be redressed. In addition to these measures, congress exhorted the New Englanders to op pose the execution of the Boston port bill, and of the other severe acts that had been lately passed against them ; and they even promised to assist them in case of necessity. To this, indeed, that people were sufficiently inclined by their own natural disposition- ; as, of all the American colonies, New England was perhaps the pro vince, which, from its independent spirit in religion, had longest cherished the wish, and even entertained th? hopes, of becoming independent in government. The fire, therefore, which had been so long smothei <"], [165, "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 149 ing between Great Britain and her colonies, now broke out into an open flame. General Gage, governor of Massachusetts, having been informed that a large quan tity of ammunition and military stores had been collected at Concord, seventeen miles from Boston, and where the provincial congress was sitting, sent a detachment under the command of colonel Smith and major Pitcairn, to destroy the stores, and, as was reported, to seize Messrs. Hancock and Adams, the leading men of the congress. They set out before day-break, on the 19th of April, marching with the utmost silence, and securing every one they met on the road, that they might not be discovered. But notwithstanding all their care, the con tinual ringing of bells and firing of guns as they went along, soon gave them notice that the country was alarmed. About five in the morning they had reached Lexington, ten miles from Boston, where the militia of the place were exercising. Major Pitcairn, advancing briskly on horseback in front of his men, and within a short distance of the militia, called out \" throw down your arms, ye rebels, and disperse !\" This was presently answered by a volley of musketry from some houses in the neighbourhood ; the military then made a discharge, which killed eight and wounded several of the militia. The detachment proceeded forward to Concord, where, having destroyed the stores, they were encountered by the Americans ; and an action ensued, in which several fell on both sides. The purpose of their expedition being accomplished, it was necessary for the king's troops to retreat, which they did through a continual fire kept upon them from Concord to Lexington, a distance of seven miles. Here their ammunition was expended ; and they would have been unavoidably cut off, had not a considerable reinforcement, commanded by lord Percy, luckily met them. The Americans, however, continued their attack with great fury ; and the British would still have been in the utmost danger, had it not been for two field pieces, which lord Percy brought with him. By these the impetuosity of the Americans was checked, and the British made good their retreat to Boston, with"], [166, "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 150 the loss of 263 killed and wounded ; that of the Ameri cans was eighty-eight. This battle roused all America. The news of the en gagement was no sooner carried into the different parts of the country, than the whole province was at once in arms. The militia assembled from all quarters, and in a few days Boston was besieged by 20,000 men. The coiony of New York, which had hitherto continued to waver, now united with the rest ; and as the situation of the city of New York rendered it unable to sustain an attack from the sea, it was resolved, before the arrival of a British fleet, to secure the military stores, send off the women and children, and set fire to the city, if it was still found incapable of defence. The congress, upon hearing of these transactions, highly approved of all the steps which the New Englanders had taken ; and they passed a resolution, declaring that the inhabitants of Massachusetts owed allegiance no longer to the British crown. They strictly prohibited all the people from sup plying the army, navy, or transport ships, with any kind of provisions ; and the more effectually to mark their contempt for the British government, they erected a post office, at the head of which they placed Dr. Franklin, who had been disgracefully removed from that post in England. And upon General Gage's publishing a pro clamation, offering a pardon to all such as would lay down their arms and return to their duty, but excepting from it Messrs. Hancock and Adams, they immediately chose Mr. Hancock president ofthe congress. As matters had now been carried too far to admit of an immediate reconciliation, it was generally believed that each party would watch an opportunity of striking some blow that might give a decided advantage over the other. Nor was it long before it appeared that this ap prehension was too well founded. Generals Howe, Clinton, and Burgoyne, had previously arrived in Boston, with a number of troops from England. About a mile and a half from Boston, there is an eminence called Bun ker's Hitl, upon a narrow neck of land, or isthmus, near to Charlestown, which is separated from Boston by Charles"], [167, "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 151 river, over which is an elegant bridge 1,500 feet in length. Upon this hill, in one of the short nights of June, the Americans threw up a strong redoubt, considerable in trenchments, and a breast-work almost cannon proof. As this eminence overlooked Boston, general Gage thought it necessary to drive the Americans from it. About noon, therefore, he detached ninjor-general Howe, and briga dier-general Pigot, with the flower of the army, consist ing of four battalions, ten companies of the grenadiers, and ten of light infantry, with a proportion of field artil lery, to effect this business. These troops landed at Moreton's Point, and, June 17, formed after landing, but remained in that position till they were reinforced by a second detachment of light infantry and grenadier com panies, a battalion of land forces, and a battalion of ma rines, making in the whole near 3,000 men. While the troops who first landed were waiting for this reinforcement, the Americans, for their farther security, pulled up some adjoining posts and rail fences, and set them down in two parallel lines at a small distance from each other, and filled the space between with hay, which, having been lately mowed, remained on the adjacent ground. The king's troops formed in two lines, and advanced slowly, to give their artillery time to demolish the Ameri can works. Tbe hills around the adjacent country, which afforded a safe and distinct view, were occupied by the inhabitants of the country. Thousands, both within and without Boston, were anxious spectators of the bloody scene. The British moved on but slowly, which gave the Americans a better opportunity for taking aim. The latter, in general, re served themselves till their adversaries were within ten or twelve rods, but then began a furious discharge of small arms. The stream of the American fire was so incessant, and did so great execution, that at first the king's troops retreated in disorder and precipitation. Their officers rallied them, and pushed them forward with their swords; but they returned to the attack with great reluctance. The Americans again reserved their fire till their adver-"], [168, "152 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. saries were near, and then put them a second time to flight. General Howe and the officers redoubled their exertions, and were at last succesful ; though the soldiers discovered a great aversion to going on. By this time the powder of the Americans began to fail. The British also brought some cannon to bear, which raked the inside of the breastwork from end to end ; the fire from the ships, batteries, and field artillery, was redoubled. The redoubt was attacked on three sides at once. Under these circumstances a retreat from it was ordered, but the Americans delayed, and made resistance with their dis charged muskets as if they had been clubs, so long that the king's troops, who easily mounted the works, had half filled the redoubt before it was given up to them. The engagement was kept up on both sides with great resolution. The persevering exertions of the king's troops could not compel the Americans to retreat, till they observed that their main body had left the hill. This, when begun, exposed them to new danger ; for it could not be effected but by marching over the neck of land adjoining Charlestown, every part of which was raked by the shot of the Glasgow frigate, and two float ing batteries. The number of Americans engaged, amounted to 1,500 men ; out of which they lost 139 killed, and 314 wounded and missing: they also lost five pieces of cannon. But the loss most lamented by them on this occasion, was that of Dr. Warren, then president of the provincial congress of Massachusetts, a major-general in their army, and commander ofthe troops who defended Bunker's Hill. He died, fighting gallantly, at the head of his men, in front ofa redoubt on the right of the line. Almost one half of the British detachment were either killed or wounded ; the loss, according to the returns made by ge neral Gage, amounting to 1,054. The grenadiers and light infantry lost three-fourths of their men : of one company not more than fourteen, and of another only five escaped. The number of officers that fell in this action, compared to that of the private men, was greatly beyond the usual proportion : no less than nineteen"], [169, "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 153 commissioned officers were killed, and seventy wounded. There have been few battles in modern wars, in which, all circumstances considered, there was a greater destruction of men than in this short engagement. That the officers suffered so much, must be imputed to their being particu larly aimed at by the enemy. None of the Americans in this engagement were riflemen, but they were all good marksmen. The whole of their previous military know ledge had been derived from hunting, and the ordinary amusements of sportsmen. The spirit displayed by the people of New England on this occasion, encouraged the congress to proceed with greater alacrity in their military preparations. They had, some time before, issued orders for raising and paying an army ; and they now published a declaration of the mo tives that compelled them to take up arms, and their determined resolution not to lay them down till all their grievances were redressed. But to shew, at the same time, that they had no intention of separating themselves from the mother country, they presented an address to the in habitants of Great Britain, another to the people of Ire land, and a petition to the king, in which they disclaimed all thoughts of an independant government, and declared, that they wished for nothing more ardently than a recon ciliation with the parent state, upon just and reasonable terms. They likewise appointed George Washington, esq. a native of Virginia, to be commander in chief of all the American forces. This gentleman had been a distin guished officer in the British service during the preced ing war. He accepted the appointment with diffidence, which was a proof of his prudence and his greatness of mind. He refused pay for eight years laborious and arduous service ; and, by his matchless skill, fortitude, and preserverance, conducted his country through inde scribable difficulties, to independence, peace, and hap piness. General Washington, with several other officers ap pointed by congress, arrived at Cambridge, near Boston, and took command of the American army in July. From this time the affairs of America began to assunte"], [170, "154 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. the appearance of a regular and general opposition to the power of Great Britain. Jn autumn, a party of New England and New York militia, under the generals Montgomery and Arnold, made an incursion into Canada. They reduced the forts of St. John's and Chamblee, the latter on the 20th of October, and even the town of Montreal. Proceeding to Quebec, they attempted to take that city by storm on the last day of December. The attack was unsuccessful, and fatal to general Mont gomery ; who, with his aid-de-camp, was killed in at tempting to scale the walls. General Arnold was also severely wounded ; and of three divisions which attacked the town, one only entered, and that was obliged to sur render to superior force. After this defeat, the command ofthe troops devolved upon Arnold, who continued some months before Quebec, although his men suffered incre dibly by cold and sickness. But a large body of troops arriving from England in the spring, the Americans were obliged to evacuate the whole province of Ca nada. About this time, the large and flourishing town of Norfolk, in Virginia, was burnt by order of lord Dun more, the then British governor of that province ; and Falmouth, a considerable town in the province of Main, shared the fate of Norfolk, being laid in ashes by order of the English admiral. General Howe, who had suc ceeded general Gage in the command of Boston, though an officer of spirit, and of great military skill, found himself altogether unequal to the difficulties which sur rounded him. The British army was now reduced to a miserable condition. They were effectually cut off from all communication with the American provinces, from which the least supply of provisions was not to be ex pected ; and the store ships from England not only ar rived slowly, but several of them were intercepted by the enemy. In short, the inhabitants of Boston, as well as the army, were in the most imminent danger of perishing by hunger. This accumulated distress was occasioned by the following measures of the British government having come to the knowledge of congress :"], [171, "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 155 Treaties, it seems, had been entered into between the king of England and some German princes, for about 17,000 men, who were to be sent to America the next year, to assist in subduing the colonies. The parliament had also passed an act, forbidding all intercourse with America ; and while they repealed the Boston port and fishery bills, they declared all American property on the high seas forfeited to the captors. This severe act occa sioned congress to change their mode of carrying on the war ; and measures were immediately taken to annoy the enemy in Boston. For this purpose, batteries were opened upon several adjoining hills, from whence they began to play upon the town with incredible fury ; and, now assailed at once by the horrors of war and famine, neither of which it was in their power to repel, they found it indispensably necessary to evacuate the place. Accordingly, the army, and such of the inhabitants as chose to follow its fortunes, being put on board transports, sailed from Boston to Halifax, where they arrived in March, 1776. General Howe had no sooner quitted the town, than general Washington took possession of it; and, with the assistance of foreign engineers, soon fortified it in such a manner as to render it almost impregnable. In the ensuing summer, an expedition was undertaken against Charlestown, the capital of South Carolina. The fleet was commanded by admiral Parker, and the land forces by lord Cornwallis, with generals Clinton and Vaughan. The troops were dis'embarked upon a place called Long island, about seven miles from Charlestown, separated from another, named Sullivan's island, only by a strait, said to be no more than eighteen inches deep at low water. Upon this vague report was the expedition planned ; and the success was such as might have been expected. The British naval force consisted of two fifty gun ships, four frigates, two ships of twenty guns each, an armed schooner, and a bomb vessel. It was deter mined, without hesitation, to attack a strong fort which had been erected on Sullivan's island ; but, though an assault was easy from the sea, it was very difficult to ob- x"], [172, "J 56 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. tain assistance from the land forces. The admiral, how ever, attacked this formidable post with great gallantry, on the 28th of June ; but when thc troops attempted to pass from Long island, in order to second his efforts, they found the strait, instead of eighteen inches, to be no less than seven feet deep. Directly opposite to this strait, the Americans had stationed a strong body of troops, with cannon and intrenchments; while general Lee was posted on the main land, with a bridge of boats betwixt that and Sullivan's island, so that he could at pleasure send rein forcements to the fort. On the morning of that day in which the attack was made, the bomb-ketch began to throw shells into fort Sul livan ; and, about mid-day, the two fifty gun ships and thirty gun frigates came up and began a severe fire. Three other frigates were ordered to take their station betweenCharlestown and the fort, in order to enfilade the batteries, and cut off the communication with the main land ; but, through the ignorance ofthe pilots,they all stuck fast, and, though two of them were disentangled, they were found to be totally unfit for service : the third was burnt, that she might not fall into the hands of the ene my. The attack was therefore confined to the five armed ships and bomb-ketch, between whom and the fort a dread ful fire ensued. The Bristol suffered excessively ; the springs on her cable being shot away, she was entirely exposed to the enemy's fire. As the enemy poured in great quantities of red-hot balls, she was twice in flames. The captain, (Mr. Morns,) after receiving five wounds, was obliged to go below, in order to have his arm ampu tated. After undergoing this operation, he bravely re turned to his place, where he received another wound, but still refused to quit his station ; at last he received a red-hot ball in his belly, which instantly put an end to his life. Of all the officers and seamen who stood on the quarter-deck of this vessel, not one escaped without a wound, excepting sir Peter Parker alone, whose intre pidity and presence of mind on this occasion were very remarkable. The British admiral.after a severe conflict often hours,"], [173, "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 157 and after having lost some of his bravest men and officers, and even a ship of war, which he was obliged to burn, was at last compelled to give up the enterprise, as altoge- ther impracticable. The Americans now began to think that matters had been carried to too great an extremity between them aud the mother country, ever to admit of any sincere or last- ing reconciliation. They therefore, in the month of July, published their famous declaration of independence, which separated the American colonies from Great Britain. This important event took place 284 years after the first discovery of America by Columbus, 166 years from the first effectual settlement in Virginia, and 1 56 years from the first settlement of Plymouth, in Massachusetts ; which were the first English colonies in North America. General Howe did not remain long inactive at Halifax. Shortly after congress had issued the above declaration, he arrived off New York with a powerful force, and landed the troops upon Staton island, nine miles from the city. Being joined by his brother, lord Howe, with a large fleet and considerable reinforcements, he drove the enemy first from Long island, capturing general Sul- livan and lord Sterling with a large body of men, then from New York, which was defended by 1 3,000 militia and regulars under general Washington, and compelled them to abandon Kingsbridge, at the extremity of York island, where they had thrown up some very strong works. He even pursued them to a place called White-plains, where a slight action took place ; but not being able to bring them to a general engagement, he returned to New York, where he fixed his head quarters. In November, fort Washington on York island, was taken, and above 2000 men made prisoners. Fort Lee, on the Jersey shore, opposite to fort Washington, was soon after captured ; but the garrison escaped. About this time, general Clinton with a number of troops took possession of Rhode island ; and, in addition to all these losses and defeats, the American army suffered much by desertion, and more by sickness, which was epidemic, and very mortal."], [174, "158 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. The affairs of congress were now supposed to be in a very desperate situation ; their army might be said to be nearly annihilated. All that remained of 25,000 men, of which it consisted at the commencement of the cam paign, did not now exceed 3000. As the troops had been enlisted only for a certain term, which was expired, they returned, in large bodies, to their families and friends; the few, who from personal regard, attachment tothe cause, or superior bravery,continued with the generals Washing ton and Lee, were too inconsiderable to appear formidable to a powerful and victorious army. To add to the general calamity, general Lee, through an imprudent carelessness, ill-becoming a man in his important station, suffered him self to be captured by a party of British light horse. This unfortunate circumstance gave a severe shock to the remaining hopes of the little army, and rendered their situation truly distressing. While these transactions were taking place in New Jersey, two spirited plans were put in execution by general Washington, which contributed equally to raise the spirits of his own men, and to damp those ofthe British troops. Having collected his scattered forces on the Pennsylva nia side ofthe river Delaware, and called in the assistance of the Pennsylvania militia, on Christmas night, 1776, he silently crossed the Delaware, and at the break of day, attacking a body of Hessians quartered at Trenton, mor tally wounded their commander, captured all their cannon, and made 918 prisoners, which he carried off in triumph. This action, thou seemingly of no very deci sive nature, was sufficient, at that time, to turn the for tune of war in favour of America. Reinforcements came into Washington's army from all quarters ; so that he was soon in a condition to leave his present position, and take his station at Trenton. Emboldened by his late success, he determined to make an attempt on a division of the British forces stationed at Maidenhead, a town situated between Trenton and Prince-town. This con sisted of three regiments, commanded by Colonel Maw hood, an officer of great merit. The troops were sur prised on their march ; but though they were separately"], [175, "159 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. surrounded, and attacked by a force vastly superior, they charged the enemy so resolutely with their bayonets, that they effected a retreat. These enterprises of the American army, however, with the hostile disposition of the people, convinced the British commanders of the impossibility of maintaining posts so far advanced in an enemy's country ; it was there fore resolved to retreat towards Brunswick, thirty-five miles from New York, with the troops and magazines, in order to prevent them from falling into the hands of the Americans. General Washington omitted no oppor tunity of recovering what had been lost ; and by divid ing his army into small parties, which could be reunited on a few hours notice, he in a manner covered the face of the country, and repossessed himself of all the im portant places. Thus ended the campaign of 1776, with scarcely any real advantage gained by the British, except the capture of the city of New York, and a few fortresses in its neighbourhood ; where the troops were obliged to act with as much caution as if they had been besieged by a victo rious army, instead of being themselves the conquerors. In the mean time, congress proceeded with the most in defatigable diligence to recruit their forces, and engaged the soldiers to serve for a term of three years, or during the war. The following year, 1777> was distinguished by very favourable events in favour of America. On the open ing of the campaign, governor Tryon was sent with a body of troops to destroy the stores at Danbury, in Con necticut. This plan was executed, and the greater part of the town burnt. The British suffered considerably in their retreat, having 170 men killed and wounded, and the Americans lost general Wooster, a brave and experienced officer. About this time, the English ge neral, Prescot, with his aid-de-camp, were made prisoners in Rhode island, by the address and enterprise of colonel Barton. In July, general Burgoyne, who commanded the northern British army, took possession of Ticonde roga, on lake Champlain, which had been abandoned by"], [176, "160 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. the Americans. He followed up his successes, crossed lake George, and encamped upou the banks of the river Hudson, near Saratoga. His progress, however, was checked by the defeat of colonel Baum, near Bennington, in which the undisciplined militia of Vermont, under ge neral Stark, displayed astonishing bravery, and captured almost the whole detachment. From all parts of New England the militia now assem bled to stop the progress of general Burgoyne. These, with the regular troops, formed a respectable army, com manded by general Gates. Burgoyne's army laboured under the greatest distresses ; so that in the beginning of October he was obliged to diminish the soldier's allow ance. On the 7th of that month he determined to move towards the enemy. For this purpose he sent a body of 1,500 men to reconnoitre their left wing, intend ing, if possible, to break through it in order to effect a retreat. This detachment had not proceeded far, when a dreadful attack was made upon the left wing of theBritish army, which was with great difficulty preserved by a reinforcement brought up by general Fraser, who was killed in the action. After the troops had with great diffi culty regained their camp, it was furiously assaulted by general Arnold ; who, notwithstanding all opposition, would have forced the entrenchments, had he not received a dangerous wound, which obliged him to retire. Thus the attack failed on the left ; but on the right the camp of the German reserve was forced, colonel Breyman killed, and his countrymen defeated, with the loss cf all their artillery and baggage. This was by far the heaviest loss the British army had sustained since the action at Bunker's hill. The list of killed and wounded amounted to near 1,200, exclusive of the Germans ; but the greatest misfortune was, that the enemy had now an opening on the right and rear of the British forces, so that the army was threatened with en tire destruction. This obliged general Burgoyne once more to shift his position, that the enemy might also be obliged to alter theirs. This was accomplished, on the night of the 7th, without any loss, and all the next day he"], [177, "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. iGl continued to offer the enemy battle ; but they were now too well assured of obtaining a complete victory, by cut ting off all supplies from the British, to risk another en gagement. Wherefore they advanced on the right side, in order to inclose him entirely; which obliged the general to direct a retreat towards Saratoga. But the enemy had stationed a great force on the ford of Hudson's river, so that the only possibility of retreat was,bysecuringapassage to lake George ; and, to effect this, a body of workmen were detached, with a strong guard, to repair the roads and bridges that led to fort Edward. As soon as they were gone, the enemy seemed to menace an attack,which rendered it necessary to recall the guard ; and the work men, being of course left exposed, could not proceed. All this time the American army was increasing by the continual arrival of militia and volunteers from all parts. Their parties extended all along the opposite bank of Hudson's river, and some had even passed it in order to watch the least movement of the British army. The whole force under general Gates was computed at upwards of 18,000 men, while the army under Burgoyne did not amount to 6,000 ; and every part of the camp was pene trated by the grape and riffe shot of the enemy, besides discharges from their artillery, which were almost inces sant. In this state of extreme distress and danger, the army continued with the greatest constancy and perseve rance till the evening ofthe 13th of October, when, an inventory of provisions being taken, it was found that no more remained than what were sufficient to serve for three days ; and, a council of war being called, it was unanimously determined, that there was no method now remaining but to treat with the enemy. In consequence of this, a negociation was opened the next day, which speedily terminated in a capitulation of the whole British army ; the main article of which was, \"that the troops were to have a free passage to Great Britain, on condi tion of not serving against America during the war.\" On this occasion, general Gates ordered his army to keep within their camp, while the British soldiers went to a place appointed for them to lay down their arms, that"], [178, "162 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. the latter might not have the additional mortification of being made spectacles of so melancholy an event. Thirty-five brass field-pieces, 7,000 stand of arms, clothing for an equal number of soldiers, with all the tents, baggage, military chest, &c. likewise fell into the hands of the Americans. This memorable event happened on the 17th of October, 1777 J it diffused universal joy over America, and laid a foundation for the treaty with France. But previous to these transactions, the main body of the British forces had embarked at New York, sailed up the Chesapeak, and landed at the head of Elk river, with the view of attacking Philadelphia. General Washington had determined to oppose them, and for this purposemade a stand, first at Redclay creek, and then upon the heights, near Brandywine creek. Here a desperate and bloody engagement took place on the 11th of September, which lasted nearly the whole day. The Americans were over powered, and suffered great loss ; having no less than 1,000 killed and wounded, besides 400 taken prisoners; and it was only through the approach of night that they were saved from being entirely destroyed. The British soon pursued their march, and took possession of Phila delphia about the end of September. On the 4th of Oc tober, the armies were again engaged at German town, seven miles from Philadelphia- At the beginning of the action the Americans had the advantage, but the fortune of the day turned in favour ofthe British army. General Washington's troops made a very resolute attack, but they were received with such bravery, that they were compel led to abandon the attempt, and retreat in great disorder; with the advantage, however, of carrying off their cannon, though pursued for a considerable way, after having 300 killed, one of whom was geneial Nash, 600 wounded, and upwards of 400 taken prisoners, among whom were fifty four officers. On the British side, the loss amounted to 430 wounded and prisoners, and seventy killed ; among whom were general Agnew and colonel Bird, with some other excellent officers. There still remained the two strong forts of Mud island"], [179, "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. ] 63 and Red Bank, on the Delaware, to be reduced. In the attack upon these, the Hessians were unsuccessful, and their commander, Colonel Donop, mortally wounded. In October, the same month in which General Burgoyne was taken at Saratoga, General Vaughan, with a small fleet, sailed up Hudson's River, and burnt Kingston, a beautiful Dutch settlement, on the west side of the river. The beginning of the next year, 1778, was distin guished by a treaty of alliance between France and America ; by which the Americans obtained a powerful and generous ally. Early in the spring, Count d'Estaign, with a fleet of fifteen sail of the line, was sent by the court of France to assist America. General Howe, having left the army, and returned to England, the command then devolved upon Sir Henry Clinton. In June, the British army left Philadelphia, and marched for New York. On their march they were annoyed by the Americans ; and at Monmouth, sixty four miles from the former city, a very regular action took place between part of the armies ; the British were repulsed with great loss, and, had General Lee obeyed his orders, a signal victory must have been obtained. General Lee, for his ill conduct that day, was suspended, and was never afterwards permitted to join the army. General Lee's conduct, at several times before this, had been very suspicious. In Decembers 1776, he lay at Chatham, about eleven miles from Elizabeth-town, with a brigade of troops, when a great quantity of baggage was stored at Elizabeth-town, under a guard of only 500 Hessians. General Lee was apprized of this, and might have surprised the guard and taken the baggage. But he neglected the opportunity ; and, after several marches and counter-marches between Troy, Chatham, and Morris Town, he took up his quarters at or near White's Tavern, where he was surprised and taken prisoner by a party of the British horse. In August, General Sullivan, with a large body of troops, attempted to take possession of Rhode Island, but Y"], [180, "164 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. did not succeed. Soon after, the stores and shipping afc Bedford, in Massachusetts, were burnt by a party of the British troops. The same year, Savannah, then the capital of Georgia, was taken by the British, under the command of Colonel Campbell. In the following year, 1779, General Lincoln was appointed to the command of the southern army. Governor Tryon, and Sir George Collyer made an incursion into Connecticut, and burnt the towns of Fair field and Norwalk. But the Americans were crowned with success, in a bold attack upon Stoney Point, which was surprised and taken by General Wayne, in the night of the 15th July ; 500 men were made prisoners, with little loss on either side. In October, General Lincoln and Count d'Estaing made an assault upon Savannah, but were repulsed with considerable loss. In this action, the celebrated Polish Count, Pulaski, who had acquired the reputation of a brave soldier, was mortally wounded. In this summer, General Sullivan marched with a body of troops into the Indians' country, and burnt and destroyed all the provisions and settlements that fell in his way. On the opening of the campaign the next year, 1780, the British troops left Rhode Island. An expedition under General Clinton and Lord Cornwallis was under taken against Charleston, South Carolina, where Gene ral Lincoln commanded. This town, after a close siege of about six weeks, was surrendered to the British com mander : and General Lincoln, and the whole American garrison, were made prisoners. General Gates was appointed to the command in the southern department, and another army collected. In August, Lord Cornwallis attacked the American troops at Camden, in South Carolina, and routed them with considerable loss. He afterwards marched through the southern states, and supposed them entirely subdued. The same summer, the British troops made frequent incursions from New York into the Jerseys, ravaging and plundering the country."], [181, "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 165 In June, a large body of the enemy, commanded by the Hessian General, Kniphausen, landed at Elizabeth Town point, and proceeded into the country. They were much harrassed in their progress by Colonel Dayton and the troops under his command. When they arrived at Connecticut farms, according to their usual but sacri legious custom, they burnt the Presbyterian church, parsonage house, and a considerable part of the village. But the most cruel and wanton act that was perpetrated during this incursion, was the murder of Mrs. Caldwell, wife of the Rev. Mr. Caldwell, of Elizabeth Town. This amiable woman, seeing the enemy advancing, retired with her housekeeper, a child of three years old, an infant of eight months, and a little maid, to a room secured on all sides by stone walls, except at a window opposite the enemy. She prudently took this precaution to avoid the danger of transient shot, should the ground be disputed near that place, which happened not to be the case ; neither was there any firing from either party near the house until the fatal moment, when Mrs. Caldwell, unsuspicious of an immediate danger, sitting on the bed with her little child by the hand, and her nurse, with her infant babe by her side, was instantly shot dead by an unfeeling soldier, who had come round to the unguarded part of the house, with an evident design to perpetrate the horrid deed. Many circumstances attend ing this inhuman murder, evince not only that it was committed by the enemy with design, but also that it was by the permission, if not by the command, of Gene ral Kniphausen, in order to intimidate the populace to relinquish their cause. A circumstance which aggravated this piece of cruelty was, that when the officers were made acquainted with the murder, they did not interfere to prevent the corpse from being stripped and burnt, but left it half the day, stripped in part, to be tumbled about by the rude soldiery ; and at last it was removed from the house, before it was burned, by the aid of those who were not of the army. Mrs. Caldwell was an amiable woman, of a sweet and even temper, discreet, prudent, benevolent, soft and engaging in her manners, and belo-"], [182, "166 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. ved by all her acquaintance. She left nine promising children. Mrs. Caldwell's death was soon followed by that of her husband's. In November, 1781, Mr. Caldwell hearing of the arrival of a young lady at Elizabeth Town, whose family in New York had been peculiarly kind to the American prisoners, rode down to escort her up to town. Having received her hito his chair, the centinel observing a little bundle tied in the lady's handkerchief, said it must be seized for the state. Mr. Caldwell instantly left the chair, saying he would deliver it to the commanding officer, who was then present ; and as he stepped forward with this view, another soldier impertinently told him to stop, which he immediately did ; the soldier notwith standing, without further provocation, shot him dead on the spot. Such was the untimely fate of Mr. Caldwell. His public discourses were sensible, animated, and per suasive ; his manner of delivery agreeable and pathetic. He was a very warm patriot, and greatly distinguished himself in supporting the cause of his suffering country. as a husband, he was kind ; as a citizen, given to hospi tality. The villain who murdered him was seized and executed. In July, a French fleet, under Monsieur de Ternay, with a body of land forces, commanded by Count de Rochambeau, arrived at Rhode Island, to the great joy of the Americans. This year was also distinguished by the defection of General Arnold. General Washington having some business to transact at Wethersfield, in Connecticut, left Arnold to command the important post of Westpoint, which guards a pass in Hudson's River, about sixty miles from New \\ork. Arnold's conduct in the city of Phila delphia, the preceding winter, had been censured ; and the treatment he received in consequence, had given him offence. He determined to take revenge ; and for this purpose, entered into a negociation with Sir Henry Clinton, to deliver Westpoint and the army into the hands of the British. While General Washington was absent, he dismounted the cannon in some of the forts,"], [183, "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 167 and took other steps to render the taking of the post easy for the enemy. But by a providential discovery, the whole plan was defeated. Major Andre, aid-de-camp to General Clinton, a brave officer, who had been sent up the river as a spy, to concert thc plan of operations with Arnold, was taken, condemned by a court martial, and executed. Arnold made his escape, by getring on board the Vulture, a British vessel, which lay in the river. His conduct stamped him with infamy ; and, like all traitors, he was despised by all mankind. General Washington arrived in camp just after Arnold had made his escape, and restored order in the garrison. After the defeat of General Gates, in Carolina, Gene ral Greene was appointed to the command in the southern department. From this period, things in that quarter wore a more favourable aspect. Colonel Tarleton, the active commander of the British legion, was defeated by General Morgan, the intrepid leader of the riflemen. General Greene, having effected a junction, about the 10th of March, with a continental regiment, and two large budies of militia, resolved to attack the British troops under Lord Cornwallis. The American army marched from the H igh-rock Ford on the 12th of the month, and on the 14th arrived at Guildford, in North Carolina. Lord Cornwallis, from the inhumation he had received of the motions of the American General, concluded what were his designs. As they approached each other, a few skirmishes ensued between some advanced parties, in which the king's troops had the advantage. On the morning of the 15th, Lord Cornwallis marched at day break to meet the Americans, or to attack them in their camp. About four miles from Guildford, the advanced guard of the British army, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Tarleton, fell in with a corps of the Americans, consisting of Lieutenant Colonel Lee's legion, which he defeated. The greater part of the country in which the action happened is a wilderness, with a few cleared fields inter spersed. The American army, which was superior to the British in point of numbers, was posted on a rising ground. It was drawn up in three lines."], [184, "168 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. About half an hour after one in the afternoon, the action commenced by a cannonade, which lasted about twenty minutes ; when the British troops advanced in three columns and attacked the North Carolina brigade with great vigour, and soon obliged part of these troops who behaved very ill, to quit the field ; but the Virginia militia kept up a heavy fire for a long time, till, being beaten back, the action became general every where. The American corps under Colonels Washington and Lee, did considerable execution. Lieutenant Colonel Tarleton had directions to keep his cavalry compact, and not to charge without positive orders, excepting to pro tect any of the corps from the most evident danger of being defeated. The excessive thickness of the woods rendered the British bayonets of little use, and enabled the broken corps of Americans to make frequent stands with an irregular fire. The second battalion of the guards first gained the clear ground near Guildford court house, and found a corps of continental infantry, superior in number, formed in an open field, on the left of the road. Desi rous of signalizing themselves, they immediately attacked and soon defeated them, taking two six-pounders ; but, as they pursued the Americans into the wood with too much ardour, they were thrown into confusion, and instantly charged and driven back into the fields by Lieutenant Colonel Washington's dragoons, with the loss of the six pounders they had taken. But the American cavalry were in turn repulsed, and the two six-pounders again fell into the hands of the British troops. The spirited exertions of General O'Hara and Lieutenant Colonel Tarleton, contributed to bring the action to a termination. The British troops having at length broken the second Maryland regiment, and turned the left flank ofthe Ame ricans, got into the rear of the Virginia brigade, and ap. peared to be gaining their right, which would have encir cled the whole of the continental troops, when General Greene thought it prudent to retreat. Many of the American militia dispersed in the woods ; but the conti-"], [185, "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 169 nental troops fell back in good order to the Reedy-fork River, and crossed at the ford, about three miles from the field of action. When they had collected their stragglers, they retreated to the iron-works, ten miles distant from Guildford, where they encamped. They lost their artil lery, and two waggons laden with ammunition. It was a hard-fought battle, and lasted an hour and a half. Cf the British troops, the loss, as stated by Lord Corn wallis, was 532 killed, wounded, and missing. General Greene, in his account of the action, transmitted to the congress, stated the loss of the continental troops to be 329 killed, wounded, and missing ; but he made no esti mate of the loss of the militia. Of the British, Lieu tenant Colonel Stuart was killed in the action ; and Lieu tenant Colonel W'ebster, and Captains Schutz, Maynard, and Goodriche, died of their wounds. General O'Hara, General Howard, and Lieutenant Colonel Tarleton were also wounded In the spring, Arnold, the deserter, who was made a brigadier general in the British service, with a small number of troops, sailed for Virginia, and plundered the country. This called the attention of the French fleet to that quarter ; and a naval engagement took place between the English and French fleets, in which some of the English ships were much damaged, and one entirely disabled. After the battle of Guildford, General Greene moved towards South Carolina, to drive the British from their posts in that state. Here Lord Rawdon obtained an advantage over the Americans near Camden. But General Greene more than recovered this disadvantage, by the brilliant and successful action at the Eutaw springs, where General Marian distinguished himself, and the brave Colonel Washington was wounded and taken prisoner. Lord Cornwallis, finding General Greene successful in Carolina, marched to Virginia, collected his forces, and fortified himself in York-town. In the mean time, Arnold made an incursion into Connecticut, burnt a part of New London, took fort Griswold by storm, and put the garrison to the sword. The garrison consisted chiefly of men suddenly collected from the little town of Groton,"], [186, "170 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. which, by the savage cruelty of the officer who comman ded the attack, lost, in one hour, almost all its heads of families. The brave colonel Ledward, who commanded the fort, was slain with his own sword, after he had sur rendered. The marquis de la Fayette, had been despatched with about 2000 light infantry from the main army, to watch the motions of Lord Cornwallis, in Virginia. He prose cuted this expedition with the greatest military ability. Although his force was much inferior to that ofthe ene my, he obliged them to leave Richmond and Williams burgh, and to seek protection under their shipping. On the 30th of August, the French admiral, count de Grasse, with twenty-four ships of the line, anchored in the Chesapeak. Six days afterwards, admiral Greaves, having been joined by sir Samuel Hood, with a squadron from the West Indies, arrived in the same bay with nine teen sail of the line, and an action immediately commen ced. On board the British fleet, ninety were killed and 2*6 wounded ; some of the ships were greatly damaged in the engagement, and the Terrible of 74 guns, was so much shattered, that it was found necessary to burn her. The loss of the French was never known, but it is evi dent they had not suffered equally with their enemy, as they remained masters of the Chesapeak. General Washington had before this time moved the main body of his army, together with the French troops, to the southward ; and as soon as he heard of the arrival of the French fleet in the Chesapeak, he made rapid marches to the head of Elk River, where, embarking the troops, soon arrived at York-town, where Lord Cornwal lis was strongly fortified. In the mean time, it was determined, in a council of war held at New York, that every exertion of both fleet and army should be made to assist Lord Cornwallis, now closely besieged by General Washington. Accordingly, on the 18th of October, sir Henry Clinton himself em barked on board the fleet, and on the 24th, arrived at the entrance ofthe Chesapeak, where they received the mortifying intelligence, that Lord Cornwallis had been obliged to surrender himself and his whole army prison-"], [187, "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 171 ers of war to the combined armies of America and France. By the articles of capitulation it was agreed, that the British troops, amounting to 6000 men, were to be pri soners to the United States, and the seamen to France ; all the British vessels found at York town and Gloucester, were to be delivered up, with a considerable number of cannon, aud a large quantity of military stores. This great event, which took place on the lyth of October, 178 1, decided the contest in favour of America, and laid the foundation of a general peace. Though the capture of Lord Cornwallis did not put an actual, yet it may be said to have put a virtual, end to the war in America. All hopes of conquering it were from that time abandoned, as vain and hopeless ; and every military operation that was afterwards carried on, was not so much with a view of subjugating the colonies, as to maintain the honour of the British arms. In a short time after, all the posts in possession of the British forces in South Carolina and Georgia were abandoned, and they retired to the main army in New York, and the neighbourhood. On the 5th of May, 1782, Sir Guy Carleton arrived at the British head-quarters, to succeed Sir Henry Clinton. Immediately on his arrival, he acquainted General Washington and congress, that negociations for a peace had been commenced at Paris. On the 30th of November, the provisional articles of peace were signed at Paris, by which Great Britain acknowledged the inde pendence and sovereignty of the United States of Ame rica, and these articles were ratified by a definitive treaty. Thus ended a long and arduous conflict, in which Great Britain expended near one hundred millions of money, with one hundred thousand lives, and won nothing. America endured every cruelty and distress from her enemies ; lost many lives and much treasure ; but delivered herself from a foreign dominion, and gained a rank among the nations of the earth. Holland acknowledged the independence ofthe United States on the 19th of April, 1782; Sweden, February 5th, no. viii z"], [188, "172 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 1783; Denmark, the 25th of February; Spain in March ; and Russia in July, 1783. No sooner was peace restored by the definitive treaty, and the British troops withdrawn from the country, than the United States began to experience the defects of their general government. While an enemy was in the country, fear, which had first impelled the colonists to associate in mutual defence, continued to operate as a band of political union. It gave to the resolutions and recommendations of congress the force of laws, and gene rally commanded a ready acquiescence on the part of the state legislatures. Articles of confederation and perpe tual union had been framed in congress, and submitted to the consideration of the states, in the year 1778. Some of the states immediately acceded to them ; but others, which had not unappropriated lands, hesitated to subscribe a compact, which would give an advantage to the states which possessed large tracts of unlocated lands, and were thus capable of a great superiority in wealth and population. All objections however had been over come, and by the accession of Maryland, in March, 1781, the articles of confederation were ratified, as the frame of government for the United States. These articles, however, were framed during the rage of war, when a principle of common safety supplied the place of a coercive power in government, by men who could have had no experience in the art of governing an extensive country, and under circumstances the most critical and embarrassing. Hence, the numerous defects of the confederation. On the conclusion of peace, these defects began to be felt. Each state assumed the right of disputing the pro priety of the resolutions of congress, and the interest of an individual state was placed in opposition to the common interest of the union. In addition to this source of division, a jealousy of the powers of congress began to be excited in the minds ofthe people. This jealousy of the privileges of freemen had been rolsed by the oppressive acts of the British parliament ; and no sooner had the danger from this quarter ceased, than the fears of people"], [189, "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 173 changed their object, and were turned against their own rulers. In this situation, there were not wanting men of indus try and talents, who had been enemies to the revolution, and who embraced the opportunity to multiply the apprehensions of people, and increase the popular discon tents. A remarkable instance of this happened in Con necticut : as soon as the tumults of war had subsided, au attempt was made to convince the people, that the act of congress, passed in 1778, granting to the officers of the army, half pay for life, was highly unjust and tyranni cal ; and that it was but the first step towards the establishment of pensions, and an uncontrolable depotism. The act of congress passed in 1783, commuting half pay for life, for five years full pay, was designed to appease the apprehensions of people, and to convince them that this gratuity was intended merely to indemnify the officers for their losses by the depreciation of the paper currency, and not to establish a precedent for the granting of pen sions. This act, however, did not satisfy the people, who supposed that the officers had been generally indem nified for the loss of their pay, by the grants made them from time to time by the legislatures of the several states. Besides the act, while it gave five years full pay to the officers, allowed but one year's pay to the privates, a dis tinction which had great influence in exciting and conti nuing the popular ferment, and one that turned a large share of the public rage against the officers themselves. The moment an alarm was raised respecting this act of congress, the enemies of American independence became active in blowing up the flame, by spreading reports unfavourable to the general government, and ten ding to create public dissensions. Newspapers, in some parts of the country, were filled with inflammatory publications ; while false reports and groundless insinu ations were industriously circulated to the prejudice of congress and the officers of the late army. Among a people feelingly alive to every thing that could affect the rights for which they had been contending, these reports could not fail of having a powerful effect ; the clam _r"], [190, "174 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. soon became general ; the officers of the army, it was believed, had attempted to raise their fortunes on the distresses of their fellow citizens, and congress become the tyrants of their country. Connecticut was the seat of this uneasiness, although other states were much agitated on the occasion. A remonstrance against the acts in favour of the officers was framed in the house of representatives of that state, and notwithstanding the upper house refused to concur in the measure, it was sent to congress. During the war, vast sums of paper currency had been emitted by congress, and large quantities of specie had been introduced towards the close of the war by the French army, and the Spanish trade. This plenty of money enabled the states to comply with the first requisi tions of congress ; so that during two or three years, the federal treasury was in some measure supplied. But when the danger of war had ceased, and the vast importations of foreign goods had lessened the quantity of circulating specie, the states began to be very remiss in furnishing their proportion of monies. The annihilation of the credit of the paper bills had totally stopped their circu lation, and the specie was leaving the country m cargoes, for remittances to Great Britain. Thus the revenues of congress were annually diminished ; some of the states wholly neglecting to make provision for paying the interest of the national debt ; others making but a partial provision, until the scanty supplies received from a few rich states would hardly satisfy the demands of thecivillist. This weakness of the federal government, in conjunc tion with the flood of certificates or public securities, which congress could neither fund nor pay, occasioned them to depreciate to a very inconsiderable value. The officers and soldiers of the late army were obliged to receive for wages these certificates, or promissory notes, which passed at a fifth, or eighth, or tenth of their nominal value; being thus deprived at once ofthe greatest part of the reward due for their services. Some indeed profited by speculations in these evidences of the public debt ; but such as were under a necessity of parting"], [191, "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 175 with them, were robbed of that^support which they had a right to expect and demand from their countrymen. Pennsylvania, indeed, made provision for paying the interest of her debts, both state and federal ; assuming her supposed proportion of the continental debt, and giving the creditors her own state notes in exchange for those of the United States. The resources of that state are immense, but she has not been able to make punctual payments, even in a depreciated paper currency. Massachusetts, in her zeal to comply fully with the requisitions of congress, and satisfy the demands of her own creditors, laid a heavy tax upon the people. This was the immediate cause of a rebeUion in that state, in 1786. The leaders of the rebels, however, were not men of talents ; they were desperate, but without forti tude ; and while they were supported with a superior force,fcthey appeared to be impressed with that conscious ness of guilt, that awes the most daring wretch, and makes him shrink from his purpose. This appears by the conduct of a large party of the rebels before the magazine at Springfield ; where General Shepherd, with a small guard, was stationed to protect the continental stores. The insurgents appeared upon the plain, with a vast superiority of numbers, but a few shot from the artillery made the multitude retreat in disorder, with the loss of four men. The spirited conduct of General Shepheid, with the industry, perseverance, and prudent firmness of General Lincoln, dispersed the rebels, drove the leaders from the state,and restored tranquillity. An act of indem nity was passed in the legislature for all the insurgents, except a few leaders, on condition they should become peaceable subjects, and take the oath of allegiance. The leaders afterwards petitioned for pardon, which, from motives of policy, was granted by the legislature. But the loss of public credit, popular disturbances, and insurrections, were not the only evils which were generated by the peculiar circumstances of the times. The emissions of bills of credit and tender laws, were added to the black catalogue of political disorders. The expedient of supplying the deficiences of specie, by emissions of paper bills, was adopted very early in the"], [192, "176 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. colonies. The expedient was obvious, and produced good effects. In a new country, where population is rapid, and the value of lands increasing, the farmer finds an advantage in paying legal interest for money ; for, if he can pay the interest by his profits, the increasing value of his lands will, in a few years, discharge the principal. These bills of credit emitted by the state, and loaned to the industrious inhabitants, supplied the want of specie, and enabled the farmer to purchase stock. They were generally a legal tender in all colonial or private contracts, and the sums issued did not generally exceed the quantity requisite for a medium of trade, and retained their full nominal value in the purchase of commodities. But as they were not received by the British merchants in pay ment for their goods, there was a great demand for specie and bills, which occasioned the latter, at various times, to depreciate. Thus was introduced a difference between the English sterling money, and the currencies of the colonies, which remains to this day. The advantages the colonies had derived from bills of credit, under the British government, suggested to con gress, in 1775, the idea of issuing bills for the purpose of carrying on the war. And this was perhaps their only expedient. Money could not be raised by taxation ; it could not be borrowed. The first emissions had no other effect upon the medium of commerce, than to drive the specie from circulation. But when the paper substituted for specie had, by repeated emissions, augmented the sum in circulation, much beyond the usual sum of specie, the bills began to lose their value. The depreciation continued in proportion to the sumsemitted, until seventy, and even one hundred and fifty, nominal paper dollars, were hardly an equivalent for one Spanish milled dollar. Still, from the year 1755 to 1781, this depreciating paper currency was almost the only medium of trade. It supplied the place of specie, and enabled congress to support a numerous army ; until the sum in circulation amounted to 200,000,000 of dollars. But about the year 1780, specie began to be plentiful, being introduced by the French army, a private trade with the Spanish"], [193, "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 177 Islands, and an illicit intercourse with the British garrison at New York. This circumstance accelerated the depre ciation of the paper bills, until their value had sunk almost to nothing. In 1781, the merchants and brokers in the southern states, apprehensive of the approaching fate of the currency, pushed immense quantities of it suddenly into New England ; made vast purchases of goods in Boston ; and instantly the bills vanished from circulation. The whole history of this continental paper, is a history of public and private frauds. Old specie debts were oftfc n paid in a depreciated currency, and even new contracts, for a few weeks or days, were often discharged with a small part of the value received. From this plenty3and fluctuating state ofthe medium, sprung hosts of specula tors and itinerant traders, who left their honest occupa tions for the prospect of immense gains, in a fraudulent business, that depended on no fixed principles, and the profits of which could be reduced to no certaincalculations. To increase these evils, a project was formed to fix the prices of articles, and restrain persons from giving or re ceiving more for any commodity than the price stated by authority. To attempt to fix the value of money, while streams of bills were incessantly flowing from the treasury of the United States, was as ridiculous as an attempt to restrain the rising of water in rivers amidst showers of rain. Notwithstanding all opposition, some states framed, and attempted to enforce, these regulating acts. The effect was, a momentary apparent stand in the price of articles; innumerable acts of collusion and evasion among the dishonest ; numberless injuries done to the honest ; and finally, a total disregard of all such regulations, and the consequential contempt of laws and the authority of the magistrate. During these fluctuations of business, occasioned by the variable value of money, people lost sight in some mea sure, of the steady principles which had before governed their intercourse with each other. Speculations followed and relaxed the rigour of commercial obligations. Indus try likewise had suffered by the flood of money which"], [194, "178 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. had deluged the states. The prices of produce had arisen in proportion to the quantity of money in circulation, and the demand for the commodities of the country. This made the acquisition of money easy, and indolence and luxury, with their train of desolating consequences, spread themselves among all descriptions of people. But as soon as hostilities between Great Britain and America were suspended, the scene was changed. The bills emitted by congress had long before ceased to circu late ; and the specie of the country was soon drained off to pay for foreign goods, the importations of which ex ceeded all calculation. Within two years from the close of the war, a scarcity of money was the general cry. The merchants found it impossible to collect their debts, and make punctual remittances to their creditors in Great Britain ; and the consumers were driven to the neces sity of retrenching their superfluities in living, and of returning so their ancient habit of industry and eco nomy. The change was, however, progressive and slow. In many of the states which suffered by the numerous debts they had contracted, and by the distresses of war, the people called aloud for, emissions of paper bills to supply the deficiency of a medium. But the advantages of spe cie as a medium of commerce, especially as an article of remittance to London, soon made a difference of ten per cent, between the bills of credit and specie. This differ ance may be considered rather as an appreciation of gold and silver, than a depreciation of paper ; but its effects, in a commercial state, must be highly prejudicial. It opens the door to frauds of all kinds : and frauds are usually practised on the honest and unsuspecting, espe cially upon all classes of labourers. The state of Virginia, with more prudence, never sanc tioned the practice of issuing bills ; but allowed the inha bitants to cut dollars, and smaller pieces of silver, in order to prevent it from leaving the state. This practice prevailed also in Georgia.* \u2022 A dollar was usually cut in five pieces, and each passed for a quarter ; so that the person who cut it gained a quarter, or rather a fifth. Therefore, should that silver be re-coined, the state must lose a fifth"], [195, "179 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. Maryland escaped the calamity of a paper currency. A bill for the emission of bills of credit was brought for ward by the house of representatives ; but it was rejected by the good sense of the senate. The opposition of the other house was not only violent, but threatened the most serious consequences to the state ; the question was at length submitted to the people, who decided in favour of the senate. New Jersey, from its situation between the two great commercial cities of Philadelphia and New York, has a continual drain upon its specie. This state also issued a large sum in bills of credit, which served, indeed, to pay the interest of the public debt ; but the currency suffered a vast depreciation as in other states. Rhode island exhibited a sad example of that total want of principle which always succeeds to a neglect of moral duties. Anxious that the state should abound with money, the legislature passed an act for issuing bills to the amount of \u00a3100,000 sterling. This iniquitous law was firmly opposed by many of the most virtuous and respect able characters in the state ; but their opposition only produced more violent measures on the part of the assem bly, who, to the amazement of all honest men, passed another act, enforcing the circulation of these bills, by making them a legal tender in all debts, and obliging every creditor to accept them in payment, or forfeit his demand. But the state was at that time governed by a faction. During the rage among the people for paper money, a number of noisy ignorant men were elected into the legislature from the smaller towns ; and they not only made bad laws to suit their own base purposes, but appointed equally corrupt men to fill the judicial and executive departments. The result of all this was, the total loss of confidence, the state thrown into confusion at home, and held in detestation abroad. Massachusetts had the good fortune, amidst her politi cal calamities, to prevent an emission of bills of credit. New Hampshire made no paper; but in the distresses which followed her loss of business after the war, the legislature made horses, lumber, and most articles of pro duce, a legal tender in the fulfilment of contracts. It is doubtless unjust to oblige a creditor to receive any thing for his debt, which he had not in contemplation at the time of the contract. But, as the commodities which were to be a tender by the law of New Hampshire, were of an intrinsic value, bearing some proportion to the amount of the debt, the injustice of the law was less"], [196, "180 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. flagrant, than that which enforced the tender of paper in Rhode island. Indeed, a similar law prevailed for some time in Massachusetts ; and in Connecticut it is a standing law, that a creditor shall take land on an execution, at a price to be fixed by three indifferent freeholders, provided no other means of payment shall appear to satisfy the demand. In a state that has but little foreign commerce, and little money in circulation, such a law may not only be tolerable, but, if people are satisfied with it, may pro duce good effects. It must not, however, be omitted, that while the most flourishing commercial states introduced a paper medium, to thegreat injury of honest men, a bill for an emission of paper in Connecticut, where there is very little specie, could never command more than one-eighth of the votes of the legislature. The movers of the bill have hardly escaped ridicule ; so generally is the measure reprobated as a source of frauds and public mischief. The legislature of New York, a state that had the least necessity and apology for making paper money, as her commercial advantages always furnish her with specie suf ficient for a medium, issued a large sum in bills of credit, which support their value belter than the currency of any other state. Still the paper has raised the value of specie, which is always in demand for exportation ; and this dif ference of exchange, between paper and specie, exposes commerce to most ofthe inconveniences resulting from a depreciated medium. Such is the history of paper money, thus far a miserable substitute for real coin, in a country where the reins of government are too weak to compel the fulfilment ofpub lic engagements, and where all confidence in public faith is totally destroyed. While the states were thus endeavouring to repair the loss of specie by empty promises, and to support their. business by shadows, rather than by reality, the British ministry formed some commercial regulations that depriv ed them ofthe profits of their trade to the West Indies and to Great Britain. Heavy duties were laid upon such arti cles as were remitted to the London merchants for their goods ; and such were the duties upon American bottoms, that the states were almost wholly deprived of the carry ing trade. A prohibition, as has been mentioned, was laid upon the produce of the United States, shipped to the English West India Islands in American built vessels, and in those manned by American seamen. These restrictions fell heavy upon the eastern states, which depended much"], [197, "181 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. upon ship-building for the support of their trade ; and they materially injured the business ofthe other states. Without a union that was able to form aud execute a general system of commercial regulations, some of the states attempted to impose restraints upon the British trade that should indemnify the merchant for the losses he had suffered, or induce the British ministry to enter into a commercial treaty, and relax the rigonr of their navigation laws. These measures, however, produced nothing but mischief. The states did not act in concert, and the restraints laid on the trade of one state, operated to throw the business into the hands of its neighbour. Massachusetts, in her zeal to counteract the effect of the English navigation laws, laid enormous duties upon Bri- tish goods imported into that state ; but the other states did not adopt a similar measure, and the loss of business soon obliged that state to repeal or suspend the law. Thus, when Pennsylvania laid heavy duties on British goods, Delaware and New Jersey made a number of free ports, to encourage the landing of goods within the limits of those states ; and the duties in Pennsylvania served no purpose but to create smuggling. Thus divided, the states began to feel their weakness. Most of the legislatures had neglected to comply with the requisitions of congress, for furnishing the federal treasury ; the resolves of congress were disregarded ; the proposition for a general impost to be laid and collected by congress, was ne_*atived, first by Rhode island, and -afterwards by New York. The British troops continued to hold possession of the forts on the frontiers of the states, and thus commanded the fur trade. Many of the states individually were in fested with popular commotions, or iniquitous tender laws, while they were oppressed with public debts ; the certifi cates, or public notes, had lost most of their value, and circulated merely as the objects of speculation ; congress lost their respectability, and the United States their credit and importance. In the midst of these calamities, a proposition was made jn 1785, in the house of delegates, Virginia, to appoint commissioners to meet such as might be appointed in the other states, who should form a system of commercial re gulations for the United States, and recommend it to the several legislatures for adoption. Commissioners were ac cordingly appointed, and a request was made to the legis latures of the other states to accede to the proposition, Accordingly, several o _hes,_ ,.s appointed commissioners"], [198, "182 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. who met at Annapolis, in Maryland, in the summer of 1780, to consult what measures should be taken to unite the states in some general and efficient commercial system. But as the states were not all represented, and the powers ofthe commissioners were, in their opinion, too limited to propose a system of regulations adequate to the purposes of government, they agreed to recommend a general con vention to be held at Philadelphia the next year, with powers to frame a general plan of government for the United States. This measure appeared to the commission ers absolutely necessary. The old confederation was essentially defective. It was destitute of almost every principle necessary to give effect to legislation. It was defective in the article of legislating over states, instead of individuals. All history testifies that recommen dations will not operate as laws, and compulsion cannot be exercised over states without violence, war, and an archy. The confederation was also destitute of a sanction to its laws. When resolutions were passed in congress, there was no power to compel obedience by fine, by sus pension of privileges, or other means. It was also desti tute ofa guarantee for the state governments. Had one state been invaded by its neighbour, the union was not con stitutionally bound to assist in repelling the invasion, and supporting the constitution of the invaded state. The con federation was further deficient in the principle of appor tioning the quotas of money to be furnished by each state ; in a want of power to form commercial laws, and to raise troops for the defence and security of the union ; in the equal suffrage of the states, which placed Rhode island on a footing in congress with Viginia; and to crown all the defects, we may add the want of a judiciary power, to define the laws of the union, and to reconcile the contra dictory decisions of a number of independent judicatories. These and many inferior defects were obvious to the com missioners, and therefore they urged a general convention, with powers to form ancl offer to the consideration of the states, a system of general government that should be less exceptionable. Accordingly, in May, 1787, delegates from all the states, except Rhode island, assembled at Philadelphia, and chose general Washington for their president. After four months deliberation, in which the clashing interests of the several states appeared in all their force, the convention agreed to recommend the plan of federal government which has been already recited. As soon as the plan of the federal constitution was sub"], [199, "UNITES STATES OF AMERICA. 183 nutted to the legislatures of the several states, they pro ceeded to take measures for collecting the sense of the people upon the propriety of adopting it. In the small state of Delaware, a convention was called in November, which, after a few days deliberation, ratified the consti tution without a dissenting voice. In the convention of Pennsylvania, held the same month, there was a spirited opposition to the new form of government. The debates were long and interesting. Great ability and firmness was displayed on both sides ; but, on the 13th of December, the constitution was received by two-thirds of the members. The minority were dissatisfied, and, with an obstinacy that ill became the representatives of a free people, published their reasons of dissent, which were calculated to inflame a party already violent, and which, in fact, produced some disturbances in the western parts ofthe state. But the opposition has since gradually subsided. In New Jersey, the convention which met in December, were unanimous in adopting the constitution, as was like wise that of Georgia. In Connecticut there was some opposition ; but the con stitution was, on the 9th of January, 1788, ratified by three-fourths of the votes in convention, and the minority peaceably acquiesced in the decision. In Massachusetts, the opposition was large and respect able. The convention consisting of more than three hundred delegates, were assembled in January, and con tinued their debates with great candour and liberality, about five weeks. At length the question was carried for the constitution by a small majority, and the minority, with that manly condescension which becomes great minds, submitted to the measure, and united to support the government. In New Hampshire, the federal cause was for some time doubtful. The greatest number of the delegates in convention were at first on the side of the opposition ; and some, who might have had their objections removed by the discussion of the subject, instructed to reject the constitution. Although the* instructions of constituents cannot, on the true principles of representation, be bind ing upon a deputy, in any legislative assembly, because his constituents are but a part of the state, and have not heard the arguments and objections ofthe whole, whereas bis act is to affect the whole state, and therefore is to be directed by the sense or wisdom of the whole collected in the legislative assembly ; yet, the delegates in the New"], [200, "184 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. Hampshire convention conceived, very erroneously, that the sense of the freemen in the towns, those little districts where no act of legislation can be performed, imposed a restraint upon their own wills.* An adjournment was therefore moved and carried ; this gave the people an opportunity to gain a farther knowledge of the merits of the constitution, and at the second meeting of the con vention it was ratified by a respectable majority. In Maryland, several men of abilities appeared in the opposition, and were unremitted in their endeavours to persuade the people, that the proposed plan of govern ment was artfully calculated to deprive them of their dearest rights ; yet, in convention it appeared that five sixths of the voices were in favour of it. In South Carolina, the opposition was respectable ; but two-thirds of the convention appeared to advocate and vote for the constitution. In Virginia, many of the principal characters opposed the ratification of the constitution with great ability and industry But, after a full discussion of the subject, a small majority of a numerous convention, appeared for iis adoption. In New York, two-thirds of the delegates in conven tion were, at their first meeting, determined to reject the constitution. Here, therefore, the debates were the most interesting, and the event extremely doubtful. The argument was managed with uncommon address and ability on both sides of the question. But, during the session, the ninth and tenth states had acceded to the proposed plan ; so that, by the constitution, congress were empowered to issue an ordinance for organizing the new government. This event placed the opposition on new ground, and the expediency of uniting with the other states \u2014 the generous motives of conciliating all differences, and the danger of a rejection, influenced a respectable number, who were originally opposed to the constitution, to join the federal interest. The constitu tion was accordingly ratified by a small majority ; but the ratification was accompanied here, as in Virginia, with a bill of rights, declaratory of the sense of the convention, as to certain great principles, and with a catalogue of amendments, which were to be recommended to the con sideration of the new congress, and the several state legislatures. North Carolina met in convention in July, to deliberate on the new constitution ; after a short session they rejected * Tliis peroicious opinion has prevailed in all the states, and done infinite mischief."], [201, "185 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. it, by a majority of one hundred and seventy-six against seventy-six. This was the first state that, in a formal manner, rejected the constitution. Rhode island was doomed to be the sport of a blind and singular policy. The legislature, in consistency with the measures which had been before pursued, did not call a convention, to collect the sense of the state upon the pro posed constitution ; but in an unconstitutional and absurd manner, submitted the plan of government to the consider ation of the people. Accordingly, it was brought before town-meetings, and iq most of them rejected. In some of the large towns, particularly in Newport and Provi dence, the people collected and resolved, with great pro priety, that they could not take up the subject ; and that the proposition for embracing or rejecting the federal constitution, could come before no tribunal but that of the state in convention or legislature. Both the last-mentioned states have since adopted the federal constitution by very respectable majorities. From the moment the proceedings of the general con vention of Philadelphia transpired, the public mind was exceedingly agitated, and suspended between hope and fear, until nine states had ratified their plan of a federal government. Indeed, the anxiety continued until Virginia and New York had acceded to the system. But this did not prevent the demonstrations of their joy, on the acces sion of each state. On the ratification in Massachusetts, the citizens of Boston, in the elevation of their joy, formed a procession in honour ofthe happy event, which was novel, splendid, and magnificent. This example was afterwards followed, and in some instances improved upon, in Baltimore, Charleston, Philadelphia, New Haven, Portsmouth, and New York, successively. Nothing could equal the beauty and grandeur of these exhibitions ; a ship was mounted upon wheels, and drawn through the streets ; mechanics erected stages, and exhibited specimens o\u00a3 labour in their several occupations, as they moved along the road ; flags with emblems descriptive of all the arts, and of the federal union, were invented and displayed in honour of the government ; multitudes of all ranks in life assembled to view the majestic scenes ; while sobriety, joy, and harmony marked the brilliant exhibitions, by which the Americans celebrated the establishment of their empire. After the adoption of the new constitution, and the public celebration of that great event, which, in America is dignified with the title of a second revolution ; on the"], [202, "186 UNITED STATE* OF AMERICA. 11th of March, 1789, delegates from the eleven states, which had then rendered the constitution effectual by their acceptance and ratification of it, met at New York, in the Federal-hall, a new and elegant building, prepared for their reception. Though great difference of opinion had lately existed relative to the new form of government, there was but one sentiment as to the individual who should be elected its supreme magistrate. All men, of whatever party, fLxed their attention upon the late commander of their armies, as the fittest person to fill the important station of president. Upon opening and counting the votes, it was found that George Washington was unani- mously elected president, and John Adams vice-president, by a great majority. The intelligence of his election having been commu- nicated to general Washington, while on his farm, in Virginia, to which he had retired, unambitious of farther honours, he set out soon after for New York. On his way thither, the road was crowded with countless num bers, anxious to enjoy a sight of the \" man of the people.\" Large escorts of militia, and many gentlemen of the first character and station, attended him from town to town, and he was every where received with the highest honours which a grateful and admiring people could con- fer. Addresses of congratulation were presented to him by the iuabitants of every place of consequence through which he passed ; to all of which he returned such modest, unassuming answers, as were in every respect suited to his situation. So great were the honours with which he was loaded, that they could scarcely have failed to produce haughtiness in the mind of any ordinary man; but nothing ofthe kind was ever discovered in this extra ordinary personage. On all occasions, he behaved to all men with the affability of one citizen to another. He was truly great in deserving the applause of his country, but much greater in not being elated by it. When he arrived at the river Schuylkill, the bridge over which he had to pass was highly decorated with laurels and evergreens. At each end of it were erected magnificent arches composed of laurels, and on each side of the bridge was a laurel shrubbery. As he passed the bridge, a youth ornamented with spri_s of laurel, assisted by machinery, let drop above his head (unp. rceived by him) a civic crown of laurel. Upwards of 20,000 citi- zens lined the sences, fields, and avenues, between the Schuylkill and Philadelphia. Through these he was con- ducted to the city, by a very numerous aud respectable"], [203, "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 187 body ofthe citizens, where he partook of asumptuous enter tainment provided for the occasion. The pleasures of the day were succeeded by an elegant display of fire-works. On crossing the river Delaware, and landing on the Jersey shore, he was saluted with repeated cheering by the inhabitants of the vicinity ; and when he came to the brow ofthe hill, on his way to Trenton, a triumphal arch was erected on the bridge, by the direction of the ladies of the place. The crown of the arch was highly ornamented with imperial laurels and flowers, and on it was displayed, in large characters, \" December 26, 1776 ;\" in allusion to general Washington's victory over the Hessians on that day, in the neighbourhood of Trenton. On the sweep of the arch beneath was this inscription, \" The defender of the mothers will also protect their daughters.\" On the north-side were ranged a number of young girls dressed in white, with garlands of flowers on their heads, and bas kets of flowers on their arms ; in the second row stood the young ladies, and behind them the married ladies of the town. The instant he passed the arch, the young girl* began to sing the following ode : Welcome, mighty chief, once more, Welcome to this grateful shore : Now no mercenary foe Aims again the fatal blow \u2014 Aims at thee the fatal blow. Virgins fair, and matrons grave, These, thy conqu'ring arm did sawe, Build for thee triumphal bow'rs ; Strew, ye fair, his way with flow'rs \u2014 Strew your hero's way with flow'rs.\" As they sung the last lines, they strewed the flowers on the road before their beloved deliverer. His situation on this occasion, contrasted with what he had in December , 1776, felt on the same spot, when the affairs of America were at the lowest ebb of depression, filled him with sen- sations that cannot be described. He was rowed across the bay from Elizabeth -town to New York in an elegant barge by thirteen pilots, while all the vessels in the har- bour hoisted their flags. Stairs had been erected and de- corated for his reception, and upon his landing, universal joy diffused itself through every order of the people ; and he was received and congratulated by the governor of the utate, and tbe officers of the corporation. He was con- _B"], [204, "188 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. ducted from the landing-place to the house which had been fitted up for his reception, and was followed by a procession of militia in elegant uniforms, and by great numbers of citizens. In the evening the houses of the in habitants were brilliantly illuminated, and fire-works dis played in many places. Soon after his arrival, a day was appointed for his taking the oath of office ; and on this occasion he was wholly clothed in American manufactures. In the morning of the day fixed for this purpose, the clergy of different de nominations assembled their congregations in their respep tive places of worship, and offered up public prayers for the president and people of the United States. About noon a procession, followed by a multitude of citizens, moved from the president's house to the federal hall. When they came within a short distance of the hall, the troops formed a line on both sides of the way, through which ge neral Washington, accompanied by the vice-president, Mr. Adams, passed into the senate chamber. Immediately after, accompanied by both houses of congress, he went into the gallery fronting Broad-street, and before them, and an immense concourse of people, took the oath pre scribed by the constitution, which was administered by Mr. Livingston, chancellor of the state of New York, and was in the following words : \" I do solemnly swear, that I will faithfully execute the office of president of the United States, and will to the best of my abilities, preserve, protect, and defend the constitution of the United States.\" An awful silence prevailed among the spectators during this part of the ceremony : it was a minute of the most sublime political joy. The chancellor then proclaimed him president ofthe United States, which was followed by a salute from thirteen pieces of cannon, and by the voices ofthe surrounding spectators, who rent the air with their acclamations. The president bowed most respectfully to the people, and the air atrain resounded with shouts of exultation. He then retired to the senate chamber, where he made an animated speech to both houses ; in which his language not only expressed his own feeli__son this solemn occasion, but likewise discovered his anxiety and concern for the welfare and happiness of the people in whose cause he had so often ventured his life. Several circumstances concurred to render the scene of his inauguration unusually solemn and impressive: the presence of the beloved father and deliverer of his coun-"], [205, "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 188 try ; the impressions of gratitude for his past services ; the vast concourse of spectators ; the devout fervency with which he repeated the oath, and the reverential manner in which he bowed to kiss the sacred volume \u2014 these circum stances, together sviili that of his being chosen to the most dignified office in his country, and perhaps in the world, by the unanimous voice of more than 3,000,000 of enlight ened freemen, all conspired to place this among the most august and interesting scenes which have ever been exhi bited on the face of the globe.* The measures of the first congress, after the adoption of th_ federal constitution, was marked with wisdom, and produc tive of great national prosperity. Among other important objects, the wise appointments of proper persons to fill the different offices of government ; the establishment of a reve nue, ajudiciarysystem, and a national bank ; the assump tion ofthe debts of the individual states, (see page 119,) and the encouragement given to manufactures, commerce, literature, and useful inventions, opened the fairest pros pect for peace, union, and happiness to the United States. But besides these objects of great national interest, the at tention ofthe legislature was likewise engaged with as sociating into the general union, the new states of Ver mont and Kentucky, and establishing temporary govern ments in the territories south and north-west of the river Ohio; the planning and building ofa new metropolis, upon a grand scale, to be the seat of government, named after their heroic general and first president, Washington; the taking a general census of the population of the United States ; the negociating a loan with Holland ; the regula tion of their militia; the making of new roads and bridges; the establishing of regular post-offices,, of a mint, &c. and what may appear more surprising, the institution of an excise ! But while these important matters occupied the congress, the peace and prosperity of the country were considerably interrupted by an Indian war, which began in 1790, and was carried on with various success on the part of the United States, and with the usual barbarities on that ofthe \u2666 \" It seemed from the number of witnesses,\" said an intelligent spectator of this sublime scene, \" to be a solemn appeal to heaven and earth at once. Upon the snbject of this great and good man, I may, perhaps, be an enthusiast; but I con fess, I was under an awful and religious persuasion, that the gracious Ruler of tha universe was looking down at that moment with peculiar complacency on an act, which, to a part of his creatures, was so highly important. Under Ibis impression, when ihe chancellor pronounced, in a very feeling manner, ' Long lite Georg* Washington,' my sensibility was wound up to such a pilch, thai 1 could do no more than wave my hat with tlie rest, wiiiieu. the power of jiuning in the repeated. acclamations which rent the air.\""], [206, "190 UNITED STATES OF A.MERICA. Indians. The origin of it is said to have been occasioned by some of the Indian tribes laying claim to part of the ground occupied by the new settlers on the banks of the Ohio. Owing to the wandering habits of the Indians, it is often a very precarious tenure to purchase land from any one tribe, while others, who may have formerly occupied it, remain unsatisfied ; as, unless they also are recompensed, they are apt to return and dispossess the new inhabitants ; who, on the other hand, are but too ready to adopt violent, instead of pacific measures. From such causes originated a war, wherein the Indians had evidently more than usual conduct, both by combin ing in more numerous bodies, and by displaying more mili tary skill than formerly ; not only defeating a detachment of 1,400 men, under general Sinclair, but on different oc casions, successfully contending with equal numbers under other American generals. They even captured fort Jeffer son, in the present state of Ohio, fort Franklin, in Penn sylvania, and other places belonging to the United States. It is much to be regretted, that in a country, the far greater part of which is uninhabited, any misunderstanding should occur to excite the new and old inhabitants to slaughter each other. The American government, however, was prudent enough to observe a strict neutrality with regard to European politics, which at that period began to con vulse the whole world. In the year 1791, the French revolution had been some time commenced. From the beginning of that revolution, many of the leading men in America, and amongst them the president, had no confidence in its beneficial conse quences. But it was necessary for congress to preserve a good understanding with France, under whatever rulers, so long as she abstained from committing any acts of hos tility against the United States. In the beginning of 1792, when the people of every country were divided into con tending parties, much animosity prevailed in America upon the subject of French politics; and while a number of men in the higher ranks of society, and several holding official situations, supported the cause of Great Britain, the great mass of the American people were decidedly in favour of France. During this period, general Washington was a second time chosen president of the United States, but by no means unanimously, as he had been the first time. The disposition which he had evinced to take no part in support of the French revolutionists, had been the means of creating him many enemies ; particularly among those who considered all mankind as deeply interested in"], [207, "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 191 the success of that great contest. He had, however, a considerable majority ; and Mr. Adams was again elected vice-president. At this time, and for some years afterwards, the danger of America was truly great, and required the utmost pru dence and vigilance on the part of her governors. But happily for the people of that country, they had appoint ed men for their rulers who possessed not only the virtue, but the wisdom to avoid intermeddling with the madden ing politics of Europe. The great talents, and consum mate prudence of the president were never more conspi cuous than at this trying period. The spirit of revolution then agitated all the nations of Europe ; but in other countries it had to contend with long-established power and ancient prejudices. It had to eradicate habits of at tachment, in some nations, for their government ; of fear in others; and of submission in all; but in America the government was modern, and its power feeble. In addi tion to the difficulties of congress, arising from the above mentioned state of public affairs, they had to encounter and suppress an insurrection in the western counties of Pennsylvania. The character and office of the president had been reviled, his authority insulted, and even his life threatened. Yet neither resentment, nor fear, nor even policyT, could extinguish the humanity of that great man ; and the revolt was speedily quelled with less blood shed than often occurs in dispersing a common mob in Europe. Throughout the whole of Washington's administration, the interests of the British nation had an evident prepon derance in the American councils, over those of France. So early as August, 1793, the French ambassador, citizen Genet, had used every exertion to prevail on congress to take an active part with the republicans of France ; but all attempts for that purpose were uniformly and wisely resisted on the part of the president. Indeed, if the government of the United States had been desirous ofa rupture with Great Britain, they could not have wanted for sufficient pretexts. The general orders given to the British ships of war and privateers to seize all vessels laden with provisions or warlike stores for France, and the consequent capture of a great number of American vessels, gave great umbrage to the United States ; besides which, they complained that their seamen were impressed by British cruisers, and that several articles in the treaty of peace, of 1783, had never been properly fulfilled. Among others, that some forts which ought, by that treaty,"], [208, "192 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. to have been surrendered to America, were still held in possession by the English forces. On these accounts, there was every appearance of a rupture between Britain and the United States in the summer of 1794; but the latter having, on the 16th of April, sent over Mr. Jay, chief justice of the republic, as ambassador extraordi nary upon this important business, after several con ferences with lord Grenville, and other members of ths British cabinet, a treaty was, happily for both countries, concluded on the 19th of November, whereby all differ ences were adjusted ; and the amity of Great Britain and the States for that time established. By this treaty it was agreed, \" that the British troops should be entirely withdrawn from all the posts still occupied by them, within the boundaries of the United States ; that the subjects of Great Britain and the citizens of the United States should be mutually allowed a free passage through the territories of each other, for the pur poses of trade; that the American courts of law should be open for the recovery of British debts ; that America should be indemnified for all captures made by Great Britain during the war ; that the uatives of each country should be capable of enjoying and conveying lands in the dominions of the other ; that the Americans should be at liberty to carry to the West Indies, the produce of their country in vessels of seventy tons or under ; that the ships of the United States should have free admission into the ports possessed by the British in the East Indies ; and that persons flying for murder or forgery, should, upon requisition, be delivered up on both sides.\" By these stipulations, and a few others of less importance, all grounds of difference were removed ; and to this treaty were the United States indebted for a continual stream of wealth and prosperity, unexampled in the history of nations. On the 31st of January, 1795, colonel Hamilton, secre tary of the treasury, resigned his situation, and was suc ceeded in office by Mr. Wolcott. ln a short time afterwards, general Knox, secretary at war, resigned also, and was succeeded by colonel Pickering. By the resigna tion of colonel Hamilton, the American government lost a man of the most distinguished talents, and the pre sident an able assistant, by whose counsel he was enabled to overcome the difficulties of that very critical period. This accomplished gentleman was afterwards killed in a duel by the celebrated colonel Burr. Jn the beginning of June, the treaty between Great"], [209, "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 193 Britain and the United States was laid before the senat. for their approbation ; when, after much deliberation, two-thirds of the house, the constitutional majority, advised the president to ratify it, with some amendment of the 12th article. At this time, the party in opposition to the president used every exertion to keep alive the spirit of hostility against Britain. Mr. Jay's negociation had been conducted with considerable secrecy, and this was dwelt upon by the disaffected as contrary to the principles of a republican government. To add to the discontent, information was received through a credible channel, that the British court had renewed the orders to their ships of war to detain all vessels loaded with pro- visions bound to France. This determined the president, who had previously resolved to ratify the treaty, to issue a strong remonstrance against those orders ; and soon after he was called to his seat in Virginia. During his absence, and while the public mind was in a state of irritation, an incorrect copy ofthe treaty appeared In a democratic journal, to which it had been sent by a turbulent senator. Nothing was now to be heard, through- out the Union, but violent declamation against the mea sures of government, and particularly against the treaty with England. Public meetings were holden in all the large towns, and intemperate addresses voted, which were published in the newspapers before they were presented to the president. Pamphlets were also put into circulation, written with much ingenuity, and calculated to increase the prejudices against this national transaction ; on the pretence that it was a sacrifice of the interests of France in favour of Great Britain. The president was deeply affected by these violent pro ceedings, but they did not change his resolution. His general conduct, and his letters, at this period, sufficiently prove the firmness and fortitude with which he was deter mined to resist every attempt that might be made to over awe the executive power. But the evil he had chiefly to apprehend was, that France might take advantage of these commotions, either to compel the government of the United States to embrace her measures, or to embarrass the execution of the treaty with Great Britain. In a letter which he wrote to the secretary of state, on the 29th of July, he represented the state of the country as requiring the utmost vigilance and circumspection, and observed, that notwithstanding the support which government had reason to expect from Hew York, unless Boston and other places afforded equal assistance, there would be every"], [210, "194 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. reason to believe that the opposition was universal, which would make the ratification of the treaty a very serious business indeed. On the 11th of August, the president arrived at Phila- delphia, and on the next day the cabinet ministers were assembled, to discuss the question respecting the ratifica- tion of the treaty. The secretary of state advised the post- ponement of the measure, until the orders of the British government were revoked. The other members voted for an immediate ratification, with a strong remonstrance against those orders. To this last advice the president agreed : the British orders were recalled, and the ratifica- tions of the treaty exchanged. Violent opposition now ceased, and experience convinced discerning men, that the treaty was both wise and salutary. On the 19th of August, 1795, Mr. Randolph resigned his office as secretary of state. He had been strongly sus- pected of breach of trust, and of having committed the honour and interest of his country, in his \"communications with the French ambassador. He was succeeded by colonel Pickering:, the secretary at war ; which office was filled by Mr. M'Heury. By the death of Mr. Bradford, the office of attorney-general became vacant, which was conferred on Mr. Lee, of Virginia. In the autumn of that year, a treaty was negotiated, through the agency of colonel Humphreys, with the regency of Algiers, bv whic_ a number of American citizens, who had been enslaved, were liberated. On opening the first session of the fourth congress, at the end of this year, it was found that a majo- rity of the house of representatives was opposed to the general administration of the government : to this party the British treaty was very offensive. The conduct ofthe senate towards the president and the ministry Was, on th_ contrary, cordial aud respectful. Colonel Monroe, having been appointed ambassador to t ranee, reached Paris soon aster the fall of Robespierre : his reception as the American minister was public, and on this occasion, he gave the convention the most positive assurances ofthe fervent attachment ofthe American peo- ple to the interests of the French nation. The committee of public safety in France had previously written to con- gress, and the chief magistrate of the United States being the constitutional organ of foreign intercourse, both houses had transmitted this letter to the president, with a request, tnat he would, in a respectful answer, express their friendly disposition towards the French republic. Accordingly, the secretary of state addressed two letters to the commit-"], [211, "UNITED STATES OF AMERIC... 1 9. tee of public safety, in the name of each branch of the legislature. These colonel Monroe conveyed, and de livered, with his own credentials, to the president of the convention. The communications ofthe American minister were re- ceived with expressions of high gratification, and the con- vention decreed, that the flags of France and Amerlpa should be united, and suspended in their hall, as ah em- blem of the eternal union and friendship of the two re- fmblics. Colonel Monroe, to interchange this act Of fra- erriity, requested the convention to accept from him the American flag, as evidence of his own sensibility, and as a token of the satisfaction with which his country would imT jrove every opportunity to promote the union of the two nations. M. Adet, ambassador from France, had arrived in Philadelphia in the summer of this year, and brought with him the French flag, as a compliment from Ine cph- vefitiori to congress, and a letter from the committee of public safety to that body. He made no mention to the president of this present until December, intending to present it directly to congress, and to avail himself of tbe opportunity to address the representatives of the people. The president and ministry, perceiving his intention.,, to' lhake a bridge of the executive power in order to open a direct communication with tbe popular branch of con- gress, and apprehending evils from it, with great address defeated the intriguing scheme. They directed, that the nag ah'_ the letter should be placed in the hands ot the president, and by him presented to congress. The Ist of Jahuary, 1796, was the day appointed on which the president would receive them. 0n .bis occa- sion, the French ambassador addressed him in the impas- sioned language of his countrymen ; and concluded an animated speech by declaring, that France was exerting herself in defence ofthe liberties of mankind. To answer this speech was a delicate task. Warija expressions of friendship for the French nation were expected by the ambassador; and it was imprudent for the chief of a neutral iianon to shew partiality or prejudice towards belligerent powers'. Under these circumstances, the president re turned a very prudent and guarded, yet dignified answer. After paying some handsome compliments to the people of France, and professing his warm attachment to the cause of liberty, he concludes by saying, \" I receive, sir, with lively sensibility, the symbol of the triumphs, and o. the rej leasemeht of your nation, the colours of France, which1 /ou have now presented to the United States! The trans- NO. IX. 2 c"], [212, "196 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. action will be announced to congress, and the colours will be deposited with the archives of the Union, which are at once the evidence and the memorials of their free dom and independence : may these be perpetual, and may the friendship ofthe two republics be commensurate with their existence.\" The address of the French minister, the reply of the president, the flag of France, and the letters of the committee of public safety, were all transmitted by the president to congress. In February, 1796, the treaty was returned in the form recommended by the senate, ratified by his Britannic ma jesty ; and on the last of that month, the president issued his proclamation, declaring it to be the law of the land. But the ruling party in the house of representatives dis puted the power ofthe president and senate to conclude a treaty without the concurrence of their house. Accord ingly, in March, they passed a resolution, requesting the president to lay before them a copy of Mr. Jay's instruc tions, with all other documents relative to said treaty. This resolve placed the president in a situation of high responsibility. He knew the danger of opposing the popu lar branch of the legislature, in a government constituted like that of the United States ; but he also knew that to grant their request would establish a false and dangerous principle in the diplomatic transactions of the nation. Therefore, upon mature deliberation, he refused to com ply with tbe request of the house of representatives. This refusal occasioned violent debates in the house, which were continued from time to time, until the people assumed the subject, and by numerous meetings in different places, fully proved that a very great majority was disposed to sup port the executive power. The numerous friends which France had acquired in the United States, induced the French government to form a plan for obtaining an influence in the administration of American affairs. M. Fouchet, the former ambassador from France, had made several complaints against the measures of president Washington ; and at the close of his ministry, he even descended to reproach. His successor, M. Adet, on his arrival in Philadelphia, had full informa tion given him on the subject of the British treaty. The American ambassador at Paris, colonel Monroe, had been instructed to lay before the directory certain documents of his government, with a view of removing any uneasiness from the minds of the French rulers ; but it appears he had not exactly followed his instructions, having reserved those papers as answers to any complaints that might be"], [213, "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 197 made by the government of France against the frealy with Great Britain. The president, not being perfectly satisfied with colonel Monroes conduct, recalled him, and appointed as his successor general Pinckney. The time was now approaching, when the second pre sidency of general Washington would expire ; but nothing was more certain than his re-election, had he thought proper fo offer himself as a candidate. However, in the month of October, he publicly announced his resolution of retiring from public life, and strictly enjoined his friends not to nominate him on the ensuing election. The resignation of this distinguished character, at a period so very critical, was lamented by all moderate men in the United States, and no less deplored by the friends of government in Great Britain. By the latter he was eon~ . .dered as a steady friend, and was indeed regarded as the leader of what was called the English party in America ; for whatever may have been asserted to the contrary by some mischievous politicians in this country, British influ ence has always predominated in the United States over that of every other European country, and must ever have the asceadancy while the causes, stated in page 75, continue to exist. In viewing the public life of general Washington, the powerful influence of political connexion is very remark able.\u2014In 1776, he was considered by most of the good people of England as a proscribed rebel, deserving of an ignominious death : twenty years afterwards, he was ex tolled by many of the same people as England's best friend in the United States. \u2014 In 1776, it was believed in this country that nothing could preserve the American colonies to Great Britain but his destruction : in 1796* bis friendship was considered as one of the most powerful preventatives against England falling under the dominion of France. At the former period, Washington looked to the assistance of France as the best means of protect ing the liberties of America against the encroachments of the British ministry : at the latter, he must have sup posed Great. Britain as the best security for the safety of the United States against France. The election of a first successor to that great man who had filled the president's chair for two successive terms, was the most important event in the history of the infant republic. The choice fell upon John Adams as president, and Thomas Jefferson as vice-president. The functions of the new chief magistrate were not to commence till the 4th of March, 1797, on which day be repaired to the"], [214, "198 WNITED STATES OF AMERICA. house of representatives tp take the necessary oaths. General Washington attended the inauguration of his successor in office. Great sensibility was manifested by the members of the legislature, and other distinguished characters, when he entered the senate chamber, and much admiration expressed at the complacence and delight he manifested at seeing another clothed with the authority with which he had himself been invested. At this ceremony were a number of spectators of dis- tinguished rank and character; one of whom, after de- scribing all that passed, adds these words : \u2014 \" Nothing can be more simple thau the ceremony of this installation ; but this very simplicity has something in it so delightful, so noble, and so nearly resembling the grandeur of anti- quity, that it commands our reverence, and seizes upon our worthiest affections. I speak at least of the effect it produced on my feelings. This change of the persons exercising the most awful functions of. the state, with so little pomp, but with so great solemnity ; and which places a man, who the evening before was among the crowd of simple citizens, at the head of the government; while he who held the first office ofthe state the preceding evening, is returned again to the class of simple citizens, is full of the qualities that constitute, true greatness.\" The late president having paid his affectionate com- pliments to his successor, bid adieu to the seat of govern- ment, and hastened to the delights of domestic life. He intended that his journey should have been private, but the attempt was vain : the same affectionate and respect- ful attentions were on this occasion paid him which he had received during his presidency. At this time there was only one cloud that obscured the political horizon of the United States. France had assumed a threatening atti- tude ; but for the peace and safety of the country, the general confided in the patriotism of. his fellow citizens, under the providence of heaven. Among other indignities offered by the French government, the American envoys had been rejected ; indeed for years, the insults received by the United States from the successive administrations of France, through their ambassadors and otherwise, had been intolerable, and were endured with a degree of pa- tience of which the history of nations canscarcely produce an example. Their ships were every where captured ; their ministers were little better than prisoners at Paris ; while agents, some of them clothed with the sacred cha- racter of ambassadors, had endeavoured to excite the seeds of civil war. When at length the indignities of the diiec-"], [215, "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 19S. tory exceeded endurance, and the spirit of the American nation was roused to resistaace, the congress resolved to arm by land and sea. General Washington was appointed \" commander in chief of the armies raised and to be raised,\" and, he accept ed the commission ; because he observed, \" that every thing they held dear and sacred was threatened ; though he had flattered himself that be had quitted for ever ths boundless field of public action, incessant trouble, and, high responsibility, in which he had so long acted so con spicuous a part.\" In this office be continued during the short period of his life which still remained. On Friday,, December, 13, 1799, in consequence of being out during rain, he was seized with an inflammation in the throat. Conceiving that bleeding would be salutary, a vein was, opened ; but he could not be persuaded to send for his physician until the morning. About eleven o'clock on Saturday, Dr. Craik arrived, and\" perceiving his extreme danger, desired the advice of two more physicians, but their assistance was unavailing. At half past eleven that night, December 14, he expired, in the 68th year of his age, and the 23d year of American independence ; of which he may be said to be the principal founder and. sup porter. He died with a deep sense of piety, observing to Dr. Craik, \" Doctor, I am dying, and have been dying for a long time ; but I am not afraid to die:\" after which, with perfect serenity, he surrendered himself to his God. The precautions which the United States had taken against the injustice ofthe French government, preserved their independence, without coming to an open rupture ; aud all differences were at length composed by a treaty of amity and commerce which was signed at Paris, on the 30th of September, 1800, by plenipotentiaries from the two republics At this period, and indeed until 1806, the United States were in an enviable state of prosperity ; no nation ever enjoying greater happiness. The commerce of the country, and particularly its exports, had most wonderfully increased. Early in 1801, intelligence was received in London, that the ratification between France and America had taken place. About the same time came on the election for a new president of the United States, in the room of Mr. Adams, who during the last years of his presidency, had become extremely unpopular. Mr. Jefferson, the vice-president, and Mr. Burr, were candidates for this important office ; and the. election was carried on with great warmth on both sides. During three successive"], [216, "200 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. days, the balloting was renewed no less than thirty-one times; the thirty-second time decided the contest in favour of Mr. Jefferson. By referring to pages 79 and 91 of this work, it will be found, that from the commencement of this gentleman's administration both the commerce and manufactures of the United States flourished in a manner unprecedented. This may be seen from the tables of exports ; but the reader will find a further confirmation of this fact in page 122, by examining the receipts of customs from 1801 to 1808, when he resigned his office in favour of Mr. Madison. During the first four years of general Washington's admi nistration, the whole value of exports, foreign and domestic, was about 100,000,000 of dollars; whereas, during the years 1803, 4, 5, and 6, they amounted to 330,601,000 dollars. But the foreign articles being chiefly productions of the coloyies belonging to the enemies of Great Britain, the British government in the year 1805, adopted the rule ofthe war of 1756, which rendered illegal any commerce carried on during war by a neutral with the colonies of a belligerent, which had not been permitted during peace. It was, however, the year 1803 which will ever distinguish the wisdom of Mr. Jefferson's councils, by the purchase of Louisiana; a measure which doubled the territory of his country, and that at such a trifling expence (not five farthings an acre) as has justly excited the astonishment of mankind, and will one day be productive of the most important results, not only to the United States but to the world. The British ships of war having began to act with vigour, in pursuance of the order of 1805, vessels and property to a vast amount, belonging to the United States, were seized, tried and condemned. These captures ex cited universal indignation throughout the Union, the administration of which was stigmatized as equally regard less of the honour and interest of the nation, for not resisting these pretensions, and procuring redress for the depredations. In consequence of numerous spirited memorials from the mercantile interest, the senate, on the 10th of February, 1806, passed the following resolution: \u2022' Resolved, that the capture and condemnation, under orders of the British government, of American vessels and their car goes, on pretext of their being employed in a trade with the enemies of Great Britain, is an unprovoked aggression on the property of the citizens of ihe United States ; a violation, of their neutral rig/its ; and an encroach mm t vpon their national indepetu denee.\""], [217, "UNITED STATES OF A.MERICA. 201 Four days afterwards, another resolution was passed, requesting the president to demand the property so cap tured ; to insist upon an indemnification for all losses sus tained by such captures; and also to demand a total re linquishment of the practice of impressing American seamen. To obtain redress for these alledged grievances, four modes presented themselves, viz. negociation, non-inter course, embargo, or war. The first in order, however, was first tried, and the president entered upon negociation. To attach more solemnity to it, Mr. William Pinckney was appointed minister extraordinary, and united with colonel Monroe, then ambassador at London. To give the nego ciation a greater likelihood of success, an act was passed, making a strong appeal to the interest of Great Britain. This act prohibited the importation into the United States, ofavariety of the most important of the British manue tures; but in order to prevent a rupture between the two nations, its operation was not to commence until seven months from the day on which it passed. In De cember it was still farther suspended till the first of July following, and the president was authorised to suspend it still farther till the second Monday of December, 1807, if in his judgment the welfare of the public should seem to require it. But while these important topics were under discussion, a tragical affair occurred, which still further unfortu nately embroiled the two nations. The American frigate Chesapeak, captain Gordon, sailed from Norfolk on the 22d of June, 1807. The British man of war Leopard, of 50 guns, which was moored near her, weighed anchor shortly afterwards. She soon overtook the Chesapeak, and demanded four seamen, three of whom had deserted from a British frigate, and the fourth from a merchantman. Commodore Barron, who was on board, refused to deliver them up ; and in consequence, the Leopard commenced an attack on the American frigate, which was wholly unprepared for resistance. Three men were killed, and sixteen wounded ; among the latter was the commodore, who struck his flag, and surrendered the ship. Captain Humphreys sent an officer on board the Chesapeak, who seized four of her crew ; one of whom, being found guilty of desertion, was hanged at Halifax ; one died in confine ment ; and the other two were retained till June, 1812, a few days previous to the declaration of war, when they were restored to freedom on board the Chesapeak, then at Boston."], [218, "202 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. This transaction excited the utmost indignation through out the United States, and for a time united all parties id the common clamour for reparation of the insult and in jury, or for war. The prudence and caution of the pre sident on this critical occasion were remarkable. The attack took place on the 22d of June, and he delayed the extra meeting of congress to the 26th of October, to affbrd time for the inflammation of the public mind to subside. This wise measure preserved the country from war at that time. But to guard against similar conduct on the part of British ships of war, he published a proclamation forbid ding them to enter into the ports or harbours of the United State*. It is, however, due to justice, and to the spirit of impartiality which it is the Editor's study to preserve throughout this Work, to state, that previous to the sailing ofthe Chesapeak, the British cortsul at Norfolk had made repeated Official demands of these four seamen, which de mands were repelled by the American officers, with the covert*. ence of she ministry at Washington. This refusal led fo the Orders issued by admiral Berkeley, to fake the' men by force. Ott the first ifitellfgence of this unfortunate event in Great Britain, the a_miral was recalled, and his conduct tacitly disavowed by his government; which, however, still maintained its right of recovering from American1 tiitor _____ Vessels, _*_e___fs from the British navy, by force if necessary ;\u2022 while, with respect to the armed ships of Anie ri__, the right Only Went to a requisition for the delivering u>p> d .setters. Of Course admiral Berkeley's conduct w$g admitted __ be' _nji__i_able, and Mr. Rose was despatched oft _ gp__i_l mission to America, with overtures of con eil___o_. Tlie question was not confined merely fo sea _-._y but it in v'olVed1 also (he right of American commerce: it went' to prevent, ift a measure, a free intercourse be tween the ports of A_!_riCa and those of France. Accord ingly a_ erd'e. in court*. il' Was issued' b^ the British mink try, which prevented American vessels for trading fo any port in the possession or under the cori.rol of the enemy. This ovdkv in council, which had been excited by Bolia parte's decree of November, 1806, declaring all the Bri tish islands in a state os' blockade, arid' that they would not be allowed to trade with neutrals, Was\" received with the utmost indigrttttion by' the people and government ofthe United St__>_>; and vva. against England' seemed to-be the general Wish of that dountry Nd' hopes now appeared of a speedy accommodation, and in November,"], [219, "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 203 three other orders in council were issued, by which all neutral vessels bound to France or her dependencies, or to any port from which British vessels were excluded, were declared liable to seizure and condemnation. These orders in council, and the embargo laid on by the American government, in December, 1807, completely cut off all communication between the United States and the rest of the world. The embargo had been resorted to, in order to preserve the property of the merchants from seizure under the French decrees and British orders ; and yet those very merchants and their friends, universally throughout the Union, reprobated the measure as uncon- stitutional, tyrannical, and unjust. In many places the act had been openly violated. The public journals in Boston had invited the citizens to set it at defiance ; aijd another order in council, published at London in April, 1808, held out inducements to the violation of it, by giving express orders to all naval commanders \" not to interrupt any neutral vessel laden with lumber and provisions bound to the British West Indies, or South America, to whom- soever the property may belong, and notwithstanding such vessel may not have regular clearances and documents ou board.\" But such an invitation was quite unnecessary ; there are always to be found, in every community, men who will seek the shortest road to wealth, whether through the devious paths of smuggling, or in any other way by which the object can be obtained. These men united their voice with the clamour of those whose grand object was to harass the government, for the chance of recovering the power they had lost. To prevent evasions, an act was passed to enforce the embargo ; and this was necessarily more strict and severe in its provisions than the original act. Meetings were held in various parts of the United States, denouncing the latter as oppressive and unconstitutional. Petitions were presented from many towns and districts to the pre- sident, praying that the embargo might be taken off. To these he replied, that it had been first resolved on owing to the insults and injuries which American vessels had received from France and England, and it must continue to operate, till there was a suspension of hostilities, or until the decrees and orders in council should be repealed. Soon after this, however, on the 8th of November, Mr. Jefferson informed congress, that anxious to remove the ill consequences of the embargo, he had authorised tbe American ministers at London and Paris to propose, 2 D"], [220, "204 UNITED STATES OF A.MER1CA. that the commerce of America should be exclusively opened to which ever of the powers at war rescinded the decrees which had occasioned the embargo. Great Britain had rejected this offer, and France having returned no answer, he observed that nothing remained for them but to persevere in a system which had been forced upon them. But the opposition excited agaiust the embargo, the tumultuous proceedings in the eastern states, its inefficacy to answer the purpose intended, arising partly from the disorganizing resistance it met with, and partly in the president's weakness in not enforcing it, all combined to produce its repeal, which took place on the lst of March, 1809. On the same day, as a pacific measure, in lieu of the embargo, to induce France and England to respect American rights, the non-intercourse act was passed. This law was immediately denounced as feeble and im becile, by ninety-nine out of every 100 democrats in the United States. But an impartial view of it will prove the folly of this denunciation ; it evinces a sincere wish to return to the relations of peace and friendship with either or both the powers at war, aud an ardent desire to try every rational mode of procuring redress previous to a recourse to the horrors of war. At this time a transaction took place, which afterwards occasioned considerable discussion both in the United States and in Great Britain. It appears that the governor general of Canada had employed a Mr. Henry on a mission to the eastern states, to ascertain the views of the disaf fected, and how far, if they obtained \" a decided influ ence,\" they would \"exeit that influence to bring about a separation from the general union.\" Also, \" how far, in such an event, they would look to England for assist ance, or be disposed to enter into a connexion with us\" [the people of Canada]. Between the 26th of January and the 12th of June, 1809, twenty letters upon this dan gerous subject passed between Mr. Henry and his employer ; but a misunderstanding having taken place among the parties concerned, Henry applied to the Bri tish ministry for a remuneration of his services. Being disappointed in the expected reward, and irritated to revenge, he repaired to Washington, and sold his secret to the American government, who gave him 50,000 dol lars for his discoveries, and breach of faith to his original employers. On the 17th of April, 1809, just forty-four days after Mr. Madison's appointment to the presidency, Mr. Erskine,"], [221, "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 205 the British ambassador to the United States, made candid overtures for an accommodation of the existing differ ences between the two countries. They were received with a spirit of frankness and promptitude never exceed ed, and a reply given the same day. Mr. Erskine's second letter, and the answer of the secretary of state are both dated on the 18th ; and both parties being sincerely desi rous of a reconciliation, an equitable arrangement was finally adjusted on the day following. The president immediately issued a proclamation announcing, . that in consequence of the determination of the British govern ment to withdraw the orders in council on the 10th day of June next, after that day the trade between the United States and Great Britain may be renewed, and carried on as formerly.\" Thus, in the short space of two days, all misunder standing was amicably adjusted, and friendly inter course restored, without compromising the honour or the interest of either nation. In an evil hour for both countries, this equitable and honourable arrangement was fatuitously rejected by the British ministry, and the two governments again involved in the most vexatious discussions. The reason assigned for not ratifying the above agree ment was, that Mr. Erskine had exceeded his instructions; and had this actually been the case, the rejection might perhaps be justified. But the fact is, that the interests of both nations were equally secured ; and to prevent any difficulty in the adjustment of the dispute, the president allowed the thorny and difficult subject of impressment to be laid aside for future negociation. The impressment of American seamen having been mentioned, and the extent to which it was carried often greatly exaggerated, and in general misconceived in this country, the following official statements will place the subject in a correct point of view : \" A statement of applications made to the British government on 1538 cases of impressed seamen, claiming to be citizens of the United States, during the space of eighteen months, by George Erving, agent for the relief and protection of American seamen.\" Duplicates of former applications 306 Original applications 1232 \u25a0~ 1 Doo"], [222, "206 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

Mr. Erskine's negociation having been disallowed by his own government, still the United States were unwil- ling to proceed to extremities ; thinking they could bring Great Britain to their own terms without having recourse to the hazardous experiment of making war. The non- intercourse act which had been passed on the lst of March, though injurious to the interests of both coun- tries, was, in some respects beneficial to them. British manufactures being prohibited, the Americans began to manufacture for themselves ; and Britain being no longer able to supply her West India islands with provisions and lumber from the United States, had recourse to her own settlements in Canada and Nova Scotia, where she found every thing that her islands stood in need of. The emperor of France, taking advantage of the fresh cause of dispute between the two countries, announced that his commercial decrees, so far as they operated to re- strict the trade of America, should be repealed; provided that Great Britain should revoke her orders in council, or that the United States should cause their rights to be re- spected by the English. The Americans, relying on the repeal ofthe French decrees, resumed their trade with that nation ; npon which several of their vessels were captured by the British cruisers, as violating the orders in council, while many of those who reached the ports of France, were detained by the French government, either because their cargoes were suspected to be British, or because they had not strictly complied with the regulations established for the admission of American cargoes. The American ambassador at the court of London remonstrated against the measures pursued by the English government; and alleged, that as the French decrees were recalled by Bona- parte, so likewise the British orders in council should be revoked. But the ministry naturally required, that the restrictive decrees of France should not only be blotted from the statute book, but also from practice, before it would be safe or proper to rescind the orders in council. It was also insisted on, that American vessels should have free and unmolested admittance to all ports of the conti nent under the power of Bonaparte, even though they had touched at the British dominions, before any part of the maritime laws of England could be altered. The French emperor, by his ambiguous and conditional revocation of the above-mentioned decrees, rendered the differences between Great Britain and the United States"], [224, "208 UNITED STATES OF A.MERICA. still more intricate and difficult of accommodation ; and afforded the American people an additional pretext for charging our government with a breach of faith, and with a desire to establish a tyranny by sea. In this disagreeable predicament the matters in dispute remained at the end of the year 1810. In the following year an unfortunate event occurred, which, under present circumstances, was well calculated to produce an immediate rupture between the two coun- tries. The American frigate President, one ofthe largest of her rate, and the English ship of war Little Belt, a ves- sel inferior in force to the smallest frigate, met and en- gaged : the captain and crew of each maintained that the first shot was fired by the other. Here, then was a fresh subject for dispute, and in the beginning- of November, in a message fo congress, the president adduced it as a suffi- cient reason why the United States should arm, in order fo vindicate, at the point of the sword, tho.se rights that had been trampled on by Great Britain. On the 6th of December, the committee appointed to examine the nature. of foreign relations, recommended an immediate war, and called npon congress aud the country to bring forth and exert the utmost energies ofthe nation. From this period, preparations were made on both sides, to ensure success in a conteflSt which was now considered as unavoidable. On the 24th of December, congress passed an act for completing the existing military establishments. Indeed, nearly the whole session was spent in preparing for hostilities. Between the 11th of January and the 14th of May, 1812, no less than fourteen acts received the sanc- tion of the president, all providing for offensive and defen- sive operations. Among these new laws the most import- ant, were, an act to raise an additional military force, to be engaged for five years; the infantry to consist of 20,000 men; the artillery 4000, and the cavalry 1000. Au act authorising the president to accept the services of certain volunteer militia corps, not to exceed 50,000 men; and appropriating 1,000,000 dollars for that purpose. Also an .ict, allowing 10,000,000 dollars for the support of the military establishment in 1812. Likewise another act, ap- propriating 2,900,000 dollars to the support of the navy during- the same period. In March and April, acts were passed feir securing the maritime frontier, and setting apart 16,000,000 dollars for (hat service ; for applying 300,000 dollars in repairing the Constellation, Chesapeak, and Adams frig;! tes ; for allow ing 200,000 dollars annually for three year, to purchase"], [225, "TNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 209 ship-timber; and for re-building the frigates Philadelphia* General (. reen, New York, and Boston; for authorising 100,000 militia to be called out, and appointing 1,000,000 dollars for their support ; and an art for a loan of 1 1,000,000 dollars, to defray part ofthe above expences. But the period had now arrived, when the long-protract ed disputes between the two nations were to be decided by the sword. The session of tbe twelfth congress had con tinued to sit an unusual length of time, and the eyes ofthe nation were turned towards it in anxious expectation. On the 5th of June, the president laid before congress the correspondence between the secretary of state and the British ambassador, which seemed to preclude all hope of adjustment, in the two principal points in dispute, the orders in council, and the subject of impressment. But a rupture between the two countries had been so often on the point of takiDg place, and still happily prevented, that no certain conjecture could be formed, by the most intelli gent, ofthe pr. babie result. The public voice throughout the Union called loudly for war; at least this was thc sense \u00a9fa great majority ofthe people. At length, on the 18th of .June, 1812, after a long sit ting with closed doors, the solemn and important appeal to arms was announced ; after a momentous session of more than seven months, and the most ardent and ani mated debates. The president had communicated his message, in which all the complaints against the British government were enumerated with great force, and an opinion that no remedy, no hope now remained but in open war. The committee of foreign relations, to whom ihe message was referred, concurred with the president in recommending hostilities. An act of congress was accord ingly passed, by a majority in the senate of nineteen to thirteen, and in the house of representatives, by seventy nine to forty-nine : affirmatives in both houses, ninety eight; negatives, sixty-two; that is, more than three to two in both houses united. This memorable act received the sanction ofthe president on the same day, and on the day following, war was publicly proclaimed against Great Britain in due form. War was now become the law of the land ; but it was variously received. In some places it produced demon strations of joy, similar to that which followed the decla ration of independence ; and th\u00a3 effect in many parts of the northern states was different. The commerce of the cities, although for some years much restricted by the two great contending powers of Europe, still lingered i_ hopes"], [226, "210 UNITED STATES OF A.MERICA. of better times; but the war put an end to those hopes \u2014 their ships must be laid up, and their business cease. In different parts of the Union, the war would necessarily be more severely felt ; as must be the case in every extensive country. Besides, there were those who regarded hosti- lities with Britain as a most interesting and eventful expe- riment. An opinion prevailed, that the form of govern- ment in the United States was not adapted to war, from the want of energy in the executive branch, and from un- avoidable divisions in the national councils. But what was much more to be feared, the union of the states had scarcely been perfectly cemented ; and if the interest of any extensive portion should suffer too severely, a dissolu- tion of the federal compact might ensue. A powerful party was opposed to the measure, on the ground that an accommodation with England migbt yet be made. Many others entertained the belief, that all hopes of negociation were at an end, that the Canadas would fall, that Florida would be captured, that the states would than be freed from troublesome neighbours, and all con- tentions with the Indians end for ever. These hopes might not be ill founded ; but those who entertained them were not fully aware of the deficiency of their country in experience and resources ; the causes of many subsequent calamities. For some years previous to the declaration of war, a mi- litary spirit had been gradually diffusing itself among the people. Much pains were taken in disciplining volunteer companies, and a degree of pride and emulation was every where felt, to excel in military exercises: they seemed to be actuated by a kind of instinct, to prepare for the ap- proach of war. But the regular military establishments of the country were exceedingly defective. The act of congress for raising 25,000 men could not be accom- plished ; it being found impossible to fill the ranks of a regular army, from the very small number of individuals who were not in comfortable circumstances, aud therefore under no necessity of enlisting. This must ever be the case in a country where the working commuuitv are ade- quately paid for their labour, as in the United States, and not at the mere will of unprincipled task- masters. The whole nrfmber already enlisted scarcely exceeded 9,000 men, and the militia, which the president was au thorised to call out, could not be expected to be other wise serviceable, than in defending the sea-coast or the frontier. A difficulty of still greater importance occurred ; the best troops in the world are inefficient, unless they"], [227, "211 U.NITED STATES OF AMERICA. are led by able and experienced officers. The ablest com manders in the revolutionary war had paid the debt of na ture, and those who remained were far advanced in life, and from long repose had laid aside their military habits. There prevailed, however, a disposition to place reliance on the officers of the revolution, from the mere circum stance of having been such ; an error which was not cor rected until severely schooled by experience. \u2014 Such was the situation of affairs, previous to the commencement of hostilities. But from the hour when war was declared, a steady and systematical opposition was regularly organized against it. The measure itself, and its authors and abettors, were de- nounced with the utmost virulence. It was, however, at first opposed on the ground of inexpediency, and the want of preparation. Afterwards its opposers rose in their de- nunciations, and asserted that it was unholy, wicked, base, perfidious, unjust, cruel, and corrupt. Every man who in any degree co-operated in it, or gave assistance to carry it on, was loaded with execration; and in one ofthe daily papers it was pronounced to be \" the most wicked and un just war that ever was waged.\" The reader who has pe- rused the account of Mr. Henry's mission from Canada to Massachusetts, and some other of the eastern states, will not be surprised at this violent and rebellious opposition, A party had been formed, denominated the \" Peace Party,\" which combined nearly the whole ofthe federal ists* throughout the Union. Their object was, to expose the war, the administration, the congress who declared it, and all who supported it, to reprobation ; and to force the government to make peace. This party embraced various descriptions of persons, all enlisted under the ban ners of federalism ; whom, as the history of that period is but little known in this country, it may not be improper to enumerate. First, those who were clamorous for war with England in 1793, during Washington's administration, for the in juries she had inflicted on their commerce. Secondly, those who, in 1798, while Adams held the presidency, declared and supported the war against France for similar reasons. Thirdly, those who were vociferous for war against Spain, in 1803, when Jefferson was president; because she interdicted the United States from the right of deposit at New Orleans. * S;e page 59. 2 U"], [228, "212 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. Fourthly, those who in 1805-6, under the same admi nistration, urged the government to \" resist the aggres sions of England,\" as they then expressed themselves, and to make the alternative \u2014 redress of wrongs, or war. Fifthly, those who, after the attack upon the Chesa peak, in 1807, were urgent for war, as the only mode, according to them, in which satisfaction could be had for the \" outrage and insult.\" To enable the reader to make a fair comparison of the several degrees of complaint, at these several periods of time, a synoptical view of them is annexed : The calm observer may perhaps feel some degree of as tonishment, on reading the above account of dissensions __ that existed in the United States, at the commencement of hostilities in 1812; but should he inform' himself on the nature and existence of prejudice, passion, obstinacy, and, above all, with the character anl influence of party- spirit, the mystery would vanish at once : for he would then see that these, and not reason, decide upon political questions. The attention of all men, of whatever party, was now directed to the time and place when and where the first blow would be Struck ; and it was generally believed that Canada would be the first scene of action. It was the uni versal opinion, that at this time, military preparations in that province, were in no greater state of forwardness than on the part of the United States.

His force consisted of 1,000 regulars and 1,200 volunteers from the state of Ohio. At Urbanna, in Virginia, he was joined by the fourth regjment of infantry, and immediately com menced his march through a marshy country, without roads for 120 miles. It was on the last of June when this little army reached the Rapids, having encountered considerable obstacles, in passing through a gloomy and almost trackless wilderuess ; on the Sth of July they encamped at Spring-wells, within a few miles of Detroit. This was deemed the favourable moment for commenc ing active operations against Upper Canada, and an im mediate invasion was determined on. The British, aware of the design, began to throw up a battery to oppose the landing; and, after being twice foiled in the attempt, succeeded the third time, mounting seven small cannon and two mortars. On the 12th, the American troops em barked, and landed without opposition, some distance above the fort. They immediately took possession ofthe village of Sandwich, but found that the principal part of the inhabitants had been marched to Maiden, to assist in the defence of that place. A proclamation was now issued by Hull, declaring his intention of invading Canada, but assuring protection to the inhabitants, and advising them to take no part in the contest, ln a few days pos session was taken of the whole country along the river Thames, a beautiful river, whose borders are highly culti vated, and well settled. A force of 280 men was then despatched against fort Maiden, situated at the junction of Detroit river with lake Erie, and thirteen miles from gene ral Hull's camp. When the advanced party reached Canard's river, four miles above Maiden, it was found that the British had taken possession ofthe bridge; the other part of the de tachment, which was to have forded the river five miles below, was frustrated in their design, from ignorance of the country : in the mean time, the alarm had been given, and all the posts were considerably reinforced. This in duced the invading army to retire; but several skirmishes ensued, with various success, in which both sides sustained considerable loss. These partial actions, however, were only preludes to the great object in view, the reduction of sort Maiden ; preparations for which proceeded but slowly : indeed it seemed that every thing was to be got"], [230, "214 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. ready after the invasion It was not until near the begin- ning of August, that two 2-1-pounders and three howitzers were mounted ; and no attempt ia the meanwhile had been made upon the fort. But a most unexper ted disaster had happened to the Americans during the preceding month. This was the capture of Michillimackinac, on the 17th o July, by a strong party of British troops and Indians, which had embarked at St. Joseph's the day before. The loss of this fort, which was garrisoned by only one lieu tenant and fifty-six men, was afterwards severely felt. It had been called the American Gibraltar; and from its situation on a strait of the same name, which connects lakes Michigan and Huron, 240 miles distant from Detroit, it completely commands the north-west trade, which is compelled to pass under the batteries. This intelligence reached general Hull on the 23d of July, while engaged in preparing for the attack on Mai den. The British, by this time, were considerably rein forced, and aided by an additional number of Indians. The golden moment had been suffered to pass. The offi cers of the besieging army had given their opinion, that the fort must inevitably fall, if an assault was made in the first instance ; but the general declined under various pre texts ; one of which was, that he had received no positive instructions to invade Canada ! But he soon became fully sensible of his error ; the necessity of possessing the post becoming every day more apparent. With the fall of Michillimackinac, Chicago, on lake Michigan, and all the other western posts, might be expected to follow, and the Indian tribes would move down with all their united force, rendering- the situation of his army extremely critical. Foreseeing these events, he had sent repeated expresses for reinforcements, in confident expectation of which, he delayed the attack on Maiden, contenting himself with carrying on a vigilant partisan war, in itself of little con sequence. Reinforcements were not hastened, from the confident belief which prevailed, that the force under his command was fully sufficient for all the purposes which could be accri in that quarter. The spirits which had hitherto -i-.iimated the troops, were now giving way to feelings of despondency ; while their commander had by this time nearly lost their confidence. By the first of August, everything being ready for the long-intended attack, a council of war was summoned, and the result was a determination to make it immediately. This decision met the general's approval, and the day was actually appointed when the attempt would be made. A"], [231, "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 21s. short time previous to this, a detachment of Ohio volun teers had arrived at the river Raisin, with supplies for Hull's army. As they had experienced difficulties on their march, by the attacks of the enemy, it was thought pru dent to send _ body of troops for their protection. Accor dingly major Vanhorn, with 150 men, was sent upon that important duty. On his second day's march, near Browns town, he was suddenly attacked on all sides by British and Indians, when after a severe conflict, in which he had nineteen killed and nine wounded, he succeeded in bring ing off his detachment. Among the killed were three captains ; one captain and a subaltern were wounded. Scarcely had major Vanhorn 's partyT proceeded on their expedition, when a sudden and unexpected change took place in the determination of the commander in chief. Without any apparent cause, he announced his intention of abandoning not only the design upon Maiden, but even the position which he then held ! This operated, like a thunderbolt upon his army ; the volunteers murmured loudly ; they upbraided their commander with cowardice, and even treachery; and it was with difficulty they could be restrained by their own officers, in whom they confided. The troops were re-embarked, and reached the opposite shore on the 8th of August. Such was the termination of this ill-judged expedition into Canada, of whose success, an account was every moment expected in the United States ; but it was decreed that the misfortunes of their arms should not terminate here. A detachment of about 300 men was left at Sandwich, for the purpose of protect ing the Canadians who had been induced, by general Hull's proclamation, to join the American standard. One thing was now on all hands considered indispens able, the opening the communication with the river Raisin, where the situation of the troops, having in possession the supplies for the army, was rendered extremely unpleasant, being cut off from all intercourse with the state of Ohio. To effect this object, 300 regulars and 200 militia were de tached, under the command of colonel Miller. The force of the enemy had been increased by a large body of Indians, under the celebrated chief Tecumsech.* The \u2022 This distinguished warrior, and extraordinary man, had rpeeived the stamp of greatness from the hand of nature. He was tbe determined foe of civilization, and had for years been labouring to unite al! the Indian tribes in opposing the progress of the settlements to the westward. He possessed a bold and commanding elo quence, infinitely superior to whatever has been recorded of any of his countrymen ; and he exhausted every topic calculated to operate on their minds, and alienate their affections from the white people. Amongst the different nations his speeches had a powerful effect ; but especially among the Creeks. This savage Demos-"], [232, "216 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. whole was commanded by major Muir, ofthe British army. On the 9th, the Americans moved forward with great caution, fearing a surprise ; they, nevertheless, fell into the ambuscade, and their advanced guard, under captain Snelling, was suddenly attacked by the English, accom panied by the usual barbarous shouts of the Indians. This combined and vigorous assault was firmly withstood by the American troops, until their main body approached, when a severe engagement ensued, in which Tecumsech and his savages fought with desperate obstinacy. After an obsti nate resistance of two hours, captuin Snelling was obliged to retreat, having had fifteen killed, and above sixty wounded. The British who retired slowly, and in good order to Brownstown, had only three killed, and thirteen Wounded, among the latter were two officers ; but of the Indians, nearly 100 were left ou the field. About this time, general Hull had sent orders to captain Heald, who commanded at fort Chicago, to abandon that post, and proceed to Detroit. He accordingly proceeded on his route, with his company of militia, about fifty regu lars, and accompanied by several families who had resided in and near the place. On his march he was attacked by a large body of Indians, who soon gained his rear, and seized his horses and baggage. He then reached an open place, and kept the enemy at bay for some time ; but find ing that he should be compelled to yield at last, he accept ed the offer of protection from an Indian chief. Twenty-six regulars were killed, and all the militia ; a number of \u25a0women and children were murdered by the savages. Among the killed were captain Wells aud ensign Waruer; the commander, who was desperately wounded, with his lady, who had received six wonnds, after many escapes, at length reached Michillimackinac. On the 14th, colonels Miller and Cass, with 350 men, were despatched to the riv^r Raisin for the purpose of escorting the provisions for the troops, whicl) still remain ed there under the charge of captain Brush. On the 19th, tbe British took a position opposite Detroit, and summon ed the place to sui ,-. To this summons an answer was returned, that the fort would be defended to the last extremity. As the enemy approached, major Denny, who commanded at Sandwich, abandoned his position and crossed over to Detroit, it having been determined to act Shcnes, wherever he went, called councils of the tribps, and with that high-toned energy for which he was celebrated, never failed to convince and attach his auditors. Had such a mun opposed the first settlement of Enrop ans, in all probability .America would still have been a wilderness."], [233, "217 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. entirely on the defensive. The British immediately open ed their batteries, and continued to throw shells during a great part of the night. The fire was returned, but little effect was produced ou either side, ln the morning, it was discovered that the British were lauding their troops at Spring-wells, uuder cover of their shipping; nor was it possible to prevent them from disemburkiug by the guns of the fort, the town lying between them and the river. But if general Hull had not neglected the advice of his officers, he might have effectually prevented it, by erect ing batteries ou the bank. A strange fatality seemed to attend this unfortunate man in every thing he did, or neglected to do. All the British troops having been landed about ten o'clock, advanced towards the fort in close column and twelve deep. The American forces was judiciously dis posed to prevent their approach; the militia and volun teers occupied the town, or were posted behind pickets, whence they could annoy the enemy's flanks ; the regulars defended the fort, and two 24-pounders, loaded with grape-shot, were posted on an eminence, and could sweep the whole of the British line, should they venture to ad vance. All was uow silent expectation; the intrepid foe still slowly moved forward, as if in utter contempt of death ; but they had still greater contempt for a comman der who had so meanly abandoned Sandwich a few days before. But who can describe the astonishment of the American troops, when they were ordered not to fire ; and that at the very moment when they thought the enemy were advancing to certain destruction ! The whole force, witha great number of women and children, were gathered into the fort, almost too narrow to contain them. Here the troops were ordered to stack their arms, and to the amazement of every one, a white flag, in token of submis sion, was suspended from the walls. A British officer rode up to ascertain the cause, for this surrender was no less unexpected to the assailants. A capitulation was agreed to, without even stipulating the terms. Words are wanting to express the indignant feelings of the Americans on this occasion ; they considered them selves basely betrayed, in thus surrendering to an inferior force without firing a gun, when they had the enemy com pletely in their power. They had at least fifteen days provisions iu the garrison, and were well supplied with arms and ammunition ; notwithstanding which, they were compelled, thus humiliated, to march out, and to surren der themselves prisoners at discretion. The British took"], [234, "218 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. immediate possession of the fort, with all the public pro perty ; amongst which were forty barrels of gunpowder, 400 rounds of fi.xed 24-pound shot, 100,000 ball cartridges, 2,500 stand of arms, twenty-five pieces of iron cannon, and eight of brass ; the greater part of which had been captured by the Americans during the revolution. By (his disgraceful surrender the whole Michigan terri tory, of which Detroit is the chief town, containing 27,000 square miles, was given up to the British, with all the forts and garrisons within general Hull's district, and the detachments under colonels Cass, Miller, and M'Arthur, as well as the party under captain Brush, were included in the capitulation. The latter indignantly refused to surrender, declaring that Hull had no right to include him, and determined to return to the state of Ohio. The number of American troops made prisoners of war amounted to 2,800, while the whole British force consisted of no more than 700 regulars and militia, and 600 Indians. The Ohio and Michigan volunteers and militia were permitted to return home, but the regulars, together with the general, were taken to Quebec. The sensations produced by this event, throughout the United States, and particularly in the western coun try, can scarcely be described. At first, no one could believe so extraordinary and unexpected an occurrence. It had not even been supposed that the situation of Hull was critical, ner was it doubted by any person that he was fully able at least to defend himself. He was after wards exchanged for thirty British prisoners, and brought before a court-martial. He was charged with treason, cowardice, and unofficer-like conduct. On the first charge the court declined giving an opinion, on the two last he was .sentenced to suffer death ; but was recom mended to mercy on account of his former services and advanced age. The sentence was remitted by the presi dent; but his name was ordered to be struck from the rolls of the army. He afterwards published a vindication of his conduct, without effect, the public mind being too well satisfied. Naval transactions. \u2014 At the moment ofthe declaration of war, a squadron under commodore Rodgers, consisting of the President, Congress, and United States frigates, with the brig Hornet, had rendezvoused off Sandy Hook. On the 21st of June they put to sea, in search of a small British squadron which bad sailed as the convoy of the West"], [235, "219 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. India fleet. While thus engaged, the British frigate Belvi dera was discovered, to which they gave chase. The Presi dent, which outsailed the other vessels, had come within gun-shot, and commenced firing with her bow guns, which the Belvidera returned with her stern chafers. In about ten minutes, one ofthe President's gunsburst, killedandwound ed sixteen men, and fractured the commodore's leg. By this accident the deck was so completely shattered, as to ren der all the guns on that side useless. The Belvidera then shot ahead, and escaped from all her pursuers. After this, the American squadron proceeded after the West India convoy as far as the British channel, without falling in with them ; they then stood for Madeira, the Azores, and Newfoundland, and arrived at Boston on the 30th of August, having made very few captures. On the 3d of July, the frigate Essex, sailed from New York, and nine days afterwards the Constitution, captain Hull, put to sea from the Chesapeak ; at the same lime, the brigs Nautilus, Viper, and Vixen were cruising off the eoast ; the Wasp sloop of war was on her return from France. On the morning of the 17th, the Constitutiou, then off Egg-harbour, was chased by a British ship of the line and three frigates, which were rapidly approaching with a fine breeze, while the American frigate was nearly becalmed. At sun rise the next morning, escape was al most hopeless, the enemy being only five miles distant, asld the seventy-four towed by all the boats of the squa dron. Captain Hull then sent boats ahead to warp the ship, and the enemy immediately resorted to the same ex pedient. In this manner the chase continued for two days, par .y sailing and partly warping, when the squadron was left out of sight by the Constitution. This escape was con sidered as deserving a high rank in naval exploits, and was much admired at the time, proving great nautical skill. On the 2d of August, the Constitution again put to sea, and on the 19th discovered the British frigate Guerrier, who immediately backed her main-topsail and waited for the enemy. After much tacking and man\u0153uvring on both sides for three quarters of an hour, during which the Guerrier attempted to board, both vessels were brought alons side of each other, when a furious actioncominenced for thirty minutes, which ended in the capture of the Guerrier, after being: reduced to a mere wreck, and having lost fifteen killed and sixty-three wounded: the Constitu tion had seven killed and seven wounded ; but was so little injured in her hull and rigging, that when a ship appeared NO. x. 2 F"], [236, "220 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. next day, she actually prepared for action. The Guerrier was so much damaged that it was found impossible to take her into port, she was therefore burut at sea. It will be proper to observe in this place, that the Constitution was ofa force much superior to the British frigate. ' Never did any event produce such universal joy over the United States. Captain Hull and his officers were re ceived with enthusiastic gratitude wherever they appeared. In all the cities through which the captain passed he was presented with his freedom, and also many valuable dona tions. Congress voted 50,000 dollars to the crew, as a re eompen.se for the loss of the prize, and several of the officers were promoted. The public mind was now continually excited by some new series of naval exploits. On the 7th of September, commodore Porter, of tbe Essex, entered the Delaware, after a most successful cruise of two months, during which he captured a brig with 150 soldiers on board, which was ransomed for 14,000 dollars; the men were disarmed and released, on taking au oath not to serve against the United States during the war. He also captured, on the 13th of August, the Alert sloop of war, after an action of eight minutes. When she struck her colours, she had but three men wounded; but there were seven feet water iu her hold. Being now embarrassed with prisoners, above 500 in number, the Alert was converted into a cartel, and she was sent to St. John's in order to procure an exchange. The Essex was afterwards chased by two ships of war, but escaped by skilful man\u0153uvring. On the 8th of October, the President, United States, Congress, and Argus, sailed from Boston, and on the 13th captured the British packet Swallow, containing 200,000 dollars. After a very successful cruise, they returned to the same port on the 30th of December. The Argus, which had sepaiated from the others iu a gale of wind, after being out ninefv-six days, arrived at New York with prizes to the amount of 200,000 dollars. Tlie United States, commodore Decatur, had also separated from the squadron, and on the 25th of October, off the Western Isles, fell in with the Macedonian frigate, captain Carden, a brave and honourable officer. After a severe action of nearly two hours, in a very heavy sea, the Mecedonian having lost her main-mast, main-topmast,' and main yard, and being much cut up in her hull, struck her colours. She had thirty-six killed and sixty -eight wounded, while the United States had only five killed and seven wounded ; but, as in the case ofthe Guerrier and Constitution, there"], [237, "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 221 was great difference in the size of the ships. The United States measured 176 sect deck, and forty-two feet beam, her gun-deck six feet six inches high, she had fifteen port holes on aside, and carried 24-pounders on her main deck. The Macedonian had hi. feet deck, forty-two feet eight inches beam, her gun-deck six feet ten inches high, fifteen port-holes on a side, and carried 18-pounders on her main deck. The news of this engagement had scarce time to subside, when intelligence of another was received, fought with the same desperate resolution on both sides ; the Wasp sloop of war, captain Jones, had returned from France, after carrying over Mr. Crawford, the American ambassa- dor. On the 13th of October, he again put to sea, and on the 17th descried six British merchant ships, under convoy of a brig and two ships of sixteen guns each. The brig, which proved to be the Frolic, captain Whinyates, drop- ped bebind, while the others made sail. The Wasp then prepared for action, which was commenced by the Frolie's cannon and musketry, and both ships soon became closely engaged. In five minutes the Wasp's main-topmast was shot away, and in two minutes more, her gaff and mizzen top-gailant-mast followed ; by these means her yards were rendered unmanageable during the action. The sea running very high, the muzzles of the Wasp's guns were sometimes under water, but were always fired while the vessel was descending : on the contrary, the Frolic's guns were discharged as she rose. By these means the shot of the former scarcely ever missed the enemy, while that of the latter was either thrown away, or went through the rigging of her antagonist. At length, the ships approached so close, that in the last broadside the rammers touched the opposite vessel. An opportunity now offering, the Wasp swept the decks of the Frolic by a rak- ing fire, and then boarded her ; but to the astonishment of the boarders, no person was found on the quarter-deck except three officers and the man at the whee! ! The deck was quite slippery with blood, and presented a scene of havoc and ruin not often witnessed. The colours were still flying:, there being no seaman to pull them down. Lieutenant Biddle, of the Wasp, hauled them down him self, and received the sword ofthe brave officer who com manded her. The Frolic was taken possession of in forty three minutes, after one of the- most bloody conflicts recorded in naval history. The condition of this unfortu nate vessel was inexpressibly shocking ; the birth-deck being covered wife the dead, the dying, and the wounded ;"], [238, "222 UNITED STATES OF A.MERICA. and the masts, which soon after fell, covering them and every thing else on deck, left her a most melancholy wreck. The loss on board the Frolic was never properly ascertained ; but has been stated at thirty killed and above forty wounded : that of the Wasp was live killed and five wounded. Both ships were captured the same day by a British seventy-sour, the Poictiers, captain Beresford. Northwestern and northern armies, Canada frontier, military movements, <_c. \u2014 The public mind having re covered from t_;e distress occasioned by the surrender of general Hull, was now carried to ihe contrary extreme. To the westward and to the southward, volunteer corps were forming in every quarter, and tendering their ser vices for any enterprise. This patriotic spirit was conspi cuous in the western parts of Pennsylvania and Virginia, but it was in the states of Kentucky, Ohio, and Tennessee, where it prevailed in the highest degree. Civil pursuits were almost forsaken, and this ardour was confined to no sex. The ladies set themselves to work in preparing mili tary clothing for their friends, ancl they cheerfully contri buted from their household stoek, such articles as were wanted. Companies were equipped in a single day, and were ready to march the next. Thus, in a few weeks, upwards of 4,000 men were drawn from their homes, embodied, and ready for the field. The command of this army was giveu to major-general Harrison, who was appointed by the president commander in chief of the northwestern army. ln consequence of the war with Great Britain, vast num bers of Indians had taken up arms, and commenced their usual barbarities against the people of the United States. General Harrison's first object, therefore, was to relieve the frontier posts, principally sort Harrison, situated on the river Wabash, and fort Wayne, ou the Miami-of-the lakes. He arrived at the former place on the 12th of September, with about 2,500 men, while it was invested by a large body of Indians, who all disappeared at his ap proach. Not thinking it advisable to proceed further without reinforcements, he resolved to occupy the inter mediate time in laying waste the Indian territory. Accord ingly, two detachments were sent out on that service, who succeeded in destroying nine villages, with all the property of the inhabitants. \" General Harrison then pro ceeded to fort Wayne, where he arrived on the 18th, and"], [239, "I XTTED STATES OF AMERICA. 223 sound general Winchester, with considerable reinforce ments from the states of Ohio and Kentucky. On the 23d, genera] Winchester, with about. 2,000 men, set out for fort Defiance, on his way to the Rapids, the place of ultimate destination. After a most distressing march through a wilderness, highly favourable to Indian warfare, on the lst of October, he'took possession of fort Defiance. wbich had been previously evacuated by the British and Indians. On the 4th, general Harrison left the fort and returned to the settlements, with a view of organizing, and bringing up the remainder ofthe army; leaving orders with general Topper to proceed with 1,000 men, to the Rapids, and drive the enemy from that place. From this period to tbe 13th of December, Tupper made three at taDlpts to execute his orders, all of which proved abortive, from the total insubordination of the militia under his command. While these things were taking place in the northwest ern army, other occurrences deserving attention were transpiring further to the westward. The spirit of volun teering had been so highly excited, that the people could not rest contented without doing something. Nearly 4,000 men, chiefly mounted riflemen, under general Hopkins, assembled at Vincennes, in the beginning of October, on an expedition into the Indian country. Before they had proceeded a week on their march, a mutiny arose among them for the want of military subordination, and they re turned in confusion without achieving their object. Several other expeditions were undertaken about this time, against the Indians upon the Wabash and Illinois rivers ; in which many lives were sacrificed on both sides, and'little injury done to the enemy, except the burning of a few villages, and the destruction ofa quantity of corn. It is now time to turn our attention to the northern fron tier, from Niagara down the St. Lawrence. In the fall of the year, an American force, amounting to 4,000 men, had been assembled near Lewistown, on lake Ontario ; another body of troops was stationed at Plattsburgh, on lake Champlain : the former under general Vanranselaer, the latter under the commander in chief, general Dearborne. At several other places on the frontiers, detachments had been stationed, ancl military stores collected at different points. Skilful naval officers were appointed to arm ves sels on lakes Erie, Ontario, and Champlain ; and it was expected that before October, every thing would be ready for a formidable invasion of Canada. Considerable disap pointment, however, was experienced, inconsequence of"], [240, "224 UNITED STATES OF A.MERICA. the governors of Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Connecticut, refusing to permit the militia of those states to march, notwithstanding the orders of tbe president! Nevertheless, between eight and 10,000 men were collected along the extensive frontier, the troops commanded by Vanranselaer were called the anry of the centre, to dis tinguish it from Harrison's army ; and those under the immediate orders of general Dearborne, the army, of the north. About this time an occurrence took place on lake Erie, which, though at first flattering fo the American arms, occasioned most disastrous consequences in the end. On the:8th of October, lieutenant Elliot, 'one of the officers conducting (he naval eqipments, captured the British brigs Detroit and Caledonia, the latter loaded with fur, to the amount of 150,000 dollars: the vessels were carried by boarding, with the loss of only two men killed and four wounded. This affair having kindled the ardour of the American army of tbe centre, they demanded to be led to the invasion of Canada; and some of the volunteers threat ened to return home, unless fheir wishes were complied with. After a conference with the officers, general Van ranselaer resolved to make an attack upon Queenstown, seven miles below the falls of Niagara. Accordingly, at four o'clock, in the morning of tho 1 1th of October, in the midst ofa dreadful storm, and heavy rain, an attempt was made to pass the river; which, from darkness, and various accidents, could not be effected. The failure of this enterprise only served to increase the impatience of tho troops. Orders were therefore issued to prepare for another attempt : and early on the morning of the 13th, the troops embarked, under cover of the bat teries. At day-light, as soon as the American boats could be discovered, a shower of musketry and grape opened from the whole line on the Canada shore ; which com pelled two divisions of the invaders to re-cross the river. The rest succeeded in gaining the heights, when a severe contest ensued, in which the British commander, general Brock, fell, nrfcrtally wounded, and with him fell the post of Queenstown, which was taken possession of by the American troops. But they were not long suffered to re tain it; sor reiuforcements having arrived to the British from fort George, and a large body of their Indian allies being advantageously posted near the scene of action, they were enabled to continue the engagement with great advantage. At two o'clock, the Americau general Wads worth, crossed over and joined his countrymen, and gene-"], [241, "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 225 ral Van ranselaer also passed the river, for the purpose of fortifying a camp ; but perceiving that the men on the opposite side embarked but slowly, he returned to expe dite them. But what was his astonishment, on reaching the American side, when he sound that they positively refused to embark! More than 1,200 meu under arms were drawn up on the bank, where they remained idle spectators ofthe scene, aud neither commands nor entrea ties could prevail on them to move! The Americans were finally defeated, with a loss of nearly 200 killed and wounded, and 900 prisoners, among whom was their com mander, general Wadsworth. Shortly after the unfortunate battle of Queenstown, general Vanranselaer resigned his command, which de volved on brigadier-general Smith. The new comman der immediately announced his intention of retrieving the honour of the American arms, by another attack upon Canada. The necessary preparations having been made, on the 27th of November above 4,500 volunteer* were ready to embark'; but the advanced guard having been vigorously. opposed on their landing, and the main body not coming to their support, they were obliged to return, and the attempt was for that time abandoned. A few days afterwards, the whole body, with the exception of about 200 men, embarked at four o'clock in the morn ing, with every hope of success. Nothing was wanting but the word to move, when, after some delay, orders were suddenly given for the troops to be re-landed, as the invasion of Canada was relinquished for that season. One universal expression of indignation burst forth; the greater part of the militia threw down their arms, and returned to their homes, and those who remained threat ened the life of the general. \u2014 From the declaration of war to this period, the Americans had suffered the effects of total want of experience, and insubordination ; and in nothing more than in their different attempts against Canada. This last affair bad a most unfavourable aspect, both at home and abroad. It is now time to revert to the northern army, sor which few troops had been collected before late iu the autumn ; it being confidently calculated that the upper part of Canada would fall an easy conquest to the northwestern and center armies. But the unexpected surrender of Hull, produced a total change in the sitnatfon of affairs, and was the cause that nothing of importance was at tempted by the army of the north. Skirmishes, however, were frequent, even during the winter, and incursions"], [242, "226 UNITED STATES OF A.MER1CA. made both by the Americans and the British ; but nothing of consequence was achieved on either side. A new scene of warfare was now to be opened on those vast inland seas, already described, page 29 ; and for the first time their waves were to be lighted up with all the sublimity of naval combat. Commodore Chauncey had fitted up several vessels of war en lake Ontario, and having received notice that the British fleet had sailed down the lake, for the purpose of bringing up reinforce- ments to fort George, he determined to intercept them. On the 8th of November, his squadron descried one of the enemy's ships, the Royal George, of 26 guns, who made her escape into Kingston, where she was so well protected by the batteries, that the Americans were obliged to haul off, with considerable loss. They after- wards captured two schooners, one of which bad on board i 2,000 dollars in specie, and all thc baggage of general Brock, with captain Brock, the general's brother. Soon after this, winter set in and put an end to any further naval operations for the season. Congress again assembled in the beginning of Novem- ber, at a time when party spirit raged throughout the counfry. Their attention was first directed towards rais- ing an additional force; the inefficacy of mere militia, under no discipline, having been sufficiently seen. But there was no mode of remedying the evil, as regular sol- diers, for the reasons already given, could not be pro- cured in sufficient numbers. The navy, therefore, attracted much attention, great unanimity prevailing on this sub jtect; and it was resolved to foster and encourage it, as the best reliance of the country. A war now threatened in another quarter, which occasioned considerable anxiety; the celebrated Indian chief, Tocumnech, had the yea? b.fore. visited all the tribes? in tlie southern states, and, by his powerful eloquence, raised a most unfriendly spirit among those people towards the white inhabitants. Georgia and Tennessee being in the greatest daiiger, the militia of these states were accordingly held in readiness, and in the spring, general Jackson, at the head of 2,000 men, marched through the Indian country to Natchez, a distance of 500 miles; but finding every thing quiet, re turned soon after. Many skirmishes, however, afterwards took place in Georgia, which induced government to assign the defence of the southern frontier to general Piuekney. Congress had not been long in session, when the public feelings were once more excited by the news of another"], [243, "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 227 naval victory. This was the capture of the British frigate Java, of 46 guns, by the Constitution, of 50 guns, com- modore Baiubridjre. The action took place on the 29th of December, 1812, off the coast of South America, and was fought with the most determined valpur. The Java had twenty-two men killed, and 102 wounded; among the former was the gallant captain Lambert. The Consti- tuiion had nine men killed, and twenty-five wounded. On the day after the eugagemept, she prize was found in such a state as to render it impossible to bring her in, she was therefore blown up, with every thing on board, except the prisoners baggage. ln the midst of these affairs, news of fresh disasters to the westward, accompanied by most afflicting circumstan- ces, tended effectually to damp the public joy for the second victory of the Constitution. General Harrison whose object was the re-capture of Detroit, had fixed his head quarters at Franklinton, in the state of Ohio ; niean- while general Winchester continued at sort Defiance, with about 8Q0 volunteers, belonging to \u25a0 the first families in Kentucky. The inhabitants of Frenc.hi.own, twenty-six miles from Detroit, fearing a visit from the British and Indians, particularly the latter, had solicited general Win- chester for assistance. Accordingly, on the 17th of January, 1813, he detached a body of men, under colonels Lewis and Allen, for their protection. On arriving at Presque Isle, they learned that tbe enemy's advance had taken possession of Frenchtown ; they immediately resolv- ed to nifirch forward and drive them out; this they effected, with the loss of twelve killed and fifty-five wounded. On the 20th, they were joined by general Winchester, and with this addition, the whole force amounted to 750 men. On the morning of the 22d, they were attacked by the British under colonel Proctor, and a large body of In- dians, commanded by the chiefs Round-head and Split- log. After a most sanguinary conflict of six hours, during which their loss in killed and wounded amounted to above 300, thirty-five officers and 500 men were obliged to sur- render prisoners of war. The loss ofthe British was twenty- four filled, and 158 wounded. Scarcely had the Americans surrendered, when the ferocious Indians commenced butchering them in cold blood, in defiance of the entrea ties of the British officers ; many of whom exerted them selves in behalf of the unfortunate prisoners. The remains of this ill-fated little army was to have been matvhed to Maiden, but small was the number that ever reached the British fort. The greater part of them had been carried 2Q"], [244, "228 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. off by the Indians, either to satiate their vengeance, or to gratify their avarice, by exposing them to sale. Many of the inhabitants of Detroit parted with every thing they possessed of value in purchasing the captives from the savages. But the afflicting tale is not yet told. About sixty ofthe wounded, many of them persons of distinction, and officers of respectability, had been permitted to take shelter with the people of Frenchtown. On the next day, a party of Indians returned, fell upon these wounded men, plundered them of every article of value, tomohawk ed the greater part of them, and to finish the scene, fired the houses, and consumed the dying and the dead ! Among those who underwent this species of suffering were Mr. Simpson, a member of congress, colonel Allen, majors Madison, and Ballard, captains Hart, Hickman, Wool folk, Bledsoe, Matson, Hamilton, Williams, Kelly, M'Cracken, &c. &c. Excepting some parties on excursions, nothing addi tional transpired during the severe winter months. Gene ral Harrison had established his head-quarters at the Rapids of the Miami, where he had constructed sort Meigs. The British general, Proctor, had been for some time making preparations to attack this place, and at the end of April had collected a force for that purpose, consisting of 922 regulars and militia, exclusive of officers, and 1,200 Indians, commanded by the intrepid Teeumsech. On the first of May the siege commenced'^ and on the third, an additional battery was opened within 250 yards. The fort was now summoned to surrender, ancl an answer returned by general Harrison, that he would never submit to any force of which Indians composed a part. The siege was renewed with great vigour, and the firing hotly kept up ou both sides ; especially by the Indians, who did much execution by firing from trees in the neighbourhood, upon which they had mounted in great numbers. A reinforce ment to the garrison was now advancing under general Clay, who, by directions from the commander in chief, detached 800 men, under colonel Dudley, to attaek the enemy's batteries on the opposite side of the river ; while at the same time, a sortie from the fort should be made against the besiegers. Dudley's detachment succeeded in carrying: the batteries, but were shortly after attacked by a lar_e body of Indians, commanded by Teeumsech, who killed, wonnded, and took prisoners the whole party, except 150 meu: among the slain was colonel Dudley. The sortie, under colonel Miller, succeeded in spiking the cannon, and- taking forty-"], [245, "229 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. two prisoners; but lost a great number of men in the action : the British had only fourteen killed and forty seven wounded. During the three following days, a ces sation of hostilities took place, and an exchange of pri soners was agreed upon ; and ou the 9th, at ten o'clock at night, thc enemy raised the siege, and moved off with his whole force, in the course of the different attacks, the British and Indians captured 945 prisoners: the loss twthin the fort, was eighty-oue killed, and 189 wounded. After the siege of fort Meigs, offensive operations were for a considerable time suspended on both sides. We now return to the northern frontier, operations of an interest ing nature having taken place in that quarter since the winter. Excepting some partisan affairs, nothing of consequence transpired duriug the severest months of the winter sea- son ; but early iu February, major Forsythe crossed the St. Lawrence, surprised tlie guard at Elizabeth-town in Upper Canada, took fifty-two prisoners, including six commissioned officers, and captured 120 firelocks, some casks of ammunition, and other public property. He then returned, without the loss of a siugle man. In retaliation for this agression, on the 22d ofthe same month, a British force of 480 regulars and militia^ under lieutenant-colonel Macdonnell, passed the St. Lawrence on the ice, attacked and carried the town and fort of Ogdensburgh, making prisoners four officers and seventy privates, and capturing eleven pieces of cannon, with all the ordnance and other stores; besides burning two armed schooners, two large gun-boats, and the soldiers barracks. The next expedition undertaken, was an attack upon York, the capital of Upper Cauada. This took place on the 27th of April, by a body of troops from Sacket's-har- hour, under the immediate command of brigadier-general Pike, a young officer of great merit ; but the whole direct- ed by general Dearborue, the commander in chief Com- modore Chauncey, who now commanded a fleet of sixteen sail upon lake Ontario, conveyed the troops to their place of destination, which they reached at two o'clock in the morning, and at ten the debarkation was completed; though warmly opposed by a body of Indians uuder an English officer. The American riflemen first landed, and were received by a shower of musketry ; they however push ed forward, and were immediately followed by several divi sions of their friends. The whole ofthe troops having made good a landing, general Pike placed himself at their head, when a severe engagement ensued, in which the British, con-"], [246, "230 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. sisting of about 600 regulars and militia, besides Indians, made a desperate defence, being often broken and as often rallied. At length, after a conflict of nearly eight hours, the town was surrendered, and the troops, naval officers and seamen, made prisoners of war : all the public stores were given up, but private property was guaranteed to the citizens. At the close ofthe action, an unfortunate occur rence took place ; but whether by accident or design has never yet been determined. A magazine belonging to oi.e of the batteries blew up, killing and wounding above 200 ofthe Americans, and about forty of the British ; general Pike was mortally wounded. The number of prisoners taken amounted to 294, including forty-three commission ed officers; ancl the loss ofthe British, in action, was sixty two killed, and thirty-four wounded. The Americans, including those destroyed by the explosion, had above 300 men killed and wounded. The next attempt was sgain.t fort George and fort Erie, which had been unsuccessfully attacked tbe year before. Preparations for this expedition had been for some time in progress, and a few troops having crossed the river, had formed an encampment at Four-mile-creek; so called from being four miles distant from the river Niagara. On the 27th of May, at day break, generals Dearborne and Lewis, with 4,000 men, embarked under protection of commodore Cbauncey's squadron. The British batteries immediately opened, as the troops approached in three brigades ; the advance, however; under colonel Scott, reached the shore, and landed. They were instantly sup ported by the second and third divisions, which formed rapidly, and rushed forward to the attack. In the mean time, fort Niagara, and the batteries on the American side, were keeping up tin incessant fire. The British made a galiant resistance, but finding fort George unten able, they laid trains to their magazines, and evacuated the place. The loss of the Americans on this occasion, was thirty-nine killed, and 108 wounded. The number killed ofthe enemy was never ascertained ; but 160 wound* ed, and above 600 prisoners were taken. The joy arising from this victory was but of short dura tion. The British who had retreated from the Niagara, were again assembled under brigadier-general Vincent, near the head of lake Ontario ; having been reinforced by 1,800 troops from Chippewa, fort Erie, and Kingston. A much superior force, under the command of general Lewis; had been ordered to cut off their retreat ; which was deemed quite practicable, Chauncey having the command of the"], [247, "231 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. l\u00ab5ke. Lewis having taken possession ofthe posts between sorts George and Erie, the latter was furiously attacked ; but the British had previously blown up the magazine. Having received intelligence that general Vincent was encamped at Burlington-heights, they pursued on to Stoney-creek. and encamped within about seven miles of the enemy. Here, on the 6th of June, in the middle of the night, their advance were completely surprised and defeated by a detachment from the British camp, who took prisoners two brigadier-generals, one major, three captains, and 100 men, and captured four field-pieces and three tumbrils. The loss of the British in this spirited affair, was twenty-three killed, 135 Wounded, and fifty five missing. This daring party afterwards made good their retreat, knowing the enemy to be still powerful, and to possess sour or five piec.sof artillery; The Americans then fell back on Four-mile-Creekj where they received orders to return to sort George. Having put the greater part of the camp equipage aud baggage into boats, they were iutercepted by an armed schooner, and twelve of them captured ; while the army, during the whole of their march, was harassed by the Indians hanging upon its flanks and rear. The movement of general DearbOrne against the ene my's fortifications on the Niagara, had nearly cost him dear. The British having obtained information of it, re solved upon attacking Sacket's-harbour ; well knowing that it was a grand dep6t of naval and military stores, with a view to further operations against Canada. On the night of the 27th of May, a detachment of 1 ;000 men, under colonel Baynes, appeared off the harbour, supported by the fleet under sir James Yeo : the place was defended by about an equal number of troops. The next morning a fleet of Ameri can barges was observed coming round North-point, with a reinforcement from Oswego ; the attention of the British was sor some time occupied by these, and they succeeded in cutting off twelve of the boats. Preparations were now made to land, which was effected with little resistance ; For a sudden panic having seized the American militia, they fled in confusion, leaving their colonel mortally wounded. The enemy now advanced rapidly to the bar racks, where they met with a more spirited resistance from the regulars and artillery; and the militia having been rallied and brought back, the British commander was finally obliged to abandon the enterprise, and order a re treat ; leaving all his wounded and a number of prisoners. The loss of the Americans was one colonel, apd twenty-"], [248, "232 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. three men killed ; one lieutenant-colonel, three lieutenants, one ensign, and seventy-nine men wounded ; and twenty- six missing. The British had one general staff,* three sergeants, forty-four rank and file killed ; three majors, three captains, five lieutenants, one ensign, seven ser- geants, two drummers, 172 rank aud file wounded ; two captains, one ensign, thirteen rank and file missing. About this time an affair of considerable moment took place near fort George, in which the American arms ex- perienced a severe reverse. A detachment under colonel Boerstler, consisting of 540 men, including twenty-two officers, had been ordered to dislodge a party ofthe enemy about seventeen miles distant; On their march they were surrounded by a large body of Indians, accompanied by some British troops, with whom they contended until one- third of their number was slain ; when the rest were obliged to oapitulate, under the same stipulations as those of gene- ral Winchester, at Frenchtown. During the succeeding months, a mere war of posts was kept up between the twa armies. Genera! Dearbornfe, whose increasing indisposition dis qualified him for an active command, had retired from the service, leaving colonel Boyd, his successsor, in fort George. On the 8th of J uly, a severe skirmish took place, in which nearly the whole foroe on each side was engaged, without auy thing \u00a9f moment resulting frOm it: one unfor tunate event renders it remarkable. Lieutenant Eldridge, an accomplished youth, with about thirty men, was sur rounded by Indians ; they resisted until they were nearly all killed : but tin? lieutenant himself, and ten others, were taken prisoners, and never afterwards heard of. The bodies ofthe slain were treated in the most shocking man ner ; their hearts being cut out aud actually eaten by the savages! After this melancholy transaction, the Ameri can general engaged the services of 400 warriors of the Seneca Indians, commanded by two of their chiefs, one of whom had been educated in a college of the United States, but on his return home had resumed the tomo hawk. \u2022 This valuable officer, and accomplished gentleinan, was captain Gray, acting deputy quartermaster-general. He was mortally wounded by a small boy, a drum mer, who snatched up a musket and fired it at him, iis he was gallantly advancing Rt the head df a column to storm the barracks. This boy, who was an American, bad been his servant, und on tbe war breaking out, had\" returned home. On disco\" veripg who'he had wounded, he ran lo his former master, and burst into an agony of grief. Captain Gray generously forgave him ; and with a nobleness of soul, of which we have too few examples, took out bis watch arid presented it to him, with these words, \" My brave little fellow you have done well.\" Whether the bov Reserved 6is encomium or his curse, is a matter to ba settled by the casuists."], [249, "233 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. On the 11th, a British force of 220 men crossed the Niagara and attacked Black-rock. The militia stationed there having fled, as was usual, the enemy succeeded in burning the barracks, ship-yard, and block-houses; they also captured and destroyed some cannon and warlike stores. But a considerable force of regulars and Indians having been collected, the British were obliged to retreat to their boats, before the stores were completely destroyed, leaving thirteen killed and twenty-five wounded ; among the latter was colonel Bisshopp, who commanded the party. On the 28th, a second expedition was undertaken against York. Colonel Scott, with 300 men, embarked in commodore Chauncey's fleet, and suddenly landing at that place, surprised the enemy, destroyed a part of the public stores and property, released a number of colonel Boerstler's men, and returned to Sacket's -harbour with a trifling loss. Both the British and Americans had now established a small naval force upon lake Champlain ; but that of tho latter was by much the least prosperous. In the beginning of July, two fine schooners, the Growler and Eagle, were captured by the British, who then became masters of the lake, cruised along its borders, and\" landing at Champlain town, and other places, destroyed several block-houses and much public property. On lake Ontario, a formidable naval armament was arrayed on either side, and an inter esting eontest ensued between two skilful naval officers, sir James Yeo and commodore Chauncey, for the supe riority ; being nearly upon an equality in point of force. On the 7th of August, they came in sight of each other, when a scene of grand man\u0153uvring took place, which continued throughout the day ; but in the evening the wind blew a gale, and at eleven o'clock at night, two of the American schooners upset in a squall, by which the whole of the crews, consisting of more than 1.00 men, were drowned, except sixteen. Partial actions took place between the fleets until the 10th, when sir James suc ceeded in cutting off two of the enemy's schooners, which he carried safe into port. War on the coast, maritime transactions, affairs ofthe west, &c\u2014 It was now understood, that the system of warfare which was meant to be carried on in the spring against the Atlantic coast, would be a system of severity ; but to what extent was not known. On the 4th of February, 1814, a squadron, consisting of two. ships of"], [250, "234 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. the line, three frigates, and other vessels, made its appear ance in the Chesapeak. The alarm was instantly caught at Norfolk, in Virginia, aud the militia called in from the upper part of the state. No attempt, however, was made upon the town, the enemy contenting himself by destroy ing the smaller vessels, and blockading the waters of the bay. About the same time, another squadron, under commodore Beresford, arrived in the Delaware ; which in the same manner destroyed a number of small trading vessels, and attempted to land some men, but were re pulsed by the militia. On the 10th of April, the commo dore made a demand on the village of Lewistown, for a supply of provisions, which was refused. The Belvidera frigate was then ordered to bombard the place ; but after a cannonade of twenty-four hours, little or no damage was done: the fire had been returned from several bat teries, hastily thrown up on the bank, with considerably effect. The same squadron, on the 10th of May, having sent out boats to procure water in the neighbourhood of Lewistown, a detachment of 15.0 militia, under major Hunter, opposed their landing, and compelled them to return to their shipping. These ships soon after returned to Bermuda, where a more considerable armament, for the annoyance of the American sea-coast, was then sitting out. Not long after the departure of the squadron, the Spartan, and some other frigates, entered the Delaware; and on the 29th of July, one of their vessels, the Martin sloop of war, was discovered to be slightly grounded. A detachment ofthe gun-boat flotilla immediately moved, and anchored about three quarters of a mile from the sloop, opened a destructive fire upon her. The Juno frigate came to her assistance, and a cannonade was kept up during an hour, between the gun-boats and these two ships ; who at length manned all their boats, and suc ceeded in cutting off No. 121 gun-boat from the rest of this musqueto fleet. The Martin having been extricated from her situation, the British soon after made sail. Scenes ofa different kind were in the meanwhile actjng in the Chesapeak. The squadron, which returned in February, still continued to carry on a severe warfare along the shores and inlets, upon the property of the inhabitants. The citizens of Maryland formed bodies of cavalry, which were stationed at intervals along the shore, for the purpose of repelling the inroads of the enemy ; who had now taken possession of several islands in the bay, whence descents could readily be made upon"], [251, "UNITED STATES OK AMERICA. 235 the neighbouring shores, when the inhabitants happened to be off their guard. The next attack was upou French town, a village about half-way between Philadelphia and Baltimore, aud a place of deposit on the line of packets and stages. A number of marines landed from the Marl borough seventy-four, and after destroying the store houses, together with the goods they were unable to carry off, to an immense amount, they retreated to their boats in safety : the militia, who were drawn up to oppose their landing, having fled at their approach. On the 3d of May, a descent was made at Havre-de- Grace, a post town and port of entry near the head of Chesapeak-bay. The inhabitants were surprised in their beds, by the firing of rockets ; and the more courageous part of them ran to the beach, were a few small cannon had been planted for defence. After supporting a fire for some time, on the approach of the barges they all fled, except an old citizen ofthe town, named O'Neill, a native of Ireland. This man alone continued the fight, loading a piece of artillery, and firing it himself, until by r.coil jng, it ran over his thigh and wounded him severely. He then armed himself with a musket, ancl still continued to fire on the boats as they advanced ; but finding his single exertions of no avail, he retreated, wounded, to his com rades, whom he in vain attempted to rally. The enemy now landed, burned the houses, and destroyed much pro perty; an elegant house belonging to commodore Rodgers, was spared by au order from admiral Cockburn, who com manded the British ships in the Chesapeak. After the town was destroyed, the invaders divided into three par ties, and while one remained as a guard, the other two proceeded to the country, levying contributions on the farmers, from whom they carried off much valuable pro perty. On the 6th, they returned to their fleet, and liberated O'Neill, who had been for two days a prisoner. The next attack was upon two handsome villages, called Georgetown and Fredericktown, situated upon the river Sassafras, which flows into Chesapeak-bay. At the latter town, colonel Veazy had collected about fifty militia, who, according to their custom, fled on the approach of the barges, which kept up a heavy fire of cannon and musket ry. Both these villages were burnt, and a large quantity of spoil carried off. Soon after this, admiral Warren en tered the bay, with a 'considerable reinforcement, and a number of land troops and marines. The whole British force now in the Chesapeak, consisted of seven ships of the line, and twelve frigates, with a proportionate numb.r _ H"], [252, "236 UNITED STATES OF A.MERICA. of smaller vessels. On the 18th of May, a squadron of the enemy appeared in Hampton-roads, about twenty miles from Norfolk in Virginia, where a serious attack was apprehended. The Constellation frigate was anchored between the two forts on each side of Elizabeth-river, which commands the approach to Norfolk ; and at this place nearly 10,000 ofthe Virgiuiau militia had been col lected. On the 20th, an action took place between the gun-boat flotilla and some British frigates, which ended in the retreat ofthe gun-boats. A formidable attempt on Norfolk being now determined upon, on the morning ofthe 22d, the enemy's ships, with between three aud 4,000 men, appeared in Elizabeth-river. When within about 200 yards of the shore, a severe and galling fire was opened upon them from Crany island, which commands the river, by which some of their boats were cut in two, and the admiral's barge, the Centipede, entirely sunk. At the same time, a body of troops which had landed on the main shore, were attacked by a superior number of Virginia volunteers. Every pass being thus guarded and strongly defended by cannon and musketry, the British commander ordered a retreat, without accom- plishing the origiual design. The safety of the city of Norfolk, and ofthe surrounding towns of Gosport, Ports mouth, and others, is to be solely attributed to the success ful defence of Crany island. The aext object of attack was Hampton, about eighteen miles distant from Norfolk. On the 25th, admiral Cock burn advanced towards the towu, in a number of barges, tenders, and smaller vessels, throwing- rockets, and firiag ; while general Beckwith tended below, at the head of 2,000 men. The place was defended by about 500 meD, infantry and artillery ; who opposed the enemy for a con siderable time, with some appearance of success, but were finally defeated, and the town taken possession of by tha British. The loss of the Americans on this occasion was seven killed and twelve wounded ; that ofthe British, five killed, and thirty-three wounded. After the capture of this place, many excesses were said to have beeis commit ted by the conquerors ; who defended themselves by ur_iug she law of retaliation, and charging the Americans with having fired upon the seamen who clung to the bot tom ofa barge destroyed at Crany isiaud. The squadron, durir.g the remainder of the summer, often threatened the city of Washington, Annapolis, and Baltimore ; in cousequence of which large bodies of militia were drawn out, and the country much harassed. Admi-"], [253, "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 237 ral Cockburn had moved to the southward, with a for midable force, to carry on the same species of warfare which had been so successful iu the Chesapeak. In the beginning of July, he captured two private armed vessels in Pamlico-sound, North Carolina, but was frustrated in his attempt upon Newborn, by the sudden assembling ofa large body of militia. He then proceeded to Portsmouth, chiefly inhabited by fishermen, which was also captured, and some property, including slaves, carried off. To the north ofthe Chesapeak, where the British naval force was commanded by commodore Hardy, no private property was seized ; yet the coast was not exempt from the effects of war. A strict blockade was preserved at New York, and two American frigates and a sloop of war, kept in port from the lst of .May till the lst of June, when attempting to escape, they were chased into New London. By taking out some of their guns, they were enabled to ascend the river out of the reach of the enemy, and the place being well fortified, no attempt was made upon it ; but the blockade was strictly kept up for many months. An act of congress had been passed dnring the last win ter, which cannot be mentioned without feelings of detes tation. A reward of half the vessel destroyed, was offered to such as should effect the destruction, by any other means than the armed vessels ofthe United States.* Seve ral attempts at blowing up the enemy's vessels were made in consequence of this law. The most remarkable were those against the Ramilies, the admiral's ship, the other against the Plantagenet. The first was on the 25th of June, and was attempted by filling a schooner with barrels of flour, and a quantity of gunpowder concealed; having a gun-lock fixed at the bottom, so contrived as to explode the powder in the act of unloading. The schooner was then thrown in the way ofthe enemy, who captured her : but fortunately, instead of taking her along-side the Ramilies, they determined first to take out some of the cargo. In doing this, the vessel blew up, and destroyed several ofthe British seamen. The next was the experiment with the torpedo, against the Plantagenet, then lying below Norfolk. After sour or five attempts, this murderous machine was dropped within 100 yards of the ship, and swept down by the tide. On * A law somewhat similar was formerly passed hy the French eoaveBtKxa ; namely, to give no quarter to the British who might he taken in an engagement, but to spare \"all others in similar circumstances. This bloody decree tell to the ground ; as the French soldiers, with that magnanimous spirit wl___ characterise* the military of all civilized countries, refused to put it ia execution."], [254, "238 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. approaching the bottom of the vessel, it exploded in tliP most awful manner, and an immense column of water was thrown up, which fell with powerful weight on the deck ; at the same time, a vast yawning gulf was opened, in which she appeared about to be swallowed up ; though fortunately the ship was not greatly injured. Commodore Hardy was iustly indignant at this Cowardly attempt, and protested \"so strongly against it, that tbe torpedo system was not afterwards put in practice. Nothing, indeed, can justify such a mode of warfare ; it Would be wrong fo practise it even against an unsparing foe : it is little better than poisoning fountains and preparing mines. There is some thing unmanly in this insiduous mode of annoyance; valour can claim no share in such exploits, for to the brave mind little pleasure can be derived from the recollection of having- thus treacherously destroyed an enemy. The laurel which is not fairly won* is of no value to the real hero. It is now time to return to the affairs ofthe navy ; seve ral conflicts by sea, with various success, having occurred since the engagement between the Constitution and Java, in December, 1812. Congress had now become so sensible, of the importance of their marine, that during the last session they had authorised the building of several addi tional vessels, and it was resolved to augment the navy by annual grants for that purpose. This was certainly wise policy ; for though a free people have just cause to dread a standing army, there ean be no reason to distrust a naval force. After commodore Bainbridge, in the Constitution, had left the coast of Brazil, on the 6th of January, 181.1^ the Hornet sloop of war, captain Lawrence, remained off St. Salvador, until the 24th, blockading the British sloop Bonne Citoyenne, which having a large quantity of specie on board, declined coming out to risk an engagement. But the Montague, seventy-sour, having; appeared in sight, the Hornet ran info the harbour, where she remain ed until evening, and then put to sea, shaping: her course to Pernambuco. On the 4th of February, she captured the English brig Resolution of ten guns, with 2,_,000 dol lars in specie ; and afterwards running down the coast of Maranam, from thence stood for Demarara, when, on the 24th, she fell in with the Peacock sloop of war, captain Peake. After a severe action of fifteen minutes, the Pea cock surrendered, being so much damaged that she could scarcely be kept afloat until the prisoners could be remov ed ; she then sunk, carrying down with her nine of her own crew and three belonging to the Hornet. The gallant"], [255, "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 239 Captain Peake and four of his men were sound dead on board, and twenty-nine seamen wounded. The losses the Hornet was one man killed, and four wounded. A few days after the arrival ofthe Hornet, captain Lawrence Was appointed to the command of the Chesapeak frigate, then lying at Boston; On the lst of June, discovering that the British frigate, the Shannon, captain Broke, had appeared off the har bour, displaying- her colours, captain Lawrence imme diately summoned all the officers on board, and got the ship under way. The Shannon proceeded down the bay in fine style, the Chesapeak following under a press of sail, with a flag flying at each mast head. In a short time, spectators were collected on every hill and place in and about Boston-, which commanded a view of the sea ; but the frigates proceeded to the eastward, fill lost sight of from the town, and the people on shore were thereby Spared the distress of witnessing the result. At half-past five o'clock, the action commenced, and after exchanging two or three broadsides, the Chesapeak fell on board the Shannon. Captain Broke gave immediate orders for boarding, and in fifteen minutes the enemy's ship was cap tured ; having lost, forty-seven killed, and ninety-nine Wouuded, of whom fourteen afterwards died. Amongthe former were the sailing master, 4th lieutenant, lst lieu tenant of marines, and a midshipman. Among the latter, captain Lawrence, and the 2d lieutenant, (both mortally,) two other lieutenants, and the chaplain. The loss on board the Shannon Was twenty-three slain, and fifty-six wounded: the lst lieutenant, purser, and captains' clerk, were among the killed ; captain Broke and one midship man among the wounded. On the arrival of the ships at Halifax, tbe bodies of captain Lawrence and lieutenant Ludlow were interred with every honour, civil, naval, and military, which the British could bestow. The re mains of these gallant officers were afterwards carried to the United States. The tide of fortune continued in favour of Great Britain. On the 14th of August, the United States sloop of war, Argus, captain .Mien, when cruising in St. George's chan nel, fell in with the British sloop of war, Pelican, captain Maples ; when an action commenced at the distance of musket shot, the Pelican having the weather gage. At the first broadside captain Allen fell, mortally wounded ; and after a severe engagement of two hours, in which the Argus had all her rigging cut to pieces, the ship quite unmanageable, and having had six men killed, and seven-"], [256, "240 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. teen wounded, she struck her colours. The Pelican had three killed, and five wounded. Captain Allen died of his wounds in England, and, with two of his midshipmen was interred with military honours at Plymouth. Early in July, letters were received from captain Por- ter, who had been uncommonly successful in making cap- tures in the South seas< He had actually created a fleet of nine sail, by means of prize vessels, eight of which had been letters-of-marque. Among other vessels captured by him, were two sine British ships, pierced for twenty guns, but carrying only sixteen between them, and fifty-five men, one of these had on board Ho less than 500,000 dol- lars. But the next naval engagement that deserves notice, after that between the Argus and Pelican, occurred on the 6th of September. The United States brig, Enterprise, lieutenant Burrows, sailed from Portsmouth, New Hamp- shire, on the 1st, and after having been out four days, fell in with the British brig, Boxer, captain Blythe, Which im- mediately bore clown on the eneniy, with several flags fly- ing. Firing commenced on both sides within pistol shot, and continued for fifteen minutes, when the Boxer surren- dered, hailing: her antagonist that she had yielded, but the colours could not be hauled down, being nailed to the mast. The Enterprise had one man killed, and thirteen wounded ; the Boxer twenty killed and fourteen wounded. Lieutenant Burrows died ofhiswounds, aud captain Blythe was killed in action. On the arrival ofthe ships at Port- land, the bodies ofthe commanders were interred with mi- litary honours. Except Ihe important transactions on lake Erie, an account of which will be afterwards given, no naval affair of moment occurred during the remainder of this year. We shall therefore revert to tbe operations in the west, where some interesting events had already taken place. In the midst of the various occurrences of the war, on the northern frontier, on the sea-coast, and ou the ocean, great preparations were making to the westward ; and al- though the spring and the summer had passed away, with- out any incident in this quarter worthy of being recorded, they had not passed inactive. The geueral attention was now turned towards it with much anxiety, and the armies of the Niagara and St. Lawrence remained, almost with folded arms, awaiting the issue of general Harrison's cam- paign, and the result ofthe contest for the mastership of lake Erie. Upon the issue of that naval conflict great events depended. The British reinforcements continually arriving at sort George, were evidently destined to follow"], [257, "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 241 up the advantages which general Proctor might gain, in conjunction with their commander on the lake. In the mean while, in the neighbouring states of Ohio and Ken tucky, the people were excited in a most surprising de gree ; and had it been necessary, they would have risen en masse ; almost every man capable of bearing a musket, was anxious to march. The governor of Ohio had scarcely issued his proclamation, calling on volunteers to arm in defence of their country, than 15,000 men presented them selves, fully equipped ; beiug more than three times the number required. The venerable governor of Kentucky, Shelby, an officer in the revolutionary war, made it known that he would place himself at the head of the citizens of that state, and lead them to seek revenge for the massacre of their relatives and friends, at Frenchtown ; but limited the number of volunteers to 4,000. The campaign opened by an attack upon Sandusky, on lake Erie, which was defended by colonel Croghan, a youth of twenty-oue years osage. His force amounted to about 160 men, regulars, and volunteers from Pitts burgh, with only one six-pounder. General Harrison, not believing that the place could be defended, ordered Croghan to retire on the approach of the enemy, after destroying what few works were erected. This the colo nel, taking the responsibility upon himself, determined to disobey. On the lst of August, general Proctor, having left a large body of Indians under Teeumsech, to keep up the appearance of a siege against fort Meigs, arrived at Sandusky with about 400 British, 3,000 Indians, and some gun-boats. After the general had disposed his troops so as to cat off the retreat of the garrison, he sent a flag by colonel Elliot, demanding a surrender. A spirited answer was returned by Croghan, who found that all his compa nions, chiefly youths like himself, would support him to the last extremity. When the flag returned, a brisk fire was opened from the gun-boats and howitzer, which continued during the night: in the morning three sixes began to play, within 250 yards ofthe pickets. At four o'clock in the afternoon, a breach was attempted at the north-west angle, by bringing all the artillery to bear against it ; but it was instantly strengthen ed by bags of flour and sand ; and a six-pounder, loaded with slugs and grape, was concealed in the bastion which commanded the point to be assailed. A large body ofthe enemy now advanced in close column, to storm the place supposed to be injured, and lieut. -colonel Short, their commander, gallantly leaped into the ditch, calling upon"], [258, "242 UNITED STATES OF A.MERICA. the rest to follow. The fatal six-pounder now opened a most destructive fire, killing aud wounding the greater part, and among the first, colonel Short and lieutenant Gordon : a heavy discharge of musketry was also kept up upon the troops in rear of the advance. The assailants were now drawn off, and returned to Sandwich ; having lost, according to their own return, twenty-five killed., the same number missing, and forty wounded. But the American account says, that the British had at least 200 killed and wounded, and that more than fifty were found in the ditch ; while the loss of the garrison was only one killed, and seven wounded. Upon these contradictory statements the reader is left to decide. \u2014 Soon after this; Teeumsech raised the siege of fort Meigs, and followed general Proctor to Detroit. The utmost exertions had been made in the mean time by commodore Perry, to complete the naval armament on lake Erie. His fleet consisted of two brigs of 20 guns each, one of 3, one schooner of 4, two of 2 each, aud tliree sloops of 1 gun each ; total, 54 guns. The British force, under captain Barclay, consisted of two ships, one of 19, the other of 17 guns ; one schooner of 13, one brig of 8, one sloop of 3, and another carrying 1 gun ; total, 61 guns. On the morning of the 10th of September, the British ships was seen bearing down upon the American squadron, then at anchor in Put-in-bay. Perry imme diately weighed, and went out to meet them ; and the line of battle was formed at eleven o'clock, the Americans having the weather gage. At a quarter before twelve, the action was commenced by captain Barclay, in the Detroit, attacking the Lawrence, commodore Perry's ship, which she sustained for ten minutes, before she could approach near enough for her carronades to do execution. She therefore bore up, making signals for the other vessels to hasten to her support, and about twelve opened her fire upon the enemy. But the wind being too light, the other vessels eould not get up to assist her, and she was therefore obliged to contend for two hours with two antagonists, until she became a mere wreck, altogether unmanageable. At this time commodore Perry having determined to shift his flag, leaped into a boat, aud passed unhurt to the Niagara, of 20 guns, which he had no sooner reached, than the Lawrence struck her colours; but none ofthe British vessels vvere in a condition to take possession of her. The scale now turned in favour of Perry, and the contest raged sor some time with great violence, until the British ship Queen Charlotte, having lost her captain and"], [259, "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 243 all the principal officers, by some mischance ran foul of the Detroit and most of the guns of both vessels became useless, i hey were now compelled to sustain an incessant fire from the Niagara, and the other vessels of the Ameri- can squadron, which came to her support. The flag of captain Barclay was soon after struck, aud the colours of the Queen Charlotte, and of all the other vessels, followed in succession, after a severe and bloody conflict of three hours. The loss of the Americans was twenty-seven kil- led, and ninety-six wounded, among the former, one lieutenant of marines, and one midshipman; among the latter, one lieutenant, one master, one purser, and two midshipmen. The British loss was three officers and thirty-eight men killed, aid nine officers and eighty-five men wounded ; among the latter, the gallant captain Barclay, dangerously: captain Finnis, of the Queen Charlotte, was killed. The Americans were now masters of lake Erie ; but their territory was still in the possession of general Proc- tor. The next movement was against the British and Indians at Detroit, and at Maiden. Four thousand Kentuckians, with the governor at their head, arrived at general Harrison's camp ; and with the co-operation ofthe fleet, it was determined to proceed at once to Maiden, while colonel Johnson was ordered to proceed to Detroit. On the 27th, the troops were received on board, and on the same day reached a point below Maiden ; which had been evacuated by the British general, Proctor, who, with the Indians under Teeumsech, had retreated along the river Thames. On the 2d of October, the Americans marched with 3,500 men in pursuit of general Procter, and the first day proceeded twenty-six miles. On the 4th, they were detained by an attack from a large body of Indians, who were dispersed, and 2,000 stand of arms captured: the day following they reached the place where the enemy had encamped. Colonel Johnson went forward fo recon- noitre, and found the British drawn up in battle array; their right wing consisting of the Indians, under Teeum- sech, who were posted in a swamp. The Americans were formed in two lines, with cavalry in the front opposed to the savages. Upon the left, the action was begun by Teeumsech with great fury; and colonel Johnson, who commanded on that flank, received a galling fire. The combat now raged with unusual violence; the Indians, to the amount of 1,300, seemed determined to maintain their ground to the last ; and the terrible voice of Teeumsech could be dis- xo. xi. 2 i"], [260, "844 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. tinctly heard, encouraging his warriors, who fought round their gallant chief with determined courage. An incident soon occurred which decided the contest. Colonel Johnson rushed forward towards the spot, where the the Indians, clustering about their undaunted leader, con tending wtith the utmost fury, and found himself in the midst of them, while a hundred rifles were aimed at him. The colonel, being mounted on an elegant white horse, was a very conspicuous object ; and his holsters, clothes, aud accoutrements were pierced with bullets ; himself having received five wounds, and his horse nine. At the instant his horse was about to sink under him, the daring Kentuckian, covered with blood from his wounds, was discovered by Teeumsech, The heroic chief, having dis-. charged his rifle, sprang forward with his tomohawk ; but struck with the appearance of his brave antagonist, and somewhat startled by the determined glance of his eye, hesitated sor a moment, and that moment was his last. The colonel levelled a pistol at his breast, and they both, aN most at the same instant, fell to the ground \u2014 Teeumsech to rise no more.* The Kentucky volunteers rushed for ward to the rescue of their leader, while the Indian chiefs and warriors, surrounding the body of their great chief. tian, fought with the utmost desperation ; but no longer stimulated by his animating voice and example, soon after fled in confusion. Near the spot where this scene occurs red, thirty Indians were found dead, and six of their oppo nents. In this engagement, the British loss was ninety killed, and 150 wounded ; the Indians left 120 on the field. The American loss, in killed and wounded, amounted to upwards of fifty. After the action, general Proctor re treated along the river Thames, leaving several pieces of brass cannon, and his travelling carriage, containing all his private papers. The Indian chiefs now came forward * Thus fell, about the fortieth year of his age, Teeumsech, the most celebrated Indian warrior that ever raised the tomohawk apainst white men; and with him fell the hopas of (he Indians attached to the British army. But he. fell respected by his enemies, as a great and magnanimous chief : lor though he never took prisoners in battle, he treated with humanity those that had been taken by others; and at the defeat of colonel Dudley, in attempting to relieve fort Meigs, actually put to death a chief whom he found engaged in the work of massacre. He was endowed with a powerful mind, and possessed the soul of a hero; had an uncom mon dignity in his countenance and manners, by which marks he could be easily distinguished, even after death, from ihe rest of the slain ; tor he wore no mark of distinction. When girded with a silk sash, and told by general Proctor that hi wan made a brigadier in the Brili-h service, lie relumed the present with respeet fid contempt. Bum with no title to command but his native greatness, every tribe yielded submission to him at once ; and no one ever disputed his authority. His form was uncommonly elegant, hit stature about six feet, and his limbs perfeotlj\" proportioned."], [261, "245 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. _nd sued for peace, which was granted them, on condition of declaring against their former friends, which they im mediately did, and were supported at the expence of the American government during the ensuing winter. The Indian war in this quarter being now at an end, and the frontier secured, the greater part of the volunteers were permitted to return home; and general Harrison, after stationing general Cass at Detroit, with about 1,000 men, proceeded, with the remainder of his force, to join the army ofthe centre at Buffalo, on lake Erie. Another attempt on Canada, meeting of congress, northern coast invaded, &c. \u2014 The successful operatioos of the north-western army, and the victory on lake Erie, bad opened the way to a more effectual invasion of Canada. The season was already far advanced, yet much might be done ; but perhaps to satisfy the public expect ation to the extent it had been raised by the success of general Harrison, was scarcely possible. After the resig nation of general Dearborne, general Wilkinson, who commanded in the south, was called to the command of the northern army. The force under his orders, on the Niagara, amounted to 8,000 regulars, besides those under Harrison, which were expected in October. General Hampton was also called from the south, and appointed to command a part ofthe army ofthe north, then encamped at Plattsburgh, on lake Champlain, which amounted to about 4,000 men. As the season for military operations was drawing to a close, measures were immediately taken for carrying into effect the projected invasion. The out line ofthe plan was simply this, to descend the St. Law rence, passing the British posts above, to join general Hampton at some appointed place on the river, and then proceed direct to Montreal ; after which, says Wilkinson's proclamation, \" your artillery, bayonets, and swords, must secure you a triumph, or provide for you honourable graves.\" Grenadier's island, situated between Sacket's harbour, on lake Ontario, and in the state of New York, and Kingston, in Upper Canada, which are only thirty-six miles apart, was the place appointed for the different corps ofthe army to assemble; being only a few miles distant from the river St. Lawrence. On the 2d of October, general Wilkinson left fort George, with the principal body of the troops, and soon after reached the island ; and by the 23d, above 7,000 men"], [262, "246 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. had arrived at the same place. Having provided boats fo transport the artillery through the St. Lawrence, and left colonel Dennis in the command of Sacket's-harbour, the general proceeded to put the army in motion ; but in con sequence of high winds, it was not until the 25th that the vessels could get under weigh. Intelligence was now re ceived, that the British commander was concentrating his force at Kingston, conceiving that place to be the object of attack; in consequence of this information, general Wilkinson, in order to favour the idea, appointed French creek as the place of rendezvous. On the lst of Novem ber, a British squadron made its appearance near French creek, with a large body of infantry, but were prevented from landing by a heavy fire of artillery : the attempt was renewed next morning, but with no better success, and they soon after crossed the river. On the 6th, the American army was put in motion, and the same evening landed within six miles of the British sort Prescott, wliich they endeavoured to pass unobserved, but the moon shining at the time, they were discovered by the enemy, who opened a brisk and well-directed fire. General Brown, with a flotilla of 300 boats, was now in the rear, and waiting until the night grew darker, proceeded down the river, bttt not without being perceived by the British, when a heavy fire was opened upon him ; from which he received little or no injury. Before ten o'clock the next day; they had all safely arrived at the place of destination. A messenger was now despatched to general Hampton, informing him of the movement of the army, and requiring his co-operation. The British by this time had penetrated the design of the invading army, and used every exertion to counteract it. A corps of observation, under colonel Morrison, had been appointed to watch the movements of general Wilkinson's army, and if possible to impede its progress. The American flotilla, in attempting to proceed down the river, was exposed to repeated attacks at the narrow parts of the stream, where they approached within musket shot. At length, after many dangers and obstruc tions, they came to about six miles below Hamilton, and there received intelligence, that their advanced guard of 1,200 men, under colonel M'Comb, had been engaged with the enemy, but without being repulsed, and that some British cavalry had been collected at a place called White-house, at a contraction of the river ; to which place the flotilla was ordered to proceed. But their advance was greatly retarded by the menacing position"], [263, "247 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. of the British army, which hung upon their rear, and by the difficult navigation of the St. Lawrence. On the morning 'of the 11th, the American general Boyd, with nearly 4,000 men, attacked the corps of observation, under colonel Morrison, at Williamsberg. The action soon became general, when the Americans made an attempt to turn the left flank of the British, but were frustrated in their design by the excellent disposition of the troops, a part of which advanced forward, firing by platoons. Defeated in this quarter, thefy made a similar effort against the right, wliich was attended with still worse success ; being obliged to surrender one of their field-pieces. Colonel Morrison, in his turn, now became the assailant, and was vigorously opposed by the Ameri can commander, who concentrated his force to prevent the advance of the British ; but after a well-sought action of two hours, the Americans gave way on all sides, and abandoned their position. In this batt e the loss of the British iu killed and wounded amounted to 180, including twelve missing ; on the side of the Americans, 102 were killed, 237 wounded, and above 100 taken prisoners: among the wounded were general Covington, mortally, one colonel, three majors, five captains, and five lieu tenants. On the 13fh, general Wilkinson, who had been for some time confined to his bed, received a letter from general Hampton, stating, that from the scarcity of pro visions he could not bring his troops forward according. to orders ; but that he should retire to Plattsburgh, with a view of opening a communication between the two armies further down the river. This letter, which was considered as a refusal on the part of Hampton to co operate, put an end at once to the further prosecution of the design against Montreal ; and the American army crossed the St. Lawrence, and went into winter-quarters at French-mills. The troops under general Hampton soon followed the example ; and in consequence of his illness, the command was assumed by general Izard. The repeated disasters which had attended the different attempts on Canada, bad now left that country without fear of invasion ; and the British army were enabled to act on the offensive. On the 10th of December, a de tachment under colonel Murray, arrived in the neigh bourhood of fort George, then in possession of the Americans. General M'Clure, who commanded the garri son, on the approach of the enemy, blew up the fort, and passed the river ; having previously burnt the beautiful"], [264, "248 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. Village of Newark, in consequence of misconceiving dis orders he had received from the secretary at war : this unfortunate event was attended with results afflicting to humanity. After the evacuation of sort George, the Whole of the British side of the Niagara was abandoned by the Americans. It was now determined to retaliate for the burning os' Newark ; accordingly, at day-iight, on the 19th, sort Niagara was surprised by colonel Murray, with a force1 Of 550 men, and the place carried, after a spirited resist iance, with the trifling loss of six men killed and five wounded ; while the loss of the garrison wds sixty-five killed, fourteen wounded, and 344 made prisoners. This Ss according to colonel Murray's report; but the Ameri can account says, that nearly 300 were put to the sword, Only about twenty being able to effect their escape. In the fort was found twenty-seven pieces of cannon, 3,000 etand of arms, a number of rifles, and a large quantity of clothing and camp equipage- Captain Leonard, who had the command of the garrison, was absent at the time, and had taken no precautions whatever against an assault: in general M'Clure'S report, he charges him with having deserted to she enemy. On the same day on which fort Niagara fell, Lewistown surrendered to the British, and, with Manchester, Young's-town, and the Indian village of Tuscarroras, was reduced io ashes, and hlany of the inhabitants put to death. On the 30th, a large detachment, under major-general Riall, accompanied by a great number of Indians, crossed the Niagara, with the intention of attacking Black-rock and Buffalo. At the approach of the British to the for mer place, a heavy fire was commenced by the militia under general Hall ; but they were unable to withstand the gallant and determined advance of the assailants, who compelled them to retreat to Buffalo, two miles distant. Here the Americans, being 2,000 strong, attempted to make a stand, but the resistance of undisciplined troops was vain against such an enemy. The American militia soon broke and fled in disorder, betaking themselves to the woods, and leaving the British in possession of the town, which was soon after fired, and reduced to a heap of ruins. Eight pieces of cannon, and 130 prisoners fell into the hands of the victors ; whose loss UpOn this occa sion was thirty-one killed, sixty-seven vyounded, and nine missing; the loss of the vanquished in killed and wound ed was estimated at three hundred. On the evening of the same day, the village of Blackrock was consigned"], [265, "249 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. to the flames; and the whole frontier, sor many miles, exhibited a scene of ruin and devastation. But the work of retaliation was not yet complete ; a detachment was sent down the river to destroy the fort of Niagara, the last remaining cover of the Americans in this quarter, A dreadful scene of desolation now presented itself; all the towns and villages on the American side of the river Niagara, for the distance of thirty-seven miles, were destroyed. The military transactions at the close of this campaign having assumed a most ferocious character, more resembling the conduct of the savage allies now employed by both British and Americans, than th\u00bb honourable warfare of civilized nations, On the 6th of December congress again assembled ; party spirit had almost reached its crisis, and the debates were carried on with the most virulent animosity. Some of the New England states carried their opposition to a most dangerous height, (see page 211), not only against the administration, but even against the federal constitu tion itself. On the 7th of January, 1814, a message was received from the president, announcing that, though the prince regent of England had declined the mediation of the emperor of Russia, to reconcile the existing differences between Great Britain and America ; yet, was willing to enter into a direct negociation, either at London or Gottenburg. This proposal was immediately accepted, and Gottenburg, as a neutral territory, fixed upon for th\u00bb meeting of the plenipotentiaries. No sooner had the northern army retired into winter. quarters, than the public attention was called to the interesting events which had taken place in the country of the Creek Indians. In the course of the summer, the settlers near Oakmulgee river, in Georgia, became so much alarmed from the hostile behaviour of the Creeks, that the greater part of them abandoned their plantations, and shut themselves up in forts; and the peace party among the Indians shut themselves up with them. At length the majority of the Creek warriors, in defiance of the opinion of their most sagacious chiefs, procured arms from the Spaniards in Florida, and de clared war against the United States. The commence ment of hostilities was witnessed by one of the most shocking massacres to be found in the history of Indian wars. On the 30th of August, fort Mims, in which the greatest number of families had been collected, was sur prised by a large body of the savages, and the garrison, with about 260 of the inhabitants, and 100 negroes, cruelly"], [266, "250 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. butchered. Ofthe whole number of persons in the place, not more than thirty escaped. Ou the receipt of this disastrous intelligence, a part of the Georgia militia, and the volunteers aud militia of Tennessee, under brigadier-general Floyd and general Jackson, were detached to revenge the massacre, and strike terror into the savages. During the month of November, sour battles were sought at different places, in all of which the Indians were defeated and their villages destroyed ; though they fought with the utmost despera tion, neither giving nor receiving quarter. The sangui nary details of this war are little more than a repetition of victories ou the oue side, and of defeat and misery on the other. The last battle which took place in this very unequal contest, was fought on the 27th of March, in which the greater part of the Indians were slain. On tlie morning of - that day, general Jackson arrived at a place called the Horse- shoe-bend of the river Coose. Nature furnishes few situations so eligible for defence, and here the Creeks, by the direction of their prophets, had made their last stand. Across the neck of land they had formed a breast-work of the greatest compactness and Strength, from five to eight feet high, and provided with a double row of port-holes: this breast-work inclosed no less than 100 acres of land. Warriors from six different districts, amounting in the whole to more than 1,000, composed its garrison. General Jackson having detached a body of troops to attack tiie enemy in the rear, determined on taking the place by assault-. Colonel Williams and major Mont gomery, who led on the regular troops, were soon in possession of the nearest part of the breast-work, and were well supported by the militia. Having maintained for a few minutes a very obstinate contest, muzzle to muzzle through the port-holes, in which many of the Indians balls were trausfixed upon the bayonets of the assailants, they succeeded in gaining the opposite side of the works. The event was no longer doubtful; the Indians, fighting with that bravery which desperation inspires, were cut to pieces, and the whole margin Of the river strewed with the slain. About 300 were drowned in attempting to flee, and 557 killed in action ; not more than fifty could have escaped : among their slain was their famous prophet Manahoe, and two others of less note. Jackson's loss was twenty-six white men killed, and 107 wounded ; twenty-three friendly Indians killed, and forty seven wounded. \u2014 The total loss of the Americans in the"], [267, "251 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. different battles during this short but sanguinary war, amounted to ninety-four killed, and 484 wounded ; of the Indians were killed 1,834, wounded not known. This action, which was continued for five hours, termi nated the Creek war. Two of their principal chiefs were taken prisoners ; and their speaker, who wa\u00bb likewise a chief, finding the battle totally lost, surrendered himself also.* In a short time afterwards, a treaty of peace was concluded on severe but just terms. The Creeks ceded a portion of their country as an indemnity for the ex pences of the war ; allowed roads to be made through their territory, and their rivers to be navigated ; and stipulated to hold no intercourse with any British or Spanish post. The United States undertook to guarantee their possessions ; to restore all their prisoners ; and in consideration of their destitute situation, to furnish them with the necessaries of life, gratis, until they could pro vide for themselves. After the failure of the campaign against Canada, the northern army remained in winter-quarters until the latter end of February. Indeed, on the part of Britain, warlike operations seemed to languish for a time ; but no sooner was the power of Bonaparte overthrown in Europe, than the British ministry resolved to prosecute the contest with increased vigour. The peace of Paris was scarcely rati- fied, before 14,000 of those troops which had gained so much renown under the duke of Wellington, were em- barked at Bourdeaux for Canada. About the same time a strong naval force, with an adequate number of troops, was collected, and despatched for the purpose of invading different parts of the coast of the United States. The American army, under general Wilkinson, was at this time stationed at Plattsburgh, with 2,000 men under general Brown, at Sacket's-harbour. On the 30th of March, Wilkinson, at the head of 4,000 men, crossed the Canada line, and attacked the position of La Cole, near Odell-town, commanded by major Hancock ; but the, resistance made by the garrison was so spirited and determined, that the assailants were obliged to return to Plattsburgh, with the loss of 146 men killed and wounded. The British loss in this affair was eleven killed and forty * Some time after the engagement, this undaunted warrior addressed general Jackson in the following words : \" Know, commander, that I fought at fort Minis \u2014 I also fought your array from Georgia \u2014 I did you all the injury in my power ; and had I heen properly supported, I would have done you more. But my warriors are all slain \u2014 I cannot fight any longer.

The unfortunate issue of this attack, and the failure of the last campaign, brought general Wilkin son into disrepute with the public ; and government, yielding to the popular voice, thought proper to suspend him from his command, and the army was left under general Izard. \u2014 Wilkinson was afterwards tried by a court-martial, and honourably acquitted of all the charges against him. Before the reinforcements from Europe arrived in America, an expedition was undertaken under the com mand of general Drummond and commodore Yeo,. against the fort of Oswego, on lake Ontario. On the 5th of May, the British commenced a heavy bombardment against the place, which was defended by 300 men, under the command of colonel Mitchell. In the first attempt they were repulsed, but returning again to the attack, they succeeded in capturing the fort; the garrison having effected their escape, with the exception of about sixty, most of whom were wounded ; the naval stores were carried off; but a quantity of provisions, and some small craft, fell to the victors. The loss of the Americans oa this occasion, was sixty-nine killed and wounded ; that of the British, twenty-two killed, and seventy-three wounded. Another attempt on a small scale, made by the British on Sandy-creek, proved unfortunate, and was attended with a loss of eighteen men killed, and fifty severely wounded. Four lieutenants of the navy, two lieutenants of marines, and 130 seamen were made pri soners; all their boats were likewise captured. No further event of any consequence transpired in this quarter until late hi the summer. On the 3d of July, a large American force, under major-general Brown, crossed the river Niagara, and advancing against fort Erie, demanded the surrender of the garrison ; major Buck, who commanded the fort, instead of making an attempt to defend the place, surrendered it at the first summons; himself, and 140 men, being made prisoner* of war. After the fall of fort Erie, general Brown advan ced towards the British lines of Chippeway ; upon which, major-general Biall, who commanded the British troops in the neighbourhood, ordered a large detachment to advauce, for the purpose of reconnoitring the position, and ascertaining the number of the enemy. Early in the morning of the 5th, several skirmishes took place between the out-posts, and at four o'clock in the afternoon, both armies were drawn up in battle array, on a plain about a mile to the west of Chippeway, and a very short distance"], [269, "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 253 from the celebrated falls of Niagara. The Americans, in expectation of being attacked, had chosen a position, with their right, under general Scott, resting on an orchard, close to the river Niagara, and strongly sup ported by artillery; their left, under general Porter, rested on a wood, with a body of riflemen and Indians in front; and general Ripley's brigade placed in reserve. In a few minutes the British advanced in three columns, while their Indian allies occupied the woods on the right. In about half an hour a sharp action commenced between the Canadian militia, supported by the Indians* and the American riflemen and Indians, who for a short time withstood the attack ; but the British light troops coming up, the New York and Pennsylvania volunteers gave way, and fled in every direction. General Brown perceiving this, ordered Scott's brigade and Towson's artillery to advance, and draw the enemy into action on the plains of Chippeway : this was effected immediately on crossing the bridge. Major Jessup, a gallant young officer, who commanded the third brigade, was ordered to turn the right of the British, which was steadily ad vancing to the attack. This produced a severe contest, and Jessup being closely pressed in flank and rear, he deliberately gave orders to his men to support arms and advance, under a dreadful fire, until he gained a secure position. Captain Towson had now advanced iu front of the British left wing, with three pieces of artillery, and took a position near the river. The steady and unremit ting fire of these guns, had a visible effect upon the ranks of the British army; and the explosion of one of their ammunition waggons soon after, silenced their strongest battery. After the lapse of an hour from the time the action became general, captain Towson turned his guns upon the British infantry, upon which he poured a heavy discharge of grape and cannister shot ; and they were already exposed to an oblique fire from major M'Neill's musketry. General Riall, no longer able to sustain this concentrated fire, and apprehending the issue of the con test with major Jessup on the right flank, ordered a re treat, and the troops fell back to their intrenchments behind Chippeway. This may be considered the first regular pitched battle between the contending parties, and' was fought with great judgment and coolness on both sides. The loss of the Americans in this action was 338, killed, wounded, and missing; among tbe wounded were colonel Campbell, captains King, Read, and Harrison, and lieutenants Palmer, Brambell, Barron, De Witt, and"], [270, "254 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. Patchim. The British loss was sis commissioned officers, seven sergeants, 134 rank and file killed ; twenty-six com missioned officers, eighteen sergeants, 275 rank and file wounded ; one officer, one sergeant, forty-one rank and file missing. Among the killed were captains Bailey, Rowe, and Turney ; lieutenants Gibbon and M'Donnell, and ensign Rea. Lieut. -colonel the marquis of Tweedale, and lieutenant-colonel Gordon, captains Holland and Sherrard, and lieutenant Hendrick were severely wound ed, the rest of the officers slightly. The numbers engaged on each side at the battle of Chippeway is not certainly known ; that of the British is stated by their general at 1,500 regulars, exclusive of militia and Indians; by the same authority, the American force amounted to 6,000 men. After the engagement, the American army took post at Chippeway, and the British retreated to a position near fort Niagara. On the morning of the 25th of July, general Drummond, with about 800 men, proceeded to reinforce general Riall ; but when within a few miles of his post, he met the British retreating before the Ameri cans, who were advancing in great fosce, under general Brown. The British general instantly countermanded the retreat, formed in order of battle, and moved forward to meet the enemy, whom he found posted on a rising ground at Bridgewater, within the tremendous roar of the falls of Niagara. Immediately the fronts of the con tending armies were warmly aud closely engaged ; the Americans making desperate and repeated efforts against the left and centre of the British, which were for a time obliged to fall back. In the mean time, a tremendous cannonade was kept up against the American line, which was returned by captain Towson's artillery, but without being able to bring his pieces to bear upon the eminence where the enemy was posted. The action was continued for an hour with little advantage on either side; when the eleventh and twenty-second regular regiments having expended all their ammunition, both their colonels being severely wounded, and all the captains of the former, and most of the officers of the latter, either killed or wounded, general Brown ordered both regiments to be withdrawn from action ; upon which most of the officers attached themselves to the ninth, and sought in various capacities. The elevated ground held by the British artillery, sup ported by infantry, was considered by the American general as the key to the whole position ; and he was"], [271, "255 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. determined if possible to dislodge the enemy. Addressing himself to colonel Miller, he asked whether he thought he could storm the batteries at the head of the twenty first regiment, while the general himself would support him with the twenty-third ? To this, the wary, but intrepid, veteran replied, \" I will try, sir ;\" words which were afterwards given as the motto of his regiment. Tho twenty-third was immediately formed in close column under major M'Farlane, and the two regiments moved on to ono of the most perilous charges ever attempted , the whole of the artillery opening upon them as they advanced, supported by a powerful line of infantry in the rear. The twenty-first advanced steadily to its pur pose ; the twenty-third faultered on receiving the deadly fire of the enemy ; but was instantly rallied by the per sonal exertions of general Ripley. When within 100 yards of the summit, they received another dreadful dis charge, by which major M'Farlane was kilted, and the command devolved ou major Brooks. The struggle at this point was now arduous in the extreme ; and the British troops, finding themselves severely pressed, form ed round the colours of the eighty-ninth regiment, and fought with the most determined valour. While contend ing for the heights, the British left flank had been turned by major Jessup ; and general Riall having been severely wounded, was taken prisoner while moving to the rear ; this event was announced by loud huzzas in the American army. ln the centre, the repeated and resolute attacks of the Americans were received with firm resolution and un daunted bravery, and they were invariably repulsed at every attempt. These furious attacks were directed against' the British cannon in so determined a manner, that the artiilery-men were bayonetted in the act of load ing, and the muzzles of their adversaries' guns brought nearly in contact with theirs. During this extraordinary conflict, night overtook the combatants, and the British troops having been for a short time driven back, lost some of their cannon, which, however, were retaken, and one captured from tbe Americans. About nine o'clock, after the battle had raged for three hours, general Brown brought up his reserve, and the contest was renewed with determined bravery. The New York and Pennsylvania volunteers, led on by general Porter, made a desperate charge, which in a great measure retrieved their credit, and obtained the applause of their commander-in-chief. About the same time general Drummond also received"], [272, "256 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. reinforcements, which appears to have decided the for tune of the day. The Americans continued their efforts to carry the hill until midnight, when being unable to make any further impression, they gave up the contest, and retired to their camp beyond Chippeway ; on the day following, they abandoned this camp, after throwing a part of their baggage and provisions into the rapids, and continued their retreat towards fort Erie. The loss on either side was proportioned to the nature of this dread ful and sanguinary battle. On the side of the British, one assistant adjutant-general, one captain, three sub alterns, and seventy-nine uon-commissioned officers and privates were killed ; lieut. -general Drummond, major general Riall, and three lieutenant-colonels, two majors, .ight captains, twenty-two subalterns, and 512 non commissioned officers and privates were wounded : the prisoners and missing, six captains, nine subalterns, and 225 non-commissioned officers and privates ; making in all 873 men. Many officers of distinction fell on the American side, and the total loss was little less than that of the British. It consisted of one major, five captains, five subalterns, and 159 non-commissioned officers and privates killed ; major-general Brown, brigadier-generals Scott and Porter, two aids-de-camp, one brigade-major, one colonel, four lieutenant-colonels, one major, seven captains, thirty-seven subalterns, and 515 non-commis sioned officers and privates, wounded ; and one brigade major, one captain, six subalterns, and 102 non-commis sioned officers and privates missing ; making a total of 851, and a difference of twenty-two only between the contending parties. According to the accounts of the British and American generals, neither of their armies amounted to more than 2,800 men ; that of the former to no more than 1,600 during the first three hours of the engagement. In consequence of generals Brown and Scott being both severely wounded, the command of the American army devolved upon general Ripley, who fell back to fort Erie, and immediately began to extend the defences of the place ; having learned that general Drummond was advancing with a strong force in order to recapture it. The fort being nearly completed on the 7th of August, from this time to the 14th, there was almost an incessant cannonade, and many skirmishes between the out-posts and reconnoitring parties ; in one of which the Americans lost major Morgan, a gallant officer, who was greatly . amented. General Gaines arrived shortly after the com-"], [273, "257 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. meneement of the siege, and being the senior officer, assumed the command. The British commander having reason to think that a sufficient impression had been made by the artillery, determined to carry the place by storm during the night ; and the besieged, not knowing where the attack would be made, were prepared to meet it at every point. The fort and bastions were commanded by captain Williams ofthe artillery; the battery on the lake, by captain Douglas ; a blockhouse by major Trimble ; the batteries in front, under captains Biddle and Fanning, supported by general Porter; and the whole body off artillery throughout the garrison, under major Hindman. The first brigade of infantry, under colonel Aspinwal, was posted on the right ; and general Ripley's brigade, supported by Towson's battery, upon the left. \u2022, A few hours before the commencement of the assault, a shell thrown into the fort exploded a magazine, which was succeeded by a loud shout from the besiegers : the shout was returned by the garrison, accompanied by a discharge of Towson's heavy guns. At half past two o'clock in the morning of the 15th, two hours before day-light, a British column, under lieutenant-colonel Fischer, advanced to the attack, and proceeded to within about ten yards of the intrenchment, when a tremendous fire was opened upon it by the second brigade, under major Wood, and captain Towson's artillery, which com pelled the assailants to fall back in confusion. Colonel Fischer, rallying his men, led them on with redoubled fury, and was again repulsed, with still greater loss ; but the possession of this battery being essential to the general plan of assault, he next endeavoured to carry his object by wading the lake : in this unsuccessful attempt a great number of his men were either killed or drowned, and the remainder retreated to their encampment. The other British columns, having waited until the first was com pletely engaged, approached under colonels Scott and Drummond ; the former moving rapidly to the right along the lake, while the latter advanced to the assault in front. A vigorous attack made by the column under colonel Scott, was successfully resisted by the Douglas battery, the New York and Pennsylvania volunteers, a part of the ninth infantry, under captain Foster, and a six-pounder directed by colonel M'Ree. Their fire was so well directed, that the advanced party paused at the distance of fifty yards, and then recoiled ; but another column composed of the bravest men, applied their scaling-ladders and mounted the parapet, notwithstanding"], [274, "258 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. the heavy fire of the artillery. This attack was alsd unsuccessful, the besiegers being assailed with so much effect, as to be compelled to retreat, with the loss of colonel Scott and nearly one-third of their numbers. But the centre column, led on by colonel Drummond, under cover of the darkness of the night, not a little increased by the smoke, gallantly scaled the walls, and gained the parapet; and having carried the bastion at the point of the bayonet, actually turned the guns ofthe fortress against its defenders. A most sanguinary strife now ensued ; but every attempt to dislodge the assailants proved ineffectual, until in a moment all operations were arrested by the accidental explosion of a quantity of ammunition which had been placed under the platform, and by which nearly all the troops that had entered the place were dreadfully mangled. After this disastrous occurrence, the British were so fully persuaded that the explosion had been designed, that all the exertions of the few surviving officers could riot restore order, or prevail ou them to continue the contest. The reserve, which had been advancing, now fell back, and about day-light the besiegers abandoned the enterprise, and retreated to their own batteries. The British left 222 killed, among them fourteen officers, including lieut. -colonel Drummond ;* 174 wounded, and 186 prisoners, making a total of 582; but the official statement of general Drummond makes the loss amount to 905. The Americans had seventeen killed, fifty-six wounded, and ten privates taken prison- ers, in all eighty-three. The British general still continued the siege of fort Erie, but had relinquished the idea of carrying the place Otherwise than by regular approaches. About this time general Gaines was severely wounded by the bursting of a shell, which obliged him to retire to Buffalo ; and general Brown, having sufficiently recovered from his wounds, returned to the command of the fort. Nothing, however, of importance occurred until the 17th of Sep- tember, when on the morning of that day, the commander- in-chief ordered all the infantry and riflemen, with the Indians, to hold themselves in readiness for a sortie against the British batteries. At two o'clock, the troops Were drawn up in order, and general Porter's division, * The American accounts speak in high terms of tbe bravery displayed by this gallant oflicer ; but they also cust a severe reflection on his memory, by asserting, that during the attack he frequently vociferated to his men, \"Give the damned Tankies no quarter '.\" \u2014 The same charge has been made against colonel Short* who Was killed in attempting tostorm the fort at Sandusky, in August, 1813."], [275, "259 united states of America. Composed of two columns under colonel Wood and gene* ral Davis, with the riflemen and Indians commanded by colonel Gibson, was ordered to proceed through the woods, by a passage which had been previously opened. The advance was made with such caution and celerity, that when they rushed upon the enemy's flank, it was the first intimation given of their approach. A severe con flict for a moment ensued, in which colonels Wood and Gibson fell at the head of their columns ; but in thirty minutes, two batteries in this quarter were carried, toge ther with a block-house in the rear, and the garrison made prisoners. At this moment general Miller came up, and in conjunction with colonel Gibson's column, pierced between the second and third line of batteries, and after a severe contest carried the first of these : in this assault general Davis fell at the head of the volunteers, The whole of these batteries, and the two blook-houses, having been taken, after a gallant resistance, general Miller's division inclined to the more formidable batteries towards the lake shore ; and at this moment they were joined by the reserve under general Ripley. Here the resistance was most obstinate ; every attack being made and opposed by the bayonet. At length Miller succeeded in piercing the intrenchments, and the fate of the batteries was speedily decided. The assailants having spiked the British cannon, and completely attained the objects of the sortie, retired within their own lines, Thus, in little more than one hour, the result of forty-seven days inces sant labour was destroyed ; and the efficient force of the British army diminished at least 1,000 men, of whom 385 were made prisoners. The American loss amounted to eighty.three killed, 216 wounded, and a like number missing : including forty-five commissioned officers. A few days after the destruction of his works before fort Erie, general Drummond broke up his encampment, and marched to fort George. Important battle on lake Champlain, engagements at sea, capture of Washington, battle of Baltimore, &c. \u2014 It bas been already noticed, that a part of the army which had distinguished itself so much under the duke of Wellington, had been embarked in France for Canada. During the months of July and August these troops arrived in the St. Lawrence, and a part of them being sent up to contend with general Brown on the Niagara, 8 ."], [276, "260 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. the remainder were organized by sir George Prevost, for the purpose of entering the state of New York by lake Champlain. On the 3d of September, the invading army, amounting to 14,000 men, under the governor-general, arrived at the line of separation between Lower Canada and the United States ; when the Americans abandoned their camp, which was immediately occupied by the British forces. Having now taken possession of lake Champlain, on the 6th the whole division moved forwards upon Plattsburgh, in two columns ; the right led by major general Power, and the left by major-general Brisbane. The inhabitants of tbe town fled with their families and effects, excepting a few men and boys, who formed them selves into a company, received rifles, and were exceed ingly useful. The right column of the British army advanced rapidly, meeting with little obstruction ; the New York militia, under colonel Mooers, having broke and fled in the greatest disorder upon the approach of the enemy. General Power's column now entered Platts burgh, and having thrown his light troops into the houses near the bridge, kept up a most destructive fire from the windows. After the whole of the American troops had crossed the bridge, the plauks were taken up, and piled in such a manner as to form a breastwork, from which it was intended to dispute the passage of the river. From the 7th to the 11th, sir George Prevost was engaged in bringing up his battering train, and constantly skirmish ing at the bridges and forts; in the mean time captain Downie, who commanded the British squadron on lake Champlain, was ordered to advance into the bay of Plattsburgh, in order to co-operate with the land forces. On the morning of the 11th, the flotilla appeared in view, steering for the bay, with the determination to engage the American squadron under commodore Macdonough. At the same instant, the British batteries opened upon the American position behind the river Saranac, where general Macomb was strongly posted with 1,500 men; and the brigades under generals Power and Robinson, were ordered to force the ford, and to escalade the works upon the right. The American fleet, which consisted of the Saratoga, of 26 guns; the Eagle, 20 guns ; the Ticonderoga, 17; the President, 7 ; and ten galleys, six of which carried two, and the remainder one gun each, was moored in line abreast of their intrenched camp, with a division of five gun-boats on each flank. The British naval force was com posed of tbe Confiance, of 39 guns ; the Linnet, 16 ; the"], [277, "261 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. sloops Chub and Finch, 1 1 guns each ; and thirteen galleys, five of wliich carried two, and the remainder one gun each. At eight o'clock the American gun-boats commenced a heavy fire upon the enemy's vessels, and at niue, the British fleet anchored in line, abreast of Macdonough's squadron, at about 300 yards distance ; the Confiance opposed to the Saratoga, the Linnet to the Eagle, the British galleys and one of the sloops to the Ticonderoga, and the left division of the American galleys ; the other sloop to the right division : the crew. on both sides cheered, and commenced a close and spirited engagement. The whole force of both squadrons was immediately in action ; the Saratoga suffering greatly from the fire of the Confiance ; but the fire of the Saratoga was also very destructive to her. In a short time the Chub, having her cables, bowsprit, and main-boom shot away, drifted into the American line, and was finally obliged to surrender. At half past ten o'clock, the Eagle, being unable to bring her guns to bear, cut her cable and anchored in a more eligible situation, between the Sara- toga and Ticonderoga ; but by this movement she left the Saratoga exposed to a galling fire from the Linnet. The guns on the starboard side of the Saratoga being nearly all dismounted, or unmanageable, a stern anchor was let go, and the ship winded with a fresh broadside on her opponent, which soon after struck her colours, having above one-third of her crew killed and wounded ; her gallant commander being among the former. The Sara- toga could now direct her whole fire against the Linnet, which surrendered in about fifteen minutes, and the sloops Chub and Finch were obliged to follow her exam- ple ; the gun-boats owed their escape to the shattered condition of the American vessels; not a mast in either squadron being fit to carry a sail. The Saratoga had fifty-five round shot in her hull, the Confiance 105; and the lower rigging of both ships being nearly all shot away, hung down as though it had been just placed over the mast heads. This naval engagement was in full view of both armies at Plattsburgh. The killed on board the American fleet amounted to fifty-two, the wounded to fifty-eight. On board the captured vessels the killed amounted to eighty four, including captain Downie; the wounded to UO. The number of men in the American squadron was 820; in the British, 1,050. During the engagement on the lake, the land forces under generals Robinson and Power, open ed their batteries upon the Americans, and succeeded in"], [278, "262 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. effecting a passage across she Saranac ; but the result of the action on lake Champlain having rendered any fur ther operations byland fmitless, sir George Prevost re called the troops, and at dusk withdrew his artillery from the batteries. About nine o'clock the same night, as much of the baggage as conveyance could be found for, was sent off and also the cannon ; and at two the next morning the whole army retreated, leaving their sick and wounded behindj with vast quantities of ammunition, camp equi page> provisions, &c. The loss of the British from their entrance into Plattsburgh until their retreat, according lo sir George Prevost's account, did not amount to 250 men ; but the desertions alone were numerous and alarming; no less than 300 deserters having gone over to the Ameri cans between the 6th aud the 14th of September; From this, and other causes, every idea of penetrating into the United States from the side of Lower Canada* was entirely abandoned. The British officers of the army and navy who were killed^ Were buried with the honours of war ; and the humane treatment ofthe Americans to the wound ed, and their generous attention to the prisoners, were gratefully mentioned by captain Pring, who succeeded to the command of the British squadron on the fall of cap tain Downie. After the retreat of sir GeOrge Prevost from Platts* burgh, no occurrences of any moment took place on the Canadian frontier during the remainder of the war ; neither of the contending powers having been able to make a permanent impression on the frontier ofthe other. Upon the ocean, the contest was still maintained ; and al ternate victory and defeat left the question of naval supe riority to be decided at a suture period. The uncommon success of captain Porter, in the American frigate Essex, on the coast of South America, has been noticed in page 540. Her numerous captures having af length attracted the attention of the British board of admiralty, captain Hillyar was despatched in the Ph\u0153be frigate, accompanied by captain Tucker, in the Cherub sloop of war, for the purpose of capturing the Essex, and thereby putting an end to the depredations so long committed on the British commerce in the South seas. After a search of nearly five months, the American frigate, along with a corvette, was discovered at anchor in the Spanish port of Yalparaiso, on the coast of Chili. The great inferiority of the Essex and her companion, iu point offeree, deterred them from ven turing to sea in the face of the enemy ; but after having been blockaded six weeks, on the 28th of March, 1814, in"], [279, "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 263 a gale of wind, the Essex parted from ono anchor and dragged the other to sea. Captain Porter now attempted to escape, but endeavouring to pass to windward of the British ships, a sudden squall carried away his main-top mast, and not being able to gain the common anchorage ofthe neutral port he had just left, he ran into a small bay, and anchored within pistol-shot of the shore. He was im mediately pursued by the Ph\u0153be and Cherub, and at thirty-five minutes past three o'clock the action commen ced, the frigate taking a position nnder the stern of the Essex, and the sloop of war on her larboard bow ; but finding her situation too hot, she ran under the stern of her opponent, aud assisted the Ph\u0153be in keeping up a most destructive raking fire. The decks of the Essex soon became strewed with her dead, and her cock-pit filled with the wounded, many of her guns were rendered use less, several of them had their whole complement of men destroyed, and one gun in particular was three times man ned. At length, having all her rigging and sails cut to pieces, except the flying-jib, captain Porter ordered it to be hoisted, cut his cable, and ran down upon the enemy's ships, with the intention of boarding the Ph\u0153be. The firing on both sides was now tremendous, and the slaughter on board the Essex became horrible ; her antagonist still continuing to rake her, while she could scarcely bring a gun to bear upon them. At this moment her situation was awful beyond description ; she was on fire both fore and aft, the flames were bursting up her hatchway, a quantity of powder had exploded below, and an alarm was given that the fire was near her magazine ! Thus surrounded with horrors, without any chance of saving his ship, cap tain Porter turned his attention towards preserving as many of his gallant companions as possible; he according ly summoned his officers for a consultation, but to his astonishment, found that only one (lieut. M'Night) re mained ; all the rest having been either killed or' wounded. The accounts from every part of the ship was now deplor able ; she wras in imminent danger of sinking, and so crowded with the wounded, that even her cock-pit, steer age, ward-room, and birth-deck, could contain no more, and several were killed by the enemy's shot while under the surgeon's hands. At last, after one of the most deter mined and sanguinary conflicts in the history of naval warfare, captain Porter was compelled, at twenty minutes past six o'clock, to issue the painful order to strike the American flag. The severe loss of the Essex sufficiently proves the valour and resolution with which she was de-"], [280, "264 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. fended. Her crew consisted of 255 men, of whom fifty- eight were killed, or died of their wounds, and among them lieut. Cowell ; thirty-nine wounded severely, twenty- seven slightly, and thirty-one missing ; amounting in all to 154. The loss on board the British ships was no more than five killed, and ten wounded ; among the former was lieut. Ingham, ofthe Ph\u0153be; and among the latter, cap- tain Tucker, of the Cherub. In captain Hillyar's official account of this memorable action, with the spirit ofa truly brave man, he speaks in the highest terms of the gallant conduct ofthe enemy; and on the return of captain Por- ter to the United States he was received with open arms by his countrymen, and the most unbounded demonstrations of joy prevailed wherever he appeared. Another severe naval action, terminating unfavourably to the British (lag, occurred exactly four weeks after that which has just been described. The American sloop of war, Peacock, captain Warrington, launched iu October, performed a cruise during the winter, and ou her return was chased into St. Mary's, in Georgia. She soon after put to se;>. again, and on the 2. th of April discovered the British brig of war, Epervier, captain Wales, having seve- ral vessels under convoy: an engagement immediately took place, during which the merchantmen effected their escape. At the first broadside, the fore-yard of the Pea- cock was totally disabled by two round shot ; this accident rendering her fore and fore-topsail perfectly useless, she was obliged to keep aloof during the remainder of the action, which lasted forty-five minutes. In this time she received considerable damage in her sails and rigging, but her hull was not at all injured. The Epervier struck her colours, having five feet water in her hold, her top-mast over the side, her main boom shot away, her foremast cut nearly in two, her fore rigging and stays shot away, her hull pierced by forty-five round shot, twenty of which were within a foot of her water line: eleven of her crew were killed, and her first lieutenant and fourteen men wounded. The sum of 118,000 dollars in specie was found in her, and transferred to the Peacock. Two months after the above action, another naval en gagement occurred, terminatingin like manner unfortunate ly to Great Britain. The American sloop of war, Wasp, captain Blakely, sailed on the 1st of May, and after cap turing seven merchantmen, on the 28th of June, near St. George's channel, fell in with the British brig of war, Reindeer, captain Manners. The two vessels immediately prepared for action, aud at fifteen minutes after three"], [281, "265 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. o'clock were engaged yard-arm to yard-arm. For half an hour the contest was maintained with the utmost bravery, during which the Reindeer was repulsed in two attempts to board her antagonist. At forty-four minutes past-three, captain Blakely gave orders to board in turn, which were promptly executed, when all resistance ceased, and his opponent struck her colours, having lost her gallant com mander, her purser, and twenty-seven men killed, besides forty-two wounded. The loss of the Wasp was five killed, and twenty-one wounded ; among the latter, two midship men and four seamen, mortally. The difference between the two ships in point of force, was much in favour of tho Wasp ; and so completely shattered was the Reindeer, that on the following day she was blown up, and captain Blakely steered for L'Orient to provide for the wounded of both crews. On the 27th of August, the Wasp again put to sea, and on the lst of September, at seven o'clock in the evening, was met by the British sloop of war, Avon, of twenty guns, commanded by captain Arbuthnot. At half-past nine, an action commenced, which lasted until ten o'clock, and terminated in the surrender of the British sloop ; but before the Wasp could take possession of her prize, three other British ships appeared, which compelled the Ameri can commander to abandon his capture, and seek his own safety in flight. The loss of the Wasp in this engagement was two killed and one wounded. The British loss was never ascertained ; the Avon having sunk soon after the action : the remainder of her crew was saved by the Casti lian and Tartanes sloops of war. The Wasp afterwards continued her cruise, making great havock among the merchant vessels, of which she took and destroyed no less than fifteen. The shifting scenes of war, carried on over a surface of land and sea so very extensive, and with objects so various, once more bring us back to the Atlantic sea-coast of the United States. The operations of the British armaments on that coast had hitherto been on a small scale, and cal culated rather to alarm and irritate than to produce any permanent effect ; but during the present year the resolu tion was taken to \" destroy and lay waste such towns and districts as might be found assailable.\"* For this purpose a large naval force was employed under admiral Cochrane, having on board a great number of troops commanded by genera] Ross. On the 17th of August, the British fleet \u2022 Admiral Cochrane 's letter to the American secretary ot st\u00bbts, dated August .Sth, J814."], [282, "266 UNITED STATES OF A-MERICA. entered the Patuxent, with the intention of attacking a flotilla of American gun-boats, under commodore Barney, and with the ultimate object of striking a decisive blow against the capital ofthe United States. On the 19th, the army landed at Benedict, forty-seven miles distant from Washington, without opposition, and on the 22d, the ex pedition reached Nottingham, twenty miles from the capital. The British flotilla, consisting of launches and barges, under admiral Cockburn, ascended the river, keeping on the right flank of the invading army. The day following, on approaching the American gun-boats, they were found to be abandoned, and before they could be taken possession of, sixteen out of seventeen (the whole number) were blown up ; commodore Barney and his men having already joined general Winder, the commander-in chief at Washington. The British commanders now deten mined to proceed against the capital city, from which they were only about sixteen miles distant. Late in the even ing of the 22d, general Winder was joined by the presi dent ofthe United States, the secretary at war, the secre tary of the navy, and the attorney-general ; and in the morning the American troops were drawn up at Bladens burg, six miles from Washington, and passed in review before the president. On the 24tb, the British army re sumed its march, and at twelve o'clock discovered the re publicans formed in two lines, strongly posted on com manding heights, on the opposite side of the eastern branch ofthe Potomack, their advance occupying a forti fied house, which, with artillery, covered the bridge over which general Ross had to pass ; while a broad and direct road, leading from the bridge to Washington, ran directly through general Winder's position, which was carefully defended by artillery and riflemen. After the proper dispositions had been formed, the attack was made with such impetuosity, by the British light brigade, under colonel Thornton, that the fortified house was soon carried, and the Americans obliged to re fire to the heights ; while their right, under general Stansbury, and their left, under general Smith, were so severely pressed by the fourth and forty-fourth British re giments, as to be obliged to abandon their guns. The first line having given way, was driven back upon the second, which, yielding to the irresistible attack of the bayonet, and a tremendous discharge of rockets, was thrown into confusion, and fled, leaving the British masters of the field. Ten pieces of artillerv which fell into the hands of the victors, were commanded by commodore Barney, who"], [283, "267 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. was wounded and taken prisoner. By general Ross's des- patches, the American armyT amounted to between eight and 9,000 men, with 300 cavalry ; but, according to general Winder's official accounts, his force did not exceed 6,053 infantry and cavalry. The retreating army being ordered to move upon Washington, their commander removed to that city, where a council was hastily summoned, and at which it was the prevailing opinion, that from the disper- sion ofa large portion ofthe American force, and the dis- organized state ofthe remainder, the defence of the city was impracticable. Under this desponding impression, the troops were ordered to retreat to Georgetown, and to take up a position on the heights near that place. But the general soon found that but few of the militia could be col- lected, the greater part having strayed off in search of food or refreshment, after having suffered much during the day ; and others were almost exhausted, after the pri- vations and fatigues they had experienced. The next day be proceeded to Montgomery, about fourteen miles from Georgetown. General Ross, after having halted his army for a few hours, determined to march upon Washington, and at eight o'clock in the evening the army under his command reached that devoted city. Judging it of consequence to complete the destruction of the public buildings with the least possible delay, the capitol, including the senate house, and house of representatives, was consigned to the flames ; and the arsenal, the dock-yard, the treasury, the war office, and the president's palace, with a rope-walk, and the great bridge across the Potomack, shared the same fate. In the dock-yard, a frigate nearly ready to be launched, and a sloop of war, were consumed. The ob ject of the expedition being thus accomplished, general Ross determined to withdraw the troops, before any great force of the enemy could be assembled. On the evening of the 25th, the army left Washington ; and having reach- ed Benedict on the 29th, the whole force, about 5,000 men, was embarked on the following day without moles tation. The total loss ofthe British in the battle of Bla densburgh, amounted to only sixty-four killed, and 185 wounded ; and the loss of the American army, as stated in their own accounts, in killed, wounded, and prisoners, amounted to no more than 180. Two hundred and six pieces of cannon, 540 barrels of gunpowder, and 100,000 ball cartridges swelled the trophies of the victorious army; and the repeated explosions which took place in the city of Washington and its neighbourhood during the night of NO. XII. 2 M"], [284, "268 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. the 24th, sufficiently proved that the injury inflicted was still more considerable. The capture of Washington excited the most painful sen sations throughout the United States, and the indignant feelings of the people were at first levelled agaiust the whole administration, but soon settled in laying the blame on the secretary at war and general Wiuder. The clamour against the secretary was so loud, after the president re turned to the city, that he was requested to suspend his functions for a time ; but this his honour would not per mit, and he therefore resigned his situation. General Winder demanded an examination of his conduct, and a court-martial, of which general Scott was president, honourably acquitted him. It was now conjectured that the British meant to proceed immediately to Baltimore; and the inhabitants of that place were in the greatest con sternation, which the arrival of the city militia from the field of battle was not likely to allay. A moment of silent, gloomy despondency prevailed, wliich cannot be describ ed ; but in the midst of this disheartening panic, the citi zens rejected all thoughts of capitulation, and under gene rals Smith and Strieker, prepared themselves to oppose the enemy. General Winder, with all the force he could collect, proceeded rapidly to Baltimore ; by this time, however, it appeared that the British had retired to their shipping. Two days after the invading army had left Washington, a British squadron under captain Gordon proceeded to the commercial town of Alexandria, seven miles from the capital, and the inhabitants of that place, being complete ly in the power of the enemy, were compelled to capitu late in order to preserve the town from conflagration and pillage. All the merchandise of every description was re quired to be put on board the shipping then at the wharf, at the expense ofthe inhabitants, and the whole delivered to the British commander. The captured vessels, twenty one in number, were brought off, richly freighted with tobacco, cotton, flour, and public stores. Sir Peter Parker, who ascended the Chesapeak in the sloop of war, Menelaus, in order to attack the town of Bellair, was not so fortunate as captain Gordon had been at Alexandria. He landed with about 120 men on the night ofthe 30th of August, intending to surprise a party of militia encamped under the command of colonel Reid ; but the Americans having heard the approach of the barges, were prepared for the attack. Sir Peter advanced at the head of his men to within seventy yards of the camp, when a heavy and"], [285, "269 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. destructive fire was poured upon the assailants, by which they were compelled to retreat to their ship, with the loss of fourteen killed and twenty-seven wounded ; among the latter was their commander, mortally. The devastation committed by the conquering army in the city of Washington had made a deep impression in Great Britain, iu France, and in many parts of Europe ; but its effect was unexampled throughout the United States. Party spirit, that political fiend, instantly fled, and wish it fled the dissensions which had hitherto para lyzed the efforts of the republic. But one voice was heard from one end of the continent to the other; a complete union was brought about, and the whole nation was seen to rise in its strength. Those who had at first opposed the war, from an opinion of its impolicy, or who condemned the invasion of Canada, now saw only a powerful nation about to pour her armies into America with the avowed intention of desolating the country. The war now came home to the interests and feelings of all men, and the scenes of preparation in every part of the Union, were the most animating that could be conceived. The whole coun try was in motion ; every town was a camp ; and the peaceful avocations of the citizens, which the war had not hitherto interrupted, were nearly laid aside. All the prin cipal cities selected their committees of defence, and the whole ofthe population moved in bands, accompanied by martial music, to the daily occupation of labouring on the intrenchments and fortifications. The New England States, at first so much opposed to the war, now exhibited their usual activity and energy, and gave at once a satis factory proof that nothing was further from their intention than withdrawing from the confederation. The governor of Vermont, who had the year before made an attempt to recal the militia of that state from the public service,- and on which occasion the militia nobly refused to obey him, now endeavoured to atone for his conduct, by calling them forth in the most animated manner, to join the standard of their country. It had been rightly supposed that the first object of at tack would be Baltimore ; and the cities of Philadelphia and New York waited the result with as much anxiety, as if their fate depended upon its successful issue. After the first moments of despondency, occasioned by the capture of Washington, had subsided in Baltimore, and it was discovered that the place would not be assailed immediate ly, the inhabitants set about making preparations for de fence; and under the direction of general Smith, a ditch"], [286, "270 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. was opened, and a breastwork thrown up by the citizens, on the high ground to the north-east ; to effect which, every class of people united, so as completely to protect the town in the only quarter in which it was accessible to land forces. The approach to the city by water was de- fended by fort M'Henry, commanded by major Armistead ; and two batterk-s to the right of the fort were manned by detachments of seamen, under the command of naval offi- cers. It was equally important to the safety of the eity, that in case of an attack by land and naval forces, both should be repelled ; for should fort M'Henry be silenced by shipping, there was nothing to prevent the destruction of the town ; and if the land forces of the enemy were suc- cessful, the fort could no longer be of any avail. The committee of safety, composed of persons advanced in life, and of the most influence, took a large share in the preparations to meet the approaching danger, The British army having re-embarked on board the fleet in the Patuxent, admiral Cockrane moved down the river and proceeded up the Chesapeak; and on the eveningof the 10th of September, appeared at the mouth of the Pa- tapsco, about fourteen miles from the city of Baltimore. On the next day, the land forces, to the amount of at least 6,000 men, debarked at North- point, and under the com- mand of general Ross, commenced their march to the city. About the same time, general Strieker proceeded on the road to North-point, at the head of 3,200 effective men, and at six o'clock in the evening reached the head of Bear- creek, seven miles from Baltimore. On the morning of the 12th, information was received that the British were landing troops, under cover of their gun-vessels, within the mouth of the Patapsco river. The American general now made dispositions to oppose their advance ; but upon the approach of the enemy, his men abandoned their works, and took up another position at the junction of two roads leading from Baltimore to the bay. At half-past two o'clock, the British commenced throwing rockets, which did little injury, and was returned by a six-pounder and a howitzer upon the centre. The fire was brisk for a few minutes, but the advancing army having directed their chief efforts against the American left wing, two regiments of militia fled in confusion, and could never again be ral lied and brought into line. The British army now advan- ced with a heavy fire, which was continued on both sides until twenty-five minutes before four o'clock, during which time general Strieker's force did not amount to 1,400 men ; when, finding that the unequal contest could"], [287, "271 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. be maintained no longer, and that the enemy was about to out-flank him, in consequence ofthe flight of his two re giments, he was compelled to fall back upon his reserve, which he did in good order. Here he formed his brigade, and falling still further back, took post on the left of the line, half a mile in advance of the entrenchments, where he was joined by general Winder. The conduct of the Baltimore brigade, with the exception of the two corps already mentioned, deserved the highest praise. Their loss iu killed and wounded amounted to 163, (about one eighth of the force engaged,) amongst whom were many respectable citizens. Mr. Donaldson, an eminent lawyer, and member of the legislature, was killed ; majors Heath, .Moore, and several other officers, wounded. The loss of the British was fifty-three killed, and 320 wounded; among the former was their commander, major-general Ross, who was killed by a rifle ball during the skirmish which preceded the action ; and the command devolved on colonel Brook. The result of this affair, with the death of the British general, when communicated to the American lines, serv- ed to cheer the spirits of the militia, and inspire confi- dence. Thc trenches and batteries were all fully manned, and the troops continued nnder arms during the night. Next morning the enemy appeared in front of the in- trenchments, at the distance of two miles ; in the mean time, the naval attack had already commenced. Tho fleet, after landing the troops at the Patapsco, proceeded to bombard fort M'Henry; and on the 13th, about sunrise, sixteen ships had been brought within three miles of the fort. The attack began soon after from five bomb vessels, at a nigher distance, which kept up an incessant bomb- bardment, while theyT remained beyond the reach of their enemy's guns. After some time, they approached some- what nearer, so as to be within cannon shot ; when a tre- mendous fire was opened from the fort, which compelled them to regain their former position. The bombardment was kept up dnring the whole day and night; and the city, thus assailed ou both sides, awaited the result with death- like silence, and yet no eye was closed in sleep. Sudden- ly, about midnight, a dreadful cannonade was heard in the direction ofthe fort, and the affrighted population be- lieved that all was lost. Their fears were soon quieted, by the information that some barges of the enemy had at- tempted to land, but were compelled to draw off, after having suffered severely by the fire of fort Covington. Next morning the bombardment ceased, after the British"], [288, "272 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. had thrown 1,500 shells, a large portion of which burst over the fort, and scattered their fragments among its de fenders ; while many of them fell within the works, and greatly injured some of the public buildings. There were four men killed, ancl twenty-four wounded ; among the former were two officers. In the course of the night, ad miral Cochrane held a communication with the command er ofthe land forces, and the enterprise being deemed im practicable, it was mutually agreed to withdraw; and at one o'clock on the morning of the 14th, the British army began its retreat. On the day following the troops were re-embarked, along with a number of prisoners, being persons ofthe first families iu Baltimore. The intelligence of the British having retreated, was received in the neighbouring cities with demonstrations of joy which cannot be described. The feelings of the inha bitants of that city which had escaped \u00abo imminent a danger, cannot be imagined ; measures were taken to celebrate the event, to reward those who had distinguished themselves, and to perpetuate the remembrance of this awful period. To those who fell in the sacred cause of the defence of their fire sides and their homes, a monument was decreed to be erected in the centre ofthe city. An expedition to the river Penobscot had been under taken in the month of August, under general Sherbrooke, and admiral Griffith, in which the British were suc cessful. The troops, after obliging the Americans to destroy the Adams frigate, took possession ofthe northern part ofthe district of Maine, in the name of his Britannic majesty; by which a direct communication was opened between Canada and New Brunswick. Meeting of congress, Creek hostilities, battle of New Orleans, and peace with Great Britain.\u2014 The national legislature convened, on the 20th of September, under very different feelings from what had existed in tbat body for many years past. Party spirit, it is true, was not alto gether at an end, but no other course remained but a union in devising the best means for carrying on the war, which had now become a war of pure defence. The American ministers had been in Europe some months, for the purpose of negociating a peace, yet nothing had been done to wards obtaining that desirable object. It was believed by the Americans, that the British commissioners were not actuated by a sincere desire for the termination of hostili-"], [289, "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 273 ties ; otherwise they would not have proposed, at the first interview, the surrender of an immense portion of the American territory, and a total relinquishment of the shores of tlie great northern hikes. These demands excit ed the utmost indignation, both in congress and through out the United States. It was thought that all hopes of accommodation were at an end, and the people began to prepare their miuds sor a most serious contest. While the congress was occupied in raising money to carry on the war, and in devising means for increasing their military establishments, the public attention was rous ed by au alarming state of affairs to the southward. War was renewed with the Creek Indians, and a powerful in vasion of Louisiana was threatened by Great Britain. About the end of August, general Jackson, whose station was at Mobile, in the Alabama territory, received infor mation that three British ships of war had arrived at the Spanish town of Pensacola, and having landed a large quantity of arms and ammunition, for the purpose of arm ing the Indians, had marched into the fort with 300 troops. On receipt of this intelligence, he immediately wrote to the governor of Tennessee, calling for the whole quota of militia from that state. On the 15th of September, the three ships from Pensacola, under the command of com modore Percy, with a detachment of land forces under colonel Nicholls, appeared off fort Bowyer, at the en trance of Mobile bay. At sour o'clock in the afternoon, an attack was commenced by sea and land ; but the resist ance made by major Lawrence, who commanded the gar rison, was so determined and successful, that after a can- nonade of three hours, the vessels were obliged to retire with great loss. The commodore's ship, carrying 22 thirty two pounders, was driven on shore within 600 yards of the battery, wbere her crew were obliged to set her on fire, and make their escape. General Jackson having in vain remonstrated with the governor of Pensacola for his unwarrantable conduct, de termined to march against that place ; and on the 6th of November arrived before the town, and sent a flag to com municate the object of his visit. His messenger having been fired upon from the batteries, Jackson reconnoitred the fort, and finding it defended both by British and In dians, be resolved to storm it on the day following. At day-light the troops were put in motion, and while a feint was made against the west side of the town, a number of troops passed undiscovered behind the fort to the east quarter. The whole body appeared in view when within;"], [290, "274 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. a mile ofthe place, and entered the town in defiance of a battery of two cannon loaded with ball and grape, and a shower of musketry from the houses and gardens. The battery was soon carried, and the musketry silenced. The governor now made his appearance with a flag, and offer- ed to surrender the town immediately ; which was accept- ed, and every protection afforded to the persons ancl pro- perty of the inhabitants. The commandant of the fort re- fused to surrender until midnight, when he evacuated it with his troops, just as the Americans were preparing to storm the place. The British withdrew to their shipping, seven of which were in the harbour, and Jackson, having accomplished his purpose, returned to Mobile. The danger which at this time threatened the city of New Orleans, required the immediate presence of general Jackson. He arrived there on the 2d of December, and immediately set about embodying the militia, and repair- ing the fort on the river ; at the same time about 1,000 re- gular troops were distributed among the most vulnerable points. Colonel Monroe, the present president of the United States, (1819) then secretary at war, foreseeing the approaching danger, had sent large supplies by the river Ohio, and had called on the governors of Kentucky and Tennessee for an additional number of troops. It was not long after Jackson's arrival, before the British fleet made its appearance in the bay of St. Louis; and on the 12th, the American flotilla of gun-boats, and other small vessels, was attacked on lake Borgne by forty-two heavy launches and gun barges, under captain Lockyer, when, after a spirited resistance, the whole were either taken or des troyed. The arrival of the British squadron in these waters, excited, if possible, a greater degree of alarm than that which had prevailed at Baltimore. Their state of de fence was by no means such as to inspire confidence ; but in the firmness, talents, and good fortune of Jackson they placed their whole reliance. Governor Claiborne had called out the militia en masse, and all the negroes that could be collected together, with the drays and carts, were employed in working on the fortifications. On the 21st, the Tennessee militia, to the number of 4,000, arrived by water, and two days after, the British army landed at the head of lake Borgne ; the capture of the American gun-boats having enabled them to debark without moles tation. General Jackson no sooner heard of their arrival, than he marched at the head of 1,500 men, chiefly volunteers, to oppose their advance, while the New Orleans and Ten-"], [291, "275 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. nessee militia, under general Carrol, were pasted four miles above the city. About eight o'clock in the evening, a heavy flanking fire was opened upon the British by a schooner in the river ; at the same time their right was attacked by a body of cavalry, while Jackson's troops in front advanced upon them with great ardour. But the in vading army, although taken by surprise, and having many suddenly killed and wounded, soon formed and came into action; using their bayonets with such powerful effect, that the American troops were thrown into confu sion, and obliged to retreat to a position nigher the city. In this action, the loss ofthe British was estimated at 200 in killed, wounded, and missing; that of the Americans was twenty-four killed, 115 wounded, and seventy-four made prisoners. On the 25th, sir Edward Pakenham, the British commander-in-chief, accompanied by major-gene ral Gibbs, arrived, and assumed the command of the army. On the 27th, early in the morning, the troops moved for ward to within six miles ofthe city, where they found the main body of the Americans strongly posted behind a breastwork, composed of bags of cotton covered with earth, extending from the banks of the Mississippi to Cypress swamp ; their right resting upon the river, and their left protected by a wood. On the day following, the British general advanced in force, with the intention of driving Jackson from his intrenchments ; and at the dis tance of half a mile, commenced an attack with rockets, bombs, and a heavy cannonade, as he approached the American v.c;l_ , which were not yet finished. During this assault, the columns ofthe assailants were exposed to a severe and constant fire from an armed vessel stationed. in the river, which caused great destruction ; and after a violent struggle of seven hours, the firing ceased on the part of the British; no impression having been made ou Jackson's position. The loss of the Americans in this affair was seven killed, and eight wounded ; that of the British was never ascertained. On the morning ofthe lst of January, 1815, sir Edward Pakenhitm was observed to have constructed batteries near the American works, and soon after day-light, commen ced a heavy fire from them, which was returned with great spirit by Jackson ; at the same time, a bold attempt was made to turn the left ofthe Americans, which was success fully repulsed. In the evening, the British retired from their batteries, having first spiked their cannon; but were obliged to leave a quantity of ammunition behind. The loss of the Americans on this occasion was eleven killed, 2n"], [292, "276 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. and twenty-three wounded. On the 4th, general Jackson was joined by 2,500 men from Kentucky, under general Adair ; aud on the 6th, the British were reinforced by 4,000 troops, commanded by general Lambert. The army under sir Edward Pakenham, thus augmented, amounted to upwards of 14,000 veterans ; that under general Jack son to something more than 10,000, the greater part of them militia and volunteers. The British general now prepared for a serious attempt on the American position. With great labour he had com pleted by the 7th, a canal from the swamp to the Missis sippi ; by which he was enabled to transport a number of boats to the river : it being his intention to make a com bined attack on the main force of general Jackson on the left bank, and crossing the river, attack the batteries on the right. The works of the American general were by this time completed ; his front was a straight line of 1,000 yards, defended by upwards of 3,000 infantry and artil lerists. The ditch, which had been the water-course of a saw-mill, contained five feet water. Eight distinct bat teries were judiciously disposed, mounting in all twelve guns of different calibres. On the opposite side of the river there was a strong battery of fifteen guns, and the intrenchments were occupied by general Morgan, with the Louisiana militia, and a strong detachment of the Ken tucky troops. On the memorable morning of the Sth of January, gene ral Pakenham, having detached colonel Thornton with a considerable force to attack the works on the right bank ofthe river, moved with his whole force, exceeding 11,000 men, in two divisions, under major-generals Gibbs and Keane, and a reserve under general Lambert. The first of these officers was to make thc principal assault, and both columns were supplied with scaling-ladders and facines: during these awful preparations, the Americans anxiously waited the attack, which would decide the fate of New Orleans, aud probably of Louisiana. The British gallantly advanced in solid columns, over an even plain, in the very front of the American intrenchments; the men carrying, besides their muskets, facines, and some of them ladders. A dread silence prevailed, until they ap proached within reach ofthe batteries, which commenced an incessant and destructive cannonade : they, notwith standing, continued to advance in perfect order, closing up their ranks as fast as they were opened by the fire of the Americans. When they came within reach, however, ofthe musketry and rifles, these, joining with the artillery,"], [293, "277 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. produced such dreadful havoc that they were thrown into the greatest confusion. Never was there a more tremen- dous fire, than that kept up from the American lines; it was a continued stream ; the men behind loading for those in front, enabled them to sire with scarcely an intermission. The British columns were literally swept away, whole ranks falling at every discharge; while the \"officers were gallantly making the utmost efforts to rally their men ; and in one of these attempts their brave commander, general Pakenham, was killed. Generals Gibbs and Keane suc- ceeded in pushing forward their columns a second time ; but this approach was more fatal than the first: the advancing columns broke, and no effort to rally them could avail ; a few platoons only advanced to the edge of the ditch, and met a more certain destruction. An un- availing attempt was made by their officers to bring them up a third time; and the determined bravery of those lead- ers deserved a better fate : the two generals, Gibbs and Keane, were carried away severely wounded ; the former mortally. The plain between the front of the British and the American lines was strewed with dead ; so dreadful a carnage, considering the shortness of the time, and the numbers engaged, was perhaps never witnessed. During the engagement on the left side of the river, the detach- ment under colonel Thornton succeeded in landing on the right bank, and immediately attacked the intrenchments of general Morgan. At first the Americans shewed a spirit- ed resistance ; but their right wing supposing itself to be'out- flanked, shamefully fled, and the left being deserted, soon followed the example, leaving the redoubts and batteries, with sixteen pieces of caunon, and the colours ofthe New Orleans militia, in the hands of the victors. Colonel Thornton was severely wounded, and the command de- volved on colonel Gobbins ; who having witnessed the fate ofthe assault on the left bank, and receiving orders from general Lambert, re-crossed the river, and joined the main army. The loss ofthe British in the different actions, from the 12th of December to the 8th of January, accord ing to general Lambert's returns, amounted to 386 killed, 1,516 wounded, and 552 missing. The American Joss, during the same period, by general Jackson's official re port, was forty-nine killed, 150 wounded, and seventy four prisoners. The severe loss on the part of the British extinguished all hopes of success, and general Lambert, after holding a consultation with admiral Cochrane, came to the decision to re-embark the troops, and to abandon the enterprise."], [294, "278 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. The concluding operation of the war in the gulf of Mexico, was the capture of fort Bowyer, on Mobile-point, which had been unsuccessfully attacked about five months before. On the 7th of February, the fort was invested by captain Ricketts, of the Vengeur, and in the course of a few days the trenches were pushed within pistol-shot of tbe works. Lawrence, the American commander, finding it impossible much longer to resist the overwhelming force by which he was assailed, consented to capitulate, and on the 11th, the garrison, consisting of 366 men, surrendered themselves prisoners of war. Except the transactions at New Orleans, and the cap ture of fort Bowyer, no military operations occurred after the conclusion of the treaty of peace between Great Britain and America ; which had been signed at Ghent the very day after the British forces had invaded Louisiana. Two naval actions, however, took place subsequent to that period ; the first of which added the President frigate to the British navy. On the 14th of January, the President, commodore Decatur, sailed from New York on a cruise ; but from the negligence ofthe pilot, having struck on the bar, where she remained two hours, her ballast was de ranged, and her sailing trim totally lost. The wind pre venting him from returning into port, he put to sea, trust ing to the excellence of his vessel. At day-light the next morning, he fell in with a British squadron, consisting of the Endymion, Tenedos, and Pomone, frigates, and the Majestic, razee. In spite of every exertion they gained upon him, and the foremost, the Endymion, got close under his quarter, and commenced firing. The commo dore determined to bear up and engage her, with the in tention of carrying her by boarding, and afterwards escap ing in her, and abandoning his own ship. In this be was frustrated by the man\u0153uvring ofthe enemy, who protract ed the engagement for two hours, until the rest of the squadron was fast gaining upon them. On the approach of the other frigates, the President surrendered, being considerably damaged, and having twenty-four men killed, and fifty-five wounded; the Endymion had eleven killed and fourteen wounded. The next engagement by sea had a different termination to that we have just related. On the 28th of February, the American frigate Constitution, captain Stewart, while cruising off Madeira, fell in with the British ship Cyane, of 34 guns, captain Falcon, and the Levant, of 21 guns, captaiu Douglas ; both of which she captured after a severe action of forty minutes. The Constitution had four men"], [295, "279 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. killed and ten wounded ; the Cyane seven killed and seventeen wounded ; and the Levant nine killed and seventeen wounded. The last naval action between the two contending na tions, was fought on the 23d of March. On the morning of that day, the United States sloop of war Hornet, cap tain Biddle, then on the coast of South America, descried the British brig Penguin, captain Dickenson, which im mediately bore down, and ran along side the Hornet, with the intention of carrying her by boarding. A warm en gagement now ensued, in which the British vessel was repulsed, and her captain killed ; when, after a severe con test of twenty-two minutes, she struck her colours, having had fourteen men killed and twenty-eight wounded ; the loss ofthe Hornet was one killed and eleven wounded. The momentous intelligence ofthe defeat of the British before New Orleans, had scarcely ceased to operate upon the people of the United States, when they received the welcome news of a treaty of peace having been conclu ded between the British and American commissioners, on the 24th of December, 1814.* Both these events were celebrated by illuminations, and other demonstrations of joy throughout every part ofthe Republic. Thus terminated an eventful and memorable war of two years and six months \u2014 a war pregnant with important ad monition to Great Britain and to America.

The effects of the war had compelled the American people to turn their attention to the manufacturing system ; and Great Britain had to witness the best market for her manufactures greatly diminished, and for some particular branches, nearly annihilated. She has likewise seen, that the mode of warfare pursued by her, has produced an union of parties among the Americans, which effectually precludes any future hope of being able to separate the eastern from the other states ; and has for ever placed the republic far beyond the grasp of any European power. The people of the United States have also acquired,^by dearly bought experience, a knowledge of their weakness and of their strength. By their repeated and disastrous attempts to conquer Canada, they have discovered the unfitness of a free government and free people for offensive warfare ; and that their best policy is peace, commerce, and agriculture ; preferring the ploughshare to the sword, and justice to aggrandizement. This salutary lesson, if wisely improved, will be worth the whole sum they have expended on the war; by evincing to them their true na- tional character \u2014 weak in the pursuit of conquest, but all- powerfid in defence. Since the termination of hostilities, the United States have proceeded in a career of prosperity unparalelled in the history of nations. The progressive improvement of their agriculture, commerce, and manufactures, with the annual increase of their exports, both before and after that period, will be found detailed, under their respective heads, between pages 77 and 113 of this Work. The re- turn of peace, by opening the ports to the introduction of foreign articles, has given a temporary check to some of the manufacturing establishments ; but the system in gene- ral is now placed upon a much surer foundation than at any former period, and is proceeding by moderate but cer tain degress to ultimate perfection. Agriculture is in a highly prosperous state, and rapidly improving throughout the Union; to which the judicious plan adopted by govern ment for disposing of all the public lands (see page 103) has not a little contributed. The mechanic arts have kept pace with agriculture ; and those two important branches have been mutually subservient to each other. Those em ployed in them, unlike the same classes in many other countries, are recognised as most useful citizens, and have their equal rights, civil and religious, guaranteed by con stitutions of their own choice ; and the laws enacted and"], [297, "281 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. administered by men especially elected for that purpose, by themselves. \u2014 Stimulated and supported by these, litera- ture, science, and the sine arts are all flourishing. The mercantile interest in the United States, as well as in Great Britain, for reasons already assigned, (page 77,) suffered severely by the return of peace ; but during the last two years, the foreign commerce of the republic has greatly improved, aud is fast rising into its former import- ance. The amount of the revenue is yearly increasing; and by the last report of the secretary of the treasury, is estimated for the year 1819, to exceed the public expendi- ture by nearly three millions of dollars. One ofthe most celebrated orators in the British parlia- ment, astonished at the growth which, in his time, had taken place in the American provinces, then subject to Great Britain, uses the following prophetic language : \u2014 \" Whatever England has been growing to by a progressive increase of improvement, brought in by varieties of peo- ple, by succession of civilizing conquests and civilizing settlements, iu a series of 1700 years, you shall see as much done by America in the course of a single life.\" This auspicious prediction has been fully realized ; and the United States have risen to a distinguished rank among the nations of the earth, with a rapidity of which history fur- nishes no example. Under all these circumstances of na- tional prosperity and general happiness, the inhabitants of that favoured country cannot'be too thankful to the Divina Being for the blessings they enjoy. Kindly separated by nature and a wide ocean from the exterminating havoc of one quarter of the globe ; too high-minded to endure the degradations ofthe others ; possessing a chosen land, with room for their descendants to the thousandth and thou- sandth generation ; entertaining a due sense of their equal rights to the use of their own faculties, to the acquisitions of their industry, to honour and confidence from their fellow-citizens; resulting not from birth but good con- duct, and enlightened by a benign religion, possessed, indeed, and practised in various forms, yet all of them inculcating honesty, temperance, and the love of man . the heart that feels these advantages must dilate with joy, and heave with gratitude to the supreme Giver of all good, whose over-ruling providence, by its dispensations, proves that he delights in the happiness of man here, and his greater felicity hereafter."], [298, "wmw OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. STATE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE. NEW HAMPSHIRE is situated between 42\u00b0 42' and 45 13' N. lat. and 4J 23' and 6\u00b0 10' E. long. It is bounded on the north by Lower Canada; south, by Massachusetts; east, by the district of Maine, and the Atlantic ocean; and west by Connecticut river, which separates it from Vermont. Its length, from north to south, is 160 miles; and its breadth, from east to west, seventy miles; contain ing 8,500 square miles, or 5,440,000 acres. Lakes and rivers. \u2014 The principal lakes in this state are Winnipiseogee, Umbagog, Sunapee, Squam, and Ossapee. The Winnipiseogee is the largest collection of water in the state, being twenty-two miles in length, and from three to eight miles in breadth. Some very long necks of land project into it ; and it contains several islands, on which rattlesnakes are very common. It abounds with fish from six to twenty pounds weight. The mountains which sur round it give rise to many streams which flow into it ; and between it and the mountains are several lesser ponds which communicate with it. Contiguous to this lake are the townships of Monltonborough, on the north-west; Tuftonborough,and Wolfborough on the north-east; Meri dith and Gilmantown on the south-west. From the south east extremity of this lake to the north-west corner, there is good navigation in the summer, and generally a good road in the winter, the lake is frozen about three months in the year, and many sleighs and teams, from the circum jacent towns, cross it on the ice. Winnipiseogee river"], [299, "283 STATE OF NFAV HAMPSHIRE. conveys the waters of the lake into Pemigewa_?et river, through its eastern bank at New Chester ; the united streams there take the name of Merrimack river. Umbagog lake is situated in the north-east oorner of the state, and is next in size to Winnipiseogee ; it lies in Grafton coun ty, and a small part of it in the district of Maine. Suna pee lake, situated in Chester county, is nine miles long and three broad, and sends its waters, through Sugar river, fourteen miles, to Connecticut river. Squam lake, part of which lies in Grafton and the other in Strafford coun ty, is about five miles long and sour broad. Ossapee lake lies north-east of Winnipiseogee, and between them stands Ossapee mountain. The waters of the lake run east, and joined by South river, from Great Ossapee river, which falls into Saco river, near the division line between York and Cumberland counties, in Maine, between Lime rick and Gorham. The most considerable rivers in this state are Connecti cut, Merrimack, Piscafaqua, Saco, Androscoggin, Upper and Lower Arnonoosuck, besides many other smaller streams. The Piscataqua is the boundary line between this state and the district o. Maine ; and forms the harbour for the only shipping' port in New Hampshire, This river has four branches, Berwick, Cochechy, Exeter, and Dur ham, which are all navigable for small vessels from fifteen to twenty miles from the sea. Merrimack river has its course southerly through this state till it enters Massachu setts; it then turns easterly, and passes intwthe ocean at Newbury-port. Vast quantities of ship-timber, and various kinds of lumber, are brought down iu rafts; a great part of which is carried fo Boston, through she Middlesex canal. Six or seven bridges have been thrown over this fine river at different distances from New Concord down wards ; the most elegant and expensive of which is that at Newbury. Mountains and minerals. \u2014 New Hampshire is intersect ed by several ranges of mountains ; the first range of which is called the Blue-hills, passes tbrough Rochester, Bar rington, and Nottingham, and the several summits are distinguished by different names. Behind these are seve ral higher detached mountains, and still farther back are others still more elevated : among which, Chocorus, Ossa pee, and Kyarfarge are the principal. Beyond these last named, is the lofty ridge which divides the branches of Connecticut and _*ierrimack rivers, denominated the 2o"], [300, "284 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. Height-of-Land ; in this range is the celebrated Monad nock mountain. Thirty miles north of this is Sunapee, and forty-eight miles further is Moossehillock mountain. But the White mountains are by far the most stupendous of any in this state, or in New England ; and are perhaps more remarkable than any within the United States. They form the most elevated part of a ridge, which extends north-east and south-west to an immense distance ; the area of their base is an irregular figure, and its whole cir cuit not less than sixty miles. The summits of these moun tains are visible on the land at the distance of eighty miles; the highest peak is in N. lat. 44c and its height 9,000 feet above the level of the sea. This has been distinguished by the name of Mount Washington. The natural productions of this state are ochres, isinglass, crystals, sulphur, free stone, lead, blacklead, and copper ; but the most valuable is iron, which is found in many places, aud is wrought in considerable quantities. Climate, soil, and productions. \u2014 The climate of New Hampshire is highly favourable to health ; but the winters are long and severe. Snow lies on the ground from three to four months, and the use of sledges during that period is general. The spring is rapid, and the heat of summer great, but of short duration ; autumn is very pleasant. This state containing a number of very high mountains, and lying in the neighbourhood of others, whose tops are covered with snow three quarters of the year, renders cold so predominant, that the inhabitants do not expect more than four months of warm weather out of the twelve. The face of the country is greatly variegated. The land next the sea is generally low, from whence it rises gra dually from twenty to thirty miles, when the mountains commence, among which there are large rich valleys, and on Connecticut river a number of fine level plains. Moun tainous countries are observed to be most subject to earth quakes. After the great shocks in 1727 and 1755, which were perceived through a great part ofthe American con tinent, smaller shocks were more frequent in New Hamp shire than in the adjoining states. From 1755 to 1774, \u25a0scarcely a y^ear passed without some repetition ; from that time to 1783, none were observed, and there have been but two or three since. The soil of this state, near the sea-coast, (which is only fifteen miles in extent,) is in many places sandy ; but near"], [301, "sfATE OF *fEW HAMPSHIRE. 285 the banks of rivers it is generally good, as is likewise the \u25a0case in the valleys among the mountains ; many of which are rocky and barren, but others are fertile on the brows, and nearly all are covered with timber* The river laud is most esteemed, producing every kind of grain in the utmost perfection ; but it is not so good for pasture as the uplands. In the new and uncultivated parts ofthe state, the soil is distinguished by the various kinds of timber which grow upou it ; thus, white oak land is hard and stony, the undergrowth consisting of brakes and fern ; this kind of soil will not bear grass till it has been ploughed and hoed ; but it is good for Indian corn, and must be subdued by planting before it can be convert- ed into mowing or pasture : the same may be said of ches\u00ab nut land. Pitch pine land is dry and sandy; it will bear corn and rye with ploughing, but is soon worn out, and needs to lie fallow two or three years to recruit. White pine land i6 also light and dry, but has a deeper soil, and is of course better ; both these kinds of land bear brakes and fern, and wherever these grow, it is an indication that ploughing is necessary to prepare for grass. Spruce and hemlock, in the eastern parts of the state, denote a thin, cold soil, which, after much labour in the clearing, will indeed bear grass without ploughing; but the crops are small, and there is a natural tough sward, which must either rot or be burned before cultivation ean take place. In the western parts, the spruce and hemlock, with a mix- ture of birch, denote a moist soil, which is excellent for grass. When the white pine and the oil-nut tree are sound in the same land, it is commonly a deep moist loam, and is accounted very rich and profitable. Beech and maple land is generally esteemed the most easy and advantageous for cultivation, as it is a warm, rich, loamy soil, which easily takes grass, Indian corn, and grain, withotit plough- ing; and not only bears good crops the first year, but turns immediately to mowing and pasture\": that soil which is deepest and ofthe darkest colour, Is reckoned the best. Black and yellow birch, white ash, elm, and alder, are indications of a good soil, deep, rich, and moist, which will admit grass and grain without ploughing. Red oak and white birch are signs of strong land, and generally the strength of the land is judged of by the largeness of the trees which it produces. Agriculture is, and always will be, the chief business of the people of New Hampshire, if they attend to their true interest. Beef, pork, mntton, poultry, wheat, rye, Indian oom, barley, pulse, butter, cheese, hops, esculent roots"], [302, "286 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. and plants, flax, hemp, &c. are raised in immense quanti ties in this state, and are articles which will always find a market. Apples and pears are the most common fruits cultivated, and no husbandman thinks his farm Complete without an orchard. The uncultivated lands are covered with extensive forests of pine, fir, cedar, oak, walnut, &c. Several ways of raising a crop on new lands have been practised. The easiest and cheapest method was origin ally learned from the Indians, who never look very far forward in their improvements; The method- is that of girdling the trees ; which is done by making a circular in cision through the bark, and leaving them to die standing-. This operation is performed in the summer, and the ground .is sowed in August with winter-rye, intermixed with grass; the next year the trees do not put forth leaves, and the land having yielded a cropj becomes fit for pasture. This method helps poor settlers a little the first year; but the inconvenience of it is, that if the trees are left islanding, they are continually breaking and falling with the wind, which endangers the lives of cattle ; and the ground being constantly encumbered by the falling- trees, is less fit for mowing; sO that if the labour be not effectually done at once, it must be doue iu a succession of time. But the mode of clearing and cultivating new lands has been great ly improved Of late years. At one time it was thought impossible to raise Indian corn without the plough and the hoe ; but the method of planting it among the burnt logs having been introduced, this easy practice soon be came universal in the new plantations. It is now account ed more profitable for a young man to go upou new, than to remain on the old lands. The season of vegetation is short, and is almost wholly employed in preparing, plant ing, and tilling the ground, in cutting and bousing fodder, and gathering in the crops. These labours succeed inva riably, and must be attended to in their proper season ; so that little time can be spared for experiments ; if the peo ple in general were disposed to make any. Indeed, so sudden is the succession of these different operations, that upon any irregularity in the weather* they run into one another, and if help be scarce, which is often the case, one labour cannot be completed before the other suffers for want of being done. Gardens in the country^ towns are chiefly left to the management of women, the men contenting themselves with fencing and digging them; and it must be said, for the honour of female industry, that the small portion of earth committed to their care, is often made productive of"], [303, "287 STATE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE. no small benefit to their families. Very little use is made of any manure except barn dubg, though marl may be had in many places, often without digging* Dung is seldom suffered to remain in heap over the summer, but is taken every spring in a Fresh stute, and either spread over the field aud ploughed in, or laid in small heaps, and put into the holes where Indian com and potatoes are planted. On the lands adjoining to rivers, wheat often yields forty, and sometimes fifty bushels to the acre ; but in common up land, if it produce twenty bushels, it is reckoned profit able, though it often falls short of that. Indian corn will sometimes average thirty or forty ; but it is to be observed, that this latter grain does not produce so largely, nor is it so heavy on new as on old welbcultivated lands, 'lhis, however, is owing much to the lateness of the season in which it is planted ; for if put in the ground as early on the newly burnt land as on the old, it Will be nearly as good. Of all grains, winter-rye thrives best on new lands, and barley or Indian corn on the old, Barley does not suc ceed in new lands> nor is flax raised with any advantage, until the land has been cultivated for some years. The same may be said of oats and pease ; but all sorts of esculent roots are much larger and sweeter in the virgin soil than in any other. The number of cattle is daily increasing, as the country becomes more and more cleared ; and from the upper parts of the state, great herds are driven to the Boston market, from whence the beef is exported. The proportion of horses to neat cattle is very small, the people in general taking no particular care to improve the breed of this use ful animal ; the raising of colts not being: deemed a profit able part of husbandry. Within the last ten years, how ever, great improvement has taken place in this respect ; and the farmers of New Hampshire will probably soon have to boast of as fine horses as any in the neighbouring states. Sheep have greatly multiplied, and are fast in creasing ; being accounted the most profitable stock that can be raised on a farm. Swine are very prolific, and there is scarcely a family without them. During the sum mer, they are either fed on the waste of the dairy and kitcben, or ringed and turned into the fields of clover, or permitted to run at large in the woods, where they pick up nuts and acorns, or grub the roots of fern and other plants; but after harvest they are shut up, and fattened on Indian corn. The pork of New Hampshire is inferior to none in the world. Domestic poultry of all kinds are raised in great plenty and perfection throughout this state."], [304, "288 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA In some of the lower towns they have a large breed or dunghill fowls, which Were imported from England seve ral years since ; but this breed has been permitted to mix With the common sort, by which means it will, in time, degenerate. Civil divisions, population, religion, and character. \u2014 New Hampshire is divided into six counties, having 213 townships* of six miles square each. The names of the counties, with their chief toWns and population, are as follow : \u2014 tTounties. Townxhips. Population. 'Chief Tov)ns. Population. Cheshire 35 40,988.. ... .Keene tp.*.... 1,646 Coos ....24 3,991 Lancaster tp 717 Grafton.. 35 28,462 Haverhill tp... 1,105 Hillsborough48 ..... 49,249......

Smail villages and farm houses are numerous, and the country is pretty well supplied with good roads, and several elegant bridges. Portsmouth is the metropolis of New Hampshire, and its only sea-port. It is considerably the largest town in the State, and is situated about a mile from the sea, on the south side of Piscataqua river. Its harbour is one of the best on the continent, having a sufficient depth of water for vessels of any burden. It is defended against storms by the adjacent land, in such a manner, that ships may eecurely ride there in any season of the year ; nor is it ever frozen, by reason of the strength of the current, and the narrowness of the channel. Besides, the harbour is so Well fortified by nature, that it would require very little art to render it impregnable ; and its vicinity to the sea, renders it very convenient for naval trade. Several ships of war have been built here ; among others, the America, of 74 guns, launched in 1782, and presented by congress * Tb? letters tp. added to the name of a town, signify tbat the population >f tire V_K_e township is given."], [305, "289 STATE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE. to the king of France, At present (1819) there are two 74-gun _hips on the stocks. All the export trade of this state, which is not considerable, centres at Portsmouth; in 1817, it did not amount to quite 200,000 dollars. Concord, the seat of government, is pleasantly situated on the west bank of Merrimack river; and from ils central situation, and a thriving back country, has become a place of considerable importance. A handsome bridge across the Merrimack, connects this town with Pembroke, in the same county. Concord js 57 miles from Portsmouth, 70 from Bostou, and 546 from Washington. Exeter is fourteen miles south-west from Portsmouth, situated at the head ofthe navigation on Swamscot river, a branch of the Piscataqua. Formerly, ship-building was carried on here to a great extent, and the vessels were employed in the West Indian trade; at present it is much decreased, but several manufactures have been established, among which are saddlery, coarse linen, paper, iron, snuff, chocolate* and flour. Here is a celebrated academy, in^ eorporated in 1781, which educates about eighty students; there are besides a respectable English grammar school, and several private schools, chiefly for females. The principal denominations of Christians in New Hampshire are congregationalists, baptists, presbyterians, episcopalians, and quakers. Of these the first are the most numerous, as they are in most of the eastern states; there are also some societies of Sandemonians and Uuiver* salists. Ministers contract with their parishes for their support ; and no parish is obliged to have a minister; but if they make an agreement with one, they are compelled by law to fulfil it. Education has been particularly attend- ed to since the revolution, Dartmouth college, in the township of Hanover, is supported by 80,000 acres of land, and is in a flourishing state ; and, besides the academy at Exeter, there are a number of others, and many schools and public libraries established. In noticing the character of the people of this state, hospitality, firmness, patience in fatigue, intrepidity in danger, and alertness in action, are to be numbered among their native and essential qualities. Land being still easily obtained, and labour of every kind being familiar, there is great encouragement to population. A good husbandman, with the savings of a few years, can purchase new land enough to give his elder sons a settlement. The homestead is generally given to the youngest son, who provides for his parents when age or infirmity incapacitates thete for labour. An unmarried man of thirty years old, is rarely"], [306, "290 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. to be found in the country towns ; and the women are grandmothers at forty. It is very common sor a mother and daughter to have each a child at the breast at the same time ; and for a father, son, and grandson, to be at work together in the same field. Thus, population and cultiva tion proceed together, and a vigorous race of inhabitants grows up, on a soil which labour and nature combines to render productive, ln general, the people are very indus trious, and allow themselves little time for diversion. Where husbandry is the employment ofthe men, domestic manufactures are carried on by the women ; who spin and weave their own flax and wool, and their families are clothed in cloth of their own making. The people of Londonderry, thirty-six miles from Portsmouth, and the towns which are made up of emigrants from it, attend largely to the manufacture of linen cloth and thread, and make great quantities for sale. These people are indus trious, frugal, and extremely hospitable; the men are san guine and robust, the women of lively dispositions; and tbe native white and red complexion of Ireland is not lost in New Hampshire. There are no Indians in this state ; the scattered remains of former tribes retired to Canada many years since. Slaves there are none. Negroes, who were never numerous here, are all free by the first article of the constitution. Trade and manufactures. \u2014 A great part of the surplus produce of this state is carried to Boston, which prevents it from making a great figure in the scale of exports. The staple commodities may be reduced to the following arti cles, viz. ships, lumber, provisions, fish, live stock, pot and pearl ashes, and flax-seed. Most of these articles are carried either to Newbury-port, Salem, Hartford, or Bos ton; particularly to the latter: this arises from New Hampshire being seated in the bosom of Massachusetts, with a narrow strip of sea-coast, and no more than one port. Her inland country extends so widely, as to cover a great part of the neighbouring states, and render a com mercial connection with them absolutely necessary; hence the greater part of her merchandise is reckoned among the exports of those places from whence it is shipped. All the towns which are situate on the southern, and many of those on the western borders of the state, find it more convenient to carry their produce to the ports above named ; while the towns on the river Saco, and the northern parts of Connecticut river, will necessarily com-"], [307, "291 STATE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE. municate with the ports in the eastern division of Massa- chusetts. Therefore to attempt a particular detail of the number and value of articles of commerce produced in New Hampshire, and exported from the various parts of Connecticut and Massachusetts, is altogether impracti- cable. The manufactures of this state are neither numerous, nor carried on to any great amount; ashes, maple-sugar, bricks, pottery, and iron ware may be reckoned among the principal. As masts and naval timber abound in the country, ship-building is still followed to a considerable extent ; both for the merchants service and for govern- ment. The fisheries formerly employed a number of hands, but latterly it has greatly decreased ; though it is still pro- secuted in some parts of the state with tolerable success. Oil is manufactured from the liver of the cod-fish for the use of curriers ; oil is also extracted from a large portion ofthe flax-seed raised by the farmers; the rest is exported. The manufacture of leather and shoes is not so extensive as to produce articles for exportation ; but may be con- sidered among the domestic manufactures. In most ofthe country towns considerable quantities of tow-cloth are made, a part of which is sold for home consumption, and the remainder sent to the southern states to clothe the negroes. Constitution.\u2014 The government of New Hampshire is sounded upon a bill of rights, declaring that all men are born equally free and independent, and that all govern- ment originates with the people ; that every man has a right to worship God according to the dictates of his con- science : that elections ought to be free, and that every inhabitant of the state, properly qualified, has an equal right to elect, and be elected into office : that there shall be no hereditary rights, and that the press shall be fettered with no restrictions. The exercise of the government is vested in a legislature, consisting of a senate and house of representatives ; a governor and council .to execute the laws, and a judiciary to promote justice between man and man. The senate consists of thirteen members, chosen annually by the people ; and the members must be posses- sed of a freehold estate of =\u00a3200 sterling. The representa tives are apportioned according to the population ; every town which has 150 rateable polls being entitled to one' representative ; having 450, they are entitled to two. They are also elected annually, and must be possessed gs so.

History. \u2014 By referring to page 12 of this Work, it will be found that the first settlement of New Hampshire by the the English took place in the year 1621 ; captain John Mason having obtained a grant of certain lands on the feea-coast. The next year, another grant was made to sir F. Georges and Mason jointly, of all she lands between the rivers Merrimack and Sagadahok, extending back to the great lakes of Canada. Under the authority of this grant, in 1623, a settlement was made at Little-harbour, near the mouth of the Piscataqua. ln 1629, some planters from Massachusetts-bay purchas ed from the Indians, for a valuable consideration, a large tract of land between the rivers Piscataqua and Merrimack, drawn at the distance of about thirty miles from the sea coast, and obtained a deed of the same. The same year, Mason procured a new patent of all lands included within lines drawn from the mouths and through the middle of Piscataqua and Merrimack rivers, until sixty miles were completed, and a line crossing over land, connecting those points, together with all islands within five leagues ofthe coast. This tract of land was called New Hampshire, and comprehended the whole of the above-mentioned Indian purchase. In 1635, the Plymouth Company, from whom Mason and Georges had obtained the grants, resigned their charter to the king ; but this resignation did not materially affect the patentees under them, as the several grants to com-> panies and individuals were mostly confirmed, at some subsequent period, by charters from the crown. In 1640, four distinct governments had been formed on the several branches of Piscataqua. The people under these governments, unprotected by England, in conse quence of her own internal distractions, and too much divided in their opinions to form any general plan of fov ernment, thought it is best to solicit the protection of [assachusetts. That goverment readily granted their re quest; and accordingly, in 1641, the principal settlers of Piscataqua, by a formal instrument, resigned the jurisdic-"], [309, "293 STATE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE. tion of the whole to Massachusetts, on condition that the inhabitants should enjoy the same liberties with their own people, and have a court of justice erected among them. The property of the whole patent of Portsmouth, and of one-third that of Dover, and of all the improved lands therein, was reserved to the lords and gentlemen proprie tors and their heirs for ever. These reservations were acceded to on the part of Massachusetts; and, what is extraordinary, a law of Massachusetts, declaring that none but church members should sit in the general court, was dispensed with in their favour. After this union, they had to struggle with many difficulties; one while involved, together with Massachusetts, in a bloody war with the Indians; and repeatedly disturbed with the warm disputes occasioned by the ineffectual efforts of Mason's heirs to recover the property of their ancestor. These disputes continued until 1679, when Mason's claim, though never established in law, was patronized by the crown, and New Hampshire was erected into a separate government. The first commission issued for the government of it was given to Mr. Cutt, as president of the province, on the 18th of September, 1679. In the year 1691, Mason's heirs sold their title to their lands in New England to Samuel Allen, of London, for \u00a32,750. This produced new controversies concerning the property of the lands, which embroiled the province for many years. The year following the purchase, colonel Samuel Allen was commissioned governor of New Hamp- shire ; eight years afterwards he went over to America ta prosecute his claim, but died before the affair was conclu ded. About this time, the inhabitants suffered severely from the barbarity ofthe Indians. Exeter, Dover, and the frontier settlements, were frequently surprised in the night, the houses plundered, and burnt, the men killed and scalp ed, and the women and children either inhumanely mur dered, or led captives into the wilderness. In 1737, a controversy, which had long subsisted be tween the two governments of Massachusetts aud New Hampshire, respecting their divisional line, was heard by commissioners appointed by the crown for that purpose. These commissioners determined that tho northern bound- aries of Massachusetts should be a line three miles north from the river Merrimack, as far as Pantucket falls, then to run west 10\u00b0 north, until it meets New York line. Al- though Massachusetts felt aggrieved by this decision, and attempted several ways to obtain redress, the line has never been altered, but is at present the divisional line between"], [310, "294 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. the two states. Douglas mentions \" that the governor of Massachusetts, for many years, was also governor of New Hampshire, with a distinct commission.\" This must have been many years after New Hampshire had been erected into a separate government In 1679. He adds, \" that New Hampshire entered a complaint to the king in council against the joint governor, relative to settling the bound aries between the two provinces. This complaint was judged by tlie king to have been well founded, and there fore a separate governor for New Hampshire was commis sioned in 1740.\" But although fhis province was nnder the jurisdiction ofthe governor of Massachusetts, yet it had a separate legislature. Its inhabitants ever bore a propor tionable share ofthe expenses and levies in ail enterprises, expeditions, and military exertions, whether planned by the colony or the crown. In every stage ofthe opposition that was made to the encroachments of the British parlia ment, the people, who ever had a high sense of liberty, cheerfully bore their part. At the commencement of hostilities, indeed, while their council was appointed by royal authority, tbeir patriotic ardour was checked by these crown officers ; but when freed from this restraint, they flew eagerly to the American standard, when the voice of their country declared for war, and their troops had a large share ofthe hazard and fatigue, as well as the glory of accomplishing the revolution.

Lakes and riper s. \u2014 Besides lake Champlain, which (separates this state from New York on the west, there are three other lakes of minor importance deserving of notice. Lake Memphremagog, forty miles in length and three wide, lies chiefly in Canada, and communicates with the St. Lawrence by the river St. Francis. Willoughby lake, six miles long and one wide, discharges its waters into Memphremagog by the river Barton. This lake furnishes fish resembling bass, of au excellent flavour, weighing from twenty to thirty pounds. They form a delicious feast for the new settlers ; and people travel twenty miles to procure a winter's stock of this fish. Bombazine lake is situated in the township of Castleton, Rutland county, and is eight miles long. All the rivers in Vermont rise among the Green Mountains ; about thirty-five of them have an easterly direction, and fail into Connecticut river; about Iwenty-five run westerly into Jake Champlain. Two or three running the same course, fall into Hudson's river 5 and four or five ioeiine northerly, and flow into lake Memphremagog. The most considerable rivers on the west side ofthe Green Mountains, are Otter creek, Onion river, La Moille, and Michiscoui. On the east side ofthe mountains the rivers are not so large as those on the west, but they are more numerous. The largest are West river, White river, and Poousoomsuck ; the latter, which is 100 yards wide, and noted for the quantity and quality of its salmon, is settled twenty miles up, and waters some of the best townships in the state. Besides these lakes and rivers, there are several other springs, ponds, and collections of water, which are, in general, remarkably clear, and afford abundance of trout, perch, and other fresh water fish. Mountains, minerals, and curiosities. \u2014 This slate takes its name from a range of high mountains, which, from being covered with pine, spruce, hemlock, and other evergreens, have obtained the appellation of Ver Mons, (Green Mountain,) hence the name of Vermont. They divide the state nearly in the centre between Connecticut river and lake Champlain ; and extending through Massa chusetts and Connecticut, terminate at New Haven; their whole length being not less than 400 miles. These moun tains are generally from fifteen to twenty miles in breadth, and the height of land from twenty to thirty miles distant from the river, and about the same distance from the lake. Kellington Peak, the highest of this range, is about 3,454 feet above the level ofthe ocean, and is sometimes covered With snow till the beginning of June. The Green Moun-"], [312, "296 UNITED STATES OF AMERfCA. tains abound with elegant views and grand scenery, and are interspersed with many beautiful and fertile valleys, finely watered with springs and rivulets. Iron and lead Ores of several kinds; copperas; marble, white, grey, and variegated, in vast quantities ; and pipe-clay, have been fouud in various parts of this state. In the township of Tinmouth, in Rutland county, on the side ofa small hill, is a very curious cave. The chasm at its entrance is about four feet in circumference: enter ing this, you descend 104 feet, and then enter a spacious room, twenty feet in breadth, and 100 in length ; the an gle of descent being about forty-five degrees The roof of this cavern is Composed of rock, through which the water is continually filtering: and the stalactites which hang from the roof, appear like icicles on the eves of houses, and are continually increasing in number and magnitude. The bottom and sides are daily incrusting with spar and other mineral substances; and on the sides of this subter raneous hall are tables, chairs, benches, &c. which appear to have been artificially carved. This richly ornamented room, when illuminated with the candles of the guides, has an enchanting effect upon the eye of the spectator. At the end of this cave is a circular hole of a conical form, fifteen feet deep, ancl at the bottom a spring of fresh water in continual motion, like the boiling of a pot; its depth has never been sounded. Climate, aspect of ihe country, soil, and produce. \u2014 The climate differs little from that of New Hampshire, and is extremely healthy. The earth is generally covered with snow from the middle of December till the end of March ; but the winter season may be said to continue from the beginning of November till the middle of April, during which the inhabitants enjoy a serene sky and a keen cold air. The ground is seldom frozen to any great depth, be fog covered with a great body of snow, in some highlands to the depth of four or five feet, before the severe frosts begin. In this way the earth is enriched and moistened, and in the spring vegetation advances with great rapidity; but .since the country has been cleared and cultivated, the \"vinters are considerably milder, and spring commences sooner: the summer is delightful. The face of the country exhibits very different prospects; b_ general, this state is hilly, but not rocky. Northward fo site Canada boundary, it is flat, and adjoining to the rivers there are the wide extensive plains of a fine level Country, Af a small distance from them, the land rises"], [313, "297 STATE OF VERMONT. into the chain of high mountains already described, inter sected with deep aud long valleys. The heavy growth of timber, which is common throughout the state, evince the strength and fertility ofthe soil ; elm, black birch, maple, ash, and bass wood, grow in the moist low ground, and the banks ofthe rivers are timbered principally with white pine, intermingled with vales of beech, elm, and white oak. For the most part, the soil is deep, and ofa dark colour, rich, moist, warm, and loamy. It bears Indian corn, wheat, rye, barley, and oats, in large quantities, in the proportion of thirty bushels to an acre, as soon as it is cleared of the wood, without any ploughing or prepara tion ; and after the first crops, naturally turns to rich pas ture or meadow. The expenses occasioned by clearing the land, are always covered by the produce of pearl ashes, extracted from the ashes of trees which they burn ; and there are even persons who undertake to clear it on the sole condition of having the pearl-ashes for their labour. This kind of economy, however, seems peculiar to Vermont ; for in all the other eastern states the trees are burnt at a certain loss. Flax is raised in considerable quantities, and latterly, a portion of hemp, for which the soil is well adapted. Potatoes, and all kinds of garden roots and vegetables, grow here in great plenty. Sugar to a large amount, of a good quality and flavour, is manu factured from the sugar-maple. Civil divisions, chief towns, population, religion, and character. \u2014 This state is divided into thirteen counties and 242 townships, which are generally six miles square. Counties. Townships.

In every township is a reserve of two rights of land, of S50 acres each, one to be appropriated to the use ofpublic schools, the other to be given in fee to the first minister who settles in the township. A part of the townships was granted by the government of New Hampshire, and the other by that of Vermont. In those granted by the former, a right of land is reserved for the support of the gospel in foreign parts; in those given by the latter, a college right, and a right for the support of country grammar schools, are reserved, ln these reservations liberal provision is made for the support ofthe gospel, and for the promotion of common and collegiate education. Indeed it appears that the chief object of the legislature of this state has been to provide for the general diffusion of knowledge, by having common schools in every township; a plan highly praiseworthy, and which every community ought lo imitate. The principal body of the people are congregationalists and baptists; the other denominations are for the most part presbyterians and episcopalians. AU the inhabitants are hardy, robust, full-featured, and florid in their complexions ; and as they are chiefly husbandmen and mechanics, they are independent in their sentiments, liberal in their ideas, and hospitable to strangers. Their wants being mostly sup- plied among themselves, they are not subject to great changes of fortune ; but are generally wealthy in propor- tion as they are industrious. With the exception of one settlement of Scotch people, the great bulk ofthe inhabit- ants _re emigrants from Connecticut and Massachusetts, and their descendants ; an active, industrious, hardy, and frugal race. The military strength of this state is truly respectable ; the number of citizens enrolled in the militia being no less than 26,000 ; and the bravery of the \" Green mountain Boys\" has long been proverbial. Trade and manufactures. \u2014 Vermont being an inland country, at a considerable distance from the sea, or as it is sometimes termed, far from a market, contains no large commercial cities ; but there are a great number of small towns, besides those already enumerated, most of which are in a state of progressive improvement. Montpelier, in Jefferson county, 531 miles distant from Washington, is the seat of government for the state ; it is situated on the north-east side of Onionriver, forty-three miles west from Jafca Champlain, and promises to be a place of importance."], [315, "299 STATE OF VERMONT. The only external trade of Vermont is with Canada ; but by means of its rivers, it carries on an extensive commerce with New York, Hartford, and Boston. The articles sent to those places are principally beef, pork, butter, cheese, wheat, flour, iron, nails, pot and pearl ashes, and lumber: the total amount of exports in the year 1817 was 913,000 dollars. ' Nature sesms to have designed this part of the United States to be the seat of flourishing manufactures of every thing that can be made of iron or steel. Immense quanti ties of iron ore are found in several ofthe towns on the west side ofthe Green mountains. Rutland, Pittsford, and Tinmouth, in the county of Rutland, and Shoreham, |n Addison county contain inexhaustible mines of that metal. This ore is easily me}ted, aud produces from one-fourth to one-seventh of iron, which is n)ostJy of the coldshire kind, works without difficulty, and makes excellent nails. A great number of forges and furnaces have been erected, particularly in Rutland, Addison, and Bennington coun ties, fronj which bar iron and nails are manufactured to a great amount. Moss families manufacture the chief part of their own clothing, which is handsome and durable Vast quantities of pot and pearl ashes are made in every part ofthe sta|e ; but one of the most important manufac tories is that of maple sugar. It has been estimated that every family situated on Connecticut river, makes 200 pounds a year ; and that one man in sour weeks can make upwards of five hundred weight, of a quality equal to im ported brown sugar. The planting of maple trees is now becoming general, and in many places the roads are lined with them ; so that in a short time there will be sugar enough not only for home consumption, but also some for exportation. Besides the vast quantity of grain exported, a considerable portion has been lately manufactured into corn spirits; and many stills have been erected, to the great emolument of the owners and injury of the working people. Nothing in the history of Vermont being of sufficient importance to lequire a separate article, tbe account of this state shall be closed with a view of its constitution and government.

Situation, Boundaries, and Extent. Massachusetts Proper, (which, with the district of Maine, constitutes one of the United States of America,) is situated between 41\u00b0 13' and 42\u00b0 52' N. lat. and 3\u00b0 20' and 6\u00b0 55' E. long. It is bounded on the north by New Hampshire and Vermont ; on the south by Connecticut, Rhode Island, and the Atlantic ocean ; on the east by the Atlantic ocean and Massachusetts-bay ; and west by the state of New York. From east to west it is 140 miles iu length, and from north to south seventy miles in breadth. Its square contents is 8,500 miles, being 5,440,000 acres. Rivers, s.ea-coast, capes, and islands. \u2014 Connecticut river, which has been noticed in the description of New Hampshire, passes through the interior of this state, and at Hadley, eighty-seven miles west of Boston, is obstructed by falls, around which canals and locks have been completed. This beautiful river, which rises in the high lands that separates Vermont and New Hampshire from Lower Cana da, runs through a thickly settled country, having upon its banks a great number of the most flourishing and plea sant towns in the United States. The rivers or streams which fall into the Connecticut are numerous ; such of them as are worthy of notice will be found under their re spective names. The Merrimack river, before mentioned, has its course through the north-eastern part of this state* and is navigable for vessels of burden about, twenty mil*, from its mouth at Newbury-port. Charles river rises from a pond near Hopkinton, in this state, and passing through Holliston and Bellingham, the former twenty-eight, the latter thirty miles from Boston, divides Medway from Medfield, Wrentham, and Franklin, all in Norfolk county, thence flows onto Dedham, where, by a. curious bend it"], [318, "302 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. forms a peninsula of 900 acres of land. From Dedham it runs northerly through Newton, passing over romantic falls, and taking its course by Watertown and Cambridge, empties into Boston harbour between Charlestown and Boston. Taunton river is formed by several streams which rise in Plymouth county, and after running a south-west course of about fifty miles, falls into Narraganset-bay, at Tiverton, opposite the north end of Rhode Island. It is navigable for small vessels to the town of Taunton, thirty six mi es from Boston. Concord river is formed of three brauches, one rising from a pond in Middlesex county, the other two from the mountains near Marlborough; it takes its course through Bedford and Bellerica, both in Middlesex, and discharges itself into Merrimack river, at Tewksb lry, twenty-four miles north of Boston. Medford and Mystic rivers run from north to south into Boston har bour ; the latter is navigable three miles to the town of Medford. Ipswich river rises from several springs in Mid dlesex county, and passing through Reading, Middle ton, and Topsfield, enters the ocean at Ipswich, thirty miles north east of Boston. Westfield river rises in Berk shire county, and runs a south-east course through Mid dlefield and Westfield to West Springfield, where it falls into the Connecticut by a mouth about thirty yards wide. Deerfield river takes its rise in Bennington county, Ver mont, and after receiving a number of streams, runs south wardly through Wilmington, Charlemont, and between Shelburn and Conway, passing through a large tract of the finest meadow in the world. Among these meadows it receives Green river, which is about twenty yards wide ; hence they flow together in a broad smooth stream, and enter Connecticut river between the towns of Greenfield and Deerfield, by a mouth eighty yards broad. Neponset river rises from ponds in Norfolk county, and after uniting with other streams, forms a constant supply of water for the numerous mills situated on the river below, until it meets the tide .at Milton, seven miles south of Boston, from whence it is navigable for vessels of 150 tons to Boston-bay. The. only capes of note nn the coast of this state are Cape Ann on the north side of Massachusetts-bay, and Cape Cod on the south. The latter, so called from the amazing quantify of cod-fish which are found on its coast, extends far into the sea, and is remarkable for being the first land which was made by the first settlers of Plymouth on the American coast, in the year 1620. This cape forms Barnstable county, between seventy and eighty miles ife"], [319, "_%___ OF MASSACHUSETTS. 308 length, though the average breadth is not above six miles; the whole county is almost an island. The principal bays on the coast of Massachusetts are Boston, Ipswich, Ply* mouth, Barnstable, and Buzzard's bays. There are several islands dependent on this. state, the principal of which are Nantucket, Martha's Vineyard; and Chabaquaddick. Nantucket lies south of Cape Cod, and is fifteen miles in length and eleven in breadth, with a population of nearly 7,000. The inhabitants are a robust and enterprising race, chiefly seainen and mechanics ; and those employed in the whale fishery are said to be superior to all others ; the island being sandy and barren, is calculated only for such people as are W'illing to depend almost entirely on the ocean for sub sistence. The people are mostly of the society of Friends, and are warmly attached to their island ; few wishing to remove to a mere desirable situation. This island forms a county of itself, by the same name, and is represent ed in the state legislature. Martha's Vineyard, Chaba 'quaddick, and five other small islands adjoining, were discovered in 1602, by Bartholomew Gosnold ; to the latter group he gave the name of Elizabeth isles, in honour of \"queen Elizabeth. The whole now form Duke's county, which is twenty miles in length and four in breadth, and contains 3,290 inhabitants. Edgarton is the chief town, between which and Falmouth on the main land a good ferry is established, the distance being nine miles. The county is full of people, who like their neighbours in Nan tucket, subsist principally by fishing; they also send re presentatives to the general assembly of the state. The other islands of consideration lie in Massachusetts-bay, which is agreeably diversified by about forty of various sizes; several of which are within the jurisdiction of the .own of Boston, and taxed along with it. Mountains, minerals, and curiosities. \u2014 The western part of this state swells out into mountains, some of which are of very considerable height. Wachuset mountain, in Worcester county, is at its top 2,989 feet above the level of the sea, and may be seen in a clear day at the distance of seventy miles. That range of hills which is terminated in New Hampshire by a very high peak called Monadnock, runs through Massachusetts, where it takes the name of mountain. Another ridge rises near Hopkinten."], [320, "304 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. in Middlesex county, and passing north by Watertown and Concord, crosses Merrimack river, and iu New Hampshire swells into several high summits, of which the While mountains are the principal. Several kinds of minerals have been discovered in this state, particularly iron ore, which is found in vast quanti ties in various places, but more especially at Plymouth, forty two miles distant from Boston. Copper ore has been dug at Leverett, in (he county of Hampshire, and at Attleborougb, in Bristol county ; and mines of black lead are worked at Brimfield, in Hampshire, and the neighbouring places. Alum slate, or stone, has been sound in some parts; also ruddle, or red earth, which serves to mark sheep, &c. and is used as a ground colour for priming, instead of Spanish brown. There are marble quarries at Byfield, in the county of Essex, and other places in the state ; and that wonderful production she asbestos, or incombustible cot ton, has likewise been discovered. There ace mineral springs in Essex and Norfolk counties, and at Cambridge; but none of them are much frequented by valetudinarians. In Adams township, Berkshire, is a great natural curio sity. A pretty mill stream, called Hudson's-brook, which rises in Vermont, and falls into Hoosuck river, has, for about eighty yards, formed a channel sixty feet deep, through a quarry of white marble. Over this channel some of the rocks remain, forming a natural bridge, from the top of which to the water is sixty-two feet; its length is about fourteen, and its breadth ten feet. Partly under this bridge, and about ten feet below it, is another, which is wider, but not so long ; for at the east end they foi\u00bbm one body of rock, about twelve feet thick, and under this the water flows. It is evident, from the appearance ofthe rocks, that the water has formerly flowed forty feet at least above its present bed. A little above the bridge is a cave, which has a convenient entrance at the north, and a pas sage out at the east; from the west side of this cave a chasm extends into the hill, but it soon becomes too nar row to pass. Aspect of the country, climate, soil, and produce.\u2014 Massachusetts, like the other New England states, is high and hilly, and the face of the country strikingly diversified. The coast on the east side is indented with bays and inlets, and studded with numerous islands, which afford ample -harbours for shipping, and support a hardy race of sailors"], [321, "305 STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS. and fishermen. Towards the middle of the state the sur face is agreeably uneven, and the whole is well watered with many rivers and springs ; many of the former are of the utmost importance to the inhabitants, by the ready and easy carriage they afford sor their different articles of produce. The climate of Massachusetts is salubrious and healthy ; though the winters are often long and severe, commencing in November, and endiug in March or April ; but of late years, since the country has become more cultivated, a considerable improvement in the seasons has taken place; winter beginning later, and spring earlier than formerly. Towards the west, the winters are colder than on the coast ; but the weather is more steady, and the whole con ducive to health : throughout the state, the spring season is short, the summer and autumn delightful. The soil of this state is extremely various, and may be found from the very worst to the very best. Near the sea coast it is sandy and barren; but in the interior it improves, and in the western parts, where the country is hilly, it is best adapted for grazing. Wheat crops in general are not abundant; but it produces vast quantities of Indian corn, rye, barley, aud oats. The average produce of the good lands, well cultivated, may be taken at forty bushels of Indian corn on an acre, thirty of barley, twenty of wheat, thirty of rye, 100 of potatoes. Vegetables and fruit come to great perfection, and are of much value to the inhabit ants. Apples, pears, peaches, plums, and cherries grow in profusion ; but it has been observed that the effects of the east wind extend farther inland than formerly, and in jure the tender fruits, particularly the peach, and even the more hardy apple. Flax and hemp are cultivated, and hops grow luxuriantly. The counties of Barnstable, Duke's, Nantucket, Bristol, and Plymouth, are, in point of soil, the poorest parts of the state, being generally sandy and light, interspersed, however, with many tracts of ex cellent land. The northern, middle and western districts are certainly much superior ; having, generally speaking, a strong- good soil, very similar to that of New Hampshire and Vermont on one side, and to the soil of Rhode Island and Connecticut on the other. The staple commodities of this state are provisions, timber, ashes, flax-seed, iron, spirits, <fcc.

It stands upon a peninsula of an irregular form, and is joined to the main land by an isthmus on the south end of the town lead ing to Roxbury. It is at one place two miles long, but the- broadest part is not quite half a mile. A great part of the town lies low along the bay, but the ground rises con siderably in the .middle, where the state house is built, which gives it a fine appearance at a distance; and when you approach it from the sea, the view is truly beautiful. The town lies in a circular and pleasingly irregular forpn round the harbour, embellished with spires, above which the .monument on Beacon-hill rises, overtopped by the state-house, situated on an eminence, in the Mall. The prospect from the top of this building cannot be surpass ed \u2014 the bay, with forty islands, the shipping, the town, and the hill and dale scenery for a distance of tbirty miles, present an assemblage of objects really charming. The bridges of Boston merit particular attention, being works of great extent and utility, and constructed at a vast ex pence ; a proof of the sagacity, public spirit, and per severing industry of the people. Charles river bridge * Laid out since last census."], [323, "__a graved \"by J\u00c6JSranlw. Liverpool"], [324, ""], [325, "307 STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS. connects Boston with Charlestown, in Middlesex county, and is 1,500 feet long, forty-two broad, and stands upon seventy-five piers ; it cost the subscribers 50,000 dollars. Maiden bridge, over Mystic river, is upwards of 2,400 feet in length. West bridge stands on 180 piers, and is 3,483 feet long, and forty broad, with a causeway of 3,344 feet more; this bridge connects Boston with Cambridge, and cost 76,700 dollars. They are all built of wood, and the toll is very reasonable. Like most of the old towns in England, Boston is irre gularly built, many of the streets being crooked and nar row ; but the more modern part is regular, and the streets broad and well paved. The streets, lanes, and alleys amount to about 500, and there are five public squares ; none of them of great extent, except the Mall, which is a very elegant piece of ground in front of the state-house. The number of dwelling houses is above 4,000, and by the last census the population amounted to 33,250 ; at present it exceeds 40,000. The greater part of the houses are built of brick,, and many of them are spacious and elegant. The public buildings are the state-house, court-house, concert-hall, Faneuil-hall, alms-house, work-house, bride- well, jail, museum, library, and theatre. There are twenty-four places ofpublic worship ; viz. twelve congre* gationalists (nine of which are said to be Unitarians,) two episcopalian, three baptist, one for blacks, one quaker, one universalist, one Roman catholic, two methodist, and one travelling methodist preachers. These buildings are in general very handsome, and most of the churches are ornamented with spires, clocks, and bells. There being here no peculiar state religion, men may choose to which of the sects they shall belong; but they are compelled to support one of them, and should they neither attend to the worship, nor believe in the doctrine of any of them, the payment must equally be made ; and then it goes to the funds ofthe congregationalist body. The principal societies in the state hold their meetings in this town, and are, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, Massachusetts Historical Society, the Athen\u00e6um, Agricultural Society, Mechanic Society, Marine Society, Charitable Fire Society, Humane Society, Medical Society, Dispensary, and the Female Asylum. Education is upon an excellent footing. There \"are a number of public schools, supported at the expense of the town, which are open to the children of every class of citizens, free of ex pense. They are managed by a committee of twenty-one persons, chosen annually, and are under good regulation.. 2r"], [326, "308 U.MTED STATES OF AMERICA. Besides these, there are many private seminaries, where all the various branches of education are taught; the e.x peuses at one of which is about 100 dollars per annum ; fifty at a be.. English school; thirty-two for a middling do. ; board from two to three dollars per week extra: female education about twelve per cent, cheaper. Upon the whole, Boston may, in this respect, challenge a com petition with any city in Europe, Edinburgh perhaps ex cepted. The fruits of this attention to education are very apparent in the deportment ofthe citizens, who are intel ligent, sober, and industrious ; and though much attached to the subject of religion, they are extremely liberal on that head. The morals of the working classes are exem plary, and very different from what may be observed among the lower orders in the large towns of Europe. This regular conduct arises in a great measure from the comparative state of independence in which they are placed, by receiving a proper remuneration for their labour; and it appears conspicuous by the infrequency of crimes in that large and populous town. At the monthly sessions held in Boston, for May, 1818, there was only owe? criminal who had committed any offence whatever; fhis person, for entering into a merchant's office with a feloni ous intention, was committed to the state, prison for five years. There are no beggars so be, seep in the streets, nor any person that seems distressed ; all are to be found at work, or going to or from their labour ; nor is employ ment difficult to be obtained by industrious and honest men. The markets are well supplied with, abundance of beef, pork, mutton, lamb, veal, and poultry, of a quality equal to any in the world ; and also with meal, butter, cheese, roots, vegetables, and fruits of various kinds, in great plenty. The fish market is. also excellent, and not only furnishes the fobles of the rich with. some. of the greatest dainties, but is also a singular blessing to the poor. The following were, the prices of provisions in the first week of January, 1819: beef from 4\u00a3d. to 7d. per lb.'; pork 5td.to6d.. : veal, the same ; mutton, 4d. fo 6d. ; lamb, 3d. to 4d_ ; poultry, lid. to 13d. each; butter, in tubs, lid. to 12d.; ditto, siesh, 12d. to.Md.; eggs, per dozen, 9d. ; potatoes, per bushel, is. lOd. to 2s. 6d.; cod-fish, haddock, &c. per lb. 2d, ; ditto, per cwt. 9s. ; hay (best) person, twenty dollars; flour, per barrel of 1961b. 10J dollars. Boston is well situated for foreign commerce, of which it has a very large share. The harbour is spacious, and"], [327, "STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS. 309 capable of containing 500 sail of vessels ; and there are above eighty wharfs constructed, one of which, Long wharf, extends into the bay 1,740 feet. The number of vessels that enter and clear out annually is immense, car- rying on a commercial intercourse with all parts of Europe, with the East and West Indies, and China, besides a very extensive coasting trade. The annual exports amount to more than 9,000,000 of dollars, and the tonnage to above 150,000 tons. The principal manufactures of Boston are of iron, leather, paper, and glass, which are brought to great perfection in all the various branches ; they have also thriving manufactures of hats, sailcloth, wool and cot- ton cards, soap, candles, refined sugar, spermaceti, asheSj rum, paper hangings, tobacco, chocolate, &c. &c. ; but one ofthe most important branches is ship-building, as the- inhabitants seem generally more inclined to. tlie shipping trade than to any other. The keel of a line of battle ship is laid, the frame collected, and will be set up in the sum- mer of 1819 ; the frames of another ship of the line and a frigate are also preparing in the same place, where there are large deposits of timber, iron, and copper, for the use ofthe navy. Workmen in any ofthe above trades are ex- tremely well paid for their labour; and from the moderate price of the necessaries of life, live very comfortably. There are in Boston three incorporated banks, besides a branch of the United States bank, whose joint capitals amount to upwards of 3,000,000 dollars, and there are three or four insurance offices, with capitals of 4 or 500,000 dollars each. Taken altogether, Boston is really a fine place, and she state of society is better than at New York. The spirit of aristocracy, however, prevails in a great degree, and dis tinctions are observed to an extent rather inconsistent with a free and popular government ; especially in the town where the revolution originated, which terminated in the independence of America ; a town which gave birth to Dr. Franklin, and a number of other patriots, who were among the most active and influential characters in effect ing that revolution. Here are what they, foolishly enough, call the \" first class, second class, third class,\" and the \" old families :\" titles, also,, are very diffusely and ridicu lously distributed. Boston Was greatly damaged by an earthquake in Octo ber, 1727, and since that time has' suffered severely by numerous fires, in consequence of so many of the houses having been built of wood. The settlement of fhis town took place in the year 163$, by people from Charlestown"], [328, "310 UNITED STATES OF A.MERICA. adjoining ; it was then called Shamut by the Indians, but its new inhabitants gave it the name it now bears, in token of respect to the Rev. Mr. CottoD, a clergyman of Boston, in England, and minister ofthe first church here. Salem, fifteen miles from Boston, is the second town in Massichusetts for wealth and impo; lance, and contains 12,613 inhabitants. The houses are built partly of wood, and partly of brick ; and many of them are very elegant: the principal buildings are a court-house, five congrega tional churches, and one each for quakers and episcopa lians. The inhabitants carry on a very. extensive shipping trade, more business being done here in that line than in any town in the eastern states, Boston excepted. There is a ship-yard at this place, and a considerable manufac tory of sail-cloth ; two banks have been long established. The people of Salem are industrious and uncommonly frugal ; a general plainness and neatness in dress, build ings and equipage, and a certain gravity of manner, dis tinguish them from the citizens of Boston. The melan choly delusion of 1692, respecting uitchcraft, originated in this tow n, in the family of the parish minister ; and here was the principal theatre of the bloody business. At the upper end of the town, at a place called Gallows-hill (from the number of executions, or rather murders, which took place there) the graves of the unhappy sufferers may yet be traced. Worcester, forty-sour miles distant from Boston, is a handsome place, and the largest inland town in the state ; the houses are generally cf wood, painted white, and the number of inhabitants 2,527, who carry on a large inte- rior trade, and manufacture pot and pearl ashes, cotton and linen goods, besides some other articles. Printing in its various branches is carried on very extensively here, by Isaiah Thomas, who, as far back as 1791, carried through his presses two editions of the Bible, the one royal quarto, the other a large folio, with fifty copper- plates, besides many other extensive works. His printing apparatus at that time consisted of ten presses, with types in proportion ; but it has been greatly enlarged since, and is now the largest establishment of the kind in the United States. On the road from Boston to Salem, and nine miles from the former, stands the town of Lynn, containing about 3,000 inhabitants. It is an agreeable place, and celebrated for an extensive manufacture of women's silk and cloth shoes ; more than 400,000 pair having been made here in one year, for home consumption aud ex-"], [329, "311 STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS. portation. Here are two parishes, besides a society of methodists, and a great number of quakers ; provisions and house rent are reasonable, and the workmen receiv ing high wages, live in a very comfortable manner. From hence to Salem the turnpike road is excellent, and was made mostly by emigrants from Ireland, It may not be improper here to observe, that in this country Irishmen are exceedingly useful, and a great part of the labour is performed by them. The Irish labourers are generally strong robust men, without money, and they seldom fail ofg-etting employment in various branches of labour, for which they are well adapted ; and being highly paid for their services, all those who are industrious and frugal, soon become independent and happy. Hence the Irish are remarkable for their attachment to the American government, while many other foreigners, particularly those eugasred in commerce, are discontented and fretful. From this it would appear that the natives of Ireland, who, when at home, are charged with turbulence and disloyalty, require only good usage, and to be treated like men, to form peaceable and loyal subjects; or, is it the mere difference of climate that produces such a salu tary change in their conduct? Let the rulers, or rather misrulers, of unhappy and ill-fated Ireland resolve the question, Charlesfowu, the principal town of Middlesex county, is only separated from Boston by Charles river, and is a handsome place, containing 4,954 inhabitants. It has two places of public worship, viz. an elegant congregational church, and a neat baptist meeting-house ; the other public buildings are, a marine hospital, an alms house, and a state prison, similar to those in Philadelphia and New York, and under equally good management: one ofthe navy yards of the United States is established in tho south-ea . part of the town, and on the north side stands Bunker's-hill, celebrated in the history of the American revolution. Several branches of manufactures are carried on in this town to advantage ; viz. pot and pearl ashes, ship-bnildine, rum, leather in great variety, particularly morocco, silver, tin, brass, and pewter. Cambridge, also in the county of Middlesex, is plea santly situated three miles west of Boston, and contains about 2,000 inhabitants ; the houses are mostly of wood. The public buildings, besides those which belong to Har vard university, are the episcopal and congregational churches, and a fine court-house ; the colleges are four ID number, built of brick, named Harvard, Hollis, aud"], [330, "\u25a0312 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. Massachusetts halls, and Holden chapel : another hall has been lately erected. This is the first literary institu tion in the United States, and has generally upwards of 200 students. Marblehead, four miles distant from Salem, and eighteen from Boston, i. a sea-port, in Essex county, containing above 5,000 inhabitants, who have one episcopal chur-di, two for -con_-regationalists, and one for separatists. The bank fishery employs the principal attention of the in habitants, and more of this business is done here than in any other place in the state. . Newbury-port is likewise a port of entry in the same county, forty miles from Boston, and twenty-two from Portsmouth, New Hampshire. It is a pleasing town, con taining about 6,000 inhabitants, who carry on several manufactures, and have a large shipping trade with the West Indies and the southern states. The churches, six in number, are ornamented with steeples; and the prin cipal part of the people are either congregationalists, episcopalians, or presbyterians. Besides the churches, the other public buildings are, a bank, jail, four school houses, and a court-house; many of the dwelling-houses are elegant. There is a large ship yard here, where a number of vessels are built. Ipswich, ia E^sex county7, is twenty-seven miles north east of Boston, twelve mites south of Newbury-port, and contains 3,569 inhabitants ; it was formerly a place of more importance than at present, which is owing to a barred harbour, and shoals in the river. Some vessels are employed in the fishery, and a few trade to the West Indies; but from the peculiar situation ofthe town, it seems best adapted for extensive manufactures. Silk and thread lace, of an elegant texture, is made here in large quantities, by women and children, and sold for home use and exportation. The inhabitants are chieflv farmers, except those in the compact part of the township. The supreme judicial court, the courts of common pleas and sessions are here held once a year. Concord, a flourishing town in the county of Middlesex, seventeen miles from Boston, contains 1,700 inhabitants, and is situated on Concord river, over which there are three handsome bridges. This town is famous in the history of the revolution, having been the seat of the provincial congress in 1774, and the spot where the first opposition was made to the British troops, on the memo rable 19th of April, 1775. Plymouth, the capital of the county so called, and of"], [331, "STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS. 313 she old colony of that name, is thirty-six miles distant from Boston, and contains 4,228 inhabitants ; the situation of the town is pleasant and healthful, though the easterly winds in spring are often troublesome. The principal business of the place is the cod fishery, in which are employed upwards of 2,000 tons of shipping ; but tbe cheapness of living, the plenty of fuel, and thc numerous mill-seats which are to be found here, will probably render it at some future period, a considerable manu facturing town: at present, domestic manufactures are very general. Patucket, forty miles from Boston, and four north east of Providence, Rhode Island, is a thriving little town, in wbich cotton goods and yarn are manufactured to a con siderable amount, and business carried on with great spirit. The spinning works at this place are on the most approved principle, and were introduced by a gentleman who had been a pupil to sir Richard Arkwright. Here are thirleen cotton manufactories, seven of them small, aud six upon a larger seal. ; but the people employ ed at the whole are not more in number than those at one establishment of a large size in Great Britain. Several of these mills are situated upon a fine fall of water, fifty feet in length, passing through several chasms in a rock which extends across the river : the machinery in them all is ex cellent. Children from six to fen years of age are paid 6s. 9d. a week ; ditto from eleven to sixteen, lOs. ; women, 12s.; men, 31s. 6d. A considerable portion of the weav ing is done by women, who either have or live in farm houses., They receive 3_d. a yard for three quarters wide stout dark gingham; an article which is sold at 13d. wholesale, and 15d. retail. These female weavers do not follow the occupation regularly ; but only when they are not employed at farming ; and at the dull times of the year. Some, who have no other means of support except service (which is despised in America) lodge with farmers, and pay 6s. a week for their board and lodging. The chief articles made at these manufactories are calicoes, ginghame, plain chambrays, and bed ticks ; the latter at a price to completely exclude English cotton tick. The following anecdote recorded by a recent traveller, deserves to be noticed in this place. In September, 1817, the gentleman alluded to visited the manufactories at Patucket, and, while in conversation with one of the proprietors, a well dressed woman came in ; who, from her independent ap pearance, the stranger took to be a customer; in which opinion he was confirmed, when the proprietor said to her,"], [332, "314 UNITED STATES OF A.MERICA. \" I'll attend to you directly.\" She replied, \" I want work, Boss,* for Harriet Angel.\" He immediately called to his assistant, \" Where is that work for miss Angel ?\" \u2014 The writer observes, ' What would a starving Manchester weaveress say to this? and how would sir Robert Peel feel affected, if thus addressed in the true language of honest independence ?' Dedham, the chief town of Norfolk county, is fen miles distant from Boston, on the road leading to Providence, and contains 2,172 inhabitants. The public buildings are a court-house, three congregational, and one episcopal church; the dwelling-houses are mostly of wood and painted white. There are a number of grist and saw-mills in the neighbourhood, and the inhabitants carry on a con siderable manufacture of shoes and wire-work. Northampton, the capital of Hampshire, is situated within abend of Connecticut river, ninety-three miles from Boston, and contains 2,631 inhabitants, who carry on a considerable inland trade. There are in this town a spacious congregational church, a court-house, jail, and about 280 dwelling-houses, many of which are handsome buildings. Taunton, the principal town of Bristol county, is situated thirty-six miles from Boston, and contains between sixty and seventy houses, compactly built, a church, court house, jail, and an academy, incorporated in 1792: the population of the township amounts to 3,907. The chief manufacture in this place is of iron ; which is wrought into spades, shovels, nails, &c. : wire-drawing, and rolling sheet iron for tin are also executed here. There is like wise a manufactory of a species of ochre, into paint of a dark yellow colour. Springfield, the chief town of Hampden county, is situate on Connecticut river, ninety-seven miles from Bos ton, and is a handsome and thriving town, containing 2,767 inhabitants ; who carry on a considerable inland trade, and a respectable manufactory of fire-arms. The public buildings are a congregational church, and a court house ; many of the dwelling-houses are botb commodious and elegant. Brookfield, a post-town in Worcester county, is situated sixty-three miles west of Boston, and nineteen from the town of Worcester; it contains upwards of 3,000 inhabi tants, and is surrounded by a rich fertile country, abound- \u2022 The familiar word Ross is the term used as a substitute for employer, or mas ter, throughout every part of the United States ; the latter appellation being ije tetst., and never applied to any person, whatever may be his situation in life."], [333, "315 STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS. ing in grain, grass, fruits, and vegetables. The great post road from Boston to Washington runs through Brookfield, and the river Quebang, like the other streams and ponds in this township, abounds with various kinds of fish ; the country round contains great quantities of iron ore. There are four places for public worship ; viz. three congrega tional meeting-houses, aud one for baptists. Besides the towns here enumerated there are many others in Massachusetts, in a flourishing condition, to detail the particulars of which would extend this work far beyond its proposed limits. The religion of this commonwealth is established on a most liberal and tolerant plan. All persons of whatever religious profession or sentiments, may worship God agree ably to the dictates of their own consciences, unmolested ; provided they do not disturb the public peace. Matters relating to public worship are managed by each sect in its own way, who are not suffered to interfere with the civil rights of their neighbours ; so that the sting is drawn out ofthe tail ofthe scorpion of religious discord. No sect is elevated above another, and all have reason to be thankful for the blessings they enjoy, in the protection of laws which may truly be called equal. The principal part of the churches are established upon the congregational plan, the rules of church discipline and government of which are, in general, founded upon the Cambridge form, as drawn up by the synod of 1648. The other denominations of Chris tians in this state, according to their numbers, may be classed as follows, viz. baptists, episcopalians, quakers, presbyterians, methodists, and universalists. The condition of society is much the same here as in the other eastern states, with this essential difference from some of them, that slavery is totally abolished in all its branches. The air is, as has been said of the atmosphere of Britain, \"too pure for a slave to live in;\" and, with regard to the white people, some will think it still more pure, for here they are all on an equal footing, having neither nobles, nor inquisitors, nor tythes, nor taxes. The inhabitants are almost universally of English descent, are generally tall, stout, and well built, and glory in possess ing that spirit of freedom which induced their ancestors to leave their native country, and to brave the dangers ofthe ocean, and the hardships of settling in a wilderness. Their education, laws, and situation, serve to inspire them with high notions of liberty, which are preserved and cherished by a law respecting the descent of estates. By this law the possessions of the father are to be equally divided among NO. XIV. 2 s"], [334, "316 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. all the children, excepting the eldest son, who is to have a double portion. In this way is supported that happy mediocrity among the people, which, by inducing econo my and industry, removes from them temptations to luxury, and forms them to habits of sobriety and temperance. This is happily illustrated by the iufrequency of crimes, which were of rare occurrence in Massachusetts, and indeed throughout the United States, before the year 1816, when an increase of emigration from Europe produced a corres ponding increase of business in the criminal courts of America. Offences against the laws are punished very differently in this state from what they are in some others. For grand larceny, the punishment is seven years confine ment in the state prison ; passing bad money, ten years do. ; forgery, three years do. : for this crime a person was convicted in June, 1818, for effacing the words \" three months afler date.\" The militia of Massachusetts is composed of all the able bodied white male citizens from eighteen to forty-five years osage, excepting clergy, schoolmasters, and civil officers ; and is formed into regiments of infantry, cavalry, and artillery: the number returned to the war office for the year 1818 amounted to 70,736 effective men. The great body of these are landholders, aud cultivators of the soil; the former attaches them to their country, and the latter, by making them strong and healthy, enables them to de fend it. The boys are early taught the use of arms, and make the best of soldiers ; nor is there a country upon earth, of equal extent and population, can furnish a more formidable army than this part ofthe Union. Learning is more generally diffused here, among all ranks of people, than in any other part of the globe, aris ing from the excellent establishment of schools in every township ; and a person of mature age, who cannot both read and write, is rarely to be found. According to the constitution, \" every town having fifty householders or upwards, is to be provided with one or more schoolmas ters, to teach children and youth to read and write, ancl instruct them in the English language, arithmetic, and decent behaviour ; and where any town has 200 families, there is also to be a grammar school set up therein, and some discreet person, well instructed in the Latin, Greek, and English languages, procured to keep the same, and be suitably paid by the inhabitants. The penalty for neglect ing of schools in towns of fifty families, \u00a310. ; those of 100 families, \u00a320.; and of 150 families, \u00a330. Another very valuable source of information to the people is the news-"], [335, "317 STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS. papers, of which about three millions are printed annually, and circulated throughout every town and village in this state. Thus, by means of tlie general establishment of schools, the extensive circulation of public journals, and the consequent spread of learning, every township in the country is furnished with men capable of conducting the affairs of their town w ith judgment and discretion. These men are the channels of political information to the lower class of people (if such a class can be said to exist in the United States) where every man thinks himself at least as good as his neighbour, and believes that all men are, or ought to be equal. Comtneree, manufactures, and agriculture. \u2014 The ex- ports of this state are provisions, timber, ashes, nails, flax- seed, bees-wax, fish, oil, saddlery, cabinet-work, boots and shoes, tow cloth, iron utensils, glass, spirits, &c. The imports are British manufactures, tea, wine, silks, spirits, coffee, cotton, &c. Commerce is pursued with an ardent spirit ; and it is said that this state, in conjunction with the district of Maine, owns more than three times as many tons of shipping as any other state in the Union, and more than one-third part of the whole that belongs to the United States. The amount of exports in 1817 was 11,927,997 dollars; but 6,019,581 dollars consisted of foreign produce, and of the remainder, a considerable portion was that of other states, particularly New Hampshire and Vermont. There are very extensive fisheries carried on here, the product of which is annually of great value. The greater part of the manufactures have already been enumerated in the account of Boston ; but it may be observ- ed, that in the interior there is a great variety of domestic manufactures, and several others upon a large scale, par- ticularly of woollen and cotton. It has been already no- ticed, that the cotton manufacture had been successfully introduced at Patucket by an English gentleman, with improved machinery. Several other persons have follow- ed his example, and this branch is likely to increase to at great extent in that district. It has been generally sup- posed that the American manufactures would be unable to cope with the British, on account of the high wages they are obliged to pay to their workmen ; and this supposition is founded on a belief that the people of America have such an attachment to agriculture, as will prevent them from settling at sedentary employments. But upou examining the subject, it will be found that there is no foundation for"], [336, "318 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. this opinion ; throughout the country there is a sufficient proportion of masons, carpenters, smiths, tanners, shoe- makers, hatters, tailors, and other mechanics, none of whom are engaged in agriculture. All these, and many other branches, are practised with persevering industry, because men are well paid sor their labour, and their com- forts are equal to those arising from husbandry. In every community there are many people better adapted sor labour in the house than in the field ; and this remark applies peculiarly to the cotton business, in which a large portion ofthe work is performed by machinery, and a considerable part ofthe remainder by women and children. But labour of all kinds is much better paid for in America than in Britain, the proportion being not less than two to one; and whatever may have been said or written to the con trary, this is actually the case at the present time (1819 ;) therefore, if the cotton trade will afford this advance to the workmen, it will bear a competition with similar manufac tures of Great Britain, and not else. But the most striking circumstance in favour of the cot- ton manufacture, is the cheapness of the raw material, which is the produce of the United States, ln Massachu- setts- they manufacture principally upland cotton, and the price, including carriage, is about Is. 2jd- a pound lower than it can possibly be bought in Great Britain. The next circumstance, is the heavy charges to which British manu- factured goods are subject before they come into the American market. These may be reckoned at least forty- five per cent. ; namely, carriage, insurance, and shipping charges five per cent. ; American duties and importer's profit, twenty-five per cent. ; American merchant's profit and contingencies fifteen per cent. Now supposing lOOlbs. of cotton to be manufactured into cloth that will sell for Is. sterling a yard in Britain, the number of yards will be about 300; and by producing this in the American market, subject to these different charges, we can easily calculate the price that can be obtained by the manufacturer in America ; and from thence we may determine the probable increase ofthe cotton manufacture in that country. ' It is to be observed, that the demand for cotton goods in the United States is immense, and there is no material compe tition except with British manufactures. One bund red lbs. of cotton pu rchased in the south- ern states of America, at 18 cents per lb. is, \u00a34 1 0 Shipping charges, freight, and merchant's profit 1 5 0 British duty 16 8 Nearly 16d. per lb \u00a3 6 12 8"], [337, "319 STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS.

It will be observed by this calculation, that the cotton is taken at its highest price, and for every cent that it falls, the proportional advantage to the American manufacturer is increased : because a great part of the difference consists in duties and charges, which are uot materially affected by the fall. Upon the whole it is evident, that the cotton manufacture will increase in America; and that it holds out a very good inducement for men of capital to embark in it' In this state, particularly in the counties of Plymouth and Bristol, the manufacture of various articles made from iron is carried on to an immense extent ; and furnaces, slitting and rolling-mills, trip-hammer and nail shops are very numerous. Besides these manufacturing establish ments, there are many other branches in iron and steel, viz. cut nails, spades and shovels, saws, oard-leeth, scythes, metal buttons, cannon balls, bells, fire-arms, &c. In these counties are also manufactured hand-bellows, combs, sheet-iron to make tin-plates, wire, linseed-oil, snuff, stone and earthenware. The celebrated iron works called the Federal Furnace, are seven miles from Ply mouth harbour. Massachusetts, generally speaking, is better adapted sot grazing than for grain, though a sufficient quantify of the latter is raised for home consumption ; if we except wheat, which is imported in considerable quantifies from the mid dle and southern states. The high and stony ground is in many places covered with clover, and generally affords the best of pasturage; and here are raised some of the finest cattle in the world, and the quantity of butter and cheese made sor exportation is very great. Moderate size-"], [338, "320 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA ed farms usually contain all the different kinds of land, in varied proportions, and plaster of Paris is used for manure, in the interior ; but it does not succeed near the sea-coast. Arable land in the immediate neighbourhood of Boston, is worth from ,\u00a311 2s 6d to \u00a322 5s Od an acre, farm-house and buildings included : orchards the same price.

There are many wealthy farmers in this state, but generally it is not an occupation by whieh more than a comfortable living can be made : gentlemen who follow agriculture do not make common interest on their money. The more opulent farmers, from twenty to forty miles from Boston, own large pastures, at the distance of fifty or sixty miles from their residence, in the mountainous parts of New Hampshire and Vermont, where cattle and sheep are fattened for the Boston market. Constitution. \u2014 The constitution of Massachusetts, esta blished in 1780, contains a declaration of rights and a frame of government. The declaration asserts the natural freedom and equality of men ; liberty of conscience ; free dom of the press ; trial by jury ; sovereignty and inde pendence ; that all power is derived from the people ; that every man may keep arms, but that standing armies shall not be maintained in time of peace ; that no taxes shall be levied without the consent of the people, &c. &c. By the frame of government, the power of legislation is vested in a senate and house of representatives, styled the general court ; a governor, lieut.-governor, and council. The senators are forty in number, and are elected annu ally in districts; the representatives are also elected an nually, in townships: every corporate town containing 150 rateable polls elect one, those containing 375, elect two ; those containing 600, elect three ; and so on, making 225 the number for every additional representative. Every male inhabitant of twenty-one years of age and upwards,. having a freehold estate in the commonwealth, of the annual income of \u00a33, or any estate of the value of \u00a360, may vote for the senators or representatives. The gover nor is styled his Excellency, and must be possessed of a freehold of \u00a31,000 per annum ; he is elected annually by those qualified to vote for senators and representatives. The lieut.-governor is styled his Honour, and must have"], [339, "321 STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS. the same qualifications, and be elected in the same man ner as the governor. The council consists of nine per sons, chosen from the senators by joint ballot of the senators and representatives. History. \u2014 By referring to page 12 of this Work, it will be seen, that in the year 1628, in consequence of a pur chase trom the New England council, Mr. Endicot plant ed a small colony in Massachusetts,* at the place now called Salem. A few months afterwards, about 200 per* sons, furnished with four ministers, came over and joined this colouy : and the next year they formed themselves into a regular church. This was the first church gathered in Massachusetts, and the second in New England ; the church at Plymouth had been collected eight years before. In 1630, seventeen ships from different ports in Eng land arrived in Massachusetts, with more than 1,500 pas sengers, among whom were many persons Of distinction. Incredible were the hardships they endured, from the cruelty of the Indians, the want of provisions, and other calamities ; so that before the end of the year, 200 of their number were carried off by sickness. About this time settlements were made at Charlestown, Boston, Dorchester, Cambridge, Roxbury, and Medford. The first general court of Massachusetts, was held on tlie 19th of October, 1631, not by representation, but by the free men of the corporation at large ; 109 freemen were admitted at this court. By the resolutions passed on this occasion, the freemen were in future to choose the assist ants, and the latter, from among themselves, were to elect the goyernor and deputy-governor ; the court of assistants to have the power of making laws and appointing officers. At the next general court, in the same year, the freemen passed a most extraordinary law, \" that none but church members should be admitted to their freedom ;\" and this absurd and unjust law continued in force until the dissolu tion of the government. In 1632, and the year following, great additions were made to the colony, and such was the rage for emigration to New England, that the king thougbt fit to issue an order to prevent it. The order, however, was not strictly obeyed, for this year came over Messrs. Cotton, Hooker, and Stone, three ofthe most famous pillars of the church ; Air. Cotton settled at Boston, and the other two at Cam- * The Indian word is, Mois-tchusaeg, signifying the country on this side ihe hills."], [340, "322 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. bridge. Two years after this period, ata meeting of tlie general court, some of the principal inhabitants appeared as representatives of the body of freemen, and resolved, \" That none but the general court had power to make laws, &c. ; that four general courts should be assembled yearly, and not be dissolved without the consent of the majority ; and that the freemen of each plantation had a right to send representatives to the said general court.\" Thus was established the legislative body, which, except reducing the number of court meetings to only two in the year, continued the same as long as the charter lasted. In 1636, Mrs. Hutchinson, a very extraordinary woman, who had joined the colony four years before, made great disturbances in the churches. Two capital errors with which she was charged, were, \" That the Holy Ghost dwells personally in a justified person; and that nothing of sanctification can help to evidence to believers their justification.\" Disputes ran high about the covenant of works and the covenant of grace, and involved both the civil and religious affairs of the colony in great confusion. The result was, that a synod was held at Cambridge, in 1637, which was attended by both ministers and magis- trates ; when, after three weeks disputing, they condemn- ed as erroneous above eighty points or opinions, said to have been maintained by some one or other of the co- lonists. In consequence of this, Mrs. Hutchinson and several of her followers were sentenced to banishment ; and she, with her husband and family, settled at Aquid- nick, Rhode Island, where, in 1642, Mr. Hutchinson died. She afterwards removed to the Dutch colony beyond Newhaven, and next year, she and all her family, being sixteen souls, were murdered by the Indians, except one daughter, who was carried into captivity. The year 1637 was distinguished by the Pequot wars, in which were slain 5 or 600 Indians, and the tribe almost destroyed ; this struck such terror into the natives, that for forty years they never openly attacked the English. The following year was rendered memorable by a very great earthquake throughout New England. In 1640, the importation of settlers ceased ; the motives for emigrating having been removed by a change in the affairs of England. Up to this period, there had arrived in 298 ships, 21,200 pas-sengers, men, women, and child ren ; probably about 4,000 families. It was judged that they had, at this time, 12,000 neat cattle, and 3,000 sheep; the charge of transporting the families and their substance; was computed at \u00a3192,000 sterling. Next year, the ln-"], [341, "323 STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS. dians united under Miantinomo, a leader ofthe Narragan set tribe, for the extirpation of the English ; but the con federacy was fortunately discovered in its infancy, and produced no mischief. In 1646, the colony was disturbed by some of its princi pal inhabitants, who had conceived a dislike to certain of the laws, aud to the government. Several of these disaf fected persons were imprisoned, and the rest compelled to give security for their future good behaviour. Au epide mic disease passed through the country the next year, and swept away many ofthe English, French, and Dutch inha bitants. In 1648, we have the first instance of the infatuation respecting witchcraft, which for some time prevailed in this colony. Margaret Jones, of Charlestown, was accused of having so malignant a quality, as to cause vomiting, deafness, and violent pains, merely by her touch : she was accordingly tried, condemned, and executed ! Happy would it have been, had there been no other instance of this miserable infatuation ; but why should we wonder at the magistrates of New England, when we find the cele brated lord chief-justice Hale, and others of high-rank, in Old England, shortly after, chargeable with as great delu sion. The fact is, that the same spirit prevailed at this time in the mother country, and was brought from thence, as were most of the laws and customs of the first settlers in America. In 1665, a distemper, like that which happened eight years \"before, went through the plantations; but was not attended with a great mortality. In the year following, began what has been generally called the persecution of the Quakers. The first persons who openly professed the principles of this sect in Massachusetts, were Mary Fisher and Ann Austin, who came from the West Indies in July of this year : a few weeks after, nine others arrived from London. Upon the 8th of September, they were brought before the court of assistants, for having affirmed that they were sent by God to reprove the people for their sins. On being questioned how they could make it appear that God sent them ? after pausing for a time, they answered, that they had the same call that Abraham had to go out of his country : to other questions they gave rude and contemptuous answers, which is the reason assigned for committing them to prison. A great number of their books, which they had brought for distribution among the people, were seized and condemned to the fire. Soon after this, on a Sunday, as the governor was 2t"], [342, "324 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. returning from church, in company wish several gentle men, Mary Prince called to him from a window ofthe prison, railing at and reviling him, saying, \" Woe unto thee, thou art an oppressor;\" and denouncing the judg ments of God upon him : not content with this, she wrote a letter to the governor and magistrates, filled with abusive language. The governor then sent for her from the prison to his house, and took much pains to persuade her to desist from such extravagancies. Two of the ministers were present, and with great moderation and tenderness, endeavoured to convince her of her errors ; to which she returned the grossest railings, reproaching them as hirelings, deceivers of the people, Baal's priests, the seed of the serpent, of the brood of Ishmael, and she like. At this time there was no saw for the punishment of the Quakers ; but in virtue of a law which had been made against heresies in general, the court passed sentence of banishment against them all. Afterwards other severe and unjust laws were enacted, among which were the following: \u2014 Any Quaker, after the first conviction, isa man, was to lose one ear, and for the second offence, the other ; a woman fo be each time severely whipped, and the third time, whether man or woman, to have their tongues bored through with a red-hot iron. But, as ever has been, and ever will be the case, religious persecution increased the number of the persecuted. Thus it was with the Quakers ; the spectators first pitied their suffer ings, and then adopted their sentiments, till their grow ing numbers induced the legislature to pass a law, punishing with death all Quakers who should return after banishment. Under this impolitic and tyrannical law, four persons only suffered dentil ; and these had, in the face of prudence as well as of law, returned after having been banished : it may be here added, that it was with reluctance that this unnatural edict was carried into execution. But it must be confessed, that the conduct of some of these infatuated people at this time, w-as such as rendered them proper subjects for a mad-house ; and it is to be lamented that ever any greater severities were used. One or two instances of their behaviour may be mentioned, which clearly manifests a species of madness : \u2014 Thomas Newhouse went into a place of public worship at Boston, with a couple of glass bottles, and while he broke them before the congregation, declared with a loud voice, \u2022' Thus will the Lord break you into pieces.\" Another"], [343, "325 STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS. time, M. Browster came in with her face smeared as black as a coal ; and Deborah Wilson went through the streets of Salem naked as she was born ! While we con- demn the severity with which the Quakers were treated on the one part, we cannot avoid censuring their impru- dent, indelicate, and fanatical conduct on the other. These unhappy disturbances continued, until the friends ofthe Quakers in England interposed, and obtained an order from the king, dated September 9th, 1661, prohibit- ing all capital or corporal punishments of his subjects called Quakers. From this time the Quakers became an orderly, peaceable people, and have been long dis- tinguished for their exemplary morals, benevolence, and attachment to civil and religious liberty ; but particularly for their unwearied exertions to procure the abolition of Negro slavery. In 1660, in consequence of complaints against the colo- nists, Charles II. demanded that agents should be sent by them to answer to the charges. These agents were favour- ably received, and returned with letters from the king, commanding an alteration in some of the laws and cus- toms, and directing the administration of justice to be in future in his name. The king's orders not being strictly obeyed, and new complaints coming to his ears, four commissioners were dispatched to the colony, in 1665, with absolute authority to hear and determine every cause. This new power met with merited opposition, and the commissioners left the country dissatisfied and en- raged. Their report, however, occasioned no trouble from England, on account of the jealousies of govern- ment which then prevailed there ; together with tbe misfor- fortunes of the plague and the fire of London. The colony now attained a more prosperous condition than it had hitherto known ; a spirit of industry and economy pervaded the people, and many of the magistrates and merchants became opulent. The war, commonly called Philip's war, which con tinued several years, occasioned the next disturbances in the colony. The Indians having meditated the general destruction of the English, were numerously engaged in this contest, and muchcruelty was exercised on both sides, uutil a period was put to hostilities by the death of Philip, the Indian chief, in 1676. In the height of the distress occasioned by the war, complaints were renewed in Eng land, which struck at the power of the colonial govern- ment ; an inquiry was instituted, and continued from time to time, till 1684, when judgment was given against the charter-"], [344, "326 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. In 1686, a commissioner arrived, appointing a president and divers gentlemen ofthe council, to take upon them the power of government; but this administration was short, and productive of no grievances. In December, the same year, arrived sir Edmnud Andros, with a commission from king James for the government of New England ; Con r.ecticut, however, was not included in his charge. From his kind professions, the people anticipated much good ; but he soon exhibited his real character, and, together with his council, did many arbitrary acts to the oppression of the inhabitants, and the enrichment of himself and fol lowers. The press was restrained, public thanksgiving, without an order from the crown, was prohibited, fees of all officers were increased, &c. &c. The colony was greatly disquieted by these and similar tyrannical proceed ings ; and when news arrived of the accession of William III. to the throne of England, in 1689, the governor and about fifty others were seized and confined, and afterwards sent home, and the old magistrates reinstated in their offices. The affairs of the colony were now conducted with pru dence, according to the old charter, until 1692, when they received and adopted a new one. This new charter com jyehended all the territory of the old one, together with the colony of New Plymouth, the province of Maine and Nova Scotia, and all the country between the latter pro vince and the river St. Lawrence ; also Elizabeth islands, and the islands of Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard. By the new charter the appointment of the governor was in the crown, and every freeholder of forty shillings sterling a year, and every inhabitant of forty pounds sterl. personal estate, was a voter for representatives. The French of Quebec instigating the Indians, and join ing with them to plunder and kill the English, and the French of -Veadia (now Nova Scotia) infesting the coasts, and taking many vessels, the general court, in the winter of 1689, meditated an attack upon Port Royal, now called Annapolis Royal, and upon Quebec. But the season was so far advanced, the French so superior in number, the weather so tempestuous, and the sickness so great among the soldiers, that this expedition was attended with great loss. While the troops were gone out of the colony, a truce was concluded with the neighbouring Indians; but hostilities were soon renewed. In 1692, the spirit of infatuation respecting witchcraft was again revived in New England, and raged with great violence. Several hundreds were accused, many were"], [345, "327 STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS. condemned, and some executed. That the odium of this tragic conduct may not rest upon the New Englanders alone, it must here be observed, that the same infatuation was at this time current in England. The law by which witches were condemned was a copy ofthe English statute -% and the practice of the courts was regulated by precedents there afforded. In 1711, some ships and soldiers being sent over, the colony troops joined them, and an attempt was made upon Canada, in which the greater part of them perished. This disaster was very grievous to the people of New England, and many persons, in consequence of it, abandoned every expectation of conquering Canada. Frequent excursions on tbe frontiers immediately followed ; but as soon as the peace of Utrecht was known, the Indians of the various tribes requested to be at peace with the English, asked pardon for their breach of former treaties, and engaged for the future to demean themselves as good subjects of Great Britain : articles of a general treaty were drawn up and signed by both parties. But the prospect of a long peace, which this treaty afforded, was interrupted by the plots of one Ralle, a French Jesuit, who instigated the Indians to make fresh incursions on the borders of the colony in 1717; nor was there any real cessation of hostilities until the death of Ralle in 1724. In 1725, a treaty was made with the Indians, and a long peace succeeded it ; but the length of the peace is to be attributed to the favourable acts of government, made soon after its commencement, respecting the Indian trade. About this time, the small pox made great havock in Bos ton and the towns adjacent ; of 5,889 who took the disease in Boston, 844 died. Inoculation was introduced on this occasion, in direct opposition to the minds of the inhabit ants in general ; nor would any of the physicians, except Dr. Boylston, practise the operation. To shew his confi dence of success, he began with his own children and ser vants, and succeeded with them all. Many pious people were struck with horror at the idea, and were of opinion, that if any of his patients should die, he ought to be treated as a murderer. In 1745, according to a proposal and plan ofthe gover nor of this colony, Louisburg, the capital of Cape Breton, was besieged and taken. The possession of this place ap peared necessary for the security of the English fishery, and prevented an attack upon Nova Scotia, which the French had meditated and threatened. The reduction of louisburg by an English colony, surprised Great Britain"], [346, "328 UNITED STATES OF A.MERICA. and France, and occasioned both powers to form import ant plans for the next year. The British government had in view the reduction of Canada, and the expulsion of the French from the northern coutiuent. The French minis try intended tlie recovery of Louisburg, the conquest of Nova Scotia, and the destruction of the English sea-coast from Nova Scotia to Georgia. Great preparations were accordingly made by both nations, aud a very formidable French fleet sailed for the American coast, where a British squadron was long expected to oppose them, but expected in vain. The colonies were now in immediate and immi nent danger; but, fortunately for them, the French fleet was so much damaged by a violent storm, that the ships were obliged to return to France, or retire to the West Indies to refit. By the time the fears of the colonists, which had been excited by the French armament, were removed, the season was too far advanced to prosecute the Canada expedition ; but the inactive prosecution of the war in Europe at this time, on both sides, indicated peace to be near, which in the next year was effected. Here governor Hutchinson ends his history of Massa chusetts, from which the preceding account has been abstracted. Several of the important events which have occurred since that period, may be sound in the history of the United States, between pages 140 and 281 of thib Work;. DISTRICT OF MAINE. Extent, Boundaries, and Situation. The district of Maine is politically connected with the Slate of Massachusetts, and is of considerable extent; being in length, from north to south, 216 miles, and in breadth, from east to west, 162 miles; containing about 31,750 square miles, or 19,720,000 acres, It is situated between 43' 5' and 47\u00b0 45' N. lat. and 5\u00b0 55' and 10\u00b0: E. long. ; and is bounded on the north and north-west by Lower Canada ; south-east, by the Atlantic ocean ; east, by New Brunswick ; and west, by New Hampshire. Bays, lakes, rivers, &c. \u2014 The sea-coast of this district is indented with numerous bays, the principal of which are, Penobscot-bay, in Hancock county, which is abou^"], [347, "329 DISTRICT Of MAt\\_. forty-eight miles wide, and incloses Fox, Haut, Long, and Deer islands, besides a number of small isles and rocks. On a fine peninsula in this bay the British built a fort, and made a settlement, which is now the shire town of the county of Hancock, and is a very commodious place for the lumber trade. Broad-bay is situated about twelve miles westwardly, and lies on the line of Lincoln and Hancock counties ; being bounded by Pleasant-point on the east, and Pemaquid-point on the west, the latter of which projects considerably into the sea. Casco-bay lies between Cape Elizabeth and Cape Small-point, and averages twenty-five miles in width by fourteen in length ; it forms the entrance into Sagadahok river, and has suffi cient depth of water for vessels of any burden. This is a very handsome bay, and contains not less than 300 small islands, some of which are inhabited, and nearly all more or less cultivated ; the land on these islands, and on the opposite coast, being the best sor agriculture of any near the sea-shore of this country. Wells-bay, in York county, lies between Capes Porpoise and Neddick, which are twenty-one miles apart. Besides the bays here de- scribed, there are Saco, Machias, and Passmaquoddy, the latter of which separates the British province of New Brunswick from the United States. The lakes, or rather ponds, are, Sabago pond, twenty miles north-west of Fal- mouth, Massachusetts ; Cobbesconte ponds, in Kennebeck county ; Mousom ponds, in York county, and a few others. The whole interior of the country is watered by many large and small rivers, the principal of which are Penob scot, which empties into the bay of that name, and is navigable to the falls, about forty miles from the sea. It rises from some ponds in the centre of the country, and in its course encloses above sixty islands, making in the whole about 12,000 acres of land. Kennebeck is a fine river, and has two sources, one from lake Megantic, in the highlands, which divides Canada from the United States, the other from Moosehead lake, in Lincoln county, Maine, In its course it receives Sandy river from the west, and Sebastaeook and several others from the east, and passes to the sea by cape Small-point. It is navigable for vessels of 150 tons forty miles from its mouth. Androscoggin river is properly the main western branch of the Kenne beck, and rises in lake Umbagog, New Hampshire ; from thence its course is southerly till it approaches near to the White mountains, from which it receives Moose and Peabody rivers. It then turns to the east and south-east"], [348, "330 U.NITED STATES OF AMERICA. through Maine, and passing within two miles of the sea coast, wheels to the north, and running over Pejepshaeg falls into Merry-meeting bay, forins a junction with the Kennebeck twenty miles from the sea, and 146 from its source. From this bay to the sea, the confluent stream was formerly called Sagadahok. Saco river rises in the White mountains, and running through New Hampshire into Maine, then makes a great bend to the north-east, east, and south-west, nearly surrounding the pleasant town ship of Fryburgh, in York county; its course thence to the sea is about fifty miles north-east. Great and Little Ossapee rivers fall into it from the west, making a great addition to the original stream, on the branches of which, as well as upon the main river, are a great many mills and other valuable works. The Saco is navigable up to the falls, six miles from the sea. Besides these are a number of smaller rivers, among which are, Stevens's, Presumscut, and Royal rivers, all running into Casco-bay. Kennebunk and Mousum rivers extend some distance into the country, and fall into Wells-bay. York river runs up seven or eight miles, and has a tolerable harbour for vessels under 200 tons. Sheepscut is navigable thirty miles, and falls into the ocean at the same mouth with Kennebeck ; on this river is an excellent port called Wiscasset, and at the head of navigation is Newcastle. Pemaquid and Dama riscotta are small rivers ; the former has a beautiful har bour, but is not navigable above its mouth. Climate, face of country, soil and produce. \u2014 The win ters are long and severe, with clear settled weather, which generally continues from the middle of December till the latter end of March; during which time the ponds and fresh water rivers are passable on the ice. There is scarcely any spring season ; the summer is short, and extremely warm ; but autumn is in general pure, healthy, and plea sant. The elevation of the lands, the purity of the air, the limpid streams, which abundantly water this district, and the regularity of the weather, all unite to render this one of the healthiest countries in the world : many of the inhabitants attain tlie age of ninety years. The district of Maine, though an elevated tract of country, cannot be called mountainous ; there being no eminence deserving the name of mountain, except Aga menticus, eight miles from York harbour, which is a noted land-mark for seamen, and a good directory for"], [349, "331 DISTRICT OF MAINE. the entry of Piscataqua harbour. The land on the sea coast, particularly' about Casco-bay, is level 'and sandy, and the soil thin and poor ; but there are many tracts of good land in the interior which produce grain and fruits, aud the country is remarkably well suited for grazing. Throughout this district there is a greater proportion of dead swamps, than in any other part of the eastern states. The tract lying between Passmaquoddy and Penobscot rivers is white pine land, of a strong moist soil, with some mixture of oaks, white ash, birch, and other trees ; and the interior parts are interspersed with beech ridges. The whole of Maine may naturally be considered in three divisions, containing nearly 12,500,000 acres of arable and pasture land. The first, comprehending the tract lying east of Penobscot river, of about 4,500,000 acres ; the second, and best tract, of about 4,000,000 acres, lying between Penobscot and Kennebeck rivers ; the third, which was first settled and is the most populous at present, west of Kennebeck river, comprising also about 4,000,000 acres. The soil of this country, in general, where it is properly fitted to receive the seed, appears to be friendly to the growth of Indian corn, rye, barley, oats, peas, hemp, and flax, as well as to the production of almost all kinds of culinary routs and plants, provided the seed be procured from a more northern climate ; wheat is also grown, but not in large quantities. Hops grow spontaneously; but it is not yet certain whether fruit trees will prosper in the northern and eastern portions ofthe district: in the coun ties of Cumberland and York, apples, pears, plums, peaches, and cherries are plentiful, and much cider and perry is made in the southern and western parts. The inhabitants raise excelleut potatoes in profusion, which are often used as a substitute for bread. The lands, for the most part, are easily cleared, having very little under wood- The natural productions consist of white pine and spruce trees in large quantities, suitable for masts, boards, and shingles, Maple, beech, white and grey oak, and yellow birch, are the growth of this country; the birch is a large tree, used for cabinet work, and takes a polish little inferior to mahogany. The clay lands produce fir, but the timber of this tree is of little use, not even for fuel ; it however yields a balsam that is highly esteemed. Iron, copperas, sulphur, and ochres have been found in several parts of this district, and iron works have been long estae blished, 2 u"], [350, "332 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. Civil divisions, towns, population, religion, and cha racter. \u2014 The district of Maine is divided into eight* coun- ties, and 288 townships, containing 228,705 inhabitants ; being about seven individuals to each square mile.

York, 3,046 Eight. 288 228,705 Portland, the shire town of Cumberland county, is the capital of the district of Maine ; it is situated on a pro montory in Casco-bay, 580 miles from Washington, and 115 from Boston, and was formerly a part of Falmouth, from which it was separated in 1786. It has an excel lent, safe, and capacious harbour, and the inhabitants carry on a considerable foreign trade, build ships, and are largely concerned in the fishery. It is one of the most thriving commercial towns in the commonwealth of Mas sachusetts ; and although three-fourths of it was laid in ashes by the British fleet in 1775, it has since been rebuilt, and is now a place of wealth and importance. Among its public buildings are three churches, two for congre gationalits, and one for episcopalians, and a handsome court-house. York, the chief town of York county, stands upon a river of the same name, and i_ situated 535 miles from Washington, and seventy-five from Boston. The river is navigable for vessels of 250 tons ; but little shipping business is done at present, except that a small fishery is supported. A great variety of fish frequent the rivers and shores near this place, and on a summer evening one may stand upon the rocks of the shore, and catch them in the sea with an angling rod and a yard or two of line. About a mile from the mouth of York river, a wooden bridge has been erected, 272 feet long, exclusive of the \u2022 Since the above division was made, Penobscot county, taken chiefly from the county of Hancock, has been added to the number : Bangor is at present the sent af justice."], [351, "333 DISTRICT OF MAINE. wharfs at each end, and twenty-five feet wide : the model of Charles river bridge, at Boston, was taken from this. Augusta, the chief town of Kennebeck county, has a congregational meeting-house, court-house, and jail, and is pleasantly situated on each side the river Kennebeck, at the head of navigation ; a noble bridge connects the two parts of the town. Wiscasset, formerly Pownalborough, the principal town of Lincoln county, is a port of entry on the west side of Sheepscut river, and is distant from Boston 160 miles. It contains oue congregational church and only about 160 houses i but has a greater navigation, in proportion to its size, aud number of inhabitants, than any port be longing to Massachusetts. A gazette is published here, and the county courts are held in the town : a bank was established in 1802. Machias, the seat of justice in Washington county, is a port of entry, situated on a bay of its own name, twenty mites south-west of Passmaquoddy, the most easterly town of the United States, and is distant 812 miles from Wash ington, and 350 from Boston. It is a thriving place, and carries on a considerable trade to the West Indies and to Boston, in fish, lumber, &c; a regular post between this town and Halifax, in Nova Scotia, has been established. The town is divided into four districts for the support of schools, and into two for the convenience of public worship. In 1792, Washington academy was established here, and is supported by a township of land, granted by the legis lature for that purpose. Bangor, the chief town of the new county of Penobscot, is situated on tlie western side of Penobscot river, thirty seven miles from its mouth, and is distant from Portland 118 miles, and from Boston 240. This, town contains a number of handsome houses, with about 900 inhabitants, and promises to be a place of consequence ; it stands at the head of navigation, and vessels of 200 tons burden may come up to it with safety. Castine, Norridgwock, Paris, Belfast, Berwick, Bidde ford, Scarborough, Wells, and Brunswick, are all con siderable and thriving towns. The latter contains a col lege, which is in a flourishing state, under a president and a professor of languages. In support of this seminary, the legislature has given six townships, and the Hon. J. Bow doin lands and money to the amount of 10,000 dollars: it is called after him Bowdoin College. Brunswick is distant from Washington 608, and from Boston 146 miles. The religion of the people in the district of Maine is"], [352, "334 UNITED STATES O. AM_R!C \\ moderate Calvinism, that is, congregationalists and baptists; although episcopacy was established by their first charter : they are candid, tolerant, and catholic towards those of other persuasions. In their general character there is no difference from that of their neighbours in the adjoining states ; unless they be still more robust and hardy. Placed in the same circumstances, they are like them, a brave, enterprising, industrious, and hospitable people ; and, in general, benevolent and humane. The males are early taught the use of the firelock ; and from the frequent prac tice of fowling, become excellent marksmen. A great majo rity of the inhabitants living in a state of comfortable independence, the traveller is sure to find a home in every dwelling; for their kindness to strangers is proverbial. And as their manners are plain, simple, and unpolished, casual visitors are received and entertained among them with much artless sincerity, and in the true spirit of hospitality. Trade and manufactures. \u2014 The principal exports of this country are various kinds of lumber, such as pine boards, ship timber, and every species of split lumber made from pine and oak, dried fish, and a few other articles ; these are exported from the different ports, in immense quantities. From the first settlement of Maine, about the year 1625, until 1774, the inhabitants followed the lumber trade, which afforded an immediate profit ; but by this means they neglected agriculture, and were under she nece.ssity of importing large quantities of Indian corn and other grain, without which it was then supposed the inabitants could not have subsisted. But the revolu tionary war, by rendering these resources uncertain, taught the people lheir true interest, to wit, the cultiva tion of their lands, which, at a little distance from the sea, are well adapted for raising grain, enough of which is now produced for home consumption. Their wool and flax are very good, and almost every family makes linen and woollen cloth, and farming utensils of all kinds for their own use. The batter made in this district is pre ferred to that made in any of the New England states, owing to the goodness of the grass, which is here very sweet and juicy. Constitution. \u2014 At the time ofthe United States becoming independent, this district was in some measure incorpo rated with Massachusetts, by virtue of a charter from"], [353, "335 DISTRICT OF MAINE. king William and queen Mary, dated in 1692. It has as yet continued in the same connection, and therefore its Constitution is the same with that state; but the separation of Maine from Massachusetts, and its erection into an independent government, have been subjects often publicly discussed by the inhabitants in town meetings, by appoint- ment of the legislature. In February, 1816, in conse- quence of numerous memorials from individuals and townships in the district of Maine, the legislature of Massachusetts directed that the citizens of Maine should assemble in town and district meetings, on the 20th of May, 1816, and give their opiuions, by written yeas and nays, on this question, \"Shall the legislature be re- quested to give its consent to the separation ofthe district of Maine from Massachusetts proper, and to the erection of said district into a separate state ?\" Meetings were accordingly held, and the votes were, for separation, 10,584; against it, 6,491 : total, 17,075. At the same time, the number of legal voters in the district was 37,938. In consequence of this vote, the legislature, by an act of June 20, of the same year, gave its consent to a separation, on certain conditions ; one of which was, that ofthe votes to be again given as before on the ques- tion of separation, on the lst Monday of September, \"a majority of five to four at least,\" should be in favour of separation. The same act provided for the choice, on the same day of September, of delegates to a convention to be held on the last Monday of said month, who were direct ed to sort and count the votes; and if the requisite majo rity should be found, were empowered to form a state constitution. The convention assembled accordingly ; and found the whole number of the votes, excepting some which were irregularly returned, was 22,316; of which 11,969 were for separation, and 10,347 against it. Finding this result, the convention addressed a memorial to the legislature, praying its consent fo a separation ; and then adjourned to the 17th of December. This memorial, with numerous remonstrances, was pre sented to the legislature at its November session, and com mitted to a committee, whose report concluded with the following resolutions : \" That the contingency upon which the consent of Massachusetts was to be given, for the sepa ration of the district of Maine, has not happened : and that the powers of the convention to take any measures tending to that event have ceased. And that it is not expedient for the present general court to adopt any"], [354, "336 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. further measures in regard to the separation of the district of Maine.\" In consequence of the above decision, this important section of the Union stilj remains annexed to Massa chusetts; the people of which are by no means friendly to a separation, as they possess between eight and nine mil lions of acres in the district, which brings annually into their treasury about \u00a3270,000 currency; but from the great extent of Maine, its increasing population, (which, before the last census, had doubled in sixteen years,) and general improvement, there is no doubt of its shortly be coming an independent state, with a separate government. History. \u2014 In the year 1607, an endeavour was made to settle a colony in this country, under captain Popham ; but the measure having failed, no further attempts were made until between the years 1620 and 1630. Six years after this, courts were held at Saco and other places, of which some records are extant ; from these it appears, that the courts acted both in a legislative and a judicial capa city. They proceeded in a summary method, attending more to substance than form, making the laws of England their general rule. In 1635, sir Ferdinando Gorges obtained a grant from the council of Plymouth, of the tract of country between the rivers Piscataqua and Sagadahok, which is the mouth of Kennebeck; and up Kennebeck, so far as to forma square of 120 miles: it is supposed that sir Ferdinando first instituted government in this province. Four years afterwards, he obtained from the crown a charter of the soil and jurisdiction, containing as ample powers, per haps, as the king of England ever granted to any subject. In the same year, he appointed a governor and council, and they administered justice to the settlers until about the year 1647, when, hearing ofthe death of Gorges, they supposed their authority at an end, and the people on the spot unanimously combined, and agreed to be under civil government, and to select their officers annually. Govern ment was administered in this form until 1652, when the inhabitants submitted to the authority of Massachusetts ; the people of which, by a. new construction of their char ter, granted to Rosswell and others, in 1628, claimed the soil and jurisdiction of the province of Maine, as far as the middle of Casco-bay. Maine then first took the name of Yorkshire, countyT courts were held in the same man ner as in Massachusetts, and the towns had liberty to send their deputies to the general court at Boston."], [355, "337 DISTRICT OF MAINE. In 1664, Charles II. granted to his brother, the duke of York, all that part of New England which lies between St. Croix and Pemaquid rivers, on the sea-coast, and up Pemaquid river, and from the head thereof to Kennebeck river, and thence the shortest course to the St. Lawrence; this was called the duke of York's property, and annexed to the government of New York. The duke, on the death of his brother, became James II. and upon James's abdi cation, these lands reverted to the crown. Upon the re storation of Charles II. , the heirs of sir Ferdinando Gorges complained to the British government of the Massachusetts usurpation ; and in 1665 the king's com missioners, who visited New England, came to the pro vince of Maine, and appointed magistrates and other officers, independent of Massachusetts. The magistrates, thus appointed, administered government until about the year 1668, when the Massachusetts general court sent down commissioners, and opposed the authority of the king's officers. At this time public affairs were in great confusion, some declaring for the heirs of Gorges and the king's magistrates, and others for Massachusetts ; the latter, however, prevailed, and courts of pleas and criminal matters were held as in other parts of Massachusetts. About the year 1674, the heirs of Gorges complained again to the king and council of the usurpation of Massa chusetts, and the rulers of that province were called upon to answer for their conduct. The result was, they ceased for a time to exercise their jurisdiction, and Gorges, grandson of Ferdinando, sent over instructions. But in 1677, the people of Massachusetts, by their agent, John Usher, Esq. purchased the right and interest ofthe patent for \u00a31,200 sterling. They now supposed that they had both the jurisdiction and the soil, and therefore governed according to the charter of Maine until 1684, when the Massachusetts charter was vacated. In 1691, by charter from William and Mary, the province of Maine, and the large territory eastward, bordering on Nova Scotia, was incorporated with Massachusetts. This country, from its first settlement, has been greatly harassed by the Indians; in the year 1675, all the settle nients were in a manner broken up and destroyed. From about 1692 till 1702, was one continued scene of killing, burning, and destroying; and the inhabitants suffered much for several years preceding and following the year 1724. Even so late as 1748, persons were killed and cap tivated by the Indians in many of the towns next the sea. Since this period, the inhabitants have lived unmolested,"], [356, "338 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. and all danger of Indian warfare is for ever at an end. Few parts of the Union are in a more rapid state of improvement than the district of Maine ; public roads have been opened throughout the country, agriculture is well attended to, and cattle are raised in great numbers. The population has increased so rapidly within the last thirty years, and such is the growing importance of the people, that their political separation from Massachusetts is an event that may be daily expected. STATE OF RHODE ISLAND, Situation, Boundaries, and Extent. Rhode Island, the smallest of the United States, is situated between 41\u00b0 22' and 42\u00b0 N. lat. aud 5\u00b0 and 5\u00b0 50' E. long. It is bounded on the north and east by Massa chusetts ; south, by the Atlantic ocean ; and west, by Connecticut ; these limits comprehend what is called Rhode Island and Providence plantations, which together constitute the state of Rhode Island. Its greatest length from north to south is forty-eight, and its greatest breadth from east to west forty-two miles ; forming au area of 1,500 square miles, or 960,000 acres. Bays, harbours, islands, and rivers. \u2014 Narraganset-bay runs up from soutb to nortb between the main land on the east and west, and encompasses many beautiful and fertile islands; the principal of which are Rhode Island, Canoni cut, Prudence, Patience, Hope, Dyer's, and Hog islands. The chief harbours of this state are Newport, Wickford, Warren, Bristol, and Greenwich, besides Providence and Patuxet, the latter is near the mouth of Patuxet river, which falls into Providence river. This fine bay, which affords a great variety of fish, with abundance of oysters and lobsters, is thirty-three miles in length, and, towards Newport, about twelve in breadth ; its banks are covered with handsome settlements,, and there are a number of pretty little towns, the view of which from the water has a most pleasing effect. Rhode Island is thirteen miles long and four miles wide, and is divided into three townships, Newport, Portsmouth, and Middleton. Perhaps no island in the world exceeds this in point of soil, climate, and situation ; and it is celebrated for its beautiful women. In"], [357, "339 STATE OF RHODE ISLAND. its most flourishing state, it was called by travellers the Eden of America; but the change which the revolutionary war, and a subsequent decrease of trade have effected, is great indeed. Canonicut lies about three miles west of Newport, and is seven miles in length and oue iu breadth ; the soil is luxuriant, producing grain and grass in abund ance. Prudence island is nearly as large as Canonicut, and lies north of it in Narraganset-bay ; it belongs to the town of Portsmouth, in Newport countyT, Rhode Island. Patience island, also in the same bay, lies a mite south-east of Warwick Neck, aud is about two miles long and one broad. Hope, Dyer's, and Hog islands are too small to merit a particular description. Providence river, which falls into Narraganset-bay, rises by several branches, part of which come from Massa chusetts. It is navigable as far as Providence, thirty miles from the sea, for vessels of 900 tons burden, and affords fine fish, oysters, and lobsters. Taunton river is formed by several streams which rise in Plymouth county, Massachu setts; it falls into Narraganset-bay at Tiverton, after a course of about fifty miles, and is navigable for small ves sels as far as Taunton. Patucket, or Blackstone's river, empties into Seekhonk river, four miles from Providence ; over it are two bridges, connecting Rhode Island with the state of Massachusetts. In this river is a beautiful fall of water, which in its whole length is upwards of fifty feet ; the water passes through several chasms in a rock which runs directly across the bed of the stream, and serves as a dam : several mills have been erected upon these falls. Wanaspatucket river falls into the bay a mile and a half north-west of Weybosset bridge, and Moshasuck river flows into the same bay, three quarters of a mile north of the bridge; these rivers united form Providence river, which, a few miles below the town, receives the name of Narraganset-bay. There is but one mountain in this state, and this is in the county of Bristol, called Mount Hope ; there is nothing in the appearance of this mountain to claim particular atten tion. Iron ore is found here in great plenty, and the country abounds with limestone and marble ; large quan tities of lime are made and exported. Some copper ore and loadstone have also been found, and there are several mineral springs, but of no great importance ; though there is one near Providence to which many people resort. Climate, face of the country, soil, and produce. \u2014 The climate is in many respects similar to that of Massachusetts. no. xv. 2 x"], [358, "340 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. The winters, in the maritime parts of the state-, are milder than in the inland country ; the air being softened by a sea vapour, which also enriches the soil. The summers are delightful, especially on Rhode Island, where the ex treme heats which prevail in other parts of the Atlantic states are allayed by cool and refreshing breezes from the sea. The face of the country is finely variegated by hill and dale, aud the state is intersected in all directions by rivers and bays, which swarm w7ith fish, to the amount of seventy different kinds, so that the markets may be said to be alive with them. The soil is various, and a great part of it good ; though better adapted for grazing than for grain. The north western parts of the state are but thinly inhabited, being rocky and barren ; but the tract of land lying between North and South Kingston on the east, and Connecticut on the west, is excellent pasture land, aud is inhabited by a number of wealthy farmers, who raise some of the finest neat cattle in America, 'lhey keep large dairies, and make butter aud ciieese of superior quality, and in large quantities tor exportation ; the cheese is sold from 5d. to t)fu. a pound, wholesale. Farms contain from ten to 200 acres, and as the inhabitants of the country are generally proprietors ofthe farms they cultivate, and having neither landlord to grind them, nor rent to pay, they live inde pendent and happy. The lands are not entailed, and hence there is no aristocracy ; but independence is easily obtained by labour. The ground is well cultivated, and produces Indian corn, rye, barley, oats, wheat (though not enough for home consumption) fruits in great abund ance, and a profusion of vegetables. Narraganset has been long celebrated for a fine breed of pacing horses, remarkable for their speed and hardi ness, and for enduring the fatigues of a journey. The people of this state, and indeed throughout New England, are for the most part native Americans ; emigrants from Europe scarcely ever think of settling in the eastern parts ofthe Union: indeed, that portion of the country which we are now describing has been so long inhabited, and is so well occupied, as to offer little encouragement to foreigners. Civil divisions, towns, population, religion, &c. \u2014 This state is divided into five counties, which are subdivided into thirty-one townships, containing 76,931 inhabitants, being about fifty-one to each square mile."], [359, "341 STATE OF RHODE ISLAND.

The former is situated on the south-west point of Rhode Island, five miles from the sea, and has one of the finest harbours in the world, in which a large fleet may ride in perfect safety. The town extends about a mile from north to south along Narraganset-bay, and is about one-third of a mile in breadth, rising as it proceeds from the water by a con- siderable ascent ; the streets cross one another at right angles, and are all well paved. The number of dwelling houses is about 1,200, chiefly built of wood, and painted white ; and there are ten houses for public worship, viz. four for baptists, two for congregationalists, aud one each for episcopalians, quakers, Moravians, and Jews : the other public buildings are a state-house, academy, and library. The academy is under the direction ofa rector and tutors, who teach the learned languages, English grammar, geo- graphy, &c. The situation of this city is beautiful, and the healthi- ness of the climate proverbial ; in consequence of which it has become a great resort for strangers, particularly from the southern states, during the summer season. It is no less remarkable for the great variety, and excellent quality, of fresh fish which the market furnishes at all seasons of the year ; no less than fifty or sixty different kinds may be seen here exposed to sale. The excellent accommodations and regulations of the numerous packets which sail regularly between this place and New York and Providence, are deserving of particular notice. They are under the best management, and afford superior con- venienceand cheaper travelling than is to be found in most parts of the world. The distance from hence to New York is about 200 miles, the passage to which is generally made in thirty hours, and the fare, including bed and pro visions, is only nine dollars ; from hence to Providence, thirty miles, it is one dollar. The trade of Newport is principally in shipping; and there i$ a manufactory of cot ton and one of duck, both of which are prospering."], [360, "342 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. Providence is delightfully-situated at the head of Narra ganset-bay, thirty-five mites from the sea, and stands on both sides of Providence river ; the two parts of the town being connected by a bridge 160 feet long by 22 wide: the west side of the town lies low, but the east side rises I v a rapid ascent to a considerable elevation. The public buildings arc a handsome court-house, market-house, a school-house, in which four schools are kept, an hospital, and five places for public worship ; viz. three congrega tional churches, and one each for baptists and quakers. Rhode Island college is established in this town, and is si tuated on a hill, commanding a fine prospect ofthe town, bay, shipping, and country for many miles round. The building is of brick, 150 feet long, forty-six wide, and four stories high, and contains lodgings for upwards of 100 students; it has a valuable philosophical apparatus, and a library containing above 3,000 volumes. Provi dence has a pretty extensive shipping trade, and carries on considerable mercantile business with Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Vermont ; several large manufactories are established in the town and neighbourhood, particu larly of cotton and linen, which are in a flourishing con dition. Besides these, there are two spermaceti works, a number of distilleries, sugar-houses, and other manu facturing esteblishments, all in a very prosperous state ; mechanics of every description, particularly ship and house carpenters, are in full occupation, and highly paid for their labour, and rent and provisions are much lower here, and throughout this state, than they are at New York. Bristol is a pleasant thriving town, situated on the bay, about half way between Providence and Newport, and is a charming place for situation, healthful climate, rich soil, and a commodious, safe harbour. This town suffered greatly during the revolutionary war, a great part of it having been destroyed by the British ; but it is now in a very flourishing state, and has a good shipping trade : onions in great quantities, and a variety of provisions and garden roots are raised here for exportation. Warren is a flourishing little town, situated four miles north of Bristol, and ten south-east of Providence ; it carries on a brisk coasting and foreign trade, and is re markable for ship building. Rhode Island college \"was first instituted in this town, and afterwards removed to Providence. The other towns of any note in this state are South Kingston, Warwick, East Greenwich, and Little Compton ;"], [361, "343 STATE OF RHODE ISLAND. the latter is situated in Newport county, and is said to be the best cultivated township in the state, affording greater quantities of meat, butter, cheese, vegetables, <&c. than any other town of its size. The inhabitants are very indus trious, and manufacture linen cloth, flannels, &c. of an excellent quality, and in considerable quantity for sale. The constitution of this state admits of no religious establishments, any farther than depends upon the volun tary choice of individuals. All men professing the Supreme Being, are equally protected by the laws, and no particular sect can claim pre-eminence ; this unlimited liberty in religion is one principal cause why there is such a variety of religious sects in Rhode Island. The baptists are the most numerous of any denomination in the state ; they are chiefly upon the Calvinistic plan as to doctrines, and independents in regard to church government. There are, however, some who profess the Arminian tenets, and others who observe the Jewish sabbath ; these are called Sabbatarian, or seventh-day baptists. The other religious sects in Rhode Island are, congregationalists, quakers, episcopalians, Moravians, and Jews; besides these, there are many of the people who make no external profes sion of any religion, nor attend to any place of public worship. The character of the citizens of this state has suffered severely in consequence of their transactions in paper money; and the history of their government for seventy years, commencing with 1710, presents little else than a scene of peculation, and fraud. The vast sums created in this manner were not for the purpose of commerce, but to supply the state with money, and to fill the pockets of mercenary individuals, who were too idle and profligate to acquire property by industry. This swindling trans action was so managed, that the money was raised at about two and a half per cent , and lent to the neighbouring colonies at ten per cent. ; one quarter of the interest went to the several townships to defray their charges, and the other three quarters were applied to the use of govern ment ; so that both the rulers and the people were con cerned in this iniquitous public fraud. These scandalous measures deprived the state of great numbers of its most respectable inhabitants ; had a most pernicious influence upon the morals of the people, defrauded the widow and the orphan of their just dues, and occasioned a ruinous stagnation of trade. Such was the state of affairs in Rhode Island for a long period ; but a better government having effectually abolished this infamous system, the"], [362, "344 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. character of both governors and people has been retrieved by integrity of conduct ; and the attention now paid to the principles of the rising generation, gives a pleasing assurance that a total reformation in public morals will soon be apparent throughout she state. Through the whole of the war which established American indepen dence, the people of Rhode Island evinced a most patriotic spirit ; the citizens in arms fought with great gallantry, and the second general in the field (Greene) was brought up among them. A respectable military force is still kept up by this small state ; the return of militia for the year 1818, amounted to 8,350 effective men. Trade and manus ac tures. \u2014 While Rhode Island remain- ed a British colony, its principal commerce was the impor- tation of dry goods from Great Britain, slaves from Africa, sugar, coffee, and molasses from the, West Indies, and lumber and provisions from the neighbouring colonies. With the bills which they obtained in the West Indies, theyT paid the English merchants; their sugars they sold in Holland ; the slaves, lumber, and provisions, they car- ried to the West Indies ; the rum distilled from the molasses was sent to Africa to purchase negroes ; and with the dry goods from England they traded with the neighbouring colonies. By this kind of commerce they subsisted, and many of them grew rich ; but the war of the revolution, and other occurrences already stated, greatly injured their trade, the principal part of which was for a long time carried on by the flourishing towns of Providence and Newport : both these towns, with a few others, strenuously opposed the nefarious paper money system. At present, the whole state has a very considerable foreign commerce, exporting grain, flax-seed, lumber, horses, cattle, beef, pork, fish, poultry, butter, cheese, onions, spirits, and cotton and linen goods ; the total value of exports for one year, ending the Sth of September, 1817, amounted fo 9.0,467 dollars; in 1791, it was only 470,000 dollars. The imports are European and India manufactures, West India produce, and logwood from Honduras. The manufactures are cottons and linens to a very con- siderable and increasing amount ; bar and sheet iron, steel, nails, anchors and other iron work for shipping, sailcloth, paper, rum, &c. The cotton manufacture in particular is extending, and some of those engaged in it have been yery successful ; but it is yet in its infancy, and being sub ject to a competition with the long-established manufac-\u00ab"], [363, "345 STATE OF RHODE ISLAND. tures of Britain, it must for some time labour under diffi culties. The other manufactures of this state are choco late, wool and cotton cards, bells, &c. ; besides domestic manufactures for family use, which in tbis, as in the other states, amount to a vast sum, which cannot be ascertained. Constitution. \u2014 The constitution of this state is founded on the charter granted by Charles II., in 1663, and the frame of government was not essentially altered by there volution. The legislature consists of two branches; a senate, or upper house, composed of ten members, called in the charter \"assistants;\" and a house of representa tives, composed of deputies from the several townships. The members of the legislature are chosen twice a year, by all the freemen -of the state ; and there are two sessions of this body annually, in May and October. The supreme executive power is vested in a governor, or, in his absence, in the deputy-governor, who are chosen annually, in May, by the suffrages of the people ; the governor presides in the upper house, but has only a single voice in enacting laws. There is one supreme judicial court, composed of five judges, whose jurisdiction extends over the whole state, and who hold two courts annually in each county. Besides these, there is an inferior court of common pleas and general sessions of the peace, held twice a year in each shire town, for the trial of causes not capital, arising within the county, from which an appeal lies to the supreme court. The justices of the peace, as in other states, have cognizance of small causes ; and since the revolution their powers have been enlarged to an uncom mon, if not to a dangerous extent. History. \u2014 This state was first settled from Massachusetts ; from whence Mr. Roger Williams, a minister, who came over to Salem, in 1630, was banished by religious perse cution. Governor Winthrop advised him to pursue his course to Nehiganset, or Narraganset-bay, which he did, and fixed himself at Seekhonk, now Rehoboth. But this place being within the bounds of the Plymouth colony, governor Winslow, in a friendly manner, advised him to remove to the other side of the river, where the lands were not covered by any patent. Accordingly, in 1635, Mr. Williams and a few others crossed Seekhonk river, and landed among the Indians, by whom they were hospitably received, and thus laid the foundation of a town,"], [364, "346 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, which, from a sense of God's merciful goodness to him, he named Providence. The whole colony of Massachusetts, at this time, was in a violent ferment from religious disputes. Accordingly, a synod was called, in August, 1636, which condemned eighty erroneous opinions ; and a court holden two months afterwards at the same place, banished some ofthe leading persons who were accused of these supposed errors, and censured several others ; principally, it ap pears, sor seditious conduct. Those who were banished by the court, joined by a number of their friends, went in quest of a new settlement, and eame to Providence, where they were kindly entertained by Mr. Williams, who, by the assistance of sir Henry Vane, jun. procured for them, from the Indians, Aquidnick, now Rhode Island. Here, in 1638, the people, only eighteen in number, formed themselves into a body politic, and chose Mr. Coddington, their leader, to be their judge or chief magistrate ; the other parts of the state were purchased of the natives at several succe.ssive periods. In the year 1643, the people being destitute ofa patent, or any legal authority, Mr. Williams went to England as agent, and obtained a free and absolute charter of civil incorporation, by the name of the \" Incorporation of Providence plantations in Narraganset-bay.\" This lasted until the charter was granted by Charles II., by which the incorporation was styled \" The English colony of Rhode Island and Providence plantations in New England.\" This charter, without any essential alteration, has remained the foundation of their government ever since. Mr. Wil liams is said to have become a baptist in a few years after his settling at Providence, and to have formed a church of that persuasion; which, in 1653, disagreed about the right of laying on hands; some maintaining that it was necessary to church communion, and others holding it indifferent; upon which the church was divided into two parts. At Newport Mr. J. Clarke and some others formed a church in 1664, on the principles of the baptists; which church was afterwards divided like that of Providence. In 1720, there was a congregational church gathered at Newport ; and out of this church another was formed in 1728. The worship of God, according to the rites ofthe church of England, was instituted here in 1706, by the society for propagating the gospel in foreign parts ; and in 1738, there were seven worshipping assemblies in this town, and a large society of quakers at Portsmouth, at the other eud of the island."], [365, "347 .STATE OF CONNECTICUT. In 1730, the colony was silled with inhabitants, chiefly by the natural increase of the first settlers ; the number of souls in the state at this time was 17,935; of which no more than 985 were Indians, and 1,648 negroes: eight years afterwards, there were above 100 sail of vessels be longing to the town of Newport. Rhode Island, from its local situation, has ever been less exposed to the incursions of the Indians, and to the French, when masters of Canada, than either Massachu setts or Connecticut. Many of the colonists have, from its first establishment, professed the principles of the quakers, which forbade them to fight ; for these reasons, the colony was very little concerned in the old wars with the French and Indians. In the expedition against Port Royal, in 1710, and in the unsuccessful attempt against Canada the year following, they had some forces. To wards the intended expedition against Canada, in 1746, they raised 300 men, and equipped a sloop of war with 100 seamen ; but in their voyage to Nova Scotia, they met with misfortunes and returned : soon after, the design was entirely dropped. From this period nothing occurred in the affairs of Rhode Island deserving particular notice, until the memorable epoch when the American colonies determined to oppose the authority of the mother country; from which time the history of that state becomes in a great measure identified with that of the other sections of the Union. STATE OF CONNECTICUT. Situation, Boundaries, and Extent. Connecticut is situated between 41\u00b0 and 42\u00b0 N. lat. and 3\u00b0 20' and 5\u00b0 E. long. It is bounded on the north by Massachusetts ; south, by the Sound, which separates it from Long Island ; east, by Rhode Island ; and west, by the state of New York. Its length, from north to south, is fifty miles ; and its breadth from east to west, eighty miles ; forming an area of 4,000 square miles, or 2,560,000 acres. Rivers and harbours. \u2014 The principal rivers in this state are, Connecticut, described under Massachusetts ; it falls into Long Island sound between the towns of Saybrook 2 Y"], [366, "348 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. and Lyme. An elegant bridge has been lately erected over this fine river, connecting the towns of Hadley and North ampton, in the state of Massachusetts. It is l,ObO feet in length, and thirty in width, aud supported by nine piers; elevation thirty feet above high water mark.* Housato nick river rises in Berkshire county, Massachusetts, and after running a south-east course the whole breadth ofthe state of Connecticut, and passing through several pleasant and thriving towns, empties into the Sound between Stratford and Milford. It is navigable twelve miles to Derby, and above that town is very important for mills and machinery ; but a bar of shells at its mouth, obstructs the navigation of large vessels. Just above the bridge which connects the towns of Canaan and Salisbury, the whole water of the river, 225 feet wide, falls about sixty feet perpendicular, in a perfect white sheet, and, when the river is full, presents a scene truly grand and beautiful. Naugatuk is a small river which flows into the Housa ionick, at Derby ; a great number of mills and iron works are upon this stream and its branches. Farmington river rises in Massachusetts, and runs south-easterly through Hartland, Barkhampstead, and New Hartford, all in Con necticut, to the town -of Farmington, where, meeting with mountains, it terns northerly in search of a passage, and after running fifteen miles it meets with Salmon river, when the confluent stream .rushes through the mountain, and idown a cataract of 150 feet, after which it is called Windsor river, and continuing a south-east course, falls into Connecticut river four miles above Hartford. Thames river is formed by the junction of Shetucket and Norwich rivers, at the oity of Norwich, to which place it is navi gable for three-mast vessels, and thus far the tide flows. From thence it takes a -southerly course fourteen miles, passing by New London, and flows into Long Island sound, forming the fine harbour of New London. About a mile from the mouth of Norwich river there is a very romantic and remarkable cataract ; and at the entrance of Shetucket river is a bridge of timber 124 feet in length. Paukatuk is a small river which empties into Stonington harbour, and forms a part of the division line between Connecticut and Rhode Island. East, or North-haven river, rises about twenty miles south-west of Hartford, and passing through Wallingford and North-haven, falls into Newhaven harbour. Byram river is a small stream, no otherwise remarkable than as forming part of the \u2022western boundary of 'Connecticut. * The. account of this bridge .as received too late to appear in its proper place."], [367, "349 STATE OF CONNECTICUT. The whole of the sea-coast is indented with harbours, many of which are safe and commodious ; but those of New London and Newhaven are the most important. The former opens to the south, and is large, convenient, and dangerless ; it has from five to six fathoms water, with a clear bottom, and for a mile above the town is entirely secure for large ships : from the light-house which stands at the mouth of the harbour, up to the town, is about three miles. Newhaven harbour, though inferior to New London, has good anchorage with twenty-two feet water at common tides, and fifteen feet at low water ; it is a bay which runs in northerly from the Sound about four miles, with an entrance half a mile wide. Face of the country, climate, soil, and produce. \u2014 In Connecticut the face of the country is pleasingly uneven ; towards the north-west it swells into high, broken, hilly lands ; but there are no mountains, and this hilly country is extremely romantic and pleasant. The state is remark ably well watered, abounding in small streams ; and every county is chequered with innumerable highways, crossing each other in all directions. As the people of Connecticut first set the example of making turnpike roads in New England, these and other good roads are so abundant, that travelling is greatly facilitated ; which is rendered still more agreeable by a number of fine bridges, some of them constructed at a vast expence, which are of great utility. A traveller in any of these roads, will seldom pass more than half a mile or a mile without finding a house, and a farm under such improvements as to afford every thing needful for the support of a family. The whole state resembles a well-cultivated garden, which, with that degree of industry essential to happiness, produces the necessaries and conveniences of life in great abundance. The land is laid out in small farms, from fifty to 300 acres each, which are held by the farmers in perpetuity, and are generally cultivated as well as the nature of the soil will admit. The climate is subject to many and sudden changes, passing to the extremes of heat and cold ; but it is never theless very healthy. Some years since, not less than one in forty-six of all the inhabitants then living, were upwards of seventy years of age ; and it has been fully ascertained, that about one in eight attain the age of seventy years and upwards ; one in thirteen to the age of eighty years ; and"], [368, "350 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA one in about thirty to the age of ninety. The shortest day is eight hours and fifty-eight minutes, and the longest fifteen hours. The soil is various ; some parts being poor and sandy, and others very fertile; generally speaking, there is a large proportion osgood land, and the state is remarkably well calculated for pasture and mowing, which enables the farmers to feed large numbers of neat cattle and horses. It has been proved by actual calculation, that any given quan tity of the best mowing land in this state produces about twice as much clear profit, as the same quantity of the best wheat land in the state of New York. The agricul ture of this state is in a condition which speaks volumes in praise of equal laws. There is no feudal system, no law of primogeniture ; hence there are no overgrown estates on the one hand, and very few of those employed in husbandry are oppressed by indigence on the other ; the circumstances of the people in Connecticut is an absence of the extreme either of wealth or poverty. The ground is cultivated by a hardy , industrious race, whose labours are rewarded by the blessings of Heaven in \" peace, health, and sweet content.\" The produce of the state is wheat, rye, Indian corn, oats, barley, buck wheat, flax in large quantity, potatoes of several kinds, some hemp, with a great variety of vege tables, and fruits of all kinds which are common to the climate. The beef, pork, butter, and cheese of Con necticut are equal to auy in the world. Of the mineral productions, iron is found in the greatest abundance ; lead, copper, and zinc have also been discovered ; but not in sufficient quantity to induce the inhabitants to dig for it. The marble raised in Hhis state is of a species so exquisitely beautiful, as to have become an article of ex portation to France and other countries. There are a number of mineral springs ; the most important is in Litchfield county, which is very useful in curing various diseases, particularly rheumatism, and those of the cuta neous kind. Civil divisions, towns, population, religion, character, &c. \u2014 Connecticut is divided into eight counties, and these are subdivided into 119 townships, containing 261,942 inhabitants, being about sixty-five to the square mile ; a denser population than is to be found in any of the other United States."], [369, "351 STATE OF CONNECTICUT.

From 1774 to 1782, the increase was no more than 11,294 persons ; but this comparatively small advance iu population may be easily accounted for from the destruction of the war, and the numerous emigra . tions to Vermont, New Hampshire, and the other states. The people are almost entirely of English descent ; there being no Dutch, French, or Germans, and very few Scotch or Irish in any part of the state. Hartford, the capital of Connecticut, is a very hand- some city, and is, alternately with Newhaven, the seat of legislation sor the state. It is situated on Connecticut river, at the head of sloop navigation, fifty miles above Long Island sound, 341 from Washington city, 202 from Philadelphia, and 111 from New York ; and is regularly laid out, the streets crossing each other at right angles. Its buildings are the state-house, an elegant edifice, two congregational churches, one for episcopalians, and about 500 dwelling-houses ; a great number of which are very handsomely' built. The citizens carry on an active com- merce to the southern states and to the West Indies ; and they have a large share of domestic trade, having a very fine and extensive back country. Considerable manufac- tures are established in this city, and are rapidly increas- ing, being encouraged by the government ; those of woollen in particular are in a flourishing state. The markets are well supplied with provisions, which are sold at a very reasonable rate ; the prices in the Boston market, given in page 308, are higher than the same articles were at Hartford, in February, 1819. Newhaven, the semi-metropolis of this state, is a very pleasing city ; the surrounding scenery is extremely fine, and the situation highly agreeable and favourable for commerce. It is built at the head of a bay, about sous"], [370, "352 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. miles from Long Island sound, and thirty-four from Hart ford, on the road leading to New York : it covers part of a large plain, circumscribed on three sides by high hitls, and is agreeably laid out, with regular streets, and a fine square in the middle, round which are the public build ings ; the whole making a very handsome appearance. Its buildings are Yale college, founded in 1700, consisting of three college edifices, a chapel, and library ; three congregational churches, and one for episcopalians, a state-house, and about 600 dwelling-houses, mostly of wood ; but being all neatly painted, they have a very clean, and pretty appearance. The inhabitants are en gaged in a considerable trade with New York and the West Indies ; and manufacture card-teeth, linen, buttons, cotton goods, and paper, to a large amount. In this city about one in seventy die annually, which proves the healthfulness of its climate ; indeed, as to pleasantness of situation and purity of air, Newhaven is not exceeded by any town in the United States. New London is finely situated on the river Thames, about three miles from its entrance into the Sound, and is the most commercial town in Connecticut. It has three places of public worship, and about 400 dwelling-houses ; and is defended by two forts, one on each side of the river. It is fifty-four miles from Newhaven, forty-three from Hartford, and 130 from New York. A great part of this town was burnt by general Arnold in 1781 ; but has been since rebuilt. Norwich stands on the same river, fourteen miles north of New London, and forty south-east of Hartford ; and is a flourishing commercial place, with a rich and widely extended back country. It avails itself of its eligible situation on a navigable river, which affords a great num ber of convenient seats for mills, and for water machinery of every description : accordingly, the inhabitants manu facture paper of various sorts, stockings, clocks aud watches, chaises, buttons, stone and earthenware, oil, Chocolate, wire, bells, anchors, and all kinds of forge work. The cify contains about 600 dwelling-houses, a court house, two churches for eongregationalits, one for episco palian*, and above 3,000 inhabitants. Here is an academy, and a school supported by the donation of a deceased benefactor: the courts of law are held alternately at Nor wich and New London. Litchfield, Danbury, Windham, Tolland, Fairfield, Windsor, Farmington, Milford, Stratford, Guildford, and Wethei .field, are all considerable and thriviug towns ;"], [371, "353 STATE OF CONNECTICUT. the last is the oldest town in the state, and is remarkable for the culture of fine onions. Here a company of young women have cultivated that root with so much success, as to build a church with the profits. The other towns are numerous, the whole country being studded with them ; containing from 500 to 1,500 or 2,000 inhabitants. The houses are generally built of wood, on a handsome plan, and are painted white, often with green window shutters ; which give these dwellings an air of great clean liness and neatness. In religion, the form of church government is generally congregational, or presbyterian ; but every other form may be freely exercised. Episcopalians and baptists are likewise numerous; the latter sect, during the revolution ary war, were warm and active friends to their country, and have ever since manifested a continuance of their patriotic sentiments. In this truly republican state, all men are upon a footing of equality with respect to religion ; and disqualifications for offices on account of religious opinions are entirely unknown. Every sect whose princi ples do not militate against the peace of society, enjoy here the full liberty of conscience ; and a spirit of libera lity and benevolence is every where prevalent. The clergy are a respectable body of learned and serious men, enjoying a happy and useful share of influence among their people, especially since the revival of religion through a great part of the state ; and it is in part to their exertions that any evident reformation has taken plaoe in the manners of the inhabitants. The general character of the people of Connecticut differs but little from that of the citizens in the other eastern states already described ; only the former are too much distinguished by a desire for having all their dis putes, even of the most trifling nature, settled according to law. This litigious spirit affords employment and support to a numerous brood of lawyers ; who thrive and fatten by the captious disposition and folly of their coun trymen. The great bulk ofthe inhabitants are industrious, sagacious husbandmen ; and their farms furnish them with all the necessaries, most of the conveniences, and but few of the luxuries of life : hence they are generally tempe rate, and, if they choose, ean subsist with as much inde pendence as is consistent with human happiness. They are well informed with respect to rights, and judicious in the means they take to secure them ; political peace and unanimity are the consequences. Living under a free government they have not to fear the frowns of a digni-"], [372, "354 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. fied tyrant; and there are no overgrown estates, wish proud and ambitious landlords, to have an undue and pernicious influence in the election of civil officers. No person qualified by law is, or can be, prohibited from voting for whom he pleases ; and it is the mau who has the most merit, not he who has the most money, that is generally chosen into public office. That base business of electioneering, which is at once the disgrace and the curse of some other countries, and of none more than of Great Britain, and which is directly calculated to intro- duce the basest and most unprincipled men into office, is very little known in the free state of Connecticut. Pro- perty is here divided, as it every where ought to be ; and it will remain so while estates continue to descend as they do at present. A thirst for learning prevails among all ranks of people in this state ; and more of the young men of Connecticut, in proportion to their numbers, receive a public education, than in any other state ofthe Union. Besides the college art Newhaven, academies have been established at Green- field, Canterbury, Norwich, Plaiufield, Windham, and Pomfret ; and the law directs that a grammar school shall be kept in every county-town throughout the state. But the great and lasting advantage on this branch, arises from the establishment of schools in every township, being an arrangement similar to the parish schools of Scotland, and which produce similar effects \u2014 a general diffusion of knowledge, steady habits, and sobriety of manners. Connecticut has ever made rapid advances in popula tion ; and though there have been more emigrations from this than from any of the other states, it is yet full of inhabitants. During the unnatural contest between Great Britain and her American colonies, by which the latter established their independence, the citizens of this state were highly distinguished, both in the field and in the cabinet, in bringing about the revolution. Her soldiers were applauded by general Washington for their courage and good conduct ; and during the Jate ill-advised and unfortunate war, such of them as were engaged in it, were no less conspicuous for bravery and fidelity. The militia are a body of fine troops, fully armed and equipped for service, and by the return to the war-office for the year 1818, amounted to 20,573 men. Trade, manufactures, &c. \u2014 This state has still a con siderable coasting and foreign trade ; though not so much as formerly. So far back as the year 1774, the value of"], [373, "355 STATE OF CONNECTICUT. the whole exported produce and commodities was estima ted at \u00a3200,000 sterling. In the year 1791, the amount of foreign exports was 710,340 dollars; besides coasting trade to a great amount, ln the following year, 749,925 dollars; in the year 1793, 770,239 dollars; in 1794, 806,746 dollars ; and in the year 1801, 1,606,800 dollars. At the latter period, the state owned and employed 32,867 tons of shipping; in 1810, the tonnage amounted to 45,108 tons; and in 1817, the total exports, foreign and domestic, was only 604,139 dollars. From this it appears, that although the tonnage had increased for the nine years preceding 1810; yet the exportation had de creased in a much greater proportion between 1801 and 1817. The principal trade of this state is with the West Indies, to which it exports live stock, timber, grain, fruit, fish, provisions, &c. A large number of coasting Vessels are employed in carrying the produce of the state to the other sections of the Union. To Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire, they earry pork, wheat, Indian corn, and rye. To North and South Carolina, and Georgia, butter, cheese, salted beef, Cider, apples, potatoes, hay, &c. and receive in return rice, indigo, and money. But as New Fork is nearer, and the state of the markets always well known, much of the produce of Connecticut, especially of the western parts, is carried there ; particularly pot and pearl ashes, flax seed, beef, pork, cheese, and batter, in large quantities. A considerable portion ofthe produce ofthe eastern parts of the state is marketed at Boston, Providence, and Nor wich. The imports are, manufactured piece goods ofthe finer kinds, wines, and groceries. There are considerable and important manufactures, ou a large scale, throughout the state ; viz. woollens, linens, cottons, leather of every description, hats, stockings, paper, wire, bells, chaises, harness, &c. &c. There is likewise mucb domestic manufacture ; the farmers and their families being all dressed in cloth of their own making, which is good and substantial. Their linens and woollens are made in the family way, and though they are generally of a coarser kind, they are of a stronger texture, and much more durable than those imported from Great Britain and France : many of their cloths are fine and handsome. Here are large orchards of mulberry trees ; and silk worms have been reared so successfully, as to promise not only a supply of silk for the inhabitants, but a surplus for exportation. The principal seats of the different manu- 2z"], [374, "356 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. factures are as follow : In Newhaven, are linen and but ton manufactories ; in Hartford, extensive woollen estab lishments, glass works, snuff and powder mills, iron works, slitting mills, &c. Iron works are also established at Salisbury, Norwich, and other parts of the state. At Stratford are made large quantities of hollow ware, and other ironmongery, sufficient to supply the whole state. At Stratford a duck manufactory has been long established, and is iu a flourishing state ; aud paper is made in great variety at Norwich, Hartford, Newhaven, and in the county of Litchfield. Constitution.\u2014 Connecticut sends two senators and seven representatives to congress. The state government is derived from the ancient charter granted by Charles II. in 1662 ; by which the legislative authority is vested in a governor, deputy-governor, twelve counsellors, and the representatives of the people, styled the general assembly. They are divided into two branches, of which the gover nor, deputy-governor, and counsellors, form one ; and the representatives the other ; and no law can pass with out the concurrence of both. The governors and coun sellors are chosen annually, and the representatives, who must not exceed two for each town, are chosen twice every year. The suffrage is universal, every freeman who is osage having a vote, without regard to property.* History. \u2014 The present state of Connecticut, at the time of the first, arrival of the English, was possessed by the Pequot, the Mohegan, Podunk, and many other smaller tribes of Indians. In 1774, there were of the descend _ints ofthe ancient natives, only 1363 persons ; the greater .part of whom lived at Mohegan, between New London and Norwich ; and from the natural decrease of the Indians, it is imagined that their number in this state does not now amount to 400. The first grant of Connecticut was made by the Ply mouth council to the earl of Warwick, in 1630 ; and in the year following, the earl assigned this grant to lord Say and Sele, lord Brook, and nine others. In 1633, some Indian traders settled at Windsor, and the same year, a little before the arrival of the English, a few Dutch traders \u2022 A new constitution is about tote established in Connecticut; for which pur pose numerous town and district meetings were held in 1818. The people seem to be unanimous in condemning the charter, which they have so long suffered to be in force, as materially imperfect and defective ; and altogether unfit for a repub lican forai of government."], [375, "357 STATE OF CONNECTICUT. fixed themselves at Hartford, where the remains of the settlement are still visible, on the bank of Connecticut river. In 1634, lord Say and Sele, &c sent over a small number of men, who built a fort at Saybrook, and made a treaty with the Pequot Indians for the lands on Con- necticut river. Mr. Haynes and Mr. Hooker left Massa- chusetts in 1634, and settled at Hartford ; and the follow- ing year Mr. Eaton and Mr. Davenport seated themselves at Newhaven. In 1644, the Connecticut adventurers purchased of Mr. Fenwick, agent to the proprietors, their right to the colony for \u00a31,600. For many years after this period, Newhaven and Con- necticut continued two distinct governments ; and from their first settlement, increased rapidly. Large tracts of land were purchased ofthe Indians, and new towns settled from Stamford to Stonington, and far back into the coun- try ; when, in 1661, major John Mason, as agent for the colonists, bought of the natives all lands which had not before been purchased by particular towns, and made a public surrender of them to the colony, in the presence ofthe general assembly. A petition was then presented to king: Charles II., praying him to grant a charter ; and in 1662 their request was complied with, and a charter granted, constituting the two colonies for ever one body corporate and politic, by the name of \" The governor and company of Connecticut.\" Newhaven took this affair very ill ; but in 1665 all difficulties were amicably adjusted ; and, as has been already observed, this charter has con- tinued to be the basis of their government ever since. In 1672, the laws of the colony were revised, and order- ed to be printed ; and also that every family should buy one of the law books. Perhaps it is owing to this early and universal spread of \" law books\" that the people of Connecticut are, to fhis day, so preposterously fond of law. The years 1675 and 1676 were distinguished by the wars with king Philip and his Indians, by which the colony was thrown info great distress and confosion. The inroads of the enraged savages were marked with cruel murders, and with fire and devastation. In 1684, the charter of Massachusetts and Plymouth were taken away, and the charter of Connecticut would have shared the same fate, had it not been for the vigilance of a Mr. Wandsworth, who, having very artfully procured it when it was on the point of being delivered up, buried it under an oak tree in Hartford, where it remained till all danger was over, and then was dug up and reassumed. In 1750, the laws of Connecticut were again revised and"], [376, "358 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. published ; and Dr. Douglass observes, tbat they were \" the most natural, equitable, plain, and concise code of laws, for plantations, hitherto extant.\" There has been a revision of them since the peace of 1783, in which they were greatly, and very judiciously simplified. STATE OF NEW YORK. Situation, Boundaries, and Extent. This interesting state is situated between 40\u00b0 33' and 45\u00b0 N. lat. and 3\u00b0 43' E. and 2\u00b0 43' W. long. It is bounded on the north by lake Ontario, which separates it from Upper Canada ; south, by Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and the Atlantic ocean ; east, by Vermont, Massachusetts, and Connecticut ; and west, by Upper Canada, lake Erie, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey. Its length from east to west is 25.6, and its breadth from north to south 198 miles ; but it is very irregular. The square contents amount to 46,000 square miles, or 28,440,000 acres ; being 19,000 square miles larger than Scotland. Bays, lakes, and river.?. \u2014 York bay spreads to the souths ward before tbe city of New York, and is nine miles long and four broad. It is formed by the confluence of East and Hudson's rivers, and embosoms several small islands, of which Governor's island is the principal. It commu nicates with the ocean through the Narrows, between Staten and Long islands, which are scarcely two miles apart; the passage up to New York is safe, and not above twenty miles in length. South-bay is an arm of lake Champlain, (described in page 29) which from the south end of the lake extends itself in a south-westerly direc tion. At the strait where it unites with Champlain, it receives Wood creek from the south. The lakes in this state are very numerous ; there being no less than fifteen, from ten to forty miles in length, and many smaller ones, exhibiting as great an extent, variety, and beauty, of inland water scenery as all the other states together. Lake George lies to the southward of lake Champlain, and its waters are about 100 feet higher. The portage between the two lakes is a mile and a half ; bu^"], [377, "359 STATE OF NEW YORK. with a small expense might be reduced to sixty yards, and with one or two locks it might be made navigable through. It is a most clear, beautiful collection of water, thirty-six miles long, and from one to seven wide ; it embosoms be tween 2 and 300 islands, which are in general little more than barron rocks, covered with heath, and a few trees and shrubs, with abundance of rattle-snakes. This fine lake _s skirted by prodigious mountains, and is celebrated for the quantity and variety of its fish. The famous fort of Ticonderoga, which stood at the north side of the outlet of the lake, is now in ruins. The other principal lakes are Oneida, Onondago, Skaneateless, Owasca, Cayuga, Seneca, Canandagua, and Chataughque. Oneida lake, in Onondago county, is between twenty and thirty miles long and about five wide ; it is connected with lake Ontario on the west by Oswego river, and with fort Stanwix, on Mohawk river, by Wood creek. Onondago lake, in the county of the same name, is about six miles long and a mile broad, aud sends its waters to Seneca river. It is strongly impregnated with saline particles, occasioned by salt springs a few yards from its banks. These springs are capable of producing immense quantities of salt, and are a great benefit to the country. Skaneateless lake, in the same county, is fourteen mites long and one broad ; it waters the military townships of Marcellus and Sempronins, and sends its waters northerly into Seneca river. Owasco lake, partly in the townships of Aurelius and Scipio, in Onondago county, is about eleven miles long and one broad, and communicates with Seneca river on the north by a stream wbich runs through the town of Brutus. Cayuga is a beautiful lake in Cayuga county, from thirty five to forty miles long, and from two to three miles wide; abounding with salmon, bass, cat-fish, eels, &c. During the spring of 1818 not less than 8,000 tons of gypsum, or plaster of Paris, were brought from the eastern side of this lake to the village of Ithaca, in Seneca county, and thence carried in waggons to Oswego, on Susquehanna river, a distance of twenty-nine miles; in this convey, ance more than 300 teams were at one time employed. From Oswego it was conveyed in arks and on rafts down the river, and sold to the farmers of Pennsylvania. At Ithaca she gypsum is worth four dollars a ton, at Oswego ten dollars, and in the Pennsylvania market eighteen dollars. A small quantity of it having been conveyed to the head of the Allegany, and down that river 260 miles to Pittsburgh, was there sold at fifty dollars a ton."], [378, "360 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. Seneca lake, in Ontario county,, is a handsome piece of water nearly forty miles long and about two wide. At the north-west corner of the lake stands the town of Geneva, and on the east side, between it and Cayuga, are the towns of Romulus, Ovid, Hector, and Ulysses, in Onondago county. A quarry of very elegant marble, beautifully variegated, of an excellent quality, and proof against fire, has lately been discovered on the banks of this lake. Its outlet is Scayace river, which also receives the waters of Cayuga lake, eighteen miles below Geneva. Canandaigua lake aud creek are also in Ontario county ; the lake is about twenty miles long and three broad, and sends its waters in a north-east direction thirty-five miles, to Seneca river. Chautaughquelake, in Genessee county, is twenty-two miles long and from two to six wide, at the head of which stands the pleasant village of Fredonia, possessing a good boat and raft navigation to. Pittsburgh and New Orleans ; the portage from Fredonia to lake Erie is only nine miles over a good road. SLx or eight miles east of Chautaughque lake are the three Casdaga lakes, from one to five miles in circumference, and dis- charging their waters into the east branch of the river Connewango. There are many fine rivers in this state ; the princi- pal of which are the Hudson, or North river, the Mohawk, the Oneida, and the Genessee ; together with above twenty others navigable by boats and rafts. The Hudson passes its whole course in the state of New York, and is one of the largest and finest rivers in the United States. It rises in a mountainous country between lakes Ontario and Champlain, and from thence to its entrance into York bay is about 250 miles in length ; the tide flows a few miles above Albany, which is 170 miles from New York. The river is navigable for sea vessels to Albany, and to Troy, five miles distant ; but smaller vessels may proceed a considerable way furtber. The bed of this river, which is deep and smooth to an amazing distance, through a hilly, rocky country, and even through ridges of some of the highest mountains in the United States, must un doubtedly have been produced by some mighty convulsion in uature ; its passage through the highlands, which is about seventeen miles, affords a wild romantic scene. The two celebrated canals wbich are to connect the Hudson with lakes Erie and Champlain are carrying on with great activity, and, in all probability, will be com pleted within the time appointed. The first of these, or Grand Western Canal, commenced in July, 1816; many"], [379, "361 STATE OF NEW YORK. portions of which have been contracted for, and in Octo ber, 1818, were in a considerable state of forwardness. Upon an allotment, which extends from Utica to within seven miles of Seneca river, a distance of eighty-five miles, above 2,000 meu have been constantly employe\" t ; and the work has been prosecuted with such spirited exertion, that in December, 1818, the excavation was completed, and much done towards the construction of the necessary embankments, culverts, locks, &c. This stupendous under taking, compared with which the largest canal in Europe would appear a mere Lilliputian performance, is 353f miles in length, from Albany to Buffalo, on lake Erie ; the water of which is fifty-six feet higher than tide water at the city of Albany, and 145 feet higher than the sum mit level at Rome, ill miles from Albany, on the route of the canal. The number of locks will be seventy-seven, the aggregate rise aud fall in the whole distance 66 li feet, and the total expense, according to the report of the com missioners, 4,881,738 dollars, or \u00a31,098,391 sterling.* The Northern Canal, which is to unite the Hudson with lake Champlain and the river St. Lawrence, commences at Fort Edward, in Washington county, forty-nine miles north of Albany, and terminates at Whitehall, in the same county, a distance of twenty-two miles. The water iu this canal is not to be less than thirty feet wide at the surface, twenty feet at the bottom, and three feet deep. Nine locks will be required, each of which must be seventy five feet long, and ten feet wide in the clear ; the estimated expense amounts to 871,000 dollars, or \u00a3195,975 sterling. In January, 1819, the digging and excavating of the canal, in its whole extent, had been completed, and a great part of the materials for constructing the locks collected and prepared ; so that there is little doubt that a water com munication between lake Champlain and New York will be opened before the close of another season. The Mohawk river rises near Oneida lake, and running a south-east course about 130 miles, falls into the Hudson eight miles above Albany. The navigation of this river is obstructed by the Cohoes falls, about two miles above its entrance into the Hudson ; but goods are carried by land between Albany and Skenectady, fifteen miles; and, except a portage of about a mile, sixty miles further up, the river is passable for boats from Skenectady to its source, where it communicates by another canal with Wood creek, and from thence to lake Ontario. Oneida * Upon the map of the United States, prefixed to this volume, the range of the canal is marked, with the intermediate distances."], [380, "362 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. river rises near Rome, by a stream called Wood creek, which, after a western course of ten or twelve miles, joius Fish creek ; the united stream then dilates into Oneida Jake, from the western extremity of which the river again issues, and runs about forty miles to lake Ontario. It is navigable by boats fo the falls, which occasion a portage of twenty yards only, from whence it is again navigable to the lake, and thence, through Wood creek, almost to fort Stanwix; whence there is a portage of a mile to Mohawk river. Oneida river is of great importance, as it forms part of the chain of communication between the tludSon and the lakes; and, through the medium of the Seneca river, \\. hich falls into the Oneida a little above the falls, it may , in process of time, form an important route between lake Ontario and the smaller lakes in the interior ofthe country. Genessee river rises in Pennsylvania, and running a northerly course of about 100 miles through the Genessee country, falls into lake Ontaria eighty miles to the eastward of Niagara falls. Fifty miles from its source there are fal.s of forty feet, and five miles from ils mouth, of seventy-five feet, and a little higher up of ninety six feet ; these falls furnish capital mill-seats, of which the inhabitants have availed themselves. This river waters a fine tract of country, remarkable for its natural advan tages, its fertile soil, and mild climate. The head waters of the Delaware, Susquehannah, and Allegany rivers are in the southern parts of the state. Climate, face of the country, soil, and produce.\u2014 The climate of this state is very various. In that part which lies to the southward of the highlands, about fifty miles above New York, it is remarkably changeable ; experi encing all the extremities of heat and cold, and sometimes a change of thirty degrees in the course of twenty-four hours. Among the mountains, and along lake Champlain, towards Canada, the winters are long and severe, and she summers are often sultry and hot. In the western district, the climate is more temperate, and the winters are subject to a good deal of rain ; but the whole country is healthy, the neighbourhood of ponds and undrained marshes excepted. The winter commences about Christ mas and ends in February ; but March and April are frequently cold months. There is a great variety in the aspect of the country ; particularly to the east of the Allegany mountains, where the land is broken into hills, with many rich intervening"], [381, "363 STATE OF NEW YORK. valleys. These mountains and others intersect the state in ridges, in a. north-east and south-west direction from the northern extremity of the state to Utica westward. From thence to its western boundary, nearly 300 miles, there is an elegant country, rich and well watered, and for the most part a dead level ; having spurs of the Alle gany mountains on the one side, and on the other the lakes Ontario and Erie, two of the finest sheets Of water in the world : all the numerous creeks which flow into the latter have many falls, which afford a great number of excellent mill-seats; The soil in such an extent of country must be various. The southern and eastern parts are dry and gravelly, in termixed with loam, and is not very rich ;.,the mountainous districts are pretty well adapted for grazing, and there are many rich valleys on the rivers. The whole ofthe north ern and western parts are rich and fertile, except a small portion bordering on the state of Pennsylvania, which, however, is interspersed with good land. The hills are generally clothed thick with timber, and towards the west, a fine rich soil is covered, in its natural state, with maple, beech, birch, cherry, black walnut, locust, hickory, and some mulberry-trees. Of the commodities produced by culture, wheat is the principal, which in grain and in flour is exported in prodigious quantities ; the other agri^ cultural products are Indian corn, barley, oats, rye, peas, beans, hemp, flaX, &c. The best lands in this state are those upon the Mohawk river, north of it, and west ofthe Alleganies ; all of which are rapidly settling. The counties of Genessee, Allegany, Niagara, Cattaraugus, and Chaufaughque, except the east ern parts of the two first, constitute wbat is called the \" Holland Purchase,\" which contains about 4,000,000 of acres. This extensive and fertile tract is bounded by a transit line running north from the Pennsylvania state line to lake Ontario', being 97 miles in length ; north, by lake Ontario ; west, by the river Niagara and lake Erie ; and south, by Pennsylvania. The southern parts of this pur chase are watered by the Allegany an'd ConnewaDgO rivers, and eight tributary creeks ; the Genessee river and Allen's Creek flow info lajce Ontario ; four considerable creeks empty into the river Niagara ; and seven into lake Erie ; all these rivers and creeks have their ctfuYse-through this fine country. In 1797, the above lands were purchased from the Seneca Indians and the state of Massachusetts for about three-pence an acre ; and in 1799 they were surveyed and laid out into townships of six miles square. NO. XVI. 3 A"], [382, "364 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. The sale of lots commenced the same year, at from 5s. l\\d. to Us. 3d. an acre ; at present, the price of wild lands is from four to twelve dollars, and of improved lands from twelve to twenty dollars, and upwards. The soil for the most part is a deep grey loam ; the timber, beech, sugar maple, bass wood, elm, white ash, and black cherry ; with about 500,000 acres of the finest white pine timber in America. The flats bordering upon the Genessee river are amongst the richest lands that are to be met with in the United States, to the east of the Ohio. On the first settlement of this country, the soil was too strong to bear wheat ; but at pre sent it produces abundance of that essential grain. Indeed, the ground is so extremely rich and fertile, that it does not appear to be the least exhausted by the successive crops of Indian corn and hemp wbich are raised upon it year after year. The high lands in the neighbourhood of the Genessee are stony, and not remarkable for fertility; but the valleys are uncommonly fruitful, and abound with fine timber. The summers in this part ofthe country are by no means so hot as towards the Atlantic, and the win ters are moderate ; the snow seldom lying longer than six weeks. In the western counties of the state of New York provi sions are very reasonable, while labour of every descrip tion is well paid for. ln that part of the country just described, (which may be taken as a standard for the whole,) tbe rates of the markets are as follow : flour 2 1 dol lars per cwt. ; beef, mutton, pork, and veal, from three to five cents, and poultry six cents per lb. ; board two dol lars a week ; and house rent for mechanics, in villages, about fifty dollars per annum. Blacksmiths, masons, car penters, and cabinet makers are in request, and meet with encouragement; the three former are paid a dollar and a half per day, the latter work by the piece ; when smiths are employed in that manner, the charge is twenty-five cents per lb. ; labourers receive one dollar a day. All the western parts of this state are settled and settling principally by people from Connecticut, Massachusetts, and the other New England states ; few emigrants from Europe have as yet fixed their residence in this fruitful country. Most of the districts adjoining the Atlantic, including Long and Staten islands, the former of which comprises King's, Queen's, and Suffolk counties ; and the latter constituting the county of Richmond, have been long, and, in mauy places, thickly settled. Long Island is situated at tlie southern extremity of the state, of which"], [383, "365 STATE OF NEW YORK. it is a very interesting portion. Its length is about 140 miles, and its medium breadth from ten to fourteen miles; extending from Hudson's river, opposite to Staten Island, almost to the western boundaries of the eoast of Rhode Island. The soil here is very well calculated for raising grain, hay, and fruit ; and on the sea coast are extensive tracts of salt meadow, which are, however, well adapted to the culture of grain, particularly Indian corn. In Queen's county is Hampstead plain, sixteen miles long and about eight broad ; it produces some rye, and large herds of cattle are fed upon it, as well as upon the salt marshes. On the south side of the island vast quantities of oysters are taken ; forty or fifty vessels are often here at a time loading with them. The produce of the middle and west- ern parts of this island is carried to New York, where a ready market is always to be sound. The population of Long Island, by the last census, amounted to 48,752. Staten Island lies nine miles south-west of the city of New York, and is about eighteen miles in length, and at a medium six or seven in breadth ; containing 5,347 inha- bitants. On the south side is a considerable tract of level, good land ; but the island in general is rough and the hills high. The inhabitants are chiefly descendants ofthe Dutch and French ; and are noted for their hospitality to strangers. The principal mineral productions of this state are iron. and lead ore; copper and zinc have also been fonnd in various places ; and silver has likewise been discovered, but in no great quantity. Marble abounds, and is of an excellent quality ; and freestone and slate are in great plenty. Plaster of Paris is raised in several parts of the state, and much used as a manure ; sulphur is common in many places, and coal has been found, but in no great quautity. The salt springs at Onondago have been already noticed, and there are numerous air springs ; which last are probably the gas arising from beds of pit coal on fire in the bowels of the earth. There is a medicinal spring at New Lebanon, twenty-nine miles from Albany, which affords a pleasant bath, at the temperature of 72\u00b0, and is much fre- quented ; but the most remarkable springs in this state, or indeed in the United States, are those of Ballstown and Saratoga, the former thirty-two, and the latter thirty-six miles from Albany. The waters are highly medicinal, and are greatly resorted to in the summer season. Civil divisions, towns, population, religion, character, &c, \u2014 In the year 1731, the state of New York, then a"], [384, "366 UNITED STATES OF A.MERICA. British provipce, contained ten counties and only 50,291 inhabitants; in 1771, same counties and 163,338 inhabit- ants, in 1786, (thirty-three years since,) twelve counties and 238,896 inhabitants; in 1791, sixteen counties and a population of 340,120 souls; in 1800, there were thirty counties, 305 towns (including three cities) and 586,000 inhabitants; at the last general census, in 1810, the num- ber of counties was forty-five ; of towns (including four cities) 452; of villages, containing from thirty or forty to 600 houses, 300 ; with a population of 959,049 souls ; giving an increase of fifteen counties, 147 towns, and 373,049 people in ten years ! But at the commencement of 1818, the populatiqn amounted, by a state census, to no less than 1,486,739 persons; being about nineteen to the square mile, and an increase, in seven years, of 526,739. inhabitants; of whom 112,586 are regularly enrolled in the militia.

The island is fourteen mites long, and, on an average, about one in breadth. The city stands on the south end, closely built from shore to shore, and is in length about two miles and a quarter, in breadth nearly one mite, and in circumference six; the present population (1819) is said to be 120,000. The East river separates it from Long Island, and the Hudson, or North river, from the state of New Jersey ; the latter river is nearly two miles wide, the former is not quite so broad. Ships of any burden can come up to the quays, and lie there with perfect safety, in a natural har bour, formed by the above-named fine rivers, and a noble bay, completely protected by the surrounding lands. The city consists of about 17,000 houses, including public edifices and warehouses ; and the number is rapidly in- * Laid out since tt)e f _ psuj was takon."], [388, "368 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. creasing. In the summer of 1818 it was computed that 2,000 new buildings were erecting, and most of them large and elegant; the houses are generally built of brick, with slated or shingled roofs, Within the city wooden houses are not allowed ; but in the environs they are general ; and being commonly two stories high, painted white, with green shutters, many of them are very handsome. The plan of New York is not regular, several of the streets in the old part of the town being too narrow, aud some of them crooked ; but all the modern part is built with much better taste, and most of the new streets are uncommonly elegant. Broadway is the finest street in tho city, and from its great beauty and importance, merits a particular description. It commences at the Battery, on the.south-east point of the city, and runs in a north-east direction about two miles and two furlongs, where it forms a junction with the Bowery road, wbich is 100 feet wide, and is connected with the road leading to Boston. The breadth of Broadway, including the side-pavements, is about eighty feet, and it is regular throughout ils whole length. It ie ornamented with rows of poplar trees on each side, and a number of public buildings are situated on it; particularly the custom-house, Trinity church, St. Paul's church, the mechanics' hall, the hospital, and the edifices for the city, business. The street rises by a gradual ascent about haif a mite, and is at its greatest elevation opposite to the city buildings. Greenwich-street is next in importance; it commences also at the Battery, and running due north about two miles, connects the city with the village of Greenwich. Pearl-street is one of the most important in the city, in point of trade ; it rises like- wise near the Battery, and runs parallel with East river to Cherry-street; from thence it runs. to the northward, and joins Chatham-street, from which it has been extended to Broadway. Cherry-street is a continuation of Pearl-street, aud runs along the East river, till it is terminated by a bend in that river. The other principal streets are Wall- street, where most of the banks and public offices are situated ; Chatham-street, on which the theatre stands ; Front-street, Water-street, and Broad-street. lhat part of the city which has been recently laid out upon East river, is constructed on a very handsome plan ; the streets crossing each other at right angles, and there are several public squares : but of these there are by far too few in the city, and they are hardly worthy of notice. The Battery, already mentioned, is a fine piece of ground, commanding an- elegant view of the bay, islands, an<fc"], [389, "369 STATE OF NEW YORK. shipping, and affords a most charming walk. On a sum* mer's evening it is crowded with people, as it is open to the breezes from the sea, which render it particularly agreeable at that season. There is a triangular piece of ground, called the Park, in frout of the public buildings, which is very ornamental ; aud these are all tbe public walks to be found iu New York. The public buildings are numerous and handsome. The first in importance is the city hall, fronting the Park ; it is built of white marble, and is said to be the most elegant building in America : indeed it is surpassed by very few in Europe. The others are, federal hall, custom-house, col lege, coffee-house, mechanics' hall, theatre, hospital, state prison, and bridewell. There are forty-six places of pub lic worship, viz. five Dutch reformed churches, six presby terian, three associated reformed ditto, one associated presbyterian, one reformed ditto, five methodist, two for black people, one German reformed, one evangelical Lutheran, one Moravian, four trinitarian baptist, one universalist, two catholic, three quaker, eight episcopalian, one Jews synagogue, and a small congregation who dis pense with a priest entirely ; every member following what they call the apostolic plan of instructing each other, and \" building one another up in their most holy faith.\" The city is accommodated with five public markets, of which the Fly-market is the principal ; and these are well supplied with wholesome provisions, in neat and excellent order ; which are generally sold at reasonable rates. The following is a list of the prices, in English money, at the beginning of the year 1819: beef, mutton, and veal from Ad. fo 6d. per lb. ; ham and bacon 8d. to lOd. ; dried beef, 9d. ; fowls,* 1*.

House rent is extravagantly hig-b, in respectable streets lhat are eligible for business. In the skirts of the town, a small house, one story high, the front rooms of a moderate size, the back rooms less, but suited sor beds, is from \u00a312 to \u00a314 per annum. A mechanic who has a family ean have two small rooms for \u00a318 a year. About balsa mile out of the city, a small two story house, with two rooms on the first floor, and two closet bed-rooms on the same, one room in she garret, and she use of the kitchen, has been let for \u00a324 10s. the landlord paying the taxes. A very small house, in a situation inconvenient for business, con- taining six rooms, is worth from \u00a375 to \u00a380 a year ; a simi- lar house in a-better situation, \u00a395 to \u00a3105 ; a ditto in ac good street for business, \u00a3130 to \u00a3140 ; a ditto in a first rate retail situation, \u00a3160 to \u00a3200 per annum : rt is to be\" observed that this is the smallest class of houses. A house containing a kitchen and servant's bed-room under ground, a dining-room, small parlour, and closet on the ground floor, a drawing-room and large bed-room on the first floor, three bed-rooms on the Second, three in the attic, and a small back yard, the rent is \u00a3202 10s. and the taxes \u00a311 5s. A similar house to this, in a first rate private house situation, would be \u00a3300 to \u00a3350 per annum ; were it appropriated to business, the rent would be higher. In Broadway, the rent of a shop and cellar only is \u00a3292 10s. ; the upper part of the house lets for \u00a3247 10s. Two mode- rate-sized houses in Wall-street were lately taken on lease, sor the purpose of being converted into an inn, at a rent of \u00a31,417 10s. per annum ; but not answering the expecta tions of the tenant, he put up at public auction a nine years lease, which was knocked down for \u00a32,587 10s. per annum ! Ground lots for building, even- in the suburbs, are enormously dear. Persons who are not housekeepers generally live at boarding-houses or hotels. A mechanic pays for his board and lodging 13s. 6d. a week, or, for better accommodation,"], [391, "371 STATE OF NEW YORK. 15s. 9d. ; for which he has three meals a day, coffee with fish or flesh meat for breakfast : a hot dinner ; and tea (called supper) in the evening ; at which last the table is filled with cheese, biscuits, molasses, and slices of dried beef. Boarding iu one of the genteel houses is eight dollars a week, for such as remain only a short time ; but at the same house, five or six dollars for a three or six months re sidence. Prices vary from eight to fourteen dollars a week, according to situation, respectability, and accommodation. Mrs. Bradish's boarding-house in State-street, is the best in New York, or perhaps in the United States ; the rent of this house is \u00a3540 sterling per annum, with taxes to the amount of \u00a318. Mechanics have good wages in this city ; but are not always certain of employment. House carpenters and masons are in greatest request, and better paid than most other callings; the former receiving 7s. 10\\d. per day, and the latter 8s. bd. English money. Tailors can earn from 36s. to 54s. ; but their trade is much injured by the employ ment of women and boys, who work from twenty-five to fifty per cent, cheaper than the men. A man that can cut out will be occasionally very well paid ; the women not being clever in this branch of the business, makes men more neces sary. When a journeyman works by the piece, for making a common coat he receives 18s. ; a best do. 27s. ; if he finds the trimmings, he is paid sor a superfine coat 45s. to 51s. ; for making trowsers, 9s. To carry on this trade as a master, with a prospect of success, will require a capital of from \u00a3500 to \u00a32,000; the profits are large, but long credit is given. The price of a coat made of best cloth is from \u00a37 4\u00ab. to \u00a38 2s. There are large quantities of cloth ing imported from England, and many persons have their regular London tailors. Black and coloured Chinese crape, black stuff, white jean, white drill and Nankin, are worn for trowsers ; all of which are made by women. Boot and shoemakers are numerous, some of them ex tensive. The price of sole leather is lid. to 14rf. ; of dressed upper ditto, 1 Is. 3d. to 15s. 9d. ; Wellington boots at the best shops are charged 40s. 6<_. ; shoes, 13s. 6d. Spanish leather is much used for uppers ; the shoes are made with taste, the workmanship appearing to be fully equal to that of London, and the American workmen not inferior to the English. A capital of from 500 to 1,000 dollar, is requisite in a moderate concern ; but it is not probable that a master shoemaker would be benefitted by moving to New York, though a journeyman would ; a first rate workman is capable of earning 45s. a week. 3 B"], [392, "372 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA Cabinet-making is a good business in this city, and in deed throughout the United States. When in full employ ment the earnings of a journeyman may amount to 54s. a Week ; but a safe average is 36s. Cabinet shops are nume rous, particularly in Greenwich-street ; containing a variety of articles, but not a large stock. They are generally small concerns, apparently owned by journeymen wbo have lately commenced on their own account. The retail price of a three feet six inch chest of drawers, well finish ed, and of good quality, is \u00a33 16s. 6d. ; ofa three feet ten, with brass rollers, \u00a35 8s. A table, three feet long, four and a half wide, \u00a33 7s. 6r/.; ditto with turned legs, \u00a34 5s. 6d.; three and a half long, four and a half wide, (plain) \u00a33 12s.; ditto, better finished, \u00a34 10s. ; ladies' work tables, very plain, 18s. Chests of drawers are chiefly made of St. Domingo mahogany, the inside faced with box wood ; but shaded veneer and curled maple (a native and most beauti ful wood) are also used for this purpose. Cabinet work in general is light and elegant; and there is some deco rated with cut glass instead of brass ornaments, which has A beautiful effect. A good cabinet-maker, who should have no more than \u00a3100, after paying the expenses of his voyage, would obtain a comfortable livelihood ; as would also an active speculating house carpenter or mason, under the same circumstances. A greater capital would, of course, be more advantageous. Mahogany is used for doors, cupboards, banisters, &c. ; that imported from Hon duras sells from 5\\d to l\\d. per superficial foot, and that from St. Domingo, from 9%d. to \\l\\d. Oak boards are \u00a35 12s. 6d. per 1,000 feet; shingles (a substitute for tiles or slates) \u00a31 2s. 6d. per 1,000 feet, to which is to be added a duty of fifteen per cent. A timber merchant should have a capital of at least \u00a31,000, as he ought to pay cash for his stock, with the exception of mahogany ; yards containing this article are generally separate concerns. Building, as before observed, is very brisk in this city, and is for the most part performed by contract. A person intending to have a house erected, contracts with a professed builder ; the builder with a bricklayer, and he, with all others necessary to the under taking. In some cases, a builder is a sort of head work man, for the purpose of overseeing the others ; receiving for his agency seven pence per day from the wages of each man ; the men being employed and paid by him. But there are some instances in which there is no contract, every thing being paid for according to measure and value. The builder is sometimes his own timber-merchant ;"], [393, "373 STATE OF NEW YORK. indeed all men here know a portion of, and enter a little into ever thing. Chair-making in New York, and at the town of Newark, ten miles distant, is an extensive and profitable business. The retail price of wooden chairs is from 4s. 6d. to 9s.; of curl maple with rush seat, 1 Is. ; of ditto with cane seat, 13s. 6d. to \u00a31 2s. 6d. ; of ditto most handsomely finished, \u00a31 9s. ; sofas, ofthe several descriptions above mentioned, are the price of six chairs. Journeymen's wage, fully equal to that of cabiuet-makers. There are here several large carvers' and gilders' shops, and glass mirrors and picture-frames are executed with taste and elegance ; but still the most superior are import- ed from England : carved decorations are general, though some composition ornaments are used. Plate glass is im- ported from France, Holland, and England; the latter bearing the highest price : silvering looking-glasses is a separate trade; but though there is only one silverer in New York, he' is not constantly employed. Carvers and gilders are paid Sld. per hour ; the latter would probably not succeed here : the former might do better : but neither trades are of the first rank, as to facility of procuring employment. The oil and colour business would probably be success- ful, and might be combined with that ofa tallow-chandler; who is prohibited from carrying on the operation of melt- ing contiguous to the thickly inhabited parts ofthe city. The rent of a house to suit an oil business, would be \u00a3135 to \u00a3150 per annum; aud a capital of from \u00a3800 to \u00a31,000. would be sufficient. For a journeyman or shopman it is a bad trade; they are paid 4s. 6d. to 5s. Id, per day, the chief work being done by apprentices. The wholesale- prices of foreign tallow is 6d. to l\\d. with a duty of \\d. ; of American, Id. ; of Castile soap, Sd. to 9d. ; turpentine, bid., with a duty of 1st.. In the eastern states there is abundance of native tallow, in the south jt is scarce ; and as barilla is not used, American ashes are substituted, which cost from Sd. to lid,- per bushel. A dyer is a tolerably good business, and would not require a capital of more than \u00a3200 to \u00a3500 ; a few jour- neymen are employed, who earn 45s, per week. From the state of the manufactures in America, the profession of a dyer is very different in that country to what it is in England ; and approaches nearer to that of an English scourer. The price of dyeing black or brown woollens is 3s. per yard, six-quarter wide ; red or yellow, 2s. 6d. ; scarlet, 20s. a pound. There is no silk dyed in the skein ,"], [394, "374 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA nor are there any silk weavers in the United States. Re-dyeing old silk is 6c.. per yard ; fast blue is not done. English allum is from 33_. 9<_ to 36s. per cwt., with a duty of 4s. 6d. ; brazilletto, 140s, to 160s. per ton; cochineal, 24s. 9d. per lb. with a duty of 7| per cent, ; logwood, 90s. to 112s. per ton. Clerks or shopmen are not in demand, neither in New York nor elsewhere throughout the states ; for as there are no very large concerns, most men are capable of attend ing to their own business. A person ofthe above descrip tion would here find much difficulty in procuring a situa tion ; and if one could be obtained, he wonld not receive more than from 15s. 9d. to 31s. 6d. a week exclusive of board and lodging. Printers are paid 45s. a week, when upon established wages; but employment cannot be de pended on, a great portion of the work being done by boys. Stereotyping is also largely practised, to the great injury of the compositors, without benesitting the public in the most remote degree. The Lancastrian system of education is practised in this city, as well as in many other parts of the United States; but it has not spread so rapidly as in England, because among the lower orders it was less wanted : there are 800 scholars in the school at New York. Day schools are numerous, and some of them respectable ; but none of them largo : an usher at any of the:?e establishments isa situation not worth the attention of the poorest man. No species of correction is ever allowed; for children, even at home, are perfectly independent. The proprietors of these seminaries are chiefly emigrants from Scotland and Ireland ; no English school master has yet established himself in the city. Two ladies from England have opened a boarding school sor females, and have been tolerably successful ; sor an undertaking of this kind a capital of from \u00a3100 to \u00a3500 is necessary, for a day-school none is required. The charges at several seminaries are, sor arithmetic, reading, and writing, per annum \u00a39 sterling; for geography, philosophy, and the French language, \u00a313 10s. ; for Greek, Latin, and the mathematics, \u00a318 : these charges are exclusive of board, The foregoing account of trades and professions in New York, and of the prospects of emigrants to that celebrated city, cannot be hotter concluded than by the observations of a late intelligent and judicious traveller, to whom we are indebted for much information on these interesting topics. ' The capitalist may manage to obtain seven per cent., with good security; the lawyer and"], [395, "375 STATE OF N_W YORK. doctor will not succeed, though an orthodox minister would. The proficient in the fine arts will find little encouragement ; the literary man must starve. The tutors' posts are preoccupied. The shopkeeper may do as well, but not better than in Loudon; unless he be a man of superior talents and large capital ; for such requi sites there is a fine opening. Mechanics whose trades are of the first necessity, will do well \u2022 those not such, or who understand only the cotton, linen, woollen, earth enware, glass, silk and stocking manufactures, cannot obtain employment in this city. The labouring man will prosper ; particularly if he has a wife and children, who are capable of contributing, not merely to the con suming, but to the earning also ofthe common stock.' It is estimated that there are 1500 spirit-shops in New Yor.k, and the quantity of malt liquor and spirits used by the inhabitants, greatly, exceeds the amount consumed by the same extent of English population ; still there are no drunkards to be seen in the streets, the beastly drinker being a character unknown here. Yet but too many throughout the day are under the influence of liquor ; a state too common among the labouring classes and blacks. The source of this evil is by some attributed to the ex tremes of the climate ; but the principal cause is, that a number of the lower orders are emigrants from Europe, and particularly from Great Britain and Ireland. These people carry their profligate habits along with them, and being much better paid for their labour in America than they were in their own country, and liquors being con siderably cheaper, they are enabled to indulge in their former practice of drunkenness, and to a much greater extent. All spirits are commonly drunk mixed with cold water, without sugar ; and the price per glass, at the lowest grog shops is 2d. : here the liquor is of a very in ferior quality. At the more respectable places, for a superior quality, 3\\d. ; at what are called taverns and porter houses, Id. This city is remarkably well situated for trade ; and is esteemed the most eligible commercial port in the United States. Having a spacious harbour, an easy access to the ocean, and being a central situation, it must necessarily always command a large share of the foreign trade of the country. Possessing the navigation of Hudson's river, which, with its branches, is navigable upwards of 200 miles, and the East river, with Long Island sound, it almost unavoidably commands the trade of one half of New Jersey, most of that of Connecticut, and part of tbat"], [396, "376 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. of Massachusetts; besides the whole ofthe fertile interior country, which, on the other hand, furnishes New York with every kind of produce and provisions by an easy water carriage, and at a reasonable rate. The merchants of this city import most of the goods consumed between a line of thirty miles east of Connecticut river, and twenty miles west ofthe Hudson, which is 130 miles, and between the ocean and the confines of Canada, aLo-tt 400 miles ; a great portion of which is better peopled than any other part of the Union. The whole value of exports for the year 1817, amounted to the sum of 18,707,433 dollars ; being above \u00a34,200,000 sterling. The following is a cor rect statement of the number of vessels entered aud cleared out of this port in the same year : Ships. Brigs. Sloops. Schooners, others. From Foreign ports.. ..29 1 361 42 266 6 966 Coastwise 81 166 1,284 935 3 2,469 Cleared out-Foreign 279 312 36 240 4 871 Coastwise 137 219 1,587 883 2 2,828 Since that period the shipping trade of New York has greatly increased ; during the last week of August, 1818, no less than fifty square rigged vessels from Europe entered the harbour. The city of New York is 230 miles north-east of Wash ington, 91 north-east of Philadelphia, 232 south-west of Boston, 191 north-east of Baltimore, 364 from Pittsburgh, 701 from Lexington, Kentucky ; 421 from Montreal, Lower Canada ; 774 from Charleston, South Carolina ; and 1564 (by land,) 2205 (by water) from New Orleans. The city of Albany is the seat of government for the state, and is-situated on the west side of Hudson's river, 170 miles from New York, to which it is next in rank; being a place of considerable trade, and fast rising into importance. By the last general census, taken in 1810^ the population was 9,356; at the commencement of 1819. the number of inhabitants amounted to upwards of 12,000. Albany is unrivalled for situation, being nearly at she, head of sloop navigation, on one of the noblest rivers in the world. It enjoys a pure air, and is the natural em porium of the increasing trade of a large extent of country west and north ; and when the Grand Western and Northern canals are completed, it will become the greatest commercial inland town in the United States, or perhaps in the world. In the old part of the towu the streets are very narrow, and the houses mean, being all built in the Dutch taste, with the gable end towards the"], [397, "377 STATE OF NEW YORK. street, and ornamented, or rather disfigured, on the top with large iron weathercocks; but in that part which has been lately erected, the streets are commodious, and many ofthe houses are handsome. The public buildings are an elegant Dutch church, one for episcopalians, two for presbyterians, one for Germans, one sor methodists, and one for Roman catholics; an hospital, city hall, and a handsome prison. The building in which the state legis lature meet, is called \"The Capitol;\" it stands on an elevation at the end of the main street, and presents a fine appearance. The inhabitants of this city, a few years since, were almost entirely of Dutch extraction, and it had then the character of being a very unsocial place ; but now strangers from all quarters are settling in it, and liberal sentiments, hospitality, and good manners, are rapidly gaining ground. The rent of a house and shop in Albany, in a good situation, is from 5 to 700 dollars per annum, and the taxes about twenty dollars. There are many small wooden houses, which are from 50 to 1 50 dollars a year, according to size and situation. Mechanics are paid the same here as at New York ; their board and lodging is three dollars a week. The markets are well supplied with excellent provisions; beef, mutton, and veal, are bd. to 6d. per lb. ; geese, 2s. Sd. each ; ducks, 13d. ; fowls, 8d. to 9d. ; but ter, lAd. a lb. ; potatoes, 20d. a bushel ; best flour, 45s. a barrel (196 lb.) ; fish, 3d. to 6d. a lb. ; rum and gin, 4s. 6d. a gallon ; brandy and hollands 9s. 6d. The conveyance by water between this city and New York has been brought to the highest degree of perfection. It is performed by packets, which carry horses, &c, and by steam-boats, for the convenience of passengers. One of these vessels, the \" Chancellor Livingstone,\"' is pro bably equalled by none in the world ; she may properly be termed a floating palace, affording all the elegant accom modations of a first-rate hotel. Her length is 175 feet, and breadth 50, and she is propelled by a sfeam-engine of eighty-horse power; there are beds for 160 persons, and settees provided for forty more : the ladies have a sepa rate cabin, entirely distinct from the gentlemen. On deck there are numerous conveniences, such as baggage rooms, smoking-rooms, &c. ; and on the descent to the cabins are placed cards of tradesmen, and of taverns and hotels in the chief cities, and also religious tracts in great abundance. The fare between the two cities is eight dollars, including board ; and an excellent table is at all times provided."], [398, "378 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. The city of Hudson is situated on the east side of Hudson river, thirty miles south of Albany, and 130 north of New York. It has had the most rapid growth of any place in the United States, except Baltimore ; for though only laid out in 1784, such has been its surprising pro gress, that by the last census the number of inhabitants amounted to 4,048, and at present the population is esti mated at upwards of 6*000. It is surrounded by an ex-1 tensive and fertile back country, is a place of very con siderable trade, and is rapidly increasing in wealth and importance. The town is planned in squares, formed by spacious streets, crossing each other at righi angles ; each square contains thirty lots, two deep, divided by a twenty feet alley, and each lot is fifty feet in front, and 120 in depth. The inhabitants are plentifully supplied with water, brought to their houses in wooden pipes from a spring two miles distanf. It stands upon an eminence, from which are extensive and delightful views, consisting of hills and valleys, variegated with woods and orchards, corn-fields, and meadows, with the noble river, which is in most places a mile broad, forming a number of fine bays and creeks. From the south-east to the south-west, the city is screened with hills, at different distances, and west afar off over the river and, a large valley, the pros pect is bounded by a chain of stupendous mountains, called the Catskill, being the first part of the Allegany chain of mountains, which adds magnificence and subli mity to the whole scene. Schenectady, sixteen miles north-west of Albany, is a handsome, well-built eity, on the Mohawk river, and by the last census contained 5,909 inhabitants. It is a place of brisk trade, and has a bank, a college, and three places for public worship, viz. a Dutch, a presbyterian, and an episcopal church. The annual expence of education at the college, including board, is less than 100 dollars. The chief business of this town is to receive the mer chandise from Albany, and put it into batteaux to go up the river, and forward to Albany the returns from the back country. The other most important towns and villages are New burgh, Poughkeepsie, Troy, Lansinburgh, and Waterford, on the Hudson ; Utica, Herkimer, and Rome, on the Mohawk ; and Seneateless, Geneva, Canandaigua, and Buffalo, to the westward. Of these, Buffalo, delightfully situated near the margin of lake Erie, 327 miles from Albany, and _2 from the falls of Niagara, promises to be _ place of great importance. It was laid out for a village"], [399, "379 STATE OF NEW YORK. about eleven years ago, and at the commencement of the late war was possessed of a considerable trade ; but in December, 1813, it was entirely destroyed by the British, (see page 248 :) since that time its growth has been rapidly increasing. It is now incorporated, and contains a bank, court-house, jail, post office, exchange, custom-house, two printing offices, a presbyterian church, and a public library. The whole number of buildings is about 250, and the population about 1,500; who are mostly emigrants from the eastern states. The principal streets are from 66 to 100 feet wide; these are intersected by others of equal width, and as many of the houses are of brick, two and three stories high, they make a neat and handsome appearance. Buffalo, standing on the great road leading from Albany to Ohio, possesses natural advantages for trade, equal, if not superior, to any internal place in the United States ; having at present a ship navigation for 1,000 miles west, through lakes Erie, Huron, and Michigan, and with little expence may be extended as much further: a boat navigation may likewise be easily opened to com- municate with the river Mississippi. Canandaigua, the principal town of Ontario county, is a delightful place, and has hitherto been the largest of any of the towns in this part of the state. It is distant 208 miles from Albany, and was laid out about thirty years ago upon ground which then cost from one to two dollars an acre, but which is now, by the improvement and progress of settlement, worth from 500 to 1,000 dol lars an acre for the town lots, and from 80 to 100 for the out lots : the land is rich, and all arable. As this town stands in the centre of a well settled country, it has a very considerable retail trade ; and though it is far from a market, yet it flourishes in an eminent degree. The inhabitants are chiefly engaged in agriculture, and have all the necessaries of life within themselves. Provisions are very reasonable : flour, five dollars a barrel ; beef, mutton, and veal, three to five cents per lb., and other things in proportion. There are good mechanics in the town, in the various branches calculated for the neigh bourhood, and they have high wages. The view of the country round Canandaigua, which may include the whole county of Ontario, is valuable, as it throws light upon the future destinies of that part of America, often known by the name of the back woods, or wilderness. This county is about forty miles long, by forty broad, and contains 1,760 square miles of territory, from which may be deducted sixty miles for water. In 3c"], [400, "380 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. the year 1790, it was actually a wilderness ; but the wilder ness has trnly been made to become a fruitful field, and to \" blossom like the rose.\" Twenty years after its first settlement it contained upwards of 42,000 inhabitants, being nearly twenty-five to the square miie ; and they are rapidly increasing in numbers, in wealth, in agriculture, in manufactures, and in the mechanic arts. In the same period the number of looms had increased to 1,903 ; there were also thirty-seven tan works, seventy-six distilleries, twenty fulling-mills, and twenty-two carding machines, besides some glass-works and potteries : cotton and woollen factories were also commenced near Canandaigua. Land which was originally bought at one dollar an acre, may now be sold at fifty sollars ; the average price of laud, partly cleared, is from eight to twenty-five dollars ; un cleared, four to six dollars ; but in the vicinity of villages, nearly ten dollars. Good horses, forty fo eighty dollars; qows twenty, and sheep two dollars. The vast increase of wealth in this county may be inferred from this circum stance, that Canandaigua, the site of which twenty years before, would have been reckoned dear at 2,000 dollars, wag estimated at the value of 212,485 dollars, and it has greatly increased since : probably the property is now worth 500,000 dollars. Utica, the chief town of Oneida county, is deserving of particular notice, from the importance of its situation, which is on the very route of the Grand Western canal fifteen miles distant from Rome, and ninety-six from Albany, at the head of navigation on the Mohawk river, over which there is a bridge opposite the town. The in crease of this place has been remarkable, even before the canal was projected. In 1794, there were only two houses on the spot where Utica now stands ; at present it contains 3,500 inhabitants, and upwards of 500 houses, two-thirds of which have been erected since 1800. The buildings are mostly of wood, painted white ; but a good many have been lately built of brick, and some of stone. The public edifices are four places for public worship, two of them elegant, an academy, clerk's office,&c. ; among the private concerns are three printing offices, two of which issue newspapers that have an extensive circulation. The town lots are from fifty to sixty feet front, and 100 to 130 feet deep, and sell from 300 to 1,200 dollars; tbe out-lots con tain twelve acres, and the price demanded for them is 5,500 dollars. House rent for mechanics is from sixty to 100 dollars, flour, eight dollars per barrel ; potatoes, twenty-five cen%"], [401, "381 STATE OF NEW YORK. per bushel ; onions, seventy-five cents ditto ; turnips, thirty one cents ditto, beans, sixty-two cents ditto ; beef, mutton, and veal, five cents per lb. ; venision, four cents; geese, fifty cents each ; ducks, twenty-five cents ; fowls, nine cents; turkeys, sixty-two cents; butter, twelve cents per Ib. ; cheese, seven cents ; beer five dollars per barrel ; whisky, forty-five cents per gallon, boarding two dollars and a half per week. Wheat is one dollar twelve cents per bushel; Indian corn, forty-four cents; horses, fifty to 100 dollars; cows, fifteen to twenty-two dollars; sheep, two dollars and a half. To prevent repetition under the article of markets, the above prices may be taken as a fair average of the rate of provisions throughout all the newly settled counties ofthe state. The commerce of Utica consists of dry goods, hard ware, and cotton, imported ; and of grain, flour, provision, ashes, &c. exported: the chief part of the trade is with the city of New York. Lands on the turnpike, in the vicinity of the town, sell from fifty to 100 dollars an acre ; at a greater distance, from forty to fifty dollars. The country is very thickly inhabited, and near the town the houses are so close as to resemble a continued village ; many of the houses are elegant, with fine orchards attached to them, and the plots of ground adjoining are fertile and highly cultivated. Manufactures of different kinds are making rapid progress ; but there are three branches that are likely to flourish in an eminent degree, namely, glass, woollen^and cotton, and they will be of great importance to this town. For the latter branch, the raw material can always be had nearly one half lower than in Europe ; and workmen daily arriving at New York from Great Britain, can be brought here in a few days at a small expense. The trade with the back country is secure to a very large ex tent, and provisions must be for ever cheap at Utica. Trade, manufactures, agriculture, &c. \u2014 The situation ofthe state of New York, with respect to foreign markets, has decidedly the preference to any of the other states; and in consequence its commerce is exceedingly extended. Having an easy access to the ocean, it commands the trade ofthe best cultivated parts ofthe United States. The ex ports are, biscuit, peas, Indian corn, apples, onions, boards, staves, horses, sheep, butter, cheese, beef, and pork ; but wheat is the staple commodity of the state, of which no less than 677,700 bushels, with 2,828 tons of flour, and 2;555 tons of bread, were exported in one year nearly"], [402, "382 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. half a century ago. The increase since has been in pro portion to the increase of population. Besides the articles already enumerated, are exported flax-seed, cotton wool, sarsaparilla, coffee, indigo, rice, pig-iron, bar-iron, pot ash, furs, deer-skins, logwood, fustic, mahogany, bees-wax, oil, Madeira wine, rum, tar, pitch, turpentine, fish, sugars, salt, molasses, tobacco, lard, &c. ; but most of these articles are imported for re-exportation : the total amount of exports for the year 1817 will be found in page 83. This state owned in 1792, 46,626 tons of shipping ; but in 1810 the tonnage had increased to 276,557 tons, being more than double that of Pennsylvania. The manufactures of the state are considerable and in creasing ; particularly the articles of glass, ashes, iron ware, of various descriptions, leather of all kinds, hats, carriages, paper and printed books, pottery-ware, umbrel las, mathematical and musical instruments, &c. &c. Most of all these articles are manufactured in the city of New York, with the addition of clocks, watches, shoes and boots, saddlery, silver plated ware, (in which there are above 1,200 hands employed,) cabinet work, ships, and every thing necessary for their equipment. In this latter branch, the construction of steam-boats forms an important article ; and these vessels are certainly brought to great perfection. The \" Chancellor Livingstone\" has been already described, and the \" Connecticut\" and \" Fulton,\" one of which sails to Newhaven, and the other to New London, are little inferior. They have each two cabins for gentlemen, one for ladies, a very extensive kitchen, and other conveniences ; and are fisted up with minute attention to accommodation, and with much elegance. The \" Fulton\" was built for the emperor of Russia, and was to have been navigated across the Atlantic by captain Hall, who captured the English frigate Guerriere; but proving too small, another of larger size is now building for the same destination. A line of battle ship is on the stocks, and the Adams frigate undergoing repairs ; besides which, there are two frames of frigates deposited in the navy yard, with large quantities of other timber for ship build ing, iron, copper, and guns. The following statement of manufactures in the state of New York, was returned at the last general census ; and though it is certainly incorrect, yet it will convey to the Teader some useful information on that important subject: Looms, 33,068 ; tan works, 867 ; distilleries, 591 ; breweries, 42 ; fulling-mills, 427 ; paper mills, 28; hat factories, 124; glassworks, 6; powder-mills, 2; rope walks, 18; sugar"], [403, "383 STATF. OF NEW YORK. houses, 10 ; oil mills, 28 ; blast furnaces, 1 1 ; air ditto, 10 ; forges, 48 ; cut nail factories, 44 ; trip hammers, 49 ; rolling and slitting mills, 1 ; carding machines, 413. \u2014 Total value of manufactures in the above establishments 12,085,525 dollars. At the same period there were twenty-six cotton factories, not included above ; nor was there any return of tow cloth, except for two counties, and instead of one rolling and slitting mill, there were not less than twelve then iu the state. The nail, hat, paper, and rope factories, furnaces, &c, much exceeded the number returned; and all the woollen factories were omitted- The single county of Rensselaer manufactured at that time woollen goods to the amount of 600,000 dollars ; and many new factories, in Oneida especially, and throughout the western counties generally, were then just going into operation, many of which are now flourishing. The following description of a cotton manufactory on the banks of the Hudson, will nearly apply to most other similar establishments in this part of the United States : It was erected about five years since, and is in a prosperous condition: there are 1,600 spindles in operation. Men are paid 31s. 6d. sterling per week ; women 1 Is. 3d. and children 3s. 4_e_ Every part ofthe machinery is manufactured on the premises. There is also a general shop or store, on the ground floor, at which the people are supplied with whatever they may want, in payment of their wages. The principal articles made are the same as at Patucket, described in page 313; and though they are by no means so well finished as they would be in Great Britain, yet the fabric is stronger than ours, and will wear much longer. The annual value of salt made in this state amounts to above 150,000 dollars; and in Cayuga county about 2,500 skeins of silk are produced: to all which may be added 60,000 dollars, the value of articles annually made by con victs in the state prison. The agriculture of the state of New York is far ad vanced in a state of improvement. Besides an immense quantity of wheat, the principal article of culture, all the other kinds of grain and pulse mentioned in the account of the eastern states, are raised in great abundance. The introduction of plaster of Paris as a manure, and other improvements in their husbandry, have greatly increased the annual produce ; but nothing has tended so much to advance the progress of tillage, as the establishment of an agricultural society, and the distribution of 30,000 dollars annually in premiums for the encouragement of farming. In Long Island, within the last fourteen years, land has"], [404, "384 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. risen in value twenty-five per cent. ; and is now worth from \u00a33 7s. 6d. to \u00a333 15s. sterling per acre. A choice of farms may now be purchased at from \u00a315 15s. to \u00a322 10s. per acre, including necessary buildings. Farmers here have seldom any money in reserve, and yet they do not live extravagantly. The agriculturist, who alone can, in this island, entertain rational hopes of profit, must have sons that will work, and be himself amongst the foremost to labour with his own hands. There being no tax upon horses, their labour is preferred, and mules or asses are seldom or ever used. The breed of horses is good, but not large : oue fit for a waggon is worth \u00a322 10s. sterling ; a saddle horse, \u00a335 ; gig horse, \u00a333 15s. to \u00a356 5s. ; carriage, or riding do. \u00a390 to \u00a3120. Cows are worth, (lean,) \u00a39 ; fat, \u00a311 5s. to \u00a313 10s. Pigs are sold, per lb. alive, at about Id. ; sheep, 9s. each, but they are very small ; a sheep when fattened for market, is 13s. 6d. A good farm eart is worth \u00a37 to \u00a39 ; a ditto waggon, \u00a322 to \u00a323 ; a farmer's man servant, \u00a324 to \u00a330, (besides board, &c.) a ditto woman servant, \u00a312 to \u00a316. Early wheat is cut in the middle of July ; the wheat and rye harvest is completed by the end of August ; oats, a fortnight earlier ; buck wheat and Indian corn, in Octo ber ; grass, from the 1st to the end of July. The seed for winter, rye and wheat, is sown from the end of August to the end of September. The law of this state provides \" for the free exercise and enjoyment of religious profession and worship, without discrimination or preference within the state, for all man kind. Provided that the liberty of conscience hereby granted, shall not be so construed as to excuse acts of licentiousness, or justify practices inconsistent with the peace and safety of the state.\" The various religious de nominations are the following : English presbyterians, Dutch reformed, baptists, episcopalians, friends, or qua kers, German Lutherans, Moravians, methodists, Roman catholics, Jews, shakers, and a few of the followers of Jemima Wilkinson. In April, 1784, an act was passed by the legislature, enabling all religious denominations to appoint trustees, who shall be a body corporate, for the purpose of taking care of the temporalities of their re spective congregations, and for other purposes therein mentioned. The ministers of every sect in the state are supported by the voluntary contribution of the people, raised generally by subscription, or by a tax on the pews ; except the Dutch churches in New York, Schenectady, and Kingston, which have, except the two last, large estates"], [405, "385 STATE OF NEW YORK. confirmed by charter. The episcopal church also in New York possesses a very large estate in and near the city. The manners of the people in this state differ consider ably, as does their language. The inhabitants whose fore fathers were natives of England, follow the customs of their ancestors ; and in like manner, those descended from the Dutch are distinguished for neatness, parsimony, and industry. The English language is generally spoken throughout the state, but is a good deal corrupted by the Dutch dialect, which is still spoken in some counties, particularly in King's, Ulster, Albany, and a part of Orange; but as Dutch schools are almost wholly discon tinued, that language, in a few generations, will probably be entirely disused. The manners and character of the inhabitants of every colony or state will take their colour ing, in a greater or less degree, from the peculiar manners of the first settlers. Hence it is that the cleanliness, fru gality, and diligence of the Dutch people were early imita ted by the first English settlers in the province, and until the revolution, formed a distinguishing trait in their cha racter. It is still discernible, though in a much less de gree, and will probably continue visible for many years. Besides the Dutch and English already mentioned, there are in this state many emigrants from Scotland, Ireland, Germany, and some from France ; a great number of Germans are settled on the Mohawk river, and several Scots people on the Hudson, particularly in the county of Washington. Constitution. \u2014 This state sends two senators and seven teen representatives to congress. The state government is vested in a governor, lieut, -governor, senate, and house of representatives. The governor and lieut. -governor are elected for three years, the senators for four, and the re presentatives are chosen annually. Every male inhabit ant of full age, who has resided in one of the counties of the state for six months preceding the election, and who has possessed a freehold of the value of \u00a320, or who has rented a tenement of 40s. a year within that time, and has actually paid taxes, votes for the representatives. The occupiers of freeholds of \u00a3100 value, vote for the senators. The method of voting is now by ballot, but subject to alteration by the legislature. History. \u2014 It has been already stated (page 10) that Henry Hudson, who, in 1608, first discovered the river"], [406, "386 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. which bears his name, sold his claim to the Dutch. Ac- cordingly, the colony of New York was originally settled by them, and named the New Netherlands; and in 1614 they erected a fort near the present city of Albany, and named it fort Orange. King Charles II. , in 1664, resolved upon the conquest of this country, and granted to his brother, the duke of York, the region extending from the western banks of Connecticut to the eastern shore of the Delaware, together with Long Island, conferring on him the civil and military powers of government. Colonel Nicolls was sent with four frigates and 300 soldiers to effect the business ; and the Dutch governor being unable to resist, surrendered New Amsterdam, which was chang- ed fo New York, as was fort Orange to Albany, in honour of James duke of York and Albany. Very sew of the Dutch inhabitants thought proper to remove out of the country ; aud their numerous descendants are still in many parts of this state and New Jersey. In July, 1673, the Dutch repossessed themselves ofthe province, by attack- ing it suddenly when in a defenceless state ; but by the peace in February following, it was restored, and remained in the hands ofthe English until the American revolution. But though New York was regained, the inhabitants were again enslaved to the will of the conqueror; sor being admitted fo no share in the legislature, they were subject to laws to which they had never assented. To be relieved from a servitude that had degraded the colony, the council, the court of assizes, and the corporation, concurred in soliciting the duke of York \"to permit them to participate in the legislative power.\" In 1682, the duke, (though strongly prejudiced against democratic assemblies,) hoping that the inhabitants would agree to raise money to discharge the public debt, informed the lieut. -governor that he \" intended to establisb the same form of government as the other plantations enjoyed.\" Accordingly, colonel Dongan was appointed governor in September, and instructed to call an assembly, composed of a council of ten, and a house of representatives, to consist of eighteen members, chosen by the freeholders. This assembly was empowered to make laws for the peo ple, agreeably to the laws of England ; which should be of no force, however, without the ratification ofthe duke. Thus the inhabitants of New York, after being twenty years governed by arbitrary power, and at the mere will of deputies, were at length admitted to a share in the legislature. The assembly commenced their proceedings by passing au act of naturalization, and an act \"declaring"], [407, "387 STATE OF NEW YORK. the liberties of the people;\" also one for defraying the requisite charges of government for a limited time.\" In 1684, the legislature was again called together, when it explained the last act ; these seem to have been the only assemblies that met prior to the revolution in 1688: for when the duke of York became king of England, he re fused to confirm that grant of privileges to which as duke he had agreed. He established a real tyranny, and re duced New York once more to the deplorable condition ofa conquered province. In 1689, governor Dongan being called home by king James, and a general disaffection to government prevailing in the colony, one Jacob Leister took possession of the garrison of New York, and under pretence of acting for king William and queen Mary, assumed the supreme power over the province. This year the French wishing to detach the six confederated Indian nations from the English interest, sent out several detachments against the British colonies. On the 8th of February, 1690, one of these parties, supported by a number of Indians, entered the village of Schenectady at eleven o'clock on Saturday night, when all the inhabitants were in bed. The enemy, dividing themselves into small parties of six or seven men, entered the houses and commenced the most inhuman barbarities. The whole village was instantly in a blaze, women with child ripped open, and their infants cast into the flames, or dashed against the posts of the doors. Sixty persons perished in the massacre, and twenty-seven were carried into captivity ; the rest fled naked to Albany, sixteen miles distant, through a deep snow, which fell that very night in a terrible storm ; and twenty-five of the fugitives lost their limbs through the severity of the frost. The news of this dreadful tragedy reached Albany about break of day, and universal dread seized the inhabitants ; the enemy being reported to be 1,400 strong. A party of horse was immediately despatched to Schenectady, which had been completely plundered by the invaders, who had retreated with their booty, including forty of the best horses ; the rest, with all the cattle they could find, lay slaughtered in the streets. Upon the arrival of a governor at New York, commis sioned by the king, Leister imprudently refused to sur render the garrison, for which he and his were con demned to death, as guilty of high treason. The whole province having been originally settled by dissenters, chiefly presbyterians, except a few episcopal families in the city of New York, a violent dispute arose NO. XVII. 3 D"], [408, "388 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. between the former and the latter in 1693, when colonel Fletcher, then governor of the province, projected the scheme of a general tax for building churches, and sup porting episcopal ministers. This overture laid the foun dation ofa quarrel between the two religions sects, which, until the revolution, in 1776, was maintained on both sides with great animosity. In 1709, a vigorous expedition was meditated against Canada, in preparing for which this province expended above \u00a320,000 ; but the expected assistance from Britain failing, it was never prosecuted. Two years afterwards, however, a considerable fleet was sent over for the pur pose ; but eight transports having been cast away upon the coast, the rest of the fleet and troops returned, with out making any attempt to reduce Canada. In the same year governor Hunter brought over with him about 3,000 Germans, who had fled to England from the rage of per secution in their own country. Many of these people settled in the city of New York ; others fixed upon a tract of several thousand acres in the manor of Livingstone, on the banks ofthe Hudson ; and some went to Pennsylvania, and were instrumental in inducing thousands of their countrymen to emigrate to that province. In 1720, the probibition of the sale of Indian goods to the French, excited the clamour of the merchants at New York, whose interest was affected by it. About the same time, a trading house was erected by the English at Oswego, on lake Ontario, and another by the French at Niagara. In 1729, the act prohibiting the trade between Albany and Montreal, which had been promoted by the prohibi tion nine years before, was imprudently repealed by king George II. This naturally led to undermine the trade at Oswego, and to advance the French commerce at Niagara; and at the same time to alienate the affections of the Indians from Britain. Not long after this, the French were permitted to erect a fortress at lake Champlain. To prevent the ill consequences of this, a scheme was pro jected to settle the lands near lake George with loyal protestant Highlanders from Scotland. A tract of 30,000 acres was accordingly promised to captain Campbell, who at his own expense transported eighty-three protestant families to New York ; but, through the sordid views of some persons in power, who aimed at a share in the in tended grant, the settlement was never made. Most of the important events that have taken place in this state during the revolutionary war, and since that period, having been already mentioned in the general"], [409, "389 STATE OF NEW JERSEY. history of the United States, it would swell this Work beyond its proposed limits to enter further into detail. The following particulars relative to this important section of the Union shall therefore close the history of New York : \u2014 Embracing the head-waters of the river Ohio, and two other large rivers wliich pass southerly through other states, the entire course of one of the finest rivers in the world, together with twenty other navigable streams, this state affords the best passage in the United States, both byland and water, from tide-waters to the extensive lakes ofthe west; nor is there a mountain, or any great un avoidable hill, to pass between Albany and lake Erie, a distance of 300 miles. It is the only state, too, (except at the narrow and north-east extremity,) which extends across the whole width of the United States territory ; and the only spot on whieh the Atlantic and the great iakes can be united by sloop navigation. This peculiar situa tion, with its other advantages, render this state highly interesting to the politician, the man of business or enters prise, the emigrant, and the traveller. STATE OF NEW JEESEY. Situation, Boundaries, and Extent. This state is situated between 38\u00b0 56' and 41\u00b0 20' N. lat. and 1\u00b0 33' and 3\u00b0 5' E. long It is bounded on the north by the state of New York ; south, by Delaware bay ; west, by Delaware bay and river, which divide it from the states of Pennsylvania and Delaware; and east, by New York and the Atlantic ocean. Its length is 138, and its breadth 50 miles ; containing 6,660 square miles ; or 4,224,000 acres. Bays, and rivers, &c. \u2014 New Jersey is washed on the east and south-east by Hudson's river and the ocean ; and on the west by the river Delaware. The principal bays are Arthur-Kull, or Newark-bay, formed by the union of Passaic and Haekensack rivers ; this bay opens to the right and left, and embraces Staten Island. There is a long bay, formed by a beach four or five miles from the shore, extending along the coast from Manasquand river, in Monmouth county, almost to Cape May. Through this beach are a number of inlets, by which the bay com municates with the ocean."], [410, "390 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. The rivers in this state, though not large, are numerous. A traveller, in passing the common road from New York to Philadelphia, crosses three considerable rivers, viz. the Hackensack and Passaic between Bergen and Newark, and the Raritan by Brunswick. The Hackensack rises in the state of New York, and running a south-east course four or five miles west of Hudson's river, falls into the head of Newark-bay, and is navigable fifteen miles up the country. The Passaic river rises in Morris county, and running upwards of fifty miles by a very winding course, joins the Hackensack at Newark-bay; it is navigable about ten miles, and is 230 yards wide at its entrance into the bay. About fourteen miles from its outlet, where the river is nearly 120 feet broad, there are falls on it above seventy feet perpendicular, which form a great curiosity, and constitute a fine situation for mill-seats, at which a large cotton and other manufactories have been establish ed, (see page 95). The Raritan is one of the most con siderable rivers of New Jersey. It is formed by two streams, dne of which rises in Morris, and the other in Hunterdon county. After running a south-east course of about thirty miles, it falls into Raritan-bay, and helps to form the fine harbour of Amboy. It is a mile wide at its mouth, and is navigable about sixteen miles, by which means a great trade is carried on with New York. Besides these are Cesarea river, which rises in Salem county, and running about thirty miles, falls into Delaware river, opposite Bombay-hook. It is navigable for vessels of 100 tons to Bridgetown, twenty miles from its mouth. Mullicas river divides the counties of Gloucester and Burlington, and is navigable twenty miles for vessels of sixty tons. Maurice river rises in Gloucester county, runs southwardly about forty miles, and is navigable for vessels of 100 tons fifteen miles, and for shallops ten miles farther. Alloway creek, in Salem county, is navigable sixteen miles for shallops, with several obstructions of drawbridges. Annoocr.s creek, in Burlington county, is also navigable sixteen mites. These, with many other smaller streams, empty into the Delaware, and carry down the produce which their fertile banks and the neighbouring country afford. That part of the state which borders on the sea is indented with a great number of small rivers and creeks, such as Great Egg harbour, and Little Egg harbour rivers, Navesink, Shark, Matiricung, and Forked rivers, which, as the country is flat, are navigable for small craft almost to their sources."], [411, "391 STATE OF NEW JERSEY. Climate, face of the country, soil, and productions. \u2014 The climate is strikingly dissimilar in different sections of the state. In the northern parts there is clear, settled weather, and the winters are exceedingly cold ; but the whole is very healthy. In the districts towards tbe south, particularly near the extremity, the weather approaches nearly to that of the southern states, and is subject to very sudden changes. Tbe counties of Sussex, Morris, and part of Bergen are mountainous, being crossed by the Blue Ridge, a part of the Alleganies, running through Pennsylvania; and shoot ing off ia different directions from this ridge, there are several other small mountains in the neighbourhood. That part of the state which lies towards the sea, with the exception of the high lands of Navesink, is extremely flat and sandy, and for miles together covered with pine trees alone, usually called \" pine barrens,\" and is very little cultivated. The middle part, whicb is crossed in going from Philadelphia to New York, abounds with ex tensive tracts of good land, but the soil varies consider ably ; in some places being sandy, in others stony, and in others consisting of a rich brown mould. This part of the state as far as Newark, is well cultivated, and there are many excellent farm houses ; still a considerable quantity of land remains uncleared. Beyond Newark the country is extremely flat and marshy. Between the town and Passaic river there is one marsh, which alone extends upwards of twenty miles, and is about two miles wide where the road is carried over it. From the Passaic to Hudson's river the country is hilly, and unfruitful. Taking New Jersey altogether, not less than one-fourth of the whole state is a sandy barren, unfit for cultivation. Tbe land on the sea-coast in this, as in the southern states, has every appearance of made ground. The soil is gene rally a light sand, and by digging about fifty feet below the surface, which can be done, even at the distance of thirty miles from the sea, without any obstruction from stones, you come to salt marsh and sea shells. The good land in the southern counties lies principally on the banks ofthe creeks and rivers. The soil on these banks is gene rally a stiff clay, and while in a state of nature, produces a variety of oak, hickory, poplar, chesnut, ash,&c. ; the bar rens produce little else but shrub oaks, and white and yellow pines. There are large bodies of salt meadow along the river Delaware, which afford a plentiful pasture for cattle in summer, and hay in winter ; but the flies and musquetos frequent these meadows in large swarms, in the"], [412, "392 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. months of June, July, and August, and prove very troublesome both to man and beast. In Gloucester and Cumberland counties are several large tracts of banked meadow ; and their vicinity to Philadelphia renders them highly valuable. Along the sea-coast the inhabitants sub sist principally by seeding cattle on the salt meadows, and by the fish of various kinds, which the seas and rivers afford in great abundance. They raise Indian corn, rye. potatoes, &c. but not for exportation ; their swamps afford lumber which is easily conveyed to a good market. In the hilly and mountainous parts of the state, which are not too rocky for cultivation, the soil is of a stronger kind, and covered in its natural state with fine oaks, hickory, chesnut, &c. ; and when cultivated produces wheat, rye, Indian corn, buck-wheat, oats, barley, flax, and fruits of all kinds common to the climate. The land in this hilly country is good for grazing, and the farmers feed great numbers of cattle for New York and Phila delphia markets ; many of them keep extensive dairies. The orchards are equal to any in the United States, and the cider is perhaps the best in the world ; it is pretty certain that it cannot be surpassed in goodness. The markets of New York and Philadelphia receive a very considerable proportion of their supplies from the con tiguous parts of New Jersey. These supplies consist of vegetables of many kinds, .apples, pears, peaches, plums, strawberries, cherries, and other fruits ; cider in large quantities, and of the best quality, butter, cheese, beef, pork, mutton, and the lesser meats. The mineral productions of this state are chiefly iron and copper ore. The iron ore is of two kinds, one of which is capable of being manufactured into malleable iron, and is found in mountains and in low barrens; the other, called bog-ore, is dug from rich bottoms, and yields iron of a hard, brittle quality, and is commonly manufactured into hollow ware, and used sometimes in stead of stone in building. A number of copper mines have been discovered in different parts of the state ; par ticularly in the neighbourhood of New Brunswick, where one of a very rich quality was found in the year 1751. Repeated attempts have been made to work it ; but whether the price of labour be too great for such an undertaking, or the proprietors have not proceeded with judgment, certain it is, that they have always miscarried, and sustained considerable losses thereby : though the vein of copper in the mine is said to be much richer than when first opened. A lead mine has been discovered in"], [413, "393 STATE OF NEW JERSEY. Hunterdon county, coals in the county of Somerset, and turf near the town of Bethlehem, and also at Springfield, in Burlington county. There are mineral springs in Morris and Hunterdon counties, the latter near the top of a mountain ; these waters are greatly resorted to by invalids from every quarter. Civil divisions, towns, population, religion, character, &c. \u2014 New Jersey is divided into thirteen counties, and 116 townships, containing, by the last census, 245,562 in habitants, including 10,851 slaves; being about thirty-six to the square mile. This state would have been much more populous ; but since the year 1783 great numbers of the inhabitants have emigrated to the western country. The increase of population will therefore be small so long as these emigrations shall continue ; and they will pro bably continue while there are unsettled lands in the Uuited States, on which emigrants can more easily sub sist than in their native state.

It is a handsome town, standing nearly in the centre of tbe state from north to south, and at the head of sloop navigation ; the river not being navigable above the falls, except for boats carrying from five to 700 bushels of wheat. Here the legislature statedly meets, the supreme eourt sits, and most of the public offices are kept. This town being a thoroughfare between the eastern parts of the"], [414, "394 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. state and Philadelphia, and also between New York and that city, enjoys a considerable inland trade. The streets are very commodious, and the houses neatly built. The public buildings are, the state- house, an episcopal church, a presbyterian church, a quaker, and a methodist meeting house, ln the neighbourhood of this pleasant town are a number of gentlemen's seats, finely situated on the banks of the river, and ornamented with taste and elegance. Trenton bridge, over the Delaware, is perhaps the most beautiful structure of the kind in the United States. It consists of five arches of 194 feet span each, built of white pine timber, and supported on strong stone piers : the whole length is 970 feet, the breadth thirty-six. The arches are elevated over-head by substantial rafters, and the platform, or carriage-way, is suspended by these arches, and forms a plane the whole length of the bridge. Above the top of the arches the roof is covered in, so as to secure the whole from the weather ; and the carriage way is divided into two sections, each of which is appro priated to travellers in one direction. At the entrance, passengers are directed to take the road on the right hand. Brunswick is an incorporated city, on the south-west bank of the Raritan river, in a low situation, and not very handsome ; bpt it seems to be improving. This town was originally settled by Dutch people, who still compose one half of the inhabitants ; and have here three Dutch churches: the other public buildings worthy of notice, are the court-house and academy, which last is a very thriving seminary. One of the most elegant and expensive bridges in the United States has been built over the river opposite to this city. The lands in the neigh bourhood appear rough and rocky; nevertheless very good crops are raised, particularly of grass, in conse quence of applying plaster of Paris as a manure. The inhabitants have a considerable inland trade, and a num ber of small vessels belong to the port. Newark, the capital of Essex county, is a beautiful town, ten miles from the city of New York, pleasantly situated at a small distance from Passaic river, near its mouth in Newark-bay. It is regularly laid out in broad streets, on a fine plain, and contains a great number of excellent houses. The public buildings are, an episcopal church, two presbyterian churches, one of which is the largest and most elegant building of the kind in the state, a court-house, and an academy. It is a manufacturing town of considerable importance : carriages and chairs are"], [415, "395 STATE OF NEW JERSEY. made on a very extensive scale ; but the principal manu- facture is shoes, of which above 200 pairs are made daily throughout the year. The inhabitants have a pretty exten- sive inland trade, and a bank to assist their commercial operations. The adjacent country is highly cultivated, and it produces excellent cider ; of which large quantities are made here annually. Burlington city stands on the banks of the Delaware, eighteen miles north-east from Philadelphia, and eleven south-west from Trenton. The main streets are con- veniently spacious, and mostly ornamented with rows of trees in the fronts of the houses, which are regularly arranged. The river opposite the town is about a mile wide, and under shelter of two islands, affords a safe and convenient harbour ; but, though well situated for trade, Burlington is too near the opulent city of Philadelphia to admit of any considerable increase of foreign commerce. The societies of friends, episcopalians, methodists, and baptists have spacious and neat buildings for public wor- ship ; there are also two academies, a free school, a city hall, public library, a jail, a large brewery, and an excel- lent distillery ; if that can be called excellent which pro 'duces a poison both of health and morals. Princeton is handsomely situated on elevated ground, partly in Middlesex and partly in Somerset counties, fifty- three miles from New York, and forty from Philadelphia. It contains about 100 houses, a presbyterian church, and .a celebrated college, which has produced a great number of eminent scholars. This institution is well endowed, and once possessed a valuable philosophical apparatus and a library ; both of which were almost entirely destroyed by the British army during the revolutionary war. Be- sides the towns already mentioned, there are Elizabeth- town, Perfh-Amboy, Shrewsbury, Middleton, &c. ; none of which merit a particular description. The principal religious denominations in this state are presbyterians and quakers, wbich are nearly equal in num- ber ; the other sects are baptists, episcopalians, Dutch re- formed, methodists, and a settlement of Moravians. All these live together in peace and harmony, and worship the Almighty agreeably to the dictates of their consciences ; they are not compelled to attend or support any worship contrary to their own faith and judgment. All protestant inhabitants of peaceable behaviour, are eligible to the civil offices of the state. Learning has not been attended to in this state according to its importance ; for though there are numerous seminaries for the higher branches of 3E"], [416, "396 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. education, yet there is a lamentable deficiency of common schools. Besides the college at Princeton, there is an other at Brunswick called Queen's college, and academies at Freehold, Trenton, Hackinsack, Orangedale, Elizabeth town, Burlington, and Newark ; and grammar schools at Springfield, Morristown, Bordentown, and Amboy. The usual mode of education throughout the country has hitherto been, for the inhabitants of a village or neigh bourhood to join in affording a temporary support for a schoolmaster. But the encouragement wliich these occa sional teachers meet with is generally such, as that no person of abilities adequate to the business will under take it; and of course little advantage has been derived from these schools : the improvement of the scholars being generally in proportion to the pay ofthe teacher. The character of the inhabitants is by a concurrence of circumstances, rendered various in different parts of the state. The country in general is settled with frugal and industrious farmers, who, except in the towns, make the greater part of their own clothing. The population is composed of Dutch, Germans, English, Scottish, Irish, and New Englanders,\" or their descendants. National attachment, and mutual convenience, have for the most part induced these several kinds of people to settle toge ther in a body ; and in this way their peculiar national manners, customs, and character, are still preserved ; especially among the working classes, who have little intercourse with any but those of their own nation. Reli gion also, though it never produces any controversies in this free and happy country, yet occasions wide differ ences as to habits, usages, and even morals. There is like wise another very perceptible difference, which arises from the intercourse of the inhabitants with different states. The people of West Jersey trade to Philadelphia, and of course imitate their fashions, and imbibe their manners. Thecitizens of East Jersey trade to New York, and regulate their fashions and manners according to those of that great mercantile city : so that the difference in regard to cus toms and fashions between East and West Jersey is nearly as great as between New York and Philadelphia. It may, however, in truth be said, that the people of New Jersey are generally industrious, frugal, friendly, and hospitable. Trade, manufactures, agriculture, &c\u2014 This state has hardly any foreign commerce, nearly the whole being carried on through the medium of those two great com-"], [417, "397 STATE OF NEW JERSEY. teercial cities, Philadelphia on the one side, and New York on the other. The principal sea-ports are Amboy and Burlington ; but the direct exports amount to only a few thousand dollars annually, as may be seen by referring to page 83. The articles exported are wheat, flour, horses, live cattle, hams, (which are celebrated for their excel lence,) lumber, flax seed, leather, iron in great quantities, in pigs and bars ; and formerly copper ore was reckoned among their most valuable exports ; but the mines have not been worked to any advantage for several years. The imports consist chiefly of dry and West India goods, with teas, &c. from the East Indies ; all of which are supplied through the large cities already mentioned. The manufactures of this state were for many years greatly neglected, and very inconsiderable, before tho establishment of the extensive works on the Passaic river in 1791, already described. But the iron manufacture is of all others the greatest source of wealth to the state; and is carried on to a vast extent in Gloucester, Burling ton, Morris, Sussex, and other counties. The mountains in the county of Morris give rise to a number of streams, necessary and convenient for these works, and at the same time furnish a copious supply of wood, and ore ofa superior quality. In this county alone iron ore might be raised sufficient to supply all the United States; there are now eight or ten rich mines in operation, and to work the ore into iron there are furnaces, rolling and slitting-mills, and many forges, containing from two to four fires each. These works produce annually about 600 tons of bar iron, and l,0Q0tons of pigs; besides large quantities of hollow ware, sheet iron, and nail rods. In the whole state it is supposed there is yearly made about 1,500 tons of bar iron, the same quantity of pigs, and 100 tons of nail rods, ex-. elusive of hollow ware, and various other castings, of which vast quantities are produced. Besides the iron manufacture, there are those of leather, glass, and paper to a considerable amount. In Trenton, Newark, and Elizabethtown, are several very valuable tan-yards, where much leather, and of an excellent quality, is made and exported to tbe neighbouring mar kets. Glass is manufactured in Gloucester county ; and in several parts of the state paper-mills and nail manu factories are established, and worked to good account. In the western counties, wheat is made into flour, and Indian corn into meal, and both are sold to great advan tage, particularly the former, wheat being the staple com* modify of those districts."], [418, "398 UN.TED STATES OF AMERICA. The produce of the state is wheat, rye, barley, oats, Indian corn, potatoes, and other vegetables, with a vast quantity of fruit ; and butter and cheese to a great amount, for the supply ofthe New York and Philadelphia markets. But though the bulk of the inhabitants are farmers, yet agriculture has not been improved to that degree, which the fertility of the soil, in many places, seems to encou rage. A great proportion of the people are Dutch, who, although they are neat and industrious in the management of their farms, have very little taste for improvements; because through habits, and want of education, they think their old modes of husbandry the best. This has long been the case with the great body of the common people, and has hitherto proved a powerful obstacle to the pro gress of agriculture ; but of late years, the example of the more intelligent occupiers of land have had a most bene ficial influence on their less enterprising neighbours, and a spirit of agricultural improvement seems to prevail amongst farmers of every description throughout the state of New Jersey. Constitution. \u2014 The government of this state is vested in a governor, legislative council, and general assembly. The governor is chosen annually by the council and assembly jointly. The legislative council is composed of one member from each county, chosen annually by the people ; they must be worth \u00a31,000 in real and personal estate within the county, and have been freeholders and inhabitants of the counties they represent for one year. The general assembly is composed of three members from each county, chosen as above : each of them must be worth \u00a3500 in real and personal estate within the county, and have been freeholders and inhabitants for a year. All these, on taking their seats in the legislature must swear, \" that they will not assent to any law, vote, or proceeding, which shall appear to them injurious to the public welfare ofthe state, or that shall annul or repeal lhat part ofthe constitution which establishes annual elections, nor that part respecting trial by jury, nor that part which secures liberty of conscience.\" None of the judges, sheriffs, nor any person holding a post of profit under the governor, except justices of the peace, is entitled to a seat in the assembly. All inhabitants of full age, worth \u00a350, who have resided for twelve months in any county before the election, may vote in that county for representatives in both houses of assembly, and for all public officers."], [419, "399 STATE OF NEW JERSEY. History. \u2014 The first settlers of New Jersey were a num ber of Dutch emigrants from New York, who came over be tween the years 1614 and 1620, and settled iu the county of Bergen. The next settlers were a colony of Swedes and Finns, who, in 1627, fixed themselves upon the river Dela ware. They afterwards purchased ofthe natives the land on both sides that river, (then called New Svvedeland stream ;) and by presents to the Indian chiefs, obtained the terri tory in a peaceable manner. The Dutch and Swedes, though not in perfect harmony with each other, kept possession of the country for many years. In 1683, the Dutch had a house devoted to religious worship at New castle ; the Swedes at the same time had six. The present Swedish churches in Philadelphia, and in Gloucester county, New Jersey, are descendants of these first settlers. Charles II. having, in 1634, granted all the territory, named by the Dutch New Netherlands, to his brother the duke of York ; in June, 1664, the duke granted that part now called New Jersey to lord Berkley and sir George Carteret, jointly ; who, the year following, agreed upon certain concessions with the people for the government of the province, and appointed Philip Carteret, esq. their governor. He purchased considerable tracts of land from the Indians, for trifling considerations, and the settle- ments increased. In 1672, the Dutch conquered the country; but it was restored by the peace of Westminster, two years after wards. In consequence of the conquest made by the Dutch, and to obviate any objections that might be made on account of it against the former grant, a new patent was issued to the duke of York for the same country ; and, in 1674, the province was divided, and West Jersey grant ed by the duke lo the assigns of lord Berkley, and East Jersey to sir George Carteret. In 1675, West Jersey, was sold to John Fenwick, in trust for Edward Bylinge ; and Fenwick went over with a colony, and settled at Salem, near Delaware river, thirty-five miles from Philadelpbia : these were the first English settlers in West Jersey. In 1676, the interest of Bylinge in West Jersey was assigned to William Penn, Gavin Laurie, and Nicholas Lucas, as trustees, for the use of his creditors. Mutual quit claims were executed be tween sir George Carteret and the trustees of Bylinge ; and this partition was confirmed in 1719, by an act of the general assembly of the Jerseys. In 1678, the duke of York made a new grant of West Jersey to the assigns of lord Berkley."], [420, "400 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. Agreeably to sir George Carteret's will, East Jersey was sold, in 1682, to twelve proprietors, who, by twelve sepa- rate deeds, conveyed one half of their interest to twelve other persons, separately, in fee simple : this grant was confirmed to these twenty-four proprietors, by the duke of York, the same year. These shares, by sales of small parts of them, and by these small parts being again divi- ded among the children of successive families, became at last subdivided in such a manner, as that some ofthe pro- prietors had only one 40th part of a 48th part of a 24th share ! West Jersey was in the same condition These inconveniences, aided by other causes of complaint, which had been increasing for several years, and were fast ad- vancing to a dangerous crisis, disposed the proprietors to surrender the government to the crown, which was ac- cordingly done, and accepted by queen Anne, on the 17th of April, 1702. Till this time the government of New Jersey was proprietary ; it now became royal, and so con- tinued till the memorable 4th of July, 1776. This state was the seat of war for several years during the bloody contest between Great Britain and her Ame- rican colonies. Her losses both of lives and property, in proportion to the population and wealth of the state, was greater than that of any other of the thirteen states. When general Washington was retreating through the Jerseys, nearly forsaken by all others, her militia were at all times obedient to his orders ; and, for a considerable length of time composed the strength of his army. There is hardly a town in the state, that lay in the progress of the British army, that was not rendered signal by some great action or enterprise. At Trenton, on the night of Christmas day, 1776, (see page 158) the British received a check which may be said with justice to have turned the tide ofthe war; and at Princeton, the seat of the muses, they received another, which, united, obliged them to retire with precipitation, and to take refuge in winter quarters. Indeed, throughout the revolutionary war, the many gallant atchievements performed by the Jersey soldiers, give this state a very high rank in a military Eoint of view, and entitle her to a share of praise that ears no proportion to her size, in establishing the inde- pendence of the United States. The militia of New Jersey is still a fine body of troops ; and by the returns soc the year 1818, amounted to 35,169 effective men."], [421, "401 STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA. STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA, Situation, Boundaries, and Extent. This fine state is situated between 39\u00b0 43' and 42\u00b0 N. lat, and 2\u00b0 20' E. and 3\u00b0 30' W. long. It is bounded on the north by the state of New York and lake Erie ; on the south, by the states of Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia; east, by New York and New Jersey ; and west, by Ohio and Virginia, Its length, from east to west, is 273, and its breadth, from north to south, 153 miles ; forming an area of 42,500 square miles, or 27,200,000 acres. Rivers.\u2014 This country is remarkably well watered. Lake Erie is situated on the north-west, and Delaware bay on the south-east, by both of which there are fine outlets, the one affording direct and speedy communica* tion with the Atlantic ocean, the other communicating with it by the more circuitous course of the river St, Lawrence ; while it forms a link in the chain of an inland navigation, extending through the lakes upwards of 1,000 miles. To the south-west the state communicates with the river Ohio, having by this means an outlet through the Mississippi to the gulf of Mexieo, and another pas sage from its centre through the Susquehannah river to Chesapeak-bay. There are six considerable rivers, which, with their numerous branches, peninsulate the whole state, viz. the Delaware, Schuylkill, Susquehannah, Yo hogany, Monongahela, aud Allegany. Delaware river, as has been already noticed, rises in the state of New York, and running a south-w-est course, enters Pennsylvania in latitude 42\u00b0; thence flowing south wardly, it divides that state from New York, until it strikes the north-west comer of New Jersey, in lat. 41\u00b0 24'; and thence passes off to the sea through Delaware-bay, In its progress it separates the two latter states upwards of 100 miles to Trenton, where there are falls, but of no great height. From hence it increases in breadth during a course of thirty-six miles to Philadelphia, where it is nearly a mile broad. As it proceeds downwards it gradu ally widens, and at Newcastle, forty miles below Phila delphia, it exceeds two miles in width. It is navigable for a 74-gun ship as far up as Philadelphia; for sloops and other small craft to Trenton-falls, and above them for"], [422, "402 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. boats more than 100 miles. The Delaware is generally frozen one or two months in the year, so as to prevent navigation. The river Schuylkill rises north-west of the Kittatinny mountains (a ridge of the Alleganies) through which it passes into a sine champaign country, and runs from its source upwards of 120 miles in a south-east direction, and passing through the limits of Philadelphia, falls into the Delaware about six miles below the city. It is navigable from Reading, eighty-five or ninety miles, to its mouth. The canal now forming between this river and the Sus quehannah, will bring by water to Philadelphia the trade of a most fertile country of about 1,000 square miles, or 6,000,000 acres of land ! When this is completed, an inland navigation may be easily made to the Ohio and to lake Erie, which would at once open a water communi cation with above 2,000 miles extent of western country, viz. with all the great lakes, and with the immense and fertile regions which lie on the waters of the Mississippi, Missouri, and all their branches. The canal between Schuylkill and Susquehannah, which is the main-spring of all these improvements, will be about sixty miles, as the navigation must go, though the distance on a line is only forty miles. The Susquehannah is a very fine river, and rises in lake Otsego, in the state of New York. Passing into Pennsyl vania, it makes a remarkable bend, called the \" Big Bend ;\" it afterwards stretches into the state of New York about forty miles, from thence back into Pennsylvania, running such a winding course as to cross the boundary line of these states three times. After forming a junction with Tiojja river at the town of Athens, 150 miles north west of Philadelphia, it runs a south-east course about seventy miles, when making a sudden bend, at a right angle, it runs southwesterly eighty miles, and unites with its western branch at Sunbury, 132 miles from Philadelphia. Here the river is half a mile wide, and flows through the mountains, nearly a southerly course of forty miles, to where it receives the Juniata river, about fifteen miles above Harrisburgh, and 115 from Philadelphia. From thence it makes a considerable bend to the eastward, and running about ten miles, it emerges from the mountains, and keeps a south-east course about eighty miles, when it falls iuto Chesapeak-bay, by a mouth above a mile in breadth, a little below Havre-de-Grace, nearly thirty-six miles north-east of Baltimore, and sixty-five south-west of Philadelphia. The western branch of the Susque-"], [423, "403 STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA. hannah, is formed by many streams beyond the Allegany mountains ; some of them rising near the head waters of the river St. Lawrence, aud others within a few miles of the waters of the Ohio and Mississippi, and runs a very circuitous course upwards of 200 miles, principally among the mountains, to its junction with the eastern branch at Suubury. The entire length of the Susquehannah, from Chesapeak-bay to the head ofthe eastern branch, to which it is navigable for boats, is upwards of 450 miles ; and the whole river, including its branches, waters a country nearly 200 miles square. It is navigable for sea vessels onty a few miles, and there are many islands^ rocks, aud falls, which obstruct the navigation even for small craft ; but those obstructions are about to be removed, and, by the assistance of canals and locks, it is intended to open the river to the very source of the eastern branch. The quantity of wild fowl that is seen on every part of the Susquehannah is immense. Throughout the United States the wild fowl is excellent and plentiful ; but there is one duck in particular found on this river, and also on Poto mac and James rivers, which surpasses all others : it is called the white or canvass-back duck, and is held in such estimation in America, that it is frequently sent as a pre sent for hundreds of miles. The several branches of Yohogany river rises on the west side of the Allegany mountains, and after running a short distance, unite and form a large and beautiful river. About thirty miles from its mouth, it passes through the Laurel mountain, where it makes a fall of twenty feet in perpendicular height, the river being about eighty yards wide. At this place ils course is to the south-west, but presently winds round to the north-west, and continuing in that direction for about forty miles, loses its name by uniting with the Monongahela, whicb comes from the southwards and contains, perhaps, twice as much water. The whole length of the Yohogany from its source is about 100 miles. On its banks the land is in general uneven, but in the valleys the soil is extremely rich; all the country abounds with coal, which lies almost on the surface of the ground. The Monongahela rises at the foot of the Laurel mountain in Yirginia, and running a winding course of about 120 miles, passes into this state; soon after which if receives she waters of Cheat river, which is 200 yards wide at its mouth. From thence it continues by a serpen tine course, but nearly in a northern direction; about sixty miles, where it fortes a junction with the Yohogany, (its 3f"], [424, "404 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. principal branch,) eighteen miles by water from Pittsburgh, where it joins the Allegany. At its junction with this river it is 400 yards wide, with a slow,' deep, and gentle current. It is navigable by large boats to Brownsville and Morgantown, 100 miles from its mouth ; and for small boats forty miles farther, where it lessens to the breadth of twenty yards. From the navigable waters of the south-easternmost branch of the Monongahela, there is a portage of only ten miles to the south branch of the Potomac river. The Allegany is a very important river, and may at no distant day, form one of the principal links between the counties east and west of the Allegany mountains. It rises in Potter county, Pennsylvania, within a few miles of the head-waters of the Genessee river, and the west ern branch of the Susquehannah. It is here called Oswaya creek, and running nearly a north-west course of about fifty miles, enters the state of New York ; a few miles within which, at the junction of Olean creek, stands the flourishing village of Hamilton, distant from New York 354 miles, and from Pittsburgh, by the turns of the river, about 260 miles, by land 170 miles. Below Hamilton, the river flows some distance west, inclines again north-west, receives several large branches from the . state of New York, then assuming a soutb-west course, again enters Pennsylvania, and at the town of Warren, 324 miles from Philadelphia, and sixty-one from lake Erie, receives from the north-west Chautaughque river, issuing from a lake of the same name, in Genessee county, New York, the head-waters of which rise within nine miles of lake Erie, over which there is a portage on solid ground, capable of being made a good waggon road. After receiving Chautaughque river, the Allegany runs with many windings, but generally south-west, to Frank lin, 136 miles (by water) above Pittsburgh, where it re ceives the waters of French creek. From thence it pur sues a circuitous course, receiving in its way many tribu tary streams, particularly Toby's creek, about twenty miles below Franklin, and, 130 miles further down, Kiski minitas river ; it then flows on to Pittsburgh and forms a junction with the Monongahela, which united constitute the magnificent river Ohio. The Allegany is navigable, with a slight swell, for light boats, to French creek, where it is 200 yards wide, and through French creek to Water ford, at the mouth of Mohawk river, from whence there is a portage of fourteen miles to lake Erie. The other rivers of any note are the Lehigh,, the Tioga,"], [425, "405 STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA. and the Juniata. The first of these rises among the moun tains between Delaware and Susquehannah, and, running a very crooked passage, emerges from the mountains about fifty miles from its source, and from thence runs through a fine country thirty miles, during which it is navigable to Easton, sixty-nine miles north of Phila delphia, where it falls into the Delaware. The Tioga river has its head-waters partly in Pennsylvania and partly in New York, where some of the streams approach within a sew miles of the waters of the St. Lawrence. These all unite in the state of New York, about forty miles from Athens, and run a south-east course to its junction with the Susquehannah, as already mentioned. The Juniata rises on the Allegany mountains, near the head-waters of the Conemaugh, a branch of the Ohio, and passing through the mountains to the eastward, by a very serpen tine course, it falls into the Susquehannah, as before de scribed ; its whole length being about 200 miles. Mountains, face of the country, climate, soil and pro- ductions. \u2014 A considerable part of this state may be called mountainous; particularly the counties of Bedford, Hunt- ingdon, Cumberland, part of Franklin, Dauphin, and part of Bucks and Northampton, through which pass, under various names, the numerous ridges and spurs which col- lectively form the great range of the Allegany mountains. The principal ridges here are the Kittatiny, or Blue moun- tains, which pass north of Nazareth, in Northampton county, and pursue a south-west course across the river Lehigh, through Dauphin county, just above Harrisburgh, about 100 miles from Philadelphia, thence on the west side ofthe Susquehannah, through Cumberland and Frank lin counties. Back of these, and nearly parallel with them, are Peter's, Tuscarora, and Nescopeck mountains, on the east side of the Susquehannah ; and on the west, Shareman's hills, Sideling hills, Ragged, Great Warrior's, Evits, and Wills mountains; then the great Allegany ridge, which, being the largest, gives its name to the whole range: west of this are the Chesnut ridges. Be tween Juniata river and the west branch of the Susque hannah, are Jack's, Tussy's, and Bald Eagle mountains. The vales between all these ridges are generally of a rich, black soil, suited to the various kinds of grain and grass : some of the mountains will admit of cultivation almost to their tops. To the north and west of the Alleganies ike country is generally level, or agreeably variegited"], [426, "406 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. with hills, valleys, and rich scenery; which continue about 120 miles to the extremity ofthe state. The climate is very various. On the east side of the Allegany mountains it differs nothing from that of Con necticut, already described. It is, in common with the other countries east ofthe mountains, subject to great and sudden changes ; but on the west side it is much more agreeable and temperate, wish a greater portion of cloudy weather, and the winters milder and more humid than on the Atlantic. The winter season commences about the 20th of December, and the spring sets in about two weeks earlier than at New York. There is frost almost every month in the year in some places, and the extremes of heat and cold are considerable. The keenness of the north-west wind in winter is excessive, and surpasses every thing of the kind which the people have any idea of in England. Nevertheless, the state is upon the whole ex-. tremely healthy, and numerous instances of longevity occur; though more rare among the Germans than any other class of the inhabitants, occasioned by their excess of labour and low diet. The soil of Pennsylvania is of many various kinds. To the east of the mountains it is generally good, and a con siderable part of it is bedded on limestone. Among the mountains, the land is rough, and much of it poor, in some parts quite barren ; but there are a great many rich and fertile valleys. In the neighbourhood of York and Lan caster, the soil consists of rich, brown, loamy earth ; and proceeding in a south-westerly course, parallel to the Blue mountains, the same kind of soil is met with as far as Fredericktown, in Maryland. Taken altogether, a great proportion of this state is good land, and no incon siderable part very good. Perhaps the quantity of first rate land is not greater in any of the thirteen original states. The richest part of this state that is settled is the county of Lancaster, and the valley through Cumberland, York, and Franklin counties. The richest that is unsettled, is between Allegany river and lake Erie, and in the coun try on the heads of the eastern branches of the Allegany ; particularly the districts lying contiguous to French creek. In this part of the country both the soil and climate are favourable to cultivation ; the winter not continuing severe longer than three months, nor commencing before the 15th of December. The woods for seventy or 100 miles consist of oak, chesnut, and pine, and are so open, that a man on horseback sees all around him sor half a mile, and often much more : a waggon may go almost any where,"], [427, "407 STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA. without cutting down standing timber. Wheat harvest ends in July, except it be some very late sown pieces; and it is very common for people to sow it in the begin ning of December. There are no marshes or stagnant waters, and the country is elevated and healthful. The produce of this state, by culture, consists of wheat, which is the principal grain, of very general cultivation; rye, Indian corn, buck wheat, oats, barley, in great abund ance, hemp, flax, and vegetables of all the different kinds common to the climate. The various sorts of fruit are produced in vast quantities ; apples and peaches are pecu liarly excellent, and some progress has been lately made jn cultivating the vine, from which good wine has been made. Pennsylvania is a fine grazing country, and great numbers of eattle are fed, and large dairies kept ; but their beef, pork, and cheese, are said to be inferior to Connecticut and the other eastern states : their butter is superior. The mountainous district is pretty much applied to raising of stock ; and the breed of horses is snpposed to be superior to any in the Union. They form a medium between the English saddle and heavy cart horses, and are well adapted for most purposes. Sheep have of late years greatly increased, and thrive remarkably well. The natural growth of this state includes the greater part of the kinds of trees, shrubs, and plants that grow within the United States. Oaks, of several species, form the bulk of the woods ; but hickory, walnut, and sugar maple are very plentiful. Great bodies of the latter tree are to be found in different districts, particularly in the counties of Northampton, Luzerne, Northumberland, and Washington, which afford a well-tasted and wholesome sugar, to considerable advantage : they grow from fifty to sixty feet high, and yield abundance of sap. Cumberland and Franklin valley is timbered principally with locust, black walnut, hickory, and white oak : the mountainous parts are covered with pines, chesnuts, &c. Sassafras, mulberry, tulip tree, and cedar, are common and grow to perfection. It would be endless to describe the beautiful flowering shrubs, and useful as well as ornamental plants which grow in profusion throughout this state. The principal mineral production is iron ore, which abounds in many parts of the state. Bar iron sells for about \u00a327 sterling per ton. Copper, lead, and alum ap pear in some places, but not to any great amount ; though there is a copper and zinc mine now worked about twenty miles from Philadelphia. Limestone is very common, as also marble of several sorts ; particularly a coarse gray"], [428, "408 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. kind, used for chimney-pieces, steps, &c. which sells for one dollar the cubic foot. In the middle and western dis tricts coal is plentiful ; at the head of the western branch of the Susquehannah is a very extensive bed, which stretches over the country as far as Pittsburgh, where it is found in the greatest abundance. There are also consider able bodies of this mineral on the head-waters of the Schuylkill and Lehigh ; and at Wyoming, about 120 miles north-west of Philadelphia, there is a mine of the open burning kind, which gives an intense heat. Most part of the coal hitherto discovered has been accidentally found on the surface of the earth, or in the digging of common cellars; so that when wood fuel becomes scarce and dear, which is already the case in some places, and the proper methods of boring shall be adopted, there can be no doubt of coal being found in many other places. Of the wild animals in the districts newly settled, or now settling, the most useful are deer, in great numbers, beavers, otters, racoons, and martens. Buffaloes seldom pass to the eastward of the Ohio, and elks rarely advance from the north. Panthers, wild cats, bears, foxes, and wolves, are not scarce, in some places too plentiful ; the last do most mischief, particularly in the winter ; but the fur and skins of them all are valuable. In the thick settlements, rabbits and squirrels are numerous, also mink? and musk-rats in marshes ; partridges are plentiful, as are wild turkeys in the western eounties ; pheasants and grouse are scarce ; pigeons, ducks, and wild geese are sound in plenty in their proper seasons. Here are a great variety of singing birds ; as many migrate into this state from the north and south, at certain times of the year. Trouts are very common in the rivulets, in length sel dom above a foot. In the rivers in the eastern parts of the state, the principal fish are rock and sheep's head, with shad and herring ; which, in the spring come up from the sea in great shoals. Civil divisions, towns, population, religion, character, &c. \u2014 Pennsylvania is divided into fifty oeunties, which are subdivided into 651 townships, containing, by the last general census, 810,091 inhabitants ; but by the state enumeration of 1817, the population amounted to 986,494; being about twenty-three persons to each square mile.

It was sounded in 1683 by the celebrated William Penn, and first settled by a colony from England ; which increased so rapidly, that in less than a century the city and suburbs were computed to contain 6,000 houses, and 40,000 inha bitants. It is laid out on a very elegant plan, with streets crossing each other at right angles, andextends between the two rivers, being upwards of two miles in length from east lowest, and little more than one mile in breadth. There are large suburbs to the north and south, on the Delaware river, called the Northern Liberties, Kingston; and Southwark ; and these extend upwards of a mile to the north, and half a mile to the south of the city, making the extreme length on the Delaware nearly three miles; but to the westward the city is closely built only about a mile, the building on the remaining part, towards thi Schuylkill, being thinly scaftered : it is, however, rapidly filling up in that direction. High, or -Market-street, is 100 feet wide, and running the whole length of the city, is terminated by Schuylkill bridge, a very elegant struc ture of three arches, built- of wood, supported by strong stone piers, and covered in on the top. The length of the bridge is 550 feet, besides the abutments and wing walls, which are 750 more. The span of the middle arch is 198 feet, and that of the other two 150 each. It is forty-two feet wide ; the carriage-way, which is divided into two parts, being thirty-two feet, and the foot-way on each side five feet each. This fine bridge, which was six years in building, was lately finished, at the expense of 235,000 dollars. A street, 113 feet wide, called Broad street, crosses Market-street in the middle, where there is \u2022 Laid out since last census."], [431, "411 STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA. a large area named the Centre-square, on which the water works are built. The streets running parallel to High-street, take their names after various trees, said to have been found on the ground on which they are laid out. To the north are Mulberry, Sassafras, and Vine ; to the south, Chesnut, Walnut, Locust, Spruce, Pine, and Cedar-streets. The cross streets are numbered according to situation from the rivers; thus, Front, Second, Third, and so on to Thirteenth-street on the Delaware side ; and from Front to Eighth-street on the Schuylkill side : Mulberry-street is sixty feet wide, and all the rest are fifty. Many of the streets are planted on each side with Italian poplars of a most beautiful growth, which have an appearance truly elegant and rural ; and the effect is greatly increased by a handsome and cleanly pavement of red brick before the houses, for foot passengers, which is regularly washed every morning. Pumps erected on both sides, about fifty yards distant from each other, afford an abundant supply of water ; upon the top of each is a brilliant lamp. It was the intention of the benevolent projector of Philadelphia, that Front-street on the Delaware should have been the eastern boundary, and the space between that and the river converted into public ground, useful and ornamental to the city ; but this elegant plan has been forced to give way to commercial avarice and the greedi- ness for gain, (as in most of the maritime towns in Eng- land,) and this spot is now thickly built up with wharfs, warehouses, &e. forming Water-street, which is no more than thirty feet wide, and is the only crooked and dirty street in the \"ity. It was here that the malignant yellow fever broke out in the year 1793, which made such terri- ble ravages ; and, until very lately, in the summer season, this street has been found to be extremely unhealthy. In the original plan also there were a great number of public squares ; but several of them have been infringed upon, for the causes already given ; though there are still many less, which are very ornamental to the city. The houses are almost wholly built of brick, covered with slate or shingles ; and they are generally ornamented with marble steps, and with soles and lintels for the doors and windows, which form an elegant contrast with the brick, and add much to the beauty of the buildings. Some of the public edifices are entirely composed of marble, and others much ornamented with it, which gives this fine city a magni ficent appearance. The public buildings are so very numerous, that the no. xviii. 3 0."], [432, "412 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. bare mention of a few of them will be sufficient lo con vey an idea of the importance of this city : \u2014 The state house, with the court-houses and philosophical hall ad joining, the dispensary, alms-house, hospital, jail, carpen ter's-hall, college, academy, library, two theatres, and fonr banks. The quakers, baptists, episcopalians, and Roman catholics, have each four houses for public worship ; the German Lutherans six, presbyterians five, methodists three, black methodists two, and the Swedisb Lutherans, Moravians, covenanters, universalists, Unitarians, inde pendents, Jews, aud black episcopalians, one each ; in all, forty ; being six less than in the city of New York. The state-house, in Chesnut-street, is remarkable as being the place from whence the independence of the United States was first proclaimed ; and, previous to the year 1800, when Philadelphia was the seat of the general government, the legislature of the Union held their meet ings in the adjoining buildings. While the legislature of Pennsylvania continued in this city, they assembled in the state-house ; but Lancaster having been appointed the seat of government, that building now contains Peale's museum, a very extensive collection of natural and other curiosities. There are three market-houses in the city, the principal of which is in High-street, and is perhaps exceeded by none in the world, in the abundance, neatness, and variety of provisions, which are exposed for sale every Wednes day and Saturday. The market-hours are from day-light to two o'clock from the lst of April to the lst of Septem ber, and from day-light to three o'clock the remainder of the year. The prices of different articles in English money may be taken as under: flour, 45s. per barrel of 1961b.; beef (best quality) and veal, bd. per lb. ; mut ton, A\\d. ; pork, bd. to Id. ; bacon, Sd. ; fowls, Is. bd. te 2s. 2d. each ; ducks, 1*.

Mechanics board and lodging the same as in that city, with superior accommodations ; but many of them board and lodge with their employers. Labourers are"], [433, "413 STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA. paid 4s. 6d. to 5s. \"l^d. a day ; female servants, 4s. 6d. to 9s. a week, with their board ; men servants, 54s. to 67s. 6d. per month ; house carpenters earn 31s. 6d. to 40s. 6d. per week, working hours from sun-rise to sun-set ; cabinet makers, 36s. to 40s. 6rf.,- .vorking generally by the piece; bricklayers, 31*. 6rf. to 45s. ; tinmen, 27s. to 45s. ; shoe makers, 31s. 6d. to 40s. 6d. ; saddlers, 31s. 6d. to 45s.; coachmakers, the same; tailors, 31s. 6d. to 40s. 6d. ; printers, (compositors and pressmen,) 31s. 6<_ to 40s. 6d. ; employment uncertain, the greater part of the work being done by apprentices. The printing business, though ren dered nugatory to the workmen by the cupidity and avarice of their employers, is yet better established here than in any other place in the United States ; and gives employment to a great number of paper-mills, and all classes connected with the book trade: printers, type founders, engravers, bookbinders, booksellers, &c. Wearing apparel does not differ materially from the New York prices, stated in page 371. A superfine cloth coat costs \u00a38 2s.; a surtout ditto, \u00a311 4s. ; trowsers, 45s. to 54s. ; waistcoats, 26s. ; but clothes of an inferior quality may be had from one-fourth to one-half lower. Shoes are from 13s. 6d. to lbs. 9d. a pair; Wellington boots, 38s. to 45s. ; Hessian ditto, from 42s. 6d. to Abs. ; jockey ditto. 67s. 6d. ; ladies' shoes, 4s. 6d. to 5s. Id. ; the best beaver hats are 40s. 6d. India and French silks, China crapes for ladies' dresses, and India handkerchiefs are one half cheaper than in England. Other articles of wearing apparel, and almost every thing used in domestic economy are imported from Great Britain, The manufactures of Philadelphia are rising into great importance ; the principal of which are, leather of every description, a great variety of wood and iron work, parti cularly bar iron and steel in large quantities, fermented and distilled liquors, earthenware, tinplate, hats, hosiery, a vast variety of cloths, ropes, and ships to a large extent. The frame of a 74-gun ship has been put up in the spring of 1819, and the frames of another line of battle ship and a frigate are collecting in the same place, where there are considerable deposits of timber, copper, iron, and other naval stores. This city is under great obligations to the friends, or quakers, who have given a happy bent to the manners of the people, different from what is to be found in most other places of equal extent. The citizens are industri ous and sober, and though sufficiently commercial, they do not conduct their business in the same ostentatious"], [434, "414 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. style fhat is done by the merchants'of some other cities; but confine themselves within reasonable bounds, and endeavour to secure what they gain. Education is on an excellent footing; besides the larger seminaries already noticed, there are numerous academies and schools throughout the city : the arts and sciences have been long cultivated. A philosophical society was established in 1769, and they have published several volumes of their transactions. The Philadelphia library was commenced as early as 1731, by Dr. Franklin ; in 1742, it was incor porated, since which time the collection of books has been greatly augmented. This excellent institution, which consists of many thousand volumes, besides a valuable philosophical apparatus, and a museum, is open to all strangers who have a taste for reading. The library is furnished with tables and seats ; and a stranger, without any introduction, may call for any book he pleases, and sit down and peruse it as long as he thinks proper. The other societies of greatest importance are, the college of physicians, instituted for the purpose of promoting medi cal, anatomical, and chemical knowledge; the Pennsyl vanian society for promoting the abolition of slavery, and the relief of free negroes unlawfully held in bondage; the academy of fine arts ; the agricultural society ; pre mium society : society for alleviating the misery ofpublic prisons ; humane society ; marine benevolent society ; St. Andrew's society ; Scots thistle society ; St. Patrick's society ; Hibernian society ; St. George's society ; Welsh society ; French benevolent society ; the Philadelphia society for the information and assistance of emigrants, and two other societies of the same kind, one for the relief of German, and another for the relief of Irish emigrants ; and various other charitable societies. The grand lodge of Pennsylvania is established here, and there are fifteen or sixteen subordinate lodges of free-masons. The police of this city is said to be better regulated than that of auy other in the United States ; it appears, indeed, to be much better than New York. There are a number of well-paid public scavengers, who clean the streets at regular periods; and, as has been already ob served, the side-pavements are generally washed every morning. The city is elevated fifty or sixty feet above the river, in consequence of which there is an ample descent for the water ; and the streets being well supplied with common sewers, all the filth is completely carried off, and they are kept sweet by the supply of fresh water from the water-works, which is constantly pouring into"], [435, "415 STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA them from every quarter. This water also keeps the streets pure, by running along the gutters ; so that almost every street has a little stream on each side of it ; which, in a large city, must be highly conducive to health and clean liness. The city is supplied with water by contract, and the contractor is obliged to supply three millions of gal lons daily, if required. The annual expense is 6,000 dol lars for 1,000,000 of gallons per day, and for any addi tional quantity up to 2,000,000, the expense is at the rate of half that sum. The engine is forty horse power, and can raise, if necessary, 4,500,000 gallons per day, so that the supply must be abundant for every purpose. The building which contains the reservoir of the water-works stands upon the most elevated ground in the city. It occupies a square of sixty feet, and from the centre arises a circular tower, forty feet in diameter and sixty feet high ; and this tower is terminated by a dome, which gives it a very handsome appearance. The water is con veyed to this building from the Schuylkill, a distance of nearly a mile, through a circular brick tunnel of six feet diameter, having a fall of six inches towards the river. It is first received into a substantial bason and canal, and from thence is raised by a steam engine to the level of the aqueduct, which conveys it to the Centre-square. It is there received into another bason, and thence by an other steam engine is elevated to the circular tower, from whence it issues through wooden pipes, in all directions, to supply' the city. The whole expense of these works was about \u00a333,750 sterling ; the fund for which was raised by the corporation, partly by a tax, and partly by loan, allowing the lenders six per cent, interest for their money, and the use of the water free for three years for every 100 dollars subscribed. The state prison of Pennsylvania, which owes its origin to the enlightened citizens of Philadelphia, deserves particular notice in this place. Its object is to receive the vicious, and, if possible, to reclaim them to virtue; and is an admirable contrast to the cruel punishments of the European governments, who, for even pecuniary offences, send the offenders off to the other world to be reclaimed there. Criminals are not admitted into this place of confinement till after conviction, when they are received from the different parts of the state : it is hence called the state prison. When a convict is received, his name is taken down, or, in other words, he becomes a partner in the concern, and an account is opened with him in the books. Inquiry is then made what he can do :"], [436, "416 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. if he can work at any trade, he is taken to the apartment where that branch is carried on, and has his task assigned him. If he can work at no trade, he is sent to saw marble. As an inducement to industry, the prisoners get credit in the books for tbe value of their labour, and are charged with the amount of their food and clothing; which, however, are not expensive, as every thing is con ducted with great economy: when they are released, should their earnings be more than the expense of their maintenance, the balance is duly paid to them. Almost every trade is carried on in the prison ; and the institution is so organized, that the necessaries of life are attended to by the convicts themselves, such as baking, cooking, scrubbing the rooms, &c. ; and every7 thing is kept remark ably dean. The food is wholesome and nutritive, con sisting of Indian flour, bread, and flesh meat: the drink is treacle and water, no spirituous liquors being admitted within the walls of the prison. There are separate apart ments for the reception of female convicts, where the various parts of female labour are carried on, and it is otherwise under the same system of management as that for the males. This jail is inspected twice every week by twelve per sons, chosen annually from amongst the citizens of Phila delphia ; and these men act voluntarily without any reward whatever. From their report to the general inspectors, an opinion is formed of the conduct of each individual prisoner, and, with the consent of the judges, his treatment is regulated accordingly. This is varied according to his crime, and to his subsequent repentance. Solitary confinement in a dark cell is considered the severest punishment ; next, solitary confinement in a cell with the admission of light; next, confinement in a cell where the prisoner is allowed to work ; lastly, labour in company with others. The longest period of confine ment is for a rape, which is not to be less than ten years, but not to exceed twenty-one. For high treason, the length of confinement is not to be less than six nor more than twelve years. No crime is punishable with death except premeditated murder. Objections may7 be made to the mildness of the punish ments in Pennsylvania, as not being sufficient to atone for a very atrocious offence, and especially as they are not inflicted in public. But on a close examination they will be found to be very severe, and better calculated to prevent crime than any other that could be adopted. If any public punishment could strike terror into the wicked,"], [437, "417 STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA. it is likely that the infliction of death would have that effect ; but we find from experience that this is not the case. A month scarcely passes over iu England without repeated executions ; and there is hardly a vagabond to be met with in the country, who has not seen a fellow creature suspended from the gallows: yet we all know what little good has arisen from such dreadful spectacles. But immured in darkness and solitude, the prisoner suffers pangs worse than death, a hundred times in the day ; and in such a situation the most hardened offender is soon reduced to a state of repentance. Excepting the cells, which are iu a remote part of the building, the prison has the appearance of a large manu factory ; good order and decency prevail throughout, and the eye of the spectator is never assailed by the sight of such ghastly and squalid figures as are continually to be met with in our prisons. Indeed, this jail is under such excellent management, that instead of being an expense, it now produces a considerable revenue to the state. The inhabitants of Philadelphia are composed of Eng lish, Irish, Scotch, Germans, French, and American born citizens, descended from the people of these different nations, who are, of course, by far the most numerous. They are for the greater part engaged in some sort of business ; a few, and a few only, live without any osten sible professions, on the fortunes which they themselves have raised : yet these men are not idle or inattentive to the increase of their property, being ever ready to pro fit by the sale or purchase of lands. Indeed it would be difficult to find a man of any opulence here who is uot concerned in the buying or selling of land, which may be considered in the United States as an article of com merce. Among the various branches of trade carried on in this populous city, that of selling goods by public auction is practised to an amazing extent. In the quarter ending on the 30th of Juue, 1818, the auctioneers of Philadelphia had paid into the state treasury the sum of \u00a36,432 15s. sterling. In a large city like that which we are now describing, where people are assembled together from so many different quarters, there cannot fail to be a great diversify in the manners ofthe inhabitants. But it isa remark very generally made, not only by foreigners, but by natives of America, that the Philadelphians are not so social, nor perhaps so hospitable, as the people of Boston, New York, and Charleston, particularly the latter. Various causes have occasioned this difference ; among others,"], [438, "418 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. party spirit, which for many years was here carried fo great lengths, may have contributed not a little. Yet no place iu the United States can boast of so many useful improvements in manufactures, in the mechanical arts, in the art of healing, and especially in the science of humanity. Philadelphia is governed by a mayor, who has a salary of _\u00a3675 sterling per annum ; a recorder, fifteen aldermen, and thirty common-council men, according to its charter, dated in year 1789. In 1793, this city was visited by a severe scourge, the yellow fever, which raged with un- common violence for three months, and in that short space carried off nearly 5,000 of the inhabitants. The humane efforts of a committee of health, appointed by the citizens, were highly instrumental in diminishing the calamity. A few weeks after this disorder ceased to rage, the trade of the city was restored in a manner incredible to any but eye-witnesses. Philadelphia is distant 139 miles from Washington, 100 from Baltimore, 91 from New York, 323 from Boston, 276 (by York) from Pittsburgh, 686 from Charleston, 511 from Chilicothe, 647 from Lexington, Kentucky, 1,108 from St. Louis, and 1,561 from New Orleans. Exclusive of Philadelphia, this state contains twelve towns in which there are from 1,300 to 10,000 inhabitants : among which, Lancaster, York, Reading, Carlisle, Harris burgh, and Pittsburgh are the most conspicuous. Besides these, there are nearly twenty villages, containing from 200 to 1,000 inhabitants ; and the greater part, if not the whole, of these towns and villages are increasing in wealth and population. Lancaster, the chief town of Lancaster county, is situ ated in a fertile and well-cultivated plain, sixty-two miles from Philadelphia, on the great road ieading to Pitts burgh. It is built on a regular plan, the streets crossing each other at right angles, and is a considerable place both for extent and population. The public buildings are, seven places for public worship, viz. two for German Lutherans, and one each for German Calvinists, presby terians, episcopalians, Moravians, and Roman catholics, a handsome court-house, a market-house, and a jail. The inhabitants are nearly all of German origin, and are a quiet, sober, and industrious set of people ; they in gene ral speak their own language, aud numbers of them are ignorant of any other. Several different kinds of articles are manufactured in this town by German mechanics. individually; who sor the most part are armourers, hat-"], [439, "419 STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA. ters, saddlers, and coopers. The rifle-barrelled guns made here have been long celebrated for their excellence, and are the only arms that are used by the inhabitants of the interior part of the country, and by the Indians. York is situated eighty-four miles from Philadelphia, and twenty-two from Lancaster, on the Pittsburgh road ; the inhabitants are German emigrants or their descend ants, and very few of them speak English. The town is regularly laid out, and contains abont 600 houses, most of which are of brick ; the public buildings are a court house, a stone jail, a record-office, an academy, a German Lutheran, ditto Calvinist, a presbyterian, Roman catholic, and Moravian church, and a quaker meetinghouse. Reading, the capital of Berks county, is a beautiful town, situated on Schuylkill river, fifty-four miles north west of Philadelphia, on the road to lake Erie. It is a flourishing place, regularly laid ont, and inhabited chiefly by Germans ; it contains above 600 houses, a stone jail, a court-house, an elegant church for German Lutherans, another for Calvinists, one for Roman catholics, a meet ing-house for friends, and a large edifice for public offices. In the neighbourhood of this town are a number of fulling mills, and several iron-works. Carlisle, the chief town of Cumberland county, is situ ated upon a pleasant and healthy plain, on the road to Pittsburgh, fifty-one miles from Lancaster, and 113 from Philadelphia. The houses, about 500 in number, are partly of brick and partly of wood, and have a very respectable appearance. The public buildings are, a college, jail, court-house, and five places for worship ; the principal religious denominations are German Lutherans, presby terians, episcopalians, and Roman catholics. In this town are a number of large shops and warehouses, which are supplied from New York and Philadelphia with large quantities of hardware, jewellery, mercery, groceries, &c. The persons who keep these shops purchase and also barter with the country people for the produce of their farms, which they afterwards send off to the sea-port towns for exportation. The college is named Dickenson, in honour of a gentleman of that name, who was its founder, and is esteemed an excellent seminary of learn ing. It possesses a philosophical apparatus and a library of 3,000 volumes, with a fond of 10,000 dollars, to which 10,000 acres of land were added by the state. There are a principal and three professors, and the students amount to above one hundred. Harrisburgh, the chief town of Dauphin county, and 3h"], [440, "420 United states of America. the seat of government for the state of Pennsylvania, is situated on the north-east bank of Susquehannah river, ninety-seven miles from Philadelphia, on the road leading to Carlisle and Pittsburgh. It is handsomely laid out on the elegant plan of Philadelphia, having four streets run ning parallel with the river, named Front, Second, and so on ; and these are crossed by others at right angles, called Mulberry, Chesnut, Market, Walnut, Locust, and Pine. The houses are mostly of brick, have a good appearance, and the town is rapidly increasing since it became the seat of government. There is a handsome court-house, a German church, a stone jail ; and the public edifices sor the accommodation of the state legislature will be the most elegant structures in Pennsylvania. Harrisburgh was first planned in the year 1785, and has been pro gressively improving ever since : from its commanding and central situation, it will, in all probability, become one of the largest inland towns in the United States. Town lots sell for more than 2,000 dollars ; and land in the neigh bourhood from eighty to 100 dollars per acre. Pittsburgh tbe capital of Allegany county, is situated on a beautiful plain at the confluence of the Allegany and Monongahela rivers ; the junction of which form the majestic Ohio. The site of the town is contracted, being hemmed in by hills to the eastward : it extends about three fourths of a mile along the Allegany, and half a mile along the Monongahela ; but there is room for it to extend two miles upon the former river. This interesting town was first planned in 1765 ; but it was surveyed and laid out on a new plan in 1784. The great importance of its situation may be determined by a statement of its progress for the last eighteen years. At the end of the year 1800, it con tained 2,400 inhabitants ; and in 1807 the number of the houses amounted to about 500. In 1810 it contained eleven stone buildings, 283 of brick, and 473 of frame and log; making in all 767; at the same time the population had increased to 4,768. In 1818 there were about 1,500 houses and upwards of 10,000 inhabitants ; having more than doubled its population in eight years ; and there is every probability that this ratio will continue for a con siderable time to come, so that Pittsburgh will in all like lihood become one of the largest towns in the United States. The public buildings are, a court-house, jail, market-house, bank, academy, and five places of public worship : there are ,also several extensive manufactories, which may well rank with public buildings ; among which are a steam flour mill, five glass-houses, several air-"], [441, "421 STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA. furnaces, breweries, and distilleries, two cotton establish- ments, wire-drawing, by steam, white lead works, nail steam factory, &e. <_c. The following enumeration ofthe professions exercised in Pittsburgh, will shew the rapid progress that society has made in this prosperous town : Blacksmiths, eighteen; boot and shoemakers, fourteen; copper smiths and tinplate workers, eleven ; cabinet- makers, hatters, nail-makers, and tanners, seven of each; saddlers, six ; silver-smiths, watchmakers, and glass manu- facturers, five of each ; iron- founders, tallow-chandlers, tobacconists, and waggon-makers, four of each ; brewers, brush-makers, gun-smiths and bridle-bit makers, plane- makers, and Windsor-chair makers, three of each ; cotton- spinners and carders, cutlers, hardware, steam-engine- makers, weavers, and woollen manufacturers, two of each ; auger-maker, bellows-maker, button-maker, currier, lock- smith, linen-manufacturer, paper ditto, pattern-maker, roper, spinning machine maker, Spanish brown maker, silver plater, wire-drawer, and white-lead manufacturer, one of each. Total number of workmen employed, 1,280. Total amount of manufactures, 1,896,396 dollars. All the above branches of trade are flourishing, and many of those employed at them are becoming wealthy ; while the whole are in a state of comfortable independence. Labour, as in every other part of the United States, is well paid ; and especially so, when taking into consideration the prices of provisions, which are as follows: Beef, mutton, and veal, 3d. to Ad. per lb. ; pork, Ad. to bd. ; bacon, Id. to 9d. ; venison, 3d. to bd. ; fowls, 12... each ; ducks, ISd. ; geese, 2s. 2d. to 2s. 9d. ; turkeys, 3s. A\\d. to 5s. ; fish very plenty and cheap ; butter, lOd. to \\Sd. per lb. ; tea, 6s. 9d. to 12s. 6d . ; coffee, 20.?. ; moist sugar, 12d. ; maple ditto, 6d. ; loaf ditto, 18.. to 206?.; flour, 13s. per cwt.; potatoes, 2s. 2d. to 3s. per bushel ; coals, Ad. per ditto ; cheese, 9c?, to 12rf. per lb. ; porter, 6d. per quart ; cider, four dollars per barrel ; whiskey, 2s. 3d. and peach brandy, 3s. 6d. per gallon. Mechanic's board and lodging, 15s. 9d. a week. Good workmen in the following branches are paid the wages here stated : Smiths and tanners, 13s. 6d. a week, besides board and lodging ; ship-wrights, 6s. 9d. per day ; tailors, glass-blowers, tinmen, and hatters, 45s. per week ; house carpenters and bakers, 40s. 6d. ; shoemakers, black smiths, nail-cutters, brewers, and printers, 36s, (two latter, employment almost unattainable) ; glass-cutter, 65s. ; labourers, 27s. : those employed in the coal-works, 36s. ; for weavers, no employment could be found here. Land in the neighbourhood of Pittsburgh js worth 100"], [442, "422 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. dollars per acre ; from five to twenty miles distant, from fifteen to fifty dollars. Wheat sells for a dollar a bushel, and Indian corn for 3-4ths of a dollar A good carthorse is worth thirty dollars, a gig horse, eighty ; a saddle ditto, 120; a farmers waggon, 100 dollars; a market ditto, seventy ; a cart, fifty. Sheep are from one to three dollars each ; live hogs, from 3d. to Ad. per lb. ; a good roasting pig, 4s. 66?. Rents vary much according to situation ; houses in the best stands for business are from 400 to 800 dollars per annum ; others are from 150 to 350 ; house rent for a mechanic, from fifty to eighty dollars. The situation of Pittsburgh is as advantageous as can well be imagined; it is the key to the western country, and, excepting New Orleans, is in every respect the first town, not only of the Ohio valley, but of the whole waters of the Mississippi. It was created a city by the legislature of Pennsylvania, at the session of 1816. The principal cause which has contributed most, after its fine position, to ensure the prosperity of Pittsburgh, is the exhaustless mass of mineral coal that exists in its neigh- bourhood The beds are 340 feet above low water level, and about 290 above the level of the town ; consequently the coal is a falling body, from the moment it issues from the mouth of the mine, until placed in the cellar of the consumer. The great abundance of this valuable material has converted Pittsburgh into a vast workshop, and a warehouse for the immense country below, upon the Ohio and many other rivers. It is a fact which has been obtain- ed from the merchants on the spot, that in the space of seven months, in the year 1815, merchandise passed through this infant city to the full amount of twenty mil- lions of dollars ! It may not be irrevelant here to notice, that the first steam-boat that ever floated on the western waters was the New Orleans, launched at Pittsburgh, in March, 181 1 ; the number now on the confluent waters of the Mississippi amounts to upwards of twenty, and they are annually increasing. As the river Ohio will be described with the states through which it passes, it will only be necessary in this place to notice, that from Pittsburgh, where it is 980 yards in breadth, it flows within the state of Pennsylvania to Georgetown, thirty-two miles distant ; from thence it forms the boundary between the states of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, and those of Virginia and Kentucky, until it falls into the Mississippi, 945 miles below Pittsburgh, and 990 above New Orleans. At the distance of 252 miles from Pittsburgh, it is 500 yards wide ; at Louisville, 300"], [443, "423 STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA. miles further, it is 1,200 yards, and at the Rapids, half a mile ; but its general breadth does not exceed 600 yards. In some places its width is not 400, and in one place parti cularly, far below the Rapids, it is less than 300. Its breadth in no one place, (except at the Rapids,) exceeds 1,200 yards ; and at its junction with the Mississippi, neither river is more than 900 yards wide. The banks of the Ohio are high and solid, and persons may travel all night, even in one of the barges, without the smallest danger; instead of which, ou the Mississippi, before the adoption of steam-boats, prudence required passengers to stop every evening, particularly from the mouth of the Ohio to Natchez, a distance of 686 miles. The inhabitants of Pittsburgh being a collection from all nations, kindreds, and languages, it must naturally be supposed that they will exhibit a considerable variety of manners. They are principally Americans ; a good many Irish, some English, Scotch, French, Dutch, and Swiss, and a few Welsh and Italians. But as they are mostly mechanics, having no separate interest to keep them at variance, they are generally friendly and sociable with one another ; and will at no distant day lose all their distinc tions in the general name of Americans. This event will be facilitated by an act which has passed the state legis lature, for the erection of two bridges over the Monon gahela and Allegany rivers, in places best calculated to promote intercourse with the adjacent country, and to unite together the scattered and detached fragments of the same commercial community. Pittsburgh has been very justly considered as a common centre to a great part of the western country ; but it is much more, \u2014 from the very extensive mercantile connections of this city, the traveller or emigrant can receive more accurate intelli gence here than in any other place west of the Allegany mountains, upon almost every subject of inquiry. The situation of religion and religious rights and liberty in Pennsylvania, is a matter that deserves the attention of all sober and well-disposed people, who may have any thoughts of seeking the enjoyment of civil and religious liberty in America. This state always afforded an asylum to the persecuted sects of Europe; and no church has ever been established here, nor can tithes or tenths be demanded. The half-way doctrine of toleration has been entirely rejected, and all denomiuations of religious men are placed upon firm aud perfectly equal ground. By the provisions ofthe law, a protestant, a Roman catholic, and a Jew, may elect or be elected to any office in the;"], [444, "424 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. state, and pursue any lawful calling, occupation, or pro fession. The people throughout this state are for the most part descendants of English, Irish, and Germans, with some Scotch, Welsh, Swedes, and a few Dutch. There are also many of the Irish and Germans who emigrated when young or middle aged. The quakers and episcopalians are chiefly of English extraction, and compose about one third of the inhabitants. They live principally in Phila delphia, and in the counties of Chester, Bucks, and Mont gomery. Some of the Irish are Roman catholics ; but they are mostly presbyterians, whose ancestors came from the north of Ireland, where the people are nearly all of that religious denomination. They iuhabit the western and frontier counties, and are numerous. The Germans compose about one quarter of the population, and chiefly reside in the counties of Philadelphia, Montgomery, Bucks, Dauphin, Lancaster, York, and Northampton. They consist of Lutherans, Calvinists, Moravians, Roman catholics, Mennonists, Tunkers, and quakers: these are all distinguished for their temperance, industry, and economy. The baptists, who are not Germans, are de scended of emigrants from Wales ; but they are not nume rous. A proportionate assemblage of the national pre judices, the manners, customs, religious, and political sentiments of all these, will form the character of the Pennsylvanians. From the preceding observations the state of society may be inferred with tolerable precision. The inhabitants have every external appearance of ease and affluence, and they are affable, obliging, and hospita ble. There are no beggars to be seen, nor any person bearing the semblance of want ; which is a remarkable and happy contrast to the wretched state of Europe, and bears undeniable testimony to the prosperity of the country. Trade, manufactures, and agriculture. \u2014 The exports of this state consist chiefly of grain, flour, iron utensils, cordage, bark, skins, hosiery, gunpowder, ashes, cider, flaxseed, soap and candles, lumber, beef, pork, &c. and in the year 1817 amounted to 8,735,592 dollars, of which 5,538,003 dollars were domestic produce The principal articles of export to Britain are grain and flour, and some cotton, brought from the southern states ; much of the trade with which arises from the superiority of Pennsyl vania in manufactures and commerce. Hats, saddlery."], [445, "425 STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA. shoes, Windsor chairs, carriages, hewn stones, iron cast ings, spades, hoes, axes, paper, books, tin ware, and brushes, constitute a great proportion of the exports to the southward. The trade with New York depends chiefly on the fluctuation of the market: American and foreign goods, of the same kinds, are carried between the two great commercial cities as their prices fall and rise. The commerce of Pennsylvania in the west, is by the river Ohio with the immense and fertile regions on the Mississippi, and by the lakes with the British provinces. Nearly the whole foreign trade of the state is carried on by the port of Philadelphia. The imports consist of East and West India and China goods ; wine, brandy, gin, &c. from the continent of Europe; and manufactures from Great Britain, of which the quantity imported is immense. Whale oil and bone, spermaceti, seal-skins, mackarel, cod-fish, and salmon, are brought from the eastern states, in exchange for wheat flour and bar iron. Live oak, cedar, cotton, rice, indigo, tar, pitch, and lumber, are procured from the Carolinas and Georgia ; and from the back country, great quanti ties of deer-skins, with those of otters, racoons, foxes, musk-rats, and beavers. Virginia furnishes a great deal of wheat, and tobacco, also coal, lead, and peach brandy; and in return receives clothing, furniture, farming utensils, and equipage; with some East India and European goods, and even West India produce. New Jersey and Dela ware states have, as neighbours, much intercourse with Pennsylvania: the first supports in a great measure the markets of Philadelphia, furnishes rye meal, much Indian corn, lumber, and some iron goods ; the latter sends great quantities of excellent flour, lumber, and fat cattle. Manufacturing is carried on to a greater extent in Pennsylvania than in any other state of the Union. Do mestic manufactures are general throughout the country; but there are many establishments on a large scale, some of which are here enumerated. Of iron, there are several works of long standing, and their products increase in quantity and improve in quality. Not less than fifty fur naces, besides numerous forges, slitling-mills, and trip hammers are now in active operation. Of wood, all sorts of furniture, implements of husbandry, pleasure carriages, machinery for carding and spinning cotton, woollen, &c. and ship-building to a considerable extent. Of leather, boots, shoes, saddles, bridles, harness, &c. Of wool, a great variety of cloths, stockings, and hats ; and much wool is worked up in families for domestic use. Together"], [446, "426 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. with many other articles in large quantity, such as malt liquors, spirits, glass, ashes, maple sugar, muskets, powder, paper to a great amount, shot, balls, cannon, bells, earthen ware, copper lead, tin wares, gunpowder, tobacco, mo lasses, &c. The agriculture of this state has improved rapidly, and is in an advanced state; the country about Philadelphia in particular is well cultivated, and abounds with neat country houses. Farms within a few miles of the city, on the road leading to Pittsburgh are managed in a very superior manner ; they consist of from fifty to 200 acres, and are worth i.45 sterling an acre. The farmers are chiefly Dutch and Germans, and their descendants, who are a quiet, sober, and industrious set of people, and are most valuable citizens. They are almost all wealthy, and have fine dwellings, substantial barns, and an excellent breed of cattle. There are good farms in other dis tricts within twenty miles of Philadelphia, which can be purchased from eighty to 100 dollars an acre, buildings included ; limestone land sells for 200 dollars. In a farm of 200 acres, the proportion may be estimated at ninety acres of ploughing, fifty of meadow, ten of orchard, and fifty of wood land : the latter, near the city, is worth from three to 400 dollars an acre, the country being almost totally stripped of the trees, which have been cut down without mercy for firing, and to make way- for the plough. A farm of the above description is worth, if within five miles of the capital, 20,000 dollars ; at from twenty to forty miles, 10,000 dollars. Uncleared lands, in remote parts of the state, vary in price from half a dollar to twenty dollars an acre. The couutry near the eastern branches of the Allegany river has been already mentioned (page 406) as particu larly adapted to cultivation, and highly capable of im provement, ln Venango county, on French creek, are many inducements to encourage new settlers. Much of the land is still on sale, and at a low price, the necessaries of life uncommonly cheap, and game so plentiful, that one tolerable marksman may supply the largest family with fresh provisions. A hunter rarely fails to kill from five to ten deer in a week, and the quarters may be pur chased at three dollars a cwt. : the meat is very fine, and much better covered than the generality of mutton. Wheat flour is plenty and good, at three dollars ter 1201b. ; beef, in the quarter, four dollars a cwt. ; butter, thirteen dollars ditto ; maple sugar the same ; Indian corn meal, 3s. Ad. sterling a bushel. In the summer of 1818 mechanics were"], [447, "427 STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA. very scarce, and greatly wanted ; many hundreds could then have had employment at Franklin* and the adjacent country. Masons, carpenters, and joiners, are paid two dollars a day, or 21 bushels of wheat, 4^ of Indian corn. The hire of a labouring man on a farm, is from 120 to 150 dollars a year, with board and lodging. Tools for tradesmen very high, and often not to be had at any price. Well-improved lauds in this state will produce, on an average, twenty-five bushels of wheat an acre, (within a few miles of Philadelphia forty have been raised ;) of Indian corn from thirty to fifty bushels. The price of wheat, iu 1818, was from 7s. 6d. to 9s. Sd. sterling a bushel; Indian corn, 3s. Id. to 4s. A\\d. ; oats, Is. 9d. to 2s. &d. Horses are worth from \u00a311 to \u00a333; a good milch cow will cost about \u00a35 15s. ; sheep (which are much smaller than the English) are sold from Ils. to 21s. 6d. ; rams, \u00a34 to \u00a311 ; pigs a month old, 2s. 3d.; a sow and pig, \u00a31 Ils. to \u00a32 14s. ; a hog of 1001b. weight, \u00a31 Ils. 6d. to \u00a32 5s. ; a yoke of oxen, \u00a316 to \u00a328. A farm waggon will cost from \u00a322 to \u00a327 ; a farm cart, fifty dollars ; a gig, from 300 to 450 dollars. The farmers throughout Pennsylvania are generally in a state of affluence ; the farms, with a few exceptions only, being the property of the persons who cultivate them. The northern parts of the state are still thinly inhabited ; but towards the south, the whole way from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh, it is well settled. The most populous part of it is the south-east corner, which lies between the mountains and the river Delaware ; and through which the turnpike road passes which leads to Lancaster. The country on each side the road is pleasingly diversified with hill and dale; but cultivation is chiefly confined to the low lands, which are the richest, and the hills are gene- rally left covered with wood, affording a pleasing variety to the eye. The further you go from Philadelphia the more fertile is the country, and the scenery the more beautiful. In the cultivated parts of the state, it is rare to find a farm exceeding 300 acres ; towards the north, however, where the settlements are not so numerous, large tracts of land are in the hands of individuals, who are speculators and land-jobbers. Adjoining to the farm houses there is mostly a peach or apple orchard ; with the fruit they make cider and brandy, and have also a method of drying the peaches and apples in the sun, and thus cured they last all the year round. Many ofthe farmers who are * Franklin, the chief town of A .nango county, is 479 miles distant from New York, and 136 frem Pittsburgh. 3i"], [448, "428 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. remote from a market, distil their grain, finding whisky to be the most convenient and profitable form under which to carry and dispose of their stock. It has been observed in another part of this Work that the German, Dutch, and Swiss emigrants succeed much better in the United States than those from any other country. This is not so much owing to greater industry or economy, as to the more judicious mode they adopt in settliug. In general, before these people emigrate they form associations, lay down plans, and send an agent over in whom they can confide. He purchases for them a suit able extent of land, and prepares the way : when their arrangements are made, they move over in one body. The consequences of this prudent system is no where more visible than in Pennsylvania, in all parts of which, they are in possession of the best lands. With a view to the instruction of emigrants from this country, and for the sake of example, the progress of one of these societies shall be described. This is the Harmonist society, which originated in the duchy of Wurtemburgh, and in the year 1803,sent George Rapp and others, as deputies, who fixed npon a situation in Butler county, in this state, about twenty miles from Pittsburgh, where they purchased 9,000 acres of land. The year following the whole society, \u2022amounting to 160 families, embarked at Amsterdam in three ships, and arrived safe in America. In November, a part of the society removed to their place of destination, and built nine log-houses; in the spring of 1805, they were joined by the remainder, the whole of their property amounting to 20,000 dollars. In February, a constitution was formed, whose principles were the same as the first apostolic church, (see Acts iv. 32.) \" And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart, and of one soul : neither said any of them that aught of the things which he possessed was his own ; but they had all things com- mon.\" There is no such thing as individual property, every thing belongs to the seciety, all labour is in com- mon. All the produce and provisions, are deposited in a large brick store, and served out according to the wants of the different members. During the winter of 1805, they erected eighteen log-houses, eighteen feet by twenty- four, and a large barn. Ground to the amount of 150 acres was cleared for corn, forty for potatoes, and fifteen for meadow. A grist and saw mill were erected, and a race way dug three-fourths of a mile long. Thirty addi- tional houses were built in tbe autumn of the same year. In 1806, 300 acres of land were cleared for corn, fifty-"], [449, "429 STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA. eight for meadow ; a public inn, several dwelling-houses, a framed barn, 100 feet long, aud an oil mill were erected. The next year, among other improvements, 400 acres were cleared ; a brick store-house, saw mill and beer brewery were built. Every succeeding year has added to their wealth and buildings. They have now several capa cious brick and framed barns, a brick meeting-house, ware house, fulling, dyeing, grist and hemp mills, carding ma chines, spinning jennies, distilleries, &c. The annual quantity of produce, consisting of wheat, rye, oats, barley, and potatoes, exceeds 40,000 bushels, besides 5,000 lbs. of flax and hemp, 100 gallons of sweet oil, distilled from the white poppy, and the product of twelve acres of vineyard. This truly economical people appropriate every foot of the earth within the limits of their little republic, to some object of utility. Hills, which are too steep for the plough or the harrow, are planted wish the vine. Their vineyard is situated on the south side of a steep hill, and exhibits to the eye a succession of benches, rising one above the other, like the galleries of churches, the front of each bench or flat being walled up with stones, to prevent the sliding or caving of the earth. They have about 3,000 acres of ground cleared ; have a large stock of cattle, and about 1,000 sheep ; part of which are merino. Their cloth has obtained a high reputation. There are about 100 mechanics, who work for the country as well as the society. The number of common labourers amounts to about 700 men, who will readily dispose of a large job of work, a field of 100 acres is scarcely the labour of a day. Nothing can exceed their industry. Idleness and intem perance are unknown among them. Food, clothing, and physic, are all received from the public stores. Their costume is very* plain ; the women dress with no motive of conquest. All are uniform ; a linsey or woollen jacket and petticoat, a close black cap, with a patch of cotton or wool on the crown, and tied under the chin, are their constant attire. The whole society attends divine wor ship on Sunday. The venerable Rapp fills the pulpit. Every thing, in short, proceeds witb the regularity of clock-work. Their village is called Harmony, after the society. It is situated on the right bank of the Connoquenesing creek, which heads near the Allegany river, and runs into the Big Beaver, about fifty miles above its entrance into the Ohio. Over this creek they have a bridge 220 feet long. The creek affords many facilities sor water machinery. The surrounding country is excellent for pasturage, but"], [450, "430 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. not of the first quality for grain. This interesting little colony have principally removed to the banks of the Wabash, below Vincennes, where they have commenced the culture of the vine, and the manufacture of broad clotbs from merino wool. Constitution. \u2014 The civil government of Pennsylvania is vested in a legislature, consisting ofa senate and house of representatives. The senators are chosen for four years, and the representatives annually, by the people. The exe cutive authority is vested in a governor, who is also chosen by the people, and holds his office for three years. The constitution declares, \" That all men are born equally free and independent ; that all power is inherent in the people ; that all men have a natural and indisputable right to worship God according to the dictates of their own consciences, and no man can be compelled to attend, erect, or support any place of worship, or to maintain any minis try against his consent ; that no human authority can, in any case whatever, controul or interfere with the rights of conscience, and that no preference shall ever be given, by law, to any religious establishments or modes of wor ship ; that elections shall be free and equal ; that trial by jury shall be inviolate ; that no law shall ever be made to restrain the liberty of the press ; that the people shall be secure against all unwarrantble searches, and excessive bail shall not be required ; that the legislature shall pro vide by law for the establishment of schools throughout the state, in such a manner as the poor may be taught gratis; and that the arts and sciences shall be promoted.\"\u2014 The qualifications required to render a person eligible to sit in the legislature, is two years residence in the city or county for which he is chosen ; no member can hold any other office, except in the militia, the colonels of which are chosen by the freemen.* The qualifications of the electors are, full age, having resided in the state two years next before the election, and paid a state or county tax ; the sons of freemen, being twenty-one years of age, are also entitled to vote. History. \u2014 Pennsylvania was granted by king Charles II, to Mr. William Penn, son of the famous admiral Penn, partly in consideration of his father's eminent services, \u2022 The militia of this stale, according to the last returns, amounted to 118,014 effective men."], [451, "431 STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA. and partly on account of a large sum due to him from the crown, a portion of which he offered to remit on condi tion he obtained his grant. The charter was signed by the king on the 4th of March, 1681, and the first frame of government is dated 1682. By this frame, all legislative powers were vested in the governor and freemen of the province, in the form ofa provincial council, and a gene ral assembly. The council was to consist of seventy-two members, chosen by the freemen ; of which the governor or his deputy, was to be perpetual president, with a treble vote : one-third of this council went out of office every year, and their seats were supplied by new elections. The general assembly was at first to consist of all the free men, afterwards of 200, and never to exceed 500. In 1683, Mr. Penn offered another frame of govern ment, in which the number of representatives was re duced, and the governor vested with a negative upon all bills passed in the assembly. By several specious argu ments, the people were induced to accept this frame of government. Not long after, Mr. Penn having occasion to go to England, he committed the administration of government to five commissioners, taken from the council. In 1686, Mr. Penn required the commissioners to dissolve the frame of government ; but not being able to effect his purpose, he, in 1688, appointed captain John Blackwell his deputy : from this period, the proprietors usually re sided in England, and administered the government by deputies, who were devoted to their interest. Jealousies arose between the people and their governors, which never ceased till the revolution. The primary cause of these jealousies, was an attempt of the proprietor to ex tend his own power, and abridge that of the assembly ; and the consequence was incessant disputes and dissensions in the legislature. In 1689, governor Blackwell, finding himself opposed in his views, had recourse to artifice, and prevailed on certato members of the council to withdraw themselves from the house ; thus defeating the measures of the legis lature. The house voted this to be treachery, and ad dressed the governor on the occasion. In 1693, king William and queen Mary assumed the government into their own hands; and colonel Fletcher was appointed governor of New York and Pennsylvania, by one and the same commission, with equal powers in both provinces; by this commission the number of coun sellors in Pennsylvania was reduced. Under the admi nistration of governor Markham, in 1696, a new form of"], [452, "432 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. government was established. The election ofthe council and assembly now became annual, and the legislature, with their powers and forms of proceeding, was new modelled. In 1699, the proprietor arrived from England, and as- sumed the reins of government ; and while he remained in Pennsylvania, the last charter of privileges, or frame of government, which continued to the revolution, was agreed upon and established : this was completed and de- livered to the people, Oct. 28, 1701, just on his embarking for England. The inhabitants of the territory,* as it was then called, in the lower counties, refused to accept this charter, and thus separated themselves from the province of Pennsylvania; they afterwards had their own assem- bly, in which the governor of Pennsylvania used to preside. In September, 1700, the Susquehannah Indians granted to Mr. Penn all their lands on both sides the river ; but in conjunction with the Shawanese, and Potomac Indians, they entered into articles of agreement, by which they were permitted to settle about the head of Potomac river, in tbe province of Pennsylvania : the Conostoga chiefs, also, in 1701, ratified the grant of the Susquehannah Indians, made the preceding year. In 1708, Mr. Penn obtained from the chiefs of the country a confirmation of the grants made by former Indians, of all the lands from Duck creek, in the present state of Delaware, to the mountains, and from the river Delaware to the Susquehannah, In this deed the chiefs declared, that they had seen and heard read divers prior deeds which had been given to Mr. Penn by former chiefs. Philadelphia had been erected into a corporation by the proprietor while he remained in America ; the charter being dated in 1701. By this charter the police of the city was vested in a mayor, recorder, aldermen and com- mon council, with power to enquire into treasons, murders, and other felonies ; and to inquire info and punish smaller crimes. The corporation had also an extensive civil jurisdiction ; but it was dissolved at the revolution, and Philadelphia is governed like other counties in the state. By the favourable terms which Mr. Penn offered to settlers, and an unlimited toleration of all religious deno- minations, the population of the province was extremely rapid. Notwithstanding the attempts of the proprietor, or his governors, to extend his own power and accumu- late property, by procuring grants from the people, and \u2022 This territory now forms the state of Delaware,"], [453, "433 STATE OF DELAWARE. exempting his lands from taxation ; the government was generally mild, and the burdens of the people by no means oppressive. The selfish designs of the proprietors were vigorously and constantly opposed by the assembly, whose firmness preserved the chartered rights of the pro vince. At the revolution, the government was abolished. The proprietors were absent, and the people, by their repre sentatives, formed a new constitution on republican prin ciples ; excluding the proprietors from all share in the government, by offering them \u00a3130,000 in lieu of all quit rents, which was finally accepted. STATE OF DELAWARE. Situation, Boundaries, and Extent. This small state is situated between 38\u00b0 29' and 39\u00b0 48' N. lat. and 1\u00b0 18' and 1\u00b0 58' E. long. It is bounded on the north by Pennsylvania ; south, by Maryland ; east, by Delaware bay and the Atlantic ocean ; and west by Penn sylvania and Maryland. From north to south it is ninety miles in length, and from east to west twenty-five miles in breadth; forming an area of about 1,700 square miles, or 1,088,000 acres. General aspect of the country, climate, soil, and pro ductions. \u2014 The face of a great part of the country is level, abounding with swamps and stagnant water ; which render it equally unfit for the purposes of agriculture, and injurious to the health ofthe inhabitants ; but towards the northern part it is more elevated, and near its extremity there is a considerable chain of hills. Excepting these heights, the surface of the state is very little broken, and the lower country may be said to form one extended plain. In the southern and western parts of the state spring the head waters of Choptank, Nanticock, Poco moke, Wicomico, Chester, Sassafras, and Bohemia rivers; all of which fall into Chesapeak-bay : some of them are navigable twenty or thirty miles into the country, for vessels of fifty or sixty tons burden. The eastern side of the state is indented with a number of creeks, or small rivers, which generally have a short course, soft banks, numerous shoals, and are skirted with very extensive"], [454, "434 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. marshes, and empty into the river and bay of Delaware. The principal of these is Brandywine creek, which falls into the Delaware at Wilmington, and on which there are numerous mills and manufactories. The climate is much influenced by the face of the country ; for the land being low and flat, occasions the waters to stagnate, aud the consequence is, that the inha- bitants are subject to intermittent fevers and agues. The southern parts of the state in particular, having a very moist atmosphere, is often foggy and unwholesome ; but is mild and temperate in winter. The northern parts, on the contrary, are much more agreeable and healthy. The soil in many places is well adapted to the different purposes of agriculture ; and notwithstanding the stagnant waters already mentioned (which are only prevalent at certain seasons of the year) Delaware is chiefly an agri- cultural state, and, upon the whole, contains a very fer- tile tract of country. In Newcastle county, along the river Delaware, and from eight to ten miles into the inte-, rior, the soil is generally a rich clay, in which a great variety of the most useful productions ean be conveniently and plentifully reared ; from thence to the swamps before noticed, the soil is light, sandy, and of an inferior qualify. In the county of Kent, there is a considerable mixture of sand ; and in Sussex, the quantity of sand altogether predominates. The greater part of the inhabitants of this state are de voted to husbandry ; and in every place where the land is capable of cultivation, they have rendered it very pro ductive. Wheat is the staple article of produce, and grows here in such perfection, as not only to be particu larly sought by the manufacturers of flour throughout the United States, but also to be distinguished and preferred sor its superior qualities, in foreign markets. This wheat possesses an uncommon softness and whiteness, and makes the best superfine flour, and in other respects far exceeds she hard and flinty grains raised in general on the higher lands. Next to wheat, the principal productions are rye, Indian corn, barley, oats, flax, and potatoes. Grasses are abundant, and thrive very luxuriantly, furnishing food sor many fine cattle ; and every sort of vegetable common to the states already described, arrive to great perfection here; particularly the various kinds of fruits. The coun ty of Sussex, besides producing considerable quantities of graiu, possesses large tracts of fine grazing land ; and this county also exports lumber to a great amount, obtain ed chiefly from an extensive swamp called the Indian"], [455, "435 STATE OF DELAWARE. river, or Cypress swamp, lying partly within this state, and partly in Maryland. This morass is twelve miles in length and six in breadth, including an area of nearly 60,000 acres of land ; the whole of which is a high and level bason, very wet, though undoubtedly the highest land between the sea and the bay, whence the Poeomoke descends on one side, and Indian river on the other. The swamp contains a great variety of trees, plants, wild beasts, birds and reptiles. There are no mineral pro ductions in this state except iron ; large quantities of bog iron ore, very fit for castings, are found among the branches of Nanticoke river. Before the revolution this ore was worked to a great amount ; but this business, though still carried on, is rather on the decline. Civil divisions, towns, population, religion, character, &c. \u2014 The state of Delaware is divided into three counties, which are subdivided into twenty-five hundreds, contain ing, by the last general census, 72,674 inhabitants, of whom, 4,177 were slaves; being about forty-three indivi duals to the square mile : but by a state enumeration in 1817, the population is said to amount to 108,334. Counties. Hundreds. Population. Chief Towns and Population. Kent 5 20,495 Dover, 800 Newcastle... 9 24,429 Wilmington, 4,406 Sussex 11 27,750 Georgetown, 400 Dover, the seat of government for this state, is situated on Jones's creek, about four miles from its mouth in the Delaware ; and is distant forty-seven miles from Wilming ton, seventy-four from Philadelphia, and eighty-eight front the city of Washington. It is a small place, containing about 150 houses, built mostly of brick. There are four streets, which intersect each other at right angles in the centre of the town ; and the area included within these intersections extends into a handsome parade, on the east side of which is an elegant state-house. The town has a lively appearance, and supports a considerable trade with Philadelphia, chiefly in flour. Wilmington is a thriving town, consisting of about 700 houses, mostly built of brick ; it is situated a mile and a half west of the Delaware, on Christiana creek, 27 miles southward from Philadelphia, and is built on the plan of that fine city. It carries on a very considerable trad\u00ab, principally in flour, manufactured at the celebrated mills on Brandywine creek, half a mile from the town. Therf NO. xix. 3 K"], [456, "436 VN1TED STATES OF AMERICA. are here six places for public worship, viz. two for pres byterians, one for quakers, one for baptists, one methodist, and one Swedish. The other public buildings are a mar ket house, a court-house, a prison, and a flourishing academy. This is much the largest and pleasantest town in the state ; and being built upon the gentle ascent of an eminence, it appears to great advantage as you sail up the Delaware. Newcastle is thirty-two miles below Philadelphia, on the west bank of the Delaware river, and contains about 200 houses, some of them handsome ; but the whole place has rather the appearance of decay. It was first settled by the Swedes in the year 1627, and called Stockholm ; but was afterwards taken by the Dutch, who gave it the name of New Amsterdam : when it fell into the hands of the English they named it Newcastle. The river is here two miles wide, from thence it spreads out into Delaware bay ; the banks are level and covered with wood, and the lands rise to a considerable height at a distance, affording in some places very fine prospects. The only rivers of note that join the Delaware between Newcastle and Phila delphia, are the Schuylkill, and Brandywine creek. Besides the towns already described, which are the most considerable in the state, there are some others of less importance, such as Georgetown, Lewistown, and Milford ; none of then* containing above 600 inhabitants: there are also many villages of inferior note, all in a state of progressive improvement. In this state there is a variety of religious denomina tions ; but the principal sect is that of the presbyterians. Episcopalians are next in number, then baptists ; the methodists are also numerous, especially in the counties of Kent and Sussex : besides these, there is a Swedish episcopal church at Wilmington, which is one of the oldest congregations in the United States. All these de nominations have free toleration by the constitution, and live together in peace and harmony. In character and manners the inhabitants are nowise dissimilar from the people of Pennsylvania. Any shade of difference that may exist, arises from the small number of towns in this state, and most of the citizens being engaged in rural employments. Trade, manufactures, &c. \u2014 Almost the whole of the exports of the Delaware are from Wilmington ; and the trade from this state to Philadelphia is very great, it being"], [457, "437 STATE OF DELAWARE. the principal source whence that city draws its staple commodity. Indeed flour is the chief article of export, and the manufacture of it is carried to a higher degree of perfection here than in any other state of the Union. Besides the well-constructed mills on Red Clay and White Clay creeks, aud other streams in different parts ofthe state, the famous collection of mills at Brandywine, already noticed, merit a particular description. They are called the Brandywine mills, from the stream on which they are erected. This stream rises in Chester county, Pennsylvania, and after a winding course of thirty miles through falls, which furnish numerous mill-seats (above 150 of which are already occupied) flows into Christiana creek, near Wilmington. These mills are in great per- fection, and give employment to upwards of 600 persons, who manufacture not less than 500,000 bushels of wheat annually. The navigation quite up to the mills is such, that a vessel carrying 1,000 bushels of wheat may be laid along side any of them ; while there are some of them that will admit of vessels loaded with double the above quantity. The cargoes are discharged with astonishing expedition : there have been instances of 1,000 bushels of wheat being carried to the height of four stories in four hours. It is frequently the case that shallops carrying the same quantity, come up with flood tide, unload and go away the succeeding ebb with 300 barrels of flour on board. By means of machinery, the wheat is received on the shallop's deck, thence carried to the upper loft of the mill, and a considerable portion of the same returned in flour on the lower floor, ready for packing, without the assistance of manual labour, but in a very small de- gree, in proportion to the business done. The transpor- tation of flour from the mills to the port of Wilmington, does not require half an hour ; and it often happens that a cargo is taken from the mills, and delivered at Phila delphia the same day. Among other branches of industry exercised in and near Wilmington, are cotton manufactories and one for bolting cloths; and throughout the county of Newcastle are a number of fulling-mills, several paper-mills, snuff-mills, two slitting-mills, and upwards of seventy mills for grind ing grain, besides others for sawing timber and stone, all of which are turned by water. Besides the wheat and flour trade, this state carries on a considerable commerce in various other articles ; among which are iron, salted provisions, flaxseed, lumber, paper, &c. The foreign ex ports in 1817 amounted to 44,854 dollars, of which 38,771"], [458, "438 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. was domestic produce. The principal trade with Britain is through the medium of Philadelphia. Constitution.\u2014 At the revolution, the three lower coun ties ou Delaware river became independent, by the name of the Delaware state. Under their present constitution, which was established in September, 1776, the legislature is divided into two distinct branches, which, together, are styled \"The General Assembly of Delaware.\" One branch, called the \" House of Assembly,\" consists of seven repre sentatives from each of the tbree counties, chosen an nually by the freeholders. The other branch, called the \" Council,\" consists of nine members, three for a county, who must be more than twenty-five years of age, chosen likewise by the freeholders. A rotation of members is established by displacing one member for a county at the end of every year. A president or chief magistrate is chosen by the joint ballot of both houses, and continues in office three yrears ; at the expiration of which period, be is ineligible for the three succeeding years. Every white freeman of the age of twenty-one, who has resided in the state two years next before the election, shall enjoy the right of an elector. The sons of persons so qualified shall, between the ages of twenty-one and twenty-two, be entitled to vote, though they have paid no taxes. History. \u2014 The Dutch, under the pretended purchase made of Heary Hudson, already noticed, took possession of the lands on both sides the river Delaware, and, as early as the year 1623, built a fort at the place which has since been called Gloucester, four miles below Phila delphia. Four years afterwards, a colony of Swedes and Finns came over, furnished with every necessary to begin a new settlement, and landed on Cape Henlopen, at the entrance of Delaware bay; at which time the Dutch had wholly quitted the country. In 1630, the Dutch returned, and built a fort at Lewis town, a short distance from Cape Henlopen. The year following the Swedes built a fort near Wilmington, which they called Christiana, in honour of their queen: here also they laid out a small town which was afterwards de molished by the Dutch. The same year they erected a sort higher up the river, upon Tenecum island, which they called New Gottenburgh ; they also at the same time built fort, at Chester, Elsinburgh, and other places."], [459, "439 STATE OF MARYLAND. In 1655, the Dutch arrived in the river Delaware from New Amsterdam (now New York) in seven vessels, with 700 men. They dispossessed the Swedes of their forts on the river, and carried the officers and principal inhabitants prisoners to New Amsterdam, and from thence to Holland. The common people submitted to the conquerors, and remained in the country, ln 1664, sir Robert Carr obtain ed the submission of the Swedes on Delaware river ; and four years after, colonel Nicolls, governor of New York, by the advice of his council, appointed a scout, and five other persons, to assist captain Carr in the government of the country. In 1672, the town of Newcastle was incorporated by the government of New York, to be governed by a bailiff and six assistants ; after the first year, the four oldest were to leave their office, and four others to be chosen. The bailiff was president, with a double vote ; the constable was chosen by the bench : they had power to try causes not exceeding ten pounds, without appeal. The office of scout was converted into that of sheriff, who had juris diction in the corporation and along the river, and was annually chosen. They were to have a free trade, without being obliged to make entry at New York, as had formerly been the practice. In i 674, Charles II., by a second patent, dated June 29th, granted to his brother, the duke of York, all that country called by the Dutch New Netherlands, of which the three counties of Newcastle, Kent, and Sussex, were a part. In 1683, the duke of York sold to William Penn the town of Newcastle, with the district twelve miles round the same ; and at the same time granted to him the remainder ofthe territory, which, till the revolution, was called the three lower counties, and has since been eaiied the state of Delaware. Till 1776, these three counties were consider ed as a part of Pennsylvania. In matters of government, the same governor presided over both ; but the assembly and courts of judicature were composed of different mem bers, though their forms were nearly the same. STATE OF MARYLAND. Situation, Boundaries, and Extent. This state is situated between 38\u00b0 and 39\u00b0 43' N. lat. and 2\u00b0 E. and 2\u00b0 30' W. long. It is bounded on the north by Pennsylvania ; south and west it has Virginia and the"], [460, "440 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. Atlantic ocean, and east by the state of Delaware and the same ocean. Its length from east to west is 198 miles, and its breadth from north to south ninety miles ing 10,800 square miles, or, 6,912,000 acres, of which about one-sixth part is water. Bays, rivers, and face of the country. \u2014 Chesapeak bay has already been noticed, page 32 ; but it merits a more particular description, from its vast importance to this state, aud indeed to the United States generally. This bay is formed by the outlet of the Susquehannah river, where it receives French creek, and a number of smaller streams. It is there about seven miles broad, and so con tinues to near the branch that leads up to Baltimore ; from thence it assumes various breadths, from ten to fifteen miles, during a course downwards of about seventy miles, to near the Potomac river. It then stretches out to twenty-five or thirty miles, during a passage of ninety miles more, and finally passes into the Atlantic ocean by an outlet of twelve miles broad. The whole exteut of this grand bay from north to south, is upwards of 270 miles, and it receives in its course the entire waters of this state, nearly all those of the eastern part of Virginia, a principal part of the Pennsylvania rivers, and some from the state of Delaware ; exhibiting a greater con fluence of waters than is to be seen in any quarter of the United States, or almost in the world. The Chesapeak divides this state into eastern and western divisions. From the eastern shore in Maryland, among other smaller ones, it receives Pokomoke, Nanticoke, Choptank, Chester, Elke, Wye, Sassafras, and Bohemia rivers. From the north, the rapid Susquehannah ; and from the west Pa fapsco, Severn, Patuxent, Potomac, (half of which is in Maryland and half in Virginia,) Gunpowder, and Wicomico : except the Susquehannab and Potomac, these are small rivers. Patapseo river rises in York county, Pennsylvania, and pursues a south-east course till it reaches Elkridge, about eight miles south-west of Baltimore ; it there turns east wardly over falls, and widens into a broad bay-like stream to its mouth. It is about forty yards wide just before it communicates with the bason on which stands the large commercial town of Baltimore ; which it leaves on the north, and passes into the Chesapeak. It is navigable for vessels drawing eighteen feet water to Fell's Point at Baltimore ; but the falls above Elkridge prevent the navi_"], [461, "441 STATE OF MARYLAND. gation farther. The entrance into the harbour, about a mile below Fell's Point, is hardly pistol shot across, and of course may be easily defended against naval force. Patuxent is a larger river than the Patapseo, rises near the same source, aud empties into Chesapeak bay about twenty miles north of the mouth of Potomac. It admits vessels of 250 tons to Nottingham, forty-six miles from its mouth, and boats twelve miles higher. Patuxent is as remarkable a river as any iu the bay, having very high laud on its north side, with red banks or cliffs. The face of the country is remarkably variegated. Its south-west boundary line is formed by the river Potomac ; and the fine bay of Chesapeak, with its numerous waters, passes through the middle of it. On the east side, it pre sents a coast of about thirty-five miles to the Atlantic ocean, low, level, and in general sandy; but in many places covered with stagnant water, except when it is intersected by numerous creeks. The land continues to rise by a gentle ascent, but is generally level to Baltimore, 160 miles from the sea ; it then swells out into a hilly country7, till it reaches the Blue ridge of mountains, which stretches across the western part of this state, and passes through Pennsylvania and Virginia. East of these moun tains, the laud, like that in all the southern states, is gene rally level and free from stones ; and appears to have been made much in the same way : of course the soil must be similar, and the natural growth not materially different. The nortbern parts of the state are varied with hills and valleys. Climate, soil, and productions. \u2014 The climate is various in different districts, but for the most part mild and agree able, well suited to agricultural productions, and particu larly fruit trees. The eastern parts are similar to Dela ware, having large tracts of marsh, which during the day load the atmosphere with vapour, that falls in dew in the close ofthe summer and autumn, which are unhealthy, and indicated by a sickly colour in the inhabitants, who are subject to intermittent fevers. In the interior hilly country the climate improves very much, and among the mountains it is delightful and healthy ; the summers be ing cooled by fine breezes, while the winters are tempered by a southern latitude, which renders them much milder than to the northward. . The soil is as various as the climate ; and a great portion of it is rather poor. The swamps on the eastern shore"], [462, "442 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. are nearly useless ; but in the interior there are a con siderable number of fertile tracts ; though the greater part of the land is inferior until you pass the first ridge of mountains, when there is a fruitful valley of twelve or fourteen miles broad. From thence the soil approaches nearly to the mouutainous district of Pennsylvania. The good land in this state is of such a nature and quality as to produce from fourteen to eighteen bushels of wheat, or about thirty bushels of Indian corn an acre. The average crops throughout the state may be twelve bushels of wheat and twenty of corn. Wheat and tobacco are the staple commodities of Mary land ; but in the interior country, on the uplands, consi derable quantities of hemp and flax are raised. Tobacco is generally cultivated by negroes, in sets or companies, in the following manner: the seed is sown in beds of fine mould, and transplanted the beginning of May. The plants are set at the distance of three or four feet from each other, and are hilled and kept continually free from weeds. When as many leaves have shot out as the soil will nourish to advantage, the top of the plant is broken off, which prevents it from growing higher. It is care fully kept clear of worms, and the suckers, which put out between the leaves, are taken off at proper times, till the plant arrives at perfection, which is in August. When the leaves turn of a brownish colour, and begin to be spotted, the plant is cut down and hung up to dry, after having sweated in heaps one night. When it can be handled without crumbling, which is always in moist weather, the leaves are stripped from the stalk, tied in bundles, and packed for exportation in hogsheads con taining eight or 9001b. No suckers nor ground leaves are allowed to be merchantable. An industrious person may manage 6,000 plants of tobacco (which yield 1,0001b.) and four acres of Indian corn. The farms and plantations consist, in general, of from 100 fo 1,000 acres. In the upper parts of the state, towards the mountains, the land is divided into small portions ; grain is principally cultivated, and there are sew slaves. In the lower parts, the plantations are extensive ; large quantities of tobacco are raised, and the labour is per formed almost entirely by negroes. The persons residing upon these large plantations have their stewards and overseers, and give themselves but little trouble about tbe management of their lands. The clothing for the slaves, and most of the implements of husbandry, are manufactured ou each estate ; and the quarters of th."], [463, "443 STATE OF MARYLAND. negroes are situated in the neighbourhood of the princi- pal dwelling-house, which gives the residence of every planter the appearance of a little village. The houses are for the most part built of wood, and painted with Spanish brown ; and in front there is generally a long porch painted white. Log-houses are very common in many parts of this state ; and as they are cheaper than auy others, in a country abounding with wood, and gene- rally the first that are erected on a new settlement in America, a description of them in this place may not be uninteresting. The sides consist of trees just squared, and placed horizontally one upon the other ; the ends of the logs of one side resting alternately on the ends of those of the adjoining sides, in notches ; the spaces between the logs are fitted with clay, and the roof is covered with boards or with shingles, which are small pieces of wood in the shape of slates or tiles, and which are commonly used for that purpose. These habitations are not very sightly ; but when well built they are warm and comfort- able, and last for a long time. Besides the articles of produce already mentioned, cot- ton is raised in some places ; but it is of rather an inferior quality. The gardens produce excellent roots and vege- tables, and the fruit of the orchards is equal to any in the other states ; apples, pears, peaches, plums, and cherries are plenty and cheap : from the apples and peaches much brandy is manufactured. The natural productions of the forests are oak, walnut, hickory, ash, chesnut, sassafras, magnolia, and several kinds of pine. The woods abound with nuts of various kinds, which are collectively called mast ; on this mast vast numbers of swine are fed, which run wild among the trees. These swine, when fatted, are caught, killed, barrelled, and exported in great quan tities. The chief mineral productions are iron and copper. No works of any consequence have as yet been establish- ed for the manufacture of the latter ; but there are many extensive iron works. Coal has also been discovered ; but not in sufficient quantity to make it an object of im portance. Civil divisions, towns, population, religion, and cha racter. \u2014 Maryland is divided into nineteen counties, but not subdivided into townships or hundreds, as the states already described. Ten of these counties are on the western, and nine on the eastern shores of Chesapeak bay. The number of inhabitants, by the last general 3_"], [464, "444 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. census, amounted to 380,546, including 111,502 slaves, being about thirty-five to the square mile ; but when Ihe proportion of water is deducted, there will be above forty- three inhabitants to each square mile: a denser popula- tion than any state in the Union, excepting Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island. \u2014 By the state census of 1817, the population was returned at 502,710; being an increase of 122,164 in seven years.

It is a place of little note in the commercial world ; but being in a pleasant situation, and commanding a beautiful prospect of the Chesapeak and the shore on the other side of the bay, it is the residence of a great many people in genteel circum- stances. The houses are about 300 in number, buili of brick, and for the most part large and elegant, denoting great wealth. The state-house is one of the most superb structures in the United States ; the other public build ings are, a college, one episcopal and one methodist church,"], [465, ""], [466, "BA_LTIMOKE,A^r?rA\"POLis. Si"], [467, "445 STATE OF MARYLAND. a market-bouse, and a theatre. From the centre of the city, where the state-house stauds, the streets diverge in every direction, like radii; and most part of the buildings are arranged according to this awkward plan. The city of Baltimore is situated on the north side of tli\u00a3 Patapseo river, on a branch called the Bason, fifteen innes from Chesapeak bay, and 160 from the Atlantic ocean. No other town in the United States, except New Orleans, has made so rapid a progress in wealth and popu lation as Baltimore. At the commencement of the war, in 1775, it was but an inconsiderable village ; but such has been the astonishing rapidity of its growth, that it is now the third commercial city in the Union. The plan of the town is somewhat similar to that of Philadelphia, most of the slreets crossing each other at right angles. The main street, which runs nearly east and west, is about eighty feet wide ; the others are from forty to sixty feet : the houses are generally built of brick, and many of them very elegant. The principal public buildings are a court house, a jail, three market-houses, a work -house, an ex change, a theatre, an observatory, assembly rooms, library, aud eighteen places for worship, belonging to Roman catholics, German Calvinists and Lutherans, episcopa lians, presbyterians, baptists, methodists, quakers, Sweden borgians, Nicolites, or new quakers, and Unitarians. The last-named sect have just erected (1819) a most superb church, which for external elegance and internal beauty far exceeds any similar edifice in the United States. Baltimore is divided into the town and Fell's Point by a creek, over which are two bridges; at this place wharfs have been built, along side whicb vessels of 600 tons burden can lie with perfect safety. Numbers of persons have been induced to settle on this Point on account of the shipping ; and regular streets have been laid out, with a large market-place. But though these buildings, gene rally speaking, are considered as part of Baltimore ; yet thev are a mile distant from the other part of the town. Tlie whole city exhibits a very handsome appearance ; artd the adjoining country abounds in villas, gardens, and well -cultivated fields: towards the north and east, the land rises, and presents a noble view of the town and bay. This city, from its fine situation, must naturally con tinue to rise into great importance ; and being forty-eight miles nearer to Pittsburgh than Philadelphia, will always be a great thoroughfare for people passing into the western country. The inhabitants of Maryland seem aware of this, and to secure a preference, are acting; with a laudable."], [468, "446 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. zeal in making good roads ; and the great national turn pike which is now constructing between Cumberland, 148 miles above Baltimore, and Wheeling, on the river Ohio, fifty-eight miles by land, and 100 by water below Pitts burgh, will be a powerful means of causing the great tide of emigration from Europe to the western states to pass through Baltimore. The inhabitants of this city are col lected from most parts of Europe ; but the English, Irish, Scotch, and French greatly predominate. Of these the Irish appear to be the most numerous; and many of the principal merchants ofthe town are in the number. Wilh a few exceptions, the citizens are all engaged in trade, which is closely attended to ; their main object (in which, indeed, they are far from being singular) seems to be to make their fortunes in this world. They are mostly plain, sociable people, maintaining a kind and improving inter course with each other, and are very friendly and hospita ble to strangers. Baltimore is 39J miles distant from Washington, 100 miles from Philadelphia, 191 from New York, 423 from Boston, 228 from Pittsburgh, 584 from Charleston, 540 from Lexington, 436 from Chilicothe, 928 (by the Ohio) from Louisville, and 1224 from New Orleans. North lat. 39\u00b0 31'.. Fredericktown is situated forty-two miles from Balti more, on the Pittsburgh road, and is a flourishing place, carrying on considerable manufactures, and a brisk inland trade through a fertile and well-cultivated country. It contains a court-house, academy, market-house, jail, and seven places of public worship for German Lutherans, Calvinists, presbyterians, baptists, and methodists. The arsenal of the state of Maryland is placed here, the situ ation being secure and central. Elizabethtown (formerly Hagersfown) is situated beyond the first range of mountains, in a fertile valley, and car ries on a considerable trade wish the western country. The houses are principally built of brick and stone, and there are several streets regularly and handsomely laid out. The episcopalians, presbyterians, and German Lutherans have each a church. The court-house, and market-house are handsome buildings, and the jail is of stone, substantial and well built. Elkton is seated at the head of Chesapeak bay, thirteen miles from the mouth of Elk river, and fifty-six north east of Baltimore.

Baltimore, or the neighbouring mills. Elkton consists chiefly of one street, in which are about 100 houses, a court-house, academy, and jail. Besides these, there are a great number of small towns and villages, containing from 100 to 1,000 inhabitants; but none of them are of sufficient importance to require a particular description. The Roman catholics, who were the first settlers, are the most numerous religious sect in Maryland. There are also episcopalians, English, Scotch, and Irish presby terians, German Calvinists, and Lutherans, quakers, bap tists, methodists, mennouists, Nicolites, and Unitarians. All these sects live together in friendship and good will ; worshipping God according to the rites of their respec tive churches, and agreeably to the dictates of their own consciences, without disputing or interfering concerning each others religious opinions. The inhabitants of this state, except in the towns aud villages, live on their plantations, often several miles dis tant from each other ; you therefore observe little of that cheerfulness of look and action which is the offspring of social intercourse- As the negroes perform all the manual labour, their masters are left to saunter away life in sloth, and too often in ignorance ; and there is apparently a dis consolate wildness in their countenances, and an indolence in their whole behaviour, which are evidently the effects of solitude, and of the existence of slavery. Notwith standing these observations, which a regard to truth imperiously demand, yet national advancement have kept pace with the prosperity and wealth of the people ; and the rising towns, cultivated farms, bridges and roads, are all so many proofs that the citizens of Maryland are not behind their brethren in public spirit and general improve ment. Considerable funds are appropriated to the support of education ; there are five colleges, and a number of very respectable academies in the state, and commoa schools are established in every county. Trade, manufactures, and agriculture. \u2014 In point of foreign trade this state ranks the fourth iu the Union, and as the greater part of it centres in Baltimore, it must necessarily add greatly to its wealth and importance. A great portion of the export trade is flour, much of which is received from the state of Pennsylvania ; and the citi zens have a brisk trade in importing and reshipping foreign articles, particularly West India produce, rum, sugar, and"], [470, "448 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. coffee. To Europe and the West Indies they export tobacco to a great amount ; besides large quantities of wheat, pig iron, lumber, beans, and flax-seed. The total foreign exports for the year 1817 amounted in value to 3,046,046 dollars ; and to the other states, to 5,887,884 dollars. The principal part of the imports are manu factored goods from Britain, and having to supply the demand of an immense back country, this is an increas ing trade. It has been already stated, that mines of iron are nume- rous in this state. Furnaces for running this ore into pigs and hollow ware, and forges to refine pig iron into bars, have been erected in a number of places in the neighbour- hood of the mines. The iron is of a remarkably tough qualify, and the utensils made of it, as pots, kettles, (fee. though cast much thinner than is usual in England, will admit of being pitched into carts, and thrown about, without any danger of being broken. The forges and furnaces are all worked by negroes, who seem to be par- ticularly suited to such an occupation, not only on account of their sable complexions, but because they can sustain a much greater degree of heat than white persons, without any inconvenience. In the hottest days in sum- mer they are never without fires in their huts. In addi- tion to the iron manufacture, the following are carried on io a considerable extent, viz. ships, cordage, paper, saddlery, boots and shoes, hats, wool and cotton cards ; and an immense quantity of wheat made into flour for exportation. This is the first state in which there is a material differ ence of agriculture from the northern states ; still, how ever, the staple crop is wheat ; but they raise a consider able quantity of tobacco, and some cotton, though the latter is not an article of export. All the other grains, grasses, and roots that grow in the states to the eastward, flourish here; and the sweet potatoe, a root belonging to a warm climate, comes to considerable maturity. Constitution. \u2014 The civil government of this state is vested in a governor, senate, and house of delegates, all chosen annually. The senators are elected in the follow ing manner : on the first of September every fifth year, the freemen choose two men in each county to be elector* of the senate, and one elector for Annapolis and anc ther for Baltimore. The electors must have the qualification*"], [471, "449 STATE OF MARYLAND. necessary for county delegates. They meet at Annapolis on the third Monday in September, and elect by ballot fifteen senators out of their own body, or from the people at large. Nine of these must be residents on the western shore, and six on the eastern ; they must be more than twenty-five years of age, must have resided in the state more than three years next preceding the election, and have real and personal property above the value of \u00a31,000. In case of death, resignation, or inability of any senator, during the five years for which he is elected, the vacancy is filled by the senate. The senate choose tbeir president by ballot. The house of delegates is composed of four members from each county, chosen annually in October ; Annapolis and Baltimore send each two delegates. The qualifications of a delegate are, full age, one year's resi dence in the county where he is chosen, and real or per sonal property above the value of \u00a3500. The election of senators and delegates is viva voce, and sheriffs the re turning officers, except in Baltimore towu, where the commissioners superintend the elections and make the returns. Every free white male citizen ofthe state, above twenty-one years of age, having resided twelve months in the election district, next before the time of the elec tion, may vote for delegates to the general assembly and electors of the senate. On tlie second Monday in Novem ber, annually, a governor is appointed by the joint ballot of both houses, taken in each house respectively, and deposited in a conference room, where the boxes are examined by a joint committee of both houses, and the number of votes severally reported. The governor can not continue in office more than three years successively, nor be elected until the expiration of four years after he has been out of office. The qualifications for the chief magistracy are* twenty-five years of age, five years resi dence in the state, next preceding the election, and real and personal estate above the value of \u00a35,000, one-fifth of which must be freehold estate. On the second Tues day of November, annually, the senators and delegates elect, by joint ballot, five able discreet men, above twenty five years of age, residents in the state three years next preceding the election, and possessing a freehold of lands and tenements above the value of \u00a31,000, to be a council for assisting the governor in the duties of his office. Senators, delegates, and members of council, while such, can hold no other office of profit, nor receive the profits of any office held by another. Ministers of the gospel are excluded from civil offices."], [472, "450 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. History. \u2014 Maryland was granted by king Charles I. to Cecilius Calvert, baron of Baltimore, in Ireland, June 20th. 1632. The government of the province was by the charter vested in the proprietor; but it appears that he either never exercised these powers alone, or but for a short time ; for we find that in 1637, the freemen rejected a body of laws drawn up in England, and transmitted by his lordship, in order to be passed for the government of the province. In the place of these they proposed forty- two bills to be enacted into laws, by the conspnt of the proprietor. These, however, were never enacted, at least they are not on record. The hon. Leonard Calvert, lord Baltimore's brother, was the first governor, or lieutenant- general. In 1638, a law was passed, constituting the first regular house of assembly, which was to consist of such representatives, called burgesses, as should be elected pursuant to writs issued by the governor. These bur- gesses possessed all the powers of the persons electing them ; but any other freemen, who did not assent to the election, might take their seats in person. Twelve bur- gesses or freemen, with the lieut. -general and secretary, constituted the assembly or legislature. This assembly sat at St. Mary's, one of the southern counties, which was the first settled part of Maryland. In 1642, it was enacted that ten members of the assem- bly, of whom the governor and six burgesses were to be seven, should be a house ; and if sickness should prevent that number from attending, the members present should make a house. Two years afterwards, one Ingle excited a rebellion, forced the governor to fly to Virginia for aid and protection, and seized the records and great seal ; the last of which, with most of the public papers, were lost or destroyed. From this period to the year 1647, when order was restored, the proceedings of the province were involved in obscurity'. In 1650, an act was passed divid- ing the assembly into two houses. The governor, secre tary, and any one or more of the council, formed the upper house ; the delegates from the several hundreds, who now represent the freemen, formed the lower house. At this time there were in the province but two counties, St Mary's, and the Isle of Kent; but Ann Arundel was added the same session. In 1654, during Cromwell's government, an act was passed restraining the exercise of the Roman catholic reli gion. This must have been procured byT the mere terror of Cromwell's power, sor the first and principal inhabit ants were catholics. Indeed, the power of Cromwell was"], [473, "451 DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. not established iu Maryland without force and bloodshed; his friends and foes came to an open rupture, an engage ment ensued, the governor was taken prisoner, and con demned to be shot. This sentence, however, was not executed ; but he was kept a long time in confinement. In March, 1658, Josiah Fendall,esq. was appointed lieut. general of the province, by commission from Oliver Cromwell. He dissolved the upper house, and surrendered the powers of government into the hands of the delegates. Upon the restoration in 1660, the bon. Philip Calvert was appointed governor ; the old form of government was re vived ; Feudall, and one Gerrard, a counsellor, were indicted, found guilty, and condemned to banishment, with the loss of their estates ; but upon petition they were pardoned. In 1689, the government was taken out of the hands of lord Baltimore by the grand convention of England, and in 1692, Lionel Copley, esq. was appointed governor by commission from William and Mary. This year the protestant religion was established by law. In 1699, it was enacted that Annapolis should be tbe seat of govern ment. In 1716, the government of this province was re stored to the proprietor, and continued in his hands till the revolution, when, being an absentee, his property in the lands was confiscated, and the government assumed by the freemen of the province, who formed the constitu tion now existing. DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. Situation, Boundaries, and Extent. The district of Columbia, in which stands the city of Washington, is situated between 38* 48' and 38\u00b0 59' N. lat. and 7' E. and 7' W. long. The Capitol is about 77\u00b0 0' 22\" W. from London. This district is bounded on the north east, south-east, and partly north-west, by Maryland ; and on the south-west and partly north-west, by Virginia. It is exactly ten miles square, being 100 square miles, or 64,000 acres ; it was ceded to the United States by the states of Virginia and Maryland, and in the year 1800 be came the seat of general government. Columbia is beauti fully situated on both sides the Potomac river, and 3 M"], [474, "452 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. abounds with elegant prospects; that part of it which lies west ofthe Potomac is subject to the laws of Virginia, and east of theriver, to those of Maryland ; but the whole is under the special direction of the government of the United States, and the internal police of Washington is managed by a corporation, of which the president of the States appoints the mayor : the other members are elected by the people. Rivers, aspect of the country, &c. \u2014 The rivers which water this district are the Potomac, Tiber creek, Reedy creek, Rock creek, and Four-mile-run. The first only, merits a particular description. The Potomac rises from a spring on the north-west side ofthe Allegany mountains, and after running in a meandring direction for upwards of 400 miles, falls into Chesapeak bay by a mouth seven miles wide. Sixty miles from its source, and 105 above the city of Washington, stands fort Cumberland, here it makes a bend, and by a serpentine course, nearly south east, runs eighteen miles to where it receives the south west branch. It then turns north-east, and after a wind ing course of forty-five miles, in which it receives several tributary streams, reaches Hancock's-town, ninety-nine miles west of Baltimore. From thence it runs in a south east direction for nine miles, where it is joined by Licking creek, and passes the North mountain into a fine limestone valley, which it wafers for about 45 miles. In this valley it receives many small streams, particularly Couecoheague creek, at Williarhsport, in the middle of the valley. At the extremity it is increased by the waters of the Shenan doah from Virginia ; and, by a singularly grand passage, issues through the Blue mountain. It then passes on about 30 miles, where, by two different falls, in the course of eight or ten miles, it descends above 140 feet to the level of tide-water, which it meets at Georgetown. The river now increases to a mile broad, and, passing Alex andria and Mount Vernon, runs a southerly course to thirty-five miles below Alexandria, where it makes a great bend of fifteen miles fo the north-east. Its breadth now gradually increases, and running fifty miles below this bend, flows into Chesapeak bay, as above described. It is navigable for ships of any burden to Alexandria, a distance of 100 miles, and about 180 from the Capes of Virginia; and from thence for vessels of considerable bur- den to Georgetown, at the head of tide-water. Ronnd -the first falls, there is a lock navigation constructed with"], [475, "453 DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. great labour and expense. Considerable improvements have been made further up the river, and it is presumed, that by following up these improvements, the river can be made navigable to Cumberland, the elevation being 700 feet above the level of the sea. From Cumberland to Brownsville, on the Monongahela, a distance of seventy two miles across the mountains, a road has been made, on which the angle of ascent is no where more than five degrees. From Brownsville there is an easy navigation to Pittsburgh, distance thirty-three miles. The face of the country on the road from Baltimore to Washington, especially when approaching the latter city, appears somewhat rough and uneven, and the soil not very fertile, but rather poor and Sandy. The climate is the same as the middle district of Maryland ; and if an opinion may be formed from the countenances of the people, it caunot be healthy. The land is high and dry ; but the whole flat country of Virginia and North Carolina lies to the south of it, and when the wind blows from that quarter, it must waft a great deal of marsh effluvia along with it, of which the people in this district wiU receive a large share. Civil divisions, population, <fec. \u2014 Columbia is divided into two counties, one on each side the Potomac, and con- tained by the last census 24,023 inhabitants, of whom 5,395. were slaves. But by the enumeration of 1817 the popu lation is stated to amount to 37,892, being upwards of 378. to the square mile. Counties, Ifc. Population. Washington county, exclusive ofthe city and Georgetown 2,315 Ditto city 8,208 Georgetown 4,948 Alexandria county 1,325 Ditto city 7,227 Washington city is situated in the centre of the district, and is bounded on the south-east by the eastern branch of the Potomac river, to the south-west by the western branch, to the north-west by Rock creek, and to the north-east by the open country. The plan of this eity appears to contain some important improvements upon that of the best planned cities in the world ; combining, in a remarkable degree, convenience, regularity, elegance of prospect, and a free circulation of air. Its extreme"], [476, "454 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. length from north-west to south-east is little more than four miles and a half, and its medium breadth from north east to south-west about two miles and a half; being nearly the dimensions of London and Southwark. In the plan of the city which has been published, there are thirty-seven squares, seventeen grand avenues, named. after different states, and 103 streets crossing each other at right angles, and running the whole length and breadth of the eity. The positions for the different public edifices, and for the several squares and areas of various shapes as they are laid down, were first determined on the most advantageous ground, commanding extensive prospects, and from their situation, susceptible of such improve ments as either use or ornament may hereafter require. The capitol is situated on a most beautiful eminence of seventy-eight feet, from which there is a fine view of every part of the city, and ofa considerable part ofthe country around. The president's house, a stately mansion, stands on a rising ground, possessing a delightful water prospect, together with a commanding view of the capitol, and the most material parts of the city. On the one side of the president's house, is the treasury-office, and on the other side a similar building which accommodates the officers of state, and the war and naval departments. These elegant buildings were burnt in the late war ; but the last mentioned offices have been rebuilt, and the capitol and president's house are repairing, and will soon be more splendid than ever. The foundations of two new buildings for public offices were laid in 1818; and the centre building of the capitol is also begun, and great activity used in preparing the marble columns which are to decorate the house of congress. The other public buildings are three places for public worship, viz. one each for Roman catholics, baptists, and episcopalians ; a jail, a general post-office, and three market-houses, which are tolerably well supplied ; but every article is dear, the prices being one-third higher than at Philadelphia. The whole country round is handsomely settled, with elegant houses; and the prospect is terminated to the west, south-west, and north-west with high lands. To the south is the river Potomac, with Alexandria, at seven miles distance, pleasantly situated npon its banks. The navy- yard and shipping-, and the barracks, are seen to the south-east and eastward ; and to the west the pre sident's house, abont a mile distant, beyond which stands Georgetown, abont three miles from the capitol. The principal manufactures are .those calculated for"], [477, "455 DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. domestic consumption, boots, shoes, hats, &c. There is a considerable retail trade, but very little of any other ; the shipping business is carried on at Alexandria, and the inland trade at Georgetown. The inhabitants are a col lection from all parts of the Union, and there are many foreigners among (hem. They are reputed to be orderly and correct in their morals, and have bent their attention very much to the subjects of education and general im provement. Georgetown is pleasantly situated upon the side of a hill, on the northern bank of the Potomac, and is bound ed eastward by Rock creek, which separates it from Washington city. It contains upwards of 300 brick houses, and several of them are elegant. The public buildings are five places for worship, an academy, and a bank. The Roman catholics have established a college here, for the promotion of general literature, which is in a flourishing state. The town is regularly laid out, and compactly built, and is a place of considerable trade, which, in con sequeuce of the rapid settlement of the back country, is daily increasing. Alexandria is situated on the west bank ofthe Potomac, in the south-east corner of the district of Columbia; its situation is elevated and pleasant, and the soil clayey. It is laid out on the plan of Philadelphia, the streets crossing one another at right angles, and they are broad and airy, commodious and well paved. The public buildings are a court-house, and jail, a bank, and an episcopal church. The inhabitants carry on a considerable commerce, prin cipally in flour and tobacco ; but when the navigation of the Potomac is completed, this city, in consequence of its vicinity to the seat of government, bids fair to be one of the most prosperous commercial places in the United States. It has been, indeed, supposed by some, that Alexandria and Georgetown will draw the greater part ofthe country trade to themselves, to the prejudice of the federal city ; and this opinion is founded upon the large quantities of produce that are sent down the Potomac to each of these towns, and the supply of foreign manufactures sent back in return. But there cannot be a doubt that in a sew years Washington will completely eclipse the other two: for though Georgetown can furnish the people of the back country with European manufactures, it is at second-hand only, from Baltimore and Philadelphia. Alexandria, it is true, imports from Europe, but it is on a very contracted scale: more than one half the goods which are sent from"], [478, "456 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. thence to the back country, are procured in the same man ner as at Georgetown. Besides, the establishment of the national bank, the residence of the government, and the removal of many merchants of great capital to Washing ton, will afford the people of that city a decided advan tage over Alexandria and Georgetown. Added to all this, both these towns being in the district of Columbia, which is subject to the laws and regulations of congress alone, so far as relates to trade and manufactures, it may be therefore naturally supposed, that encouragements will be held out by government to those who settle in the metropolis, which will be denied to such as fix in any other part of the district. Although Alexandria and Georgetown, then, may rival Washington while it is in its infancy, yet it cannot be imagined that either of them will be able to cope with it in the end. STATE OF VIRGINIA. Situation, Boundaries, and Extent. This state is situated between 36\u00b0 30' and 40\u00b0 43' N. lat. and 1\u00b0 40' E. and 6\u00b0 20' W. long. It is bounded on the north by Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Ohio; south, by North Carolina and Tennessee ; east, by Maryland and the Atlantic ocean ; and west, by Kentucky and Ohio. Its length from east to west is 370 miles, and its breadth from north to south 220 miles, forming an area of about 64,000 square miles, or 40,960,000 acres ; being nearly as large as the island of Great Britain. Rivers and mountains. \u2014 James river is one of the most important iu this state. It rises near the Allegany moun tains, nearly 200 miles west of Richmond, and receives the waters of the Appomatox, about twenty-five miles be low that city. From thence it takes a crooked course of about seventy miles, and falls into Chesapeak bay, fifteen miles to the westward of Cape Henry ; its whole length, including its windings, being upwards of 300 miles. The principal tributary streams to this river are the Riyannah^"], [479, "457 STATE OF VIRGINIA. en which stands Monticello, the seat of the late president Jefferson, the Appomatox, the Chickahominy, the Nanse mond, and the Elizabeth, on which the city of Norfolk is situated. The whole of Elizabeth river is a harbour, and would contain 300 sail of vessels. The channel is from 150 to 200 fathoms wide, and at flood tide affords eighteen feet water to Norfolk. The Nansemond is navi gable for vessels of 100 tons to Suffolk, 110 miles from Richmond. The Chickahominy has at its mouth a bar, on which is only twelve feet water at flood tide. Vessels passing that, may go eight miles up the river; those of ten feet water may go four miles further, and those of six tons burden twenty miles further. The Rivannah is navigable for canoes and batteaux twenty-two miles, to the South west mountains, aud may be easily opened to navigation through these mountains to Charlottsville, eighty-one miles from Richmond. A company has been formed for improving the naviga tion of James river, which at Richmond is obstructed by falls, Upwards of 200,000 dollars have been already ex pended, and a canal formed by which the falls are avoided ; but much yet remains to be done ; the company being bound to remove all obstructions in the river as far as Pattensburgh, in the middle of the mountains, and distant from Richmond upwards of 200 mites. York river, at Yorktown, seventy-two miles from Rich mond, is one mile in breadth, and affords the best harbour in the state for vessels of the largest size. It has four fathoms water for twenty miles above York, to the mouth of the Propotank, where the river is a mile and a half wide, though the channel is only seventy-five fathoms. At the confluence ofthe Pamunky and Mattapony (which form York river) it is but three fathoms depth, which con tinues up the Pamunky to Cumberland, thirty miles from' Richmond, where the width is 100 yards, and up Matta pony to within two miles of Frazer's ferry, where it be comes twenty-eight fathoms deep, and holds that depth about five miles : the Mattapony is navigable sor loaded floats sixty miles from its mouth. The Atlantic rivers having been noticed, the others are but few in number. The state is watered to the westward by the Ohio upwards of 240 miles, and Great Sandy river forms the boundary for above 100 miles between it and Kentucky. The most important river to the westward is the Great Kanhaway, celebrated sor the fertility of the land on its banks, and still more, as leading to the head waters of James river ; but it is doubtful whether its nume-"], [480, "458 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. rous falls will admit a navigation. The great obstacles begin at the falls, ninety miles above ils mouth, below which are only five or six rapids, and these passable, with some difficulty, even at low water. From the fails to the mouth of Green Briar Tiver is 100 miles, aud thence to the lead mines is 120. The Great Kanhaway falls into the Ohio 252 miles below Pittsburgh, by a mouth 280 yards wide. The Little Kanhaway is a small navigable river which falls into the Ohio, by a mouth 150 yards wide, eighty-two miles above the Great Kanhaway ; it can be navigated only ten miles. The Shenandoah river rises ia Augusta county, Virgiuia, and after running a north-east course of about 250 miles, through the great Limestone valley, falls into the Potomac just above the Blue mountains. It is navigable 100 miles, and may be rendered so nearly its whole course, at a small expense: when this is done, it will bear the produce of the richest part of the state to the city of Washington. The mountains of the Blue ridge, and of these, the Peaks of Otter are thought to be a greater height than any others in Virginia, and perhaps in North America. The ridge of mountains next beyond the Blue Ridge, called the North mountain, is of the greatest extent; for which reason they are named by the Indians the Endless mountains. It is deserving of notice, that the mountains are not scattered singly over the face of the country ; but commence about 150 miles from the sea-coast, and are disposed iu ridges one behind another, running nearly parallel with the Atlantic ocean. In the same direction generally are the veins of limestone, coal, and other minerals, and so range the falls of the great rivers; but their courses are at right angles with these. The moun tainous district iu Virginia is about 100 miles in breadth, and the ridges continue, as in Pennsylvania, to range from north-east to south-west. The Allegany chain, from which the rest take their name, is the great ridge which divides the waters of the Atlantic from the Mississippi, and its summit is more elevated above the ocean than that of the others ; but its relative height, compared with the base on which it stands, is not so great, because the country rises behind the respective ridges like steps of stairs. The most elevated point does not exceed 4,000 feet, and few amount to more than 2,500 Climate, face of country, soil, produce, &c. \u2014 The climate ef Virginia is very various, as may be expected in"], [481, "459 STATE OF VIRGINIA. a country of such extent, and it is subject to great and sudden changes. In the greater part of the state, below the head. of the tide-waters, the summers are hot and sultry, and the winters mild. From thence to the foot of the mountains the air is more pure and elastic, and. both summers aud winters are several degrees of temperature below the low country. Among the mountains the sum- mers are delightful, and the heat never sound to be so oppressive as it is in the Atlantic districts ; the winters are so mild in general, that snow seldom lies three days to- gether on the ground. The salubrity of the climate also is equal to that of any part of the United States ; and the inhabitants have in consequence a healthy ruddy appear- ance. Perhaps there is no part of North America where the climate would be more congenial to a British constitu- tion, than iu that section of Virginia which lies west of the Blue ridge; and in particular, the fertile county of Bottetourt, which is entirely surrounded by mouutains. Here the frost in winter is more regular, but not severer than commonly takes place in England. In summer the heat is, perhaps, somewhat greater ; but there is not a night in the year that a blanket is not found very com- fortable. Before ten o'clock in the morning the heat is greatest ; at that hour a breeze generally springs up from the mountains, and renders the air agreeable the whole day. Fever and ague are disorders unknown here, and persons who come hither afflicted with them from the low country, get rid of them in a very short time. Except in the\u00bb neighbourhood of stagnant waters, Virginia has, opon the whole, a healthy climate. The soil in the low part of the state is sandy, except on the banks of the rivers, where it is very rich. Between the head of tide-waters and tbe mountains, it exhibits a great variety, and a considerable portiou is good. Among the mountains there is a great deal of poor land, but it is interspersed with rich valleys; at the South-west moun- tains in particular, which are the first you come to in travelling from the sea-coast, the soil is a deep clayey earth, well suited to the culture of small grain and clover, and produces abundant crops. Beyond the mountains the soil is generally rich and fertile. The face of the country is somewhat similar to Penn sylvania, Jersey, Delaware, and Maryland. The eastern part extends along the sea-coast about 115 miles, of which the mouth of Chesapeak bay occupies twelve ; and this grand confluence of waters forms a great variety in this part of the state. From the sea-coast to the head of the NO. XX. 3 N"], [482, "460 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. tide-waters, about 100 miles, the country is mostly level, abounding with swamps; and seems from various appear ances, to have been once washed by the sea. The land between York and James rivers is very level, and its sur face about forty feet above high water mark. It appears from observation to have arisen to its present height at different periods far distant from each other, and that at these periods it was occasionally covered by the sea ; sor near Yorktown, where the banks are perpendicular, yon first see a stratum, intermixed with small shells, resem bling a mixture of clay and sand, about five feet thick ; on this lies horizontally, a layer of small white shells, such as cockle, clam, &c. an inch or two thick ; then a body of earth similar to that first mentioned, eighteen inches in depth ; then a layer of shells and another body of earth ; on this a mass, three feet thick, of white shells mixed with sand, on which lies a body of oj _ter shells six feet thick, which are covered with earth to the surface. The oyster shells are so firmly united by a strong cement, that they fall only when undermined, and then in large bodies from one to twenty tons weight. Beyond the mountains the country is much variegated, here swelling out into considerable hills, there subsiding into agreeable valleys, and so continues to the Ohio, about sixty miles. The great mass of the population in Virginia are farm ers, or, as they are termed there, planters. Before the revolution these planters paid their principal attention to ihe culture of tobacco, of which there used to be export ed nearly -60,000 hogsheads a year. Since that period, they have turned their attention more to the cultivation of wheat, Indian corn, barley, flax, and hemp. Consider able quantifies of cotton are raised in the southern parts of the state ; indigo is also cultivated with success, and the silk-worm is a native of the country, thougb not much attended to. The fields likewise produce potatoes, both sweet and common, turnips, carrots, parsnips, pump kins, and ground nuts ; and of grasses, there are clovers, red, white, and yellow, timothy, ray, greensward, blue grass, and crab grass. The orchards abound in fruits, apples, pears, peaches, quinces, cherries, nectarines, apricots, almonds, and plums. The domestic animals thrive well, and there is a great variety of wild game. Horned or neat cattle are bred in great numbers in the western counties, where they have an extensive range and mild winters, without any perma- nent snows. They run at large, are not housed, and multiply very fast. Great pains have been taken by ths"], [483, "461 STATE OF VIRGINIA. citizens of Virginia to raise a good breed of horses, and they have succeeded in it beyond any of the states. Horse racing has had a great tendency to encourage the breeding of superior horses, as it affords an opportunity of putting them to the trial of their speed. They are more elegant, and will perform more service, than the horses of the northern states. Virginia is thought to contain more mineral productions than any other state in the Union. A single lump of gold ore has been found near Rappahannock river, which rises near the Blue mountains, that produced seventeen penny weights of pure gold ; but no other indications of gold has been discovered in its neighbourhood. On the Great Kauhaway, and in the county of Montgomery, lead mines have been long worked ; aud in some other parts of the state, lead ore has likewise been found. The metal is mixed sometimes with earth, and sometimes with rock, which requires the force of gunpowder to open it. The proportion yielded is from fifty to eighty lb. of pure metal from 100 lb. of washed ore. Copper, iron, black lead, marble, limestone, &c. are found in the state. Crystals are common ; and some amethysts and one emerald have been discovered. Among the mountains there are eaves, which yield saltpetre in such abundance, that 500,000 lb. of it might be collected from them annually. In many parts of this state, particularly at Richmond, and among the mountains, abundance of coal may be had for digging; but little value will be attached to it while wood continues in such plenty. In Brooke county, upon the Ohio, she hills are composed of coal, in like mannerasat Pittsburgh; and in most of the western counties, coal may- be- raised in great plenty. Civil divisions, towns, population, religion, and cha racter. \u2014 Virginia is divided into an eastern and western district, and ninety-seven counties; but not subdivided into townships, nor are there any towns of consequence ; owing probably to the country being so chequered with navigable rivers, that a market is brought almost to every man's door, and they have no inducements to establish large towns. By the last general census the number of white inhabitants in this state was 582,104, exclusive of 392,518 slaves, in all 974,622 ; but according to the return of 1817, the population amounts to 1,347,496, of whom 85,758 are enrolled in the militia,"], [484, "462 UNITED STATES OF A.MERICA.

The state-house stands on an eminence, and is considered a handsome edifice ; it has spacious apartments for the meeting of the legislature, and commodious rooms for the transaction of the public business of the state. The other public buildings are a court-house, jail, and theatre, two places for worship, a freemason's hall, and three tobacco warehouses. This city is remarkably well situated for mill-seats ; some of the finest flour-mills in the state have been erected here, and the quantity of flour manufac- tured annually is immense. There are also rolling and slitting-mills, oil-mills, and many others ; and several ex tensive distilleries and breweries. Richmond carries on a considerable trade, principally in tobacco and flour, with many parts of the United States, particularly New York, which in return supplies it with dry goods and groceries. In this town the price of every thing isexorbitant beyond example; eggs, 2\\d. a piece; butter, 3_.

Norfolk, the largest and most commercial town in Virginia, is situated on the east side of Elizabeth river, on wbich there is a safe and commodious harbour, capable of containing 300 sail of ships. This town was burned down on the first of September, 1776, by the Liverpool man of war, by order ofthe British governor, lord Dunmore, and the loss amounted to \u00a3300,000 sterling. At present it is a place of very extended commerce, carrying on a brisk trade with the West Indies, Europe, and the different states. Here are two churches, one for episcopalians, the other for methodists, a court-house, a theatre, and an academy. There are at Norfolk large deposits of timber for the use of the navy; a line of battle ship is now on the stocks, and the frames of another of the same class, and a frigate, were collected in the summer of 1818. Petersburgh, twenty-five miles from Richmond, is the only town of consequence south of James river, between Norfolk aud Richmond. It stands upon the south side of Appamatox river, and is a place of considerable wealth and importance, carrying on a great trade in tobacco and flour, a considerable portion of which is with New York. This town was almost entirely burnt down about four years ago ; but it has been since rebuilt in a very handsome manner. Immense quantities of flour are manufactured at the mills in Petersburgh, and within 100 yards of it, to which may be added that made at the country mills ; the whole of which is exported from this place, to the amount of at least 60,000 barrels yearly : nearly 3,000 hogsheads of tobacco are inspected annually at the warehouses. To these exports may be added peach and apple brandy, whisky, &c. The population of this town is said to be composed principally of Irish people, and they are distinguished for frank liberal manners, and high-spirited patriotism. Fredericksburgh is situated on the south-west side of Rappahannock river, about ninety miles from its mouth in Chesapeak bay. It is regularly laid out, the streets crossing each other at right angles, and contains above 300 houses, three tobacco warehouses, and many stores of well-assorted goods. The principal public buildings are an episcopal church, an academy, court-house, and jail. It is a place of considerable trade, chiefly flour and tobacco. Yorktown is agreeably situated on the south side of York river, opposite to Gloucester, and a mile distant."], [488, "466 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. It contains about 100 houses, an episcopal church, a jail, and a tobacco warehouse ;and will ever be famous in the American annals for the capture of lord Cornwallis and his whole army by the combined forces of the United States and France, on the 19th of October, 1781. During the mi litary operations every tree near the place was destroyed, and the houses in the town still bear evident marks of the seige, and the inhabitants will not, on any account, suffer the holes made by the cannon balls to be repaired on the outside. The other towns, or rather villages, in this state, are of so little importance either in trade or manufactures, as to render a particular description of them unnecessary. The names of the following may be added, as they are all situ ated upon those rivers which contribute their waters to Chesapeak bay: on Rappahannock, Urbanna, Port-royal, and Falmouth. \u2014 On Potomac and its waters, Dumfries, Colchester, Winchester, and Staunton. \u2014 On York river and its waters, Newcastle and Hanover. \u2014 On James river and its waters, Portsmouth, Hampton, Suffolk, Smithfield, Williamsburgh, Manchester, Charlottesville, and New London. There is no town of any great consequence in tbe western parts of the state. Lexington, the capital of Roekbridge county, and Charleston, in Brooke county, are likely to improve considerably ; but Wheeling, on the river Ohio, will probably, for the reasons already assigned, increase more than any other town in that quarter. The religion of Virginia has undergone nearly as great a revolution, as the government. The first settlers were from England, and members of the English church, just tit the period when it had obtained a complete victory over all other religious opinions, No sooner did these new colonists become possessed of power, than they began to display a spirit of intolerance against all other sects, nothing inferior to that shewn by the puritans who had emigrates! to Massachusetts. Laws were passed to pro hibit the quakers from assembling, and to punish any master of a ship who might bring a quaker into the coun try. Such as had arrived were imprisoned until they should abjure the state ; for a second attempt to come into the colony a greater punishment was to be inflicted, and for a third, death ! This persecuting spirit flourished in full enormity sor about a century, when milder opinions began to creep in, and continued to increase until the commencement of the revolution, at Which period about two-thirds of the people had become dissenters. The present denominations of Christians in Virginia"], [489, "467 STATE OF VIRGINIA. are, presbyterians, who are by far the most numerous, and inhabit the western parts of the state ; episcopalians, who are the most ancient settlers, and occupy the eastern and first settled parts : intermixed with these are great num bers of methodists and baptists. The bulk of these reli gious sects are of the poorer sort of people, and many of them are very ignorant; but they are generally well meaning and moral in their conduct. They exhibit much zeal in their worship, which appears to be composed ofthe mingled effusions of piety, enthusiasm, and superstition. Education was long neglected in this state, but of late years the subject has been taken up with that laudable spirit of decision, which promises to be attended with the most beneficial consequences. There are two colleges ia the state, one at Williamsburgh, founded by kiug William and queen Mary, capable of containing 100 students ; the other at Lexington, called Washington college, hand somely eudowed by the distinguished man whose name it bears, for the support and education of fifty students. There are several academies, and schools in each county ; and there are numerous teachers in private families, as tutors. The means, in short, for educating the wealthy are abundant, and extensively applied ; but the system seems to be still defective, so far as the great mass of the people are concerned. The character of the Virginians differs very much in different parts of the state. In the lower parts, they are celebrated for their politeness and hospitality to strangers; beyond the mountains, where three-fourths of the people are Germans or their descendants, the manners of the in habitants are totally dissimilar. In the neighbourhood of the South mountains, which are the first you approach when proceeding from the low country, the common people are of a more frank and open disposition, more inclined to hospitality, and seem to live more contentedly on what they possess, than those of the same class-in any other part of the state ; but from being able to procure the necessaries of life upon very easy terms, they are rather of an indolent habit, and inclined to dissipation. Through out Virginia, the climate and external appearance of the country conspire to make the people careless, easy, and good-natured ; extremly fond of society, and much at tached to convivial pleasures, and also to gaming ; in con sequence of this, they seldom shew auy spirit of enter prise, or expose themselves willingly to fatigue. Their authority over their slaves renders them vain and impe rious, and entire strangers to that elegance of sentiment, 3o"], [490, "468 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. which so peculiarly distinguish refined and polished nations. Notwithstanding which, a spirit of liberality is eminently conspicuous both in their private and public character ; they never deny assistance to the distressed, nor refuse any necessary supplies for the support of government when called upon, and are, upou the whole, a friendly, generous, and loyal people. Trade, manufactures, agriculture, &c. \u2014 The principal articles exported from this state, besides flour and tobacco, are Indian corn, masts, planks, staves, &c. tar, pitch and turpentine, skins of deer, foxes, beavers, &c. pork, flax seed, hemp, cotton, pit-coal, pig iron, peas, beef, fish, brandy, whisky, and horses. The yearly amount of ex ports, previous to the revolution, averaged 2,833,333 dol lars, or \u00a3637,500 sterling. In the year 1791, the amount was 3,131,227 dollars ; in 1792, 3,549,499 ; in 1793, 2,984,317; in 1794, 3,321,494; in 1796, 5,268,615 ; in 1797, 4,908,713 ; in 1801, 4,660,361 ; and in 1817, 5,621,442 dollars ; of which only 60,204 was foreign produce. But as a great part of the trade of Virginia is carried on through the medium of other states, particularly New York, and as none of the produce sent to those states are included in the custom-house returns, it is very probable that the domestic produce for the year 1817 was nearly double the amount given above, and the imports, principally manu factured goods, almost as much, of which at least one half are British. The manufactures of this state are mostly ofthe domes tic kind ; nor is there any established upon an extensive seale : hence the quantity imported annually from Great Britain must be immense. The principal planters have nearly every thing they want upon their own estates ; amongst their slaves are found weavers, tanners, smiths, shoemakers, cotton and woollen spinners, taylors, carpen ters, turners, wheelwrights, &c. &c. Excellent coarse woollen cloth is made by those slaves, and a variety of cotton goods ; among the rest very handsome nankeen ; and it is not uncommon to see a frugal and wealthy farmer or planter, manufacture every article under his own roof, of linen, woollen, and cotton, sufficient for the consump tion of his own large household. Agriculture is nearly on the same footing as in Mary land ; but perhaps in a more progressive state of improve ment. In many parts of the state the culture of tobacco is rapidly giving way to the much more important articl."], [491, "469 STATE OF VIRGINIA. of wheat ; but this happy change in the system is greatly retarded in the low country, particularly between the Potomac and Rappahannock rivers, by immense quantities of land being held by a few individuals, who derive large incomes from them, whilst the generality of the people are but in a state of mediocrity. But this disparity among the inhabitants is happily decreasing every year ; many of the large estates Jiaviug been divided in consequence of the removal of the proprietors to more healthy parts of the country, and many more ou account of the salutary laws of Virginia, which do not permit any one son to inherit the landed estates of his father, to the exclusion of his brothers. The large plantations in this part of the country are entirely managed by stewards and overseers, the proprie- tors just amusing themselves with seeing what is going forward. The work is done wholly by slaves, whose num- bers are more than double that of the white persons. In general the slaves are very well provided for, and treated with mildness ; especially those belonging to wealthy planters. Adjoining their little habitations they com- monly have small gardens and yards for poultry, which are their own property ; they have ample time to attend to their own concerns, aud their gardens are generally neat and well stocked, and their flocks of poultry nume- rous. Besides the food they raise for themselves, they are allowed liberal portions of pork, Indian flour, &c. Many of their huts are comfortably furnished, and they are themselves, in general, extremely well clothed, ln short, their condition is by no means so wretched as might be imagined. They are obliged to work certain hours in the day ; but in return they are well dressed, dieted, and lodged comfortably, and saved all anxiety about provision for their offspring. Still, however, they are slaves ; and as long as they hear people around them talking of the blessings of liberty, it is not to be supposed that they can feel equally happy with freemen. Many large tracts of land in the low country are totally exhausted, by the ruinous system of working the same piece of ground year after year, till it is entirely worn out. The planters now see the absurdity of this system, and raise only one crop of tobacco upon a piece of new land, then they sow wheat for two years, and afterwards clover. They lay from 12 to 1,500 bushels of manure on each acre at first, which is found to be sufficient both for the tobacco and wheat : the latter is produced at the rate of, twenty-five bushels an acre."], [492, "470 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. Betwixt Elizabeth river and North Carolina lies Great Dismal swamp, an immense bog thirty miles in lepgth and ten in breadth, and containing 150,000 acres: It is entirely covered with trees of an enormous size, and be tween them such a mass of brush-wood, that in many places the swamp is impenetrable. The whole tract is the property of two companies, viz. the Virginia and North Carolina ; 100,000 acres belonging to the former, and 50,000 to the latter. This swamp is of great value to the proprietors, partly from the excellent grazing which it affords to great numbers of cattle, and partly for the amazing quantity of staves, shingles, &c. that are made from the trees growing in it, and for which the canal now cutting through the swamp will afford a ready conveyance to Norfolk, from whence they are exported. From the Great Dismal to Richmond, a distance of 140 miles, along the south side of James river, the country is flat and sandy and for many miles together entirely cover ed with pine trees. In Nansemond county, bordering on the swamp, the soil is so poor that very little grain is raised ; but it answers well for peach orchards, which here, and in many other parts of the state, are found to be very profitable. From the peaches an excellent brandy is made, which is greatly esteemed, and often highly im proved by putting dried pears into it. Spirits and water is the universal beverage throughout Virginia. The plant ers also make large quantities of tar and pitch from the pine trees ; for which there is always a ready market. The neighbourhood of the mountains is much more populous than that wliich lies towards Richmond. All the productions of the lower parts of Virginia may be had here, at the same time, the heat is never found so oppressive. On the eastern side of the ridge, cotton grows extremely well; and in winter the snow scarcely ever remains more than a day or two upon the ground. On the other side, cotton never comes to perfection ; the winters are severe, and the fields covered with snow for weeks together. The country immediately behind the Blue ridge, between Bottefourt county and the Potomac river, abounds with extensive tracts of rich land ; and the low grounds bordering upon Shenandoah river, which runs contiguous to the Blue ridge for upwards of 100 miles, are in particular distinguished for their fertility. Wheat produces as plentiful crops as in any part of the United States, and clover grows most luxuriantly. To bacco is not raised except for private use, and but little Indian corn is sown, as it is liable to be injured by th."], [493, "471 STATE OF VIRGINIA. nightly frosts, which are common in the spring. The cultivated lauds in this part of the country are mostly parcelled out in small portions ; there are no persons here, as on the other side of the mountains, possessing large farms. Poverty is as much unknown here as great wealth; each man owns the house he lives in and the land which he cultivates, aud every one appears to be in a happy state of mediocrity, and unambitious of a more elevated situation than what he himself enjoys. The free inhabitants consist sor the most part of Germans, who here maintain the same character as in Pennsylvania and the other states where they have settled. About one sixth of the people, on an average, are slaves; but in some ofthe counties the proportion is much less : in Rock bridge the slaves do not amount to more than a ninth, and in Shenandoah county not to a twentieth part of the whole. Constitution \u2014 The executive powers are lodged in the hands of a governor, chosen annually, and incapable of acting more than three years in seven ; he is assisted by a council of eight members. The judiciary powers are divided among several courts. Legislation is exercised by two houses of assembly, the one called the House of Delegates, composed of two members from each county, chosen annually, by the citizens possessing an estate for life of 100 acres of uninhabited land, or twenty-five acres with a house and lot on it, or a house and lot in some town. The other, called the Senate, consisting of twenty four members, chosen every fourth year, by the same electors, who, for this purpose, are distributed into twenty four districts. The concurrence of both houses is neces sary to the passing of a law. They have the appointment of the governor and council, the judges of the superior courts, auditors, attorney-general, treasurer, and delegates to the congress of the United States. The constitution of Virginia was settled early in the revolutionary war, and is one of the most defective and objectionable of the American governments. History. \u2014 A brief historical account of the first settle ment of Virginia, till the arrival of lord De la War, iu 1610, has already been given. His arrival with a fresh supply of settlers and provisions, revived the drooping spirits of the former company, and gave permanency an 4 respectability to the young colony."], [494, "472 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. In April, 1613, Mr. John Rolfe, a worthy young gentle man, was married to Pocahontas, the daughter of Pow hatan, the famous Indian chief. This connection, which was very agreeable both to the English and Indians, was the foundation of a friendly aud advantageous commerce between them. In 1616, the culture of tobacco had become general in this colony. In this year, Mr. Rolfe, with his wife Poca- hontas, visited England, where she was treated with that attention and respect which she had merited by her im- portant services to the colony in Virginia. She died the year following at Gravesend, in the 2'iii year of her age, just as she was about to embark for America. She had embraced the Christian religion ; and in her life and death evinced the sincerity of her profession. She left a little son, who, having received his education in England, went over to Virginia, where he lived and died in affluence and honour, leaving behind him an only daughter. Her de- scendants are amoug the most respectable families in Virginia. In 1721, the London company, who had obtained a royal charter for establishing a colony in Virginia, by charter under their common seal, appointed two supreme councils in the colony; one, the council of state, was to assist the governor ; the other to be called the General Assembly, and to be composed of the council of state, and two burgesses out of every district, to be chosen by the inhabitants. This assembly had the power to make laws for t'x _ public good, and for the government of the colony; but were to adhere as closely as possible to the laws of England. All measures were to be decided by a majority of votes, and the governor to have a negative ; but no law could have authoirity until ratified by the company in England. The king and the company soon quarrelled, by which the latter were stripped of all their rights, without the smallest retribution, after having ex pended \u00a3100,000 iu establishing the colony, without the least assistance from government. In 1624, king James I. suspended the powers ofthe company, and the year following, Charles I. took the government of the colony into his own hands ; the colo nists, however, took very little interest in the dispute be tween the king and the company, while their own rights were not infringed upon. In 1650, the parliament, having deposed the king, be gan to assume an authority without as well as within th. realm, and passed a law prohibiting the trade of the colo-"], [495, "STATE OF VIRGINIA. 473 nists with foreign nations. This law gave the fatal pre cedent to future parliaments, which was unfortunately continued afterwards under different reigns, until by that means a total separation was at length produced between all the American colonies and the mother country. When this colony, which still maintained its opposition to Cromwell, was iuduced, in 1651, to lay down their arms, they previously secured their most essential rights by a solemn convention. This convention, entered into with arms in their hands, they supposed had secured the ancient limits of their country, its free trade, its exemp tion from taxation, except by their own assembly, and exclusion of military force from among them ; yet in every one of these points was this convention violated by subsequent kings and parliaments. But without entering into a detail of the different injuries received at former times, specimens of them all can be found in the short space of fifteen years, commencing with the year 1760. The colonies were taxed internally and externally ; their essential rights sacrificed to individuals in Great Britain ; their legislatures suspended ; charters annulled ; trial by jury taken away ; their persons subjected to transporta tion beyond the Atlantic, and to trial before a foreign judicature ; their supplications for redress thought beneath answer ; tbemselves published as cowards in the councils of their mother countrjT, and courts of Europe ; armed troops sent among them to enforce submission to these violences ; and actual hostilities commenced against them. No alternative was presented but resistance, or uncon ditional submission. Between these could be no hesita tion. They closed in the appeal to arms. They declared themselves independent states ; and they confederated together into one great republic ; thus securing to every state the benefit of an union of their whole force. \u2014 Virgi nia has the honour of having produced some of the most distinguished and influential men, who were active in effecting the graud revolution which has established the independence of their country."], [496, "474 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA* Situation, Boundaries, and Extent. North Carolina is situated between 33\u00b0 45' and 36\u00b0 30' N. lat. and 1\u00b0 E. and 6\u00b0 50' W. long. It is bounded on the north by Virginia ; south, by South Carolina and Georgia; east, by the Atlantic ocean ; aud west, by Tennessee. From east to west, it is about 345 miles in length, and from north to south, 120 miles in breadth ; forming an area of 45,000 square miles, or 28,800,000 acres. Rivers, sounds, capes, &c. \u2014 Cape Fear river is the most considerable stream in North Carolina. After a course of 200 miles, it falls into the sea at Cape Fear, where it is three miles wide, in about latitude 30\u00b0 45'. As you ascend it, you pass Brunswick on the left, and Wilmington for large vessels, for sloops twenty-five miles higher up, and for boats to Fayettsville, near ninety miles farther. The Roanoke is a long and rapid river, formed by the Staunton, which rises in Virginia, and the Dan, which has its source in North Carolina. The low lands on this river are subject to inundations ; but they are nevertheless very rich, and the planters living on its banks are the wealthiest in tbe state. It is navigable for sea vessels only about thirty miles, and for boats of thirty tons to the falls, seventy miles from its mouth ; above the falls, boats of five tons may ascend about 200 miles. It empties by several mouths into the south-west end of Albemarle sound. Neuse river rises in Orange county, in this state, and after a very winding course of above 500 miles, falls into Pamlico sound, seventy miles below Newbern, at which town it is a mile and a half wide, expanding at its mouth, where it is nine miles wide. It is navigable for sea vessels twelve miles above Newbern, for small sloops fifty, and for boats 200 miles. Pamlico or Tar river is a considerable stream which falls into Pamlico sound, after a south-east course of about 160 miles, in which it passes Washington, Tarborough, aud Greenville. It is navigable for vessels drawing nine feet water to Washington, forty miles from its mouth, and for scows carrying thirty or forty hogsheads, fifty miles farther to the town of Tarborough."], [497, "STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA. 475 Chowan river is formed by the confluence of three rivers, viz. the Mebirren, Nottaway, and Black river ; all of which rise in Virginia. It falls into the north-west cor ner of Albemarle sound, and is three miles wide at its mouth, but narmws fast as you ascend it. Cushai is a small river wbich also falls into the same sound, between Chowan and Roanoke. There are several other rivers of less note, among which are the Pasquetank, Perqnemins, Little river, Alligator, &c. which discharge themselves into Albemarle sound. All the rivers in North Carolina, and, it may be added, in South Carolina, Georgia, and the Floridas, which empty into the Atlantic ocean, are navigable by any vessel that can pass the bar at their mouths. Pamlico sound is a kind of a lake or inland sea, from ten to twenty miles broad, and nearly 100 miles in length. It is separated from the Atlantic ocean, in its whole length, by a beach of sand hardly a mite wide, generally covered with small trees or bushes. Through this bank are several small inlets, by which boats may pass ; but Oerecock inlet is the only one that will admit vessels of burden into the districts of Edenton and Newbern, This inlet is in lat. 35\u00b0 10' N. and communicates with Albemarle sound, which is also a kind of inland sea, sixty miles in length, and from eight to twelve in breadth, lying north of Pamlico sound. Core sound lies south of Pamlico, and has a communication with it. These sounds are so large, when compared with their inlets from the sea, that no tide can be perceived in any of the rivers which empty into them, nor is the water salt, even in the mouths of these rivers. Cape Hatteras, the most remarkable and dangerous cape on the coast of North America, is situated in lat. 35\u00b0 15', and has occasioned the destruction of many a fine vessel, and the loss of hundreds of valuable lives. The water is very shoal at a great distance from the cape, which is re markable for sudden and violent squalls of wind, and for the most severe storms of thunder, lightning, and rain, which happen almost every day for one half the year. The shoals lie about fourteen miles south-west of the cape, and are nearly sive or six acres in extent, with about ten feet water. Here, at times, the oceau breaks in a tremen dous manner, spouting as it were to the clouds, from the violent agitation of the Gulf stream, which touches the edge of the banks. Cape Lookout lies north-east of Cape Fear, and south of Cape Hatteras, opposite to Core sound ; its north point 3p"], [498, "476 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. forming the south side of Ocrecock inlet, which leads fo Pamlico sound. It once had an excellent harbour, wbich has been filled up with sand since the year 1777. Cape Fear is remarkable for a dangerous shoal, called, from its form, the Frying-pan. This shoal lies at the entrance of Cape Fear river. Face of the country, climate, soil, and production. \u2014 The face of the country is very greatly diversified. To the east and south-east, there is a sea-coast of nearly 300 miles, indented with a great number of bays or sounds, the principal of which have been already described. The whole country below the head of tide-water, nearly 100 miles into the interior, is low and sandy, abounding in swamps, and presents an evident appearance of having been at one period overflowed by the sea. In all this flat open district, marine productions are found by digging about twenty feet below the surface of the ground. A great proportion of this tract lies in forest, and is entirely barren. On the banks of some of the rivers, particularly the Roanoke, the land is fertile and good. Interspersed through the other parts are many openings of rich swamp, and ridges of oak land, ofa fine fertile soil. The country from the head of tide-waters, towards the mountains, is agreeably uneven, and much improved in value. Pro ceeding still farther in that direction, it rises into hills and mountains, and amongst them the seasons are delight ful. There are two remarkable swamps in this state ; one on the line which separates it from Virginia ; for a part of the Great Dismal, already described, lies in North Carolina ; and the other in Currituck county, containing 350,000 acres, supposed to contain one of the most valu able rice estates in America. In the midst of this swamp is a lake eleven miles long and seven broad, the waters of which is connected with Skuppernong river by a navi gable canal. The climate in the low country is subject to great and sudden changes, and is often unhealthy in the fall : gene rally the winters are mild, but very changeable, and the spring is early, but liable to occasional frosts. The sum mers are hot and sultry, and the autumns are serene and beautiful ; but the exhalations from the decaying vegetable matter in the marshes and swamps are very injurious to health. In those seasons, the inhabitants are subject to intermittent fevers, which often prove fatal ; particularly in the flat country near tbe sea coast. In the upper"], [499, "477 STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA. country, the weather is more settled, and, being free from swTamps, is healthy and agreeable. Among the mountains, the climate is remarkably pleasant. The soil of North Carolina is very little different from that of Virginia. The low part of the state, which isa considerable portion of it, is sandy and barren, abounding in pine trees; and the swamps, which are very large, pro- duce bay trees and cedars. On the contrary, in the moun- tainous parts the soil is perpetually moist, and very fertile. This is demonstrated by the vegetable strength of the trees; among which are the red and black oak, the sugar maple, the ash, and particularly the chesnut, which grows to a prodigious height. The sides of these mountains facing the north is sometimes covered exclusively with the calico tree, from twelve to fifteen feet high. They frequently occupy spaces of 300 acres, which at a distance appear like a charming meadow. It is well known that this shrub excels every other in point of blossom. In the great woods the surface of the soil is covered with a species of wild peas, that rises about three feet from the earth, and serves as excellent fodder for the cattle. They prefer this pasturage to any other, and whenever they are driven from it they pine away, or make their escape to get to it again. These mountains begin to be populated rapidly. The salubrity of the air, the ex- cellence of the water, and more especially the pasturage of these wild peas for the cattle, are so many causes that induce new inhabitants to settle here. Estates of the first class are sold at from two to five dollars an acre, and the whole of the taxes do not amount to a penny an acre more. Indian corn, wheat, rye, oats, and peach trees, are the sole objects of culture. ln the other parts of the state, not of a swampy nature, the soil in general is very indifferent ; the woods are in a great measure composed of various kinds of oaks, the surface of the ground is covered with a coarse 'grass, intermixed with plants, and the plantations straggling five or six miles from each other, present a dreary and uncomfortable appearance. Civil divisions, towns, population, religion, and cha racter. \u2014 North Carolina is divided into eight districts and sixty-two counties, containing by the last general census 555,000 inhabitants, including 168,824 slaves; but by the returns of the stale census, in 1817, the population amounts to 701,224, of whom 50,387 are enrolled in the militia. The districts are classed in three, divisions, viz."], [500, "478 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. the eastern districts, Edenton, Newbern, aud Wilmington ; the middle districts, Fayetteville, Hillsborough, and Halifax ; and the western districts, Morgan and Salisbury. the names of the counties are as follow : Population.

Sixty-two. 555,500 Raleigh, the seat of government of North Carolina, is situated in N. lat. 35\u00b0 56', and is nearly in the centre of the state, being 160 miles from the sea-coast. In 1791 the legislature appropriated \u00a310,000 towards erecting the public buildings, and named the town after sir Walter Raleigh, under whose direction the first settlement in America was made. The state-house, a large handsome building, cost \u00a36,000 ; but there are no other public build- ings of importance, and a great part of the houses being of wood, the place exhibits no very flattering appearance. The plan is regular, the streets intersecting each other at right angles ; but the remoteness of the town from navi- gation is a great disadvantage. Raleigh is 287 miles from Washington, 164 from Richmond, 388 from Milledgeville, the capital of Georgia, and 932 from New Orleans. Wilmington, the chief town of Wilmington district, is situated on the east side of Cape Fear or Clarendon river, thirty-four miles from the sea and 100 southward of New- bern. The town is regularly built, and contains about 2,000 inhabitants, of whom nearly 1,000 are in slavery."], [502, "480 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. The public buildings are a handsome episcopal church, a court-house, and a jail. Thc markets are well supplied with fish and all manner of provisions; and there is a con siderable trade carried on to the West Indies and the adjacent states. This town has suffered severely from fire at various times. Newbern is situated at the confluence of the Neuse and Trent rivers, on a level point of land, somewhat resem bling Charleston, South Carolina, and carries on a brisk trade with other places in the state, aud with the West Indies. This is the largest town in the state, containing about 600 houses, mostly built of wood, except the palace, the church, the jail, and a few dwelling-houses, which are of brick. The palace was erected by the province before the revolution, and was formerly the residence of the governors. It is large and elegant, but much out of repair, and the only use to which this once handsome and well furnished building is now applied, is for schools. One of the halls is used for a school, aud another for a dancing room. The arms ofthe king of Great Britain still appear on a pediment in front ofthe building. The episcopalian church is the only house for public worship in the place. This town carries on a considerable trade to the West Indies and the different states in tar, pitch, turpentine, lumber, corn, &e. Hillsborough, the chief town of Hillsborough district, is situated in a high, healthy, and fertile country, 180 miles north-west of Newbern. It contains about 100 dwelling houses, a court-house, jail, and an academy, in which are educated sixty or seventy students. Edenton, ou Albemarle sound, is one of the oldest towns in the state, and was formerly the seat of the royal governors. The public buildings are an ancient brick episcopal church, a court-house, and jail. Its situation is advantageous for trade, but unhealthy ; which has doubt less tended to retard its prosperity. The other towns of most note are Tarborough and Washington on the Tar river, Halifax on the Roanoke, Salem on the Yadkin, and Beauford near Cape Lookout. The population of these places is about from 400 to 800 ; and there are many villages containing from 100 to 300. The western parts of this state, which have been settled within the last sixty years, are chiefly inhabited by pres byterians from Pennsylvania, the descendants of people from the north of Ireland, who are greatly attached to the doctrines, discipline and usages of the church of Scotland : they are a regular and industrious people."], [503, "STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA; 481 The Moravians have several flourishing settlements iu the upper parts of the state. The friends or quakers have a settlement in New Garden, iu Gnilsord county, and several congregations at Perquimans and Pasquotank. The methodists and baptists are numerous and increasing. In 1789, the legislature passed a law incorporating forty gentlemen, five from each district, as trustees of the university of North Carolina ; and the state has made handsome donations for the endowment of this seminary. There is a very good academy at Warrenton, another at Williamsburgh, and four or five more in the state, of con siderable note. The state of society is somewhat similar to Virginia, and notwithstanding the establishment of a college and academies, the most important branch of education, that which has for its object the general diffusion of know ledge, has been shamefully neglected until of late. In 1808, however, an act passed the legislature to establish common schools throughout the state, which, if properly followed up, will be attended with the happiest effects. The inhabitants are mostly farmers, and produce on their farms every necessary of life in abundance : many of them are wealthy, frank, and hospitable. The principal com modities for sale are tar, turpentiue, pitch, rosin, timber, bees-wax, corn, cotton, and tobacco. Almost every family in the country manufacture their own clothing, so that the British trade to this state is not great, nor im portant. The greater part of it is carried on through the medium of Charleston, South Carolina, or the northern states. The direct exports, in 1805, amounted to 779,903 dollars; in 1817, to 956,580 dollars, of which only 1,369 was foreign produce. Constitution. \u2014 By the constitution of this state, which was ratified in 1776, the legislative authority is vested in a senate and house of commons, both dependent on the people, and styled the General Assembly. The senate is composed of representatives, one for each county, chosen annually by ballot. The house of commons consists of representatives chosen in the same manner, two for each county, and one for each of the towns of Edenton, New bern, Wilmington, Salisbury, Hillsborough, and Halifax. Senators must be possessed of 300 acres of land, repre sentatives of 100. In this state, freeholders of fifty acres vote for members of the senate ; all freemen ofthe age of twenty-one years, who have been inhabitants of the county"], [504, "482 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. in which they dwell twelve months before the election, and have paid public taxes, vote for the members of the house of commons for that county ; and all free male in habitants of towns under the same conditions, and every holder of a freehold in the above-named towns votes for the members for those places. The executive power is vested in a governor, who is chosen by ballot by the Gene ral Assembly ; for one year only ; and he is not eligible to serve more than three years in six successive years. He is assisted by a council of state, consisting of seven per sons, also elected by the two houses of legislature an nually. The judiciary consists of a supreme court, a court of equity, and a court of admiralty: the judges are appointed by the assembly. Persons denying the being of a God, the truth of the protestant religion, or the divine authority of the Old and New Testament, receivers of public money, whose accounts are unsettled, and mili tary officers in actual service, are all ineligible to a seat either in the senate or house of commons. Justices ofthe peace, being recommended by the representatives, are commissioned by the governor, and hold their offices during good behaviour. The constitution allows of no religious establishment. A majority of both houses is necessary to do business. History. \u2014 The history of North Carolina is less known than that of any of the other states. From the best ac counts that can be procured, the first permanent settle ment in North Carolina was made about the year 1710, by a number of Germans, who had been reduced to great indigence, by a calamitous war. The proprietors of Carolina, knowing that the value of their lands depended on the strength of their settlements, determined to give every possible encouragement to such emigrants. Ships were accordingly provided for their transportation, and instructions were given to governor Tynte to allow 100 acres of land for every man, woman, and child, free of quit-rents for the first ten years ; but at the expiration of that term, to pay one penny an acre annual rent for ever. Upon tbeir arrival, the governor granted them a tract of land in North Carolina, since called Albemarle and Bath precincts, where they settled, and flattered themselves with having found, in the hideous wilderness, a happy retreat from the desolations of a war which then raged in Europe. Iu the year 1712, a dangerous conspiracy was formed"], [505, "483 STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA. by the Coree and Tuscorora tribes of Iudians, to murder and expel this infant colony : the foundation for this con spiracy is not known. Probably they were offended at the encroachments on their hunting grounds ; but be that as it may, they managed their couspiracy with great cun ning and profound secrecy. They began by surrounding their principal town with a breastwork, to secure their fami lies. Here the warriors assembled to the number of 1,200, and from this rendezvous they sent out small parties, by different roads, who entered the settlement under the mask of friendship. At the change of the full moon, all of them had agreed to begin their murderous operation on the same night; aud when that night eame, they enter ed the houses of the planters, demanded provisions, and pretending to be offended, fell to murdering men, women, and children, without mercy or distinction. No less than 137 settlers, among whom were a Swiss nobleman, and almost all the poor Germans that had lately come iuto the country, were slaughtered the first night. Such was the secrecy and despatch of the Indians in this expedition,. that none knew what had befallen his neighbour, until the savages had reached his own door. Some few, how ever, escaped and gave the alarm ; the militia immediately assembled in arms, and kept watch day and night, until the news of the sad disaster had reached South Carolina. Governor Craven lost no time in sending a force to their relief; and the assembly voted \u00a34,000 for the service of the war. A body of 600 militia, under the command of colonel Barnwell, and 366 Indians of different tribes, marched with great expedition, through a horrid wilder ness, to their assistance. In their first encounter with the Indians, they killed 300 and took 100 prisoners: after this defeat, the Tuscororas retreated to their fortified town, which was shortly after surrendered to colonel Barnwell. In this whole expedition it was computed that near 1,000 of that tribe were killed, wounded, or taken ; the remain der soon after abandoned their country, and joined the Five Nations, with whom they have ever since remained. After this the infant colony continued in peace, and flourished under she general government of South Caro lina, till about the year 1729, when seven of the proprie tors, for a valuable consideration, vested their property and jurisdiction in the crown, and the colony was erected into a separate province by the name of North Carolina, and its limits established by an order of George II. From this period to the revolution iu 1776, the history of that province is unpublished, and of course unknown, except NO. xxi. 3 q"], [506, "484 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. to those who had access to the records. Some of the most important events that have since taken place, have been already mentioned in the general history of the United States. In the year 1785, the inhabitants of the counties of Sullivan, Green, and Washington, which lie directly west of the mountains in this state, and now form a part of East Tennessee, convened in committees, appointed and held a convention, framed a constitution, elected their governor, and in short erected themselves into a separate independent state, by the name of the new state of Franklin. This premature state was to comprehend all that tract of country which lies between the mountains and the Suck or Whirl in Tennessee river. These pro ceedings caused great confusion and warm disputes in North Carolina, which continued to rage till the year 1788, when all pretensions te independency were relin quished, and tranquillity was restored to the state. The inhabitants took an early part in the war for inde pendence, and sent thousands of men to the defence of Georgia and South Carolina, and also gave occasional succours to Virginia ; while at home their own state suf fered severely. In 1774, they appointed three delegates to the first congress ; and though their legislature at first rejected the federal constitution of 1787, by a majority of J00,viz. 176 against seventy-six ; yet they again assembled in convention in November, 1789, and ratified it by a ma jority of 118, viz. 193 to seventy-five. At present this state sends two senators and twelve representatives to the general congress. STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA. Situation, Boundaries, and Extent. This state is situated between 32\u00b0 6' and 35\u00b0 N. lat. and 1\u00b0 30' and 6\u00b0 25' W. long. It is bounded on the north and north-east by North Carolina, south-east by the Atlantic ocean, and south-west by Georgia. From east to west it is 216 miles in length, and from north to south 162 in breadth ; containing _t8,700 square miles, or 18,368,000 acres."], [507, "485 STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA. Rivers. \u2014 South Carolina is remarkably well watered ; principally by sour large navigable rivers, besides a great number of small ones, which are passable in boats. The Santee is the largest river in the state, and is formed by two considerable streams, the Congeree and Wateree, in the inferior of the country. Thence running upwards of 100 miles, in an east-south-east direction, falls into the Atlantic ocean by two channels not far apart. The Wateree river rises at the foot of the mountains in North Carolina, where it is denominated the Catabaw, from pass- ing the Cat abaw tribe of Indians, and pursuing a south-east course, is joined by many tributary streams, and forms a junction with the Congeree, upwards of 200 miles from its source. The Congeree rises also in North Carolina, within a few miles of the Calabaw, pursues a south-east course about seventy mites, when it crosses she state line, and runs due south about fifty. miles; it then runs south-east about 130 miles, and forms the junction aforesaid. In its passage through South Carolina it receives a great many tributary streams, some of which are large rivers, particularly the Tyger, Enneree, and Reedy rivers. The Great Pedee river rises in North Carolina, where it is called Yadkin; in South Carolina it takes the name of Pedee, and, next to the Santee, is the largest river in the state. After receiving several tributary streams, particu- larly the Little Pedee, Black river, and Lynche's creek, it joins the Wakamaw river, near Georgetown. These united streams, with tlie accession of a small creek upon which Georgetown stands, form Winyaw bay, which about twelve miles below communicates with the ocean. The Great Pedee is upwards of 300 mites in length, is naviga- ble for sea vessels to Georgetown, and for boats of sixty or seventy tons, about 200 miles. Its banks are said to be fertile, but in the low country are very unhealthy. The Savannah river, which forms the boundary line be- tween South Carolina and Georgia, through its whole course, will be described with the latter state. Cooper and Ashley rivers, which form a junction at Charleston, constitute a spacious and convenient harbour, and com- municates with the ocean just below Sullivan's island. Cooper river rises about fifty miles north-west of Charles- ton, not far from the Santee ; it is a mile wide nine miles above Charleston, and is navigable to its source, from whence there is a canal to Santee river, which opens a communication between Charleston and the interior coun- try. Ashley river rises to the north-west of Charleston, and derives its principal importance from the circumstance"], [508, "486 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. of its forming part of the harbour of that city. The other rivers of this state extend, in general, but a short distance from the ocean, and serve, by branching into numberless creeks, as drains to carry off the rain water which comes down from the large inland swamps, or are merely arms of the sea. The tide in no part of the state flows above twenty-five miles into the country. Face ofthe country, soil, climate, and produce. \u2014 South Carolina has a sea-coast on the Atlantic, extending nearly 200 miles, to which all its rivers flow. The low country extends from the borders of the sea for 120 miles, widening as it gets towards the south. The space that this extent embraces is nearly a continued level, almost without a stone, and abounds more or less, especially near the rivers, with swamps or marshes, which, when cleared and culti vated, yield on an average from twenty to forty dollars for each acre, and often much more ; but this species of soil cannot be cultivated by white men, without endanger ing both health and life. The whole of the low country presents an even regular soil, formed by a blackish sand, and pretty deep. Seven-tenths of it is covered with pines of one species, which as the soil is drier and lighter, grow loftier and uot so branchy ; in some places they are interspersed with oaks. The pine barrens are crossed by little swamps, in tlie midst of which generally flows a rivulet, and they have diffe rent degrees of fertility, indi cated by the trees that grow on them. In the upper country, the most fertile lands are situated upon the bor ders of the rivers and creeks ; the lands that occupy the intermediate spaces are much less fertile. The latter are not much cultivated, and those who are in possession of them are obliged to be perpetually clearing them to obtain more abundant harvests. The forests are Chiefly com posed of oaks, hickory, maple, and poplar ; chesnut trees do not begin to appear for sixty miles on this side of the mountains. At the distance of about 140 miles from Charleston, and at the termination of that species of soil just described, is a plneo called the Ridge. This ridge is a remarkable tract of high ground, as you approach it from the sea, but level as you advance north-west from its summit. It is a fine, high, healthy belt of land, well watered, and of a good soil, extending from the Savannah to Broad river. Be yond this ridge commences a country exactly resembling the northern states ; here hills and dales, with all their"], [509, "487 STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA. verdure and variegated beauty, present themselves to the eye. Wheat fields, which are rare in the low country, begin to grow common ; and here Heaven has bestowed its blessings with a bounteous hand. The air is much more temperate and healthful than nearer the sea ; the hills are covered with valuable woods, the valleys watered with beautiful rivers, and the fertility of the soil is equal to every vegetable production. This, by way of distinc- tion is called the Upper Country, where are different modes and different articles of cultivation ; where the man- ners of the people and even their language have a diffe- rent tone. The land still rises by a gradual ascent ; each succeeding hill overlooking that which precedes it, till having advanced 220 miles in a north-west direction from Charleston, the elevation of the land above the sea-coast is found by mensuration to be 800 feet. Here commences a mountainous country, which continues rising to the western terminating point of the state. The mountains are ranged in regular directions; and of the particular summits Table mountain is most remark- able It rises in Pendleton district, four or five miles from the north boundary of the state, and is 3,168 feet higher than the surrounding country ; probably 4,300 above the ocean. On one side is a precipice of solid rock, 900 feet perpendicular ; the valley below is equally deep on that side, making the height of the chasm 6 or 800 yards : westward, and separated only by a valley, rises the lofty Colenoy. In the same district the Occonnee mountain lifts its summit 5 or 600 yards above the adjacent lands; and from Paris mountain is a delightful prospect. Much iron ore and a specimen of gold have been sound bere : near its base is a sulphur spring of great powers. The soil may be divided into four kinds ; first, the pine barren, which is valuable only for its timber ; interspersed among these barrens, are tracts of land free of timber, and every kind of growtb except that of grass. These tracts are called Savannas, constituting a second kind of soil, good for grazing. The third kind is that of the swamps and low grounds on the rivers, which is a mixture of black loam and fat clay, producing naturally canes in great plenty, cypress, bays, &c. In these swamps rice is cultivated, which is the staple commodity of the state. The high lands commonly known by the name of oak and hickory lands, constitute the fourth kind of soil. On the lands, in the low country, are cultivated Indian corn principally ; and in the back country, besides these, they raise tobacqo in large quantities, wheat, rye, barley, oats,"], [510, "488 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. hemp, flax, and cotton. From experiments which have been made, it is well ascertained that olives, silk, and mad- der may be as abundantly produced in South Carolina, and in Georgia also, as in the south ofFrance. There is little fruit in this state, especially in the lower parts of it; but it is very probable that the various species of fruit-trees which flourish in France, would succeed very well in the upper county. About 200 miles from the sea- coast, the apple-trees are magnificent, and several of the German farmers make cider ; but here, as well as in Ten- nessee, and the greatest part of Kentucky, they are atten- tive only to the cultivation ofthe peach. The other kinds of trees, such as pears, plums, apricots, cherries, mulber- ries, nuts, and goosberries, are very little known, except by uame. The major part of the inhabitants do not even cultivate vegetables ; and there is scarcely one out of twenty of them that plants a small bed of cabbages', and when they do, it is in the same field as the Indian corn. That portion of this state best adapted to rice lauds, lies on the banks of the rivers, aud does not extend higher up than the head of the tides ; and in estimating the value of this rice ground, the height which the tide rises is taken into consideration ; those lying where it rises high enough to overflow the swamps being the most valuable. The best inland swamps, which constitute a second species of rice land, are such as are furnished with reserves of water. These reserves are formed by means of large banks thrown up at the upper part ofthe swamps, whence it is conveyed, when needed, to the fields of rice. Through the whole of this swampy country, to the extent of forty or fifty miles inland, and much higher upon rivers, as also in the islands on the sea-coast, the cultivators are all slaves. No white man, to speak generally, ever thinks of settling a farm and improving it for himself, without negroes ; if he has none, he hires himself to some rich planter, till he can purchase for himself. The articles cultivated are Indian corn, rye, oats, every species of pulse, and sweet potatoes, which, with the small rice, are food for the negroes ; rice, indigo, cotton, and some hemp, for exportation. In the middle settlements, slaves are not so numerous; the master attending personally to his own business. The land is not properly adapted for rice; but it produces tolerable good indigo, and some tobacco. The farmer is contented to raise Indian corn, potatoes, oats, rye, and a little wheat. A great part of the agricultural labour here is performed by the white people; and so great is the."], [511, "489 STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA. difference in this respect from the low country, that wo may reckon there are two white persons to one black, whereas in the other there are two blacks to one white person. In the upper country, there are but few negroes ; gene rally speaking, the farmers have none, and depend, like the inhabitants of the northern states, upon the labour of themselves aud families for subsistence. The plough is used almost entirely, and Indian corn in great quantities, wheat, rye, barley, oats, good potatoes, &c. are raised for food ; tobacco, wheat, cotton, hemp, flax, and indigo, for exportation. This elevated district abounds with precious ores, such as gold, silver, lead, black lead, copper, and iron. There are also to be found pellucid stones, rock crystal, cornelians, marble, beautifully variegated, red and yellow ochres, potters clay of an excellent quality, fuller's earth, and a number of dye-stuffs. Chalk, crude alum, sulphur, nitre, and vitriol, are produced in abundance; and along the banks of rivers marl may be collected. The climate is different in different sections ofthe state. In the low country, the summers are exceedingly hot and sultry, and the heat abates but little, except in the even ings and mornings, till past the middle of October. From the first of July to that period, the country is in many places subject to much sickness, particularly bilious severs, agues, &c. The probability of dying is much greater between the 20th of June and the 20th of October, than in the other eight months of the year. The fall weather is generally beautiful, and continues till past Christmas; the average temperature is greater than an English summer. The winters are very mild, and there is very little frost ; but the weather is sometimes subject to great and sudden changes. The spring commences about the middle of February, and they have often green peas in the market by the middle of March; but the weather intermits very much till about the first of May, when it gets steadily warm, and continues increasing with the season till September, when it begins somewhat to abate. Almost every person who can afford it, removes to a more healthy situation during this period, and avast number go to the northern states in the summer, and return in the fall. The period of going north is mostly from the mid dle of May to the middle of July, and of returning, from the middle of October to the middle of November. The anxiety that prevails during that period is extreme, and when it is over, the inhabitants congratulate one another with the full prospect of ten or eleven months being added"], [512, "490 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. to their existence ! In the upper country, the summers are much more temperate, and being removed from the swamps, there is no sickness : towards the mountains the climate is delightful. One principal cause ofthe diseases to which the inhabit ants of this state are subject is a low marshy country; which is occasionally overflowed sor the sake of cultivating rice. When the water is dried up or drawn off from the surface of the ground, a quantity of weeds and grass which have been rotted by this water, and animals and fish which have been destroyed by it, are exposed to the intense heat of the sun, and help to infect the air with a quantity of poisonous effluvia. But within the limits of Charleston, the case is very different, and the danger of contracting diseases chiefly arises from indolence and excess. Violent exercise on horseback or on foot, exposure to the meri dian rays of the sun, sudden showers of rain, and the night air, are too frequently the causes of fevers, agues, and other disorders. With regard to the rice swamps, it has been satisfactorily ascertained, that by removing three miles from them, into the pine land, an exemption from autumnal fevers may be obtained ; and would the sports men deny themselves, during the sickly months, their favourite amusements of hunting and fishing, or confine themselves to a very few hours in the morning or evening; would the industrious planter visit his fields only at the same hours ; or would the poorer class of people pay due attention to their manner of living, much sickness and many distressing events might be prevented. Civil divisions, towns, population, religion, character, &c. \u2014 South Carolina was originally divided into nine dis tricts ; Charleston, Beaufort, and Georgetown districts constituting what is called the Lower Country ; and Ninety-Six, Washington, Pinckney, Camden, Orange burgh, and Cheraw districts, caUed the Upper Country. These nine districts were afterwards formed into twenty six subdivisions, or judicial circuits ; at present the state is divided into thirty-six counties, containing, by the last general census, 415,115 inhabitants, of whom 196,365 are slaves. By the enumeration of 1817, the population amounted to 564,785 ; being above nineteen to the square mile. Counties. Population, Chief Towns and Population. Abbeville . . . 21,150 . .

The plan of the city is regular, and opens beautiful pros pects ; but many of the streets are too narrow for so large a place and so warm a climate. The houses are partly built of brick and partly of wood, many of which are elegant, and most of them are neat, airy, and well furnish ed. The public buildings are a court-house, an exchange, college, armoury, three banks, alms-house, orphan's-house, &c. and eighteen places for public worship, belonging to episcopalians,independents, Scotch presbyterians, baptists, German Lutherans, quakers, French protestants, metho dists, Roman catholics, Unitarians, and Jews. The mar kets are tolerably well attended to, but provisions are by no means so good as they are in the northern states, though much higher in price. The following were the rates in Charleston market, at the latter end of April, 1819: Beef, pork, and mutton, lOd. sterling per lb. ; lamb and veal, 13\\d. ; fowls, 6s. 9d. per pair ; ducks, 4s. 6_. each ; turkeys, Ils. 3d. : there were no geese on sate, and fish were very scarce and dear. The people of Charleston have been long celebrated for politeness and hospitality ; aud, in- deed, no where can unaffected kindness, affability, and good manners, be found in a greater degree than in this city. Here are no manufactures of importance, but there is a very active commerce, particularly in the winter season ; and a great number of ships are constantly arriving and departing, which causes the city to be very lively. The principal foreign trade is to Europe and the West Indies; of which Great Britain occupies a large share, and a con siderable portion is confined to Glasgow. The great articles for exportation are cotton and rice, particularly the former ; and the imports consist of East and West India goods, groceries, and British manufactures. Nearly all the shipping of South Carolina belong to the port of Charleston ; the tonnage of which amounted to 52,888 tons, when that of the whole state was no more than 53,926 tons. Besides the foreign commerce of this city, it has an extensive inland trade with the Upper Carolinas and Georgia; the inhabitants of those districts preferring Charleston to Wilmington and Savannah, because in the former place commerce is more active, and the sales more easy. The articles they carry there consist chiefly in short cotton, tobacco, hams, salt buffer, wax, stag and bearskins, and cattle. They take in return, coarse iron ware, tea, coffee, powder sugar, coarse cloths, and fine linen. Charleston is 62 miles distant from Georgetown, 114 from Savannah, 580 from Nashville, Tennessee, 544"], [515, "493 STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA. from the city of Washington, and 686 from Philadelphia. N. lat. 32\u00b0 44'. Georgetown, the only seaport in South Carolina, except Charleston, is situated at the confluence of Pedee and Black rivers, twelve mites from the sea. Its situation connects it with an extensive back country of both the Carolinas, and it would be a place of great importance, were it not sor a bar at the entrance of the bay, which pre vents the admission of large vessels. It has nevertheless a considerable trade, particularly in rice, of which it is said that the lands in its neighbourhood produce 30,000 tierces annually. The houses are chiefly built of wood, and are but indifferent. The public buildings are a court house, academy, and jail; four places for worship, of which the episcopalians, baptists, presbyterians, and me thodists have one each. In the academy, orphans and indigent children are educated gratis. Columbia, ou the Congeree river, 1 13 miles from Charles ton, and 507 from Washington, is the seat of government for this state, and is a plaee of considerable trade. The Streets are regular, but the number of houses yet built does not exceed 200 ; they are almost all of wood, and painted gray and yellow ; and though there are few of them more than two stories high, they have a very respectable appear ance. The public offices have, in some measure, been divided, for the accommodation of the inhabitants of the lower counties, and a branch of each retained in Charles ton. The South Carolina college is established in this town, and was incorporated in 1801. The inhabitants of the upper country, who do not approve of sending their provisions to Charleston, stop at Columbia, where they dispose of them at several respectable stores established in she town. Beaufort, the chief town of the district of that name, is situated at the mouth of Coosawatchie river, is a pleasant little place of about 200 houses, an episcopal and a baptist church, four school houses, and 1,000 inhabitants, who are distinguished for their bospitality and politeness. It is a thriving town, in a healthy situation, 71 miles north west of Charleston, and bids fair to become a place of con sideration. Camden, the principal town of Kershaw county, stands on the east side of Wateree river, 35 miles north-east of Columbia, and 121 north-west of Charleston. It is regu larly laid out, and contains about 200 houses, an episcopal church, a court-house and jail. The navigable river on which the town stands, enables the inhabitants to carry"], [516, "494 UNITED STATES OF A.MERICA. on a lively trade with the back country. This town, or near it, was the scene of two battles during the revolution ary war. On the 16th of August, 1780, between general Gates and lord Cornwallis, in which the Americans were defeated. The other on the 25th April, 1781, when lord Rawdon (now marquis of Hastings) sallied out of the town with 800 men, and attacked the American camp under general Green. The Americans had 126 men killed, and 100 taken prisoners, and the British had 100 killed. About a fortnight afterwards the town was evacuated, after lord Rawdon had burned the jail, all the mills, many private houses, and a part of his own baggage. \u2014 Besides these towns, are Purysburgh, Cambridge, Orangeburgh, New bury, Pendleton, Winnsborough, Fairfield, &c. all incon siderable villages, of from 40 to 80 dwelling-houses. Since the revolution, by which all denominations of Christians were put upon an equal footing, there have been no disputes between different religious sects. They all agree to differ. The upper parts of the state are settled chiefly by presbyterians, baptists, and methodists. From the most probable calculations, it is supposed that the religious classes of this state, as to numbers, may be ranked as follows : presbyterians, including the congregational and independent churches, episcopalians, baptists, me thodists, &c. In the character and manners of the people of South Carolina there is no peculiarity, except what arises from the mischievous influence of slavery ; which, of course, produces the same effects here as in other places. This pernicious system, by exempting great numbers from the necessities of labour, leads to luxury, dissipation, and ex travagance ; but notwithstanding, the people have con siderably improved in education and morals since the revolution The Carolinians sooner arrive at maturity, both in their bodies and minds, than the natives of colder climates. They possess a natural quickness and vivacity superior to the inhabitants ofthe north ; but too generally want their enterprise and perseverance. The wealth pro duced by the labour of slaves, furnishes their proprietors with the means of hospitality ; and no people in the world use their means with more liberality : they are gene rally affable and easy in their manners, and polite and attentive to strangers. Ii was customary- for a long time, for the more wealthy planters to send their sons to Europe for education ; and even now they frequently send them to the northern states; but the practice is gradually declining, and the desire has"], [517, "495 STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA. become general to have respectable seminaries in the state. The South Carolina college at Columbia, already noticed, is very liberally endowed ; and there are several other colleges and academies throughout the state, particularly at Beaufort, Winnsborough, Cambridge, aud Charleston. The towns are pretty well supplied with common schools, but they are defective in the country ; and this branch of education being the basis of the morality ofthe state, de serves, and will no doubt receive, the early attention of the legislature. Trade, manufactures, &c. \u2014 The foreign trade of South Carolina is with Europe and the West Indies. To these Countries are exported rice, indigo, cotton, tobacco, tar, pitch, turpentine, timber, skins, Indian corn, leather, &c. The imports chiefly consist of British manufactures, wines, spirits, groceries, salt, cordage, mahogany, &c. The ex ports, in 1791, amounted to 2,693,267 dollars; in 1796, to 7,620,049; in 1799, to 8,729,015; in 1805, to 9,060,625; and in 1817, to 10,372,613 dollars, of which 9,944,343 was domestic produce. The little attention that has hitherto been paid to manufactures, occasions a vast consumption of foreign imported articles ; but the quantity and quality ofthe article exported generally leave a balance in favour of the state. Charleston is by far the most considerable city on the sea-coast for an extent of 600 miles. The average annual amount of exported native commodities from this port alone, is not less than 4,000,000 dollars. Besides supplying nearly all the inhabitants of South Carolina with imported goods, it is also the great emporium for most of the people of North Carolina and Georgia. The harbour continues open all the winter, and its con tiguity to the West India islands gives the merchants supe rior advantages for carrying on a peculiarly lucrative commerce. The manufactures of this state are mostly of the domestic kind, for family use. In the middle, and especially in the upper country, the inhabitants manufacture their own cotton and woollen cloths, aud most of their husbandry tools; but in the lower districts, for these articles, the people depend almost entirely upon their merchants. In the interior parts of the state, cotton, flax, and hemp, are in great abundance, with a large stock of good sheep, and great improvements have been made in family manufac tures : the women perform the weaving, and leave the men to attend to agriculture. There are several consider-"], [518, "496 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. able iron works in this state, particularly in York county, near Catabaw river, where within two miles of she fur nace an inexhaustible quantify of excellent ore may be found. The manufacture of indigo is also arrived at tolerable perfection, and bids fair to rival that of France, or even Spain. The forests furnish timber of the very best kind for ship-building; the live oak, and the pitch and yellow pines being of a superior quality. But it must be acknowledged, that manufactures of all kinds in South Carolina are still in a state of infancy. Constitution. \u2014 The civil government is, like that of the other states, legislative, executive, and judiciary. The legislative power is vested in a general assembly, consist- ing of a senate aud house of representatives. The senators are chosen sor sour years, and oue half vacate their seats every two years. They must be thirty-five years of age, and possessed of a freehold estate of the value of \u00a3300 sterling, clear of debt. Every free white man of the age of twenty-one years, being a citizen of the state, and having resided therein two years previous to the election, votes for the members of both branches of the legislature, in the place where he resides, or where he has his freehold. The representatives must be twenty-one years osage, and be possessed of a freehold estate of \u00a3150, clear of debt. The executive government is vested iu a governor, chosen for two years, by the legislature ; and the qualifications to sill that office are, that he be thirty years of age, and be possessed of \u00a31,500 sterling. The judges of the superior courts, commissioners of the treasury, secretary of state, and surveyor general, are all elected by the legislature. The liberty of the press is for ever to be preserved invio- late. All religions societies, who acknowledge that there is one God, a future state of rewards and punishments, and that God is to be publicly worshipped, are freely tolerated. Ministers of the gospel are ineligible to any of the civil offices of the state. \u2014 The laws of this state have nothing in them of a particular nature, excepting what arises from the permission of slavery. The evidence ofa slave cannot be taken against a white man ; and the master who kills his slave is not punishable, otherwise than by a pecuniary sine, and twelve months imprisonment. History.\u2014 An account of the first British settlement in Carolina has been already given, page 13 ; but nothing was effectually done towards the final establishment ofthe colony before the year 1669. At this time the proprietors,,"], [519, "497 STATE OF SO-TH CAROLINA. in virtue of their powers, engaged the famous Mr. Locke to frame for them a constitution and body of laws. The. constitution, consisting of 120 articles, was aristocratical, and though ingenious iu theory, could never be success fully reduced to practice. Three classes of nobility were to be established, viz. barons, cnssiqucs, and landgraves. The first to possess twelve, the second twenty-sour, the third forty-eight thousand acres of land, which was to be unalienable. In 1669, William Sayle being appointed first governor of this country, embarked with a colony, and settled on the neck of land where Charleston now stands. During the continuance of the proprietary government, a period of fifty years, reckoning from 1669 to 1719, the colony was involved in perpetual quarrels. Oftentimes they were harassed by the Indians, sometimes infested with pirates, frequently invaded by the French and Spanish fleets, con stantly uneasy under their injudicious government, and quarrelling with their governors. But their most bitter dissensions were respecting religion. The episcopalians, being more numerous than the dissenters, attempted to exclude the latter from a seat in the legislature. These attempts were so far successful, as that the church of England, by a majority of votes, was established by law. This illiberal act threw the colony into the utmost con fusion, and was followed by a train of evil consequences, which proved to be the principal cause of the revolution. Notwithstanding the act establishing the church of Eng land was repealed, tranquillity was not restored to the colony. A change of government was generally desired by the colonists. They found they were not sufficiently protected by their proprietary constitution, and effect ed a revolution about the year 1719, and the government became regal. In 1728, the proprietors accepted \u00a322,500 sterling from the crown, sor the property aud jurisdiction, except lord Granville, who reserved his eighth ofthe pro perty, which has never yet been formally given up. At this time the constitution was new modelled, aud the territory, limited by the original charter, was divided into North and South Carolinas. From this period the colony began to flourish. It was protected by a government, formed on the plan of the English constitution. Under the fostering care of the mother country, its growth was astonishingly rapid. Between the years 1763 and 1775, the number of inhabitants was more than doubled. No one indulged a wish for a change in their political con stitution, till the memorable stamp act, passed in 1765 ;"], [520, "498 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. from which time till 1775, various attempts were made by Great Britain to tax her colonies without their consent. These attempts were invariably opposed. The congress, who met at Philadelphia this year, unanimously approved the opposition, and on the 19th of April war commenced. During the vigorous contest for independence, this state was a great sufferer. For three years it was the seat of the war. It feels and laments the loss of many of its noble citizens. Since the peace it has been emerging from that melancholy confusion and poverty in which it was generally involved by the devastations ofa relentless enemy. The inhabitants are fast multiplying by emigra tions from the other states, the agricultural interests ofthe state are reviving, commerce is flourishing, economy is becoming more fashionable, and science begins to spread her salutary influences among the citizens. South Caro lina, from her natural commercial aud agricultural advan tages, and the abilities of her leading characters, promises to become one ofthe richest states in the Union. The damages which this state sustained in the revolu tionary war, are thus estimated : she two entire crops of 1780 and 1781, both of which were used by the British, The crop of 1782 taken by the Americans, about 25,000 negroes, many thousand pounds worth of plate, and household furniture in abundance, the villages of George town and Camden burnt, the loss to the citizens directly by the plunderings and devastations of the British army, aud indirectly by American impressments, and by the depreciation of the paper currency, together with the heavy debt of \u00a31,200,000 sterling, incurred for the sup port ofthe war, in one aggregate view, make the price of independence to South Carolina, exclusive of the blood of its citizens, upwards of \u00a33,000,000 sterling. STATE OF GEORGIA. Situation, Boundaries, and Extent. This state is situated between 30\u00b0 30' and 35\u00b0 N. lat. aud 3\u00b0 50' and 9\u00b0 5' W. long. It is bounded on the north by North Carolina and Tennessee ; north-east, by South Carolina : south, byT Florida ; east, by the Atlantic ocean: aud west, by West Florida and the Alabama territory. Its"], [521, "499 STATE OF GEORGIA. length from north to south is 300 miles, and its breadth from east to west 240 miles ; forming an area of about 58,000 square miles, or 37,120,000 acres. Rivers, mountains, and general aspect of the country. \u2014 Georgia is remarkably well supplied with rivers aud small streams. The Savannah river is one ofthe most important in America, and has been already noticed as forming a part of the divisional line which separates this state from South Carolina. Its head waters consist of two small rivers, the Tugulo and Keowee, which rise near the mountains, and form a junction about 220 miles from the sea ; from thence it runs a south-east course, and fells into the Atlantic ocean seventeen miles below the town of Savannah, to which place it is navigable for ships of 250 tons burden, and for boats of 150 feet keel to Augusta, 123 miles distant (by land.) After a fall just above this town, it can be navigated eighty miles higher, in small boats, to the mouth of Tugulo river. The flood was so great in Savannah river in February, 1796, that the water rose thirty-five feet above its ordinary level, and above nine feet higher than ever was known before : in Augusta the streets were plied by boats which could carry fifteen tons. If may be remarked, that through the medium of this fine river a considerable part of the produce of South Carolina is carried to Savannah market. The Altamaha, about sixty miles south of Savannah river, is formed by the junction of the Okonee and Okemulgee branches, the former of which rises near the mountains, about 300 miles from Savannah, and running a south-ea.st course, is joined by the Apalachy and after wards by a great number of tributary streams, till it forms a junction with the Okemulgee, 100 miles from the ocean. From thence the Altamaha runs east-south-east, and falls into the Atlantic below the town of Darien, to which it is navigable for large vessels. The Okemulgee is a large river, rising near the Apalachy, from whence to its con fluence with the Okonee it runs upwards of 200 miles. The little Ogeeche is a considerable river, and falls into the Altamaha, from the northward, after this junction. The Chatahouchy is a very large river, and forms the western boundary of Georgia from the Florida line, 125 miles up the country. It rises at the foot of the moun tains, near the head of Savannah river, and runs south wardly above 200 miles, to where it forms the state line. From thence it pursues a course a little east of south, to Florida river, where it forms a junction with Flint river, 3s '"], [522, "500 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. and assumes tbe name of Apalachicola; it then runs a south-east course eighty miles, to the gulf of Mexico, which it enters by several mouths. Flint river is about 300 yards broad, and twelve or fifteen feet deep. It rises near the Okemulgee river, and runs, with a clear gentle current, a course to the west of south upwards of 200 miles. St. Mary's river rises in Okefanoke swamp, and running about 100 miles by a very crooked course, but rather east wardly, forms the boundary line between the United States and East Florida, dnring its whole passage, and falls into the sea at St. Mary's, where it forms a good har bour. Its banks afford immense quantities of fine timber, suited to the West India market. \u2014 Besides these there is Turtle river, Great Sitilla, Little Sitilla, Crooked river, and the Ogeche. All these rivers are stored with a great variety of fish, as rock, mullet, whiting, shad, trout, drum, bass, catfish, bream, and sturgeon ; aud the bays and lagoons are filled with oysters, and other shell fish, crabs, shrimps, &c. This state, like the Carolinas, is naturally divided into two districts, the upper and the lower ; of which the boundaries are remarkably well defined. The eastern part, between the ocean and the mountains, and the rivers Savannah and St. Mary's, a tract of country more than 120 miles from north to south, and forty or fifty east and west, is entirely level, without a hill or stone. At the distance of about fifty miles from the sea shore, the lands begin to be more or less uneven ; the ridges gradually rising one above another into hills, and the bills succes sively increasing in height till they finally terminate in mountains. That vast chain which commences with Cats- kill, near Hudson's river, in the state of New York, known by the name of the Allegany mountains, terminate in this state, about sixty miles south of its northern boundary. From the foot of this mountain spreads a wide extended plain, of the richest soil, and in a latitude and climate favourably adapted to the cultivation of most ofthe East India productions, and those of the south of Europe. The state has a sea-coast of 100 miles, which is indented with bays and inlets, and studded with islands, well known by the name of Sea Islands These islands are surround ed by navigable creeks, between which and the main land is a large extent of salt marsh, fronting the whole state, not less than four or five miles in breadth, intersected witb creeks in various directions, admitting, through the whole, an inland navigation, between the islands and the main"], [523, "501 STATE OF GEORGIA. land, from the north-east to the south-east corners of the state. Among these islands are the entrances ofthe rivers from the interior country, winding through the low salt marshes, and delivering their waters into the sounds, which form capacious harbours of from three to eight miles wide, and which communicate with each other by parallel salt creeks, ln the southern part of the state lies a portion of Okefanoke swamp, one of the most remark able in the world. It is situated between Flint and Okemulgee rivers, and is nearly 300 miles in circumfe rence. In wet seasons it appears like an inland sea, and has several large islands of rich land ; one of which the Creek Indians represent as the most blissful spot upon earth. The rivers St. Mary and Sitilla, which fall into the Atlantic, and the beautiful little St. Juan, which empties into the bay of Apalachy, in the gulf of Mexico, flow from this lake. About ninety miles from the sea in a direct line, as you advance towards the mountains, is a very surprising bank of oyster shells of an uncommon size. They run in a direction nearly parallel with the sea-coast, in three dis tinct ridges near each other, which together occupy a space seven miles in breadth ! The ridges commence at Savannah river, and have been traced to the northern branches ofthe Altamaha This remarkable phenomenon cannot be accounted for in any other manner than by sup posing that the sea-shore was formerly near this immense bed of shells ; and that the ocean has, by the operation of certain causes not yet fully investigated, receded within its present bounds. These shells are an inexhaustible source of wealth to the neighbouring inhabitants, who carry them away in vast quantities for the purpose of making lime. Climate, soil, productions, &c. \u2014 The climate in many parts of tbis state cannot be esteemed healthy, at particu lar seasons of the year. In the low country near the rice swamps, bilious complaints and fevers of various kinds are pretty universal during the months of July, August, and September, which, for this reason, are called the sickly months. The disorders peculiar to this climate originate chiefly from the badness of the water, which is generally brackish, and from the noxious putrid vapours which arc exhaled from the stagnant waters in the rice swamps. Besides, the long continuance of warm weather produces a general relaxation of the nervous system ; and as the"], [524, "502 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. inhabitants have no necessary labours to call them to exer cise, a large share of indolence is the natural consequence; aud indolence, especially among a luxurious people, is ever the parent of disease. Another cause of disorders is, the immense quantities of spirituous liquors which are used to correct the brackishness of the water, form a species of intemperance, which too often prove ruinous to the constitution. The winters in Georgia are very mild and pleasant, and snow is seldom or never seen. In the hilly country, which commences about 100 miles from the sea, the air is pure and salubrious, and the water plenty and good. In the flat country, there is here and there only a spring, which is clear and tolerably pure. In the south-east parts of this state, which lie within a few de grees of the torrid zone, the atmosphere is kept in motion by impressions from the trade winds. This serves to purify the air, and render it fit for respiration ; so that it is found to have a very advantageous effect on persons of consumptive habits. The soil and its fertility are various, according to situ ation and different improvement. In the islands on the sea-coast, the natural growth is pine, oak, hickory, live oak (an uncommonly hard and very valuable wood) and some red cedar. These trees indicate a very fertile soil, and on cultivation it yields excellent crops of cotton, indigo, Indian corn, and potatoes. That superior kind of cotton well known in England by the name of Sea Island cotton, is raised in these islands ; particularly in St. Symons and Cumberland isles. The soil ofthe main land, adjoining the marshes and creeks, is nearly of the same quality with that ofthe islands ; except that which borders on those rivers which stretch far back iuto the country. On these, immediately after leaving the salt marsh, begin the valuable rice swamps, which on cultivation afford abundance of that great article of commerce. The soil between the rivers, after you leave the edge of the swamps, at the distance of twenty or thirty miles, changes from a gray to a red colour, on which grow plenty of oak and hickory, with some pine. In some places it is gravelly, but fertile, and so continues for a number of miles, gradu ally deepening thc reddish colour of the earth, till it changes into what is called the mulatto soil, consisting of a black and red earth. These mulatto lands are gene rally strong, and yield large crops of wheat, tobacco, Indian com, &c. To this kind of land succeeds by turns a soil nearly black and very rich, on which grow large quantities of black walnut, mulberry, &c. This succession"], [525, "503 STATE OF GEORGIA. of the different soils continues uniform and regular, though there are some large veins of all the different soils inter mixed ; and what is more remarkable, this succession, in the order mentioned, stretches across this state nearly parallel with the sea-coast, and extends through the several states, nearly in the same direction, to the banks of Hudson's river. The agriculture and produce of this state are nearly similar to those of South Carolina. Cotton, rice, indigo, silk, Indian corn, potatoes, oranges, figs, &c. ; but neither of tbe two fruits last mentioned can be recommended for excellence. The figs tnrn sour a few days after they have acquired the last degree of maturity; and the oranges consumed in Georgia and the Carolinas are not the pro duce of those states, but are brought from the island of St. Anastasia, situate opposite St. Augustin, the capital of East Florida : they are sweet, very large, fine skinned, and more esteemed than those brought from the West Indies. Cotton and rice are the staple commodities of this state ; much tobacco is also raised ; but as the land on which it grows is equally adapted for wheat, which is a much less exhausting crop, it is more than probable that in a short time the latter will entirely supercede the former. On the dry plains grow large crops of sweet potatoes, which are sound to afford a wholesome nourishment, and from which is made a kind of whisky tolerably good, but in ferior to that made from rye. By properly bruising and washing this root a sediment or starch is made, which has obtained the name of sago, and answers all the purposes of the Indian sago. Most of the tropical fruits would undoubtedly flourish in this state, with proper attention. The rice plant has been transplanted into it, and the tea plant may in like manner be introduced, with equal or superior advantage. The latitude, the soil, and the temperature of the climate, all invite to make the ex periment ; and it is hot hazarding much to predict, that at no distant period, the south-western parts of this state, and the parts of Florida which lie adjoining, will become the vineyard of the United States. Civil divisions, towns, population, religion, character, &c. \u2014 Georgia before the revolution, was divided into parishes, afterwards into three districts, and since into two judiciary districts, viz. Upper and Lower, which are again subdivided into thirty-nine counties, containing by the last general census, in 1810, 252,433 inhabitants of whom 105,218 were slaves. Of the whole number, only"], [526, "504 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 13,673 had obtained the age of forty-five years, while in New Jersey, with a population of nearly 7,000 less, the number of persons of forty-five years osage and upwards amounted to 31,113, and in Connecticut, where the popu lation was only 9,500 more than Georgia, the number who bad arrived at the age of forty-five amounted to 43,180. \u2014 By the state census of 1817, the number of inhabitants was 40S,567, being an increase of 156,134 in the space of seven years.

The city is regularly laid out on a handsome plan, and is about a mile in length from east to west, and a quarter of a mile in breadth. Tt consists of thirty streets, sixteen squares, and six lanes, containing about 1,000 houses, and upwards of 5,000 inhabitants, above one half of whom are slaves. The public buildings are a court-house, jail, academy, bank, and five places for worship, belonging to episcopalians, German Lutherans, presbyterians, methodists, and Jews. There has lately been built a very handsome exchange, with a spire and observatory, from whence vessels may be seen out at sea ten or twelve miles. The situation of Savannah is favour able both for health and commerce. The bluff upon which it is built is from fifty to seventy feet high, so that there is a fine descent to the river ; this bluff is a bed of very fine sand, and by digging wells about sixty feet deep, a supply of excellent water is procured, probably a filtra tion from the river. The streets are broad and airy, and the city being only a short distance from the sea, fre quently enjoys a sea breeze, which is cool and refreshing in the summer season. The trade of this city is rather ex tensive with Great Britain and the West Indies ; there is also a considerable number of vessels employed to New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Boston, and Charleston. Besides these there are a number of vessels that come from the northward annually, to take freight for Britain, and the continent of Europe. Savannah is 658 miles dis tant from the city of Washington, 114 from Charleston, and 800 from Philadelphia. Augusta, which was also at one time the capital of this state, is situated on a handsome plain, on the south side of Savannah river, where it is 500 yards wide, 565 miles from Washington, 123 from Savannah, and about 134 from"], [528, "506 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. the sea ; it contains nearly 2,500 inhabitants, more than one half of whom are in a state of slavery. The public buildings are two churches, an academy, a court-house, jail, a market-house, and several public warehouses. The town is at the head of large boat navigation, and carries on a very extensive and profitable trade with Savannah and the back country. Many of the merchants are wealthy, and import their goods ; the greater part of tbe others purchase in New York. The town was originally settled by emigrants from Scotland, but the society is now very mixed, and probably these of Irish extraction are the most numerous. The inhabitants are in general well in- formed, and have a considerable taste for literature They are affable in their deportment, and polite and hospitable to strangers. The country round Augusta is agreeably diversified, and well cultivated ; the whole plain on which it stands being remarkably fertile, and towards the south- west the country rises into considerable hiils, interspersed with fertile plains, extremely favourable for the culture of cotton, the plantations of which are in a very thriving state. This is reckoned the boundary between the high and low country. The falls on the river are three miles above Augusta, and immediately on leaving the town for the westward, the great and pleasing contrast between this and the low country is seen : in place of swamps, marshes, and sandy deserts, the senses are gratified by high rising grounds, rich verdure in the woods, and clear streams of wafer. Milledgeville, the chief town of Baldwin county, is the present seat of government for the state of Georgia. It is situated on the Altamaha river, 158 miles from Savannah, and 675 from Washington city, and is yet a small place, but promises to rise into great importance. Louisville, which was the seat of government sor Georgia immediately before Milledgeville, is situated on the north-east bank of the Great Ogeeche river seventy miles from its mouth, 100 from Savannah, and fifty from Augusta. It consists of about 100 dwelling-houses, and above 500 inhabitants, above 250 of whom are slaves. 11ns town is laid out on an elevated situation, and there is a pretty extensive view to the westward ; but consider able marsh vapour is generated on the banks of the river, which renders the place unhealthy. The country in the neighbourhood is well cultivated, and Louisville contains a civil and well bred society. Large quantities of tobacco are inspected here, and boated down to Savannah ; there are dry goods and grocery stores in the town, and the"], [529, "507 STATE OF GEORGIA. inhabitants have a considerable inland trade. A college, with liberal endowments, is established in its vicinity. Sunbury is beautifully situated in Liberty county, at the head of St. Catharine's sound, about fifteen miles south of Great Ogeeche river ; the harbour is capacious and safe, and has water enough for ships of great burden. It is a very pleasant healthy town, and is the resort of the plant ers from the adjacent country, during the sickly months. It was burnt down during the revolutionary war, but has since been rebuilt. An academy was established here about thirty years ago, which has been under able in structors, and has proved a very useful institution. \u2014 Forty miles south of Savannah. There are no other towns in this state that merit a par ticular description. Besides Savannah and Augusta, there is on the Savannah river, a little town called Petersburgh, and in the interior, between the Savannah and Ogeeche, is Washington : both these are thriving places. On the Great Ogeeche, there are, besides Louisville, Sparta and Greensburgh. On the Altamaha aud its waters, besides Milledgeville, Darien, a new sea-port, fifty-nine miles from Savannah ; and Athens, the seat of a college, 197 miles from Savannah and 89 from Augusta. On St. Mary's river is the town of St. Mary's, at the southern extremity ofthe state. On the subject of religion, the constitution of Georgia declares, \" that no person within the state shall, upon any pretence, be deprived of the inestimable privilege of wor shipping God in a manner agreeably to his own conscience, nor be compelled to attend any place of worship, contrary to his own faith and judgment ; nor shall he ever be obliged to pay tithes, taxes, or any other rates, for the building or repairing any place of worship, or for the maintenance of any minister, or ministry, contrary to what he believes to be right, or hath engaged to do. No religious society shall ever be established in this state in preference to any other ; nor shall any person be denied the enjoyment of any civil right, merely on account of religious principle.\" The different sects are presbyterians, episcopalians, baptists, and methodists; the upper coun ties are supplied, pretty generally, with preachers of the latter description, and also with many baptist ministers ; but the greater part of the state is not furnished with ministers of any denomination. It seems to have been the design of the legislature, as far as possible, to unite their literary concerns, and pro vide for them in common, that the whole might feel the NO. XXII. 3 T"], [530, "508 UNITED STATES OF A.MERICA. benefit, aud no part be neglected or left a prey to party rage, private prejudices and contentions, and consequent ignorance, their inseparable attendant. For tiiis purpose, the literature of this state, like its policy, appears to be considered as one object, and in the same manner subject to common and general regulation for the good of the whole. The charter containing their present system of education, passed in the year 1785. The institution, thus composed, is denominated the ' University of Georgia.' That this body of literati, to whom is intrusted the direction of the general literature of the state, may not be so detached and independent, as uot to possess the confidence of the state, and in order to secure the atten tion and patronage of the principal officers of government, the governor aud council, the speaker of the house of assembly, and the chief justice ofthe sfate; are associated with the board of trustees, in some of the great and more solemn duties of their office, such as making the laws, appointing the president, settling the property, and insti tuting academies. Thus associated, they are denominated the ' Senate of the University,' and are to hold a stated, annual meeting, at which the governor of the state pre sides. The senate appoint a board of commissioners in each couuty, sor the particular management and direction of the academy, and the other schools in each county, who are to receive their instructions from, and are account able to the senate. The rector of each academy is an officer of the university, to be appointed by the president, and the advice of the trustees, and commissioned under the public seal, and is to attend with the other officers at the annual meeting of the senate, to deliberate on tbe general interests of literature, and to determine on the course of instruction for the year, throughout the univer sity. The president has the general charge and oversight of the whole, and is from time to time to visit them, to examine into their order and performances. A great degree of attention has been paid in Georgia to education ; and very considerable sums have been appropriated to the support of it. The college at Athens is amply endowed, and provision is made for establish ing and keeping up an academy in every county in the state. In the towns there are very good common schools ; but the establishment of these most useful semi- naries throughout the country is yet very defective. It should be mentioned, however, that in this, and in all the southern states, the population is too thin to admit of"], [531, "STATE OF GEORGIA. 509 the establishment of schools upon the plan of the town ships of the northern states, or the parishes in Great Britain. No general character will apply to the inhabitants at large. Collected from different parts of the world, as interest, necessity, or inclination led them, their character and manners must of course partake of all the varieties which distinguish the several states and kingdoms from whence they came. There is so little uniformity, that it is difficult to trace any governiug principles among them. An aversion to labour is too predominant, owing in part to the relaxing heat ofthe climate, and partly to the want of necessity to excite industry. An open and friendly hospitality, particularly to strangers, is an ornamental characteristic ofa great part of this people. Commerce, manufactures, agriculture. \u2014 Cotton and rice are the staple commodities of the state, and Savannah being the only shipping port in it, is, of course, the gene- ral mart for the disposal of these articles. But besides the two staples, there are likewise exported, tobacco, indigo, lumber, naval stores, leather, deer and other skins, furs, snake root, myrtle and bees- wax, sago, Indian corn, and live stock. The planters and farmers raise great numbers of cattle, from 1,000 to 1,500 head, and often more. The exports of Georgia in the year 1755, amount- ed to 69,973 dollars; in 1772, to 540,786; in 1793, to 501,383; in 1796, to 950,158; in 1801, to 1,854,951; and in 1817, 8,790,714; of which only to the amount of 259,883 dollars was foreign produce. In return for her exports this state receives West India goods, teas, wines, clothing, and dry goods of all kinds. From the northern states, cheese, fish, potatoes, apples, cider, boots, shoes, &c. The manufactures of Georgia have hitherto been very inconsiderable, with the exception of indigo, silk, and sago. In the year 1766, upwards of 1,0001b. of raw silk were exported ; but so large a quantify has not been ex- ported in any one year before or since. The culture of silk and the manufacture of sago is at present but litile at- tended to. In the interior of the country nearly all the people are clothed in homespun. In almost every family a cotton manufactory is to be seen, and in several in- stances, they have introduced spinning, upon a pretty large scale, by jennies. Many of the females spin cotton all the year round, and get the yarn made into every"], [532, "510 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. article necessary for family use; such as shirting, sheeting, toweling, table-cloths, gowns, petticoats, aprons, caps, pantaloons, vesting, and summer coats for the men's use; besides sofa-cfottis, fringes, tassels, hosiery, &c. The articles made in this manner are substantial aud durable, many of them handsome ; and in all probability the trade will increase te nearly the total exclusion of foreign manu factures from this state. The agriculture of Georgia differs little from that of the Carolinas, except it be in a more extensive growth of the cotton plant, for which the soil and climate are admirably adapted. Formerly, cotton was planted here only by the poorer class of people, and that only for family use. They raised only two kinds, the annual and the West Indian ; the former is low, aud planted every year ; the balls are large and the wool long, perfectly white, and strong. The latter is a tall perennial plant, the stalk somewhat shrubby, several of which rise up from the root for many years successively, the stems of the for mer year being killed by the winter frosts. The balls of the West India cotton are not quite so large as the other ; but the wool is long, extremely sine, silky and white. A plantation of this kind will last several years, with mode rate labour and care. The culture of cotton is now much more attended to than formerly ; many indigo planters having converted their plantations into cotton fields ; aud especially since a new species of cotton plant has been introduced from the island of Waitahoo, one of the Marquesas, in the South Pacific ocean : the wool of this kind is of a very fine texture, and has proved a great acquisition not only to Georgia, but to the other southern states. Constitution. \u2014 The civil government is vested in an assembly, consisting of a senate and house of representa tives, a governor, and a judiciary. The assembly are <>leeted annually, by all citizens and inhabitants of the state, of the age of twenty-one years or upwards, who have paid all taxes which have been lawfully demanded from them for the last year, and who have resided six months in the counties for which the\\r vote. The governor is appointed by the legislature, for two years only The judges are also elected by the legislature, for three years. The constitution provides, that \" arts and sciences shall be promoted, in one or more seminaries of learning; and the legislature shall give such further donations and privi-"], [533, "511 STATE OF GEORGIA. leges to those already established, as may be necessary to secure the objects of their institution.\" The state con stitution was adopted in 1789: Georgia now sends two senators and four representatives to the general congress of the United States. History. \u2014 The first settlement of Georgia by a British colony, in the year 1732, has been already noticed in page 4. The promoters of this settlement were certainly actuated by humane and generous sentiments; yet the imagination of man could scarcely have framed worse re gulations sor the government of the infant colony. The people seut out were poor and unfortunate, therefore they were to be provided with necessaries at the public store ; and they received their lands upon condition of cultiva tion, and, by their personal residence, of defence. Silk and wine being the chief articles intended to be raised, the trustees for Georgia conceived that negroes were not necessary for these purposes. Rum was indeed pernicious to health, and ruinous to new settlers, she importation of it was therefore prohibited; and a free trade' with the Indians was considered as having a tendency to involve the people in quarrels with the powerful savages, and ex pose them to danger and destruction. Such were, probably, the motives which induced the benevolent founders of this colony to impose such absurd and ruinous restrictions on the settlers ; who soon found that abundance of land could be obtained in America upon much better terms, and without any such prohibi tions. By interdicting the use of negroes, the trustees rendered it impracticable, in such a climate, to make any impression on the thick forests, Europeans being utterly unqualified for the heavy task. By not allowing a trade with the West Indies, the colonists were not only deprived ofa good market for their lumber, of which they had abundance on their lands, but also of the essential article ofrum, which, when mixed with water, has been found by experience the most refreshing, and the cheapest drink for workmen in such a foggy and burning climate. The trustees, like other distant legislators, who framed their regulations upon principles of speculation, were liable to many errors and mistakes, and however good their design, their rules were found improper and impracticable. The Carolinians plainly perceived that they would prove in surmountable obstacles to the progress and prosperity of the colony, and therefore from motives of pity, began to"], [534, "512 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. invite the poor Georgians to come over Savannah river, and settle in Carolina, being convinced that they could never succeed under such impolitic and oppressive restric tions. After the representation and memorial from the legis- lature of Carolina had reached Britain, the nation con- sidered Georgia to be of the utmost importance to the British settlements in America, and began to make still more vigorous efforts for its speedy population. The first embarkations of poor people from England, being collect- ed from towns and cities, were found equally idle and nseless members of society abroad, as they had been at home. An hardy and bold race of men, inured to rural labour and fatigue, they were persuaded, would be much better adapted both for cultivation and defence. To find men possessed of these qualifications, they turned their eyes to GermanyT and the Highlands of Scotland, and re- solved to send over a number of Scottish and German labourers to their infant province. When they published their terms at Inverness, an hundred and thirty High- landers immediately accepted them, and were transported to Georgia. A township on the river Altamaha, which was considered as the boundary between the British and Spanish territories, was allotted for the Highlanders, on which dangerous situation they settled, and built a town which they called New Inverness. About the same time 170 Germans embarked with James Oglethorpe, and were fixed in another quarter ; so that, in the space of three years, Georgia received above 400 British subjects, and about 170 foreigners. Afterwards several adventurers, both from Scotland and Germany, followed their country- men, and added further strength to the province, and the trustees flattered themselves with the hopes of soon seeing it in a promising condition. Their hopes, however, were vain. Their injudicious regulations and restrictions, the wars in which they were involved with the Spaniards and Indians, aud the frequent insurrections among themselves, threw the colony info a state of confusion and wretchedness, too great for human nature loug to endure. Their oppressed situation was re- presented to the trustees by repeated complaints ; till at length, finding that the province languished under their care, and weary with the complaints of the people, they, in the year 1752, surrendered their charter to the king, and it was made a royal government. In consequence of which, his majesty appointed John Reynolds, an officer of the navy, governor of the province, and a legislature, similar"], [535, "513 STATE OF GEORGIA. to that of the other royal governments in America, was established in it. Great had been the expense which the mother country had already incurred, besides private be nefactions for supporting this colony; and small had been the returns yet made by it. The vestiges of cultivation was scarcely perceptible iu the forests, and in England all commerce with it was despised. At this time the whole annual exports of Georgia did not amount to \u00a310,000 sterling. Though the people were now favoured with the same liberties and privileges enjoyed by their neighbours under the royal care, yet several years elapsed before the value of the lands in Georgia was known, and that spirit of industry broke out in it, which afterwards diffused its happy influence over the country. In the year 1740, the Rev. George Whitfield founded an orphan-house academy in Georgia, about twelve miles from Savannah. For the support of this, in his itinera tions, he collected large sums of money of all denomina tions of Christians, both in England and America. A part -of this money was expended in erecting proper buildings to accommodate the students, and a part in supporting them. In 1768, it was proposed that the orphan-house should be erected into a college. Whereupon Mr. Whit field applied to tbe crown for a charter, which would have been readily granted, on condition that the president should, in all successions, be an episcopalian ofthe church of England. Several letters passed between the archbishop of Canterbury and Mr. Whitfield on the subject, in which the archbishop insisted on this condition. But Mr. Whit field, though himself an episcopalian, declined it, alleging to his grace, that it would be unjust to limit that office to any particular sect, when tbe donations for the foundation of the institution had been made and entrusted to him, by the various religious denominations, both in England and America. In consequence of this dispute, the affair ofa charter was given up, and Mr Whitfield made his assign ment of the orphan-house in trust to the countess of Huntingdon. Mr. Whitfield died at Newbury Port, in New England, in October, 1770, in the 56th year of his age, and was buried under the presbyterian church in that place. Soon after his death, a charter was granted to his insti tution in Georgia, and the Rev. Mr. Percy was appointed president of the college. Mr. Percy accordingly went over to execute his office, but, unfortunately, on the 30th of May, 1775, the orphan-house building caught fire, and was entirely consumed, except the two wings, which are"], [536, "514 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. still remaining. The American war soon after came on, and put every thing into confusion, and the funds have ever since lain in an unproductive state. From the time Georgia became a royal government, in 1752, till the peace of Paris in 1763, she struggled under many difficulties, arising from the want of credit, from friends, and the frequent molestation of enemies. The good effects of peace were sensibly felt in the province of Georgia. From this time it began to flourish, under the fatherly care of governor Wright. To form a judg ment of the rapid growth of the colony, we need only attend to its exports; which have been already given. During the revolutionary war, Georgia was over-run by the British troops, and the inhabitants were obliged to flee into the neighbouring states for safety. The suffer ings and losses of her citizens were as great, in propor tion to their numbers and wealth, as in any of the states. Since the peace, in 1783, the progress of the population of this state has been astonishingly rapid."], [537, "wnww 9f THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. JFESTERN AND SOUTHWESTERN STATES ANB TERRITORIES.

The Ohio forms the south-eastern boundary of the state, from Georgetown in Pennsylvania, to the mouth of the Great Miami, a distance of 412 miles by the windings of the river, viz. from Georgetown to Big Sandy river, the Ohio river divides Virginia from the state of Ohio ; and from the mouth of Big Sandy river to that of the Great 3 v"], [538, "516 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. Miami, it separates Kentucky from the state of Ohio. That part of this beautiful stream wliich we are now describing, contains the most pleasing part of its scenery, and the most fertile of its shores. It is in reality diffi cult to conceive of any river in the world winding through a valleyT more rich in the bounties of nature, or more elegantly chequered with hill and dale ; and many charming islands contribute not a little to the beauty of the scene. In a distance of upwards of 400 miles, not one bend of the river but what presents a new landscape entirely different from auy other. The bottoms are from a quarter to a mite wide, having generally a perceptible slope backwards to the base of the hills. There are various modes of travelling on this river, which the traveller must attend to, according to the state of the weather. In spring and fall the river is high, and can be navigated with ease by any vessel ; the spring freshes commence about the end of February, and con tinue for upwards of three months: in the fall, the water begins to rise in October, and continues high till near the end of December ; but considerable variations take place in different years, according to the wetness or dryness of the seasons. The principal vessels used for descending the Ohio are canoes, Kentucky and New Orleans boats, keel-boats, barges, and latterly, steam-boats. Canoes are the most simple of all vessels, and consist ofa large log of wood shaped into a long boat, and ex cavated in the middle, so as to accommodate passengers and their baggage ; these sell from one to three dollars each. Skiffs are buill of all sizes, and used with or with- out sails, and can be had from five to thirty dollars. Kentucky and New Orleans boats are flats, with sides boarded like a house, about six or seven feet high, over which there is an arched roof. They are of various sizes, but generally large enough to contain 400 barrels of flour; and sell from 4s. 6d. to 6s. 9d. sterling a foot in length. Keel-boats are constructed to draw but little water, are strongly manned, and ply both upwards and downwards ; next to the steam-boats, they are the best passage vessels on the Ohio. Barges are well known, and also sail up and down the river ; but they are principally used below Cincinnati and the falls of Louisville. Steam-boats have been already described, pages 377 and 382, and those employed upon the western rivers are nothing inferior in convenience and elegant accommodation, though several of them are much larger in size ; one in particular, measur ing 700 tons burden."], [539, "517 STATE OF OHIO. The Great Miami waters a large portion of this state; it is 200 yards wide at its mouth, but 75 miles in the inte rior it is contracted to thirty yards, though it is navigable for canoes fifty miles above this, in all 125 miles : its entire length is about 130 miles, above 100 of which are among the settlements. It is bounded by some ofthe finest lauds in the state, has a brisk curreut, pure water, aud affords numerous mill-seats. Little Miami rises iu Green county, iu this state, and after running upwards of 120 miles, by the windings of the river, enters the Ohio seven miles above Cincinnati, and at high water is 150 yards wide. Its course is nearly parallel with the Great Miami, being no where more than twenty mites distant. The chanuel of this river is very precipitous, affording au immense number of mill-seats; many of which are already improved : two or three paper mil's are erected ou its banks. The S'-ioto river falls iuto the Ohio at the town of Ports- mouth, 393 miles (by water) below Pittsburgh, and 132 above Cincinnati. It is navigable for large keel-boats to Columbus, nearly 200 miles from its mouth, with a portage of only sour miles to the Sandusky, a boatable water which falls into lake Erie. Towards the source of the Scioto the country is marshy, in the middle level, with much fertile soil ; towards the Ohio the country becomes very hilly and broken. The Hockhocking rises in Fairfield county, in this state, and enters the Ohio at the town of Troy, 190 miles (by the river) above the Scioto, and is uav igable to Athens, forty miles from its mouth, for large keel-boats: six miles above Athens are rapids which prevent the ascent of boats. The Maskingu m rises near the Cayahoga river of lake Erie, and falls into the Ohio 195 miles (by water) below Pittsburgh, where it is 250 yards wide. It is navigable for large keels to the Three Legs, 110 miles from its mouth, and from thence for small boats to within a few miles of the Cayahoga. The current ofthe Muskingum and all its branches is very rapid. Several large creeks water that part of the slate lying between the Muskingum and the Pennsylvania boundary line ; such as Will's creek, Pawpaw, Little Muskingum, Wheeling, Capteena, Stoney, and Sunfish creeks. The following streams water the northern portion ofthe state, and pay their tribute to lake Erie. Miami-of-the-lakes, rises in tbe Indian country, and is formed by the junction of the St. Mary's and Little St. Joseph's ; it is 165 miles in length, aud is navigable for"], [540, "518 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. large boats throughout its whole extent, and for vessels of sixty tons to the rapids at Fort Meigs, eighteen miles from its mouth in Miami bay. At these rapids fish swarm in such prodigious quantities, that they are often killed with sticks and stones, and even caught with the hands. The lands which are watered by this stream are represented to be extremely fertile ; much of the surface, however, is either priarie or marsby. The Sandusky rises in the same swamp with the Scioto, and flows north sixty miles into Sandusky bay. This river receives but few tributaries, and is a very rapid stream, little impeded by shoals or falls ; the land which it waters is a great part priarie, and much of it marshy. The other rivers falling into lake Erie are tbe Touissant, Portage river, Huron, Vermillion, Black river, Chagrin, Rocky river, Ashtibula, Conneaut, and Grand river ; but they have little to distinguish them from each other, and nothing to render a particular description necessary. Aspect of the country, soil, &c. \u2014 The face ofthe country will be noticed in describing the several counties ; it will therefore only be necessary here to observe, that through out the state of Ohio there are no mountains, but border ing on the Ohio river the land is extremely hilly and broken. Most of these hills have a deep, rich soil, and are capable of being cultivated to their very summits; and they abound iu coal, lying in horizontal strata. Except coal, this state does not appear to be very rich in minerals ; salt springs have been found upon Scioto, some of which are now in operation. Iron has been discovered near the river Ohio in many places, and limestone of ex cellent quality abounds ; the most abundant rock, how ever, is sandstone slate, which may be considered the basis of the whole country. The bottoms of the Ohio are of very unequal width ; the bases of some of the hills approach close to the river, while others recede to the distance of two or three miles. There are usually three bottoms, rising one above the other like the glacis ofa fortification : and they are heavily timbered with such trees as denote a very fertile soil. The hills are also covered with oak, chesnut, sugar maple, &c. In such parts of these bottoms as have been cleared and settled, the soil is uniformly fertile in a high degree ; producing in great abundance wheat, Indian corn, rye, oats, barley, and indeed every product necessary to human subsistence, that the climate will admit. Fruits are also produced in"], [541, "519 STATE OF OHIO. great quantity, and of excellent qualify, particularly apples and peaches ; many of the former will measure eighteen inches in circumference, and the Ohio bottoms are supposed to produce the latter fruit jn greater perfec tion than auy other part of North America. Id the western counties, and in the north-western and northern portions of the state, there is a leveller surface, and a moister soil, iuterspersed with tracts of dry priarie, and forests ofa sandy or gravelly soil. The north-western corner of the state contains a considerable district of level, rich land, too wet and swampy to admit of healthy settle ments : the soil is a black, loose, friable loam, or a vege table mould, watered by sluggish and dark-coloured streams. Civil divisions, towns, population, &c. \u2014 This state is divided into ten districts, and forty-eight counties, con taining, by the census of 1815, 322,790 inhabitants. In 1817, the population was calculated at 380,000, of whom 61,938 were enrolled in the militia. Bosh the foregoing accounts fall much short, no doubt, of the actual numbers at the times assumed. In describing some of the western states by counties, with a view to afford the fullest information on that por tion of the United States towards which the attention of all Europe is now directed, the geographical order has been adopted in preference to an alphabetical arrange ment. The county of Hamilton, being the oldest settled part of the state, will be first described : those Counties which have not much unsettled land, to invite the atten tion of emigrants, will be briefly noticed. Hamilton County is situated in the south-western cor ner of tbe state, has the Ohio river south, Clermont county east, Butler, north, and the state of Indiana west. It is about thirty miles long, and twenty wide, and is watered by the Ohio, Whitewater, Great and Little Miami, Mill, Deer, Taylor's and Dryfork creeks, and contained by the census, 18,700 inhabitants. It has a hilly surface in the vicinity of the large streams ; in other parts it is level or gently waving: the valleys are broad and rich, and generally cultivated. \u2014 The price of unimproved land is from ten to twenty-five dollars ; cultivated farms near Cincinnati, from thirty to seventy. Mills are numerous on Mill Creek and the Little Miami. There are few un settled lands in this state, and those are of a second quality. Cincinnati is the chief town, which from its present im-"], [542, "520 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. portance, and certainty of future grandeur, deserves -a minute description. There are, besides, the villages of Columbia, Reading, Newtown, Montgomery, Springfield, Colerain, Harrison, Crosby, and Cleves. Cincinnati, at present the largest town in the state of Ohio, is situated on the north bank of the Ohio river, twenty-two miles above the mouth of the Great Mia. ii, in 39\u00b0 6' N. lat. and V 20' W. long. Its distance (by la. i ) from Pittsburgh is 300 miles, from Baltimore 4U0, Lexing- ton 85, Chilicothe 93, Louisville 105, and New Orte.ins (by water) 1666. The site of the town is elevated from 70 to 120 feet above low water mark, and is never over- flowed ; the streets are sixty-six feet wide, crossing each other at right angles, and the greater part of the houses being of brick, make a very handsome appearance. This flourishing town was laid out about thirty years ago ; in July, 1815, the number of public buildings and dwelling- houses was 1,100, and the population estimated at 6,000. In June, 1817, the buildings had augmented to 1,300, and the inhabitants to 8,000 ; and by the Scioto Gazette it appears, that in April, 1819, the population had been re- turned at upwards of 10,000! The astonishing progress of this place is au abridgment of the history of improve- ment in the western country. The public buildings are spacious and elegant ; several denominations of Christians have splendid houses for pub- lic worship ; the most remarkable are those possessed by the baptists, presbyterians, methodists, and quakers- But the building in Cincinnati that most deserves the attention of strangers, and which on review must excite the best feelings of human nature, is the Lancaster school-hou^e. This edifice consists of two wings, one of which is appro- priated to boys, the other to girls. In less than two weeks after the school was opened, upwards of 400 children were admitted, several of them belonging to some of the most respectable families in the town; the building will accommodate 1,100 scholars. To the honour of the in- habitants of Cincinnati, upwards of 12,000 dollars were subscribed by them towards defraying the expenses of this benevolent undertaking. Amongst the many objects that must arrest the attention and claim the admiration of the traveller, there is none that can deserve his regard more than this praise-worthy institution. Virtue, science, and the principles of social life, are now taught, where thirty years since stood a forest; or if the human form or habitation made their appearance, it was the species in its rudest state of savage life. Here are also three brick mar-"], [543, "521 STATE OF OHIO. ket-houses. in which are exposed, four days in the week, every uecessary, and many luxuries of life. Provisions are from ten to fifteen per cent, cheaper than at Pitts burgh ; the following were the rates of the market (Eng lish money) in the last week of May, I S 1 9 : beef. _|rf. to 3\\d. per lb. ; pork, 2\\d. ; bacon, bd. 'to Id. ; butter, 9i_. to 16d. ; cheese, Q\\d. to lQd. ; sugar (maple) 9d. ; venison hams, each, lbd. to 27<_ ; potatoes, per bushel, 16d. te 21d.; fowls, per dozen, bs.

A\\d. House rent for a mechanic is about sixty dollars ; but the most of them soon get houses of their own. Women servants are paid 20s. 3d. fo 2.9s. 3d., and men ditto, 63s. to 72s. per month, besides fheir board and lodging. Mechanics' board and lodging per week, 13s. Qd. to 18s. The wages of a me chanic, in all trades, vary from 36s. to 40s. 6d. per week. Tailors, shoemakers, carpenters, blacksmiths, masons, and saddlers, are the best trades; next tinmen, bakers, and hatters ; printers are third-rate ; and for weavers no employment. Wearing apparel is here very expensive : a superfine blue cloth coat will cost, \u00a32 18s. 6d. to \u00a33 7s. 6d. a yard ; making a coat 27s. ; hats, 31s. Qd, to Abs. ; shoes, 13s. Qd. to lbs. 9d. a pair ; Wellington boots, 36s. to 40s. 6d. ; Hessian ditto, 49s. Qd. to 54s.\u2014 The gene ral average of the rent of a good house, well situated for business, is from \u00a390 to \u00a3130 per annum : taxes almost nothing. Au enormous stone building is erected on the bank of the Ohio as a steam manufactory, which cost 120,000 dol lars; it is nine stories high, in all 110 feet, and intended for making flour and oil, and also for a fulling mill. The machinery is driven by an engine of seventy horse power, and when in complete operation will grind 700 barrels of flour weekly. A steam saw-mill is also erected, and a large building has been raised by the Cincinnati manu facturing company, for the execution of their operations. Besides the cotton and woollen manufactory, which carries 3,300 spindles for cotton and 400 for woolten, there are four cotton spinning establishments, which contaiu together about 1,500 spindles. In the winter of 1815, a woollen manufactory commenced, which produces sixty yards of broad cloth per day; and wool-carding and cloth-dressing are performed in several places. There are also two extensive rope-walks, two glass-houses, which produce. window glass, hollow ware, and white flint glass,"], [544, "522 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. a sugar refinery, aud two or three breweries, which in the year 1816, consumed 40,000 bushels of barley. A found ery for iron castings has lately been established, and a white and red lead manufactory that produces six tens weekly. There are three banks in Cincinnati, and two printing-offices, each of which publishes a weekly news paper nearly equal in number, viz. 1,500 copies: several respectable books have been printed. The Cincinnati university is a mere nominal institution ; at present it lan guishes in embryo. The public library contains upwards of 8,000 volumes, among which are many valuable works. The \" School of Literature and the Arts,\" is principally composed of young men, and promises to become the nurse of genius and taste. The exports of Cincinnati consist of flour, corn, beef, pork, butter, lard, bacon, peach brandy, beer and porter, pot and pearl ashes, cheese, soap and candles, hats, hemp, ropes, saddles, rifles, cherry-tree and black ash boards, staves and scantlings, cabinet furniture, chairs, &c. East Indian and European goods are imported from Baltimore and Philadelphia, by the way of Pittsburgh. Lead is pro cured from St. Louis, and rum, sugar, molasses, aud dry goods, are received in steam-boats and keels from New Orleans. Salt is easily obtained from the Kenhaway salt works, and coal (of which vast quantities are consumed) is brought down the Ohio from Pittsburgh and Wheeling, in flat-bottomed boats. In short, Cincinnati shares with Pittsburgh the commerce of tbe whole valley of Ohio ; the former is to the Mississippi what the latter is to Balti more, New York, and Philadelphia. If any calculation could be hazarded upon the progress of either, it might perhaps be justifiable to predict, that for a great length of time, these two prosperous towns will bear very nearly the same relation to each other that they do at present- The price of town lots in Cincinnati is high ; those in Maiu, First, and Second streets sell for more than 200 dollars a soot, measuring on the front line. Those pos sessing less local advantages are sold from 50 to 10 dol lars ; out-lots and lauds adjoining the town, bring from 500 to 1,000 dollars an acre. Farms above and below the creeks, and beyond the range of hills on the north, sell for 50, 80, and 100 dollars an acre, according to quality and proximity to the town. Vast remains of ancient fortifica tions, embankments, stone walls, earthen mounds, the latter containing rude stone coffins filled with human bones, have been discovered within the precincts of this town; and many curious articles dug up, composed of"], [545, "523 STATE OF OHIO. jasper, rock crystal, cannel-coal, copper, sculptural re presentations on different substances, &c. &c. ; altogether tending to prove that this country was formerly inhabited by a race of men very different from the present American Indians. Butler County lies north of Hamilton, south of Pre ble, east of the state of Indiana, and west of Warren county, and is about 24 miles square. It is watered by the Great Miami, and also by several handsome creeks, such as Dryfork, running into Whitewater ; Indian creek, Four-mile creek, Seven-mile creek, Elk, and Dick's creek, running into the Great Miami. The soil of two-thirds of this county is fertile ; but there are tracts of poor land to the south-east and north-west. Hamilton, the seat of justice, is situated twenty-five miles north-east of Cincinnati, on the east bank of the Miami. Its site is elevated and beautiful: it has about seventy-five buildings, principally of wood ; a post-office, and a printing-office issuing a weekly newspaper, entitled, the \"Miami Intelligencer.\" In 1816, there were 2,877 male inhabitants, over twenty-one years of age in this county Oxford, stands near the northern confines of the county, has few houses, but in time will probably become a re spectable town, as a college is to be established in it, ac cording to the provisions of a law passed in 1810. This seminary is endowed with an entire township of land, which has been chiefly leased to settlers ; the leases extend to ninety-nine years, renewable for ever. Preble County is bounded on the south by Butler, east by Montgomery, north by Darke, and west by Indiana. It is twenty-four miles long and eighteen wide, and is watered by the head branches of Four and Seven-mile creeks, Franklin creek, Bushy fork, Twin creek, and small branches of the north fork of White water, all affording excellent mill seats. The surface of this county is pretty level, soil rich and highly productive ; timber, poplar, ash, black walnut of great size, and some oak. This county contains some valuable tracts of unsold United States land. Eaton, is the chief town ; it is situated near the site of old Fort St. Clair, on a beautiful plain, inclined to the south, and watered by Seven-mile creek. It has about thirty-five houses, stone jail, and a post-office ; and is distant from Cincinnati about sixty miles, in a northern direction. Darke County is bounded on the south by Preble, east 3x"], [546, "524 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. by Miami county, north by Indian lands, and east by Indiana, being thirty miles long and twenty-four wide, and is watered by Panther, Greenville and Still-water creeks, and by the river Mississinway ; surface level, soil rich, but wet in places: barrens and priaries abound in the north-western parts, timber, principally oak ; but walnul, sugar maple, buckeye, &c. are common on the bottoms, and large tracts of vacant land, belonging to the United States. The sites of old forts Jefferson, Recovery, and Greenville, are in this county : the last has been fixed on as the county seat ; at present it is only a village of cabins, but the population is rapidly augmenting. Miami County, has Montgomery south, Champaign east, Indian lands north, and Darke on the west. It is about thirty miles in length, and twenty broad ; and is abundantly watered by the Great Miami, which divides it from north to south ; by the South-west, or Still-water branch, Panther and Greenville creeks ; Loramie's creek, and Fawn, Lost, and Honey creeks; the surface is level, soil moist and rich. Troy, the seat of justice for Miami county, stands on the west side of the Great Miami, twenty miles above Dayton, and seventy-two north of Cincinnati. It has a post-office and a public library. The site of this town is a handsome plain, which, however, terminates in swamps, about one mile from the rear ofthe town. Piqua-town, is a post-town, situated on the west bank of the Miami river of Ohio, in the county of Miami ; and although not the seat of justice, is by far the place of the greatest notoriety and importance within the county. This is owing to the beauty of its situation, being the site of the old town of the Shawan\u0153se Indians, who named it after one of their principal tribes, viz. the Piqua tribe. The falls of the river at the town, afford many sites for water-works. The Shawan\u0153se were routed and driven from this place, about the year 1780, by the Kentuckians. It is seventy-seven miles north from Cincinnati, and about eighty miles west from Columbus, the permanent seat of government for the state. The country around Piqua is settled by emigrants, chiefly from Pennsylvania, New- Jersey, and Kentucky ; they are an industrious, moral, and religious people ; and many of them possessed of con siderable wealth. Religious denominations are methodists, presbyterians, seceders, baptists, and new-lights. The country is healthy and fruitful, abounding with springs of the purest water. The lands generally of the first quality. All the unsold lands belong to the United States, and"], [547, "525 STATE OF OHIO. they are to be purchased at the land office in Cincinnati, at two dollars per acre. A whole section, or half, or a quarter, may be purchased ; but the government will not dispose of a lesser quantity than a quarter section, or 160 acres. When the land is paid for, patents issue from the department of State, signed by the president, and return ed to the land office, where the claimants will receive them, on paying the postage from the seat of government. These titles are of the best kind, entirely safe and indisputable. In every township there is one section of public land set apart for the support of schools. No country can offer greater inducements to the industrious, enterprising emi grant, if we regard the soil, the climate, the low price of lands, the goodness of the title, aud certain prospect of a market for the surplus produce ; for the outlet to the sea is both ways, viz. by the lakes and the Ohio. Improved land sells from four to twenty-five dollars an acre. As iu all new countries, manufactures are in their infancy, all the handicraft arts of the first necessity aro in use. The farmers in a great degree manufacture their own clothing. Sheep are found to answer well, and there are great numbers for a new country: Half-blood and quarter Merinoes are common. Great numbers of horned castle and hogs are raised and drove to market. The price of produce in the year 1817, as follows: Indian corn, 18rf. per bushel ; wheat, 3s. 4|_.. ; buck wheat, Is. S^d. ; oats, 18d. ; pork, \u00a31 Os. 3d. per hundred; beef, 15s. 9c?. per ditto ; whisky, 2s. 9\\d. per gallon ; a good milch cow, \u00a33 7s . 6d. ; a good working horse, \u00a39; sheep, lbs. 9d. each ; butter, 6\\d. per lb. ; cheese, 6\\d. ; flour for market, \u00a31 9s. 3d. per barrel. In the county of Miami there are no slaves, and very few free blacks. Slavery in every shape is prohibited throughout the state : and the laws interdict the residence of free blacks, unless under very special circumstances. There is not any prospect that the constitution of this state will ever be altered so as to allow of slavery. In this county there have been several new towns laid off: none are improved but Piqua and Troy. The latter is the seat of justice, seven miles lower down on the same side of the Miami. Having been located in a low situation, contiguous to swamps and marshes, it has proved sickly, and does not offer ever to become a place of any import ance. The average produce of lands in this eounty, is about as follows : corn, fifty bushels to the acre; wheat, twenty five bushels ; oats, twenty bushels; hemp grows remark-"], [548, "526 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. ably well, but there is little raised. Crops of hay are very heavy, aud the country is well adapted to grass of all kinds In the land district of Cincinnati, there remains yet to be sold, about a million and a half of acres. These lands lie chiefly in the counties of Champaign, Miami, and Darke. These three counties extend northward to the Indian boundary. Persons purchasing, for prompt pay ment, reduces the price to one dollar and a half an acre. A- discount of eight per cent, is allowed on all payments made before they are due. The lands still owned and oc cupied by the Indians, within the limits of this state, be long to the Wyandots, Shawan\u0153se, and Ottowas. Civi lized habits are making some progress among these Indians. The society of Friends (first in every good work) are the chief agents in this benevolent undertaking; and, proba bly, from their correct habits, they are better qualified for the task than any other people. There are many ancient fortifications near to Piqua. The present race of Indians are entirely ignorant of the cause or time of their erection. Some of these forts are of great extent, and some of them so small that they do not enclose more than half an acre. The excavations are all from the inside, and the entrance into them from the north. The ditches of some of them, are at this time six feet high above the surface of the surrounding grounds; some of them are constructed in masses of gravel and stone where it would have been extremely difficult if not altogether impracticable to erect them without the aid of iron tools. \u2014 There is one which eucloses about seventeen acres; it is of a circular form, the walls all round in part built of stone. The stone for she purpose, have been car ried from the river, about 600 yards distant- The trees on all these forts, are as large as those in the surrounding forests; and hence the conjecture, that the forts are not less than 400 years standing. They can be traced south and south-west, to the Floridas ; but not beyond this county due north. Montgojiery County lies south of Miami, north of parts of Butler and Warren, east of Preble, and west of Green. It is twenty-four miles long and twenty-two wide. The Great Miami runs through it from north to south, near its western boundary. The Stillwater branch waters the north-west corner, for about fourteen miles, on a direct line ; Mad river winds five or six miles through the eastern side of the county, before entering the Miami, a little above Dayton. Besides these there are Franklin,"], [549, "527 STATE OF OHIO. Bear, and Wolf creeks from the west, and Hole's creek from the east; all entering the Great Miami. The sur face is uneven, consisting of rich hills and narrow valleys, except on the large streams, where there are wide and valuable bottoms, particularly on Mad river. The upland is heavily timbered, aud equal to any in the state. There yet remain valuable tracts of public lands to be entered. Dayton, is handsomely situated on the east bank ofthe Great Miami, a little below the confluence of the Mad river and Still-water, and is at present the seat of justice. It was planned and surveyed under the direction of gene ral Wilkinson, in 1796, whose title failed. The present proprietor is Daniel G. Cooper, who has given eight lots for county purposes, schools and churches. The public buildings are a court-house, methodist meeting-house, presbyterian church, academy, and library; a bank called the \" Dayton Manufacturing Company,\" with a capital of 100,000 dollars ; a post-office, and a printing-office, issuing a weekly newspaper, entitled the \" Ohio Republican.\" A bridge is about to be erected over the mouth of Mad river. There are about 130 dwelling houses, besides mechanics' shops ; and several grain and saw mills near the town, at the mouth of Mad river, and on Wolf creek. Dayton is the largest village between the Miamis, except Cincinnati. Near the mouth of Hole's creek, on a plain, are the re mains of ancient works, of great extent. Oue of the embankments incloses about 160 acres, and the walls are in some parts nearly twelve feet high. Warren County is situated south of Montgomery and a part of Green, north of parts of Hamilton and Clermont, west of Clinton, and east of Butler. It is traversed by the Little Miami, from north-west to south-east ; together with the numerous tributary creeks and rivers ; the largest of which are Todd's and Cesar's creeks, running into the Little Miami from the east ; Turtle creek from the west, and Dick's and Clear creeks, flowing into the Great Miami. The surface of this county is happily waving, being no where too hilly to admit of convenient cultiva tion, or so level as to become wet and marshy : its south em half has generally a thin soil, and oak timber ; its northern, is equal in fertility to any land in the state, and is timbered with poplar, sugar maple, black walnut, bass wood, blue ash, &c. Lebanon, the seat of justice, is situated nearly in the centre ofthe county, on the post road, between Cincinnati and Chilicothe, between two branches of Turtle creek, near their junction. It is four miles east of the Little"], [550, "528 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. Miami, and thirty north-east of Cincinnati. Its situation is healthy, and excellent water is obtained at the depth of twenty-five to thirty feet ; building materials, clay, lime, stone, and wood, abundant. It has a court-house, stone jail, baptist and methodist meeting houses, school-house, post-office, printing-office, at which is printed a paper, called the \"Western Spy,\" a public library; a banking association, called the \" Lebanon Miami Banking Com- pany,\" with a capital limited to 250,000 dollars; besides several stores and mechanics' shops. Clermont County is bounded on the south by Ohio river, east by Adams and Highland counties, north by Clinton and Warren, and west by Hamilton. If is large and will probably be divided. It is watered on the west by the Little Miami, which separates it for twelve or fifteen miles from Hamilton ; by the East fork of the Little Miami, Stone Lick and O'Bannon's creeks ; on the south, by the Ohio river, for the distance of forty miles, and by fifteen large creeks, emptying into the same river,, the principal of which are Red Oak creek, which waters the north-east corner ; Straight creek, White Oak creek, very large, heads in Highland county, Bnllskin, Bear, Big Indian, Little Indian, Cross and Muddy creeks. Its southern parts along the Ohio are hilly ; the interior and northern parts level. \u2014 The bottoms of the Ohio iu this county are wide, rich and heavily timbered. The pre vailing timber on the uplands is oak. Williamsburgh, the seat of justice, is situated on the north bank of the East fork of the Little Miami, thirty miles east-north-east of Cincinnati, on the shortest road fo Chilicothe. It is well supplied with water, for mills and domestic use. It has a stone court-house, post-office, and two printing-offices, which issue two weekly newspapers, called the \" Political Censor,\" and \" Western American.\" Clinton County is bounded by Clermont and a part of Highland counties; east by parts of Highland and Fayette; north by Green, and west by Warren. It is about twenty miles long and fifteen wide, and is watered, principally, by branches of Paint creek, running into the Scioto, and Todd's fork of the Little Miami. The surface of this, county is generally level, in some parts marshy ; it con tains much good land, the greater part in a state of nature. Wilmington, the only village deserving mention, is the seat of justice. It is nearly equidistant between Cincinnati and Chilicothe, about fifty miles from each. Green County has Clinton south, Fayette and Madi son east, Champaign and Montgomery west. It is about"], [551, "529 STATE OF OHIO. twenty-sour miles square; and is watered by the Little Miami, which runs iu a trausverse direction through the county, from north-west to south-east ; Mad river waters the south-west comer. Cesar's and Massie's creeks, tribu taries of the Little Miami, from the east, water large por tions of the county. The western side of the county is watered by Sugar, and Big aud Little Beaver creeks.\u2014 The valleys are wide, rich, and productive ; the uplands generally of a second quality, with a portion of oak barrens. Xenia, the seat of justice, is situated nearly in the centre of the couuty, on Shawan\u0153se creek. It is three miles east of the Little Miami, and fifty-five north-east of Cin\u00ab cinnati. It has a brick court-house, an academy and a church ; a post-office and a printing-office, which issues a weekly paper, entitled the \" Ohio Vehicle.\" The situa tion of this infant town is pleasant and healthy. Champaign County lies north of Green, west of Dela ware, south of the Indian lands, and east of Miami county. The Great Miami meanders through its south-western cor- ner, and many of its numerous tributary streams water its southern side. In addition to these there are several rivers and considerable creeks, and numerous rivulets and runs. No county in the state possesses a greater number of fine situations for mills. Its name is a correct index to its sur face ; it has extensive champaign tracts on the east side of Mad river ; on the west side are rich heavy timbered lands, and towards the south-east, barren and swampy prairies. It is, upon the whole, a large and fertile county, and holds out great advantages to emigrants. Urbanna, the county seat, is situated on a large and fer tile prairie, two miles east of Mad river. Two permanent brooks flow through it, aud well water is easily procured. The number of dwelling-houses is upwards of 100, chiefly of wood. It has a post-office, a printing-office, in which is published a paper called the \" Spirit of Liberty,\" and a banking company. Fevers and agues are annual visitants. Timber, clay, and quarries of sandy limestone are very convenient. A few miles below Dayton, are mounds of great eleva tion. Oue, situated upon a prairie, half a mile from the Franklin road, is said to be upwards of 100 feet in height, and 286 feet diameter at the base : the whole mound is covered with large forest trees, and from its summit one has an extensive view ofthe circumjacent country. There is no appearance of the earth having been taken from the surrounding surface."], [552, "530 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. The foregoing described counties of Hamilton, Butler, Preble, Darke, Miami, Montgomery, Warren, Clermont, Clinton, Green, and Champaign, are all watered by the Great and Little Miamis; and which embrace a district about ninety miles in length and sixty broad : this is usually called the \" Miami Country.\" Delaware County has Madison and Pickaway south, Licking and Knox counties east, Indian lands north, and Champaign west. It is finely watered by the Scioto, the Whetstone Fork, Big-belly, Allum, and Walnut creeks ; all large streams, which traverse the county from north to south, parallel with each other, at the distance of from four to ten miles apart. Soil and surface well adapted to all the purposes of cultivation. Improved lands are high, owing to the facility with which produce is transported to market. The chief towns are Delaware, and Norton, on Whetstone creek, and New Baltimore, on the Scioto; all new and thriving villages. Franklin County, situated nearly in the centre ofthe state, has Pickaway south, parts of Fairfield and Licking east, Delaware north, and Madison west. It is finely watered by the Scioto and Whetstone rivers, and several creeks. The surface of this county is gently waving, ex cept aloug the vallies of the streams ; the soil is similar to that of Delaware and Champaign. Columbus, the metropolis of the state of Ohio, is situ ated on the east bank of the Scioto, on an elevated plain of several hundred acres, and of a soil equal in durability to any in the world. It stands in 39c 47' N. lat. and 6\u00b0 If W. long, near the middle ofthe county, and within twenty miles ofthe centre ofthe state, in a fine fertile country. \u2014 To persons in Europe, many of the facts related of the improvements in the western states, particularly those on the river Ohio, must appear almost incredible ; and none certainly can approach the marvellous, and yet be strictly true, more than the history ofthe town of Colum- bus. The lots were first exposed for sale in June, 1812, and the town now (1819) contains upwards of 400 dwel- ling-houses, and about SOOO inhabitants ; five or six schools, a bank, two printing-offices, near twenty mercantile stores, a state-house and government offices, a post-office, and a penitentiary. Situated, as this town is, on a high airy plain, in the centre of large and populous settlements, en joying a safe and convenient navigation, and possessing great political aud local advantages, it cannot fail in time to rival the first cities in the western country. The rise in the price of lots has been rapid, almost without a parallel."], [553, "531 STATE OF OHIO. Lots nearest the public square have sold for 2,000 dollars, and no where in the town for less than 200. Boats often tons burden can ascend to the town for six months in the year ; and in freshes vessels of 200 tons can descend into the river Ohio. \u2014 Columbus is 115 miles from Cincinnati, and 42 from Chilicothe. Pickaway County has Ross on the south, Fairfield east, Franklin north, and parts of Madison and Fayette west; the Scioto runs through this county. The other streams are Deer, and Darby's creek from the west, and Lower Walnut from the east, all large, and emptying into the Scioto. The soil of this county is of the best quality. Pickaway plains which are about twelve miles long and three wide, is a priarie of inexhaustible fertility. Here are to be seen some of the first agricultural prospects in the state. The bottoms of the Scioto are wide and ofthe first quality. The towns are Circleville, Bloomfield, Jefferson, Livingston, and Westfall. Circleville, the seat of justice, is situated on the Pick away bottom, about half a mile east of the Scioto. Its site is two mounds of earth, one circular, and the other square, containing about twenty acres. The first is enclosed by two circumvallations, whose perpendicular height is about fifteen feet above the adjoining ditch. In the centre of the town is a small vacant circle. From this focus the streets diverge in regular radii, intersecting the walls at equal distances. The greater part of the build ings are within the external circle. It contains about 250 buildings, a post-office, court-house of an octagonal form, and thirteen stores, &c. The growth of this town has been rapid, it owes its existence to the wealth of the sur rounding plantations rather than to political causes or commercial advantages. Madison County has Fayette south, Franklin and Pickaway east, Delaware north, and Champaign and Green west. It is watered by the north fork of Paint and Darby's creek. The eastern parts are broken, or mode rately hilly ; especially the dividing ridge between the waters of Paint and Little Miami. Towards the western parts, are priaries and barrens, but the greater part first rate land. It is pretty thickly settled, and has few unseat ed lands inviting to settlers. New- London is the chief town ; it contains about 100 buildings. Fayette County has Highland and Scioto south, Ross and Pickaway east, Madison north, and Green and Clin ton west. It is watered by the north and west forks of no. xxiii. 3 Y"], [554, "532 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. Paint creek, and head branches of Cesar's creek. In soil, surface, and general aspects, it closely resembles Clinton, already described. Washington is the chief town. Highland County has Adams south, Pike east, Ross, Clinton, and Fayette north, and Clermont west. It is copiously watered by forks of Brush and Paint creeks, and by small creeks and brooks running into the East fork of the Little Miami; its surface is generally hilly ; free from stagnant waters or marshes, which insures health to the inhabitants. It is thinly settled, and offers many eligible situations to industrious emigrants. Mounds and old forts are to be seen in many parts of the county. On the head branches of the East fork of the Little Miami, is an ancient work, different in figure to any hitherto discovered. It consists of a square enclo sure, with nine banks of long parapets united at one end, exhibiting very exactly the figure of a gridiron. In this fort most of the gateways are guarded by straight or crescent-formed batteries. Adams County has the Ohio river south, Scioto county east, Highland county north, and Clermont west. It is hilly and broken aloug the Obio, and is watered by Eagle, Brush and Isaac's creeks, and by waters of Paint and Little Miami. It has an uneven surface, rich, deep soil, heavy forests of oak, hickory, sugar maple, black walnut, black elm, and sycamore. Although a populous county, it has yet considerable bodies of unseated lands, belonging to individuals, mostly non-residents. There is an abundant supply of iron on Brush creek. It has several villages. West-union, the seat of justice, is situated on a branch of the East fork of the Little Miami, on the road leading from Limestone, in Kentucky, to Chilicothe. It has about 100 houses, a court-house, jail, printing-office, and post office, six stores, four inns, and a great number of me chanics. The surrounding country is undulating and per fectly healthy, no instance of bilious fever and ague has occurred ; springs and mill seats abundant. Wild lands worth from five to twenty dollars. Manchester, stands on the bank of the Ohio, near the lower end of Massie's island, fifteen miles above Maysville; it is pleasantly situated, commands a view of the Ohio ; but appears stationary ; it has about forty old houses. Adamsville, is situated just below the mouth of Brush creek, and eight miles above Manchester, which it resem bles in appearance and size. Here are fine bottoms, which continue wide for twelve miles above and below the mouth of Brush creek,"], [555, "533 STATE OF OHIO. Scioto County, situated on both sides of the river of the same name, has the Ohio river south, Gallia east, Ross and Pike north, and Adams west. It is watered by the Scioto and Ohio rivers, Little Scioto river, Turkey, Pine, Stout's, Twin's, and Scioto creeks. The bottoms of the Ohio aud Scioto, in this county, are wide, and of the first quality. The hills near the Ohio are covered with white oak and hickory, and generally of a third quality, but suitable to pasturage and wheat. Many unseated bottom tracts could be purchased for six, eight, or ten dollars. Turkey and Pine creeks abound with fine'sites for mills, which are but partially improved. Portsmouth, the seat of justice, stands oii a peninsula formed by the confluence of the Scioto with the Ohio. Its site is pleasant, gently inclining to the south. It con tains about 100 houses, mostly new. The bottoms for many miles above and below the mouth of Scioto, are from one to two miles in width, and as rich as ean be desired. Mounds and walls are numerous ; a wall from four to seven feet high extends from the Great to the Little Scioto, a distance of seven miles. Pike County lies on both sides of the Scioto river; has Scioto county south, Ross east and north, and High land west. It is watered by the Scioto and its tributary creeks and brooks ; the surface is considerably broken ; timber, oak, hickory, and maple ; soil, generally poor, except on tbe bottoms Piketon, situated on the east bank of the Scioto, is the county seat. Mounds are numerous throughout this county. Ross County is situated on both sides of the Scioto, which divides it about equally. It has parts of Scioto and Pike counties south, Athens and Gallia east, Fairfield and Pickaway north, and Fayette and Highland west ; and is watered by Paint creek on the west side of the Scioto ; Kenneeonic and Salt creeks on the east. This is a rich healthy county. The inhabitants are mostly wealthy, and have elegant buildings, large and well improved farms ; the traveller on approaching a farm-house is forcibly struck with the indications of plenty, which are presented at every step ; such as immense fields of grain, large stacks of wheat, capacious corn cribs, well filled even in summer ; numerous herds of stock, cattle, horses, hogs, sheep, com mon and merino ; yards swarming with poultry ; and should he have occasion to enter the hospitable mansion, he will there find the same proofs of abundance and per fect independence ; every thing is on the scale of external"], [556, "534 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. wealth ; a plenteous board, elegant and costly furniture, well dressed children and servants. In short, \" A clean fireside and a jorum,\" and what is better, a friendly welcome, without any of those sour looks and sly watchings of the motion of your knife and fork, too often witnessed in other parts. The above remarks apply to all the rich counties of this state, as well as to those of Kentucky, Tennessee, and Louisiana. Chilicothe, the seat of justice, and formerly ofthe state government, is situated on the west bank of the Scioto, (sixty-six miles from its mouth) on a beautiful and exten sive plain. It is laid out on a large scale, with a great number of out lots attached to it. The plan is regular ; the streets cross each other at right angles, and every square is divided into four parts byr lanes crossing each other also at right angles; the streets are sixty-six feet wide, the alleys sixteen; the lots contain four acres each. It contains about 500 buildings, and about 4,000 inhabitants. It has several stately public buildings, four churches, several rope walks, about forty stores for dry goods, a cotton and woollen factory, besides breweries, distilleries, and tan neries. In short, it is a brisk and elegant town, in the centre of fertile and populous settlements, and surround ed by a great number of handsome and tasty country seats. It has three printing-offices, two issuing weekly news papers, the \"Fredonia,\" and \"Supporter;\" and one for books; a post-office, and a land-office for the disposal of the public lands. Gentlemen of taste would find Chilicothe an agreeable residence. This county has several villages, the principal of which are Bainbridge, Amsterdam, and Adelphi. The valleys of Paint and Scioto, and many ofthe adja cent hills abound with the vestiges of an immense ancient population ; and perhaps, the curious antiquary can no where in the western country find a richer field for his researches. Fairfield County, a large and wealthy interior county, bounded on the north by Licking, east by Muskingum and Washington, south by Athens and Ross, and west by Pick away and Franklin counties. It is thirty-six miles long by thirty broad ; contains 900 square miles, and is divi ded into twenty townships. The villages, regularly laid out and called towns, are, in addition to Lancaster, the county seat, the seven following, namely; Somerset, Clin ton, New-Lebanon, Jacksonville, Greencastle, and Centre ville. This county embraces perhaps the most elevated tract of country, of similar extent between the Muskingum"], [557, "535 STATE OF OHIO. and Scioto rivers. The land is therefore drier, and more peculiarly adapted to the production of wheat and other kinds of grain than that of several adjacent counties. The principal streams are the head-waters of Hockhocking river. Lancaster, a flourishing post town and seat of justice, in the central part of this county. It is handsomely situ ated in Hocking township, near the source of Hockhocking river, on the road leading from Zanesville to Chilicothe. It contains between 100 and 200 houses, and a population of 700 inhabitants. Here are likewise twelve mercantile stores, a handsome brick court-house and jail, a methodist meeting house, a bank, an English aud German printing office, from which are published weekly newspapers in both languages, and a market-house with a market on Wednesday and Saturday. Various kinds of mechanical business are likewise here industriously prosecuted. It is twenty -eight miles south-easterly from Columbus, thirty six south-westerly from Zanesville, and thirty-four north easterly from Chilicothe Lat. 39\u00b0 45' N. Ion. 5\u00b0 35' W. The face of the country about Lancaster presents a peculiar aspect. The land seems generally level ; but abrupt, precipitous, and coni-form piles of rocks, producing very littie timber or herbage, are occasionally interspersed in a promiscuous manner, in every direction. They are of divers altitudes and magnitudes. Some people might perhaps conjecture them to have been works of art, did not their numbers and magnitude preclude the idea. One of these, called Mount Pleasant, about one mile northerly from Lancaster, is very remarkable. It is situated near a large prairie, and encompassed by a wide plain. The south-west front of this huge pile of rocks is about 500 feet in perpendicular height: the base is about a mile and a half in circumference, while the top is but about thirty by 100 yards across it. Licking County has Fairfield county south, Muskingum and Coshocton east, Delaware and Franklin north, and is watered by Licking river and its two forks ; Wakatomika and Walnut creeks, all large and boatable. Wherever we find the traces of former population, as demonstrated by the existence of mounds, fortifications, and ruins of buildings, we are sure to find land of an ex cellent quality. This county is full of antiquities. Newark is a thriving little town situated in the forks of Licking, on the road between Zanesville and Columbus. Granville is also a considerable village. The surface, soil, timber, and water of this county, is inviting to settlers. It"], [558, "536 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. has had a rapid settlement; and presents strong induce ments to emigrants. Athens County has Gallia south, Washington east, Washington and Fairfield north, and Ross west. It is watered by the Great Hockhocking and its branches ; by Racoon, Federal, Shade, and Salt creeks, and au immense number of brooks. Compared to such counties as Ross, Franklin, Pickaway, and Licking, it may be said to be poor, iu soil and improvements. The southern parts, adjoining Gallia county, consist of oak hiils and deep narrow valleys. It is thinly inhabited ; in many places it is from four to twenty miles between houses; but fhis is only true, as it respects the eastern portion. Game is abundant, such as bears, deer, foxes, racoons, &c. Wild turkeys are more numerous in this than in any other part of the state. The range is rich, aud will probably con- tinue so for many years to come. Mounds and embank- ments are to be seen in every part of this county. A/hens is pleasantly situated on the east bank of the Great Hockhocking, on a peninsula formed by a consider- able beud of that river, thirty-seven miles above its con- fluence with the Ohio, and nearly in the centre of the College townships, reserved by congress in the grant te the Ohio company for the endowment of a University. The names of these townships are Athens and Alexander; the last lies on the south side of the river; they contain 46,080 acres. The lands are leased in small farms of from 100 to 160 acres, to applicants sor ever, upon terms never to be altered, the rent of each tract being the interest of the appraised value of the land in a state of nature. The town is laid out in a regular form, and elevated about 100 feet above the bottoms. The soil is a dry rich loam, well adapted for gardens. There are numerous springs of never failing excellent water. The total number of buildings is about 100. There is an academy in a very flourishing state under the instruction of an able teacher, in which are taught all the branches of a liberal education; and a spacious new college is now building. The present revenue of the university is about 2,500 dollars ; the edu- cation of youth is to be gratuitous. The greater part of the college lands are very fertile; but some tracts are broken and ofa thin soil. The settle ments commenced in 1797, and the town and county of Athens have proved unusually healthy. Many of the settlers are from New-England, who affirm that sickness had rarely visited their families. The Hockhocking is navigable six miles above Athens sor batteaux. The ho.tr-"], [559, "537 STATE OF OHIO. torn lands ar. better and more extensive than those ofthe Muskingum. In front of the town they are more than one mile wide. There are line quarries of freestone in the vicinity of the town. About two-thirds of the village lots are leased, and the residue fast settling. The uplands are timbered with white aud black oak, hickory, and chesnut; occasioually interspersed with sugar-maple, ash, and beech. The bottoms are covered with buckeye, pawpaw, elm, black walnut, spice wood, and honey locust. Fish in considerable quantities are taken from the rivers. Coal mines, chalybeate and sulphur springs, are so plentiful that no township is without several of each kind. Gallia County is bounded south and east by the Ohio river, Athens county north, Lawrence and Jackson west. It is watered by the Little Scioto, Leading, Racoon, Indian Guyandot, and Big-stone creeks. Like Athens, it is large and hilly, and thinly settled. It has much poor land, consisting of oak ridges of a thin gravelly soil. These hills skirt the Ohio through the whole extent of Scioto, Gallia, Washington, and Belmont counties extend ing back thirty or forty miles ; they become more elevated as we ascend the river ; nevertheless, the soil becomes better east of the Muskingum ; and as high up as Steuben ville, it may be said to be rich. The bottoms of the Ohio are wide. There are bodies of good land in the interior parts, on which the principal part of the timber is pitch pine, very lofty and straight. This kind of land is much esteemed by the inhabitants ; the soil is sandy, mixed in places with loam and gravel ; but it produces corn, wheat, oats, and potatoes, as abundantly as deeper soils. Galliopolis, is delightfully situated on the bank ofthe Ohio, three miles below the Great Kenhaway. The bot tom on which it is built, is elevated fourteen feet above the highest rise of the river. The soil is a rich, yellow clay, rendered mellow, like loam, by a proportion of fine sand. The streets are wide, and run in parallels with the river upwards of one mile and a quarter in length. The high lands ia the rear of the town, approach within half a mile ofthe river. This town was settled by a colony of 500 French, in 1790; but the present number of inhabit ants is considerably short of that number. There are about seventy-six houses, a court-house, church, and printing-office. The inhabitants have beautiful gardens. They make good wine, from a species of native vines, which are found on the islands a short distance above the town, and which, since they have been domesticated, pro duce grapes almost equal iu flavour fo the muscadins of"], [560, "538 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. France. There is a vineyard in the vicinity of this place, of six acres, which, in 1817, produced 1,000 gallons of wine. A mound of eighteen or twenty rods in circum ference is situated near the academy. Other remains of ancient works are visible both on the bottoms and neigh bouring hills. Lawrence County, bounded on the south by Ohio river, west by Scioto county, north by Jackson and east by Gallia. It is watered by Symmes', aud Indian Guyan dot creeks ; surface, broken ; soil, chiefly of an inferior quality ; timber, principally oak. This county was recent ly laid off, and is not yet organized. Jackson County is bounded north by Ross and Athens, east by Athens and Gallia, south by Gallia and Scioto counties. It is twenty-sour by twenty miles in extent, comprising 414 square miles. It was established in the winter of 1816. Surface, hilly ; soil, generally of a second quality; timber, oak, and hickory on the uplands. The Scioto salt-works, which belong to the United States, and at which considerable quantities of salt are made, are situ ated nearly in the centre of this county, on the eastern most branch of Salt creek, twenty-eight miles south-east of Chilicothe. It is expected that the seat of justice will be near these works. The principal streams are the three forks of Salt creek and the head branches of Symmes' creek. Washington County is bounded north by Mnskingum, Guernsey, and Monroe counties, south-east by the Ohio river, south and west by Athens and Fairfield. It is sixty three miles long from east to west, and from twelve to thirty-one in breadth, containing about 1,100 square miles. It is watered by the Ohio and Muskingum rivers, Little Muskingum, Pawpaw, Duck, Wolf, Miegs,and Little Hock hocking creeks. A large proportion of this county is hilly ; soil, poor, and timber chiefly oak. The bottoms, however, of the Ohio and Muskingum, and the large creeks, are pretty extensive and ofthe first quality. Marietta is situated on the first bank of the Ohio, imme diately above the entrance of the Muskingum. Like most ofthe towns on that fine river, its site and appearance is pleasant. Yet, hitherto, its growth has not kept pace with public expectation. It contains about 100 houses, exclu sive of thirty-five or forty on the opposite bank of the Muskingum, where fort Harmer formerly stood ; it has besides, a court-house, jail, market-house, academy, two churches, a bank, post-office, printing-office, two rope walks, steam grist mill, several mercantile stores, and four"], [561, "STATE OF OHIO. 539 well furnished inns. In March, 1816* a large commercial and exporting company was formed, since which the ship- building business has revived. Muskingum County is bounded north by Coshocton, east by Guernsey, south by Washington and Fairfield, and west by Fairfield and Licking counties. It is watered by the Muskingum and Licking rivers, and by Coal, Jonathan, VVakatomika, Salt, and Wills' creeks. It is large and populous, having an area of about 820 square mites, and a population of about 12,000 souls. Surface generally hilly; the lovers of romantic scenery will find ample grati- fication on the sharp, elevated ridges between Salt and V\\ ills' creeks, on the Wheeling road. Extensive beds of stone-coal are found in various parts of the county, espe- cially in the hills bordering the Muskingum river. Zanesville is situated on the east bank of the Muskingum river, opposite Putnam and the mouth of Licking, fifty miles by land above Marietta. It coutains about 240 houses, generally small but neat and well built. It has a court-house, jail, market-house, methodist meeting-house, three glass factories, two banks, land-office, nail factory, twenty-two mercantile stores, paper mill, several oil mills, numerous saw and grain mills, post-office, two printing- offices, in which are published the \"Muskingum Messen- ger,\" and \" Zanesville Express,\" and a book-binder. Opposite Zanesville, the Muskingum falls six feet in the space of a few rods, and Licking river forms a cascade at its entrance. A canal is now opening around the Musk- ingum rapids, through the town, by an association called the \" Zanesville Canal and Manufacturing Company,\" who intend to manufacture iron in all its various branches, cotton, wool, hemp, flax, paper, &c. The country about Zanesville and Putnam, is settled in every direction, and generally well cultivated. Coal abounds in the hills, and is often found in sinking wells. Four miles up Licking, is a forge and furnace. Knox County has Licking south, Coshocton east, Rich- land north and Delaware west. It is watered by the Whitewoman branch of the Muskingum, Owl creek, and branches of Licking and Scioto. It will rank among the most fertile counties ofthe state- Mounl-Fernon is the seat of justice; it is new but rapidly increasing in size and improvements. The largest streams are all boatable. Coshocton County is bounded north by Wayne, east by Tusearawas, south by Muskingum, and west by Knox counties. It is about thirty miles square. The Muskin- 3 z"], [562, "540 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. gum river runs through the south-eastern part ; she other streams are Wills' creek, and Whitewoman's river. Sur face generally uneven. It deservedly ranks among the best counties of the state. The bottoms of Whitewoman's and Tusearawas are wide and highly productive. The uplands are generally heavy timbered ; oak in places, with rich poplar and black walnut lands interspersed. It abounds with freestone, coal, and limestone. Coshocton, the seat of justice, is situated near the forks of the Muskingum, forty miles north of Zanesville, and contains about thirty houses and four stores. Richland County has Knox south, Wayne east, Huron and Medina north, and Indian lands west. It is watered by the head branches of the Huron, East fork of the San dusky, Clear fork, a branch of the Muskingum, Muddy creek, &c. Its name represents the quality of its soil, which will rank with any county in the state in point of fertility. It is new, and contains large bodies of rich unsettled lands. Mansfield and Green are the largest villages ; they are new but thriving. Tuscarawas County has Guernsey south, Harrison east, Wayne and Stark north, and Coshocton west. It is watered by the Tuscarawas, Stillwater, Conoten, Sugar, and Sandy creeks. New-Philadelphia, the seat of justice for Tuscarawas county, is situated on the eastern branch of Muskin gum river, on a large, level, and beautiful plain, opposite the mouth of Sugar creek. It contains the couuty build ings, five stores, and forty-seven dwelling-houses. It is fifty miles north-east from Zanesville, and 100 north-east wardly from Columbus. Lat. 40\u00b0 32' N. Ion. 4\u00b0 30' W. Wayne County is bounded south by Coshocton, east by Stark, north by Medina and part of Portage, and west by Richland. It was organised in the year 1808, and is thirty miles long by twenty-nine broad, containing 870 square miles. It is divided into twelve townships. The principal streams are Killbuck, running nearly a south course, and navigable up to Wooster, for boats of from ten to fourteen tons ; Apple creek, a tributary of Killbuck, a very good stream for mills ; Sugar creek, near the south east corner of the county, is likewise a good stream for mills ; Chippeway7, in the north-east, and Mohiccan, John creek, in the west side of the county, which is a very con siderable stream in its different ramifications in this county, and in Richland. The Lake fork, and Jerom's fork, are navigable for boats of tenor twelve tons, eighteen"], [563, "541 STATE OF OHIO. miles above the south boundary of the county. The soil is generally excellent. The creek bottoms are extensive and very fertile, producing immense crops of corn, when properly cultivated. The upland is very productive in wheat, rye, oats, com, flax, &c. The timber on the upland is very tall, and generally composed of white and black oak, walnut, cherry, hickory, and some sew chesnuts: the prevailing timber on the bottoms and low lands is ash, elm, sycamore, sugar maple and soft maple, together with some beech, interspersed with a variety of wild plums, crab apples, grape vines, buckeye, hazle, &c. The prices of land vary according to situation and natural and artifi cial advantages, being from three fo fifty dollars an acre. The principal towns in this county are Wooster, Paint ville, aud Jeromesville, Wooster, the seat of justice sor the county, commenced building in 1811, and now contains sixty dwelling-houses, together with seven stores, sour taverns, and a Jarge and excellent banking-house, for the German Bank of Wooster, a public land-office, for the sale of the United States' lands, a public school-house, and a meeting-house for the baptist society. Many of the buildings being built of brick, are large and elegant. The road from Pittsburgh to Mansfield and Upper Sandusky, and likewise that from Erie to Columbus passes through this place. The road from Zanesville to Granger and Cleveland, passes through this town, as likewise might be added the road from the termination of the great Cumberland road north-westerly to Lower Sandusky, and thence to Perrysville, at the head of ship navigation, on the Miami-of-the-lake, and onward lo Detroit. The population consists chiefly of emigrants from Pennsylvania. There are, however, some from the state of New York, and the eastern states. The population amounts to about 6,500. Its surplus produce is consumed by the numerous emigrants, who are crowd ing into the county. Ultimately its commerce will find its way to the shores of lake Erie, distant only forty-six miles. Artificial mounds of considerable size are found in this county. A brick was found in 1816, in digging a cellar in Wooster, under the stump ofa large oak tree, and about four feet below the surface of the earth. It was of the size and appearance ofa common brick. There were two others found in that cellar, that were less perfect in shape and consistence. Stark County has Harrison and Tuscarawas south. Columbiana east, Portage north, and Wayne \\v_t. The"], [564, "542 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. Tuscarawas branch of the Muskingum river runs from north to south eutirely through the county, on the western side, and is navigable as high up as the county extends, for keel-boats of any burden. Big Sandy, a large creek, falls into the Tuscarawas, near the southern boundary of the county. Nimishillen is a large creek which falls into Big Sandy on the north side, about four miles from its confluence with the Tuscarawas, and is one of the best mill streams in the state, with a sufficiency of water at all times of the year to drive water works of any description Adjoiuing this creek, and about four miles from Canton, are immense banks of iron ore of a superior quality. The building of a furnace is now in contemplation. There are in the neighbourhood of Canton, a number of excel lent bridges ; the first of importance is a toll bridge over the Tuscarawas river, about eight miles west of Canton, and oue mile from Kendal, on the road from Canton to Wooster. It is 612 feet in length, erected on stone piers, about twenty feet in height. The next in importance is over Nimishillen creek, one mite east of Canton, 650 feet in length, built on wooden piles; besides a number of others of less importance over the several branches ofthe Nimishillen creek. The first settlement in this county commenced in the spring of 1806, since which time the emigration hasequalled, if not surpassed, any thing ever witnessed in any part of the state. Agreeably to a census taken in 1815, the population amounted to 7,950 ; the pre sent population amounts to about 12,960. Canton, the seat of justice, is handsomely situated on an elevated plain, on the forks of Nimishillen creek. It is about eleven miles sous') of the northern boundary ofthe county, and is distant from Steubenville fifty miles north west; from Pittsburgh ninety-five west; from Columbus 120 miles north-east. In the town of Canton there are about eighty dwelling-houses, and upwards of 500 inha bitants. Also, nine mercantile stores, (besides six in other parts of the county) one cut nail factory, one wool card ing machine, an oil mill, a fulling mill, sour tanneries, and four taverns, besides boot and shoemakers, tailors, saddlers, cabinet-makers, carpenters, &c. About seven miles west of Canton, and adjoining the beautiful village of Kendal, a woollen manufactory is established, which is mauuf. c-turing cloth of a superb quality. Guernsey County has parts of Washington and Mon roe south, Bellmont and part of Harrison east, Tuscarawas north, and Muskingum west ; watered almost exclusively by Wills' creek and its branches. Surface, broken ; soil,"], [565, "STATE OF OHIO. 543 generally second quality. It is divided into nine town ships. The bottoms of Wills' creek are fertile and well cultivated. The culture of foreign grapes has been intro duced into this county. Cambridge, the chief town and seat of justice, is situ ated on the right bank of Wills' creek, at the intersection of the road leading from Zanesville to Wheeling. It has about sixty houses, three taverns, four stores, and a post office. Will's creek has good mill seats, a little above this town. A toll bridge 175 yards long has been built across Wills' creek, at this place Monroe County has Washington south, the Ohio river east, Belmont north, and Guernsey west. It is watered by branches of Duck, Pawpaw, Little Muskingum, Sunfish, and Capteena creeks, all running info the Ohio. In sur face, soil, timber, aud productions, it closely resembles Belmont and Guernsey. Coal mines and iron ore have been discovered on Sunfish creek. Woodfield, a new town, is the county seat. It is situ ated on high ground, in Centre township, in a central part of the county, fourteen miles from the Ohio river, and thirty-five north-west of Marietta. Belmont County has Monroe south, the Ohio river east, Harrison north, and Guernsey west. It is watered by Indian Wheeling, M'Mahon's, and Capteena creeks. It is hilly and broken, excepting the bottoms of the Ohio. Timber, oak, hickory, sugar maple, &c. St. Clairsville, the seat of justice for the above county, is situated on an elevated hill, seventy miles eastwardly from Zanesville, and eleven west of Wheeling. The sur rounding country is broken, but remarkably healthy. This town contains upwards of 150 houses, court-house, jail, three houses for public worship, viz. Friends, metho dists, and presbyterians; a market, two printing-offices, fifteen stores, a bank, and about 750 inhabitants. Harrison County has Belmont south, Jefferson east, parts of Columbia and Stark north, and Tuscarawas west. It is watered by Stillwater and other branches of the Tus carawas, and by creeks and brooks running into the Ohio. Its surface waving, and in most parts hilly. Timber, oak, chesnut, hickory, with some sugar maple, cherry, and black walnut. This county is settled chiefly by emigrants from Pennsylvania. It abounds with coal mines, freestone, limestone, and a fine white, tenacious clay, fit for manu facturing purposes. Jefferson County has a part of Belmont south, Ohio river east, Columbiana north, and Harrison west. If is"], [566, "544 UNITED STATES OF A.MERICA. watered by Indian-Short, Indian, Wills', and Yellow creeks, all running into the Ohio. The surface of this county is broken ; but the soil is of an excellent quality, and capa ble of producing wheat, corn, rye, oats, and flax. It is oue of the oldest settled counties in the state. The prin cipal towns are Steubenville and Mount-Pleasant. Sleubemrille, is delightfully situated on the first and second banks of the Ohio, seventy-two miles, by water, below Pittsburgh, and twenty above Wheeling. It is nearly as large as Pittsburgh, aud promises to rival the first cities of tbe west; it contains about 400 houses, many of them elegant and costly. Its growth, for the last four years has been uncommonly rapid. It has about forty mercantile stores, six taverns, a post-office, bookstore, and printing-office, at which is publised the \" Western Herald.\" It has a fine woollen manufactory, she machinery of which is propelled by steam ; steam paper-mill, producing paper of a superior quality;, and in quantifies more than sufficient to supply ten of the surrounding counties. A steam grist mill ; stone cotton factory, brewery, distillery, soap and candle factory. It is not long since lots in this village, sixty by 180 feet, sold for one hundred dollars each ; many of them now command from ten to 15,000 dollars each. Columbiana County has Jefferson and the Ohio river south, Pennsylvania east, Trumbull and a part of Portage north, and Stark west. It is watered by Little Beaver and branches of Big Beaver river. This county in sur face, soil, extent, and population, has a strong resemblance to Jefferson. It is rich in agricultural products, mills, coal mines, iron ore, and valuable timber. It contains about forty grist and saw mills; several extensive manu factories of cotton and woollen, a furnace, and several forges. Fairfield is the seat of justice. There are eight or ten other villages, nearly new. NEW CONNECTICUT Forms one of the districts of the state of Ohio, and is in length about 122 miles, its average breadth nearly forty-five, and its area about 5,349 square miles, or 3,423,360 acres. The claim of Connecticut to this dis trict is founded upon the charter of the state, granted by king Charles II., which included a part of the state of New York, a portion of Pennsylvania, and thence along"], [567, "545 STATE OF OHIO. the now state of Ohio and the territories to the westward. Both New York and Pennsylvania resisted the claim, and succeeded ; Connecticut afterwards surrendered her title to the United States, with the exception of the district in question. In 1793, the legislature granted 500,000 acres of the western part of it to indemnify the sufferers during the revolutionary war, and this tract is called the \" Fire Lands.\" Two years after, they sold the remainder to pri vate individuals for 1, '200,000 dollars, which is appro priated to the support of schools within the state. The purchasers of the lands made a divison of the property, and the settlements have been going forward pretty rapidly since 1799. The face of the country is generally level, in some places nearly flat, and in others swelling out into gentle hills. The soil is for the most part loam, intermixed with clay, and sometimes with gravel. There are considerable beds of freestone throughout the district, and coal and iron are also found, but in no great abundance ; though several iron-works are in operation, and it is presumed that a plentiful supply of both could be found, if properly sought for. It is most beautifully watered on the north by lake Erie, and there are a number of very useful rivers: the whole district is well supplied with springs of good wafer. The climate is temperate, and the seasons nearly the same as in the other parts of this state. Towards the head waters of the rivers, the country is flat and marshy, and in some few places swampy, in consequence of which fevers are more common in Portage and Cayahoga coun ties than any where else in the district. There are, how ever, no marshes or swamps but what may and will be drained, when tbe country is settled up ; the whole will then be a very fine climate, and a most agreeable place of residence. The farmers are mostly occupied in raising supplies for the internal consumption of the inhabitants, who manu facture nearly all their own clothing in their respective families, so that there is little commerce ; the chief trade is in salt, and a few ornamental imported goods : the principal exports are cattle and cheese. Hence farmers and mechanics are best adapted to the country, and the price of land is sufficiently low to invite them into it ; being about from three to five dollars an acre. The peo ple have generally the frugal, industrious habits of thc eastern states, from which they have mostly emigrated ; and are civil in their manners, arid moral in their deport-"], [568, "546 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. ment. Education is well attended to, and the inhabit ants are religious; but their population does not admit of many churches or clergy. \u2014 The district is now divided into the seven following counties, and contains about 25,000 inhabitants : Ashtabula County is bounded by lake Erie north, Geauga west, Trumbull south, and Pennsylvania east. It is watered by the Ashtabula, and numerous creeks. Trumbull County lies south of Ashtabula, north of Columbiana, west of Pennsylvania, arid east of Portage county. It is watered by branches cf the Big Beaver, running into the Ohio, and Grand river of the lake. Portage County lies north of Stark and Wayne, west of Trumbull, south of Geauga, and east of Medina ; and is watered by branches of Ashtabula, Big Beaver, Tus earawas, and Grand and Chagrin rivers. Geauga County has lake Erie north, Cayahoga county west, Portage south, and Ashtabula east ; and is watered by Grand and Chagrin rivers. Cayahoga County lies west of Geauga, south of lake Erie, east of Huron, and north of Medina. It is watered by Cayahoga and Rocky rivers, besides numerous large creeks. Medina County is bounded south by parts of Wayne and Richland, east by Portage, north by Cayahoga, and west by Huron. It is watered by the, head branches of Cayahoga, Rocky, and Black rivers, and the extreme branches ofthe Muskingum. Huron County is bounded south by Richland, or the parallel of lat. 41\u00b0 N., and Indian lands ; east by Medina, and Cayahoga counties, north by lake Erie, and west by Indian lands. It is large enough, when properly settled, fo form three additional counties ; and is watered by Black, Vermillion, Huron, Sandusky, and Portage rivers, and by Pipe, and Cold creeks. The fossil productions of these counties, are of great importance to the inhabitants. Coal is fonnd on the south and south-east parts of the Western Reserve, and near lake Erie on Rocky river. Almost every town has salt licks : when bored to the depth of 200 feet, they are said fo be rich. Salt has been made in Trumbull county, with out boring. Sulphur, chalybeate, and aluminous springs are numerous. Allum aud copperas are found in the high slate banks of the large streams. Iron ore, bog and rock, is abund ant, and proves to be good. Gypsum, chrystallized and gray, is found on the Cayahoga and Sandusky rivers."], [569, "547 STATE OF OHIO. Limestone is found in every county ; but is most abundant iu Huron, on the prairies between Huron and Sandusky rivers. Mill-stones, grind-stones, and whet-stones are made in several parts of the Reserve. The road from Erie to Cleveland continues the greater part of th^ way, oo an alluvial ridge, of about the height aud width of a well-raised turnpike road. When closely examined, one would suppose \" this was once the margin of lake Erie ; this mound to have been raised by its waves.\" This natural turnpike consists of sand, pebbles, and shells, similar to those ou the beach of the lake. TOWNS AND SETTLEMENTS. Warren, the seat of justice for Trumbull county, is the oldest village in the northern parts of Ohio. It is situated near the Mahoning branch ofthe Big Beaver. This coun try is the most populous of any in the Reserve, and has several forges, and a furnace. Wild lands are worth from five to fifteen dollars an acre. Improved farms have been sold as high as fifteen dollars, for an entire tract. Harpersfield, the seat of justice for Ashtabula, is situated on the road leading from Erie to Cleveland, some miles east of Ashtabula river. Here is an old settlement, extend ing afong the road for several miles, and is chiefly remark able for the abundance of peach orchards, the most ex tensive of any in the United States, and fine dairies. Austinburgh, is situated a few miles south of Harpers field. Pine timber is found, in limited quantities, on the Ashtabula, Grand and Chagrin rivers. Pine boards are ex ported to Canada from Grand river. Pay ns ville, is situated on the left bank of Grand river, about one mile from the lake. It has about forty houses, several mills, and three stores; it has a high, dry, sandy plain in its rear. Ravenna, the seat of justice for Portage, is situated in the centre of populous settlements ; in its neighbourhood is an abundance of iron ore, which is very rich ; a ton and a half of ore yields one ton of iron. Cleveland is situated on the right bank ofthe Cayahoga, half a mile from lake Erie. Its site is dry, sandy, and elevated 200 feet above the level of the river and lake ; nevertheless, bilious fevers and agues, have frequently afflicted the inhabitants. The cause is to be ascribed to the surf of the lake choking up the river, and causing a stagnation of its water for three miles upwards. There are about forty or fifty houses The soil for three or four mites east and south is sandy. Timber, oak, and hickory. 4a"], [570, "548 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. Hudson, is situated on the road leading from Cleveland to Canton, near Tinker's creek, running into the Cnynho ea. Medina, and Huron are now receiving a great number of emigrants. The first is beautifully watered, has large borders of unimproved lands ; vast quantities of iron ore ; a furnaoe is now building; as is also a great number of mills. The land between the Cayahoga and Rocky rivers, near the lake, is poor ; to the west of Rocky river the aspect and quality of the soil improves very much, until we approach Black river ; between which and Verntillion tbe soil is generally of a second quality, except on the lake shore, and generally too low to suit nice judges of farming land. Up Vermillion there is much poor white oak land, too wet to be healthy. The banks of Black and Vermillion rivers are low, and in some places marshy ; and from Vermillion to Huron, the country is ofa rich soil, but too low, in many situations, to promise health. The bot toms of Huron have proved sickly for eight or ten miles up, after which the country is uncommonly healthy. Timber, sugar maple, beech, elm, oak, chesnut, honey locust, and buckeye, on the bottoms. SO salubrious is the air, and so excellent is the water above the forks, that it has already become proverbial with the inhabitants resid- ing uear the mouth of the river, to say, lhat \"the people above the forks have received leases of their lives.\" The prairies commence within one mile of Huron, six or seven miles from the lake, and extend to the Miami-of-tbe-lakes, interspersed with large and small bodies of woodland. The country between Huron and Sandusky, a few miles from the lake, has proved favourable to health, especially on Pipe and Cold creeks. From Pipe creek to Croghans ville is thirty-four miles, the first half of the way prairie, variegated with strips and islets of woodland, and small ponds ; the last, timbered land, oak, hickory, black wajnut, and bass wood. Croghansville, is situated on the left or west bank of the Sandusky, near fort Stephenson, eighteen miles from lake Erie. It contains about thirty houses. Fort Stephenson is situated on the west bank of the Sandusky; at the dis tanoe of 200 yards from the river, where the second banks are bout fifty feet high. Seven miles above the fort are the Seneca and Delaware Indian villages. The distance from this post to fort Meigs, is forty miles ; the road passes through the Black Swamp, which is four miles wide. The country between this road and the great meadow is too flat for cultivation, though the soil is extremely rich. Fenice, a new town, on the margin of Sandusky, is just"], [571, "549 STATE OF OHIO. commenced building Since July, 1816, thirty lots have been sold; one saw and one grist mill, are in operation within three fourths of a mile of its site, ou Cold creek, a never failing stream. A grist mill, with four run ofstones. a paper-mill, and other water machinery, are about to be erected. The great business of the state of Ohio is agriculture, aided by such brauches of mechanism as tend to support that important object, and such manufactures as are calcu lated for the state of society ; together with teachers, doc tors, and lawyers, of which the former have the best chance of success. Land iu this state, under good cultivation, produces thirty bushels of wheat, fifty to seventy-five of Indian corn, and the same of rye. Wheat sells iu tbe Ohio markets for 3s. 4;_. (English money) a bushel ; rye, 2s. 8_rf. ; Indian corn, 2s. 3d. Horses sell from forty to 100 dollars ; cows, from twelve to twenty dollars. The yearly wages ofa labouring man is from \u00a359 to \u00a366, and of a woman \u00a332. Mechanics wages in different districts have been already noticed ; but it may be proper here lo observe, that throughout the western states, workmen of every descrip- tion are liberally paid for their services Taking the low prices of the necessaries of life iu connection with the value of labour, it will be seen that an ordinary workman can procure for a day's work, fifty lbs. of flour, or twenty lbs. of beef, or three bushels of potatoes, or twenty-seven lbs. of pork, or eight fowls, or four ducks, or two ordinary geese, or one very large turkey. The price of laud varys very much, according to situa- tion. Farms which are called improved can be bought at from eight to thirty dollars an acre ; the improvements often consist ofa few rough log buildings, and from twelve to twenty acres under cultivation : buildings are included in the price of the land. The next class of farms have from twenty to fifty acres under cultivation ; the propor tion of arable and wood about two thirds, of meadow and pasturage nearly equal proportions. Any of the land is here capable by culture, of being turned into meadow. The whole amount of every description of taxes on land is from Qs. 9d to 13s. 6d. for one hundred acres. Tn support of education there is a more ample fund provided than in any other country in the world ; con sisting of one-36th part of all the lands in the state ! The improvements of the country have been commensurate with the spirit and industry of the people ; as will be seen by the notice that has been taken of the towns, manufac-"], [572, "550 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. tories, roads, bridges, &c. Besides these towns, there is a vast number of villages, mostly all increasing, and an nually rising in such numbers, as to render it extremely difficult for topographical description to keep pace with the progress of improvement; and the view of the build ings in the towns, villages, and on the farms, shews the increase of industry, of wealth, and of public taste. The first erections are mostly temporary log huts ; these give way to frame houses; and in many districts of this state, the number of elegant brick and stone buildings is really surprising. Upon the whole, the state of Ohio promises fair to become one of the brightest in the Union, in point of internal prosperity and a virtuous population. Thc following statement shews the number of Indians, of all ages and sexes, within the limits of the state of Ohio, in 1816, viz.

Situation, Boundaries, and Extent. This interesting country, lately denominated the In diana Territory, is now the nineteenth state ofthe repub lic, being admitted as such in 1816 ; and so great is the fertility of the soil, the healthiness of the climate, and its commanding situation, that it will undoubtedly become a very bright star in the American Union. \u2014 It is situated between!^0 45' and 41\u00b0 52' N. lat. and 7\u00b0 40' and 10\u00b0 47' W. long. Bounded on the north by the Michigan terri-"], [574, "552 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. tory, lake Michigan, and Northwest territory ; south by the river Ohio, which separates it from Kentucky ; east, by the state of Ohio ; and west, by the Wabash river, which divides it from the state of Illinois. Its length, from north to south, is 312 miles, aud its breadth from east to west, 150 miles ; forming an area of about 43,000 square miles, or 27,520,000 acres. Rivers, lakes, creeks. \u2014 The Ohio washes the southern border of Indiana, from the mouth ofthe Great Miami, te that ofthe Wabash, a distance, measuring its windings, of 472 miles ; all the streams which intersect this extensive line of coast, are comparatively short; for the southern fork of White river, having its source within a sew miles of the Ohio boundary line, runs nearly parallel with the Ohio, at the distance of from forty to sixty miles. The principal of these enter the Ohio in the order named. Tanner's creek, two miles below Lawrenceburgh, thirty miles long, and is thirty yards wide at its mouth; heads in the Flat woods, to the south of Brookville. Lottghery's creek, is forty miles long, and fifty yards wide at its mouth, being the next stream worthy of men tion below the Great Miami, from which it is distant eleven miles. Indian creek, sometimes called Indian Kentucky, and by the Swiss, Venoge, constitutes tbe southern limit ofthe Swiss settlement, eight miles below the mouth of Ken tucky river. It rises in the hills near the south fork of White river, forty-five miles north-east of Vevay. Wyandot creek, heads in the range of hills extending in a transverse direction, from near the mouth of Blue river, to the Muddy fork of White river, and falls into the Ohio about equidistant from the falls and Blue river. Big Blue river heads still farther north, but near the south fork of White river. After running fifty miles south west, it inclines to the east of south, and enters the Ohio thirty-two miles below the mouth of Salt river. Its name indicates the colour of its water, which is o^ a clear blue ish cast ; but in quality pure and healthful. Lillie Blue riv er empties into the Ohio, thirteen miles below the mouth of Big Blue river ; it is about forty yards wide at its mouth ; its course is from north-east to south west. Ten miles below is Sinking creek, fifty yards wide at its mouth. Anderson's river, sixty miles farther down, is the most considerable stream between Blue river aud the Wabasb."], [575, "553 STATE OF INDIANA. Below this, are Pegion and Beaver creeks. In addition to the preceding creeks and rivers, a large number of re spectable creeks and rnus also enter the Ohio, at different points between the Miami aud the Wabash, so that that part of Indiana, lying between White river and the Ohio, may be pronounced well watered. It is the character of most of the foregoing streams to possess a brisk current and pure water ; the consequence is, an abundance of con venient mill-seats, and a salubrious and healthful climate. The Wabash waters the central and western parts of the state. The main branch of this fine river, heads two miles east of old fort St. Mary's, and intersects the portage road between Loramie creek and the river St. Mary's, in Darke county, Ohio. There are three other branches, all winding through a rich and extensive country. The first, called Little river, heads seven miles south of fort Wayne, and enters the Wabash, about eighty miles below the St. Mary's portage. The second is the Massissinway, which heads in Darke county, Ohio, about half way be tween forts Greenville and Recovery7, and unites with the others, five miles below the mouth of Little river. The the third, is Eel river, which issues from several lakes and ponds, eighteen miles west of sort Wayne; it enters the Wabash, eight miles below the mouth of the Massissin way. From the entrance of Eel river, the general course of the Wabash is about ten degrees south of west, to the mouth of Rejoicing river, eighty-five miles, where it takes a southern direction, to the mouth of Rocky river, forty miles ; here it inclines to the west, to the mouth of the Mas contin, thirty-six miles, where it pursues a southern course, to Vincennes, fifty miles, from fhis town to the Ohio, its general course is south, 100 miles. It is 300 yards wide at its mouth, and enters the Ohio at right angles. Its length, from its mouth to its extreme source, exceeds 500 miles. It is navigable for keel-boats, about 400 miles, to Ouitanon, where there are rapids. From this village small boats can go within six miles of St. Mary's river; ten of fort Wayne ; and eight of the St. Joseph's of the Miami of-lhe-lakes. -.Ils current is gentle above Vincenues, below the town there are several rapids, but not of sufficient magnitude to prevent boats from ascending. The prin- cipal rapids are between Deche and White rivers, ten miles below Vincennes. The tributary waters, which enter from the left bank of the Wabash, are, the Petoka, White river, Deche river, Little river, the St. Marie, Rocky river, Petite, or Little river, and Pomme river. Besides the rivers above enume-"], [576, "554 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. rated, there are an immense number of creeks and runs, affording in most places a sufficient supply of water. But there are pretty extensive districts between Little and Rocky rivers, where water cannot readily be procured. The right or north-west bank ofthe Wabash receives a greater number of rivers than the left. Crossing this no ble stream, at the mouth of Pomme river, and descending upou its right shore, the first considerable water is Richard's creek, from the north-west; ten miles farther enters Rocky river, from the north-west ; eight miles farther down, is the Tippacanoe, which heads about thirty miles to the west of sort Wayne. From the mouth of Tippacanoe, we succes sively p:iss Pine, and Redwood creeks ; Rejoicing, oi Ver million Jaune, Little Vermillion, Erabliere, Duchat, and Brouette rivers, at the distance of from ten to fifteen miles from each other, and all coming from (he west or north west -, mostly small, and having their heads in the state of Illinois. Whitewater, rises near the eastern boundary line, twelve miles west of sort Greenville, and nearly parallel with this line, at the distance of from six to ten miles, and watering in its progress, twenty-two townships, in Wayne, Frank lin, and Dearborn counties. At Brookville, thirty miles from its entrance into the Miami, it receives the West fork, wbich heads in the Flat woods, thirty miles west of that village, and interlocks with the branches of White river. This beautiful little river waters nearly 1,000,000 acres of fine land, and owes its name to the unusual transpa rency of its wafer. A fish or pebble can be seen at the depth of twenty feet. The north-eastern part of the state is watered by the St. Joseph's of the Miami-of-the-lakes, and its tributaries ; this river heads about sixty miles to the north-west of fort Wayne, and forms a junction with the St. Mary's, just above this post. Panther's creek, from the south, is its largest fork. Its remote branches interlock with those of the rivers Raisin, Black, St. Joseph's of lake Michigan, and Eel river. That part of the state bordering on the Michigan terri tory, is liberally watered by the head branches ofthe river Raisin of lake Erie ; the numerous forks of Black river of lake Michigan ; and the St. Joseph's of lake Michigan, the latter heads near, and interlocks with the branches of Eel river ; and pursues a serpentine course, seventy miles, through the northern part of Indiana. The rivers Chemin, Big and Little Kennomic, all of which fall into lake Michigan ; the Theakaki, Kickapoo,"], [577, "555 STATE OF INDIANA. and a part of the chief branch of the Illinois, all wind through the north-western section of the state; and all, except the last, are entirely within its boundaries ; the three first run from south to north ; the latter, south and south-west. Besides the country is chequered by nume rous creeks. The northern half of the state is a country of lakes, thirty eight of which are from two to ten miles in length ; but the actual number probably exceeds 100; many of these, however, are mere ponds, less than one mile in length. Some have two distinct outlets, one running iuto the north ern lakes, the other into the Mississippi. The greater part of these lakes are situated between the head waters ofthe two St. Joseph's, Black river, Raisin, Tippacanoe, and Eel rivers. Aspect of the country. \u2014 A range of hills called the Knobs, extends from the falls of the Ohio, to the Wabash, nearly in a south-western direction, which, in many places, produces a broken and uneven surface. North of these hills, lie the Flat woods, seventy miles wide, and reaching nearly to the Ouitanan country. Bordering all the prin cipal streams, except the Ohio, there are strips of bottom and prairie land ; both together are from three to six miles in width. Between the Wabash and lake Michigan, the country is mostly champaign, abounding alternately wilh woodlands, prairies, lakes, and swamps. A range of hills run parallel with the Ohio, from the mouth of the Great Miami to Blue river, alternately ap proaching to within a few rods, and receding to the dis tance of two miles ; but broken at short intervals by nume rous creeks. Immediately below Blue river, the hills disappear, and the horizon presents nothing to view but an immense tract of level land, covered with a heavy growth of timber. That part of the state lying west of the Ohio boundary fine, north ofthe head branches of White river, east and south of the Wabash, has been described by the con ductors of expeditions against the Indians, as a \" country containing much good land ; but intersected at the distance of four or six miles, with long, narrow swamps, boggy and mirey, the soil of which is a stiff blue clay.\" North of the Wabash, between Tippacanoe and Ouita nan, the banks of the streams are high, abrupt, and broken, and the laud well timbered, except on the prairies. Between the Plein and Theakaki, the country is flat, no. xxiv. 4 b"], [578, "556 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. wet, and swampy, interspersed wilh prairies of an inferior quality of soil. In going from the Ohio to the Wabash, say from Clark's ville or Madison to Vincennes, the ascent is from two to 300 feet to the top of the last bauk of the Ohio. There is then a strip of country, twenty miles wide, tolerably level, except where gullied by tbe actions of streams. This brings the traveller to the foot of the Knobs, which are at least 500 feet higher than the land in the rear ; after this there are no very tedious hills, until with in three miles of Vincennes. Frem this place to the Ohio, the traveller is not sensible of ascending to the height he finds himself, on the summit of the Knobs, from which the eye can distincly trace, at the distance of twenty miles, the deep, serpentine vale of the Ohio, and the positions of New-Lexington, Corydon, and Louisville, in Kentucky. The prairies bordering the Wabash, are particularly rich ; wells have been sunk in them, where the vegetable soil was twenty-two feet deep, under whieh was a stratum of fine white sand, containing horizontal lines, plainly indicating to the geologist, the gradual subsidence of water. Yet the ordinary depth is from two to five feet. The country between fort Wayne and the St. Joseph's of lake Michigan, in every direetion, is beautiful, present ing a fine prospect. There are no hills to be seen ; a champaign country, the greater part prairie, affording in exhaustible grazing, and presenting the most delightful natural meadows, and the grass cured would be almost equal to our hay ; there are also vast forests of valuable timber, and the soil exceedingly rich. The rivers have their sources in swamps, and sometimes from delightful inland lakes. It is not unfrequent to see two opposite streams supplied by the same water or lake, one running into the waters of the Mississippi, and the other into the northern lakes. Neither China nor Holland ever had such natural advantages for inland water communications. The country between the Wabash and lake Michigan, is admirably calculated for the convenience of inland navi gation. A trifling expense would open a navigable com munication between Eel river, and a branch of the Little St. Joseph's; the two St, Joseph's; the Raisin of lake Erie, and the Lenoir [Black river] of lake Michigan. Small lakes are discovered in every part of this extensive and romantic country ; and many of them are covered with ducks and other water-fowl. The country around the head branches of Eel river, Panther's creek, aud St. Joseph's-of-the-Miami, is gene-"], [579, "557 STATE OF INDIANA. rally low and swampy ; and too wet for oultiration. But even in that quarter, there are many beautiful situations. The timber is oak, hickory, black walnut, beech, sugar maple, elm, and honey locust. The woodlands line tha water course ; but branch out frequently into the prairies. The immeuse prairies on the south bank of the St. Jo- seph's of lake Michigan, afford many rich, beautiful, and picturesque views. They are from one to ten miles wide ; of unequal lengths; and as level as lakes. In point of fertility, not inferior to the lands around Lexington, Ken. or the bottoms of the Ohio. These natural meadows are covered with a tall grass; and are separated by strips of woods, containing oak, maple, locust, lyn, poplar, plum, ash, and crab apple. In these woodlands, there are generally creeks, runs, or springs ; but never in the open prairies, unless in wet aud rainy seasons, when the waters form temporary sluggish brooks, wherever there is suffi- cient descent for the purpose. Yet water may be obtained by digging to the depth of twenty or thirty feet. All the rivers in the interior of Indiana have spacious bottoms, and they uniformly wander from the line of their courses, so that in making fifty miles progress, in a direct line, they water 100 miles of territory by their sinuosities. By these frequent bends, the length of river coast, and the quantity of bottom land is nearly doubled, which amply compensates for extra toil and expense of navi- gation. The prairies on tbe Wabash, in the vicinity of fort Harrison are from one to five miles wide, bordering on the river, and from oue to twelve in length ; the streams that run into the Wabash, divide one prairie from an- other ; on which there are strips of woods from half a mile to a mile wide, the timber is excellent ; the soil of the prairies is a black vegetable mould, intermixed with fine sand, aud sometimes gravel. In choosing a situation for a farm, it is important so to locate a tract, as to have half prairie and half woodland; by which means the settler will have a plantation cleared to his hand. The new purchase contains 120 townships, or 6,800,000 acres. The lands sell very high in the neigbbourhood of fort Harrison, for it is the most delightful situation fora town on the Wabash, and the soil is the richest of any in the state. This will undoubtedly become the seat of a new county, at no remote period. The fort is garrisoned by 150 riflemen, of the regular 'army. There are six families living in log oabins, near the fort, who improve congress rands ; they have been here five years. Wherever they"], [580, "558 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. have cultivated the ground, it produces abundantly. The woods abound with deer, bears, wolves, and wild turkies. Reptiles and venomous serpents are not numerous. A few rattle-snakes and some copperheads comprise all that are dangerous. i The lands on White river are well watered with springs and brooks. There is hardly a quarter section without water ; the country in this quarter is, in many places, hilly aud broken, and in some parts stony. Limestone is most predominant ; but there are quarries of freestone. Although the country is well watered, good mill-seats are scarce. There can be a sufficiency of small mills for the accommodation of the inhabitants. Steam mills, with out doubt, will be in operation as soon as the country is sufficiently settled, for the purpose of grinding flour for exportation. There are some excellent tracts of land in Indiana ; corn is raised pretty easy ; and stock with little attention, and in some places with little or no fodder. This country is full of prairies, some of them are excellent land. The timber around them consists principally of oak, of which the inhabitants make most of their rails, and sometimes draw them three miles. Wheat grows stout ; but the grain is not so plump as it is in the state of New York. The two branches of Whiteriver are navigable wilh boats in high water, for the distance of 130 miles. Iron ore is found on its banks The wheat yields the inhabitants, who are neat farmers, 681bs. a bushel, and never gets winter-killed or smutty; the only difficulty they experience in its culture is, that the land in many places is too rich, until it has been im poverished. Apple trees bear every year. Peaches some years do exceedingly well ; so do cherries, currants, and most kinds of fruit. Wheat is 8s. 4|c_. a bushel ; flour 13s. Qd. a hundred ; delivered at fort Harrison, 18s. ; corn, Is. lid. a bushel; pork, 18s.; beef, 18s. a cwt. ; butter and cheese from 6 }d. to Is. I id. per lb. ; honey 2s. 3d. per jrallon ; maple sugar Is. lid. per lb. European goods exorbitantly high. Conl mines are numerous near the Wabash, she banks of which are in many places, subject to be overflowed in high water, When the Ohio is at full height, ils waters set back and inundate the bottoms of the Wabash to the distance of four or five miles. The winters are mild, compared with those of the north ern states. The autumnal frosts are earlier here than in the western counties of New York ; but the weather is"], [581, "559 STATE OF INDIANA. very fine till Christmas; then changeable until about the middle of February, when winter breaks up, and spring soon commences. Peaches are in blossom by the first of March, and by the 10th of April, the forests are clad in green. The flowering shrubs and trees are in full blos som some days before the leaves get their growth, which gives the woods a very beautiful appearance. Salt, at and above Vinceunes, is two dollars a bushel, though considerable quantities are made at the United States' saline, thirty miles below the mouth of the Wabash, in the Illinois territory, where it is sold for one dollar a bushel. The chief supply comes from the salt-works on the Great Kenhaway. There have been salt-works sunk by boring, near the Ohio, to the depth of 500 feet, where the water is said to be very strong. There are likewise salt springs on she Indian lands not far from the northern boundary of the new purchase. Civil divisions, towns, population, &c. \u2014 Indiana is divided into nineteen counties, six of which have been laid out since the census was taken in 1815. At that time the population amounted to 68,780, at present it exceeds 100,000 souls. Dearborn County is bounded east by the state of Ohio, south by the Ohio river, west by Switzerland county, and north by franklin county. It is well water ed by Tanner's, Houglane's and Loughery's creeks, White water, and the head branches of Indian Kentucky. The south part of the county is broken ; the north end level, being in the Flat Woods. The Ohio bottoms are low but fertile. The timber in the middle and northern parts is oak, hickory, poplar, and sugar maple. Lawrenceburgh stands on the bank of the Ohio, two miles below the mouth of the Great Miami. It has not flourished for several years past, owing, principally to its being subject to inundation, when the Ohio is high. A new town called Edinburgh, half a mile from the river, on a more elevated situation, promises to eclipse it. Rising-sun is delightfully situated on the \"second bank of the Ohio, with a gradual descent to the river. It con tains thirty or forty houses, and is halfway between Vevay and Lawrenceburgh. It has a post-office, and a floating mill anchored abreast the town. It has had a very rapid growth, and will probably become a place of consider able trade. Franklin County has the state of Ohio on the east,"], [582, "560 UNITED STATES OF A.M_-RICA. Dearborn county south, and ludian lands west and north. It is oue of the best counties in the state, and was estab lished about six years ago. It is principally watered by Whitewater and its branches, upou which there are some of the best bottom lands iu the western couutry, and has been the centre of an ancient population, as is proved by the great number of mounds and fortifications, to be seen on the bottoms and hills. There are no prairies in this county- Both sides of Whitewater, from its mouth to Brookville, are tolerably well settled. Here are some of the finest farms to be met with in the western country. A number of mills have been erected. The upland is pretty level, and the principal timber white oak, hickory, and black walnut. The oak trees are remarkably tall and handsome ; and well suited either for rails, staves, or square timber. The soil is free from stones, and easily eleared and ploughed ; producing fine crops of wheat and corn. Genseng grows in the bottoms ; and upon the spurs of the bills, and the poorest soil, is found the wild columbo root. Brookville is pleasantly situated in the forks of White water, thirty miles north of Lawrenceburgh and the Ohio river ; twenty miles south of Salisbury ; about forty-two north-west of Cincinnati, and twenty-five from Hamilton. It was laid out in the year 1811 ; but no improvements were made until the succeeding year, and then but par tially ; owing to the unsettled state of the frontiers ; its vicinity to the Indian boundary, being not more than fifteen miles. The late war completely checked the emi gration to this country, and consequently the town ceased to improve ; but since that period, its rapid accession of wealth and population has been unexampled in the west ern country. There are now in the town upwards of 120 buildings, exclusive of shops, stables, and out-houses. The build ings are generally frame, and a great part of them hand somely painted. There are within the precincts of the town, one grist-mill and two saw-mills, two fulling-mills, three carding-machines, one printing-office, at which is published, a weekly journal entitled the \"Plain Dealer.\" There are also a jail, a market-house, and a handsome brick court-house, nearly finished. The ground on which the town stands, is composed of a rich and sandy loam, covering a thin stratum of clay, underneath w hich is a great body of gravel and pebbles ; consequently the streets are but seldom muddy, and con tinue so but for a short time. The public square and a"], [583, "STATE OF INDIANA. 561 great part of the town stands on a beautiful level, lhat is elevated between seventy and eighty feet above the level of the river ; and in short, the situation of the town, the cleanliness ofthe streets, the purity of the waters, and the aspect ofthe country around, all combine to render it one of the most healthy and agreeable situations in the west ern country. There are, perhaps, few places that possess equal advan tages, or that present a more flattering prospect of future wealth and importance than this. As a situation for ma nufactories, it is unequalled ; the two branches of White water affording a continued succession of the best sites for the erection of water-works, from their junction almost te their sources, and many valuable situations may be found below the town, on the main river. The country watered by this stream is inferior to none. Along the river and all its tributary streams, are extensive and fer tile, bottoms, bounded by hills of various heights ; and im mediately from the top of these, commences a level and rich country, timbered with poplar, walnut, beech, sugar tree, oak, ash, hickory, elm, buckeye, &c. and a variety of shrubs and underbrush. The soil of this land is peculi arly adapted to the culture of small grain, and for grazing. Wheat was grown in the neighbourhood of this place, that weighed from sixty-five to sixty-eight pounds per bushel ; and excellent crops of grass are produced without the aid of manure. Corn, oats, rye, flax, hemp, sweet and Irish potatoes, &c. are prodnced in abundance. During the year 1816, manyT successful experiments were made in rearing tobacco, and the soil has been pro nounced by good judges, to be as congenial to its growth, as the best lands iu the state of Virginia, Kentucky, or the Carolinas. As an evidence of the fertility ofthe country, corn and oats are selling at Is. 1 \\d. ; rye, at Is. 9\\d. ; and wheat at 3s. A\\d. per bushel ; beef, at 2d., and pork at 2\\d. per pound. The country is well supplied with good water from a great number of springs, and water may also be obtained iu almost any place by digging to a moderate depth. Another source from which this town must eventually derive great importance, is the ease and small expense with which the navigation of Whitewater, from the junc tion of the forks, can be so far improved as to carry out into the Ohio, all articles that may be raised for expor tation. To the north and north-west of this place is an exten sive and fertile country, that is fast growing into import-"], [584, "562 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. ance ; and in wealth and population, will soon be inferior to but few districts on the waters of the Ohio ; and, owing to tbe geographical situation of the country, all the inter course of the inhabitants with the Ohio river, must be through this place. Harrison. This village is situated on the north side of Whitewater, eight miles from its mouth, eighteen north east of Brookville, and in the centre of a large tract of Some of the best land in the state. More than one hall of the village stands on the Ohio side of the state line. There are about thirty-five houses, mostly new. A considerable number of the inhabitants are from the state of New York. They have all very fine and valuable farms, worth from forty to sixty dollars au acre. The settlement was com menced about sixteen years ago. The bottoms are here from one to two miles wide ; the soil remarkably deep and rich, and the woods free from brushwood. The trees are ofa moderate growth, but straight and thrifty. Almost every building lot in Harrison village contains a small mound ; and some as many as three. On the ueiSf bouring hills, north-east of the town, are a number ofthe remains of stone houses. They are covered with soil, brush, and full grown trees. The earth, roots, and rub bish having been cleared away from one of them, it was found to have been anciently occupied as a dwelling ; being about twelve feet square; the walls had fallen nearly to the foundation. They appeared to have been built of rough stones, like our stone walls. Not the least trace of any iron tools having been employed to smooth the face of them, could be perceived. At one end of the building, there was a regular hearth, containing ashes and coals ; before which there were found the bones of eight persons of different ages, from a small child to the heads of the family. The positions of their skeletons dearly indicated, that their deaths were sudden and simultaneous. They were probably asleep, with their feet towards the fire, when destroyed by an enemy, an earth quake, or pestilence. Wayne County is bounded on the east by the slate of Ohio, on the south by the county of Franklin, on the west and north by Indian lands, It is watered by the north fork of Whitewater, the head brooks of the north fork of Whiteriver, sources of Rocky river, Massissinway, and main branch of the Wabash. It is very extensive, of a level surface, well timbered, contains fine lands, and has been settled ten years. Its products are Indian corn, wheat, rye, oats, and tobacco."], [585, "563 STATE OF INDIANA. Salisbury lies thirty miles north of Brookville ; con tains about thirty-five houses, two stores, and two taverns. It is at present the seat of justice for Wayne county ; but Centreville, a new village, being more central, will pro bably become its competitor for that privilege. Switzerland County is bounded west by Jefferson, south by the Ohio river, north in part by Indian lands, and east by Dearborn county. Its surface is, in some places, broken by the Ohio aud Silver creek hills, which, however, are of a pretty good soil. It is watered by Venoge and Plum creeks, and several small runs; some running into the Ohio, and others into Whiteriver. New Switzerland, the settlement of New Switzerland was commenced by a few emigrants, in the spring of 1805. It extends from about three quarters of a mile above the mouth of Plum creek, down the river to the mouth of Indian creek, now called Venoge ; a distance of about four miles and a half, fronting the river. There has been a gradual accession of numbers to this interesting colony. As early as 1810, they had eight acres of vineyard, from which they made 2,400 gallons of wine, which, in its crude state, was thought by good judges, to be Superior to the claret of Bourdeaux. A part of this wine was made out of the Madeira grape. They have now greatly augment- ed the quantity of their vineyard grounds, which, when bearing, present to the eye of the observer the most inter- esting agricultural prospect, perhaps, ever witnessed ia the United States. They are rapidly extending their vine- yards ; they also cultivate Indian corn, wheat, potatoes, hemp, flax, and other articles necessary to farmers, but in quantities barely sufficient for domestic use. Some of their women manufacture straw hats; they are made quite different from the common straw bonnets, by tying the straws together instead of plaiting and sewing the plaits. They are sold in great numbers in the neighbouring settle- ments, and in the states of Mississippi and Indiana. Fevay, the seat of justice, is situated half a mile above the upper vineyards, on the second bank of the Ohio, twenty-five feet above high-water mark, and is nearly equidistant from Cincinnati, Lexington, and Louisville, or forty-five miles from each. The view of the Ohio is extensive, being eight miles. The couutry in the rear is broken but fertile. The climate is mild, and the sweet potatoe is cultivated with success. Cotton would doubt- less do well. There are several roads which diverge from this settlement. Three mails arrive weekly. This town was laid out in 1813, and uow contains eighty-four dwell- 4c"], [586, "564 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. ing-houses, besides thirty-four mechanics' shops, of diffe rent professions. It has a church, court-house, jail, and school-house of brick ; and a printing-office, publishing a weekly newspaper called the \" Indiana Register.\" There is a library of 300 volumes ; and a literary society in which are several persons of genius, science, aud literature. Jefferson County is bounded on the east by Switzer land county, on the south by the river Ohio, on the west by the county of Clark, on the north by Indian lands. It contains a great proportion of excellent land, and is watered by several small creeks running into the Ohio, and by the Mescatitak, a branch of the south fork of Whiteriver, which heads within five miles of the Ohio river. New Lexington, this flourishing town is situated in a rich settlement, sixteen miles east ofthe Knobs ; and con tains about forty houses, some of them brick and frame, and others built with hewn logs. There is a post-office, and printing-office, in which is printed the \" Western Eagle.\" The surface of the surrounding country for several miles, is sufficiently undulating to give the water of the creeks and runs a brisk motion. The stones towards the Ohio are calcareous : to the west and north-west, clayey slate. The soil is very productive. In the vicinity of this place, wells have been sunk to the depth of nearly 500 feet, in quest of salt-water, which has been found, and exceeds in strength any salt-water in the western country, and affords from three to four bushelsof salt, to the hundred gallons of water. Madison, the seat of justice for the county, is situated on the upper bank of the Ohio, thirty miles below Vevay, and contains sixty or seventy houses, mostly small and new. The banking institution called the \" Farmer's and Mechanic's Bank,\" is established here. Clark County is bounded east by Jefferson county, south by the Ohio river, west by the counties of Harrison and Washington, north by the county of Jackson and Indian lands. It is watered by several creeks running into the Ohio, such as Silver creek, Cane run, &c. and several brooks falling into the Mescatitak branch of the south fork of Whiteriver. Its surface is considerably broken in the central parts of the county. Hickory and oak are the prevailing timber. This county is supposed to contain many valuable minerals ; some have been dis covered ; copperas is found on the high banks of Silver creek, about two miles from its mouth. A medicinal \u2022pring, near Jeffersonville, has been much frequented, ils"], [587, "565 STATE OF INDIANA. waters are strongly impregnated with sulphur and iron. The reed cane grows on the flats. Charleston, the seat of justice for Clark county, is situ ated in the centre of a rich and thriving settlement, thirty two miles south-west from Madison, two miles from the Ohio river, and fourteen from the falls. This village, like many others in the western country, has sprung up sud denly by the magical influence of American enterprise, excited into action by a concurrence of favourable cir cumstances. Jeffersonville stands on the bank of the Ohio, nearly opposite Louisville, and a little above the falls. It con tains about 130 houses, brick, frame, and hewn logs. The bank of the river is high, which affords a fine view of Louisville, the falls, and the opposite hills. Just below the town is a fine eddy for boats. A post-office and a land office, for the sale of the United States' lands, are estab lished, and it promises to become a place of wealth, ele gance, aud extensive business. Harrison County is bounded east by Clark county, south by the Ohio, west by the new county of Perry, and north by Washington. Its principal stream is Blue river, which is navigable for boats about forty miles. About eight miles from its mouth, a grist and saw-mill are erect ed. On both sides of this river are large quantities of oak and locust timber. Corydon, the seat of justice for Harrison county, is situ ated twenty-five miles nearly west from Jeffersonville, and ten miles from the Ohio river. It was commenced in 1809, and is the seat of government for the state. The selection of this place by the legislature, as the seat of government for the period of eight years, has excited great dissatisfaction in other parts of the state. It has rapidly increased since the meeting of the state conven tion, in July, 1816. The \" Indiana Gazette\" is printed in this place. Washington County is bounded on the east by Clark county, ou the south by the county of Harrison, on the west by the county of Orange, and on the north by the county of Jackson. It is watered by the south fork of Whiteriver ; is moderately hilly, and was established in the year 1814- Salem is the only village deserving notice ; and is situ ated thirty-four miles north of Corydon, and twenty-five nearly west from Jeffersonville, on the Vincennes road. Jackson County lies west of Clark and Jefferson counties, north of Washington, east of Orange, and souths"], [588, "566 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. of the Indian country. It is watered by Whiteriver and its tributary creeks. Brownstown is the seat of justice, and is situated twenty five miles east of north from Salem. Orange County is bounded by the counties of Wash ington and Jackson on the east ; by Harrison and Perry on the south ; by the county of Knox on the west ; and by Indian lands on the north. It has a rich soil, and is well watered by Whiteriver and Petoka. This county is equal to any in the state, in point of fertility of soil, and excellence of water. The surface is agreeably undulating. The timber on the hills consist of black walnut, oak, hickory, ash, sugar maple ; on the low grounds, basswood, pawpaw, honey locust, buckeye, and spicewood ; besides, grape vines, and a variety of shrubs. The most common game are deer and bear. There is a coal-mine a little below the forks of Whiteriver ; the bottoms of which are nearly as wide as those of the Wabash, and contain evi dence of having been formerly inhabited by Indians, as the remains of their cabins and corn-hills are yet visible. Paoli is the county seat. It is forty miles nearly east of Vincennes, and thirty north of west from Salem. KnOaX County is bounded by Orange on the east; by the county of Gibson on the south ; by the Wabash river on the west; and by Indian lands on the north. This is the oldest and most populous county in the state. It is watered by the Deche, Whiteriver, Wabash, Little river, St. Marie, Busseron, Raccoon, and Ambush creeks. It has upwards of 200,000 acres of the best prairie and bot tom land, and is rapidly increasing in inhabitants and improvements. Fincennes, the seat of justice for Knox county, stands on the east bank of the Wabash, 100 miles from its junc tion with the Ohio, in a direct line, but nearly 200 by the courses of the river ; and 120 west of the falls of Ohio. It contains about 100 houses, most of which are small and scattering; some have a neat and handsome aspect, while others are built in an uncouth manner, having a frame skeleton filled up with mud and stick walls, similar to some ofthe old German houses on the Hudson and Mohawk rivers. The best buildings are a brick tavern, jail, and academy. The meeting-house, a plain building, stands on the prairie, one mite from the town. The plan of the town is handsomely designed ; the streets are wide and cross each other at right angles. Almost every house has a garden in its rear, with high substantial picket fences to prevent the thefts of the Indians. The common field near"], [589, "567 STATE OF INDIANA. the town contains nearly 5,000 acres, of excellent prairie soil, which has been cultivated for more than half a cen tury, and yet retains its pristine fertility. The United States have a laud office for the disposal of public lands; and formerly kept a small garrison, in a little stockade near the bank of the river, for the protection of the inhabit ants. The governor of the territory resided, and the territorial legislature convened here. The place has possessed many political advantages. The Bank of Vin cennes enjoys a good character, having recently become a state bank. There is also a printing-office, which issues a newspaper, called the \" Western Sun.\" The country around Vincennes in every direction, is well adapted to settlements and cultivation. Building lots sell at from fifty to 1,000 dollars a lot. There are two roads leading to the Ohio ; one to fort Harrison ; one to Princeton ; and one to Kaskaskia. Congress lands, after the auction sales are closed, sell invariably for 9s. an acre. For a quarter section, or 160 acres, \u00a318 (English money) are to be paid down ; the same sum in two years ; and the remainder in annual pay ments, without interest, if punctually made. Those who pay in advance, are entitled to a discount of eight percent. Harrison's Purchase, containing upwards of 3,000,000 acres, lying between Whiteriver, the Wabash, and Rocky river, was opened for sale by auction, at Jeffersonville, in 1817, and although the Canadian volunteers had pre viously selected their donation lots, which was given by the United States, for their valour and intrepidity on the Niagara frontier, numerous tracts were sold at from 18s. to \u00a36 lbs. an acre. A fractional section on the Wabash, below fort Harrison, sold for \u00a37 As. 10d., and several others from \u00a34 10s. to \u00a36 lbs. On the hills two miles east of the town, are three large mounds; and others are frequently met with on the prairies and upland, from Whiteriver to the head of the Wabash. The French have a tradition, that an exterminating battle was fought in the beginning of the last century, on the ground where fort Harrison now stands, between the Indians living on the Mississippi, and those of the Wabash. The bone of contention was lands lying between those rivers which both parties claimed. There were about 1,000 warriors on each side. The condition of the fight was, that the victors should possess the lands in dispute. The grandeur of the prize was peculiarly calculated to inflame the ardour of savage minds. The contest com menced about sunrise. Both parties sought desperately."], [590, "568 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. The Wabash warriors came off conquerors, having seven men left alive at sunset, and their adversaries but five. The mounds are still to be seen where it is said the slain were buried. Gibson County is bounded by the counties of Warwick and Orange on the east, the county of Posey on the south-, the Wabash river ou the west, and the county of Knox on the north. It is watered by several creeks and runs, fall ing into the Petoka and Wabash. About one half of this county has a fertile and highly favourable soil ; and the greater part of the other half would be pronounced good, in any of the Atlantic states, Princeton is the county seat ; it lies thirty-five miles nearly south of Vincennes. It has a post-office ; and has had a rapid growth, considering the newness of the sur rounding settlements. Harmony. This village is situated on the Wabash, half a day's ride below Princeton, and is settled by the Har monists from Butler county, Pennsylvania. The Harmony society have, within a very few years, made extensive purchases of public lands, for which they paid two dollars an acre. Such has been the success of these people in agriculture, that in 1818, from a field of 150 acres, they reaped no less than 6,000 bushels of wheat ; being at the rate of forty bushels an acre. In some countries, land is worth twenty or thirty years purchase ; in Indiana, a single erop pays about twenty times the price of the land. They have a very extensive establishment for the manu facturing of wool, and their merino cloth is not surpassed by any in America. They also cultivate the vine. Posey County is situated south of Gibson, bounded on the east by the county of Warwick, on the south and west by the Ohio and Wabash rivers. It contains rich and extensive prairies ; but the banks of the Wabash are iu many places subject to inundation, both from its own floods, and those of the Ohio, which sets up the Wabash several miles. Warwick County is situated east of the county of Posey, bounded on the east by the county of Perry, on the south by the Ohio river, on the west by the county of Posey, and on the north by the counties of Orange and Knox. It is a level and rich county, watered by several large creeks running into the Ohio, such a. Beaver, Pigeon, &c. It is nevertheless but indifferently watered, owing to the early drying up of the streams. The prairies are numerous, but the soil mostly inferior to those border ing the Wabash. The prevailing timber is oak."], [591, "569 STATE OF INDIANA. Perry County is bounded east by Harrison, north by Orange and Washington, west by Warwick, and south by the Ohio river. It is watered by the little river Anderson, and by creeks and runs falling into the Ohio. It was established in 1815. The best proof of the excellence of the land on the Upper Wabash, is the circumstance of its being the scene of a numerous Indian 'population. These sagacious children of nature, are good judges of land. Indeed, they are rarely, if ever, found on a barren soil. The extent of navigable waters in this state is above 2,500 miles, without including those streams that are boat able less than thirty miles. The distance between Chicago and New Orleans by water, is 1,680 miles, to lake Erie, about 800. \u2014 The surplus products of three-fourths ofthe state will find their way to the New Orleans market. Taking the state of Indiana altogether, it is to be doubted whether any portion ofthe Union can present more advan tages- Intersected or bounded in all directions by navi gable rivers or lakes, enjoying a temperate climate, and an immense variety of soil, no country can present a fairer prospect to the industrious and enterprising emigrant, especially if bred to agriculture. Near two-thirds of its territorial surface is yet in the hands of the Indians, a temporary evil that a short'time will remedy. When all the extent comprised within the legal limits of this state are brought into improvement, with one extremity upon the Ohio river, and the opposite upon lake Michigan, with intersecting navigable streams, Indiana will be the real link that will unite the southern and northern parts of the United States. The price of improved lands in Indiana is from five to ten dollars an acre, for farms containing a log-house and fifteen or twenty acres. In some instances the necessities, but in more the rambling disposition of the inhabitants, induce them to dispose of their plantations at a trifling advance upon the original price. Cotton, Spanish vines, and the silk-worm may be pro duced in this state ; and there is every probability that rice and indigo will succeed between Blue river and the Wabash. Already cotton is raised in considerable quan tities at Vincennes, Princeton, Harmony, and the settle ments below the mouth of Anderson river ; and at no distant period, the Wabash will serve as a canal to supply with cotton a part of the market on the northern lakes. Deer, turkies, and water-fowls, are abundant ; and nature has been very prolific In moles, squirrels, and"], [592, "570 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. mice, the former are injurious to meadows, but more particularly to cornfields while the seed is coming up. Constitution. \u2014 The political institutions of this new state are honourable iu a high degree to the framers of them. The constitution provides every restraint against the en croachments of power, and the licentiousness of freedom, that human wisdom can perhaps foresee. The general assembly consists of a house of representatives and senate : the former to be elected annually, the latter every three years. Any person of twenty-one years of age, and up wards, is eligible to be a representative ; the senators must be twenty-five years of age : no member of either house can hold any office of profit after he is elected. The legislature to meet annually on the first Monday of December The executive power is confided to a governor and lieut. govemor; both of whom are elected for three years, and may be re-elected once. The governor to receive a com pensation of 1,000 dollars per annum ; the lieut.-governor two dollars a day while the legislature is in session. The judiciary is composed of a supreme and circuit court; the supreme court to consist of three judges, to be appointed by the governor and senate for seven years, and to sit at the seat of government with a salary not exceeding 800 dollars per annum. \u2014 The circuit courts to consist of a presiding judge and two associates, who are to hold courts in each county : the presiding judge to be appointed by the joint ballot of the legislature for seven years, and the associates to be elected for seven years by the people. Sheriffs, clerks, and justices ofthe peace are to be elected by the people ; the sheriffs for three years, the clerks and justices for seven years. Militia officers to be elected by those subject to milita duty ; all above the rank of colonel by commissioned officers. Involuntary slavery is for ever excluded. The constitu tion may be amended in twelve years ; but never so as to admit of slavery. Tn passing the act for erecting the Indiana territory into a state, congress appropriated, in addition to the usual school section, a whole township of land for the support of a seminary of learning; aud four sections for fixiDg the seat of the state government. \u25a0'\u2022r ************ _ * * * *********"], [593, "571 STATE OF ILLINOIS. STATE OF ILLINOIS. Situation, Boundaries, and Extent. This new state, which was only admitted into the UDion in the spring of 1819, is increasing rapidly in popu lation and improvements. It is situated between 37\u00b0 and 41\u00b0 45' N. lat. and 10\u00b0 15' and 41\u00b0 15' W. long. Bounded on the north by the Northwest territory; south, by Ken tucky and Missouri territory ; east, by Indiana ; and west by the Missouri territory. In length, from north to south, it is 306 miles, and in breadth, from east to west, 210 miles ; forming an area of 50,000 square miles, or 32,000,000 acres. The form of this extensive country is that of an imperfect triangle ; its base being the northern boundary of the state, and tbe Mississippi it bypothenuse. Rivers and lakes. \u2014 No state or territory in North America can boast of superior facilities of internal navi gation. Near 1,000 miles, or two-thirds of its frontier, is washed by the Wabash, Ohio, and Mississippi ; the other principal rivers are the Illinois and Kaskaskia. The Wabash has been already noticed in the description of Indiana ; it is therefore only necessary here to observe, lhat it forms part of the south-east limit of this state, and possesses great sameness to the Ohio, near the confluence of the two streams. Several small but fine rivers flow south-east into the Wabash, entering that stream below Vincennes ; the principal of these are Embarras and Little water, botb of which head with the sources of Kaskaskia river. Tbe Ohio also washes the south-east part of the state, from the mouth of the Wabash to the junction of the Ohio and Mississippi, a distance of 136 miles. The banks of the Ohio below the Wabash, assume a general resemblance to those of the Mississippi below the mouth of Missouri. The concave bank is mostly composed of craggy lime stone ; the convex bank, low, and subject to annual inun dation. These features continue as far down as the Great Cave, (42 miles,) below which both banks become low, and in every essential quality are similar to those of the Mississippi below the mouth of Ohio. The settlements are confined to the alluvial border on the river, and the 4 D"], [594, "572 UKITED STATES OF AMERICA. swamps commence from a quarter to half a mile from she margin of the stream. The soil is extremely fertile, and Valuable, where elevated sufficiently for the purposes of agriculture ; the timber gigantic, and extremely abundant. The Mississippi forms the bbUndary of this state, follow ing the winding of the stream, for upwards of 500 miles. A particular account of this magnificent river having been already given in page 23, any further description in this place is therefore rendered Unnecessary. The placid Illinois has its source in Indiana, and tra verses this state in a south-western direction, receiving in its course a number of rivers from 20 to 100 yards wide, which are navigable for boats from fifteen to 180 miles. This noble river is formed by the junction of the rivers Theakaki and Plein in N. lat. 41\u00b0 48' ; and unlike the other great western rivers, its current is mild and unbroken by rapids, meandring at leisure through one of the finest countries in the world. It enters the Mississippi about 214 mites above its confluence with the Ohio, and eighteen miles above the mouth of the Missouri (not twelve miles* as stated in page 23.) It is upwards of 400 yards wide at its mouth, and its whole length about 390 miles. This river abounds with beautiful islands, one of which is ten miles long ; and adjoining, or near it* are many coal mines, salt ponds, and small lakes: 210 miles from its mouth, it passes through Illinois lake, which is twenty miles in length and four in breadth. The banks of the Illinois are generally pretty high, yet much of them are liable to annual inundation, and of course rendered unfit for culture. The general surface of the country is prairie, part of which is very fine land; though too much does not deserve so favourable a character. \u2014 There are five tributary rivers which fall into the left side of the Illinois, and seven enter by the north or right bank. Of these the most important are Fox river, which heads near the sources of Rocky river, and falls in nearly equidistant between Illinois lake and the junction of the Plein and Theakaki rivers, and is navigable 130 miles. The Plein interlocks in a singular manner with the Chicago, running into lake Michigan: sixty miles from its head it expands and forms lake Depage, five miles below which it joins the Theakaki from the north-east. These streams united, are to the Illinois what the Allegany and Monangahela are to the Ohio. Kaskaskia is the next river in magnitude ; it rises in the prairies between the Illinois and Wabash, is about 150 miles in length, and enters the Mississippi ninety miles"], [595, "STATE OF ILLINOIS. 573 above the mouth of the Ohio, and 124 below the Illinois, It is navigable about 130 miles. In addition to the rivers already described, the eastern part of the state is watered by several respectable streams running into the Wabash. There are many small lakes in this state, aud several of the rivers have their sources in them, They abound with wild-fowl and fish, and on their margins are delightful plantations. Nature has been eminently bountiful to Illinois, in be stowing the means of internal navigation without the ex pense of cutting cauals, perhaps no where else to be found in the world. The courses of the principal rivers, with their branches, are not less than 3,000 miles ; viz. 2,000 internally, and 1,000 on the frontiers. A small compara tive expense will unite the river Illinois with the Chicago, which, as before observed, falls into lake Michigan. Then the lead of Missouri and the cotton of Tennessee will find their way to Detroit, and to Buffalo on lake Erie. The distance, by water, from the mouth of the Illinois to New Orleans is 1,222 mites, and fo Buffalo, through th\u00a9 lakes 1,400. From Shawann\u0153-town,ashort distance from the mouth of the Wabash, the route by water, to Buffalo, is 1,200 miles, and from the same place to New Orleans 1,130. Thus is there an immense internal water commu nication, and also directly with the ocean, unknown in, any other part ofthe globe. General aspect ofthe country. \u2014 The face of the coun-. try is very much assimilated to that of Indiana; but to- wards the south the surface becomes yery level, and the point of land between the Mississippi and Ohio rivers is frequently overflowed. There are no mountains in this state, or hills of any great height. Part ofthe country is composed of hill and dale ; but by far the greater portion of it is flat prairie, or the alluvial margin of rivers. The soil is very various, and may be divided into six different kinds: lst. Bottoms, bearing a profusion of trees, which denote a very fertile soil: this land is always of an ex- cellent quality, and may be found in greater or less pro- portions on all the rivers of the state. It is. inexhaustible in fecundity, as is proved by its present fertility, where it has been annually cultivated, without manure, for more than 100 years. 2nd. This kind of land is always, found at the mouths and confluences of rivers ; it produces syca more, cotton wood, water-maple, water-asb, elm, willow willow, &c and is covered in autumn with a luxuriant,"], [596, "574 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. growth of weeds. These bottoms are subject to inunda tions. There are many thousand acres of this land at the mouth of the Wabash, and the confluence of the Missis sippi. It would be unsafe for the settler to locate himself upon this soil. 3rd. Dry prairie, bordering all the rivers, lies immediately in the rear of the bottoms, and from thirty to 100 feet higher. It is from one to ten miles wide, being a dry rich soil, well adapted to the purposes of culti vation, as it bears drought aud rain with equal success. This soil is in some places black, in others of the colour of iron rust interspersed with a light white sand. These prairies are destitute of trees, unless where they are cross ed by streams and occasional islands of woodland. The prairies of the Illinois river are the most extensive of any east of the Mississippi, and have alone been estimated at 1,200,000 acres. 4th. Wet prairie, which are found remote from streams, or at their sources, the soil is generally cold and barren, abounding with swamps, ponds, and covered with a tall coarse grass. 5th. Timbered land, moderately billy, well watered, and of a rich soil. 6th. Hills, of a sterile soil and destitute of timber, or covered with stinted oaks and pines. Between the mouths of the Wabash and the Ohio, the right bank of the Ohio, in many places presents the rug ged appearance of bold projecting rocks. The banks of the Kaskaskia and Illinois in some places present a sub lime and picturesque scenery. Several of their tributary streams have excavated for themselves deep and frightful gulfs, particularly those of the Kaskaskia, the banks of which near the junction of Big-hill creek, present a per pendicular front of 140 feet high, of solid limestone. The north-western part of the state is a hilly, broken country, in which most of the rivers emptying into the Wabash from the north, have their heads. A great part of the state is open prairie, some of which are of such vast ex tent that the sun apparently rises and sets within their widely extended borders. The large tract of country through which the Illinois river and its branches meander, is not be exceeded in beauty, levelness, richness, and fertility of soil, by any traot of land, of equal extent, in the United States. From the Illinois to the Wabash, excepting some little distance from the rivers, is almost one continued prairie, or natural meadow, intermixed with groves, or copses of wood, and some swamps and small lakes. The east shore of the Mississippi, from the mouth ofthe Missouri to that of the Illinois is bordered by hills from"], [597, "STATE OF ILLINOIS. 575 eighty to 100 feet high ; they are of gentle ascent, alter nately presenting beautiful cedar cliffs and distant ridges. The bottoms afford many eligible situations for settlements. Above and below the mouth of Rocky river are beautiful prairies. The oak species may be said to be the prevailing sorest tree of Illinois. There are for species of white oak ; two of chesnut oak, mountain and Illinois; three of willow oak, upland, swamp, and shingle, the latter species is so called from its being an excellent material for shingles, which are used instead of tiles or slates. It is found on all the rivers of this state, from forty to fifty feet in height. Blackjack, black oak, swamp oak, scarlet oak, so called from its scarlet coloured leaves in autumn; it grows to the height of eighty feet, and is useful for rails. The honey locust is sound in all the bottoms and rich hills of the west, from the lakes to the latitude of Natchez. It invariably rejects a poor soil, and grows to the height of from forty to sixtyT feet. The black walnut is found on the bottoms aud rich hills ; it often rises to the height of seventy feet ; the wood is light and durable. Butternut is a companion of the black walnut. Besides all the species of hickory found on the northern states, the pecan or Illinois nut grows plentifully in the rich swails and bottoms ; the nuts are small and thin shelled. The banks of the Illinois are the favourite soil of the mulberry, and of the plum. Sugar maple, blue and white oak, black locust, elm, basswood, beech, buckeye, hackberry, coffee nut tree, and sycamore, are found in their congenial soils, throughout the state. White pine is found on the head branches of the Illinois. Spice wood, sassafras, black and white haws, crab apple, wild cherry, cucumber, and pawpaw, are common to the best soils. The forests and banks of the streams abound with grape vines, of which there are several species ; some valuable. The herbage of the woods varies little from that of Kentucky, Ohio, and Indiana. Copper and lead are sound in several parts of the state. There is said to be an alum hill a considerable distance up Mine river. The French while in possession of the coun try, procured mill-stones above the Illinois lake. Coal is found upon the banks of the Au Vase or Muddy river, and also upon the Illinois, fifty miles above Peoria or Illinois lake ; the latter mine extends for half a mile along the right bank of the river. A little below the coal mines are two salt ponds 100 yards in circumference, and several feet in depth; the water is stagnant, and of ayel-"], [598, "576 UNITED STATES OF A.MERICA. lowish colour. The French inhabitants and Indians make good salt from them. Beds of white clay are found on the rivers Illinois and Tortue. The prevailing stone is lime. Civil, divisions, towns, population, &c. \u2014 Whilst Indiana remained a territory, Illinois formed a western part thereof; but when the former became a state, the latter was created a separate territorial government, divided into three court districts. In 1810, the population of Illinois amounted to 12,282, including 168 slaves ; in 1817, it had increased to 24,520, and in 1819, the number of inhabit ants had so greatly augmented, as to entitle them to form a state constitution, and to be admitted into the Union. This state is now divided into nine counties ; but there are very sew towns. The bulk of the population is settled upon the Mississippi, and Kaskaskia and its branches. There are several settlements on the Wabash, Ohio, and Illinois. The principal towns are as follows : Kaskaskia, the present seat of the state government and chief town of Randolph county, is situated upon the river of the same name, eleven miles from its mouth, six, in a direct line, from the Mississippi, 150 south-west from Vin cennes, and 1,000 from the city of Washington. It con tains about 200 houses, some of them of stone, and 1,000 inhabitants, most of whom are French. They raise large stocks of horned cattle, horses, swine, poultry, &c. Here is a post-office, a land-office for the sale of public lands, and a printing-office, which issues a weekly newspaper entitled the \" Illinois Herald.\" The surrounding lands are in a good state of cultivation . Cahokia is situated on a small stream, about one mile east of the Mississippi, and four miles below St. Louis. It is pleasantly situated, and contains about 160 houses, inhabited chiefly by French people. This town contains. a post-office, and a Roman catholic chapel ; and is the. seat of justice for St. Clair county. Shawann\u0153-fown, so called from being the site of an Indian village of the Shawann\u0153 nation, is situated about nine miles from the Saline river, and 307 (by water) from Louisville. It is a small place containing about thirty or forty houses, principally log buildings ; and has a land office. The inhabitants are principally engaged in the salt trade. Prairie du Rochers is situated twenty miles below St. Philip, and contains about 350 inhabitants, chiefly French."], [599, "577 STATE OF ILLINOIS. It has a Roman catholic chapel. The country below and above is a continued prairie ofthe richest soil. Besides these, there are St. Philip, fifty miles from Cahokia; Belle Fontaine, L'Agile, Edward'sville, and Williamsonville, all small places, undeserving particular description. Of the new towns lately formed we have no certain knowledge. No doubt but that the settlement of the bounty lands will produce a rapid and favourable change in this state. There are two roads leading through the Ohio to Kas kaskia. The first leaves the Ohio at Robin's ferry, seven teen miles below the Saline river ; distance to Kaskaskia, 135 miles. The other leaves the river at Lusk's ferry, fifteen miles above the mouth of Cumberland river. This is the shortest route by fifteen or twenty miles. There is a tolerable road between the mouth of Au Vase and Wood river, passing through Kaskaskia, Prairie du Rochers, St. Philip, and Cahokia. Freight from Shawann\u0153-town to Louisville, distance 307 miles, is bs. per cwt. ; from Louisville, Is. Sd. ; from hence to New Orleans, distance 1,130 miles, 4s. 6d. ; from New Orleans, \u00a31 Os. 3d; hence to Pittsburgh, distance 1,013 miles, 15s. 9d. ; from Pittsburgh, 4s. 6d. This vast disproportion in charge of freight is produced by the dif ference in time in navigating up and down the streams of the Ohio and Mississippi. The. expense of erecting a log cabin of two rooms is about from \u00a311 5s. to \u00a316 ; a frame house, ten to four- teen feet square, for \u00a3130 to \u00a3150 ; a log kitchen, \u00a37 to \u00a38 ; a log stable, \u00a37 to \u00a39 ; a barn \u00a318 to \u00a322 ; fencing, 13d. per rood ; ditching, in prairie land, I6d. to 2s. per rood. The \" Cave in Rock,\" a natural curiosity, nineteen miles below Saline river, has been often visited and de scribed by travellers. The entrance into this cave is ofa semi-circular form, twenty feet above the ordinary level ofthe river, in a perpendicular rock, thirty feet high. A few yards from the mouth you enter a spacious room, sixty paces in length, and nearly as wide. Near the cen tre of the reof is an aperture resembling the funnel ofa chimney. Mason's gang of robbers made this cave their principal rendezvous, in 1797, where they frequently plundered or murdered the crews of boats descending the Ohio. The Devil's Oven is situated upon an elevated rocky point, projecting into the Mississippi, fifteen miles below the mouth of Au Vase. It has a close resemblance to an"], [600, "578 UaVITED STATES OF AMERICA. oven. On the large prairies are frequently found sink* holes, some of which are 150 feet across circular at the top, gradually narrowing to the bottom, aud frequently so steep as to make the descent difficult. At the bottom, the traveller finds a handsome subterranean brook. An cient fortifications and mounds similar to those found in Kentucky, Ohio, and Indiana, are also to be met with in this state. Indian corn is the leading article of produce. There are some fields of 500 acres, cultivated in common by the people of a whole settlement. Wheat is abundant, ex cept where the soil is too rich. Flax, hemp, oats, potatoes, and cotton are also productive, giving very considerable crops. The French have made excellent wine from a wild grape, which grows here luxuriantly. Indian corn, produces, with moderate care, and in a favourable soil, fifty to seventy bushels per acre ; wheat, twenty to thirty; barley, twenty to thirty ; oats, thirty to fifty ; tobacco, ten to thirteen cwt. Indian corn sells from 13d. to 16{d. per bushel; wheat, 3s. Aid. ; oats, Is. l\\d. ; tobacco, \u00a31 Os. 3d. per cwt. The price of horses is from \u00a313 10s. to \u00a318; cows, \u00a34 to \u00a35 ; a good sow, \u00a32 14s. ; beef is sold at \u00a31 2s. Qd. per cwt. ; pork 15s. 9d. fo 18s. Labourers are paid 2s. 3d. per day, and board. Clothing and groceries are extremely dear. Indian corn is gathered in Novem ber. Wheat is cut in June, and housed in July. Pork for export is killed in December. The public lands have rarely sold for more than \u00a31 2s. 6rf. per acre, at auction. Those sold at Edward's ville in October, 1816, averaged 18s. Private sales at the land-office, are fixed by law, at 9s. per acre. The old French locations command various prices, from 4s. 6c?. to \u00a311 5s. Titles derived from the United States'govern ment are always valid ; aud those from individuals rarely false. There are upwards of sixteen millions of acres belonging to the United States, obtained at different ces sions from the Indians, and consequently a wide field open for purchase and selection. Congress has lately obtained a cession of six miles square at the east end of Peoria lake, north of the Illinois river. Military bounty lands were appropriated to reward the valour of the American soldiers during the late war, and which amounted to 3,500,000 acres. This tract lies on the north bank of the Illinois, near its junction with the Mississippi. They are watered by several respectable streams, and are advantageously situated, either for the Jake or Orleans trade, having the Mississippi west ; Illinois"], [601, "579 STATE OF ILLINOIS. south ; Mine river east, and lands belonging to the Sac and Fox Indians, north. This tract is of good quality, and desirable to settlers; it is inferior to none of the public lands of the United States. The manufactures of Illinois are all of the domestic kind. In 1810, there were 630 spinning-wheels ; and 460 looms ; which produced 90,039 yards of cloth. There were also nine tanneries ; and nineteen distilleries, pro- ducing 10,200 gallons of spirits. The population since that period has doubled, and the manufactures have in- creased in a corresponding ratio. The buffalo, wliich formerly roamed at will, through the immense prairies of Illinois, have lately disappeared, preferring the more distant plains of the Missouri. Deer, bears, wolves, foxes, and the elk, opossum, and rackoon, remain in considerable numbers. The inhabitants have a fine breed of horses from the Spanish stock. Their cattle have a liveljT and sleek appearance. Hogs are easily reared. Wild turkeys abound in the hilly districts. Quails are plenty. Geese and ducks frequent the ponds, lakes, and rivers. Buzzards and pigeons, blackbirds, paroquets, and several species of hawks abound as (in the other parts of the western country. Most kinds of fish which are found in the Mississippi and the great northern Jakes, frequent the rivers of this state. Sturgeon are found in Peoria or Illinois lake. The only venomous serpents are the common prairie rattlesnakes, and copperheads. The Indians who inhabit this state and its borders are not numerous ; the Sacs or Saukies, inhabit the country bordering on Sand Bay and Rocky rivers, have three villages. A part of this tribe reside on the west side of Mississippi ; their total number is about 2,850. The Kas- kaskias, Cohokias, and Peorias, are remains of formidable tribes. They have been nearly annihilated in their wars with the Saukies and Foxes. They are reduced to 250 warriors, who reside principally between the Kaskaskia and Illinois. The Delawares andShawanese have a sum mer residence four miles below Au Vase river. The Piankashaws and Mascontins mostly inhabit the Aiascon tin, Tortue, and Rejoicing branches ofthe Wabash ; their total number of sours about 600. Constitution. \u2014 The constitution of this state was framed by a convention held in 1818. It declares, that the gover nor is to be elected for four years, his salary 1,000 dollars. The supreme court to consist of four judges, who are to NO. XXV. 4 I"], [602, "580 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. be a counsel for the governor. The senators to be elected every four years ; the representatives every two. The sheriff and coroners of the several counties to be elected every two years. All persons of twenty-one years osage who have resided in this state six months previous to the election, are entitled to vote. Slavery is not admitted. Persons conscientiously scrupulous of bearing arms, not to be compelled to do militia duty in time of peace, on paying au equivalent for exemption. Brigadiers and major-generals to be elected by the officers of brigades and divisions. No religious test to be required as a quali fication for any office. STATE OF KENTUCKY.

Bounded on the north by the states of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois ; south, by Vir ginia, and Tennessee ; east, by Virginia ; and west, by Illinois, and Missouri territory. In length, from east to west, it is 300 miles; and in breadth from north to south, 138 miles; forming an area of 39,000 square miles, or 24,960,000 acres. Rivers. \u2014 The Ohio washes the northern margin of Ken tucky for the space of 838 miles. The principal rivers which water this fertile tract of country, and fall into the Ohio, are Big Sandy which rises in the Allegany moun tains near the heads of Clinch and Cumberland rivers, and forms the eastern boundary of the state for nearly 200 miles ; it is 200 yards wide at its mouth.- \u2014 Licking river heads in the south-east corner of the state, near the sources of Cumberland river, pursues a nortb-western course, and falls into the Ohio, at Newport, opposite Cin cinnati. Between the mouths of Big Sandy and Licking, a number of creeks and rivulets enter the Ohio ; they are from twenty to seventy miles long. \u2014 The Kentucky rises in the mountains in the south-east corner of the state, and interlocks with the head waters of Licking and Cumber-"], [603, "581 STATE OF KENTUCKY. land rivers. It runs a north-west course, and falls into the Ohio at Port William, seventy-seven miles above Louisville. It is 150 yards wide at its mouth, and has a boatable navigation 150 miles. \u2014 Salt river rises in Mercer county^, and enters the Ohio twenty miles below Louis ville. It is 150 yards wide at its mouth, and navigable 150 miles. \u2014 Green river has its sources in Lincoln county; it pursues a western course, and enters the Ohio 200 miles below Louisville ; fifty miles above the mouth of Cumber land river. It is navigable for boats nearly 200 miles, and is 200 yards wide at its mouth. \u2014 Tradewater river heads in the bend of Cumberland river, and falls into the Ohio, 200 miles below the mouth of Green river. It is about seventy yards wide at its mouth, and eighty miles long. \u2014 Cumberland river rises near the south fork of Big Sandy, in the south-east corner of the state. After meaudring about 200 miles, it turns to the north-west, passes by Nashville, and unites with the Ohio in a west direction, 1,113 miles below Pittsburgh. It is 300 yards wide at its mouth, and is navigable in large vessels to Nashville, where it is 190 yards wide, and continues that breadth upwards of 200 miles ; and from the latter place it is navigable 300 miles farther, for boats of fifteen tons burden. \u2014 Tennessee river runs about seventy-five miles in Kentucky, before it enters the Ohio. Besides the above rivers there is Red river, which runs a south-west course and falls into Cumberland river. \u2014 Kaskinampas river waters the western end ef the state ; it heads near Tennessee and enters the Mississippi about half way between the mouth of the Ohio and New Madrid. There are also a number of forks and creeks branching from the above rivers, which chequer the country. General aspect of the country, soil, &c. \u2014 The face of this country is generally uneven, and towards the east spurs of the Allegany, some of it is rough and hilly ; the soil is generally good, and a considerable part excellent ; producing wheat and other grains, hemp, flax, tobacco, cotton, grass, &c. The bottoms on the Kentucky side of the Ohio, from its mouth to that of the Big Sandy will average one mile in width. The bottoms are in some places subject to periodical inundation ; about one sixth of this land is cleared. The timber is beech, sugar maple, sycamore, cottonwood, hackberry, pawpaw, and honey Jocust. Parallel to the Ohio, and in the rear of the bottoms*"], [604, "582 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. lies a strip of country from five to twenty miles wide, and as long as the state, which is cut into deep valleys and high hills, by the numerous creeks aud runs entering the Ohio. This soil is rich, the greater part capable of im- provement. Between this strip, Big Sandy, and Green rivers, and the eastern counties, lies the garden of the state, if not of the world. It is about 150 miles long, and from 50 to 100 miles wide, and comprises the coun- ties of Mason, Fleming, Montgomery, Clarke, Bourbon, Fayette, Scott, Harrison, Franklin, Woodford, Mercer, Jessamine, Madison, Garrard, Logan, Casey, Lincoln, Washington, and Green. This district is gradually rising and descending alternately ; there are no swamps and the hills are of such easy ascent, that the fields shew to the best possible advantage. The soil is black and friable, generally, but sometimes of a deep vermillion hue, or of the colour of strong ashes. The depth of the soil is always greatest on the summits of the ridges and hills, varying from one to twenty feet. There is little or no underwood. In the woods the earth is not incumbered with the rubbish of fallen timber, nor the trunks of par- tially decayed trees, as is the case in the northern states. The counties bordering the Virginia and Tennessee frontiers, situated in the eastern and south-eastern parts of the state, are broken by the spurs and lateral branches of the Allegany and Cumberland mountains. Besides, it is in these sections of the state that the Big Sandy, Lick- ing, Kentucky, and Cumberland rivers have their sources. The small streams are numerous, and have gullied the earth into sharp hills, long crooked ridges, deep glens, dark hollows, and frightful gulfs. The hills are covered with oak, chesnut, hickory, gum, and poplar, and the valleys with beech, sugar maple, elm, poplar, black walnut, and hackberry. In the bottoms of the gulfs, or coves, as the inhabitants call them, the trees are thickly planted, and grow to a most extraordinary size, par- ticularly the poplars, which frequently measure eight feet in diameter, and of an immense height. Between the Rolling fork of Salt river and Green river, in Nelson county principally, is a tract of country, about forty miles square, mostly barren, interspersed with plains and strips of good lands, which are advantageous situ- ations for raising cattle, as the neighbouring barrens, as they are improperly called, are covered with grass, and afford good pasturage. Small tracts of similar land are found upon Great and Little Barren rivers. But the country between Green and Cumberland rivers is emphati-"], [605, "STATE OF KENTUCKY. 58$ cally called the barrens, by the inhabitants living north of Green river and the Knobs of Pulaski county; uot because the soil is unproductive, but because the timber is uniformly oak, chesuut, hickory, gum, lyn, poplar and cucumber. The oak, or knob district, includes the coun ties of Pulaski, Wayne, Rockcastle, Knox, Cumberland, Warren, Barren, Livingston, and Christian. There are uo meadows or pastures to be seen in this quarter ; all the domestic animals run in the woods. These lands will yield from forty to fifty bushels of Indian corn ; fifteen bushels of rye, twenty of wheat, and thirty of oats, an acre ; besides, tobacco does well in the swails and flats, which are sometimes very fertile; cotton and indigo will do tolerably well. The gardens produce onions, cabbage, sweet, and Irish potatoes. The bottoms of Cumberland, where it runs on the Kentucky side of the boundary line, are very productive, not so subject to inundation, nor so wide as those of the Ohio. The soil is a gravelly clay or loam of a vermillion colour, except in the poplar timbered lands, where it is a deep, ash coloured mould, rich, durable, and capable of producing 100 bushels of corn an acre. The inhabitants grow tobacco on this soil, for which purpose they uniformly clear a piece of new ground. The chesnut trees are re markably tall and handsome ; it is mostly used by the inhabitants for rails aud shingles. Civil divisions, towns, population, &c. \u2014 This state is divided into fifty-four counties, containing by the census of 1800, a population of 220,960; in 1810, 406,511, and by the state census of 1817, 580,000.

The main street, which is one mile and a quarter long, runs parallel with the creek on the north side. There are three other streets running parallel with the main street ; these are intersected at short intervals by cross streets ; all of which are wide and mostly paved. Near the centre of the town is the public square, lined on every side with sub stantial brick houses, stores, hotels, &c. In this square stands the market-house, which is of brick. The public buildings consist of several churches, belonging to me thodists, presbyterians, baptists, seceders, episcopalians, and Roman catholics. The court-house is a three story brick building. The masonic hall, and the bank, are fine brick buildings. There is a public library, a university, called Transylvania, liberally endowed. The taverns and boarding-houses are neat and well furnished. There are two bookstores, and three printing-offices, from which are issued as many weekly papers, viz. the \" Reporter,\" and \" Kentucky Gazette,\" both republican, and the \" Monitor,\" federal, the only one of that political cast in the state. In Lexington there are several steam-engines, two of which are employed in grinding flour for exporta tion and the use of the town, one in the manufacture of cotton and paper, and one in that of wool. The two last are upon a very extensive scale, the largest of which is incorporated by the state, under the name of the \"Lexington Manufacturing Company,\" who have an ex tensive influence, and are chiefly employed by govern ment in making clofhi. g for the army and navy, In the woollen manufactories the wool is carded, spun, and made into cloth ; but the sales have been extremely dull laterly, owing to the vast influx of European goods, which are sold at a much lower rate than can be afforded by the American manufacturer, from the high wages he is obliged to pay his workmen. There is very little cotton \u2022 Laid out sine* last census."], [608, "586 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. grown in this state ; nearly the whole of that manufac- tured in Lexington is brought from Tennessee, New Orleans, or Georgia. It is carded and spun into yarn, and then sold to the country people to make clothing for their negroes. The raw material may be bought for Is. Qd. per lb., and the yarn sold at 2s. Qd. to 3s. per doz. Carders, spinners, weavers, and every other person employ- ed in this branch are well paid for their labour; receiv- ing from one and a half to two dollars a day ; which, in a country where all the necessaries of life are remarkably plentiful aud cheap, must be considered very great wages. The manufactures are extensive and promise a continued growth of the town ; the principal establishments are, twelve cotton, three woollen, three paper, aud three gun- powder mills, one lead factory, four founderies for cast- ing iron and brass, connected with silver plating, four nail factories, four hat ditto, sour coach ditto, five tanners and curriers, twelve factories for cotton bagging and hempen yarn, six cabinet makers, four soap and candle factories, three tobacco ditto ; besides several jewellers* and silversmiths, saddlers, tailors, breweries, distilleries, cooperies, with others of inferior note ; the total amount of capital employed in them all has been estimated at \u00a3427,225 sterling. Land within the bounds of Lexington sells from 100 to 400 dollars an acre; at the distance of four or five miles from the town, where the country is for the most part cleared of timber ; farms, with suitable buildings, may be purchased from twenty-five to thirty dollars an acre. Indeed this district is becoming so populous, and the woods disappearing with such rapidity, that fears have been entertained of an approaching scarcity of fuel ; but while plenty of coal can be had on Kentucky river, at fifteen miles distant, there seems little cause for apprehen sion on that head. The cattle, horses, and sheep are very fine. A first rattwyoke of cattle can be purchased for \u00a311 bs.; and a horse worth \u00a323 in New York, could be bought for \u00a316. Provisions are cheap and abundant; and mechanics' wages are high. Board Ils. 3c/. a week. Most ofthe mechanics are in prosperous circumstances. Louisville, .the chief town of Jefferson county, stands on an inclined plain, about one quarter of a mile above the Falls of Ohio. The three principal streets run parallel with the river. It has many public buildings, several rope-walks, and manufactories, two printing-offices, &c. It is 700 miles, by the windings of the Ohio, below Pitts burgh, forty west of Frankfort, and 481 above the mouth"], [609, "587 STATE OF KENTUCKY. of the Ohio. Beargrass creek euters the river at the upper end of the town and affords a good harbour for boats. The buildings extend from the mouth of Beargrass down the Ohio to opposite the lower end of Corn island, a distance of one mite ; boats can lie with perfect safety at any point of the shore, from the mouth of the creek to the middle of the island, the river being deep, with little or no current in the bend of the river abreast the town. The eminence on which the town stands is seventy feet in height, and gently descends to a narrow plain along the bank of the river ; it is aloug this plain that the con templated canal, on the Kentucky side of the rapids, is proposed to be cut. The price of boating goods from New Orleans to Louisville, (distance 1,491 miles,) is from 18s. to 22s. Qd. per cwt. The freight to New Orleans from hence is 3s. Aid. to 4s. Qd. per cwt. The average period of time which boats take to go to New Orleans is about twenty-eight days, that from New Orleans, ninety days. Steam vessels effect the same route in an average of twelve days down, and thirty-six days up ; the mail between those towns is now carried by steam-boats. Louisville will, in all probability, soon exceed Lexington in size and popu lation ; in the spring of 1819 it contained upwards of 5,000 inhabitants. In this flourishing town, mechanics are in great demand, and are paid from 40s. Qd. to 54s. a week. Wearing apparel sells high; shoes from 15s. to 18s. a pair; best hats, from 36s. to 45s. each; and every article of clothing in proportion. Jefferson county is one of the most populous counties in the state, of a rich soil and watered by creeks running into the Ohio and Salt rivers. Frankfort, the metropolis of the state, and chief town of Franklin county, stands on the east bank of Kentucky river, sixty miles above its entrance into the Ohio. The river, which is here about 100 yards wide, with bold lime stone banks, forms a handsome curve, and waters the southern and western parts of the town. The bottoms on both sides of the river are very broad, but subject to in undation. The town is but little inferior to Lexington in the size and number of its houses ; but is neither so plea sant, nor so rich in its surrounding scenery. The public buildings are, the state-house, built of rough marble, two churches, court-house, jail, market-house, and peniten tiary, &c. the latter covers an acre ; the walls are of stone. The labour of the convicts, and articles manufactured, after paying for the raw materials, considerably exceed in value tbe annual appropriations of the state. There are sever; _ valuable rope-walks, two cotton-bagging manu- 4f"], [610, "588 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. factories, powder-mills, grist and saw-mill, tobacco war.* house, two book-stores, and three printing-offices, in which are printed the \" Palladium,\" the \" Argus,\" and the \" Pulse.\" This town is twenty-four miles north-west of Lexington. The public inns are commodious, and con ducted in the best manner. Mechanics ean get from one to two dollars a day, aud boarding is very cheap. Paris, the capital of Bourbon county, is situated upon a handsome ridge on the right bank of Stoner fork of Licking, at the mouth of Houston creek. There are two merchant flowering mills, and several carding machines, two churches, and a printing-office, besides a number of well finished stores, mechanic shops, &c The greater part of the buildings are of brick, and as large as any in the state. It is twenty miles east of Lexington, and sixty five south-south-east of Newport. The surrounding coun try is rich and delightful. Georgetown, the capital of Scott county7, is situated on Royal spring, which empties its waters into North Elkhom, nearly a mile from the town. It has several manufac turing establishments, a court-house,baptist meeting-house, printing-office, post-office, and a rope-walk. It is fourteen miles north of Lexington, and on the head of a flourish- ing settlement. Harrodsburgh, a post-town of Mercer county, is plea santly situated on both sides of Salt river, which is here a handsome rivulet of good water, and affording a liberal supply for several mills. This town contains a meeting house, and post-office ; many of the houses are of good size and appearance ; it is ten miles north by west of Danville. Danville, the capital of Mercer county, is situated on the south-west side of Dicks river, forty miles south by west of Frankfort, and forty-one south-sonth-west of Lexington. It has 200 houses, a coort-house,jail, presby terian church, post-office, and a printing-office, in which is published a newspaper called the \" Light House.\" The surrounding country is rich and closely settled. There are several mills, factories, and an extensive rope-walk. Stanford, the chief town of Lincoln county, is situ ated on a fertile and handsome plain, ten miles from Dan ville ; it has about 100 houses, a stone court-house and jail, post-office, and a rope-walk. Summerset, the seat of justice for Pulaski county ; it stands on the side of a bill in a rich undulating country, twelve miles from Stanford. It contains about seventy houses, brick, framed, and hewn logs ; it has a post-office,"], [611, "589 \u25a0STATE OF KENT.CKY. three taverns, six stores, three blacksmith's shops, and a grist-mill. Monticello, the chief town of Wayne county, stands on a dry ridge, about half way between Cumberland river and the Tennessee boundary line. It has about fifty in elegant hewn log dwelling-houses, a rude court-house, and a place for public worship, three taverns, four stores, three blacksmith shops. The country for several mites to the south, is broken, and abounds with streams and salt petre caves. The waters are remarkably pure and whole some. A lead mine has been discovered in the mountains about twelve miles south of Monticello. Wayne county is the most healthy part of tbe state. Diseases and physi cians are almost unknown to the inhabitants; but as a drawback on this blessing, they frequently experience the most tremeudous thunder storms. Versailles, the seat of justice for Woodford county, is situated on a creek running into the Kentucky river. It is handsomely laid out, and contains a court-house, and about 100 houses, mostly large, of brick and stone. It is thirteen miles from Lexington. The price of land in the neighbourhood ofthe town, is from \u00a32 10s. to \u00a35 an acre. Provisions of every kind are cheap. Shelbyville, the principal town of Shelby county, stands on Brashan's creek, twelve miles above its junction with Salt river. It has a court-house, meeting-house, post-office, and a printing-office ; and is twenty miles south-west of Frankfort Cynthiana, the seat of justice for Harrisou county, is a flourishing town, and stands on the north-east bank of the South fork of Licking, twenty miles on a straight line above its junction with Main Licking. It contains about 100 houses; and has a brick court-house, market-house, stone jail, and an academy endowed by the legislature with 6,000, acres of land. There are ten grist and saw mills within three miles of the town. The town is situ ated on a large and handsome bottom, in a healthful, rich settlement ; and is thirty -six miles north-east of Frankfort, and twenty-six north by east from Lexington. The road from Frankfort to Augusta passes through Cynthiana. Augusta, the seat of justice for Bracken county, stands on the bank of the Ohio, on a spacious pleasant bottom, twenty-two miles below Maysville. It has about seventy five houses, a court-house, and meeting-house. Newport, the seat of justice for Campbell county, is situated immediately above the mouth of Licking, and directly opposite Cincinnati, Tbe town is healthy and"], [612, "590 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. affords good well water at the depth of forty feet. It has several fine brick houses, a court-house, jail, market-house, and an academy, endowed by the legislature of Kentucky with 6,000 acres of land. The United States have erect ed an arsenal immediately above the confluence of the Licking with the Ohio ; and made this place a point of debarkation for such troops as are sent down the river. Covington, a new town finely situated ou the bank of the Ohio, immediately below Newport on the opposite side of Licking ; the plain on which it stands is extensive, and similar in soil and elevation to the site of Newport, to which it is to be connected by a bridge across the Licking. The great road to the Miami and Whitewater settlements from the interior of Kentucky, Tennessee, Virginia, and the Carolinas, passes through this place. Newport and Covington will enjoy a large share of the interior trade of Kentucky ; as Licking river, in high water, is navigable for more than 100 miles, for boats carrying 200 barrels of flour. Campbell county is gene rally hilly, being broken by Licking river, and several creeks ; the soil, however, is good and the growth of tim ber very heavy. There are large tracts of land to be sold on reasonable terms, which are well watered, and in a healthy part ofthe slate. Port William, the chief town of Gallatin county, stands on the right shore of the river Kentucky. It contains about fifty houses, many of which are of brick ; and is plea santly situated at the mouth ofa navigable river, the outlet ofa fine country. Newcastle, the seat of justice for Henry county, is situ ated in a populous district, eighteen miles nearly south of Westport. It contains about seventy houses, principally of hewn logs. The court-house is a large and convenient brick building, two stories high, and about forty feet square. Westport, is situated in Henry county, on a high bluff, near the bank of the Ohio, forty-eight miles below the mouth of Kentucky river, and seventeen above Louisville. The soil of Henry county is favourable to the growth of Indian corn, rye, oats, wheat, tobacco, hemp, sweet, and ] rish potatoes. Each family may easily raise cotton enough for its own use. The hills afford a plentiful supply of oak timber suitable for ship building, and the county is rich in fossil productions. There is a salt lick on Dren notes creek, twenty-five miles from the Ohio, at which salt has occasionally been made. Lead ore is found near the lick : and about three miles higher up the creek is a medicinal spring, which is much frequented by the inha-"], [613, "591 STATE OF KENTUCKY. bitants in summer. The grass-fed beef of this county is said to possess a superior flavour, owing chiefly, it is sup posed, to the many sulphureous licks on almost every water-course. The tobacco crop for exportation in favour able seasons, has exceeded 300 hogsheads. Shippingport is situated at the soot of the rapids, and about two miles below the mouth of Beargrass. Boats, which pass the rapids through the Kentucky channel gene rally stop here. A little above the harbour is a mill turned by the Ohio, by means ofa race. Russelville, the chief town of Logan county, is nearly equidistant from Green and Cumberland rivers, or thirty five miles from both. This town contains upwards of 150 houses ; it has a court-house, college, a branch of the Kentucky bank, meeting-house, two printing-presses, &c. It is 180 miles south-west of Frankfort, and 155 from Louisville. Logan eonnty has a great number of grist and saw mills and sine sites for the erection of water-works. There are several salt licks in the vicinity of Russelville. To the north of this town the land is covered with a very heavy timber ; to the south, barrens or open prairie coun try : this strip is about fifteen miles wide and extends from east to west ninety miles. The prairies are rich, finely watered, and adorned with islets or intersected by groves )f timber sufficient to maintain an immense population. A vineyard has been planted two miles from Russelville, by a society organized for the purpose. Cotton is raised for exportation, and wheat for domestic use. Bttirdstown, the capital of Nelson county, is situated on the east side of Beech fork, one of the principal branches of Salt river. It contains nearly 200 houses, a stone court house, and jail, church, market-house, &c. It is thirty five miles south of Frankfort. Henderson, the capital of Henderson county, stands on tbe red bank of the Ohio, seventy-five miles below Louis ville. The houses are principally built of logs, and its appearance is dull, but it enjoys a considerable share of the Orleans trade; 500 hogsheads of tobacco have been shipped at this place in a single year. The staple com modity of Henderson county is tobacco; but cotton is raised in considerable quantities. Vangeville, a log city at the mouth of Salt-lick creek, thirty-six miles above Maysville, has fifteen or twenty old log-houses, situated near the margin ofthe Ohio, on low ground, subject to frequent inundation. The inhabitants are employed in making salt, and have had 200 kettles in Operation."], [614, "592 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. Maysville, or Limestone, stands on the bank of the Ohio, just below Limestone creek, 500 miles from Pittsburgh, and sixty-six above Cincinnati. Its site though pleasant is con fined, as the bottom on which it stands is not more than fifty rods wide, and the hills in its rear rise abruptly. It contains about 400 houses ; and has a glass factory and a printing-office. It is a brisk place, being the priucipal river port for the north-east half of the state, as Louis ville is for the south, west. Boats and waggons are con tinally arriving and departing ; and great numbers of emigrants cross at this place for Ohio and Indiana. The taverns are well kept, and charges reasonable. The great road from Lexington to Chilicothe crosses the Ohio at .Vlaysville. This town is sixty-seven miles from Lexing ton; ninety-two from Frankfort; and 143 from Louisville. Washington is situated in a rich settlement, about three mites south-west of Maysville. It has three parallel streets, but the buildings are not thick ; many of them, however, are large and handsome. There is a brick jail, a stone church for Scotch presbyterians, and a baptist meeting house ; an academy, post-office, printing-office, five taverns, and several stores. Ancient fortifications and mounds are to be found in almost every county of Kentucky. Several hundred mummies have been discovered near Lexington in a cave, but which have been despoiled by the first settlers. Natu-. ral curiosities are numerous, they consist of caves, sinks, and precipices. Many of the caves are a source of never ending wealth lo their owners. The earth which they contain is so strongly impregnated with nitre that the in-. habitants often obtain from lOOlbs. of it, fifty lbs. of salt petre; and if returned to the caves after leaching, it will in a few years regain its original strength. The richest counties in this article of commerce are Barren, Rock castle, Montgomery', Knox, Estie, Warren, Cumberland, and Wayne. The precipices formed by the river Ken tucky are in many places awfully sublime, presenting perpendicular banks of 300 feet, solid limestone, sur mounted with a steep and difficult ascent four times as high. The banks of Cumberland river are less precipi tous, but its bed is equally depressed below the surface of the surrouuding country. The descent from the hills to the bottoms is abrupt, and the traveller sees with wonder alternate strata of limestone rock and earth, both from one to ten feet thick. The trees of this state are various, and some of which are of a very enormous size ; the black oak, and honey"], [615, "593 STATE OK KENTUCKY. locust denote the richest lands : they grow shirty feet in height. The white and yellow poplar, and cucumber tree, frequently measure in circumference twenty feet. The horse appears to be the favourite animal of the Kentuckians, by whom he is pampered .with unceasing at tention. Cattle are raised in great numbers in every part ofthe state. A large sized ox can be purchased sor \u00a35 10s. and a cow from 45s. lo 54s. Sheep have multiplied greatly since the introduction of the merino, ia 1810. Hogs are raised with great ease, and in vast numbers, on the oak and chesnut lands in the southern counties. The price of pork is from 13s. Qd. to 18s. per cwt. Domestic fowls are multiplied to any number, and with a trifling expense. The quail is the most common of the feathered tribe. Wild turkeys are numerous in the unsettled parts. Bears, deer, wolves, and foxes are numerous in the eastern and southern counties. Rabbits and gray squirrel are also very plentiful. The improvements ia this state bear testimony to the industry of the inhabitants, and to the value ofthe insti tutions under which they live. In 1769 the first white men, of whom we have a well authenticated account, traversed this country, and in 1773, the first attempt was made at a settlement. If any part of the inhabited earth could be said to have been peopled in \" tears and blood,\" that was, emphatically, Kentucky. Invited by the excel lence of the soil and beauty ofthe country, the whites per sisted in removing iuto it : stimulated by the dread of encroachment, and determined on preserving their best hunting grounds, the Indians defended their residence with desperation. But the discipline and numbers ofthe former prevailed ; and after many years of bloodyT war, the natives abandoned the contest, and surrendered Kentucky to their opponents. Eleven years after the first effec tual settlement, this state was separated from Virginia, and in 1790 contained 73,677 persons; in 1800, 220,959; and in 1810 had increased to 406,511, having nearly doubled the population in ten years. The number of men enrolled in the militia amounts to 52,745 ; and by the last general census, the slaves amounted to upwards of 80,000. The soil throughout Kentucky has all the gradations from the very best to the very woist; but there is upon the whole a great proportion of it excellent. Wheat, rye, oats, barley, and buck-wheat, are cultivated ; but Indian com is the principal grain reared for home con sumption. Hemp and flax succeed in many parts ex-"], [616, "594 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. tremely well ; indeed, hemp, wheat, and tobacco are the principal staples. The Irish potato grows abundantly, as does a great variety of garden vegetables. The climate is healthy and delightful, some few places in the neighbourhood of ponds and low grounds ex cepted. The inhabitants never experience the extremes of heat and cold, and the snow seldom falls deep, or lies long. The winter, which begins about Christmas, does not continue longer than three months, commonly but two, and is so mild that cattle can subsist without fodder. The approach of the seasons is gradual ; and the summer continues mostly to the middle of October. The autumn or mild weather generally continues until Christmas, then there is some cold and frost till February, when the spring commences ; and by the beginning of March, several trees and shrubs begin to shoot forth their buds. By the mjd dle of April the soilage of the forests is completely ex panded ; which is a fortnight earlier than Virginia and Maryland ; and such is the variety and beauty of the flowering-shrubs and plants which grow spontaneously in this fine country, that in the proper season the very wilderness appears in blossom. The minerals of Kentucky are iron, copper, lead, cop peras, alum, and salt. Several iron works are in opera tion, where castings are made ; bar iron is mostly import ed from Pennsylvania. Marble is found in the state, but is not in plenty ; there is coal in some places, and lime stone is a most plentiful commodity. Kentucky has, from its position, become a manufac turing state. By a return made to the secretary of state, it appears that in one year the amount of manufactured articles exceeded 6,000,000 of dollars. Of this aggregate the looms produced 2,657,081 dollars, the salt-works, 325,870 dollars, rope-walks 393,400 dollars, maple-sugar 308,932 dollars ; the balance was made up by the tan neries, distilleries, paper-mills, hemp, &c. Steam-boat navigation will aid the commercial and manufacturing interests of Kentucky, to an extent beyond our means to calculate. A project of a canal to pass the rapids of the Ohio at Louisville has been long in agitation, and must eventu ally, and at no distant time, be completed. The fall is twenty-two feet and a half in a little more than two miles. When a good canal is formed at this place, it will remove the only existing impediment to navigation from the sources of the Allegany and Monongahela to the gulf of Mexico."], [617, "STATE OF KENTUCKY. 595 The most numerous religious sects in this state are the presbyterians, the baptists, and methodists, who all Jive together in the utmost harmony. The manners of the people are in many respects similar to those of the Vir ginians, which appear in a spirit of high independence, quick temper, and frank generosity. The two vices most prevalent are gambling and swearing ; in respect of the latter the inhabitants are not less guilty than the natives of Ireland. Indeed there is a strong similitude between the Irish people and the Virginians and Kentuckians in more respects than this : affable, polite, and hospitable in a high degree, they are lively in their temper, sudden in their resentment, and warm in all their affections. In Kentucky, and in the western country7 generally, there are a vast majority of civil, discreet, well-disposed people, who hold the lawless and profligate in check, and in time will correct the morals ofthe whole. Slavery is no doubt hurtful to society ; but it is probably more ameliorated in this state than in any other part of the world. In fact, so much is this the case, that the blacks are generally as well fed, and nearly as well clothed, as the white people ; and it is very questionable whether they work so hard : certain it is, that they are much better fed, lodged, and clothed, than a great majority of the peasantry in Britain. Still, however, slavery is a bitter draught, in whatever manner it may be softened ; and though tbousands in all ages have been made to drink of it, it is no less bitter on that account. Constitution. \u2014 The constitution declares, among others, the following fundamental principles: All power is inhe rent in the people ; all men have a right to worship God according to the dictates of their own consciences; all elections shall be free and equal; trial by jury shall be for ever sacred, and printing-presses shall be for ever free. The government consists of three parts ; legis lative, executive, and judiciary. The legislature con sists of a house of representatives, the members of which are chosen annually ; and a senate, of which the members are elected for four years, one-fourth being chosen every year. All free citizens (negroes, mulatoes, and Indians excepted) who have attained the age of twenty-one years, who have resided in the state two years, or in the county or town in which they offer to vote one year, are entitled to vote for representatives, and also sor the governor, who is elected for four years, 4g"], [618, "596 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. and is ineligible to sill that office for seven years there after. The judiciary is vested in a supreme court, and such inferior courts as may be appointed by law, and the judges hold their offices during good behaviour. STATE OF TENNESSEE. Situation, Boundaries, and Extent. This pleasant and healthy state is situated between 3b\u00b0 and 36\u00b0 30' N. lat. and 4\u00b0 26' and 13\u00b0 5' W. long. Bound ed on the north by Virginia and Kentucky ; south, by Georgia, Mississippi, and Alabama ; cast, by north Caro lina ; and west by the Missouri territory. It is the longest state in the Union, extending from east to west 420 miles, and in breadth from north to south 102 miles ; forming an area of 40,000 square miles, or 25,600,000 acres. But by a treaty concluded with the Indians in October, 1818, by which all the lands west of Tennessee river, in the states of Kentucky and Tennessee, have been ceded to the United States government, an immense addition has been made to both these states, and particularly to Tennessee, in which there will be not less than 4,000,000 acres of ex cellent land for sale, at the government price of two dol lars an acre, ln consideration of this important cession, the Indians are to receive 300,000 dollars, payable in fifteen annuities of 20,000 dollars each ; besides presents to sundry chiefs of seven or eight thousand dollars. Tennessee was separated from North Carolina, and created a territory in 1790; in 1796 it was admitted as a state into the Union, and the year following the popula tion was 35,691 ; in 1795, the inhabitants were increased to 77,262; by the census of 1800, their number amounted to 105,602; and by that of 1810, the people had increas ed to 261,727. In 1817, the number of inhabitants was 340,000, of whom nearly 50,000 were slaves. Rivers, mountains, &c. \u2014 This state is divided into East and West Tennessee by the Cumberland mountains, which intersect the state obliquely, separating it into two ud equal valleys, one of Cumberland, the other of Tennessee. These two fine rivers, in their advance to the Ohio, ap-"], [619, "597 STATE OF TENNESSEE. proach and enter the main stream only thirteen miles apart from each other. East Tennessee is watered by the Holston, Notachuky, French Broad, Tellico, Rich- land, Clinch, Great Emery, aud Hiwasee rivers ; all head branches of the Tennessee. West Tennessee is watered by Cumberland, Tennessee, Buffalo, Elk, Duck, Swan, Wolf of Cumberland, Oby, Forked Deer, Obian, Hatchy, and Wolf ofthe Mississippi. The. Tennessee is one of the largest rivers in the west- ern country, being nearly as long and broad as the Ohio, of which it is the principal branch. It enters the Ohio fifty-seven miles above the mouth of that river, and is navigable for large boats 1,100 mites; vessels of great bur- den can proceed as far as the Muscle shoals, 250 miles from its mouth. At this place it is about tbree miles broad, foil of small isles, and only passable in boats or batteaux ; from these shoals to the Whirl, or Suck, where the riirer is contracted to the breadth of seventy yards, and breaks through the Cumberland mountain, is 250 miles, and the navigation for large boats all the way excellent: boats easily ascend the Whirl, being towed, and from thence the river is navigable to the distance already stated. Cumberland river rises in Cumberland mountain, Vir- ginia, and after a long and winding course, falls into the Ohio 1,113 miles below Pittsburgh, and seventy miles above the mouth of the Ohio. It is navigable for large vessels to Nashville, 120 miles from its mouth, and from thence to Oby river, 170 miles farther. At Nashville it is 200 yards wide, and 300 at its junction with the Ohio. From the falls in Kentucky to the place where it crosses the line into Tennessee, is more than 100 miles, thence to Nashville is 200, and from thence to the Ohio 120; it is therefore navigable 420 mites for vessels of burden, and a considerable way further for boats. Many of the tribu- tary streams of the Tennessee and Cumberland, are also large rivers which can be navigated to a great distance. Cumberland mountains, already mentioned, run through the state from north to south, and spurs or lateral branches extend west to the vicinity of Nashville. Their summits, between Wolf river and the Great Emery, are dreary and precipitous in certain places, and bear frequent evidences of the action of water, even on the highest peaks. Ap proaching the head branches of Wolf and Oby, the soil becomes deep and fertile, even on the knobs and ridges where the ascents and declivities are so steep as to render it impracticable to travel ou horseback. Upon these bills, Qf rather small mountains, are found tulip, beech, and"], [620, "598 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. sugar-maple trees of the largest dimensions, with little or no underwood, but abundance of genseng and other me- dicinal plants. Between the mountains are coves of ten, fifteen, or twenty arches, similar to those in Wayne county, Kentucky, already described, with the best freestone water, and covered with the largest trees and canebrakes. No situation can be more lonesome and dreary than those secluded and gloomy retreats, when found at the distance of fifty or sixty miles from the residence of a human being. The north-easterly part of this chain of mountains form the dividing line between Virginia and Kentucky. The ridge is generally about thirty miles broad ;but in Tennes- see it enlarges in width to fifty miles, and with so level a surface, in many places, that it may be called the high lands. In other parts, the mountain consists of the most stupendous piles of craggy rocks, and is inaccessible for miles, even to the Indians on foot. In one place parti- cularly, near the summit of the mountain, there is a most remarkable ledge of rocks of about thirty miles in length, and 200 feet high, shewing a perpendicular front to the south-east. Besides the great Cumberland ridge, the other principal mountains in this state are Stone, Yellow, Iron, Bald, aud Unaka, adjoining to one another, which form the eastern boundary of the state, and separate it from North Carolina ; and Clinch, which divides the waters of Holston and Clinch rivers. But it would require a volume to describe the mountains of Tennessee, one half of which is covered by those that are perfectly uninhabit able. Aspect, of the country, climate, soil, productions, &c. The surface and soil of this state, west ofthe Cumberland mountains, are nearly similar to the southern counties of Kentucky, and to the northern parts of the states of Mis sissippi and Alabama. The greater part ofthe country is broken, free from swamps, and remarkably healthy. The fertile cotton lands produce forest trees of an extraordi nary growth ; and cane abounds in the valleys and on the rich hills. Three-fourths of Tennessee may be justly called mountainous or hilly, and the east section is occu pied by what can be strictly termed the nucleus of the Allegany mountains ; the ridges, indeed, are less elevated than in some other places, but they extend over a much wider surface than in any other part of the United States. West Tennessee is more flat than the eastern district; the mountains, after their course to the west, gradually de\u00bb"], [621, "599 STATE OF TENNESSEE. eline, and before they reach the Mississippi, entirely dis appear. The hills also become, in approaching the Ohio aud Mississippi, more rounded, less elevated, and, like the mountains, are by degrees lost before reaching the ex treme depression of the valley in which they are situated. From so many concurrent causes, the changes of tempera ture between the eastern and western extremities of Ten- nessee, are almost as great as would be found, in many situations in North America, in an equal distance along a meridian line. The climate of this state forms a medium between the warmth ofthe south and the cold of the north ; it may be correctly viewed as the middle climate of the United States, and proves peculiarly congenial to northern con stitutions. There is no country in America where dis eases are so rare, where physicians have so little employ, and where children are more robust and healthy. The following authenticated facts will tend to prove the purity of the air, and the general salubrity of the climate : \u2014 About thirty years ago half a dozen families removed from New York and fixed in Overton county in this state. The unprecedented health and increase of one of these fami lies (Simon Barber's) deserves to be recorded. He left New York with a wife and eight children, five girls and three boys : his daughters are all married. The eldest has ten children, the second ten, the third eleven, the fourth ten, and the fifth five; the eldest son ten, the second seven, and the third three; making a total of sixty-SI.X, all perfectly formed, and living in May, 1816. They have enjoyeduninterrupted health. Old Mr. Barber has six or seven great grand-children, which makes the increase from one family upwards of seventy souls. Not a single death occurred in the different branches of the family, until two of the sohs removed into Indiana, in 1816, when two of the children died of the whooping-cough. Mr. Barber was then seventy-seven years of age, and his wise seventy-four, and both possessed an uncommon degree of activity, with much bodily aud mental vigour. The old man thinks nothing of walking fifteen or twenty miles, and labours occasionally in his fields. None ofthe other families which accompanied him, have had the same rapid increase of numbers; but they have all enjoyed an equal degree of health, and perfectly concur in representing the country as healthy beyond example. Indeed, from experience and observation, the country between Cum berland and Tennessee rivers, is incomparably the most healthy of any part of the western country, from the"], [622, "I 600 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. great lakes to the gulf of Mexico. Perhaps the country south of Tennessee river, from the French Broad to the Mississippi, as far south as the junction ofthe Black War rior and Tombigbee rivers, might with justice be included in the salubrious region. The southern half of the states of Mississippi and Louisiana, are uot generally unfavour able to health, but locally so. The same remark also ap plies to the states of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, and the . Michigan, North-Westem, and Missouri territories. The soil of Tennessee, like its climate, is very different in quality in the respective parts of the state. In East Tennessee the land is good along tbe banks of the rivers, and in the valleys ; the mountains are poor in soil, but they afford good pasture for sheep and cattle. In the middle part the soil is pretty similar to that of Kentucky, and the low lands in the western parts are composed of a rich, black, vegetable earth. In general the land is luxuriant, and will afford every production, the growth of any of the United States, The usual crop of cotton is SOOlbs, to the acre, of a long and fine staple, and of Indian corn from sixty to eighty, and sometimes 100 bushels. It is asserted, however, that the lands on the small rivers that empty into the Mississippi have a decided preference to those on Cumberland river, for the produc tion of cotton, rice, and indigo, Of trees, the general growth is poplar, hickory, black and white walnut, all kinds of oak, beech, sycamore, black and honey locust, ash, hornbeam, elm, mulberry, cherry, sugar maple, &c. The undergrowth, especially on low lands, is cane, some of which are upwards of twenty feet high, and so thick as to prevent any other plant from growing. Of herbs, roots, and shrubs, there are Virginia and Seneca snakeroot, genseng, angelica, spieewood, wild plum, crab apple, sweet anise, ginger, spikenard, wild hop, and grape vines. The glades, are covered with wild rye and oats, clover, strawberries, and pea vines. On the hills at the head of rivers, and in some high cliffs of Cumberland, are found majestic red cedars; many of these are four feet in diameter, and forty feet clear of limbs. The animals are such as are found in the neighbouring states. The rivers are well stocked with all kinds of fresh water fish, among which are trout, perch, buffaforfish, eels, cat-fish, <fcc. ; some of the latter have been caught which weighed upwards of lOOlbs. The western waters being more clear >aud pure than the eastern rivers, the fish ate in the same degree mora firm and savoury to the taste"], [623, "STATE OF TENNESSEE. 601 There are no stagnant waters in this state, and this is certainly one of the reasons why the inhabitants are not afflicted with those bilious aud intermittent fevers which are so frequent, and often fatal, near the same latitude on the coast of the southern states. The great business of the inhabitants is agriculture ; and cotton forms a sort of staple commodity, particularly in West Tennessee. The other products ave generally the same as Kentucky. The whole of the people throughout the state are clothed in domestic manufactures, which have been en couraged by premiums from the legislature. There are no cotton manufactories upon a large scale, but the sub ject will doubtless be attended to, as the cotton here is of a very superior quality, and being far from a market, it would be attended with gi eat benefit to the state to fabri cate it into different sorts of goods, by machinery. The principal exports in West Tennessee are by the Mississippi to New Orleans, and consist of cotton, tobacco, flour, iron, lumber, pork, &c. From the eastern part they carry considerable quantities of cattle to the Atlantic ports ; also fine saddle and cart horses, genseng, deer skins and furs, hemp and flax. Of cultivated vegetables, the most important produced in Tennessee is Indian corn. In no part of the United States does that valuable plant grow in such perfection as in the rich bottoms of Cumberland, Tennessee, and their branches. Much of this grain iu the ear, and also ground into meal, is transported from these rivers to Natchez and New Orleans. Wheat, rye, oats, barley, and buckwheat, are also raised in considerable quantities, both for con- sumption and exportation. Hemp is amongst the staples of the state, but is not at present so extensively cultivated as it was a few years past. Flax is reared for home use, but not in very large quantities. Tennessee may be with propriety considered, in respect to fruits, as the most favoured situation iu the United States. There are, indeed, very few fruits cultivated in the valley of the Mis issippi and Ohio, but what are concentrated in this state. Apples, pears, peaches, and plums, are reared in great variety, and of excellent quality : the two kinds of potato grow in abundance. Of mineral productions found in Tennessee, iron and salt are the most important. Several iron works are, and have been many years in operation, both in East and West Tennessee ; castings and iron are made both for domestic use and exportation. Several salt springs are found, but not iu general use ; the state is generally supplied with that very necessary article from"], [624, "602 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. Kentucky and Virginia. Saltpetre, copperas, alum, lead, and some silver have been found, and pit coal is supposed to be plenty throughout the state ; but owing to the quan tity of wood it is not much sought after. Civil divisions, chief towns, inhabitants, religion, cha racter, &c. \u2014 It has been already noticed, that Tennessee is divided into two unequal portions by the Cumberland mountains. East Tennessee is only about one-fourth of the state, and is divided into seventeen counties; prin cipal town Knoxville, which is the seat of government for the whole state. West Tennessee contains twenty-one counties, chief town Nashville, situated upon Cumberland river, where it is 200 yards wide. This town was named after general Nash, who fell on the 4th of October, 1777, in the battle of Germantown, and is tbe largest town in the state. It is regularly laid out, and contains above 3,000 inhabitants, with several handsome public buildings, among which are a church for presbyterians and one for methodists, a court-house, jail, and a college, liberally endowed. Nashville is, in many respects, one ofthe most agreeable places of residence in the United States. The adjacent country is variegated and romantic, and the cli mate a due medium between the extremes ofthe northern winters and southern summers, and is now a place of great commercial wealth. It is distant 741 miles from the city of Washington, 620 from Pittsburgh, 275 from Lex ington, in Kentucky, 580 from Charleston, South Carolina, 360 from St. Louis, and 653 from New Orleans. N. lat. 36\u00b0 4' W. long. 10\u00b0. Knoxville, the metropolis of the state, is situated 203 miles from Nashville, on the north side of Holston river, where it is 300 yards wide ; on a beautiful spot of ground, twenty-two miles above the junction of the Holston with the Tennessee, and sour below the mouth of French broad river. The population amounts to about the same number as at Nashville ; and the town is flourishing, en joying a communication with every part of the United States by post. As it occupies an interesting situation, almost upon the direct route from New Orleans and Natchez to the middle states, Knoxville will become a place of great consequence, when good roads are made through the states of Mississippi and Alabama. It is regu larly laid out, and contains a court-house, government offices, a college, jail, and barracks, large enough to con tain 1,000 men. The supreme courts of law and equity"], [625, "603 STATE OF TENNESSEE. for the district are held here half-yearly, as are also the courts of pleas aud quarter sessions for Knox county. Distant 538 miles from Washington city, 470 from St. Louis, 672 from Philadelphia, 624 from Natchez, and 848 from New Orleans. N. lat. 35\" 55' W. loug. 6\u00b0 58'. There are many other towns in the state of Tennessee, but most of them are little more than villages, and do not merit particular notice. Several colleges, academies, and schools have been established ; Cumberland college, iu Nashville, is the most extensive literary institution in the state, and there are two or three colleges iu East Tennessee. By law there ought to be one academy in each county; but how far this important measure has been carried into effect, we are unable to state with certainty. Education is not ne- glected, though it is not pursued with the regularity, or carried so high as in the northern states. Tennessee being principally settled from Pennsylvania, the Carolinas, Virginia, aud Georgia, with a considerable number of New Englanders and Europeans, the state of society is much diversified ; but they are fast improving in civilization and morals. They have wisely profited by the example of the confusion which took place in Ken- tucky, about land titles, and have adopted a plan to pre- vent all difficulties on this subject, and it has been of great advantage to the state, as it has held out an inducement to many emigrants to pass over Kentucky and settle in it ; but as the land laws in Kentucky have now assumed a secure form, this advantage has been pretty much done away, aud the principal increase of population is now had from the Carolinas and Georgia. Presbyterians are the prevailing denomination of Chris- tians ; but there are also many baptists and methodists. Most of them have emigrated from Pennsylvania, and that part of Virginia that lies west of the Blue ridge; their ancestors were generally ofthe Scotch nation, many of whom had removed to Ireland, and from thence to America. These people, in whatever part of the world their lot maybe cast, are always found to encourage learn- ing and science, and their conduct in that respect has been highly praiseworthy in the state of Tennessee. Those seminaries of education in which they are more immedi ately concerned, are all in a prosperous state, the colleges of Blount, at Knoxville, Washington, in the county of that name, and Greenville, in Green county, are all flourishing establishments. The local situation of the latter college is most happily chosen, on account of silent retirement, NO. xxvi. 4 H"], [626, "604 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. healthiness of climate, cheapness of board, and nearness to the most public roads in every direction. The sur rounding country is diversified with lofty mountains, and luxuriant valleys, with the woods of nature and the fields of the planter, with clear and rapid streams speeding their course to the distant ocean, and innumerable springs, ever flowing with the purest water, all agreeably conspiring to stimulate and expand, to invigorate and enrich, to subli mate and purify the yojthful mind. Constitution and History. \u2014 The genius of the people in the new states, may be gathered iu part from a history of their state constitutions. Having nothing whatever to clog their intellect ou the subject of government, which is the most important of all earthly concerns, it may be fairly presumed that the constitution will embrace the sen timents of a considerable majority\" of the people. The constitution of Tennessee declares, that all power is inhe rent in the people ; that all men have a right to worship God according to the dictates of their own consciences, and that no preference shall ever be given by law to any religious establishment; that elections shall be free and equal ; and that trial by jury shall remain inviolate. The government is legislative, executive, and judicial. The legislature consists of representatives and senators, who are chosen for two years, and must be possessed of 200 acres of land in the county for which they are chosen. The governor must be possessed of 500 acres of land, and is also elected for two years. All freeholders, and all free inhabitants, of twenty-one years of age, residing in a county six months before the day of election, vote for the members of the counties in which they reside, or in which they have their freeholds. \u2014 Elections by ballot. The judiciary is vested in such superior and inferior courts as the legislature may appoint; the judges are appointed by the legislature, and hold their offices during good behaviour. This country was included in the second charter of king Charles II. to the proprietors of Carolina. It was explored about the year 1745, and settled by about fifty families nine years afterwards ; who were soon driven off or destroyed by the Indians. About the commencement of the revolutionary war, a few hunters reached the sources of the Tennessee river, and without any counte nance from government, commenced an establishment, which for many reasons- increased, and remained obscur*"], [627, "605 STATE OF MISSISSIPPI. and unnoticed by the government of the adjoining states. These remote hunters experienced fierce opposition from the savages, which they repelled with bravery and suc cess. But the first permanent settlement took place near Long Island of Holston river, and upon the river Wa tagua, fifteen miles above Long Island, about 1775 ; and the first appearance of any persons from it, in the public couucils of North Carolina, was in the convention of that state in 1776. In the year 1780, a party of about forty families, under the direction of James Robertson, (since brigadier-general Robertson) passed through a wilderness of at least 300 miles to the French Lick, and there found ed Nashville. Their nearest neighbours were the settlers of the infant state of Kentucky, between whom and them was a wilderness of 200 miles. From the year 1785 to 1788 the government of North Carolina over this country was interrupted by the assumed state of Franklin; but in the beginning of 1789 the people returned to their allegiance. (See page 484.) Shortly after, North Caro lina ceded this territory to the United States, on certain conditions, and congress provided for its government, A convention was held at Knoxville, in 1796, and on the 6th of February the constitution of the state of Tennessee was signed by every member of it. Its principles pro mise to ensure the happiness and prosperity ofthe people. The Indian tribes within and in the vicinity of this state are the Cherokees and Chickasaws ; the whole number may amount to about 2,500, STATE OF MISSISSIPPI. Situation, Boundaries, and Extent. This elegant country was admitted as a state into the Union in the summer of 1817. It consists of the western portion of the late Mississippi territory, as exhibited on the map prefacing this work ; the eastern part now con stitutes the new state of Alabama. The state of Missis sippi, which is increasing with great rapidity in popula tion and improvements, is situated between 30\u00b0 10' and 35\u00b0 N. lat., and 11\u00b0 30' and 14\u00b0 32' W. long. It is bound ed on the north by Tennessee ; south, by Louisiana^"], [628, "606 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. Florida, and the gulf of Mexico ; east, by the state of Alabama; and west, by Louisiana and the Missouri terri tory. \u2014 Extent from north to south, 312 miles; from east to west, 150 miles ; containing about 43,000 square miles, or 27,520,000 acres. Rivers. \u2014 Besides an indefinite number of smaller rivers and creeks, the Mississippi state is watered by the Missis sippi, Pearl, Pascagoula, Yazoo, Big-black, Tennessee, aud the western streams of Tombigbee. The Mississippi river forms the west limit of the state, from the 31\u00b0 to the 35\u00b0 N. lat., or in a direct line about 280 miles; but following the winding of the stream, near 700 miles. The difference between the direct and river distance, exhibits the excessive winding course of the Mississippi. Of this distance 200 is in front of the counties of Warren, t'laiborne, Jefferson, Adams, and Wilkinson. The mar gin of the Mississippi that is contained in this state, partakes of the general character of the lands of that river, but less favourably situated for settlement than the right or west border. The hills approach towards the river, and confining the water, render the east side more liable to be inundated lhan the west. The hills reach the river, in many places forming bluffs, as at Walnut hills. Grand and Petite gulf, Natchez, White cliffs, and Lofttis' heights. The high lands pursue nearly a direct course, whilst the river is extremely serpentine. Between the bills and the curves of the river, is included all the lands in the state that can be correctly considered recent allu vian. Many excellent settlements are formed along the river, the soil producing in abundance. The width of soil that can be reclaimed from inundation varies so much that no medium can be formed. Many islands intersperse the Mississippi, between the mouth of the Yazoo and the 31 N. lat., but are mostly too low to admit cultivation. The soil of these islands is indeed extremely fertile ; but no means existing to defend their surface from immersion in the spring and summer floods, the. lands upon them cannot be of any considerable value, except for timber. The Yazoo rises in the Chickasaw country, nearly as far north as the sooth boundary of Tennessee. Interlocking with the head streams of the Tombigbee, the Yazoo pur sues a course of a little west by south, falls into the Missis sippi twelve miles above the Walnut hills, forming the north boundary ofthe county of Warren for about twelve"], [629, "STATE OF MISSISSIPPI. 607 or fifteen miles above its mouth. The Yazoo constitutes here also the present demarkation between the Indian country and that part of the state to which the Indian title is extinct. Some excellent land lies upon the margin of the Yazoo i iver, but the banks are mostly subject to overflow ; and iu the iuterior of the country \"distant from the river, the soil is thin, and timbered chiefly with pine. The Yazoo is navigable for a considerable distanoe from its mouth ; but the greatest part of its course being within the Indian country, little is known with accuracy respecting its gene ral features. The Big-black enters the Mississippi above the Grand gulf, forming from the Indian line to its mouth, the bound ary between Warren and Clairborne counties. This river has its source between the head waters of the Yazoo and Pearl rivers ; its general course being nearly south-west about 170 mites in length. Like all other streams which drain the high table land between the Mississippi and Tombigbee rivers, the land upon the head waters of the Big-black is sterile pine woods. The banks of the river meliorate, and approximate in soil to those of the Mississippi, as the two streams approach their junc tion. Following the windings of the river, about thirty miles of the Big-black is within the settlements, and affords much excellent soil. The country adjacent to this stream, however, for many miles above its mouth, as sumes the common qualities and varieties of that upon the Mississippi. Between the mouths of the Big-black and Homochitto rivers, Bayou Pierre, Cole's creek, Fairchild's creek, and St. Catharine creek, enter the Mississippi from the left or east bank of that river. Two-thirds of Claiborne, and one third of Jefferson counties, are watered by the Bayou Pierre. Cole's creek, and Fairchild's both enter the Missis- sippi, in Jefferson county. St. Catharine creek rises near Sultzertown, on the northern border of Adams county, within which is its entire water ; this creek falls into the Mississippi at the higher extremity of the White cliffs. Homochitto river rises in the Indian country, near the north-east part of Arnite county Many of its tributary creeks flow out of Jefferson county, and crossing Franklin county, enter the principal stream in nearly an eastern direction from Natchez. The general course of the Homo chitto river is south-west about seventy miles in compara tive length ; and before entering the Mississippi, flows into ii lake, which once formed part of the, latter stream."], [630, "608 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA Some of the most wealthy settlements in the state of Mississippi are upon the Homochitto and its tributary creeks. This river forms the limit between the counties of Amite and Franklin, aud between Adams and Wilkin- son. For about fifteen miles from its mouth, the banks of the Homochitto are annually overflowed, and unfit for settlement. Four or five miles below the mouth of Second creek, the arable high laud commences, and continues with partial interruptions to the source of the river. All the varieties of soil in the state of Mississippi may be seen on this stream ; and almost every species of sorest tree growing in Louisiana may be found in its woods. The river Buffalo rises in Amite county, flows through Wilkinson oounty in nearly a western direction, and falls into the Mississippi river, two miles above fort Adams at Loftus' heights. The soil, general aspect of the country, and natural productions, differ little on the lands watered by Buffalo, from those of Homochitto. Below the mouth of Buffalo, the streams assume a south course. A dividing ridge, of which Loftus' heights is the southwestern prolongation, extends itself from the elevation from which flows the Yazoo and Pearl rivers, and con- tinuing in a southwestern direction, divides the waters of the Bouge Chitto and Amite from those ofthe Homochitto and Buffalo rivers, and finally terminates abruptly at Loftus' heights. This ridge is, in all its length, the separating line be- tween the rivers and creeks that lose themselves in the Missisippi, and those of West Florida. It is also a limit of climate ; a sensible change of temperature is perceiv- able on passing this distinguishing, though not very ele- vated chain of hills. Snow is more frequent in Adams than Amite county, notwithstanding their proximity, and their occupying nearly the same latitude. After leaving the banks ofthe Mississippi, and proceed ing eastward along the 31\u00b0 N. lat., the first river of note that occurs is the Amite. This river rises in the north-east extremity of the county of that name ; and by two nearly equal streams traverses the country in a southern course, enters the state of Louisiana, and unites about two miles south of the line of demarkation between the two states. The lands upon the Amite are of three very different qualities ; aliuvian near the streams; that species of slopes called hammock, aud the open pine hills. The country on the head waters of Amite river is hilly and healthy, and well timbered and watered. It is a pleasant, airy, and agreeable region, having all the natural advantages"], [631, "609 STATE OF MISSISSIPPI. that can render it a desirable and profitable residence to an industrious people. Bouge Chitto and Pearl rivers have been noticed, aud their waters draining a country perfectly similar to that of Amite, it would be useless to enlarge upon them in this place. Pascagoula river, a beautiful and important stream, rises in the Choetaw country, and drains the space be tween the Pearl, Tombigbee, and Mobile rivers. The constituent branches of the Pascagoula are the Leaf, Chickisawhay, and Dog rivers. The western branch of Leaf river rises in Wayne county, and pursuing a south-east course, enters Greene county, and unites with another and larger branch from the north : the united stream continues south-east, crosses the 31\u00b0 N. lat., about eight miles south of which comes in, from the north-east, the Chickisawhay. The Chickisawhay river rises in the Choetaw country ; runs south, and enters Wayne and Greene counties, until near the south-east angle of the latter, where the river turns south-west, passes the 31\u00b0 N. lat., and joins as has been seen, the Leaf rivers. The united streams now take the name of Pascagoula, and flow south-east by south, forty miles, and fall into the gulf of Mexico. Dog river rises in the state of Alabama, and flowing south, through Washington aud Baldwin counties, crosses the 31\u00b0 N. lat., continues south, and is lost in the estuary of the Pascagoula. Only the mouth of this river is in the state of Mississippi. Though not so long in its course, there flows in the Pascagoula as much more water than does in the Pearl river ; and as navigable streams, the preference is greatly in favour of the former. The bar at the mouth of the Pearl admits vessels of six feet draught ; and when in the bay and river, that depth continues to the junction of the Leaf and Chickisawhay rivers. The general aspect of the soil, on the waters of Pasca goula, is sterile ; but upon the margin of the waters a con siderable surface of good farming land exists. The pine forests reach the gulf of Mexico on both sides of the Pascagoula bay. The bay is represented in the maps, filled with low islands, which are void of timber. Thick woods approach to the sea-shore, however, on leaving the bay either east or west. The border of the gulf, near the mouth of the Pasca goula river, is esteemed among the most salubrious places in that climate. From observation and inquiry, we are"], [632, "610 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. inclined to sanction this opinion. We could perceive nd causes of putrid exhalation. With the exception of the bay, the country is high, dry^ and well supplied with re freshing breezes from the sea. This soil of this coast is sterile, but its unfruitfolness is counterbalanced to the in habitants, by the health they enjoy. Here many retire from New Orleans in the summer months. In the progress of improvement, when New Orleans becomes more and more Crowded and extensive, and when suitable accommodations are provided on the bays of St. Louis, Biloxi, and Pascagoula, an agreeable retreat will be open to those who desire to avoid the dan gers, real and imaginary, of a summer residence in a large commercial city, on the banks of the Mississippi. In the interior of the country, the lands watered by the Pascagoula and tributary streams, have great resemblauce to those of Amite and Pearl rivers. A general character pervades all that part of the state of Mississippi lying east of Wilkinson county. The three kinds of laud noticed in the review of Amite prevails, and with about the same proportion. Civil divisions, popidation, &c. \u2014 The state of Missis sippi is divided politically into two portions. The part included in the under-mentioned counties forms the least, but much the most valuable portion of the state. The second and most extensive division remains yet in the possession of the Choetaw and Chickasaw Indians. The following table will exhibit the relative extent of the counties and their population in 1810 and 1816. This will no doubt-give a very inadequate conception of the number of inhabitants now existing in the different coun ties ; which at the beginning of 1819 was estimated at 104,500, including about 30,000 slaves. A very consider able influx of emigrants is annually removing iuto the country now included in this state. If the spirit of emi gration in the United States was not checked by the com mon, though unfounded belief, that southern situations were less favourable to health than northern, a very great change of local population would take plaee. As mat ters and opinions are, the stream of migration is south west. The inhabitants of the New England states re move to Ohio ; those of New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania, to Ohio, Indiana, and the Illinois; those of Maryland and Virginia, to Tennessee and Missouri ; and those of the Carolinas and Georgia, to Mississippi,"], [633, "STATE OF MISSISSIPPI. 611 Louisiaua, and Alabama. Many exceptions to this course daily occur, but this is the usual routine; and the conse quence will be, that the great body of persons who daily swell the population of the three latter states, come from the two Carolinas and Georgia.

Towards the south it is pretty level ; but it becomes more elevated to the northward, and in the north-east there are some spurs of the Allegany moun tains. But in order to form a correct idea of the surface, soil, and natural growth of this state, it would be neces sary to travel from the mouth of Pearl or Pascagoula rivers, northwardly, to the Tennessee boundary line ; which by referring to the map will be found to be nearly the whole length of the state. The first 100 miles would be through immense forests of the long-leaved pine, in terspersed with cypress swamps and open prairies ; the surface generally level, but occasionally swelling into hills of moderate elevation, and receding into vast prairies, inundated marshes, and pestilential swamps. A consider able proportion of this part of the country is susceptible of successful cultivation. The soil is generally sandy, sometimes gravelly and clayey ; it will nevertheless pro duce several kinds of fruit, plums, cherries, peaches, figs, sour oranges, and grapes ; cotton, Indian corn, indigo, sugar, and garden vegetables. Proceeding still northwardly, through the territories of the Choetaw, Chickasaw, and Cherokee Indians, there is * Counties laid out since 1810. 4 I"], [634, "612 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. a gradual change of timber, improvement of soil, and ele vation of surface ; passing from a level, pine, sandy coun try, to forests of oak, black walnut, hickory, sugar-maple, &c. with a soil of deep vegetable mould, of surprising fertility, and a surface agreeably undulating. That part of the state bordering on the Tennessee frontier, resem bles in soil the best parts of Kentucky ; but the surface is more hilly aud broken, the productions more various and luxuriant. The country contiguous to the Tennessee river, for 100 miles above aud below the muscle shoals, and for forty mites north and south, may be justly considered as the garden of North America, and unquestionably the best adapted to longevity and human enjoyment. Here is a soil happily congenial to Indian corn, sweet potatoes, indigo, cotton, garden vegtables, and fruit; even wheat will yield a productive crop. But it is the excellence of the water, mildness and healthfulness of the climate, aud proximity ofthe navigable waters of Tennessee and Tom bigbee, that render it the most desirable to new settlers of any of the states or territories within the Union. From the gulf coast to the northern boundary of the Choetaw territory, the long-leaved pine is found in vast abundance. This timber is tall, straight, and majestic, running frequently from sixty to eighty feet clear ofa limb ; some probably go as far as 100 feet. The Choetaw and Chickasaw countries abound with rich prairies ; one of which is no less than forty miles over, with a horizon apparently as boundless as the ocean. Almost every foot ofthe land from the banks of the Yazoo to the Mississippi on the west, and the Tennessee on the east, is incompara bly rich and beautiful, well watered and healthful ; a great proportion of this tract, however, belongs to the Chickasaw Indians. The soil of the richest uplands is nearly of the colour of ashes ; deep, and capable of a long series of crops without manure. Canebrakes cover the whole face of the country wherever the soil is deep ; and swamps are almost unknown for 100 miles south of Ten nessee river. The poorest species of land contains veins of a very fine clay, fit for manufacturing ; it is very white, soft, and tenacious, and free from gritty particles. There is also a great variety of nitrous and bituminous earths, fossils, marls, iron ore, lead, chalk, slate, and freestone. Coal is found on the Tombigbee, Tennessee, Black War- rior, and several other streams. Ou the navigable waters of the Chatahouche, Conecah, Mobile, Tombigbee, Pearl, find Mississippi, are immense supplies of all kinds of tim-"], [635, "613 STATE OF MISSISSIPPI. ber suitable sor foreign markets, aud conveniently situ ated for hauling to the waters. The ridge of hills that has been before described, divides the state of Mississippi into two unequal sections. The north-west section comprises all the counties of War ren, Claiborue, Jefferson, Adams, Franklin, the greatest part of Wilkinson, and one half of Amite. In the south east section are included the other half of Amite, and all Pike, Lawrence, Marion, Wayne, Greene, Hancock, and Jackson counties. These sections are of very unequal extent, the latter covering an area three times greater thau the former ; and the two divisions have very distinct features of soil, climate, and natural productions. The western border of the north-west section is formed by the banks of the Mississippi ; and this border is inter cepted by the hilly land reaching the river, as at Walnut hills, Grand gulf, Natchez, White cliffs, and Loftus' heights. There are many other places where the bluffs approach to within a very short distance of the Mississippi, as at the Petite gulf, Villa Gayosa, and Pine ridge. The most extensive Mississippi bottoms in this tract is below the mouth of the Yazoo, at Palmyra; between Bayou Pierre and Cole's creek ; between Villa Gayosa and Natchez ; and between the White cliffs and Loftus' heights, sixty-two miles (by water) below Natchez, These bottoms are, in a few places, five miles wide, which, allowing their length to be 200, would give 500 square miles as the entire surface in the tract in question upon which the Mississippi waters flow. Some extent may be added for the river and creek bottoms, which protrude the inundated surface into the interior; but 600 square miles will be an ample estimate for all the surface between the Yazoo and the south boundary of the state, which is liable to annual inundation from the Mississippi, or by other streams rendered stagnant by the swell of that mighty river. . The hilly or broken district rises like a buttress from the foregoing plain ; producing a country of waving surface, though no part of its extent is much elevated. There are but few places in the United States where the soil affords more diversity than does the country watered by the Yazoo, Big-Black, Homochitto, Buf falo, and the numerous streams in their vicinity. No part of the earth is, perhaps, more congenial to the production of its particular staple, than is this region to the growth of cotton ; that elegant and truly useful vegetable, which flourishes most luxuriantly in the wsym and fertile soil,,"], [636, "614 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. that constitutes most of the surface of the north-west sec tion of this state. After leaving the level inundated bottoms ofthe Missis- sippi, and ascending the bluffs, and for ten or fifteen miles into the interior, the surface of the country is generally composed of rich loam, and thickly timbered with seven kinds of oak, four of hickory, three of elm, two of horn- beam, also sassafras, beech, black walnut, sycamore, lime, maple, &c. All these trees are found intermingled along the bluffs, upon the creek bottoms, and, in fact, upon every kind of land to be met with in the country. The under- growth is composed of different kinds of vines and shrubs, common wild grape, muscadine, spice-wood, Spanish mulberry, &c. In a country thus richly furnished by nature, has arisen the fine farms that now pour wealth into the lap of their owners. Cotton is at this time, and perhaps will ever re- main the staple of this fertile region. Tobacco and indigo have both been cultivated ; but the former is nearly, and the latter entirely abandoned by the planters. Indian corn, sweet potatoes, Irish potatoes, and a great variety of other vegetables, are cultivated successfully. The apple, peach, fig and plum, are the most common fruit; but, as in Louisiana, the summer showers do much injury to fruit along the eastern borders of the Mississippi. The facility with which the apple, in every state of preserva- tion, can be brought by water conveyance, will operate against any great attention being paid to its production in this state, where it is evidently out of its congenial climate. Nor will small grain, wheat, rye, oats, and barley, ever become objects of culture where cotton can be raised at the rate of 3001bs. to the acre, at a price of Is. _<_ per pound. The quantity of cotton produced on more than two-thirds of the land included in the district we are now describing, will rather exceed than fall short of the quantity above stated. More than 2,0001bs. in the seed, or 5001bs. of clean cotton, has been, in many instances, taken from one acre. Now, where flour can be procured at ten dollars a barrel, or less, it will be purchased rather than made, by a people who are in the habit of realizing such very considerable emolument from cotton. It would be superfluous to designate particularly the counties in the section of country now described ; a gene- ral sameness prevails throughout the whole. Some dif ference of climate, indeed, exists between the northern and southern parts; but not of sufficient extent to merit notice in a statistical point of view : the same vegetables"], [637, "STATE OF MISSISSIPPI. 615 come to perfection in the counties of Wilkinson and War ren, wliich occupy the extremes of the section. The three species of soil, (Mississippi bottom, bluff, aud pine woods,) are to be found in Claiborne and Jefferson coun ties; in Adams there is little or no pine woods, as the pine ridge, though producing the pine tree, has a soil very different from that found in pine land generally. Wilkin son possesses, towards the Mississippi, a soil extremely similar to that of Adams ; but in the interior, pine occurs. Franklin being detached from the Mississippi, affords less fertile soil in proportion to its extent than any of the preceding counties, having more pine woods than either. But, taken altogether, the whole of this section is amongst the most valuable and productive in the United States, in proportion to its extent ; and few spots in the world will admit a greater variety of vegetable productions. The ciimate, in point of salubrity, is very favourable ; the surface is dry and waving, little or no marshy laud exists, and the spring and well-water excellent. In short, the inhabitants are found to enjoy as much health as upon any spot on earth, in the same parallel of latitude. The seasons are agreeable, particularly autumn and winter; and there is no place can be found, where from Septem ber to April the weather is more uniformly pleasant. The undulating face of the country prevents the roads from becoming uncommonly difficult to pass after heavy rains ; therefore travelling is easy, and seldom long interrupted by floods. Spring is, indeed, in all places near the Missis sippi, south of the 35th degree of N. lat. less agreeable than winter. The latter has the mildness of a northern autumn ; the former, to too much of the heat of a southern summer, adds the inconvenience of frequent and heavy rains. In the northern and eastern states, there is no season answering correctly to the winter of Georgia, Louisiana, Alabama, and Mississippi. The air in the months of November, December, January, February, and March, in the latter places, is generally mild : summer and the early part of autumn, are the seasons when health becomes precarious. The south-east section of the state of Mississippi con tains the only sea-coast embraced by the state. Except a very small extent east of Pearl river, this sea-coast is high, dryland; the pine forests extending to the gulf of Mexico. Three beautiful bays indent the shore, St. Louis, Biloxi, and Pascagoula ; the tetter only can ever be of any great consequence in a commercial point of view. The islands of Malheureux, Marianne, and Cat-island,"], [638, "616 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. are within the bounds of this state ; but they are in them selves of no great consequence, being mere banks of sand, decorated with sea myrtle and a few pine trees. The chain of islands extending from the Rigolets, or mouths of Pearl river, to .Mobile bay, produces a very safe and commodious navigation between New Orleans and Mobile, for vessels uot exceeding eight feet draught. This com merce, though passing in front ofthe state, will be of little benefit to its inhabitants, except those residing upon Pearl and Pascagoula rivers. The country included in the south-east section is yet but thinly populated ; aud from the general aspect of the whole region, it may be safely concluded, that the com parative numbers iu the two sections will remain nearly as they are at present. In addition to a great superiority of soil, the north-west section possesses many other advan tages, that cau never be extended to that of the south east. Particular topography of the state. \u2014 The parallel of 35 N. lat. which is the dividing line between the state of Tennessee and this state, crosses the Mississippi a little below the moutli of Wolf river, 376 miles below St. Louis, aud 813 above New Orleans; oue mile further down is Fort Pickering, where there are about a dozen houses: the bank on which they stand is from sixty to 100 feet high, sloping in places, but perpendicular at the points. The inhabitants raise Indian corn and cotton, and the spot on which they reside, from its elevated and airy situation, will probably become the site of a considerable town. Between this place and the mouth of the Yazoo, a distance of 310 miles, are only a few detached settlements ; the greater part of the way being a perfect wilderness. Ten miles below the mouth of Yazoo river, are the Walnut hills; the situation is pleasant, the land high and fertile. Here are sine cotton p antations, and the ruins of Fort M'Henry. Twenty-four miles below the Walnut- hills, is the settlement of Palmyra, settled by emigrants from New England ; and thirty-three miles below the mouth of Big Black river. There are several settlements on this river, extending forty miles up; but the inhabitants are subject to bilious complaints, owing to the inundations caused by the back current of the Mississippi setting up twenty miles. Oue mile further down is the Grand gulf, which excites great terror in the breasts of inexperienced boatmen, but is little regarded by old navigators ; being"], [639, "STATE OF MISSISSIPPI. 617 nothing more than a large eddy, into which, if a boat be drawn, it is very difficult to regain the current of the river. Eleven miles below is the mouth of Bayou Pierre ; the settlements bordering on this stream are rendered un healthy by the Mississippi's damming up its waters in times of floods. The traveller here finds himself iu the proper region of the paroquets ; indeed the woods appear alive with birds of various sorts. Pigeons at certain seasons are seen in darkening clouds, and wild turkeys in frequent flocks: water-fowls are numerous in winter. About thirty miles up the bayou Pierre, by its winding, stands Port Gibson, the chief town of Claiborne county ; it is a pretty thriving place, containing about eighty houses, and has an academy under good regulations : the country around it is hilly, with rich and extensive plantations. Two miles below the mouth of Bayou Pierre, is Bruins burgh, a hamlet of four or five houses. The next object worthy of the traveller's notice, is Cole's creek, twenty miles from Bruinsburgh ; this is a handsome, transparent, sandy-bottomed stream, except when dis turbed by heavy rains, when it swells to a frightful torrent, impassable at times for several days. Fifteen miles from the Mississippi it divides into the North and South forks. Between these branches is situated the town of Greenville, the capital of Jefferson county. It is very handsomely built on a dry sandy plain, on what is called the middle branch of Cole's creek, and consists of one wide, straight street, half a milo long, and intersected by two cross ones ; the number of buildings is about eighty ; the surrounding country rich and well cultivated ; roads bad, and travelling often interrupted by the swelling of the several branches of Cole's creek. It has a court house, church, post-office, and several stores and taverns. Water of a good quality is procured by digging about thirty feei. A sew miles south-west of Greenville, is the little village of Union-town, of eight or ten houses. A few miles further, in the direction of Natchez, is the village of Sulzerstown, of fifteen or twenty houses. The country continues hilly, plantations large, and the produce chiefly cotton. Ten miles below Cole's creek is Fairchild's creek, a handsome stream, subject to sudden swells, and heading near Washington, iu Adams county. Fourteen miles further brings us to Natchez the chief town of sajd county, situated 322 miles by water, and 156 by land, above New Orleans, in"], [640, "618 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. N. lat. 31\u00b0 33'. The greater part of the town stands on a bluff, upwards of 150 feet above the surface of the river. The houses have an air of neatness, though few are dis tinguished for elegance or size. To enable the inhabit ants to enjoy the evening air, almost every house has a piazza and balcony. The soil of the adjoining country is rich, and vegetation of most kinds attains to uncommon luxuriance ; the gardens are ornamented with orange trees, figs, plums, peaches, and grape vines. The num ber of houses is about 350 ; and the inhabitants are dis tinguished for their wealth, luxury, and hospitality. This remark is only applicable to the merchants and rich plant ers ; for there are great numbers of poor dissipated wretches, of all nations, and of all colours. Two weekly newspapers are printed here, and learning begins to re ceive attention. Cotton is the grand staple of Natchez settlement ; the income of the first planters is princely ; from 5,000 to 30,000 dollars per annum. Some have so many as 300 acres in a single field, solely devoted to cotton ; they com mence planting it about the middle of February ; Indian corn is planted from March to July, according to the con venience of the cultivator. The sugar-cane is sometimes planted as high as Natchez ; but not with the same success as is experienced at Baton Rouge, 280 miles further down the river. There is no doubt, however, but that it will neve tually succeed ; at least to a degree equal to the demand for home consumption. Labour is almost exclusively performed by slaves. A good negro, from twenty to thirty years of age, will com mand from 800 to 1,200 dollars. A prime slave will at tend about three acres of cotton, which will yield an annual clear profit of from 230 to 260 dollars ; the profit ofthe full grown male slaves will average about 200 dol lars, after deducting the expense of food and clothing. Sea vessels come up the Mississippi as far as Natchez; but the voyage is very tedious, and of late years not often attempted. The market of Natchez is well supplied with fish ; most of flour and grain is purchased from the Ken tucky boats. The country for the space of twenty miles in the rear of the town is settled, but not thickly, by reason of the extensiveness of the plantations, which generally contain from 400 to 1,000 and upwards of acres. Land is very high in the settlements along the Mississippi, from Yazoo river to the south boundary line, below Fort Adams ; say from forty to fifty dollars an acre for whole farms."], [641, "STATE OF MISSISSIPPI. 619 Natchez is much resorted to by the Choetaw Indians, whose possessions are within one day's ride to the east. Great numbers of squaws,* boys, and girls, are employed by the planters to assist in gathers the cotton crop. From Natchez to the boundary of the state of Louisi ana, about eighty miles, the surface and scenery remain unchanged, excepting the sugar plantations, which begin to shew themselves about the Homochitto river. The first stream you pass, after leaving Natchez, is Catharine creek, already noticed, about forty yards wide, and boat able several miles during high water. About twenty mites up this creek, and six miles east from Natchez, is situated the town of Washington, which was for seventeen years the seat of government. This town contains at the present time per haps 1,000 inhabitants; it stands in a healthy, pleasant situation, amid the most wealthy and best peopled settle ments in the state. Washington has many allurements, as a summer residence, over any town near the Missis sippi river, south of Tennessee ; it is placed in a well cultivated neighbourhood, the water is excellent, the adjacent country agreeably diversified with hill and dale, and no stagnant waters in its vicinity. The state of society is much the same as at Natchez ; there is much in both places of that urbanity which marks the people of the southern states ; and strangers meet an unreserve, found in every place where men have much intercourse with each other. One mile below Catharine creek, are the White cliffs, composed of fine white clay, and strongly resembling chalk. Forty miles further is the entrance of Homochitto, a beautiful little river, sixty yards wide, having its branches interwoven with those of the Amite. This river may at present be considered as the northern boundary of the sugar region, though it will probably arrive to perfection as far north as the Arkansas, 380 miles higher up the river. Most kinds of tropical fruits flourish about the Homo chitto ; such as the sweet orange, guinea corn, Indian kail, pomegranate, ginger, &c. The country is settled on both sides the river, nearly to the Choetaw boundary. Six miles below the Homochitto is Buffalo creek, before mentioned, a deep, still stream, about forty yards wide, and thirty miles long. Loftus' heights, two miles below this creek, stands about 150 feet above the level of the Mississippi ; Fort Adams is situated on this high bluff, and is now going to decay. There is a small village of twenty * Female Indians. 4k"], [642, "620 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. houses near the fort; but villages aud towns do not ap\u00bb pear to flourish in a country so exclusively devoted to ihe culture of sugar and cotton. Five miles below is the line of demarkation, run in 1796, as the boundary between the United States and West Florida, but at present the limit between this state and that of Louisiana, from the Mississippi to Pearl river. Pinckney ville, a village of thirty or forty houses, is situated about ten mites from the river, on a sloping plain, in the centre of a rich settlement, and about one mile and a half from the line. The country is thinly settled along the line to the Ainite river, aud indeed through te the Mobile. Besides the towns already described, there is Monticello, on Pearl river, in Lawrence county, which is the present seat of government for the state of Mississippi. This town stands at 31\u00b0 33' N. lat. and 13\u00b0 W. long. It is of very recent date, and cannot contain any considerable number of persons. As respects that part of the state in which the Indian title is extinct, the position of Monti cello is nearly central ; and being in a high, dry, healthy situation, this town is well chosen as the seat of legisla tion. The other towns in this state are small, and of no other consequence than being the seats of justice for the respec tive counties. No city of any great extent can easily rise in the vicinity of New Orleans ; its concentrated ad vantages will allure population and commercial capital into its own bosom, and prevent the increase of other cities within the sphere of its attraction. The constitution of this state differs little from that of Tennessee. With regard to the elective franchise, every white male citizen of the United States who is enrolled in the militia, or who has paid a state or county tax, and who has resided one year in the state, and six months in the election district, is an elector qualified to vote therein for representatives and for senators. There are only three tribes of Indians in the state of Mississippi ; the Chickasaws, Cherokees, and Choctaws. The Chickasaws have about 1,800 warriors, and 4,000 \u25a0women and children ; they own several millious of acres of excellent land, between 36\u00b0 and 34\u00b0 N. lat., and the Ten- nessee and Mississippi rivers, besides four reservations from one to four miles square : these Indians have always been the warm friends of the United States, and distin guished for their hospitality. Some of the Chickasaw chiefs possess numerous negro slaves, and annually sell"], [643, "621 STATE OF MISSISSIPPI. several hundred cattle and hogs. The Colbert family are the most opulent ; George Colbert is proprietor of the ferry, where the road from Nashville to Natchez crosses the Tennessee river ; it is worth 2,000 dollars a year : his charge is half a dollar for a footman, and one dollar for a man and horse. The thoroughfare is already very great, as all the boatmen who descend the Mississippi to New Orleans, return by land through the Choetaw and Chickasaw nations, and cross at this ferry. Colbert has a fine tract of land four miles square; and it is said that his bill against the United States for provisions, horses, ferrying, &c, furnished during the late war to the Ten- nessee militia, amounted to 75,000 dollars. The Chicka- saws reside in eight towns, and like their neighbours, the Cherokees, are considerably civilized. The Cherokees are a powerful nation, having a popu- lation of 14,000 souls, and 4,000 warriors. They still owu an extensive district, chiefly on the south side of the Tennessee river, to the east of the Chickasaw possessions. They raise the cotton for their clothing, and the indigo for dyeing their yarn ; they are good weavers, and have at this time upwards of 500 looms, most of which are made by themselves, and they possess at least 500 ploughs. Their lands are under good tillage, and they have large stocks of black cattle and horses, swine, and sheep ; poultry in great abundance ; and having a profusion of the necessaries of life, their population proportionably increases. By means of schools, many of their young people can read and write ; and the progress of their children has been as great as that of any children whatsoever, in acquiring the knowledge of letters and of figures. Nature has given them the finest forms ; and ean we suppose that God has withheld from them correspondent powers of mind. If a statuary should want models for the human figure, he will find the most perfect amongst the southern Indian tribes south ofthe river Ohio. About one half the Cherokee nation are of mixed blood, by intermarriages with the white people ; and many of them are as white as any of the American citizens. Their hos- pitality in their houses is every where acknowledged ; and their bravery in the field is well known to those who acted with them in the late war with the hostile Creeks. (See page 249.) A great part ofthe men are clothed in the European fashion ; aud the females without exception dress in the habits of tbe white people : some of them who are wealthy, dress very richly. They are re->"], [644, "622 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. markably clean and neat in their persons ; and men, women, and children practise bathing. The Choctaws are still more numerous than the Chero kees ; and their lands are situated between the Yazoo and Tombigbee. They reside on the Chickasaka, Yazoo, Pascagoula, and Pearl rivers, and are friendly to white travellers, for whose accommodation, while sojourning in their nation, they have established a number of public inns, which for neatness, convenience, and moderation of charges, actually excel many white taverns in the north ern states. Some of them have large farms, in a good state of culture, and many of them spend much of their time in agricultural improvements. Many years ago they had forty-three towns and villages, containing upwards of 4,000 warriors, and 12,123 souls. Since that time they have no doubt considerably increased in numbers. STATE OF LOUISIANA. Situation, Boundaries, and Extent. Before entering on a detailed description of the state of Louisiana as it now exists, it may not be improper to point out the distinction between Louisiana in its extended sense, and the present state cf that name, as created by Congress in the year 1812. The country of Louisiana, as formerly possessed by France and Spain, and now held by the United States, may be considered as bordering on the British possessions of Upper Canada ; being bounded north aud north-west by the high lands which divide the waters that fall into the river St. Lawrence and Hudson's bay, from those which fall into the Mississippi ; west by the Rocky mountains, distant from Mississippi river 1,400 miles; (these moun tains turn the waters on the west of them to the Pacific, and those on the east fo the Atlantic ocean), south, by the gulf of Mexico ; and east, by the river Mississippi. It extends from the gulf of Mexico, in lat. 28\u00b0, to 48\u00b0 N. and from W. long. 12\u00b0 50' to 35\u00b0; being 1,497 miles long from north to south, and, though the western boundary has not yet been exactly defined, the breadth may be assumed at about 900 miles. Its area is not less than l,026,312square miles, gr 656,839,680 acres."], [645, "623 STATE OF LOUISIANA. This immense territory was purchased by Congress from the French government, in the year 1803, for fifteen millions of dollars, payable iu fifteen years at one million annually; the cost of which does not amount to quite five farthings an acre, or \u00a33 6s. Sd. sterling per square mile ! From whence it appears, that, at this price, the national debt of England would purchase about seven worlds, each as large as this we inhabit ! Thus has been obtained, without bloodshed, the greatest conquest ever gained by man ; and has atforded the world an opportu nity of judging whether the new method of acquiring territory by purchase, or the old method, by the sword, is the most desirable. In December, 1803, when the United States took posses sion of this vast region, it was temporarily divided into two territories, viz. the territory of Orleans, and that of Louisiana. It has since been new modelled, the southern part having been formed into the state of Louisiana, of which New Orleans is the capital, and the northern into the territory of Missouri, chief town St. Louis. The state of Louisiana, as it now politically exists, is situated between 29* and 33\u00b0 N. lat., and 12\u00b0 and 17\u00b0 W. long. ; and is bounded north and west by the Missouri territory; south, by the gulf of Mexico; and east by the state of Mississippi. It extends from north to south 240 miles, and from east to west 210 miles ; containing 48,000 square miles, or 30,540,000 acres. Its boundaries are thus defined by act of Congress : \u2014 \" Beginning at the mouth of the river Sabine, thence by a line to be drawn along the middle of said river, including all islands to the 32\u00b0 of N. lat. ; thence due north to the northernmost part ofthe 33\u00b0 ofN lat.; thence along the said parallel of latitude, to the Mississippi river, thence down said river to the river Iberville, and from thence along the Iberville and lakes Maurepas and Pontchartrain to the gulf of Mexico ; thence bounded by said gulf to the place of beginning, including all islands within three leagues of the coast.\" By a sub sequent law, that part of West Florida lying between the rivers Mississippi, Iberville, and Pearl, and the 31st de gree of N. lat., containing about 6,000,000 acres, has been annexed to Louisiana, Rivers and lakes \u2014 The rivers of this state empty them selves into the gulf of Mexico, the Mississippi, and lake Pontchartrain. Pearl river rises in the Choetaw country, near lat. 33\u00b0"], [646, "624 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. N. and pursues a south-west course for sixty miles, thence east 150 miles, until it falls iuto lake Borgne, a little to the east of Pontchartrain. It is navigable 150 miles, and has seven feet water at its entrance, but deepens at the dis- tance of two miles from the lake : the navigation is at pre- sent obstructed by logs of timber and drift-wood. It flows through a fertile district, and separates the state of Louisi- ana from that of Mississippi. Chefuncti, a small river, having its source near the parallel of 31' N. lat. falls into lake Pontchartrain at Madisonville ; it is boatable thirty miles. The Pongipaho, another small river, enters the lake about ten miles further west. The bayous Castain, Lacombe, and Boucsouca are also tributaries of this lake. Amite river heads iu the state of Mississippi, and runs south into the Iberville : it is navigable for boats and canoes nearly to its head. The road from Madison te Natchez crosses its head branches. The Ticfah, thirty- five miles long, rises to the east of the Amite, and runs south into lake Maurepas. Iberville river is properly one of the decharges of the Mississippi ; it leaves the Mississippi twenty miles below Baton Rouge, and runs east into lake Maurepas. It is only about three months in a year that it is navigable, and then by vessels drawing less than three feet water ; and is perfectly dry during the remainder of the year, from the Mississippi te the entrance of the Amite, a distance of twenty miles. The Mississippi waters the eastern frontier of Louisiana, from latitude 33\u00b0 to 3T, where it enters the state through which it passes by various channels, into the gulf of Mexico. The distance from lat. 31\u00b0 to the Balize or mouth ofthe main branch of this river, is 354 miles. The Bayous which leave the Mississippi and fall into the gulf of Mexieo to the west of the Balize, are Bayou Atchafalaya, leaves the river three miles below the mouth of Red river, aud enters the gulf near Vermil- lion bay. It is large, but rendered unnavigable by an immense floating bridge, or raft across it, formed by the gradual accumulation of drift wood. It is many leagues in length, and so firm and compact in some places, that cattle and horses are driven over it. It is the opinion of some travellers, that this bayou was anciently the only passage of the Mississippi to the sea ; but Schultz has sug gested a more probable hypothesis, which is, that it was formerly a continuation of Red river. The water which descends this channel passes under the bridge, and in"], [647, "625 STATE OF LOUISIANA. many places may be seen whirling through small holes and crevices, aud at last rushes forth with considerable violence. In times of inundation small I oat can pass the bridge by keeping on the flats. Large loa.s drawn into the vortex of this Bayou, find it difficult to regain the Mississippi. Bayou Placquemine, leaves the Mississippi eight miles below the outlet of the Iberville on the opposite shore, aud communicates with the gulf, through Freshwater bay, Atchafalaya aud la Fourche ; it is about seventy yards wide, and navigable for boats. Bayou La Fourche leaves the Mississippi thirty-two miles below Bayou Placquemine, and communicates with the gulf by two mouths a short distance to the west of lake Wachas. Iu the old French maps this stream is called La Riveire des Catamaches. It is navigable at certain seasons for vessels of sixty tons burden. In addition to the above, numerous short bayous, canals, and passes, leave the main branch ofthe Mississippi, between the out let of La Fourche and the Balize. Bayou Sara and Thompson's creek, water the Feliciana district, between Baton Rouge and fort Adams. They are about forty miles long, and sixty yards wide at their mouths ; they run parallel with each other and enter the Mississippi twelve miles apart ; the first a little above point Coupee, and the last seven miles below. The small rivers, Teche, Vermillion, Mermanto, and Caleasu, water the Attacapas and Opelousas countries, and fall into the gulf between Atchafalaya and the mouth of the Sabine. The Sabine forms the boundary between Louisiana and the Spanish province of Texas; it enters the gulf 250miles west of the Balize, and is navigable 280 miles. About thirty-five miles from its mouth and a little above the Sabine lake it receives the river Natchez. Red river rises in Mexico, near the sources of Rio del Norte, and meanders in a southeastern direction from the north-west corner of the state to the Mississippi, which ft enters in N. lat. 31\u00b0 5' and where it is 400 yards wide. Its waters are brackish, ofa reddish colour, tinged by the red soil of its banks high up the river. It is navigable 1,500 miles, and although never departing but a few mites from the line of its general course, is nevertheless crooked. The banks are overflowed in spring to a great extent, and in some places to the depth of ten or fifteen feet. The rapid 135 miles from its mouth, is impassable iu dry sea sons with loaded boats. This rapid is occasioned by a"], [648, "626 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. ledge of soft rock, which crosses the river. This rock is of the consistence of pipe clay ; so that the obstructions could be easily removed. Its bottoms, or rather prairies, are wide and rich. Thirty mites from its mouth it receives Black river, a large and navigable stream, which winds 200 miles through the state, nearly equidistant between the Mississippi and Red river. This river branches fifty miles from its mouth into the Barchelet and Washita forks. The north fork of Red river is a considerable stream, and joins the main branch about 100 miles above the entrance of Black river. The Dacheet and Saline are the most remarkable branches of Red river proper. The first waters a great range of rich soil, which forms the north-west angle of Louisiana. The Saline is a valuable salt flat, from which any quantity of that mineral could be produced, that the population of the state could require. About 300 miles above Natchitoches, the navigation of this river is totally obstructed by rafts or coverings of driftwood, at intervals, for seventeen leagues, and so exactly do these bridges resemble the common bottoms, in soil, brushwood, and trees, that the traveller could cross tbem, unconscious of their existence. Towards its head the current narrows to the width of a small creek, in consequence of the rocks and precipices, which prevent its expansion. Black river is large and winding ; its course is nearly parallel with the Mississippi, to the distance of about forty miles ; the name of Black river, at the distance of sixty miles is changed, and it is then called the Washita river ; here its course bends to the westward. The Washita receives the Tensaw from the east, and the Occatohoola from the west at the same place. In the year 1799, the fish of Black river perished in consequence of the stagna tion of its waters, caused by an inundation of the river Mississippi. The chain of lakes which wash the eastern side of the island of New Orleans, consist of Maurepas, Pontchar train, and Borgne. Lake Maurepas lies about twenty miles north of New Orleans, and is twelve miles long and eight wide. It re ceives and discharges the river Amite and the little river of Ticfah. Nine miles further east is lake Pontchartrain, which lies immediately behind the city of New Orleans. It is about thirty-five miles long, and twenty-five wide, and generally from ten to fifteen feet deep. This lake receives the little"], [649, "627 STATE OF LOUISIANA. livers Pongipaho, and Chefuncti, as well as the bayous Castain, Lacombe, and Boncsouca. Lake Borgne lies still further east, but by a deep bay approaches to within a few miles of the Mississippi, with which it communicates by means of a bayou and Vilere's canal. The margius of all these lakes are in most places low and marshy. Lake Wachas lies to the west of the Mississippi, and twenty-two mites from New Orleans. It is twenty-three miles long aud six wide, and communicates with the gulf by several outlets. Calcasu lake lies near the mouth of tbe river of the same name, and is thirty-five miles in circumference. Forty miles below Natchitoches is lake Occasse ; and near this town are two large lakes, one a mile, and the other six miles distant; they communicate with Red river by means of bayous. When the river is high, the water flows back into the lakes. The immense number of fowl which abound in these lakes, during the winter, almost exceeds credibility; the air is darkened with the large flights, especially near the close of day, and the ear almost stunned with the noise they make. One man may kill many hundreds in an afternoon. The fish consist principally of the cat, pike, buffalo, sucker, and white and black perch, and are generally of a very large size. Lake Noiz lies ten miles above Natchitoches, and is fifty mites in circumference. It discharges its waters into the Bayou Rigula de Bondieu, a tributary of Red river, which comes in three miles above Natchitoches. All the salt used by the inhabitants of the Red river settlements, is made near lake Noiz : the water is so highly impreg nated with salt as to require very little boiling. Eight miles further up, is Spanish lake, also about fifty mites in circumference, which rises and falls with the river. Above this, at the distance of twenty leagues, is lake Bistineau, which is about sixty miles long, extending parallel with the river, at the distance of from three to fifteen miles. This lake has double outlets, and receives numerous tribu tary streams. Sabine lake is twenty-five miles long and twelve wide ; it receives and discharges the river of the same name, and lies about twelve miles from the gulf of Mexico. Catta hoola lake, near the mouth of Washita, is a charming body of water, forty miles in circumference. Barataria lake lies west of the Balize, one hundred miles below New- Orleans. NO. XXVII. 4 L"], [650, "628 UNITED STAfES OF AB1ERICA. General aspect of the country, soil, productions, and climate.\u2014 The surface of this state is level from the gulf of Mexico to Red river, above 240 miles, which includes a vast alluvial tract, extending from lake Borgne to the Sabine river, 250 miles long, and from seventy to 140 miles wide. This extensive district, is intersected by nu merous rivers, bayous, creeks, lagoons, aud lakes, divid ing the country into a great number of islands, very un equal in size and figure. The island of New Orleans, formed by the Iberville and lakes on the east, aud Hie Mississippi on the west, is 144 miles in length and averages about twelve in breadtb ; and those formed by the bayous Lafourche, Placquemine, and Atchafalaya, are very large. The country about the Balize for thirty miles is one con tinued swamp, destitute of trees, and covered with a coarse species of reeds four or .five feet deep. Nothing can be more dreary than the prospect from a ship's mast head while passing this immense waste, where the eye gains no relief, but ranges over a boundless horizon of pestilential marsh. The soil gradually becomes firmer as we ascend the streams, all of which have narrow strips of rich tillable laud, from half a mile to a mile and a half wide ; but these bottoms uniformly incline from the Missis sippi and its bayous; consequently, when they overflow their banks the waters recede to the low grounds in the rear of the bottoms, where they either stagnate, and form permanent swamps, or cut for themselves distinct chan nels to the gulf of Mexico : hence the origin ofthe nume rous bayous. This singular country, therefore, instead of having dividing ridges between the streams, has a sur face considerably depressed below the level of the river banks, to receive the superabundant waters. The country between the Mississippi, Iberville, and Pearl rivers, and N. lat. 31\u00b0, is an important part of the state ; the southern part of this extensive district isa level, fine country, and highly productive for cotton, sugar, rice, Indian corn, and indigo. The banks of all the streams are low, and the current of the waters sluggish ; good spriugs are scarce ; but from Baton Rouge to Pinck neyville, about fifty miles in a direct line, the country pre sents an undulating surface, covered with a heavy growth of the best kinds of timber. The district of Feliciana is considered by many as the garden of Louisiana. All the creeks which enter the Mississippi above Baton Rouge are liable to be suddenly swelled to the size of rivers during heavy showers. At the distance of tweuty miles from Baton Rouge to the east, the fine lands commence,"], [651, "629 STATE OF LOUISIANA. and forming a barrier between the white settlements and the Choetaw nation, extend to Pearl river. These lands are the most healthful of any in Louisiana; they have a pretty undulating surface, and although the soil is light and sandy, it is highly productive. The northern coasts of the lakes Maurepas, Pontchartrain, and Borgne, are generally dry aud healthful; the land east and west of Madisou ville, twenty-nine miles above New Orleans, along the borders of the lakes, is a sandy plain, extending in places twenty miles from their shores, and nearly as level as the ocean, which appears to have receded from it; tho southern banks are low and marshy. Much ofthe wild lands in this state are finely timbered with pine, live oak, cypress, magniola,* bay, cottonwood, ash, willow, &c. and occasionally impervious cane-brakes, which always grow in a rich, deep, dry soil. From the pine timber, which is remarkably tall and straight, many of the inhabitants gain a livelihood by making tar and pitch, which they sell in New Orleans. The vast forests of pine between lake Pontchartrain and the Choetaw j*country, will furnish an inexhaustible supply of these articles for a century to come. The beaches of the lakes are furnished with an immense quantity of muscle shells, from which lime of the best quality is produced. The fish of the lakes and rivers, and the game of the forests, are plentiful, but inferior in quality. The swamps skirting Pearl river, for eight or ten miles from its mouths, are too subject to inundation to admit of extensive settlements, until protected by levees,^ when the banks of its channel will no doubt present flourishing sugar and cotton plantations. The lowest grounds are covered with a heavy growth of cypress trees, and in the rear of these groves are found strips of the richest land, rendered almost impassable by the reed cane, from half an inch to two inches in diameter, and from six to thirty-five feet in height. At the distance of seventy-five miles from the mouths of this river, the country assumes an uneven * The Laurel Magniola is the beauty of the forest, and rises 100 feet and often much higher. The trunk is perfectly erect, rising in the form of a beautiful column, with a head resembling an obtuse cone. The flowers, which are on the extremity of the branches, are large, white, and expanded like a rose ; and when fully spread, they are from six tea. nine inches in diameter, and have a most delicious fragrance. t Levees are embankments formed on the margin of the Mississippi, and those of its bayous, to prevent their currents overflowing the plantations during tho periodical floods. The principal levee commences at the head of the island of New Orleans, and extends 130 imiles up the river. These embankments may in most places be msde.for SOO to 1,000 dollars a mile; but in inanj they would (test several thousands. T_\u00bby are often lined with two rows of orange trees."], [652, "630 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. surface, which it maintains, with the exception of a few Savannahs, to tho Mississippi. The savaunahs in this country are of two very different kinds ; the one is to be found in the pine lands, and not withstanding the black appearance of the soil, there is as much white barren sand intermixed as in the higher lands: in wet weather, the roads leading through them are almost impassable. The other Savannahs differ widely from these; they consist ofa high ground, often with small gentle risings in them, and there is generally a rivulet a| oue end, often at both ends of them. The soil is here j very fertile ; aud iu some places there are fossil shells in great numbers ; iu others flint ; in others again chalk and sand. The banks of the Bougue Chitto, a respectable tribu tary of Pearl river, are in many places bordered by rich and extensive prairies, which afford an inexhaustible pas turage to vast droves of cattle belonging to the white settlers and to the Choetaw Indians. These prairies are remarkable chiefly sor the immense number of strawberries which they produce, of superior size and flavour. The great valley of the river Washita extends far beyond the northern boundary of this state, with an average width of fifty miles. This river, winds above 3U0 miles through an alluvial region, and together with its numerous bayous, lakes, and tributary streams, chequers 6,000,000 of acres into a net-work of natural canals, affording in the aggre gate more than 1,500 miles of easy internal navigation. The country is alluvial and flat, from Red river to the beautiful lake Ocatahoola, a distance of 320 mites, the waters sluggish, and the currents of the streams less than one mile an hour. The floods of the Mississippi have been known to cause a stagnation in the current of the Washita for more than 100 miles. Above Ocatahoola the waters have a brisker motion, and it is there that the high land and permanent strata of soil commence. Between the Washita and the Mississippi there are large tracts of fine cotton and sugar lands ; especially above bayou Barchelet. But the garden of the Washita bottoms in cludes Bostrop's grant, twelve leagues square, lying on the bayou7i Sicard, Bartholemy, and Washita. This tract is mostly high prairie, interspersed with woodland, the soil rich, and the country delightful; yet the inhabitants are mostly poor and indolent, and frequently intrude upon the public lands. The wealth wbich annually scats out of Red river to New Orleans market is absolutely incredible ; even at th^a"], [653, "f STATE OF LOUISIANA. 631 early period ofthe settlements, when it may be said that the capacity ofthe country to produce is but imperfectly understood ; when not the tenth part of its natural re sources are put in requisition by the hand of industry ; when a great proportion of the inhabitants are poor, and all of them comparatively indolent, yet the trade of this river is already astonishing. Indeed the rapid progress of improvement throughout the different settlements on the banks of this important river, are almost beyond belief. At (he town of Alexandria, situated half a mile below the falls, and 104 from Natchez, there are twenty mercantile establishments, whose imports amount to 300,000 dollars, per annum. In the year 1818, the crops of the parish of Rapides, in which Alexandria is situated, amounted to 400,000 dollars, at the prices at which cotton was then selling ; and land, which in 1806 was bought for half a dollar an aefe, has been sold, in a tract of 800 acres, at twenty-eight dollars an acre, and considered cheap at that price. Red river pursues a very serpentine course. The coun try at short intervals on both sides, from its mouth to the Missouri boundary, is interspersed with lakes, a part of which have been described ; but the total of them exceeds forty. They all communicate with the river by bayous, and rise and fall with it : these lakes, bayous, and tribu tary rivers canal the country in every direction, and greatly facilitate the transportation of goods, produce, timber, &c. The bottoms are from one to ten miles wide, very rich in soil and productions, and abounding with valuable timber and grape vines. The settlements extend from the mouth of the river, generally on both sides, as far as the great jam of drift wood, a distance of nearly 200 miles. These settlements are distinguished by the names of Baker's Station, Avoyelles, Holmes' Station, Rapide, Gilford's Station, Cane river, Natchitoches, and Bayou Pierre. Above Baker's Station is a prairie nearly forty miles in circumference. It is entirely destitute of trees or shrubs, but produces an excellent grass for fattening cattle. The beef is said to be of a fine quality; and hogs find in the roots and nuts an abundant food. The inhabitants, who are Spanish, Irish, French, and Americans, are settled in the outer skirts, on the border ofthe woods. A few miles above this prairie, the land becomes moderately hilly, The pine woods are here between thirty and forty miles wide, extending to the great prairies of Opelousas. Holmes' Station is forty miles above Baker's. The land"], [654, "632 DICITED STATES OF AMERICA. produces, sugar, cotton, corn, and tobacco in perfection. On the south side of the river is a large body of rich land reaching to the Opelousas, which is watered and drained by two large bayous called Bayou Robert and Bayou Au Breuf. Their waters are very clear, and take their rise in the high pine hills between Red river and the Sabine. These afford a safe communication with the gulf of Mexico, for an extensive range of country. It is believed that this body of land, which is about forty miles square, for richness of soil, growth of timber, excellence of water, salubrity of climate, e.xteut and convenience of naviga- tion, is not excelled by any tract of land in Louisiana. From Holmes' Station to the Bayou Rapide is thirty miles. The lands on this bayou are nearly of the same quality with that on the bayous Robert and Au B\u0153uf. These lands feed vast herds of stock. This bayou has two mouths, which enter Red river about twenty miles apart, forming a curviture somewhat in the shape of a half-moon. A large creek of pure water enters the stream, upou which are several saw-mills, and groves of pine timber. Boats cannot pass round this curviture on ac- count of obstructions formed by rafts of driftwood, but can ascend from the lower part more than half the dis- tance. On both sides of the lower mouth of this bayou, are situated the richest part of the Rapide settlement. Few countries exhibit more beauty or greater indications of wealth. The plantations are in a high state of cultiva- tion, the soil rich, and the cotton raised here is of the best quality in the state. The sugar cane flourishes. The cotton and tobacco are very good, as are all kinds of vegetables. The orange and figtrees grow luxuriantly ; to complete these blessings, the climate is healthful and the inhabitants in a manner exempted from the diseases usually ineident to warm climates. This country furnishes immense quantities of lumber for the New Orleans and West India markets; and is capable of continuing the supply for ages. From the Rapide to the Indian villages is about twenty-four miles bend is fine, and suscepti ble of every kind of cultivation the whole distance. These villages are situated on both sides of the river in a very productive soil. A short distance above the Indian towns, the rich and populous settlement of Gilford's Station, commences. Six miles higher up is the Baluxa Indian village, where the river divides into two branches forming an island of fifty miles in length, and three or four in breadth, very fertile. The east stream is called Rigule de Bon Dieu ; on the left;"], [655, "633 STATE OF LOUISIANA. hand is the boat channel to Natchitoches. On this branch for forty miles, there are thick settlements, rich lands, and the inhabitants wealthy. This is called the river Cane settlement. A little above this settlement, the river divides iuto tliree channels, and forms the Brevel islands, the largest of which is thirty miles long and four wide. The central division is lined with settlements and is the boat channel ; the western channel, called Fausse Riviere, is navigable, but is uninhabited, owing to the lowness of the banks. This channel passes through lake L'Occasse, above which the three channels separate, where is situated the town of Natchitoches, and sort Claiborne, which stands on a hill elevated about thirty feet above the banks of the river. The land has here a handsome swelling surface, yielding a rich aud spontaneous pasturage to prodigious herds of cattle, and droves of horses, which give beauty and anima- tion to the prospect, aud croud the earth in every direc- tion. Cattle can be purchased for 27s. a head ; horses ffrom \u00a33 7s. Qd. to <\u00a3_ 10s. each. Swine run wild, and are raised with little or no expense, in immense numbers. The planters commence their cultivation about the first of March. During the growth of vegetation they have Sufficient rains to keep the earth moist, but in September and October, severe droughts are experienced. Although the dews are very heavy and powerful, yet the sun's rays lick up this moisture before it descends to the roots, and only gives it time to cool the withering stalk. The dews are known to fall so profusely, as to be seen running in little streams on the ground. From Natchitoches a road leads to the Sabine, Nacog- doches and San Antonio. The Bayou Bon Dieu enters the river about three miles above this town. Another bayou communicates with Bon Dieu and lake Noiz; above this lake the river continues in one channel, passing v through the tine settlement of Grand Ecorce, seven miles long; at the upper end of which comes into the river a bayou or decharge of Spanish lake. The river again divides a short distance above this lake; after which, the course of the west branch is westerly for nearly eighty miles, when it turns to the eastward and communicates with the right branch, forming au island 100 mites long:, and thirty wide. Boats cannot ascend by the west branch iu consequence of collections of driftwood, which choke up its curreut, in several places. The French settlement of Bayou Pierre extends nearly the whole length of this braach ; the land is of the best quality, and the inhabit-"], [656, "634 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. ants possess large herds of cattle, and are good livers. The face of this part of the country is agreeably hilly ; and the water very good. On the main or eastern branch, are several settlements. The laud on this branch is very rich ; but much cut up by bayous, lakes, and islands. The bottoms are several miles wide. The plantations reach up to the commencement of driftwood bridges. Bayou Channo, leading into lake Besteneau, affords a pretty good navigation ; and by passing through the lake and bayou Dacheet, boatmen gain several miles, as the meanders of the river are very tedious. The medium depth of this lake, is from fifteen to twenty feet, and never less than twelve, though the remains of cypress trees of all sizes, now dead, most of them with their tops broken off, are yet standing in the lake. From bayou Dacheet te the mountains, the river is free from obstructions. Eighty miles above Dacheet, is the Caddo Indian towns. The lands for this distance, are high, rich bottoms, widely ex tended from the river. Twenty miles below these towns, the river changes its direction, and turns to the west. The great rauge of pine forests that occupy the space^ from the prairies of Opelousas to the Red river, wind along the Sabine. The general surface of this region rises gradually from prairies into hills ; the principal range of which pursues nearly the same course as the Sabine, at the distance of twenty or twenty-five miles from the river, and divide the waters that flow into it from these that flow into the Red river and Calcasu. Along the creeks, through this tract of country, are found spots of productive soil. Pine and oak are the prevailing timber on such situations, and pasturage is abundant during the months of spring and summer ; but want of water during the dry seasons is the greatest defect of that district. The prairie Grand Chevreuil begins between the over flown lands of the Atchafalaya and the Teche rivers, on the west of the former, following the direction of the Teche, nearly north, sometimes north-west, terminates eight miles east of Opelousas. Most of the prairie is extremely rich, particularly on the borders of the Teche. The timber consists of several species of hickory, syca more, sweet gum, black oak, willow oak, American elm, magnolia, sassafras, &c. with some live oak. The soil is a rich, friable, black loam, from a foot to eighteen inches deep ; and though surrounded with swamps and lagoons the climate is mild and healthful. The country between the Mermentau and Atchafalaya, extending 115 miles along the gulf, and about ninety north,"], [657, "635 STATE OF LOUISIANA. is called the Attacapas. Within this there is a great prairie, bearing the same name. Considerable tracts are subject fo inundation, but many parts possess the highest degree of fertility. North and east of this lies the great Opelousas prairie, extending to the Sabine, and forming the south-west corner of the state. It has several large prairies, such as the Opelousas prairie ; on the north of that the Grand prairie ; the prairie Mamon ; prairie Cal- casu, and the Sabine prairie. The first of these contains upwards of 1,120,000 acres. Rich soil, and good timber are found along the southern and eastern parts of this district ; but the rest is wild and the most of it barren, occupied only by great herds of cattle and buffalo. There is no extent of land on the globe, possessing greater diversity of soil than the state of Louisiana. The southern part is mostly included in the delta* of the Mississippi : it is flat, and where the surface can be pre- served from inundation, extremely fertile ; the south- western part is generally level prairie, and very productive; the north-western portion, a thick forest, and low alluvial soil, upon the rivers ; but at a distance from the streams, the land is high, broken, and sterile. This alluvial soil of Louisiana, independent of its intrinsic fertility, finds in the annual floods a perpetual renewal of its strength, from the fertilizing slime and mud deposited by the overflowing current of the rivers, particularly of the Mississippi. The lands on the banks of this mighty stream, that have been under cultivation sixty or seventy years, without manure, are equally productive as when first planted. The country west of the delta of the Mississippi, offers an infinity of interesting views to the traveller and the emigrant. Only a few years have elapsed since this region was opened to the inspection of civilized man. The immense length of Red and Arkansaw rivers, the fertility and variety of the lands from which their streams are derived, and the ex traordinary features and productions of the great natural meadows of Louisiana, have at length arrested the atten tion of mankind ; and will, no doubt, in a few revolving years, exhibit, upon a vast surface, cultivated society, where, from countless ages, the wild beasts of the forests * As this term frequently occurs in this and other works treating of Louisiana, it may not be improper to give its explanation : \u2014 The estuary of the Nile, in Egypt, was called by the ancients, delta, from its resemblance to the Greek letter A ot' that name. This was tolerably appropriate when applied to the Nile ; but could not apply to other rivers, whose mouths formed lands of very different outlines. It is now used to denote the alluvial tracts of land formed by the waters of any river, whose streams carry down and deposit great bodies of sediment on their banks, and near their mouths. 4 M"], [658, "636 ONITKD STATES OF AMERICA. were pursued by tbe prowling savage. It is highly gratify ing to behold the emulation of industry and peace, to see new towns, farms, and manufactories, rising where .silence and desolation reigned twenty years since, and where only six years have elapsed since that silence was broken by the din of arms, and where cruel massacre stained the earth with the blood of the most innocent aud helpless of the human race. The great staple productions of this state are cotton, sugar, rice, and Indian corn. Tobacco and indigo could be as extensively cultivated as cotton; but neither ofthe former offers such alluring prospects to the planter as the latter. To new settlers, and to persons of moderate pro perty, cotton presents a more easy source of revenue; even in places where the soil and climate will admit the culture of sugar. The best districts for cotton in the state of Louisiana, are the banks of Red river, Ouachitta, bayou Boeuf, the river Teche, and the Mississippi. Cotton land yields from 500 to 2,000 lbs. of seed cotton an t_cre; and one man will cultivate ten acres. The profits of a good slave may be reckoned at 240 dollars per annum. But though cotton stuceeds best on the deep alluvial of the rivers, it is extremely profitable on the prairie land, dis tant from any considerable streams of water. On second rate land, which occurs on the small water-courses iu the pine tracts, there are considerable bodies of land very favourable to cotton. This latter species of soil occurs extensively between the Red aud Sabine, and between the Red and Ouachitta rivers; much of it is yet the pro perty of the United States; though in December, 1818, and in February, 1819, there were very extensive sales of public land in Louisiana, each of which continued for three weeks. Late experiments have proved that the sugar cane can be successfully cultivated in any part of the state, except in the swampy or unripe alluvial soils. Sugar lands yield from one to two hogsheads of 1,000 lbs. weight each, and fifty gallons of ram an acre ; the value is; about 100 dol lars a hogshead. In one season twenty-eight men have been known to make 200 hogsheads of sugar ; and an old man, assisted by his two sons, carried thirty hogsheads te market, the produce of their own hands, in one season. The planters, in order to guard against the effect of an early frost, regularly finish, iibout the 15th of October, pulling up the canes intended for next year's planting. This is done by putting them into stacks, with all their leaves on, in such a manner as to expose the smallest"], [659, "637 STATE OF LOUISIANA. pos.sible quantity of the stalk to the weather. Early in the spring, those canes are laid along in plough furrows, the large end of one cane nearly touching the small end next to it, and the furrows distant from each other about three feet. The plant is cultivated in the same manner as Indian corn, and with equal ease. The cutting and grindiug are commenced whenever the seed canes are put up, and continue frequently till the latter end of Decem ber ; and long after the canes have been killed by the frost. A mill that can grind 300 gallons an hour, and deliver opwards of two tons of sugar daily, costs in workmanship and materials 1,000 dollars; besides the expense of a rough cover for ii, forty feet square. The cost of three pestles, of sufficient size to keep pace with the mill, is 350 dol lars, and that of the mason work in bedding them and makin? the furnaces, is 250 dollars ; which with the price of 30,000 bricks, a proportionate quantity of mortar, a rough building to cover the boilers, and six draft beasts to impel the machine, constitute the whole expenses of an establishment sufficient for the manufacture of 200 ho-rsheads of sugar. On the banks of the Mississippi, below the efflux of Placquemine, 117 miles above New Orleans, on the river Lafourche, in all its extent ; on the Teche, below the entrance of the bayou Fusilier ; and on the Vermilion river, below N. lat. 30\u00b0 12' ; wherever the soil is elevated above the annual inundation, sugar can be produced. On all these places, except the Vermilion, sugar farms and houses are at this time established to great advantage. Rice can be cultivated in anyT part ofthe state of Louisi ana, where the soil will permit its growth ; as water is easily diverted from the rivers and bayous into the fields ; the use of which on rice is more to suppress the growth of noxious weeds and grass, which would otherwise stifle the grain, than for promoting the growth of the rice itself; for none of the grasses can stand the water, but rice does, as long as it is not totally immersed. Therefore it is, that after weeding, the planter lets on water to about half the height of the grain. The summers are of sufficient length below the 33\u00b0 of N. lat. to enable this grain to ripen. Rice is now the third in quantity and value of the staples of the states though its culture is more parti cularly confined to the banks of the Mississippi, where watering the ground ean be moro easily performed than in any other part of the country. This staple could be multiplied to any extent, that the demands of domestic"], [660, "638 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. consumption or foreign commerce should make necessary. There is an immense range of country between the Sabine and Pearl rivers, more congenial to tbe culture of rice than any other vegetable. Indian corn is, perhaps, of more real importance to the planter, on and near the banks ofthe Mississippi, than any other production. This invaluable plant may be called, with strict propriety, the nurse of the human species in the newly established settlements of America. It is every where sound, on all soils and climates, from Canada to the gulf of Mexico ; and is, wherever produced, the principal article of food for man and his most valuable domestic animals. There is no crop which differs so much in quan tity in different seasons, and in different soils, as Indian corn : from five to 110 bushels have been produced from an acre in one year. The state of Louisiana is not the most favourable part of the United States for the culture of this plant ; but excellent crops are produced. The ground most congenial to its growth does not differ much from that suitable to cotton. The time of planting Indian corn below 33\u00b0 N. lat. to the gulf of Mexico, may be chosen from the beginning of April to the 10th of June. It is not unusual to see ripe corn in one field, and in the adjoining enclosure the young plant just making its ap pearance above the ground. Wheat and rye might be raised in this state, but from the facility with which flour and whisky can be imported down the Mississippi, it is not very probable that the cul ture of either wheat or rye will ever be much attended to, where more lucrative articles can be produced. The fruits most generally cultivated are, the peach, and orange, the perpetual verdure of the latter, intermixed with fig trees, surrounding the houses, and planted in groves and orchards near them, highly beautify the pros pect ; while the grateful fragrance of constant blossoms, and the successive progress to plentiful ripened fruit, charm the eye, and regale the senses of the admiring observer. The apple is often seen, but does not thrive well : the climate is perhaps too warm in summer. Plums, grapes, and pomegranates grow luxuriantly, and produce abundantly, but are much neglected. The gardens in general are not equal to what they might be, from the fertility of the soil, and the mildness of the seasons. There is no country, however, that wonld admit of finer gardens, or a greater variety of plants, either for use or ornament; but the attention paid to the culture of the rich staples, engrosses too much time and industry, to leave"], [661, "639 STATE OF LOUISIANA. leisure for the more elegant, but less lucrative branches of agriculture. Table of profits resulting from (he employment of fifty workmen on a farm in Louisiana. The whole extent of the state of Louisiana, after deduct ing one-fifth for the swamps, rivers, lakes, pine barrens, aud other irreclaimable tracts, extends over upwards of 24,000,000 acres. The one-tenth of that quantity may be assumed for cotton. Indigo, which demands a richer soil, but similar climate, is allowed another tenth. Tobacco oan be raised in all parts of the state, but the soil best suited for it is nearly the same as that required for sugar cane. The seasons in Louisiana are extremely variable ; the difference between two succeeding winters at New Orleans, is frequently as much as could be expected in a change of four or five degrees of latitude. The orange tree and sugar cane are often destroyed by frost, even upon the shores of the gulf of Mexico ; though in ordinary seasons, the ponds and other stagnant waters, as low as 30\u00b0 N. lat., are seldom frozen. There is much more difference in climate between Natchez and New Orleans, than could be expected from the relative position of each. Snow is frequent at the former place, and often falls in consider able quantity ; and from the frosts in spring, the peaches are sometimes greatly injured : it is even common for the cotton to be killed late in April. Those unseasonable storms, that occur in every part of the United States, are frequent and destructive along the gulf of Mexico. At the town of Opelousas, which stands in 30\u00b0 32' N. lat., 220 miles north-west of New Orleans, in the month January, 1807, a considerable quantity of snow fell, and remained on the ground upwards of a week. At the same place, in the month of Jan. 1812, snow fell nearly a foot deep ; and in April, 1814, the young peaches, Staple. Amount. Price. Annual re- venue from each hand.

Any person coining from the northern states to visit auy part of Louisiana or Mississippi, b.iow 33\u00b0 r. tt.. would find it for his benefit to go to New Orleais or Mobile by sea, and to arrive in tho^e cities as late as November. There is uo impediment, arising from winter. in visiting any part of the country; heavy raius seldom fall before January, and often not so early in the seasop. The whole of these states cau be examined with safety and comfort, il tiring November, December, January, February, and March ; the sickly season does not commence beloro August: June is the most healthy, and September the most sickly months. The ordinary expenses of travelling do not greatly vary in different parts of the United States, in a given distance ; but there isa great and essential difference in time. Where good ferries, stages, and, above all, steam-boats, are established, the rate at which a traveller can advance is much accelerated ; but his expenses are in proportion to the conveniences with which he is provided ; and though he can proceed with more celerity, he canuot pass from place to place with much, if any less money, than by the good old fashion of riding a good horse. Except by water there is no public conveyance yet established in the Missis sippi or Mobile countries, for the convenience of travel lers ; they are obliged to provide themselves the means of transportation. Horses, of all prices, are constantly to be procured iu New Orleans and Natchez ; a medium prieg. may be about eighty dollars. Civil divisions, towns, population, &c. \u2014 This state is: divided into three great natural sections, viz. thte north west \u2014 Red river, and Washita sections ; containing 21 ,649 square miles, and 12,700 inhabitants.

Twenty-six. 86,556 New Orleans, the capital of the state of Louisiana, is situated directly on the east bank of the Mississippi, 105 miles from the mouth of the river. In the year 1717, this city was founded : and at tbat period there were not per- haps 500 white inhabitants in the whole valley of the Mississippi : there are now nearly two millions. In the beginning of 1788, the town contained 1,100 houses, built of wood ; in March of that year, by a fire, the number of houses was reduced in five hours to 200. It has since been rebuilt, principally of brick, which is of so soft a nature, that tbe buildings are plastered on the outside with a thick coat of mortar, and then painted or whitewashed. The city is regularly laid out, and the"], [664, "642 CNITED STATES OF AMERICA. streets generally forty feet wide, crossing each other at right angles. In 1803, the number of inhabitants was about 9,000; at the commencement of 1819, the popula tion amounted to between 36 and 40,000, and it is rapidly increasing by accessions from all the states in the Union, and from almost every kingdom in Europe. A great num ber of new buildings were erected in the last two years, distinguished for size and improved style of the architec ture. The hurricanes to which this country is subject, will not admit of the houses being carried up several stories; but they have terraces and walks on their tops according to the French fashion. The public buildings consist of three banking houses, two handsome churches, custom-house, town-house, market-house, arsenal, con vent, jail, theatre, and governor's palace, built by the Spanish government. The Place des armes is a beauti ful green, which serves as a parade. Most of the houses in the suburbs have fine gardens, ornamented with orange groves. The general style of living is luxurious, and the private dwellings are elegantly furnished. The markets are plentifully supplied with the neces saries of life, and the luxuries of every country ; but pro visions are excessively dear. Hams and cheese from England, and potatoes, butter, and beef from Ireland, are common articles of import. Cabbages sell from Qd. to lOd. a head, and turkeys from three to five dollars each ; all other articles of food in proportion ; rents are also bigher than in any other part of the United States. There are five newspapers printed in this city, three in the English language, and two in French and English : indeed the French tongue is spoken by more than half of the inhabitants. It is upon the levee fronting the city that the universe is to be seen in miniature ; it is crowded with vessels from every part of the world, and with boats from a thousand different places in the upper country. In one year 594 flat-bottomed boats, and 300 barges, arrived from the western states and territories, with the following articles of produce, viz. apples, 4,253 barrels ; bacon and hams, 13,000 cwt. ; bagging, 2,579 pieces; beef, 2,459 barrels; beer, 439 do. ; butter, 509 do. ; bear skins, 2,000 ; candles, 358 boxes ; cheese, 30 cwt. ; cider, 646 barrels ; cordage, 400 cwt. ; cordage bailing, 4,798 coils ; Indian corn, 13,775 bushels; do. meal, 1,075 barrels; cotton, 37,371 bales; flaxseedoil,85 barrels ; flour, 97,419 do. ;genseng, 957 do.; hay, 356 bundles ; hemp yarns, 1,095 reels; hides, 5,000; hogs, 500 ; horses, 375 ; lead, 5,500 cwt. ; white do., 188"], [665, "643 STATE OF LOUISIANA. barrels ; linens (coarse*) 2.500 pieces ; lard, 2,458 barrels ; oats, 4,065 bushels ; paper, 750 reams ; peltries, 2,450 packs ; pork, 9,725 barrels ; potatoes, 3,750 bushels; gun powder, 294 barrels; saltpetre, 175 cwt.; soap, 1,538 boxes ; tallow, 160 cwt. ; tobacco, 7,282 hhds. ; do. manu factured, 711 barrels; whisky, 320,000 gallons. Besides a great quantity of horned cattle, iron castings, grind stones, indigo, muskets, pacan nuts, peas, beans, &c. &c. The schedule of the above produce is independent of what is furnished by the state of Louisiana, consisting of cotton, corn, indigo, molasses, masts and spars, planks, rice, sugar, shingles, soap, taffia, tallow, timber, bees wax, &c. which are generally brought to market in plant ers' crafts, or taken from off the plantations by foreign bound vessels. The city of New Orleans will at no very distant period, become to the United States, what Alexandria formerly was to Egypt, the great emporium of its commerce, its wealth, and its political greatness, in relation to the rest ofthe World ; but it will also become the hot-bed of con tagion, luxury, effeminacy, crime, treachery, and civil dis cord. The more we contemplate the present and pro spective resources of New Orleans, the more must we be convinced of its future greatness ; being built in the form of a crescent, the curve of the river constitutes a safe and commodious harbour, in which there were in May, 1818, 250 sail of vessels ; it is defended on one side by the river, aud on the other by a swamp that no human power can drain, and uo effort can penetrate, the city can only be approached through a defile three quarters of a mile wide, which being protected by a breast-work, manned by 5,000 men, (for a greater number could not act) New Orleans, in point of strength, is another Gibraltar, and bids defiance to the most powerful and best disciplined invaders. In the year 1818, the citizens of the states of Missis sippi and Louisiana vended at this port cotton and sugar to the amount of 2,000,000 of dollars, the fruit of their industry the preceding year ; besides vast quantities of rice, indigo, &c. It is not uncommon for a planter in either of those states to receive an annual income of 30,000 dollars from his farm ; there are instances of some whose income amounts to 80,000, and a few to 120,000 dollars. The humbler labourer, whose all consists in eight or ten mules, has been kuovvn to make 100 dollars a day, during the winter of 1817, by dragging cotton from the river to the warehouses, usually about 200 yards', 4x"], [666, "644 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. for which he is paid the extraordinary sum of one dollar per bale. The aggregate increase of the commerce of this port during the year 1818, was more than one-fifth. Where the earth is thus bountiful, where industry is thus rewarded, what human foresight can fix bounds to the prosperity of the country? Though already a rallying point for the luxuries of the world and the theatre of enterprize for people of aU tongues and nations ; and though the ships of every nation are proudly pressing forward, in competition for her commerce, New Orleans is but the mere germ of what she must oue day inevitably become. \u2014 Distance from the city of Washington 144. miles; from Pittsburgh 2,188; from St. Louis 1,179; and from the city of Mexico (by land) 1,549 miles. Lat. 29\u00b0 57' N. long. 12\u00b0 53' W. The other towns of this state \"being little more than mere villages, are entitled to no further notice than what arises from the admirably chosen situations of some of them, which promise at a future day to become places of great wealth and importance. Natchitoches stands upon the west bank of Red river, in N. lat. 31\u00b0 46' W. long. 16\u00b0 7' ; 170 miles from Natchez; and 356 from New Orleans. This town, or rather mili _ tary post, was established in January, 1717. The first buildings were erected about a mile to the south of the present village ; the remains of the old fort and of ths gardens still remain visible. Natchitoches now is, and must continue, a place of considerable consequence. Before the revolution commenced in Texas, in 1811, an extensive inland trade was carried on through this town, between the people of Louisiana and those ofthe Spanish internal provinces ; this traffic will be at a future day re vived. A few troops are stationed here, which, with the Indian trade, still gives a lively business to this place. This is the largest town in Louisiana, west of the Missis sippi; and, it should not be forgotten, lies on the direct road from New Orleans to Mexieo. Madisonville is handsomely situated on the west bank of the Chefuncti, two mites above its entrance into lake Pontchartrain, and about twenty-six south-east of New Orleans. It lies more convenient for the necessary sup plies and materials for repairing and building vessels ; and such are the local advantages of this place, that government have fixed on the site ofa navy yard near the mouth of the Chefuncti, where a frigate is now building, intended for the defence of the lakes. This is a more healthful place, and less infected with musketoes than"], [667, "645 STATE OF LOUISIANA. New Orleans. The country above Madisonvilte is pecu liarly adapted to the rearing of hogs and cattle; for they neither require salt, nor attention in winter; and no where in the United States are they raised in greater num bers, than in the district under review. Alexandria has been already noticed ; it is only neces- sary farther to observe, that it stands at the head of barge navigation, in N. lat. 3P 19' W. long. 15\u00b0 28', and is sixty-three mites from Natchitoches, and 344 from New Orleans. The settlements round this town are flourishing and wealthy ; and it is generally supposed that Rapides has more valuable land in proportion to its extent, than any other parish in the state. The inhabitants of Louisiana are chiefly descendants ofthe French and Canadians; though there are a con- siderable number of English and Americans iu New Orleans. The two German coasts are peopled by the descendants of settlers from Germany, and a few French mixed with them. The three succeeding settlements up to Baton Rouge, contain mostly the descendants of people from Nova Scotia, banished from that country by the English. The district of Baton Rouge, especially the east side, is composed partly of Nova Scotians, a very sew French, and a great majority of Americans; on the west side they are mostly from Nova Scotia ; as they are at Point Coupee and Fausee river, with many French mixed among them. Of the population of the Atacapas and Opelousas, a considerable part is American ; Natchit- oches contains but a few Americans, and the remainder of the inhabitants are French ; but the former are more nume- rous in the other settlements on that river ; vjz. Avoyelles, Rapides, and Ouacheta. At Arkansas they are mostly French, and at New Madrid Americans. At least two fifths, if not a greater proportion, of all the settlers on the former Spanish side of the Mississippi, in the state of Illinois, are likewise supposed to be Americans. Below New Orleans, the population is altogether Freneh, and the descendants of Frenchmen. Many of the people of this state, particularly in the southern parts, are gay and lively; their manners pretty much the same as the French. They have a turn for mechanics and tiie fine arts ; but their system of education has been long so badly attended to, that but little real science has been yet obtained. The citizens of Louisiana, by the fulfilment of the severest duty mankind can per form, have shown themselves worthy of all the protec tion and encouragement that the nation can give. In the<"], [668, "646 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. hour of alarm the Louisianianswere at the station of duty, and, in the day of battle, stood firm at the post of honour. Their gallantry aided in giving the United States a name, that time may render venerable, but can never destroy. Except domestic manufactures, which do not appear to be carried on to a great extent, there are no material establishments of that kind iu this country; and in all probability the trade of Louisiana will continue for a long time to be an object of solicitude to the manufacturing districts, particularly Pittsburgh, and Lexington, in Ken tucky. On the other hand, from the increase of cotton and sugar, a great trade will always be supported between New Orleans and the cities on the Atlantic. The exports of this state, even at this early period, exceed those of all the New England states by more than 150,000 dollars a year. Nearly 400 sea vessels arrive and depart annually; and in the last year, 937 vessels of all denominations cleared out from the bayou St. John alone, the tonnage of which amounted to 16,000 tons: these were chiefly employed in carrying the produce of that part of the Floridas annexed to Louisiana ; consisting of barks, coals, cotton, corn, furs, hides, pitch, planks, rosin, skins, tar, timber, turpeutine, sand, shells, lime, &c. The direct ex ports of 1810, amounted to 1,897,522 dollars; in 1817, they had increased to 9,024,812 dollars, of which 8,241,254 were domestic produce. The government of this state is nearly the same as that of Mississippi ; and, in like manner, to accommodate the original settlers, who had slaves, slavery is continued on the same principle as in the southern states. The constitu tion guarantees religious and political freedom. Every citizen of the United States, who has resided in the coun try one year, and paid a state tax, or purchased public land, has a right to vote at the election of representatives for that bounty. The state sends two senators and one representative to the general cougresss. History of Louisiana as it existed under France and Spain. \u2014 The country of Louisiana was first discovered by Sabastian Cabot in 1497, and was visited fifteen years afterwards by De Leon, a Spaniard, who failed in endea vouring to establish a colony. Colonel Wood, who landed herein 1654, and captain Bolt, in 1670, appear to have done nothing more than examine a small portion of terri tory. The next person who attempted to form a settle ment in this country was M., de la Salle^ who, having"], [669, "647 STATE OF LOUISIANA. traversed the Mississippi in 1682, sailed from Frano#.in 1685, with four small vessels and 170 men, with an inten tion of landing at the mouth of that river. By untoward circumstances they were obliged to land in the bay of St. Bernard's, about 300 miles to the westward of their destination ; where, after struggling with many hardships, some of the adventurers murdered La Salle, and all the rest perished, except seven persons, who penetrated through the country to Canada. In 1699, captain Iberville of the navy, a Canadian by birth, sailed from Rochfort with two ships and a number of men, and laid the foundation of tbe first French colony on the Mississippi, and named the country Louisiana. Iu J712, this colony was diminished, by some unfavourable circumstances, to no more than twenty-eight families. At this time, Crozart, a merchant of great opulence, obtained the exclusive trade of Louisiana ; but his plans, which were extensive and patriotic, proving abortive, he resigned his charter, in 1717, to the famous projector, John Law, author of the well-known Mississippi scheme, that proved the ruin of thousands. From this period the country become an interesting object to speculative adventurers; so that in 1718 and the following year, a numerous colony of labourers, col lected from France, Germany and Switzerland, was con veyed to Louisiana, and settled in a district called Biloxi, near New Orleans, a barren and unhealthy situation, where many hundreds died through want and vexation. In 1720, the Spaniards of New Mexico, jealous of their active neighbours, formed a scheme for establishing a large colony on the Missouri, with a view to overawe the French colonists. Accordingly, numerous caravans, who were to constitute this colony, proceeded from Santa Fe, and directed their march towards the country ofthe Osage Indians, hoping to engage this nation (the mortal enemies of the Missouris) to assist them in conquering the country of the latter, which they resolved to occupy. The Spani ards missed their way, and went directly to the nation whose ruin they meditated ; and ignorant of their mistake, communicated their design without reserve. The Missouri chief, who, by this singular mistake, became acquainted with the dauger which threatened him and his people, concealed his feelings, and informed the Spaniards that he would readily assist in accomplishing their plan, and requested forty-eight hours to assemble his warriors. In the mean time, the unsuspecting Spaniards were amused with sports, till 2,000 warriors had assemhled with their"], [670, "648 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. arms, when they fell upon the Spaniards while asleep, and slew every soul, except the chaplain, who owed his preservation to the singularity of his dress. The disastrous failure of the settlement at Biloxi, ruined the reputation of the whole country : and, the colony hav ing languished till the year 1731, tbe company at length purchased the favour of surrendering their toncer.is into the hands of government, for which they paid the sum of 1,450,000 livres. The French remained in quiet possession of Louisiana, frequent contests with the Indians excepted, till tbe year 1762. The Natchez and Chickasaws we-e the principal tribes engaged in this long proctracted warfare, which at length terminated in permanent peace. From this time the prospects of the colonists began to brighten, as their peltry-trade with the Indians, and their commerce with the West Indies, were increasing. Several hundred Cana dians, together with many inhabitants from other coun tries, settled on the banks of the Mississippi, and impart ed additional strength and prosperity to the original colony. Such was the state of the country when in the year 1764 the inhabitants received information, that Louisiana had been ceded to Spain by a secret treaty. This mea sure incensed the colonists to such a degree, that the Spaniards were vigorously opposed ; nor did they obtain complete possession ofthe country until August 1769; after which event, many persons of rank and talents were put to death, to atone for the delay of submission, and others were conveyed away to languish out their lives in the dungeons of the Havannah. By the treaty of peace in 1763, which ceded Canada to Great Britain, the boundaries of the British provinces were extended southward to the gulf of Mexico, and westward to the river Mississippi ; and Louisiana was limited north by Caneda, and east by the Mississippi, exceptiug that it included what is called the island of New Orleans on its east bank. This state of things remained till the American revolutionary war, during which Spain took from Great Britain the two Floridas. At the cota clusion of that war, the United States became an inde pendent government, leaving nothing to Britain of all her American provinces, but such as lie north and east of the said states. All these changes were sanctioned and confirmed by the treaty of peace concluded in 1783. In this state things continued till the treaty of Ildefonso, in October, 1800, by which Spain engaged to cede to the"], [671, "STATE OF ALABAMA. 649 French republic, on certain conditions, the colony or pro vince of Louisiana, with the same extent which it actually had when France formerly possessed it. This treaty was confirmed and enforced by the treaty of Madrid, dated March 1801. From France it passed to the United States., by the treaty of April, 1803, as alreauy stated. STATE OF ALABAMA. Situation, Boundaries, and Extent. THIS state, which now closes the column of republics from the Canadian lakes to the gulf of Mexico, and from the Atlantic ocean to the Sabine river, lately formed part ofthe Mississippi territory; but in March, 1817, was detached from the western part, by an act of congress, as exhibited on the map prefixed to this work. It is increasing rapidly in population and wealth, and the pro bability is, that the section of Florida, lying to the west of Chatahouchy river, will be annexed to it, as soon as that country becomes a part of the United States. Alabama is situated between 30' 10' and 35\u00b0 N. lat. and S\u00b0 and 11\u00b030'W. long.; and is bounded on the north by the state of Tennessee; south, by the gulf of. Mexico and West Florida ; ea.-t, by Georgia ; and west, by the state of Mississippi. From north to south it is 317 miles in length ; and from east to west 174 miles in breadth ; forming an area of about 46,000 square miles, or 29,440,000 acres. Rivers. \u2014 The main rivers of this state run south, and fall into the gulf of Mexico : the Alabama is the most considerable. Several o'f the navigable streams enter the gulf through Florida; which circumstance shows of how much importance it is to flie safety and prosperity of the United States to have possession of the Florid as, West Florida, as far east as Perdido river, was ceded to the American government along with Louisiana, and, judging from recent transactions, we may conclude that they will soon be in possession of the whole, which will be produc tive of a lasting benefit, both to the inhabitants of Florida and the United States."], [672, "650 CNITED STATES OF AMERICA. The river Alabama rises in the Cherokee country, near the boundary line between the states of Georgia and Ten* nessee, and proceeding in a south-west direction, unites with the Tombigbee nine miles above the 31st degree of N. lat., and forms with it the river Mobile. The junc tion of the two rivers is about forty-five miles from the head of Mobile bay, and the river is navigable thus far, and indeed several miles further, for any vessel which can come up the bay. From this place to fort Claiborne, about sixty miles, vessels can be navigated that do not draw more than six feet water ; from thence to the mouth of the Cahaba, is estimated at 150 miles, and for this dis tance the river affords four or five feet depth of water. From the Cahaba to the forks of the Coosa and Talla poosa, the two main branches of the Alabama, is said to be 160 miles, and the navigation is still good, except at two ripples, in which, however, there is water sufficient for the passage of boats. Tbe Tallapoosa rises in the high lands near the Cherokee possessions, and runs in a westwardly direction through the territory belonging to the Creeks. It is full of rocks, falls, and shoals, until it reaches near to Tookabache, about thirty-five miles above fort Jackson ; which is situ ated in a point of land between the Coosa and Tallapoosa, eight miles above their junction : from thence to its mouth it is navigable, except in very dry seasons. Coosa river has its source in the Cherokee country, and runs southerly through the district occupied by the Upper Creeks. It is rapid, and in general full of rocks ; but has a fine deep channel from its mouth to the great shoals, five miles above fort Jackson : here, in the present state of things, may be reckoned the head of navigation on this river. There is a continuation of rocky shoals to fort Williams, a distance of fifty miles; which is much to be regretted, as the navigation is not materially obstructed above, and can be pursued up the Coosa to one of its head streams, called the Connesangah, which is about fifteen yards wide, from the boatable part of which to the boatable part of the Amoy is but eight or ten miles over a firm level country. The Amoy is about sixty feet broad, and is a branch of the Hiwassee, which discharges itself into the Tennessee river, about eight miles below Knox ville. The distance from sort Williams to fort Strother is nearly sixty miles by laud, but considerably more by water. From thence to the portage, or big-hest point of navigation on the Connesangah, it is probably 120 or 130 miles by land."], [673, "651 STATE OF ALABAMA. As to the time it takes to navigate the Alabama, it may be stated, that to go from Mobile to fort Jackson, distant about 220 miles, it will take from a month to six weeks, according to the state of the river. A barge with five hands, and carrying 125 barrels, has gone from Mobile to fort Jackson in thirty days: but it was reckoned a re markable good trip : the business, however, is new, and experience will probably lead to expedition. Tombigbee river is a continuation of the Mobile, above its junction with the Alabama, and has its name from sort Tombigbee, which stands about ninety-six miles above the town of Mobile. The source of this stream is reckon ed to be 120 miles higher up, in the country ofthe Chick asaws: it is navigable for .sloops and schooners about 105 miles above Mobile town. The Black Warrior, a fine stream from the east, enters the Tombigbee 160 miles above Mobile, and is the largest of its tributary rivers, except the Alabama. It holds ont to adventurers very superior advantages; because it is destined to become the channel of communication be tween the immense fertile country on both sides of the Tenuessee river, and the several seaports which will, at no remote period, embellish the bays of Mobile and Perdido. The fact appears clearly established, that goods ean be brought from Europe, New York, or even New Orleans, to Huntsville, by way of Mobile, Tombigbee, and Black Warrior rivers, in about half the time, and for less risk and expense, than by any other route hitherto used or known. From Mobile to the falls of the Black Warrior, is about 500 miles by the winding of the rivers ; boats that do not draw more than three feet of water ean ascend it thus far at all seasons: the portage from the falls to the Tennessee river is about forty miles, and to Hunts ville eighty miles further. European goods can reach the Tennessee, from Mobile, in thirty days, when it would require 100 days by ascending the Mississippi. The Chatahouchy, (noticed in page 499) is a noble river, affording a navigation of 400 miles. From its source in Georgia it pursues a south-west course, until it strikes the boundary line between Georgia and Alabama ; when itself becomesthe division line to the limits of West Florida, a distauce of 120 miles. The country between the Chatahouchy and Mobile rivers is about 180 miles wide ; it is watered be the Per dido, which forms the boundary between the state of Alabama and the remnant of West Florida, and falls into Perdido bay. The other streams are the Conecuh an4 NO. xxvm, 4 o"], [674, "652 UN1TED STATES OF AMERICA. Escambia, whose waters unite and flow into Pensacola bay; the Conecuh is navigable upwards of 100 miles, and is lined by forests of valuable timber. Beyond the Escam bia is Yellow-water river, which falls into the bay of Pen sacola. Choetaw and Pea rivers, still further east, fall into the bay of St. Roses. These streams are all naviga ble from fifty to 100 miles ; the country which they drain is mostly ofa sandy soil, aud the timber chiefly pine. Face of the country, soil, productions, &c\u2014 The state of Alabama possesses a very great diversity of soil, climate, and natural, vegetable, and mineral productions. Occupy ing the valley of the Mobile and its tributary streams, together with a fine body of land upon both banks of the Tennessee river, its position in au agricultural and commercial point of view is extremely advantageous. Having the finest river, to its length, in all North America, and an extensive surface of excellent soil, Alabama pre sents a most desirable field for youthful enterprise. The northern parts of this state are broken, and near the Tennessee boundary line, towards the north-east cor ner, it may be said to be mountainous. The middle is hilly, with here aud there tracts of level prairie land. Along the Florida line is a strip of country fifty or sixty miles wide, covered with short and long-leaved pine, cypress, &c. The soil between the Mobile and the Chata houchy, bordering West Florida, is better than that on the east side of Flint river ; between the Conecuh and the Chatahouchy the land is broken and waving; the ridge dividing their waters has high flats of light sandy land, well set with hickory, and iron ore has been found in places. All the streams have cane on their margins, and are frequently ornamented with the sour orange tree; the country is healthy, and affords a fine range for cattle, hogs, and horses. The pine flats have the wire-grass; the soil of the waving land, stiff red loam, with stone on the ridges: the pine land is pretty good for Indian corn. Between the Mobile and Perdido, the soil is thin, the timber, pine, cypress, &c. The head waters of Escambia and Conecuh embrace large quantities of fine cotton and sugar lands, ornamented with orange groves. Upon the Tensaw, are pine and cypress forests, of a heavy growth ; canebrakes along the river, and sometimes cypress swamps. The Alabama is margined with cane swamps ; these, at intervals, with pine flats of good soil, suitable for sugar, cotton, and corn. The swamps at its"], [675, "653 STATE OF ALABAMA. Oonfluence with the Tombigbee, and for some distance below, are subject to periodical inundations, for which reason the inhabitants never fence their improvements. Above they are very wide, intersected with slashes and crooked drains, and much infested with musketoes. The land bordering on the swamps is a poor stiff clay, for one mile back ; tbe growth pine and underbrush ; back of this, broken pine barren ; cypress ponds and canebrakes ou the brauches. Fifty mites from the union of the Alabama with Tombigbee, the high broken lands com* mence, extending for sixty miles upwards ; timber, oak, hicKory, poplar, and very large cedars. The best part of the state is to be found between the Alabama and Tombigbee ; the Black Warrior, and Bear creek, have some fine bottoms ; and those of the Talla- poosa from Tookabatchee to its confluence with theCoosa, about thirty miles, are excellent ; the broken land termi- nates on its right bank, the good land spreads out on the left. Proceeding towards the dividing ridge between the Alabama waters and those of the Conecuh, we pass over an extensive tract of rich land, the timber large, and cane abundant, liberally watered by creeks ; this tract is thirty miles long including the plains, and twenty wide. The plains are waving, hill and dale, and appear divided into fields, interspersed or bounded with clumps of woodland; soil, lead-coloured or dark clay, very rich, and covered with weeds and tall grass. Below the plains, soil stiff, very red in places, and gravelly ; surface broken for thirty miles, then pine barren. At the sources of Limestone ereek, there is an excellent body of land called the Dog- wood ; the growth of which is oak, chesnut, poplar, pine, and dogwood. This vein of land is twenty miles in length, and eight broad; the dogwood is very thick set and tall, the whole finely watered. Sixty miles above the conflu- ence of Coosa and Tallapoosa, there is a high waving country, settled by the Creek Indians, who live generally on rich flats of oak, hickory, poplar, walnut, and mul berry. The springs are fine ; cane grows on the creeks, and reed on the branches ; the surrounding country broken and gravelly. Most kinds of game are scarce through out the state. Stone coal abounds on the Cahaba, Black Warrior, &c. The country lying between Coosa, Tallapoosa, and Cha tahouchy, above their falls, is broken ; the soil stiff, with coarse gravel, and in some places stone. The trees, post oak, white and black oak, pine, hickory, and chesnut ; all as them small ; the whole well watered, and the rivers*"], [676, "654 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. and creeks have rocky beds, clad in many places with moss, greatly relished by cattle, horses, and deer, and are margined with cane and reeds, aud .narrow strips or coves of rich flats. On the Coosa, sixty miles above its junction with Tallapoosa, there is limestone, and it is to be found in several places from thence to E-tow-woh and its west ern branches. The tract of country bounded on the north and west by the Alabama river, on the east by the boundary line, and on the south by the ridge, is probably the largest body osgood land to be fonnd any wiiere within the limits of the treaty, south of Tennessee river. It comprehends au area of sixty townships, or about 2,000 square miles, a considerable portion of which is ofthe first quality, and there is but little of it that will fall below the rank of good second quality. About one half of the townships now offered for sate lies in this district. The river cane bottom land, is equal in fertility to any on the continent, and may average in width a half, or three quarters of a mile, the river winding through it in a serpentine course, and leaving the cane land sometimes on one side and sometimes on the other. The outside of the swamp joining the high land, as on most rivers, is low, wet, and cut up with ponds and lagoons. Next to the river swamp, and elevated above it by a bluff of from ten to fifteen feet in height, we enter upon an extensive body of level rich land, of fine black, or chocolate-coloured soil. The principal growth is hickory : black oak, post oak, dogwood, and poplar, are also common, but pine timber is rather scarce. This portion of land is inter spersed, more or less, with reed marshes, out of which issues constant running water ; and also in many places with flat, wet weather ponds, holding water in winter, and becoming dry in summer. After this, comes in the prairies. These are wide spreading plains, of a level, or gently waving land, without timber, clothed in grass, herbage, and flowers, insulated by narrow skirts of rich interval woodland; and exhibiting, in the month of May, the most enchanting scenery imaginable. The soil is generally of a fine black rich cast, and has the appear ance of great fertility. Should they prove to be as pro ductive as the soil promises, they will be of great value, as the expense and labour of cleariug land will here be saved ; and the soil being of such a quality as will not wash away, the land must be very durable. These prairies extend nearly, or quite to the ridge ; and as the country \u00a3 open, dry, and airy, it promises to be healthy. Tht"], [677, "STATE OF ALABAMA. 655 \u00a9nly objection to this part of the country seems to be the Want of water. This inconvenience, however, may pro bably bo removed to a considerable extent by digging of wells. This objection applies to most of the tract within the limits mentioned, except the land immediately on the rivei , a d distant from it from one to three miles. In this ratine there is an abundance of cool and pleasant spring water, issuing from the bluffs and reedy heads already mentioned. Several large creeks water this district, wbich will afford good wteter navigation for small boats, of suffi cient size to transport the produce ofthe incumbent farms to t!m river. The principal of these are the Catoma, Pin cohna, Polahla, and Bitr swamp creek, all of which afford extensive bottoms of rich cai;e brake and beech swamp. Families living on and near the river, except in select places, will be subject to intermittent and bilious fevers ; but they have hitherto appeared to be of a mild kind. After passing the ridge, we enter into a country of very different character and features from that just noticed. It is generally pine land, intersected with innumerable creeks, rivulets, and brauches, running southwardly into the bay of Escambia. The head waters of Conecuh, which is the principal river emptying into the bay, spread out over a large extent of country. The creeks and branches have wide swamps, aud are in general too low and wet for cultivation. They abound in the finest tim ber, particularly white oak of a superior growth, swamp red oak of uncommon size and beauty, beech, maple, poplar, gum, and cypress. The undergrowth is reed and cane, palmettos, rattan, grape vines, and china brier. These swamps afford the finest stock range imaginable, particularly for hogs ; as besides the immense quantity of oak and beech mast, there is a great variety and plenty of ground nuts and roots, easily attainable in the soft soil or mud of those swamps. On the margins of the creeks there are generally found strips of good land from a quarter to half a mile wide. In places it is very rich, bearing oak, hickory, ash, and sometimes walnut trees. Next to this is very often found a skirt of rich pine land, dark mulatto soil, with hickory, buckeye, and shrubbery characteristic of rich land. From this kind of land there is a gradual declension to the poor pine woods. On the heads of the numerous branches of Conecuh approaching the ridge, there is a skirt of oak and hickory lard five or six miles, running parallel with the ridge. The soil is mostly ofa free, soft, gray quality ; Sometimes it is fonnd rich, strong and red, clothed with"], [678, "656 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. an agreeable mixture of oak, hickory, pine, poplar, ash, chesnut, and dogwood, &c. Of the mineral productions of this country, the most remarkable is the large quantity of stone, having the appearance of volcanic lava, lying in brokeu fragments, covering the tops and sides of many ofthe hills compos- ing the ridge, exhibiting evident marks of having once been in a state of fusion. There are also several places on the head branches of the Conecuh, where there are indications of iron ore in considerable quantities, and judging of it from its weight and ferruginous aspect, it is probably rich. Among the small prairies on the western extremity of their range, there are inexhaustible quarries of limestone or solid blocks of white hard calcareous rock. Amongst this limestone there are also found many testaceous petri- factions, particularly the oyster, clam, and cackle shells, some of which are remarkably large, retaining their original form, and exhibiting, on their outside, all the lines and nitches of the shell in its natural state, and on the inside almost as perfect a polish as when the shell was first opened. These beds of limestone are great natural curiosities, whether they are considered in regard to their origin, or the process by which these substances have been changed from their original texture to their present state of petri faction ; and while they afford a rich subject for specula tion for the naturalist and philosopher, they also supply the mechanic with an excellent material in masonry and architecture. The region watered by the Mobile river and its con fluent streams, has gained, within one or two years past, an attention from the American and foreign emigrant, that the softness of the climate and the extreme variety of the soil will long preserve. There are many extremely valuable vegetables not yet introduced into the United States, which might, from the great diversity of seasons, soil, and climate, be easily cultivated with advantage. There is, perhaps, scarcely one vegetable ever reared out of the tropics, that might not, in some situation or other, be brought to maturity in the United States. Civil divisions, towns, population, &c. \u2014 In 1816, whett the census of Alabama was taken, the number of coun ties was nine, and the population amounted to 33,287, of whom 10,439 were slaves. Since that period, the spirit"], [679, "STATE OF ALABAMA. 657 of emigration to this fine country has prevailed to such an extent, that iu December, 1818, the inhabitants petition ed congress to be admitted as an independent state into the Union ; aud at that time thirteen new counties had been added, making the whole number twenty-two. On the 2d of March, 1819, au act passed for enabling the people to call a conveution at the town of Huntsville, on the first Monday iu July following, for the purpose of form ing a state constitution ; a copy of which has not yet been received in this country. The following are the names of the counties, with their white aud black population in 1816 ; no return has been yet received from the new counties. Counties. Whites. Slaves. Total. Chief Towns.

Of tbe towns that have been begun in the valley ofthe Mobile, the most important are Mobile, Blakely, Fort St. Stephens, and FortClaiborne. The town of Mobile stands on the head of the bay, and west of the river of the same name, and was amongst the first established in Louisiana by the French. It is built upon a high bank of the bay, is regularly laid out, and of an oblong figure; the site is dry and commanding, but the approach of the harbour, for vessels drawing more than eight feet water, is difficult and circuitous. In consequence of the marshes to the north-west of the town, the inhabitants are visited with fevers and agues. The whole number of buildings is about 300, and there are many elegant houses, inhabit ed by French, English, Scotch, and Irish. The town has made great progress since 1816 ; several stores and ware houses have been recently established, improvements of all kinds are going on with spirit, and its foreign trade feist increasing. In September, 1818, a census of the in hab tants was taken, when the numbers were found to be as follow :"], [680, "658 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. White males above 21 years of age, 317 ; under do. 105 422 White females above 21, 96; under do. 87 . . 183 Free blacks, 149 ; slaves 374 523 Making a total of . .1128 But from the daily increase of new settlers, consisting of merchants, mechanics, families, &c it was supposed the population would be nearly doubled before the end of that year. Towards the lower part of the town stands fort Charlotte, taken by general Wilkinson iu 1812; it is a regular built fortress, with commodious barracks. The trade of Mobile is already considerable; the chief articles of export are lumber, pitch and tar, lur, cotton, beef and pork, rice and Indian corn. \u2014 Distant from New Orleans 173 miles, from Washington 1,046, and from Pensacola, the capital of West Florida, 33 miles\u2014 N. lat. 30\u00b0 40'. Blakely stands upon the east side of Mobile bay, ia 30\u00b0 43' N. lat. This town has been only established about three years ; it has some pre-eminent advantages over Mobile ; one of which is, that the same wind that enables a vessel to enter Mobile bay, will carry her to tbe wharfs of Blakely, which is not the case respecting Mobile ; an other is, an open road to the rapidly improving country on the Alabama river. Blakely, it is most likely, will become the mart of the Mobile river; there isa vigorous competition between the two towns at present, but the obvious superiority of the situation of Blakely, will pro bably be decisive in its savour. A good road can be found along the dividing ridge separating the branches of the Conecuh and Escambia from those of Alabama ; and the di-tanee from Mobile to Fort Claiborne, by this route, is thirty miles shorter than that by St. Stephens. The main road from Georgia to New Orleans will probably strike Mobile bay at this point. Fort St. Stephens is established on the west bank ofthe Tombigbee, eighty mites above Mobile, in N. lat. 31\u00b0 33'. It stands at the head of schooner navigation, and is in a state of rapid improvement; containing about 300 houses, about twenty stores, a printing-office, and an academy. It is a healthy pleasant place, and very advantageously situated for commerce ; the amount of the mercantile business already done at this town, exceeds 500,000 dollars annually. In its vicinity is the most wealthy and best popu la ed country on the waters of the Mobile. Baldwin, Wash ington, aud Clarke counties, have all received great acces* eions of population within the last five years. Property"], [681, "STATE OF ALABAMA. 659 continues to rise in value, notwithstanding the unbounded quantity of public land opened for settlement. The advantage of occupying the point between boat and ship navigation, confers great importance on this place: what ever towns may arise, either above or below, yet it must still retain its relative rank. By act of congress, Fort St. Stephens has been appoint ed the seat of government for the state of Alabama, until otherwise directed by the legislature thereof. It has been found, in many instances in the United States, that nothing but commercial facility can augment, to any con siderable extent, the wealth or population of towns; and that their being selected for the seats of legislature, or courts of justice, gives but trivial comparative advan tage. It is therefore of very little consequence to the people of St. Stephens, whether it remains the seat of government or otherwise. Fort Claiborne, on Alabama river, occupies the same relative position on that stream, that Fort St. Stephens does on the Tombigbee. The former town has entirely risen since the end of the last war between the United States and Great Britain. Four years ago there was not a cabin on the spot where it now stands, and it is com puted that the town at present contains 2,700 inhabitants. Like all other places in the valley of the Mobile, it is in a state of prosperous advance. Although the whole of the land still belongs to the Indians, there are a court house and jail, as well as a variety of public buildings, erected for the purpose of public justice and of domestic comfort ; but it is with regret it is stated, that in Septem ber, 1818, the jail was crowded with prisoners, some of whose cases were of a highly atrocious nature. One of the persons confined was an Indian, and had been in dicted for the murder of a white man ; six or eight white men had been charged with having murdered several Indian prisoners, who were shot when bound, and pass ing under the protection of a guard. A disposition hap pily prevails among the new settlers in this district, to repress such outrages, and to prosecute every species of offence against the laws and the public peace of the country. The town of Fort Claiborne is also at the head of schooner navigation ; of course the chance of its perma nency rests upon the same principles of calculation that have been applied to Fort St. Stephens. Huntsville, in Madison county, is a thriving village, seated amid a wealthy and industrious settlement. 4p"], [682, "660 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. It would be difficult to state the number of houses or people in many of the new towns that are annually rising in this country. In reality, the numbers change so rapidly, that no estimate can remain one year correct. It would be useless to attempt any precise enumeration of the com ponent parts of a mass so incessantly accumulating. There are many flourishing settlements extending from Mobile point to Fort Jackson, on the Coosa ; and on the Alabama the country is pretty well settled near the river, twenty-five miles above Fort Jackson. On the Conecuh, Cahaba, and Black Warrior, the population is rapidly advancing ; but below St. Stephens, the country is thinly settled ; between the Alabama and Tombigbee the settle ments are fast increasing. The borders of the Conecuh is the favourite district for the poorer class of people, and stock-owners ; it being better calculated for men of small capital than the Alabama. The rapidity of the settlement of Madison county, is probably without a parallel in the history of the Uuion. The Creeks, or Muscogees, are the only Indians inha biting this state, and reside chiefly on the waters of the Alabama and Chatahouchy, in about thirty towns. They are a brave and sensible people, who raise stock, and cultivate the soil ; and though greatly reduced by war and famine, in 1814, yet their number at this time exceeds 20,000 souls. MISSOURI TERRITORY. Situation, Boundaries, and Extent. This immense region is situated between 26\u00b0 and 49* 37' N. lat. and 12\u00b0 and 49\u00b0 30' W. long. It is bounded on the north by Upper Canada and the vast unsettled country lying to the west of that province ; south, by Louisiana and the gulf of Mexico ; east, by Upper Canada, North-west territory, and the states of Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi, and Louisiana ; west, by the Pacific ocean ; and south-west by the Spanish internal provinces. Its length, from east to west, is about 1,680 miles, and its breadth, from north to south, 1,380 miles; containing about 1,580,000 square miles, or 1,011,200,000 acres. As only a small portion of this extensive country is yet purchased from the natives, the description will"], [683, "MISSOURI TERRITORY. 661 be principally coufined to those parts occupied by the settlements ofthe white people. That fertile section, of which St. Louis is the chief town, having been hitherto governed as a territory; it may uot be improper in this place to notice the difference between a territorial government and that of an inde- pendent st;.te. There now remains only three territories iu the Union, viz. Missouri, Michigan, aud North-western; each of which has a certain form of government pre- scribed by a special ordinance of congress, the principal regulations of which are, that the religious and political rights of the members of the community shall be guaran- teed ; the writ of habeas corpus, trial by jury, and the liberty of the press, to be held sacred ; that all offences shall be bailable ; and that schools and the means of education shall be for ever encouraged. A governor and secretary is appointed by the president of the United States, and the people send one delegate to the general congress; but cannot be represented in the senate until they become sufficiently numerous to form a state consti- tution. Whenever any of the territories shall have 60,000 free inhabitants, they shall be erected into a state, to be admitted by its representatives, into the congress of the United States, on an equal footing with tbe original states. The Missouri territory having acquired sufficient population to become an independent state, application has been made to the general government for its admis- sion; and it is supposed that in the session of congress which is to assemble in November, 1819, authority will be granted for forming it into the twenty-fourth state of the Union : the district of Maine having assumed that rank since the first part of this Work has been printed off. \u2014 That portion of the present Missouri territory lying south of 30\u00b0 31' N. lat., known by the name of the \" Arkansas country,\" and which is not included in the proposed state of Missouri, is to be placed under a terri torial government. Rivers, lakes, and mountains. \u2014 Nature has divided the Missouri territory into two very distinct portions, but of unequal superficies. Of the settled part of this region, 82,600 square mites lie south, and about 16,000 north of the Missouri river; the entire area spreading over 98,600 square miles. A ridge of hills leaves the Mississippi river within a short distance above the mouth of Ohio ; and extending south-west, divides the waters that flow south"], [684, "662 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. into the St. Francis and White rivers from those whose courses are directed north-east of the Missouri and Missis sippi rivers. The southern section is the most extensive, and contains at least as great a portion of good land as the northern. The former is watered by the streams of Red, Ouachitta, Arkansaw, White, Mississippi, and St. Francis; the latter by the Osage, Missouri, Merrimack, and Mississippi rivers. The Red river merely touches the Missouri territory, and waters so small a part of its surface, that it can add but little to the topographical features of the country. Between the Arkansaw and Red rivers, at N. lat. 34\u00b0 39' and 18\u00b0 west of Washington city, rises Ouachitta. This river is formed by three branches, which pursuing an east course, unite about 200 miles below their sources, and form the river, which, below the junction, turns a little east of south, runs in a direct line 250 miles, and joins Red river thirty miles above the union of the latter and Missis sippi. In the interval, between the Ouachitta, Arkansaw, and Mississippi, there exists several smaller streams, such as the B\u0153nf, Tensaw, and Macon rivers, which all join and contribute to form Ouachitta. The Arkansaw is, after the Missouri, the longest, and in some seasons, the largest branch of the Mississippi. This great river rises nearly as high as the forty-second degree of north latitude, 33\u00b0 west of Washington city ; pursuing a south course of about 200 miles, turns south-east, 500 miles; then turns nearly at right angles, and runs north east 150 miles ; again reasumes a south-east course, which it pursues 150 mites ; then assumes an east direction, which it preserves about 450 miles, and enters the Mississippi at 34\u00b0 north lat. and 14Q west longitude. The Arkansaw greatly exceeds in length either the Mississippi proper, or Ohio. That part of Arkansaw that traverses the Missouri territory is skirted, in great part, by extensive prairies. Spurs of the Massarene mountains often reach the river. It may be remarked as singular, that to the extent of up wards of 300 miles in the lower part of the Arkansaw, its valley is confined merely to the stream of the river ; the waters of the Ouachitta on one side, and White river on the other, rising almost from the very margin of the Arkansaw. The land npon the Arkansaw, in the Missouri territory, is in great part alluvial ; and where not subject to over flow, excellent. The timber corresponds nearly to that ofthe state of Mississippi, in similar relative situations. White river may be considered, as far as productive soil"], [685, "MISSOURI TERRITORY. 663 is concerned, one of the principal streams ofthe Missouri territory. This river is formed by the junction of Black river, and White river properly so called, and falls into the Mississippi thirty mites above the Arkansaw. Without estimating the particular bends, the White river is about 400 miles in length, following the main stream, and also 400 by the valley ofthe Black river. The region watered by White river appears to be com posed of immense strata of limestone and marble; the decomposition of which produces a most fertile soil. Some prairies exist on the White river, but are neither very fertile nor extensive. A very great similarity exists be tween the White river lands and those of Kentucky, Indiana, and West Tennessee. The lands are generally well adapted to the culture of cotton : that plant, how ever, is here more liable to be destroyed by frost than in the states of Louisiana and Mississippi ; but owing to more elevated shelter, less so than in a similar latitude in Ten- nessee. With very little exception, the White river lands are public property. A considerable number of families are settled on the various branches of this stream, but mostly on public land. Until the date of the cession of Louisiana to the United States, White river appears to have been but very imper fectly known. The French and Spanish settlements seldom extended far from the margin of the rivers, and were scattered, weak, aud defenceless. Those nations appear to have had a much better knowledge of the man ner of conciliating the savages than the English possess, or than has been evinced by the government ofthe United States. No such dispersed settlements of English or Americans, as the French and Spanish posts on the Mississippi and its tributaries, could have existed a cen tury amongst the powerful tribes of savages. The country watered by White river, has not been visited by any person whose observations have been pub lished, or who was competent to give a correct detail of its metallic productions. Like other regions where flat limestone forms the greater part of the substratum, coal may be very confidently expected to exist. Salt and gypsum must also form part of the fossil materials of this country. Its greatest natural wealth, however, is its ex tremely productive soil and moderate climate. In every respect, in point of agricultural, commercial, and political advantages, this is a place of great, and it may be antici pated, not delusive promise. The rivers Missouri and Mississippi, the latter of which washes the frontier of this"], [686, "664 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. territory upwards of 2,000 miles, have been described in pages 22 and 23. St. Francis river rises about 100 miles northward ofthe mouth of the Ohio; its general course is nearly south, receiving several streams from the east ; one of which ap pears to have been an ancient outlet of the Mississippi. The country on St. Francis is not either so fertile or ex tensive as that watered by White river. The entire length of the former is about 200 miles, and falls into the Missis sippi ninety-two miles above the mouth of Arkansaw. The intermediate country between the White and St. Francis rivers is low overflowed land for a distance of up wards of 100 miles above their mouths. The same remark is applicable to the lands between the St. Francis aud Mississippi. Upon the margin of the latter, in this part of the Missouri territory, the soil is similar to that found to border that stream from the mouth of the Ohio to within forty miles of the gulf of Mexico. Osage river, rises in the same ridges with the main stream ofthe grand river of Arkansaw, aud flowing north east about 400 miles in a direct course, enters the territory of Missouri, through wbich it flows 250 miles, and joins the Missouri river at 39\u00b0 40' north lat. and 14\u00b0 10' west Ion. from Washington city. Though contiguous to the country watered by White river, the climate on the Osage is sensibly colder. As soon as the diverging ridge between those two streams is passed, a change in vegetation and the seasons is appa rent. Here, for the first place, from the gulf of Mexico, appears to commence a region in every respect congenial to the growth of wheat, rye, and other small grain. The country watered by the Osage river is generally prairie ; some spots are extremely fertile ; but from the united testimony of all persons who have visited this region, it is generally poor, gravelly, and badly watered. The same remark may be extended to the northern parts, drained by the White river waters. West of the line of demarkation, between the land sold by the Osage Indians, and that still possessed by that tribe, the country is very imperfectly known. The Merrimack is a small unimportant stream, rising between the Missouri and heads of St. Francis and White rivers. Its course is nearly east, and it is about 150 miles long. The country north of the Missouri abounds with lakes and ponds. Lake Despice forms the grand reservoir of the Little Sioux, and is seventy miles in circumference."], [687, "-MISSOURI TERRITORY. 665 West ofthe head branches of Mississippi are Packagamau, remarkable for the wild rice which grows in its water. Lake Winuipiqne, of au oval form, thirty-six mites in circumference, Leech, and Otter-tail lakes, ln the south, along the valleys of the Washita, White river, and St. Francis, small lakes are numerous. The Massarene mountains extend westwardly from near the Mississippi to the sources of the Red river, and give to the country west of the Washita a rugged appear ance. The Massareue chain is a prolongation of the Chippewan, and rises in detached masses, between Red and Arkansaw rivers. This range has not been carefully examined by men of science : of course its component parts are not correctly known. It is supposed to be rich in minerals, and there are ample indications of iron. The Black mountains run nearly parallel to the Missouri, from the head of the river Kanzas. The Rocky mountains, noticed in page 38, constitute a formidable boundary on the west aud north-west, at the distance of 1,400 miles from the river Mississippi. Aspect of the country, climate, soil, and productions. \u2014 In such an amazing extent of territory, the face of the country must be exceedingly diversified. Towards the south the land is low, and in many places overflowed by rivers ; to the north it becomes elevated, frequently swell ing out into large hills; and towards the west there are very lofty mountains. On all the rivers there are exten sive alluvial tracts ; this land, when not subject to inun dation, \"is of the first quality, and is apparently but little exhausted by producing a long series of crops. Between the bayous of St. Francis and the Louisiana boundary line, the Mississippi, St. Francis, and Arkansaw, annually over flow considerable tracts, which in many places produce irreclaimable swamps. Two hundred miles west of the Mississippi river, the arable soil of the country experi ences a total change. Beyond that limit an extensive desert commences, which extends to the Pacific ocean. Though this vast region is not an extended uninterrupted expanse of unproductive land, yet the greatest part of the distance is prairie* devoid of timber, or else a hard gravelly soil. The rivers are remarkable for their great length and little water ; no lakes of any extent are found, and in seasons of dry weather, an extreme want of water is experienced by all persons who traverse this uninviting \u2022 See page 10-. \u2014Note."], [688, "666 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. waste. The banks of the Missouri are, like those of the Mississippi, alluvial, and subject to inundation ; yet the country may be said to be fertile from the mouth of the Missouri westwardly, as far as the river Kanzas, 342 miles, and northwardly, up the Mississippi, as far as the Great Sac river. Boone's Lick country, now Howard county, is, no doubt, the richest considerable body osgood land in the Missouri territory ; and is equal, if not superior, to the best part of Kentucky. It commences at the mouth of the Great Osage river, 133 miles above St. Louis, and runs up said river to the boundary line of the Osage Indians ; thence north with that line to the Missouri ; thence up the Mis souri to a point opposite the Kanzas river ; thence north ward 140 miles ; thence eastward to the main dividing ridge of high ground between the Mississippi and Mis souri rivers ; thence along the said ridge to the head of the main branch of Cedar river ; thence down this river to the Missouri, aud down the Missouri to Osage river, or place of beginning ; containing about 30,000 square miles, one half of which is first rate land, and but little that is unfit for cultivation : three-fifths are prairie. The first settlement of this country was made in 1805, for the purpose of making salt; and has since been occu pied for salt works. Farmers did not settle until the fall of 1811, when about twenty settled in Boone's Lick bot tom ; but their number increased slowly on account of the Indians during the late war. In November, 1815, the population amounted to 526 free white males, and it was formed into a separate county of the above boundary and name. In August, 1817, it contained 1,050 white males ; when the site of a town was fixed by the county commis sioners, on the bank of the Missouri, in a very eligible situation. The face of the country is neither mountainous nor hilly, yet a great part of it is uneven ground ; there is great uniformity throughout this large county, and but little diversity, of soil, stone, or timber. The Missouri runs through the county; the other navigable rivers are the Great Osage, Mine river, and Kanzas, from the south ; the Charlatan, Grand river, and Little Platte from the north, besides numerous small streams. Minerals of various kinds are found here ; among which are, iron in abundance, lead, tin, copper, zinc, silver (rare) sulphur, alum, copperas, saltpetre, &c. In some parts of the county salt is procured in abundance; the maiu branch of Mine river, called the Salt fork, is generally"], [689, "667 -MISSOURI TERRITORY. as salt as sea water, from the month of June to November. On the Osage river coal can be raised in any quantity. The country abounds in medicinal plants, from among which the Indians select some that are capable of curing the most inveterate venereal complaints. The natives also cure the bite of the rattlesnake, likewise rheuma tisms of long standing, and are remarkable for their suc cessful treatment of gun-shot wounds : the Great Osage Indians are most skilled in mediciue. Agriculture is not sufficiently attended to, although the country is extremely fertile. One acre of land will pro duce 100 bushels of prime Indian corn, fifty do. of wheat, sixty pounds to the bushel, and 1,000 lbs. of Carolina cot ton in the seed. Hemp, flax, and every article of husbandry, except tobacco, which does not thrive well, (though none of the farmers ean tell the reason,) can be raised in greater abundance, than in any county near the same lati tude in the United States. A public road has been opened from Potosi (the lead mines in Washington county) which will greatly facilitate the intercourse with the states. The air in this part of the country is less liable to sud den changes than in the eastern sections of the territory. Chilling cold is seldom experienced, except when the north-west winds break across the vast extent of prairies which lie towards the northern regions ; that wind, how ever, seldom continues longer than eight hours. The spring season opens about the middle of March with heavy rains, which continue at intervals until the end of April, and from that time to the first of August there is but little rain : weather hot, with frequent thunder and lightning. Diseases are but little known in this agreeable climate; those most frequent are remittent fevers; but the most troublesome disorder is the influenza, well known, and often fatal, in Great Britain, about the year 1783. It is probable, however, that diseases will be introduced with wealth and dissipation. The place selected for a town is nearly in the centre of the largest body of rich land in this territory, and is situ ated in about 38\u00b0 43' N. lat. It is 150 miles west of St. Louis ; 158 from the mouth of the Missouri by land, 180 by water; from St. Charles, 130; from Grand river,* which falls into the Missouri, twenty-four ; from the Great * Near the mouth of Grand river will stand, at some future day, the capital of the Missouri country. It is in the centre of the level lands, and is the most de lightful situation in the western territory. From this spot to the Mississippi, at the nearest point, is only eighty-four miles across a beautiful country, dry, open, aud pleasant. 4 ."], [690, "668 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. Osage town, 100; the same distance from the Mississippi 5 and 130 from the town of Potosi. The principal articles of trade are salt, live stock, beef, pork, beaver, tallow, bees-wax, honey, peltries, saltpetre, and grain. The inhabitants are composed of different religious persuasions. At present the state of education is at a very low ebb ; but as the people are only in the first stage of their political existence, it may be reasonably expected that they will soon emerge from their darkness and obscurity. Between Boone's Lick and the fort, the land south of the river is one extended prairie, except about 100 sections of good woodland, extending about twenty miles down the river from the fort. One or two creeks pass through this tract, sufficient for small machinery or grist mills. The prairie lies well, and is scarcely inferior iu point of soil to the river bottom. The fort is in N. lat. 39\u00b0 5', and stands on the brow of a hill within 100 yards of the river. It commands a full view of five miles east, down, and two miles north up the river. From the fort to the Osage river, seventy-six miles, the land is altogether prairie, except some little spots on the creeks, not any where sufficient for a settlement. A great proportion of the land, so far, is of good quality and lies well. On the north side of the Osage river there is a very extensive bottom of the finest quality, and on the south side another of secondary quality. Upon the latter plain stand some high mounds of earth, from one of which a view may be taken of 500 square miles of land, nearly all of the first rate ; timber and springs only are wanting to make this one of the finest parts of the world. About 130 miles further, in the same direction, the woody country begins, and the land becomes poorer as you approach it. Here are found the first running streams, except the Osage; they all run west, and are waters of the grand river Arkansaw: after entering the timbered land, there is little more prairie to be seen. At the dis tance of 200 miles is the head water of the Buffalo fork of White river ; 254 miles brings you to the river Arkan saw, about sixty miles above the Cherokee village. The wood land through this distance is poor, stony, and ap proaching to mountainous ; game plentiful, but no buffalo until near the waters of White river. The same kind of soil and surface continues down to the Cherokee village ; from thence for about twenty miles east, to the mouth of tbe Quadrant, the land somewhat improves, though it is still rather poor. The river bottom is generally rich,"], [691, "669 MISSOURI TERRITORY. though not very extensive, and somewhat subject to inun- dation. From the Quadrant, by the usual route to St. Louis, the soil is mostly poor, aud the country broken ; yet there is some very good bottom land on the tributary streams of White river and St. Francis, and many spots might be selected fit for cultivation, though not enough to give a character to the country. The late geueral Pike describes the district round the Osage villages, as one of the most beautiful the eye ever beheld. The three branches of the river, viz. the east, middle, aud northern forks, all wind round and pass the villages, affording the important advantages of wood and water ; while the extensive prairies, crowned with rich and luxuriant grass and flowers, gently diversified by rising swells and sloping lawns, present to the warm imagination the future seats of husbandry, and the nume- rous herds of domestic animals, which are no doubt des- tined to crown with joy these happy plains. From the Osage towns to the source of the Osage river, in lat. 36\u00b0 N., there is no difference in the appearance of the coun- try ; except that on the south and east, the view on the prairies becomes unbounded, and is only limited by the shortness of our sight. The waters of the White river and the Osage, are divided merely by a small ridge on the prairie, and the dry branches appear to interlock at their head ; from thence to the chief branch of the latter river, the country appears to be high and gravelly ridges of prairie land. On the main White river is large timber, and fine ground for cultivation ; but from the Verdigris to the Arkansaw, the country is composed of gravelly hills and extensive prairies, in some places well watered, but deficient in timber, except for a limited number of inha- bitants for a few years: salt springs and iron ore in abund- ance. All the country between the forks of Kanzas river, a distance of 160 miles, may be called prairie, notwith- standing: the borders of woodland which ornament the banks of those streams ; but are no more than a line traced on a sheet of paper, when compared to the immense tract of meadow country. Approaching the Arkansaw, th\u00bb land is low and swampy for the space of fifteen or twenty miles ; from thence about half way to the mountains, is a continued succession of low prairie hills, badly watered, and nearly destitute of timber. The banks ofthe Missouri are lined with vegetable riches. The northern shore, as far up as the mouth of the Gas conade, above 100 miles, is generally a low, rich bot tom, from one to two miles wide, covered with ash^"], [692, "670 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. sycamore, black walnut, &c. On the south hills, rivulets and a number of small creeks, with a rich soil, fine tim- ber, grapevines, and a luxuriant growth of cane. From the Gasconade to the entrance of the Osage, thirty-three miles, the south side of the river is hilly, but well timbered. Thus far the soil is well suited to the cultivation of the grain and agricultural products of the middle and west- cm states: the timber is various, but the cotton-wood pre- dominates. To give a precise idea of the incalculable riches scattered along the sides of the Missouri, would require unlimited knowledge. The low bottoms are covered with large trees, especially the poplar and cotton trees, large enough for the first rate canoes; the sugar maple, red and black walnut, so useful to joiners ; red and white elm, the three-thorned acacia, of which impe- netrable hedges can be made ; the osier, the red and black mulberry, lime-tree, horse-chesnut, all of which are very plentiful ; red and white oak, fit for vessels ; and on the Rocky mountains, cedar Is a common production. It is impossible to enumerate all the trees, which are yet un- known in other countries ; and with those whose uses and qualities we are as yet unacquainted. The smaller plants are still more numerous. Tbe Indians know the virtues of many of them ; some are used to poison arrows, others for dyeing colours, some again fo heal wounds, and to cure diseases. They conceal with great care, a plant which renders them for some instants insensible to the most vehement fire ; and by means of which they can hold red hot iron in their hands for several seconds, with- out injury. The lands in the neighbourhood of the Missouri are excellent, and when cultivated are capable of yielding all the productions of the temperate climates, and even some of the hot ones ; such as wheat, maize, and every kind of grain ; common and sweet potatoes ; hemp, which seems to be an indigenous vegetable ; even cotton suc- ceeds here, though not so well as further south ; and the raising of it answers a good purpose for the families already settled on the river : for, from a field of about two acres, they obtain a crop sufficient to clothe a family. The natural prairies are a great resource for them. These afford excellent pasture, and require but little labour to clear them. After one year's exertion, a man may enjoy his fields duly prepared for crops. Brick and potter's earths are very common, and the true Chinese Kaolin is reported, by good judges, to be here, that substance to which porcelain owes its peculiar firmness. Aud there"], [693, "-MISSOURI TERRITORY. 671 exists on the borders of this river, salt springs, which will furnish salt in abundance for the country when it shall become inhabited. Saltpetre is found very abundantly in numberless caverns near the Missouri. The rocks are generally calcareous ; though there is one which is pecu liar to this river; it is of a blood-red colour, compact, yielding to a tool, hardening in the air, and receiving the neatest polish. There are also quarries of marble. The bottoms ofthe Mississippi afford suitable situations for settlement, from the mouth ofthe Missouri te the falls of St. Anthony, except at certain bluffs, where the soil is too barren to invite settlers. The alluvial bottoms are generally composed of a rich, sandy soil, yielding a pretty heavy growth of pecan, poplar, sugar-maple, honey locust, ash, cotton-wood, black walnut, and cucumber. The prairies in many places approach close to the river ; they are sometimes visible through the skirts of the woods. Above the Wabisapenem, the land bordering the river is three-fourths prairie, or rather bold hills, which instead of running parallel with the river, form a continual suc cesion of high, perpendicular cliffs, and low valleys; they appear to head on the river, aud to traverse the country in an angular direction. These hills and valleys give rise to sublime and romantic views. But this irregular scenery is sometime interrupted by a wide extended plain, which brings to mind the verdant lawn of civilized life ; aud would almost induce the traveller to imagine himself in the centre of a highly cultivated plantation. The timber above this, is chiefly ash, elm, cotton-wood, birch, and sugar-maple. Above the falls of St. Anthony, the pine country commences; this timber borders all the streams, except occasional tracts of sugar- maple, basswood, and beech. Of the minerals found in the Missouri territory, lead is the most abundant ; and might be raised in sufficient quantity to supply the whole world. The principal mines are upon the rivers Merrimack and Gouberie, both of which fall into the Mississippi between the mouth of the Ohio and that of the Missouri. These mines extend through a great district of country, being above fifty miles long and twenty-five broad ; but the lead reaches far beyond those limits, having been found at the confluence of the Gasconade with the Missouri, 100 miles above St. Louis, and many are of opinion that it extends to the mines belonging to the Saukee and Fox Indians, which are situated on the Mississippi, 600 miles above St. Louis. These mines are known to extend over a space of eighty"], [694, "672 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. miles in length, and nine in breadth.* Lead mines also exist on the waters Of the Washita and St. Francis. The furnaces upon the Merrimack and Gouberie smelt about 1,000 tons annually ; most of the mineral is so rich, that 100 pounds of ore will produce from eighty to ninety pounds of pure lead. The most noted mines in this dis trict are Mine le Burton,! Mine la Motte, New Diggings, American Mine, Richwood Mines, Elliot's Diggings, Mine Belle Fontaine, and Old Diggings ; some of these diggings are ten or twelve miles distant from each other; and Mine la Motte, on the river St. Francis, is thirty or forty miles south of all the rest. The mines of St. Gene vieve occupy an extent of country, the limits of which have uot yet been ascertained ; they commence about thirty miles west of the Mississippi, and extend west and north-west. The ore can be found in almost every direc tion ; the price of lead is from four to five dollars a hun dred, and shot nine dollars. Most of the above mines have been worked for about ninety years ; and until of late the ore has not been sought for in the rock, but has been found in the earth in detached lumps. The workmen employed have no other implements than a pick-axe and a wooden shovel, and \u2022 These mines are of great value to the Indians, for as the game on their lands is nearly destroyed, they have been compelled to commence the business of mining, or rather digging. The ore is raised by the men, but the operation of smelting is performed by the squaws. They first dig a deep cavity in the ground, near a per- pendicular bank of the Mississippi, and from the face of the bank make an hori- zontal hole to meet the bottom of it. A quantity of dry wood is then thrown into the cavity, and set fire lo, after which the ore is thrown in, and the supply of both continued. The metal runs out at the horizontal opening, and is received in holes made by the Indians with their heels in the sand of the river. In this state it is bought by the traders from St. Louis, who afterwards cast it into pigs in their own moulds. t The mineral at Mine le Rurlon is generally found in veins of almost every size, from three feet in circumference and urjder, and from six to twelve feet below the surface of the earth. At the New Diggings it is found from four lo thirty fees . under ground, where they are obliged to discontinue tbeir work on account of tbe water coming in upon them. They have no contrivance to draw it off, except a single bucket suspended from an arm in a crotchet, after the manner of some draw wells. There is no doubt that those grounds or mines wbich have apparently been exBausted, or abandoned on account of the water flowing in, will eventually bi\" fotiuil the richest discoveries yet made. It is evident that in no instance hav\u00ab they yet fallen upon the main bed of ore, which probably lies at such a depth as will require the sinking of a shaft to enable them to work it. Hitherto they have been contented with the small spurs or veins which are found near the surface of the earth ; but the few proprietors who have ventured to penetrate the rock, have been amply rewarded for their trouble. From one mine, four millions of pounds weight of ore was raised in the course of a summer. There is but one regular built air-furnace throughout this country, and that is at (he Mine le Burton. The expense of such a building is so great, and the mineral so plenty, that the miners prefer an open furnace, which does not cost more than forty or fifty dollars ; *herea-s a proper air furnace, like the one just mentioned, would cost 5 or 6,00<\u00bb dollars."], [695, "673 MISSOURI TERRITORY. when at work, appear as if they were making tan-pits rather than mining When they come to the rock, which is always found at the depth of from six to twelve feet below tbe surface, they quit that hole, and commence a new digging, within a few feet of that which they have abandoned. Each digger works separately for himself, and sells tbe ore to the proprietor of the mine at two dol lars per 100 lbs. The ore is then smelted in furnaces con structed of two parallel walls, one about eight, the other four feet high, and three and a half asunder ; these are joined by two sloping side walls, and info this enclosed area the fuel and ore are thrown. The mines belong to a number of proprietors, and are worked with more or less spirit, as the ore happens to be abundant or otherwise ; for the workmen quit one digging without ceremony when they hear of better success at another : therefore when the diggings become less productive than usual, the own ers make trials on different parts of the land, to discover where the ore is most abundant, that the diggers may be induced to remain with them. These trials consist of nothing more than digging holes in some parts of the woods, to the depth of three or four feet, and judging by the quantity of ore what degree of success may be expected. The number and extent of the salt rivers and springs in this territory exceed belief. No fewer than three salt streams flow into the Arkansaw, the least of which is fifty, an other seventy-five, and tbe largest 150 yards wide. It ap pears that the salt deposit passes under the Arkansaw to the north-west, and impregnates two branches of the Kanzas river. The salines in general have uncommon Strength, and they are so abundant, that almost every township will for ever have an inexhaustible supply of salt, particularly south of the Missouri. The extent of the salt region is not less than seventy-five miles square, which gives an area of 5,625 square miles. Mines of rock saH exist towards the bead branches of the Arkansaw, and sometimes approach to the surface of the earth ; when these regions become peopled, the transportation of this salt will be perfectly easy, by means of the fine river on which it is happily situated. The Grand Saline is about 280 miles south-west of Fort Osage ; it is a hard level plain of reddish-coloured sand, full thirty miles in circum ference. This plain is entirely covered in dry hot wea ther, from two to six inches deep, with a crust of beauti ful clean white salt, which bears a striking resemblance to a field of brilliant snow after rain, with a light crust"], [696, "674 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. on its top. The distance from this place to a navigable branch of the Arkansaw is about eighty miles. The Hot Springs at the head of the Washita, 302 miles from Natchez, and 458 from New Orleans, are a great natural curiosity; they are six in number, issuing from the side of a hill, the body of which is partly flint and partly freestone. Their heat is too great for the hand to bear the highest temperature is about 150 degrees, and is greatest in dry seasons. Meat has been boiled in them in a shorter time than could be accomplished by a com mon fire. The water is soft and limpid, without smell, and of an agreeable taste. It is drunk after it becomes cool, and used for every other purpose in preference to the waters of the cold springs in the vicinity. The Indians have from time immemorial resorted to them on account of their medicinal virtues. The land round the springs is called by them the \" Land of Peace ;\" for hos tile tribes frequent the waters at the same time with per fect harmony. Dr. Hunter, who visited these springs, found a green plant growing in the hot water ; but what is more remarkable, a small shell animal adhered to it, and lived in a temperature approaching to boiling heat! He beheld plants, shrubs, and trees, and a species of wild cabbage, absolutely growing and appearing healthy, while their roots were exposed to a heat of 130 degrees. He and his companion cooked the cabbage, and found it to be mild and good for food. These waters have effect ed surprising cures in chronic pains, palsy, &c. ; and per sons from a state of entire inability of motion, have been restored by the use of these springs to complete health and activity. No portion of the earth is more abundant in that most useful mineral, coal, than the Missouri territory. It appears in various parts, at the foot of the bluffs ofthe Missouri ; and on the Osage river, a bed of very great but unknown thickness, shews itself. On Red river it comes to the surface in many places, and the hunters speak of it as being one of the most common substances on the Little Missouri, upwards of 1,700 miles above St. Louis, and on the Yellow Stone river, 190 miles higher up. On the banks of tbe Mississippi, below the mouth of the Missouri, coal is found in great abundance. About four miles west of St. Louis a vein, from twelve to eighteen inches in thickness, breaks out at the edge ofa creek and is used by tie blacksmiths. In the year 1810, the grass of the prair'e n the American Bottom, about five miles east of St. Louis, took fire, and kindled the dry stump of"], [697, "MISSOURI TERRITORY. 675 a tree ; this stump set fire fo a fine bed of coal on which it stood, and the coal continued to burn for several months, until the earth fell in and extinguished it. This bed breaks out at the bottom ofthe bluffs of the Missis- sippi, and is about five feet in thickness; the same vein is found at tiie surface several miles distant. Near the vil- lage of St. Ferdinand, on the edge ofthe Missouri, four- teen miles from St. Louis, the bank is one solid bed of fine coal, of unknown thickness, but certainly more than twenty feet. Besides the minerals above enumerated, iron, tin, zinc, copper, and saltpetre are found in abundance. The ex- istence of silver ore about the head of the Arkansaw aud Red river is believed by the inhabitants who reside iu those districts, and various accounts are current amongst them of its having been discovered there by hunters. As those rivers rise in the range of mountains in which the mines of Santa Fe are situated, and not far distant from them, the account is very probable. l The climate of the new settlements upon the Missouri river has been already noticed ; that in the neighbour- hood of St. Louis, and for a considerable distance above and below that town upon the banks of the Mississippi, is very fine. The spring commences about the middle of March, at which time the willow, the elm, and maples are in flower ; the spring rains usually occur in May, after which month the weather continues fine, almost without interruption until September, when rain again occurs about the equinox, after which it remains serene weather uutil near Christmas, when the winter commences. About the beginning or middle of October what is called the Indian summer begins, and is immediately known by the change which takes place in the atmosphere, as it now becomes hazy, or what they term smoky. This gives to the sun a red appearance, and takes away the glare of light, so that all the day, except a few hours about noon, he may be looked at with the naked eye without pain. The winters are sharp ; but it may be oberved that less snow falls, and they are much more moderate on the west than on the east side of the Allegany mountains in similar lati tudes. It is necessary, however, to remark, that what has been stated relative to the climate, duration of winter, &c. relates more particularly to the region included betwixt New Madrid, forty-five mites below the mouth of the Ohio, and the junction of the Missouri and Mississippi, or from 36\u00b0 30' to 39 \\\u00b0 N. lat ; but as this territory extends from 2G\u00b0 to 49\u00b0 37', therefore proper allowances must be NO. .XXIX. 4 R"], [698, "676 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. made for the differences of latitude. The observations oa climate may be concluded by stating, that the same causes produce the same effects in this country as in other places; the greatest and most durable cold is found in parts high est and most exposed to the north ; the longest and most extensive heat in low places, sheltered from the north and open to the south winds. In an agricultural point of view, the settled part of this territory may be divided into three regions, suitable for the culture of as many great staple articles, viz. sugar, cotton, aud grain. The sugar region reaches from the gulf of Mexico to 31\u00b0 N. lat. ; the country proper for the cultivation of cotton, and too cold for that of sugar-cane, extends from 31\u00b0 to about 36\u00b0; it will grow many degrees further north, but will not yield a sufficient crop, nor i\u00ab the cotton so good iu quality. The remaining inhabited part of the territory is admirably adapted for the produc tion of the different kinds of grain, and of every article of culture raised in the best gardens. A well cultivated field will produce, one year with another, sixty bushels of Indian corn, and thirty-five of wheat per acre. There is no part of the western country that holds out greater advantages to the new settler than the Missouri territory. It is inferior to no part in point of soil or climate, and has a decided superiority over the country on the Ohio ; as the passage to New Orleans may be made at any season of the year, whereas the river Ohio is not navigable during the months of August, September, and October : it has also the important advantage of being from 600 to 1,000 miles neater to that great commercial city than the upper part of the Ohio. Opportunities of purchasing settlements or plantations, already formed, are frequent, and on very moderate terms; as the rage for retiring backwards prevails here in as great a degree as in the other new countries. Wild lands, as it is called, may either be had from the government of the United States, or from the old French inhabitants, several of whom possess very large tracts, obtained by grants from the Spanish governors. The titles of these lands are now undoubted, as they have been ratified by the com- missioners appointed by congress to examine into claims. The price of land is various, but may frequently be ob- tained on better terms from the land owners than from the government, or for less than two dollars an acre. In the reclaiming of wild land, or the forming of a planta tion from a stale of nature, the trouble and labour is much legs than in clearing a forest ; as here the trees are not"], [699, "MISSOURI TERRITORY. 677 more abuudant on the upland than would be necessary for fuel and for fences. They naturally stand at a sufficient distance from each other to admit a fine undergrowth of grass and herbage. This country will reap incalculable benefit from the application of steam-boats on the Missis- sippi ; and this mode of conveyance will be much facili- tated by the abundance of excellent coal so uuiversally spread over these regions. The Indian title, by various treaties, has been extin- guished to about 70,000 square miles, or 43,000,000 acres; a tract of country nearly as large as the states of Ohio and Kentucky. (See Appendix.) Between lat. 35\u00b0 and 40\u00b0 N., and long. 10\u00b0 to 12\u00b0 W , 2,500,000 acres of lands for the United States' army have been laid out and sur- veyed. This tract is watered by the Missouri, Gasconade, John's river, Gravel, Great Osage, &c. and is chiefly of first quality, prairie and woodland interspersed; the tim- bered land is covered with tall canes, a sure indication of a. warm and productive soil. These lands are capable of sustaining a numerous population, and from the advan- tageous local situation, will rapidly enhance in value. Emigration to this promising district continues to an un- paralleled extent ; as it is probably the easiest unsettled country in the world to commence farming in. The emi- grant has only to fix himself on tbe edge of a prairie, and he has the one half of bis farm a heavy forest, and the other half a fertile plain or meadow, covered with a thick sward of fine grass; he has then only to fenoe in his ground and put in his seed. The country abounds with salines and salt works sufficient to supply the inhabitants with o-ood salt: and there is a navigation to almost every man's door^ which will give him a market for his surplus produce, and bring to him all the necessary articles of merchandise. The soil and climate of these bounty lands are favourable to the growth of Indian corn, wheat, rye, oats, cotton, tobacco, hemp, flax, and almost every kind of vegetable that grows in the United States. \u2014 Take the country sor all in all, there is no section of the Union has ever opened such a great and advantageous field for enterprise, either for the industrious working man, or for the steady professional character. Nature has been bountiful to the native Indians resident on the waters of the Missouri and Mississippi. The buffalo abounds from the plains of Assinnibion, in 50\u00b0 N. lat., to the confines of Louisiana, and from the Mississippi to the Rocky mountains : their hides and tallow are important articles of the commerce of the territory. Lieutenant"], [700, "678 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. Pike, whose route was up the O.sage river to the Great Osage village, from thence across the head streams ofthe Kauzas and White river to the Arkansaw, and thence up that river to the Mexican mountains, found no difficulty in supplying himself and party with abundance of flesh meat, from the vast herds of buffaloes through which he passed; the females of which produce beef equal to any in the world. He affirms, that he does not think it an ex aggeration to say, that he saw 3,000 buffaloes in one drove; the face of the earth appearing to be covered with them. The borders of the Arkansaw may be termed the paradise of North America for the wandering savages. Of all the countries visited by the footsteps of civilized man, there never was one probably that produced game in greater abundance. It is not doubted, that there are buffalo, elk, and deer, on the banks of the Arkansaw alone, if used without waste, sufficient to feed all the Indians in the United States for a hundred years. The great brown bear of the Upper Missouri is a terri ble animal ; and the extreme difficulty with which they are kilted, renders them a dangerous and formidable enemy to man. Nothing but a shot through the brains will stop their career, aud this is a very difficult operation, ou account of two large muscles which cover the side of the forehead, and the sharp projection of the frontal bone, which is also very thick. One of them, after seven balls had passed through him, has been known to pursue six men, who only saved themselves by leaping down a perpendicular bank of twenty feet into a river ; the bear plunged aftei them, and was within a few feet of tbe hindmost, when a hunter from the shore shot him in the head, and finally killed him. Another of these ferocious animals of a monstrous size, after having been shot through the centre of the lungs, pursued the hunter furiously for half a mile, then returned more than twice that distance, and with his talons prepared himself abed in the earth, two feet deep and five long, where he was found perfectly alive two hours after be had received his mortal wound. Wild horses are found in immense drovesonthe prairies between the Arkansaw and Red river, they are very fleet iind difficult to be taken, which is accomplished by expert riders, and swift tame horses, who throw a noose over their necks with amazing dexterity. Deer, elk, bear, wolves, panthers, and antelopes, are numerous; wolves and panthers follow the buffalo herds, and feast on the calves. The grizzly, or white bear, is sound on the head branches of the Missouri ; it is equally ferocious as the"], [701, "-MISSOURI TERRITORY. 679 great brown bear, and often attacks she Indians. Cabree and moose are plentiful ; but Rocky mountain sheep are the most common animals. Their horns are a great curi osity, shaped like those of the common sheep, but enor mous in size, full of knobs, and measuring fhree feet in length, five inches in diameter near the head, and weigh ing twenty pounds and upwards. This animal is taller than a deer, and has a larger body ; it is covered with soft dun-coloured hair, except on the belly, which is white. Its legs and leet resemble those of the domestic sheep, and it possesses uncommon agility, climbing cliffs and steep mountains with such ease that no other animal cau follow it; its flesh is considered equal to that ofthe deer. Beaver abound from the Missouri river through out the Sioux country, and in most parts of the territory. There are several species of wild cats; they are small, but very fierce, and often kill sheep and cabree, by leap ing on their necks and eating away the sinews and arteries, until they fall, when they suck their blood. The lynx, marten, muskrat, and ermine, are common. The prairie dogs reside on the prairies south ofthe Missouri, in towns aud villages, having an evident police establishment in their communities. The sites of these towns are gene rally on the brow of a hill, near some creek or pond, in order to be convenient to water, and yet exempt from inundation ; their residence is in burrows, which descend in a spiral form. Into one of these holes 140 kettles of water have been poured, with a view to drive out the in habitants, but without success. They never travel more than half a mile from their homes, and readily associate with rattlesnakes. They are of a dark brown colour, ex cept their bellies, which are red. They are somethings larger than a gray squirrel, and very fat; supposed to live upon grain and roots. Their villages sometimes extend over two or three miles square, in which there must be innumerable hosts of them, as there is generally a burrow every eight or ten steps. Civil divisions, towns, settlements, population, &e. \u2014 In 1810, when the general census of the United States was taken, this territory was divided into seven districts, containing 20,845 inhabitants, including 3,011 slaves; in the seven years succeeding that period, the influx of emigrants had been so considerable, that in the year 1817, the population amounted to 50,000, of whom 6,501 were enrolled in the militia: at present tbe number of inhabitants is estimated at upwards of 72,000."], [702, "680 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

Seven. 20,845 In describing the settlements from north to south, the new village of Franklin, upon the Missouri river, noticed iu page 54, is first in place. This infant town has made rapid progress in population ; which is chiefly composed of emigrants from Tennessee, Kentucky, North Carolina, and Virginia. It already contains a great number of genteel habitations, many merchants' storehouses, a court house, and all appendages of a seat of justice ; a news paper is also published, and there are two or three respect able preachers, and several common schools. Merchants, traders, lawyers, physicians, and licensed tavern-keepers have established themselves here, and mechanics, such as smiths, joiners, saddlers, masons, and a variety of others, find their account in removing to this place. Two other towns have been laid off in the same district, in which the lots sell at a high price. St. Charles is a handsome village, settled by the French, but at present containing many American families. It stands upon the left shore of the Missouri, twenty-four miles above its mouth, and twenty-one from St. Louis, by land, over an excellent road, and through a rich country, principally prairie land. Tbis town was founded in 1780, and lies along the bank of the river about a mile ; the main street occupying the first bank, the second the top ofthe hill : in this street is situated a round wooden tower, for merly occupied by the Spaniards as a fort or guard-house. The town contains at present about 200 houses, and 1,200 inhabitants. St. Charles' district occupies the peninsula between Mississippi and Missouri rivers ; the settlements extend ing along both to a considerable distance : the soil is per haps unexcelled upon the face of the earth. Exclusive of the two great rivers which bound the district on the north east sides, it is intersected with a number of smaller streams, affording partial inland navigation and mill-seats. The country is undulating but not mountainous, the soil"], [703, "-MISSOURI TERRITORY. 681 deep and strong; timber and good water are abundant. The prairie lands along the Mississippi are the only ex ceptions where these advantages are not enjoyed by the inhabitants. Extensive bottoms are found skirting all the large, aud many of the smaller streams ; those on the Missouri are clothed with wood, and but rarely inunda ted. Commencing at the mouth of the Missouri, a prai rie lies along the right shore of the Mississippi, which extends about seventy miles in length, from one to ten miles wide. The settlements are formed along the mar gin, and the soil is extremely fertile, yielding an ample produce to the farmers. Like the adjacent districts, St. Charles produces lead and salt ; and contains some ofthe richest mines of the latter yet known in the country : the salt springs are found chiefly upon the waters of the Mis souri. The population of this district was, in 1804, esti mated at about 1,500 persons ; in 1810, they were found augmented to upwards of 3,500, and are now more than double that number. Belle Fontaine is pleasantly situated on the south side of the Missouri, four miles above its mouth. The head quarters of the ninth military department are established here ; the barracks, officers' quarters, &e. are built of logs; and there is a palisade work, with quarters large enough for the reception of 300 men. The garrison is situated on the river bluffs, at the distance of about 450 yards from the water. The inhabitants are chiefly French. Florissant, a flourishing French village, is situated on the north side of the Missouri, about twelve miles above Belle Fontaine. The villages and settlements of Femme Osage, Cherette, Bonhomme, Gasconade, and Cote sans Desire, embellish the banks of the Missouri above St. Charles. Portage des Scioux, is a village on the right bank ofthe Mississippi, six miles above the Missouri. This village is small but increasing; it contains about fifty houses, and between 150 to 200 inhabitants. St. Louis, the capital of the Missouri territory, is plea santly situated on the west or right bank of the Mississippi, npon an elevated plain, eighteen mites by wafer below the mouth of the Missouri, fourteen above that of the Merrimack, and 1,179 (bv water) from New Orleans, at 38\u00b0 36' N. lat. and 12\u00b0 58' W. long, from Washington city. This town was founded in 1764 by some French traders, as a depot for traffic with the Indians. It has a decided advantage over any of the other towns, on account of its situation, being on a rock, elevated above the highest"], [704, "682 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. floods of the river, and immediately on its border. The buildings, about 900 in number, are scattered along three parallel streets, extending upwards of two miles upon the bank of the river, and each rising above the other, which gives the town a neat and romantic appearance. Most of the houses are built of stone, and white-washed on the outside ; and almost every house has an extensive garden or park, round which high stone-walls are built. Some ofthe buildings are very large and costly, and surrounded with galleries : the population exceeds 4,000 souls. House rent is high ; the better houses from 500 to 1,000 dollars a year. The town is increasing rapidly, and must continue to do so ; it already enjoys a considerable trade, and has a well-established bank, a respectable printing-office, from which a newspaper is published, a post-office, aud a Roman catholic chapel. Its situation taken altogether is not only advantageous, but interesting: occupying a point where so many rivers mingle their waters, an increasing, rapid, and lasting property is promised to this piace. \u2014 Including the whole country of Louisiana, St. Louis is the most cen- tral town yet built in the American Union ; and when this important circumstance, with the great confluence of navigable streams, the amazing extent of the prairies, the mildness and salubrity of the climate, and the advantages that will result from the mines in its neighbourhood, are all taken into consideration, the mind instinctively looks forward to this town as one ofthe first consequence in the United States ; probably as the future capital of the great- est country that ever the world saw. Distant 981 miles from Washington ; 758 from Pittsburgh ; 440 from Lexing- ton, Kentucky ; 470 from Knoxville, Tennessee ; 948 (by land) from New Orleans ; 1,418 from the source of the Mississippi ; and 3,557 from the Pacific ocean.* St. Louis district has the Mississippi river east, Mis- souri north-west, and the Merrimack ou the south. The country around and west of the town is for fifteen miles one extended prairie, of a very luxuriant soil, and in a high state of cultivation. There is a ferry from St. Louis to the Illinois side of the Mississippi ; from hence passes the main road to Kaskaskia. Lead and salt are the prin- cipal staples, and those articles are seut wherever a mar ket offers; but principally at New Orleans. The lands in the entire district of St. Louis are more fertile, and less broken, than those of St. Genevieve. Be- tween the Merrimack and the town of St. Louis, the banks \u2022 The distance from St. Louis to the Pacific ocean, in a direct tine, is onlv 1,861 miles."], [705, "MISSOURI TERRITORY. 683 of the Mississippi are high and rocky ; a short distance above St. Louis an alluvial bottom commences, which ex tends above the mouth of the Missouri. Upon both rivers the bottoms are extensive, with a level and fertile soil, covered with large timber. Prairies are very large near both St. Louis aud St. Ferdinand ; that near the latter is twelve miles long and two wide : extensive settlements are made upon its border. It lies nearly parallel to the Mis souri, and from one to two miles from that stream ; the settlements made upon this prairie are similar to those formed in like places in other parts of the territory : the plantations are extended into both the prairie and wood land, embracing a due proportion of each. The farms are many of them large and well cultivated, and their pro prietors wealthy. The settlements are every where ex tending ; the fertility ofthe lands, and the health enjoyed by the inhabitants, contribute to give unusual prosperity to the country near St. Louis. The richness and variety of its mineral and vegetable productions ; its lead, salt, flour, beef, pork, flax, and hemp, afford inexhaustible sources of wealth, and secures to this country a rank among the most eligible spots in the United States. The population of this district, in 1804, amounted to about 2,800 persons ; by the census of 1810, the inhabit ants were 5,667. The population at the commencement of 1819, exceeded 13,000 souls. Attached to St. Louis, is the flourishing settlement of St. Andrew's, twenty-five miles south-west of that town. Like all other parts of the district, the lands of St. Andrew's exhibit a mixture of prairie and woodland ; hill, dale, and soil, every where fertile : the farms are large, and skilfully conducted. Carondelet is situated on the bank of the Mississippi, six miles west of St. Louis, in the direction ofthe mines: it is an inconsiderable place, but like every other village in this country, is upon the increase. St. Ferdinand stands upon a rising ground near a fine brook of clear water, fourteen miles north-west of St. Louis. The^lands adjacent, particularly the prairies, are ex tremely fertile. Viltepuche, a French village of sixty or seventy houses, is situated on the margin of the Mississippi, nineteen mites below St. Louis, and just below the mouth of Bigolua creek. Herculaneum stands near the Mississippi, thirty mites below St. Louis. It is settled by Americans, and has a fine manufactory of shot, with a fall of 200 feet perpendicular. 4 s"], [706, "684 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. The lead mines are about forty-five miles due wes from this place. St. Genevieve is situated on the second bank of the Mississippi, about oue mile from the river, and twenty one miles below Herculaneum, in lat. 37\u00b0 51'. N. It was commenced about the year 1774, and is at present the principal depot for most of the mines on the waters ofthe Merrimack, and the store-house from wheuce are drawn the supplies of the miners. Its site is a handsome plain of 100 acres ; the little river Gouberie, the two branches of which form a junction between the town and the river, water it ou its upper and lower margins. In front of the town there is a fine bottom, extending from the mouth of the Gouberie, eight or nine miles aloug the Mississippi, and the greater part of the distance three miles wide. The common field, enclosed and cultivated by the citi zens, contains about 7,000 acres. The surrounding coun try is broken, but yields good crops. The town contains about 350 houses, an academy, and eight or ten stores. A road runs from this town to the lead mines, and the greater part of the inhabitants have an interest in, or are employed in some way, in the lead trade. The district of St. Genevieve is bounded south-east by Apple creek, sixty-four miles, north by Merrimack river, fifty-seven miles, north-east by the Mississippi ; upon the latter it extends upwards of 100 miles : to the west its boundaries are unlimited. The land is various, and more hilly than that of Cape Girardeau, perhaps it is also less fertile ; but certainly richer in mineral wealth, particularly in lead and salt: the settlements extend to the river St. Francis, whose lead streams rise in this district. Between St. Genevieve and the Merrimack, the banks of the Missis sippi are in many places of great elevation, and composed of rock. Some ofthe bluffs rise at least 360 feet, aud have at a distance the appearance of artificial towers : they are solid masses of limestone disposed in horizontal layers. The population of Genevieve district, in 1804, amount ed to 2,870; in 1810, to 4,820; it is now more than double the latter number, and increasing with great rapidity. New Bourbon is situated on a bluff, two miles lower down the river, and contains about seventy buildings. The inhabitants are mostly French, and are a lively and hospitable people. Cape Girardeau stands on an eminence thirty-eight miles above the mouth of the Ohio, and seventy-six be low St. Genevieve; it is settled by Germans and a few French, The country to the west of the village is uneven,"], [707, "685 MISSOURI TERRITORY. but of a good soil for several miles : the bottoms are deep, and capable of producing the greatest crops of corn, cot ton, and tobacco. This is one of the most flourishing settlements on the western waters of tbe United States. The lands are various and good ; the principal staples are cotton, flour, tobacco, hemp, and maple sugar: Indian corn is raised for home consumption, but is frequently exported to Natchez and New Orleans. Beef, pork, lard, and tallow, are also produced for consumption and exportation. The settle- ments in this district are so far from being confined to the banks of the Mississippi, that the greatest number are scattered west of Cape Girardeau, and even extend to the waters of St. Francis, sixty miles in the rear of the cape, where the lands are of the first quality. The district of Cape Girardeau extends from Apple creek to Tawapaty bottom, about thirty miles. The first establishment of the settlement was in 1794 ; in 1803, the population amounted to 1,206; by the census of 1810 it had increased to 3,888, and in 1818, the number of inha- bitants was upwards of 8,000. New Madrid is situated on the west bank ofthe Missis- sippi, eighty-one miles below the mouth of the Ohio. This town was founded in .1787, and was intended to be- come a great commercial city, and the emporium of the vast tract of fertile country watered by the Mississippi, the Missouri, and their branches. It was indeed happily situated for the purpose ; but the river has swept away the ground on which it was originally placed, and the earth- quakes of 1812 have sunk the remainder of the bluff be- low high-water mark. It is impossible to visit this spot, knowing any thing of its history, and not be struck with the air of desolation it now breathes. There was a fine lake in the rear ofthe town, on the banks of which public walks and plantations of trees were planned for the ac- commodation of its inhabitants: this is now a heap of sand! \u2014 There are about half a dozen houses on the grouud, and the earthquakes are still frequent: on the 17th of August, 1818, several severe shocks occurred; and the river is constantly making encroachments upon the banks in front of the place. The town of Little Prairie, thirty mites below New Madrid, also suffered by the earthquakes of 1812; pre vious to that time there were about 200 souls in the vil lage : it is now fast approaching to decay. The last settlement of note in the Missouri territory., advancing towards the state of Louisiana, is at and near"], [708, "686 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. the Hot Springs on Ouachitta. This place was uninhabit ed until about 1805, when a few settlers established them selves upon the Ouachitta and the waters of Little Mis souri. The emigration to this remote spot has continued annually since the sorementioned period ; some families have advanced to the Red river ; the whole number must now exceed oue thousand. Between the new settlements on Ouachitta and the an- cient French post on Arkansaw, a mountainous and bar- ren wilderness intervenes. The post or town of Arkansaw is above forty-five miles above the entrance of that stream into the Mississippi. This is one of the most ancient establishments in Louisiana, being formed before the beginniug of the last century ; but its advauce has not been in proportion to its duration. It has remained poor and inconsiderable, like all other places where the inhabit- ants depend upon hunting, and trade with savages for their subsistence and commerce : the settlers are mostly French, many of them of mixed blood with the Indians. Much of the land adjacent to the settlement is fertile, but too flat, and consequently liable to inundation. Proceed- ing westward of the Arkansaw, the wood and fertile soil gradually decline, and are succeeded by the boundless barren prairies upon the Arkansaw, Kanzas, and Platte rivers. It has been already observed, that the country included between the White, St. Francis, and Mississippi rivers is generally low and annually inundated : the banks of the streams are the most elevated parts, but are them- selves liable to inundation. The rivers interlock in a thousand mazes, aud in every respect present a similar picture with the overflowed country west of the Missis- sippi, in the state of Louisiana. Wherever the land is above, or can be defended from high water, it possesses the character common to alluvion ; is a deep fertile loam, clothed with trees of the largest growth. The settle ments yet made on St. Francis river, are very inconsider- able ; upon the Mississippi the land is higher, and com mercial facility greater than in the interior ; of course it is there that the most extensive establishments have been formed. The Missouri territory, taken as a whole, as yet con tains but very few white settlers ; although, for the most part, the soil is excellent, and the climate charming. There is no part of the western world that holds out great er advantages to the industrious emigrant than this fine and healthy country. In an agricultural point of view, the vast tract of prairies, extending throughout all these"], [709, "MISSOURI TERRITORY. 687 regions, is an important object of consideration In the first place, the soil is excellent, and, in a state of nature, it is covered with the finest verdure imaginable. The stratum immediately below the vegetable soil is almost universally a very tenacious clay, and extremely well calculated to form a material for brick, or, in the first in stance, for such habitations as are made in Ireland and Scotland, many of which are very comfortable. This is an important object in a country destitute of trees; though in time plenty of timber could be raised ; for to suppose it would not grow there because it does not, would be perfectly absurd. Whenever this country shall begin to be peopled, the first settlements will be made at the edge of the woody region, or on the borders of the rivers, where a little timber may be found, and probably the first wave in the tide of population will be formed of shepherds and herdsmen. The tacit compact mutually binding betwixt man and the animals he domesticates, implies a duty connected with an interest to both parties. Man furnishes to them food and protection, and enables them to pass a few years of comfortable existence : they repay him with their lives or their services. In all cases, the domestication of animals is of the most value to man in those parts where he can perform his duty to them at the least expense to himself. In no part of the world can it be done with less trouble than in the southern part of this grassy region. A convincing proof of this is, that here domesticated animals have dissolved the contract, and that thousands and tens of thousands of their descendants still maintain their independence. Amongst the Americans, the question of \" Whether these boundless prairies can or cannot be peopled by civi lized man?\" has often been agitated Accustomed, as these people are, to a profusion of timber, for buildings, fuel, and fences, they are not aware of the small quantity of that article which may be necessary, in a country abounding in another substance much better adapted sor fuel ; nor can they conceive that fences, and even build ings, may be constructed with the application of a very small portion of timber. Under these impressions, the belief in America is, that the prairies cannot be inhabited by white men : and one of their best writers asserts that it cannot be cultivated.,. But the decided opinion of the best informed Europeans is, that it can be cultivated ; and that, in process of time, it will not only be thickly in habited, but that it will be one of the most beautiful countries in the world."], [710, "688 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. There are no less than forty-two tribes or nations of Indians dispersed over the Missouri territory ; the prin cipal of whom are the Sioux, the Kiawas, the Osages, and the Pawnees. Many of those tribes are fierce and warlike, particularly the Sioux, who are the terror of all the sur rounding nations ; their number amounts to 21,675, in cluding 3,835 fighting men, in general well armed. Against the Osages and their allies, a considerable detach ment of United States troops has lately proceeded up the Missouri in steam boats, as far as Yellow Stone river ; a distance of 1,882 miles above St. Louis. The Osage Indians are remarkably tall, large, and ferocious, erect and well proportioned ; their number exceeds 10,400, comprising 2,500 warriors. \u2014 The total number of Indians, in all the tribes, has been estimated at 103,025, of whom 30,920 are warriors. MICHIGAN TERRITORY, Situation, Boundaries, and Extent. This territory is situated between 41\u00b0 45' and 45\" 35' N. lat., and 5\u00b0 5' and 8\u00b0 18* W. long. Its boundaries, as esta blished by law, are, a due north line from the southern most point of lake Michigan, thence south-east by the divisional line which separates the British possessions in Upper Canada, passing through lakes Huron and St. Clair to lake Erie ; and south, by a due east and west line, which divides it from the states of Ohio and Indiana. \u2014 Extent from north to south 234 miles ; breadth from east to west 138 miles ; forming an area of 27,000 square miles, or 17,280,000 acres. Rivers, bays, lakes, and islands. \u2014 The rivers are nume rous, and mostly navigable for boats and canoes, nearly to their heads. Grand river, the largest tributary of lake Michigan, rises in lakes and ponds in the south-east cor ner of the territory, interweaves its branches with those of Raisin, Black river, Mastigan, and Saganum, and falls into the lake about twenty miles north of Raisin. This river is described as running through a country consist\""], [711, "MICHIGAN TERRITORY. 689 ing alternately of woodlands and prairies, abounding with most kinds of wild game. It is navigable for small craft to its source ; in high water boats of a considerable size pass from lake Michigan into lake Erie through this aud Huron river. A canal connecting Grand river with the Saganum, running iuto lake Huron, could be opened at a small expense. This canal is among the number recom, mended by judge Woodward, of Detroit, iu his able report on the subject of internal navigation. The other streams which run into lake Michigan are, the St. Joseph's, which heads iu the state of Indiana, and interlocks by its several branches with Black river, St. Joseph's-of-Miami, Eel river, and Tippacanoe: it enters the south-east end of the lake, is rapid and full of shoals, but navigable 150 miles, and is 200 yards wide at its mouth. The Pottowatomy Indians, who reside on the shore, catch prodigious quantities of fish in its waters: it runs about forty miles in the Michigan territory. On the north bank of this river stands the old fort St. Josephs, from which there is a bridle road to Detroit. Black river, Marame, Barbue, Raisin, Mastigan, White, Rocky, and Beauvuis ; the last three are short rivers, run ning a westerly course, and emptying themselves into the lake in the order named, at the distance of from ten to fifteen miles apart. St. Nicholas, Marguerite, Monistic, Aux Sables, Lassiette, and Grand Traverse ; the four last are small streams, which enter the lake between Mar guerite and the straits of Michilimackinac. The greater part of the rivers just mentioned, expand and form circular bays or small lakes behind the sand-hills near the lake. This effect is produced by the frequent conflicts between the currents of the rivers and the surf of the lake ; for the latter not only repels, as it were, the tributary streams, but at the same time washes the sand of the shore into their mouths, causing the smaller ones to contract at their entrance into mere brooks. These basins are from two to three miles across, and are, at cer- tain seasons, literally covered with wild ducks, geese, and ether water fowl, which resort here to feed on the wild rice, profusely sown by the hand of nature. \u2014 The pious and benevolent St. Pierre could have found in these bays materials for an eloquent chapter on the beneficence ofthe Deity. The rivers which fall into lake Huron between Michili mackinac and the straits of St. Clair, have a northern or north-western direction. Saganum river, which is next in size to Grand river, and"], [712, "690 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. with which it interlocks, heads near the centre of the territory. The land on its banks is of good quality, and sufficiently extensive to form, at some future day, rich and extensive settlements : it enters the bay of the same name. The Chippewa Indians have several villages on this river, and there are two salines running into it, which it is believed will be able, when properly worked, to supply not only the territory, but all the settlements on the upper lakes, with salt. Sugar river, and several considerable creeks, run into the lake between Saganum and the strait of St. Clair : at the upper end of this strait, on the Ameri can side, stands fort Gratiot, built by captain Gratiot in the summer of 1815. Thunder river falls into the bay of the same name, about halfway between Michilimackinac aud the outlet of lake Huron. Chagahagun river enters the lake about thirty-five miles east of Michilimakinae. Sandy river runs into Saganum bay. The straits of St. Clair are twenty-six miles long. The land on both sides is partly prairie, interspersed with strips of lofty woodland, consisting of oak, sugar-maple, poplar, black walnut, hickory and white pine. Nature has here planted groves of the latter timber, suitable for masts, boards, and shingles ; wbich is much increased in value by the scarcity of this excellent wood, since it can be transported to distant parts, destitute of so very useful a material. In the strait are several valuable islands, and there is water sufficient for a twenty-gun ship. The rivers and creeks running into St. Clair from the American ter ritory are, Belle river, which heads near the Saganum, and enters the lake nine miles below the strait. There are good situations for settlements, and some pine groves upon this river: about fourteen miles further down the lake is the river. On the banks of this stream is found some of the best land in the territory ; and here is a con siderable French settlement, which was commenced more than twenty years ago. A little above the mouth of this river, the Indians have a reservation of three miles square, on which is Machonee's village. The white settlements on this river are rapidly increasing, by reason of nume rous emigrants from Oxford township, and other places on the river Thames, in Upper Canada ; who are disgusted at the colonial administration of the British government. Several mills have been lately erected, and the lands are rising in value. The bottoms of Huron are wide and rich, principally timbered by sycamore, hickory, elm, and"], [713, "MICHIGAN TERRITORY. 691 maple ; on the upland, oak, ash, hickory, and there are considerable quantities of white pine. The strait of Detroit, connecting lakes Erie and St. Clair, is twenty-four miles long, and, like the strait or river St. Clair, navigable for large vessels, and studded with islands : it is about half a mile wide, with a current running nearly three miles an hour. This strait receives the rivers Rouge, Ecorce, and Maguago,and Brownstown creeks. The river Rouge rises about forty miles south-west of Detroit, near the head branches of Huron ; it enters the strait five miles below Detroit, expands to the width of 600 yards at its mouth, forming a considerable bay, and is navigable five miles upwards for vessels of 150 tons ; and for canoes and light boats thirty-five miles. Ten or twelve miles from the strait commence wide and fertile black walnut and sycamore bottoms. The corn, wheat, and potatoes raised on the banks of this river, yield as abundantly as the best soils in the state of Ohio. These lands belong to the United States, with the exception of four sections, one mile square each, and can be purchased at two dollars an acre. The river Ecorce falls into the strait three miles below the mouth of Rouge, and is remarkable for nothing but the vast quantities of wild rice growing in its waters. Maguago and Brownstown creeks are unimportant streams, and, like the rivers Rouge and Ecorce, afford no situa tions for mills or water machinery. Huron river enters the lake about seven miles south of Maiden ; it rises near the principal source of Grand river, between which and it, there is said to be a navigable com munication for canoes through a chain of ponds and marshes. Before reaching the open lake, it winds two or three miles through a vast meadow of wild rice, in which the water is from five to seven feet deep. Six miles south of Huron, Swan creek, or river Aux Cignes, falls into the lake ; its banks for some distance from its mouth are low, but the meadow or prairie is capa ble of cultivation. A few French families are the only human beings that have had the courage to brave disease and rattlesnakes. Their wheat, Indian corn, pumpkins, and garden produce thrive well ; indeed there is very little of the meadow but what might be ploughed : corn, flax, and hemp would do best. The pond lily, wild rice, and other aquatic plants almost choke up the channel of the river, gi\\ ing the water an offensive and putrid smell ; in summer it will rope like treacle, yet the inhabitants 4 T"], [714, "692 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. make a free use of it for cooking and drinking. Why it does not produce almost instant death, it is impossible to conceive ; the children near the lake look miserably. The timbered land here approaches withiu a mile of the lake ; four miles from which this stream has a brisk current, and affords situations favourable to mill-seats, or rather water-machinery : the trees are lofty, the land high and arable. Three miles further south is Rocky creek, and two miles still more southerly Sandy creek falls into the lake, which here forms a considerable bay. A few French families are settled on the banks of these streams, where the soil is good ; but that of the uplands is sandy. Seven miles south of Sandy creek, following the road, but not half the distance by the lake coast, enters the river Raisin, so called from the vast quantities of grapes that are found upon its banks. It interlocks with the St. Joseph-of-Miami, and Black river, running into lake Michigan, and rises in swamps and small lakes; fifteen miles from its mouth it receives the river Macon. The Raisin is about forty-five yards wide, and boatable to with in a few miles of a branch of Black river : there is an ex tensive prairie at its mouth, and several hundred acres of wild rice. The settlements extend from within two miles of the lake to the mouth of the river Macon ; the lots are surveyed in the French mode, being only three Paris arpents* wide on the river, and extending back far enough to contain 100 arpents, or acres, more or less. The in habitants are mostly French, who raise wheat, Indian corn, and potatoes, more than sufficient for their own con sumption ; the soil proves to be rich and durable, and the settlements have been blessed with unusual good health. The bottoms are equal to those of the Miami ; but the soil of the upland is in many places light and sandy : there are several grist and saw mills on the rivers. The coun try has been settled about thirty years, and the orchards already yield an abundance of apples ; cider and peach brandy are made for exportation. The French settlers, until very lately, did not set a proper value on their improvements ; but would often dispose of them for comparatively a trifling sum. From the river Raisin lo the mouth ofthe Miami is eighteen miles ; the first stream is Otter creek, four mites from Raisin : it affords several situations for mills, upon which there are already a num ber erected. Wapoo creek flows into the lake about two * One hundred French arpents make 84| American acres."], [715, "693 MICHIGAN TERRITORY. miles north of Miami bay. Swan creek, which rises near the head of Otter creek, falls into the Miami four miles from its mouth ; this is a brisk stream abounding with mill-seats. The Miami has been noticed in the descrip- tion of the state of Ohio, and in page 114. The most considerable bays on the east side of lake Michigan, are those of Sable and Grand Traverse; the last is about twelve miles deep, and four or five broad. Those on the Huron coast are Thunder and Saganum bays ; the former has its uamefrom the thunder frequently heard there, and is about nine miles across either way : the latter is forty miles long, and from eight to twelve wide. The interior of Michigan peninsula contains a great number of small lakes and ponds, from half a mile to twelve miles in length, from which issue many ofthe rivers. The strait connecting lakes Huron and Michigau is fifteen mites long, of an oval figure, and subject to a flux and reflux: lake Michigan has been described in page 30. The island of Michilimackinac is important in a political point of view, being the Gibraltar ofthe north- west. It is of an elliptical form, about seven miles in cir- cumference, rising gradually to the centre : its figure suggested to the mind of the Indians its appropriate name, Michi Mackina* (Great Turtle.) The greater part of the island is almost an impenetrable thicket of underwood and small trees, which contribute materially to the de- fence of the garrison. Fort Holmes stands on a summit of the island, several hundred feet above the level of lake Huron, and is now one of the most formidable posi tions in the western country. The French were the first settlers, and their descendants, to the number of about 300, reside near the fort. Maniton island is situated near the eastern coast of lake Michigan ; it is six miles long and four wide, and is held sacred by the Indians. The Castor islands are a chain of islets, extending from Grand Traverse bay nearly across the lake ; they are low and sandy, but afford a shelter for light boats in their pas sage to Green bay. Grosse Isle is a valuable alluvion of several thousand acres, being five miles long, and from one to two wide. \u2022 The Indian tradition concerning the name of this little barren island is curious. \u2014They say that Michapous, the chief of spirits, sojourned long in that neighbour hood ; and they believe that a mountain on the border of the lake was the place of his residence, which they still call by his name. It was here, say they, that he first instructed men to make nets for fishing, and where he has collected the greatest quantity of fish. On the island he left spirits named Imakinakos, and from thes* tpnul possessors it has received the appellation oi Mi\u00ablulir_ac!;m\u00bb\u00bb."], [716, "694 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. Surface, soil, timber, settlements, &c. \u2014 There are ho mountains iu this territory ; but in the centre there is high table land, having a western and northern inclination, interspersed with small lakes and marshes, from which issue the head branches ofthe rivers. Prairies exist, from the banks of the St. Joseph's to lake St. Clair ; some are of an excellent soil ; others, sandy, wet, and sterile. There are, nevertheless, extensive forests of lofty timber, consisting of oak, sugar-maple, beech, ash, poplar, white and yellow pine, hickory, cedar, plum, and black and honey locust. The last flourishes as far north as the margin of lake Huron; yet east ofthe Allegany moun tains, it is never found north of the Delaware. The bot toms and high prairies are equal to those in the state of Indiana ; but although the soil is pretty fertile through out the territory, it is only cultivated in the neighbour hood of lakes and rivers. A considerable part of the coast of lake Michigan consists of a range of sand hills, thrown up by the surf and eddying winds. The timbered uplands are well adapted to the production of most kinds of grain, and appear to bear a long series of crops. The white settlements are chiefly on the strait of Detroit, the rivers Miami, Raisin, Huron, and Jake St. Clair; but extend from fort Meigs to lake Huron, sepa rated, however, at short intervals, by woods, or Indian reservations of from three to ten miles in extent. Where the French inhabitants are seated, the lots are narrow, houses thick, only one plantation deep ; always fronting the creeks, rivers, and lakes. Hitherto, this territory has not enjoyed the character to which its soil, climate'and advantageous situation for trade, justly entitle it. Time, and the enterprising emigrants, who are now rapidly in creasing in numbers, will place its reputation in a proper point of view. Settlements are now beginning on lakes Huron and Michigan, and promise to become extensive and permanent. A military officer who passed from Michilimackinac to Bethcoit; a distance of 450 miles, in the spring of 1817, describes the lands on Saganum river as of an excellent quality, and most beautifully situated ; the river bold and navigable for twenty-one miles, with large prairies from four to six miles deep. From Saganum to Flint river, fifteen miles, a level country, lands excellent and well timbered ; from thence to the river Huron, thirty miles trom Detroit, a very open country, principally clothed with oak, and no underwood ; interspersed with small beautiful lakes, abounding in fish of a superior quality :"], [717, "695 MICHIGAN TERRITORY. from Huronjo Detroit, generally a low flat country, sus ceptible of being drained and cultivated, the soil deep and rich. From the river Rouge to lake St. Clair, distant twelve miles, the country resembles the suburbs ofa large town, the houses being no more than twenty rods distant from each other, and the greater part of the way much closer. A road has lately been opened from the river Ecorce to the rapids ofthe Miami, a distance of sixty miles. Upon this road may be found many eligible situations for farms, and stauds for taverns ; and no where north of the cotfon and sugar climate, could agriculturalists find a finer field for enterprise, or a surer prospect of reward. There is no state or territory in North America so boun tifully supplied with fish, water-fowls, and wild game. All the rivers from the Miami-of-the-lakes to the St. Josephs of lake Michigan, afford an inexhaustible supply of fish ; to say nothing of the vast lakes which wash 600 miles of its frontier. The trout of Miehilimackinac have a superior relish, and unlike most kinds of fish, never cloy the appetite by use ; they weigh from ten to seventy pounds, and are taken at all seasons. White fish are caught in prodigious numbers with nets, in the strait of Detroit and lake St. Clair; and there are situations where a person, with a hook or spear, may soon catch as many as he can carry. Sturgeon are common to lakes Erie, St. Clair, Huron, and Michigan. Myriads of ducks and wild geese frequent the rivers, bays, and lakes, and can be easily shot ; for their fears seem to be drowned in the constant din of vociferous quakings, and in the incessant thunder of their wings. Wild turkeys, quails, grouse, pigeons, and hawks, are numerous ; the latter are, perbaps, the most common land bird, the black bird excepted, which in autumn appear in swarms, and are injurious to corn and new sown wheat. Wild game is plentiful ; bears, wolves, elk, deer, foxes, beaver, otter, muskrats, marten, rackoon, wild cats, rabbits, and squirrels, are found in the forests: the beaver fre quents the rivers running into lake Michigan. Civil divisions, chief town, population, climate, dis eases, &c\u2014 This territory is divided into four districts, which, by the census in 1800, contained 3,206 inhabitants; in 1810 they bad increased to 4,762 ; being no more than 1,556 in ten years. There is no means of determining with accuracy the present population; but it probably"], [718, "696 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. exceeds 12,000, exclusive of Indians. The settlement of this country will uot of course, advance rapidly, until many of the new states in the western country are silled up ; but such are its natural advantages, that it must attract notice, and ultimately have a station of consider able importance in the Union. \u2014 The following statement will show the relative numbers of inhabifants in the diffe- rent districts in 1810. Districts. Population, Chief Town and Population. Detroit 2,227 Detroit, 770 Erie 1,340 Huron 580 Michilimaokinac 615 4,762, including twenty-four slaves. The town of Detroit is situated on the western side of the strait of St. Clair, or Detroit river, between lakes Erie and St. Clair, eighteen miles above Maiden, on the Canada side of the river. The situation of the town is agreeable and romantic ; the buildings approach close to the river bank, which is above twenty feet high, abrupt at the lower end of the town, but subsides into a gentle slope near the upper limits, where the plain on which it stands becomes about 500 yards wide. There are three streets running parallel with the river, and these are intersected by six cross streets, besides several lanes. The buildings are of brick, stone, frame, and, in some instances, hewn logs : but two-thirds are frame, some of which are very fine and painted. There are about 350 buildings of all descriptions, exclusive of the suburbs, extending above as far as lake St. Clair, and below as far as the river Rouge, which appear to be a continuation of the town : the principal streets are wide, and most of the houses have picketed gardens in the rear. The inha bitants are more than half of French extraction ; the re mainder consists of emigrants and adventurers from various parts of Europe and America. The public buildings consist of the council-house, a large Roman catholic chapel, a jail, and a government storehouse ; a fine brick building has been lately erected for a state-house. Detroit is a place of very considerable trade ; several wooden wharfs project into the river, one of which is 140 feet long, and a vessel of 400 tons burden can approach its head. The stores and shops in the town are well furnished, and you may buy fine cloth, linen, every article of wearing apparel, as good in their"], [719, "MICHIGAN TERRITORY. 697 kind, and Dearly as cheap, as at New York or Philadelphia. The inhabitants are plentifully supplied with provisions of every description ;\u25a0 the fish iu particular, caught in the river and neighbouring lakes, are of a very superior quality, and in great abundance. There is a printing office here, in which French religious books are printed in a rude style ; a weekly newspaper is also published : learning is at a low ebb, though there are many men of education and genius resident in the plaee. The streets of Detroit are geuerally crowded with Indians of one tribe or other, who collect here fo sell their skins ; at night, all those who are not admitted into private houses, and re main there quietly, are turned out of the town, and the gates shut upon them. The French inhabitants employed upon the lakes and rivers are very dexterous watermen ; and will navigate a small bark in a rough sea with in credible skill. TheyT have nothing like enterprize in business, and are very fond of music, dancing, aud smoak ing tobacco : the women have generally lively and ex pressive countenances. The fort stands on a low ridge, in the rear ofthe town, at the distance of about 200 yards. From the summit of this ridge, the country gradually subsides to a low swampy plain, from five fo nine miles across, covered with thick groves of young timber. Beyond this plain commences a surface moderately hilly, and a soil more congenial to the growth of grain fruit, if not grass. The inhabitants have to draw their wood a mile and a half, from the United States lands in the rear ofthe town ; it sells in market for three dollars a chord. Almost every farm has an orchard, in which apples, pears, and peaches thrive well ; several hundred barrels of cider are annually made, which sells at a high price. There is very little settlement on the west part of lake Huron, or on the east part of lake Michigan. All the Indian lands from the Miami of lake Erie nearly to Saga num bay, including those between that distance on lake Erie, the river Detroit, lake St. Clair, the river St. Clair, and lake Huron, and extending back to the westward about eighty mites, have been purchased by the United States. There is supposed to be included within this tract about 7,000,000 of acres, watered by the rivers Miami, Raisin, Huron, Rouge, Huron of lake St. Clair, Trent, and some branches of the Saganum. The lands on all those rivers are fertile, and capable of abundant produc tions ; the country is generally level, and easy to be cultivated."], [720, "698 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. The diseases of this territory are chiefly fevers, agues, jaundice, and dysentery; the last often fatal to children : consumption is unfrequent. \u2014 The mortal epidemic disease of the winter 1813, traversed this country like a destroy ing angel, and swept off above 100 white men, besides many Indians. The climate ofthe eastern part ofthe territory is nearly similar to that of the western counties of New York and Pennsylvania ; towards the state of Indiana it is milder, but upon the coast of lakes Huron and St. Clair it is more severe, and winter approaches at least two weeks earlier than at Detroit ; lake St. Clair is frozen over every year from December to February. The Indians residing in this territory have been esti mated at 3,000 souls ; but this number has doubtless been considerably diminished by the battles which they fought, and the uncommon sufferings which they endured during the late war. Their trade is very valuable to their white neighbours. They all cultivate Indian corn, and some of them wheat, as well as most kinds of garden vegetables and fruit ; raise horses, cattle, hogs, and poultry ; but never theless derive a principal part of their subsistence from the waters and forests. NORTH-WEST TERRITORY. Situation, Boundaries, and Extent. This territory is situated between 41\u00b0 45' and 49\u00b0 37' N. lat. and 7\u00b0 and 18\u00b0 50' W. long. It is bounded on the north by Upper Canada and lake Superior ; south, by the states of Indiana and Illinois ; east, by Upper Canada and lake Michigan ; and west and south-west, by the Missis sippi river, which divides it from the Missouri territory. Its extent from north to south is about 360 miles, and from east to west 456 miles ; comprising nearly 147,000 square miles, or 94,080,000 acres.\u2014 This extensive coun try has not yet been organized into a regular government; but it is advancing rapidly into importance. Part of the United States troops are stationed at the village of Prairie du Chiens, near the confluence ofthe Ouisconsin with tbe Mississippi, and along the Ouisconsin and Fox rivers,"], [721, "NORTH-WEST TERRITORY. 699 who will check and coutroul the Indians in that quarter ; and, judging from the value of the country, and the great tide of emigration to the westward, we may conclude that the basis of a society will soon be formed, requiring the usual forms of government established in the other terri tories. No settlements of consequence, however, have yet been made, and the sew inhabitants were not included in the last census. Rivers. \u2014 The rivers of this territory have three different directions ; a part running northwardly into lake Supe rior; others westwardly into the Mississippi; and some eastwardly into lake Michigan and the river Illinois, Fox river rises.in the high lands on the north-eastern corner of the territory, near the Ouisconsin, and runs parallel with that river for fifty miles, at one place ap proaching within three miles of it. From thence it pur sues a north-east course, aud passing through Winnebago lake, falls into Green bay, a branch of lake Michigan. Plein river, or Des Planes, described in page 572, enters the Illinois fifty-five miles south of the Chicago portage. This stream has four or five short rapids, that appear only in times of low water ; in every other part it has the ap pearance of being a chain of stagnant pools and small lakes, affording a sufficient depth of water for boats of moderate draught. The Depage rises a few miles west ofthe Plein, which it closely resembles in the heigh of its bluffs, width of its valley, soil and timber ; it enters the Illinois seventy miles above the mouth of Plein. Chicago river is merely an arm of the lake of that name, dividing itself into two branches, at the distance ofa mile inland from its communication with the lake. The en trance of this river into lake Michigan is obstructed by a sand-bar, which could easily be removed, so as to admit vessels of any burden into the river ; aud the water-course which is already opened between tbe Chicago and Plein, needs but little more excavation to answer all the pur poses of a canal ; and to render the Plein and Illinois navigable for boats and flats, nothing is necessary but the construction of sluices wide enough to admit the boats to pass through them. Thus a water communication between the Illinois and lake Michigan may be kept open at all times, sufficient to answer every purpose for which a canal will be wanted for many years to come. Between Chicago and Green bay the following river . aro. xxx. 4 u"], [722, "700 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. enter into lake Michigan from the west, iu the order named, viz. Tanahan, Wakayah, Masquedou, Cedar, Roar ing, Milwakee,Saukie,Skabayagau, Maurice, and Fourche. The streams have ail an eastern course, running generally parallel with each other at the distance of from ten fo twenty miles, and heading from thirty to sixty miles from the lake. \u2014 Roaring river is so called from a rumbling noise, like distant thunder, which is heard every two or three days during the warm season ; occasioned, it is thought, by the vast quantities of copper, which attract the electric fluid to that place. The Indians, in conse quence approach this river with religious awe, as being the residence ofthe Great Spirit. Greeu bay, is about 120 miles in length, and from six to thirty wide ; extending north and south parallel with lake Michigan, with which it is connected, at the distance of from twenty to thirty miles. It receives several rivers, the principal of which is Fox river, already mentioned, which falls into the south end of the bay. North of Fox river, are the Rouge, Gaspard, Menomonie, and Sandy rivers, all falling into Green bay. Between the Detour, or entrance of the bay and Michili mackinac, are the rivers Manistique and Mino Cockieu ; the first falls into lake Michigan thirty miles north of the mouth of the bay. It is a large river, wbich takes its rise from an extensive lake, and nearly communicates with lake Superior : its banks are high and sandy, and abound with pine timber. The Mino Cockien is also a large and deep stream, heads near lake Superior, and flows into lake Michigan about thirty-five miles south-west of Michilimackiuac. The strait or river St. Mary, connecting lakes Superior and Huron, is about fifty miles in length, and is divided into several channels, which form a variety of islands; the largest of which is St. Josephs, seventy-five miles iu circumference. That part of the territory stretching along the southern borders of lake Superior, is well watered by about thirty rivers. The St. Louis falls into West bay, at Fond du Lac ; it is large and navigable 150 miles, and rises near the east ern head branches of the Mississippi. The north-west fur company have several trading houses established at its mouth, and on its banks towards its source. A prodigious number of streams pay their tribute to the Mississippi from the east, between its source and Rocky river, which discharges its waters in the Illinois territory. Le Croix and Deer rivers, the extent of whose navigation"], [723, "NORTH-WEST TERRITORY. 701 is yet unknown, and whose branches are interwoven with those of the St. Louis, enter the Mississippi below the forks of that river. Meadow river likewise falls into the Mississippi in N. lat. 46\u00b0 20', and is navigable for canoes ninety miles, to Swan lake. Sandy lake river, is forty miles below Swan river, aud connects the lake of the same name with the Mississippi. This lake is about twenty-five miles in circumference, and amongst a number of small rivers receives the Savannah, which by a portage of about four miles communicates with the afore-mentioned St. Louis, and is the channel by which the North-west com- pany convey their goods. Muddy river joins the Missis- sippi twenty miles below Sandy lake outlet; the next stream is Red Cedar river, issuing from a lake ofthe same name, and is nearly equidistant between the river De .Cor beau from the west and Sandy lake river. Between this and the falls of St. Anthony are Shrub oak, Lake, Clear, Elk, St. Francis, and Run rivers, all emptying from the east. St. Croix river joins the Missis sippi several mites below the falls of St. Anthony ; it is eighty yards wide at its mouth, 500 yards from which commences lake St. Croix, two or three miles wide and shirty-six long. This river communicates with Burnt wood river, by a portage of half a mite only, and in its whole extent has not one fall or rapid worthy of notice. This, with the mildness of its current, and its other ad vantages, render it by far the most preferable communi cation that can be had with lake Superior from the waters of the Mississippi. Chippeway river enters the Mississippi at the lower end of lake Pepin ; it is a deep, wide, majestic stream, inter locking with the Montreal, flowing into lake Superior, and with the Menomonie running into Green bay. \u2014 Its branches are numerous; the most considerable of which are Rufus, Yermillion and Copper rivers. Between lake Pepin and the Ouisconsin, the Buffalo, Black, and Prairie le Croix rivers enter the Missisippi from the east and north-east. Black river is atjout 200 yards wide, heads near Fox river of lake Michigan, and pur sues a course nearly parallel with the Ouisconsin. The Ousconsin joins the Mississippi at Prairie du. Chiens, 350 mites above the Missouri, where it is about half a mile wide. It rises east of the sources of Fox river, within fifty miles of lake Superior, and is the grand chan nel of communication between Prairie du Chiens and Michilimackinac. Rocky river takes ils source near Green bay of lake-"], [724, "702 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. Michigan, more than 450 miles from ils mouth, and is navigable upwards of 300 mites. It runs across the north west corner of the state of Illinois, and enters the Missis sippi 210 miles below Prairie du Chiens, and 390 above St. Louis. The interior ofthe North-west territory is watered by in numerable small lakes and ponds, from which issue the head branches of all the principal rivers. These lakes generally abound with wild rice,* water-fowls, and fish ; each in such prodigious quantities, that the Indians are in a manner exempted from the danger of famine. Face of the country, soil, productions, &c. \u2014 The sur face ofthe country is pretty similar to that ofthe territory last described. The dividing ridges between the Missis sippi and lake Superior, which in some maps are errone ously represented as mountains, are chiefly covered with forests of pine, spruce, and hemlock, giving to the coun try a cold and dreary aspect. Towards the shores of lake Superior the country improves in fertility and appearance, and affords, in some placss, rich bottom and upland, which, in process of time, will no doubt be thickly inha bited. From the Fond du Lac to Point Shagomigon, the banks of this immense lake are in general of strong clay, mixed with stones, which render the navigation irksome and dangerous. From this point or rather penin sula, to the outlet of the lake, the shore is almost one con tinued straight line of sandy beach, interspersed with rocky precipices of limestone, from twenty to 100 feet high, without a single bay, and but few good harbours. The timber along the coast is chiefly composed of oak, sugar-maple, and pine ; the bottoms have a deep and fer tile soil, but the uplands are sandy. The country on the southern shore of the strait St. Marie, which connects lake Superior and Huron, will admit of extensive settle ments; the eastern channel, called Miscoutinsaki, has a * This productive and highly valuable aquatic plant, is found in all the lakes', rivers, and bays of this territory ; the Indian tribe called by the French FoU Aeoines (wild rice eaters,) live almost entirely upon it. It grows in water of from four to seven feet depth, but always rejects a sandy bottom ; the plants extend from five to eight feet above the surface of the water, and are often so thick that they will wholly prevent the progress of canoes and boats. They are about the size of reed cj_nes, full of joints, and of the colour and texture of bulrushes ; the stalks above (he water, and the branches which bear the grain, resemble oats. When the heads become ripe, the Indians pass through them with their canoes lined with blankets, and bending the stalks over the sides, beat off the grain with sticks ; and- such is the abundance of the harvest, that an expert Indian or squaw will soob Sil a cange.\u2014 It is equally nutritious and palatable as the common rice."], [725, "NORTH-WEST TERRITORY. 703 rapid, well adapted for mill-seats. The lands on the south ern shore of the river of the same name, are excellent; prairies on its margin, and at a short distance back are groves of sugar-maple, in which the Chippeway Indians have numerous sugar-camps. From the Sault do Marie to this river is almost one continued meadow. The North west company's factory is at the soot of the rapids, on the British side ofthe strait. The whole establishment con sists of store-houses, a saw-mill, which supplies lumber for all their posts on lake Superior, a boat-yard, a stock ade, and a garden : nine miles above, at Pine Point, is a dock-yard for constructing vessels, where a ship-carpen ter resides, and several artificers are employed. The alluvial bottoms throughout this territory are in general as rich as those of Ohio and Michigan, as is proved by the excellence of the com crops at Green bay, Prairie du Chiens, and even on the banks of the Ontonagon, on the southern shore of lake Superior. The uplands and prairies south of the parallel of St. Anthony's falls, on the Mississippi, are generally good ; interspersed, however, with tracts of wet land, and rocky prairies, mixed .with extensive strips of light sandy soil, only suitable for the culture of barley and the smaller grains. High, bald \u25a0bills present themselves, in places, along the banks of Rocky river and the Ouisconsin. - From the falls of St. Anthony to the source of the Mississippi, there is a gradual deterioration of both soil and climate. The pine, or fir region, may be said to com mence at the falls; but there are some exceptions, where yon meet with small bottoms of oak, ash, maple, <fec. : the woods, however, are full of elk, deer, and buffalo, as far op as the river Corbeau, in N. lat. 45\u00b0 50'. From thence to Pine river, the shores ofthe Mississippi in general pre sent a dreary prospect of high, barren knobs, covered -with dead and fallen pine timber. From this there are occasional changes to ridges of yellow and pilch pine; also some small bottoms of elm, oak, and ash. The adjacent country is at least two-thirds covered with small dakes, some of which are three miles in circumference : this renders the communication impossible in summer, except with small bark canoes. Above Pine river there are but few situations fit for cultivation ; game scarce, and the country a succession of pine and hemlock ridges, with here and there a prairie, and small bottoms of elm, beech, and basswood Finally, from Leech lake upwards, to the extreme source of the Mississippi, the whole face of the country has the appearance of an impenetrable and boundless swamp."], [726, "704 U..ITED STATES OF AMERICA. Of the miuerals existing in this territory, lead, and copper appear to be the principal ; but iron ore, copperas, alum, and limestone are found along the shores of lakes Huron and Superior. The lead mines situated between the Ouisconsin and Rocky rivers, and approaching to within five or six miles of the Mississippi, extend above seventy miles in length, and about three in breadth. At present they yield from twenty to 40,000 lbs. of lead a year; and are deemed equally inexhaustible as those of the Merrimack, near St. Genevieve. Very specious accouuts have been published, respecting the abundance of the copper ore to be found in various parts of the territory. Captain Carver states, that he discovered several mines of virgin copper, on both sides of the St. Croix, which was as pure as that found in any other country. This writer was of opinion that this mineral would become an important article of commerce ; as the metal, which costs nothing on the spot, and requires but little expense to get it on board, could be conveyed in boats and ships to Quebec- \u2014 The cheapness and ease with which any quantity of it maybe procured, will make up for the length of way that is necessary to transport it, before it reaches the sea coast; and enable the proprietors to send it to foreign markets on as good terms as it cau be exported from other countries. On the banks, and in the neighbourhood of she Onto- nagon, which falls into lake Superior, Mr. Henry saw abundance of pure virgin copper, in masses of different dimensions : the Indians showed him one of twenty pounds weight. They were in the practice of manufac- turing this metal into spoons and bracelets for themselves; and from the perfect state in which they found it, it re- quired nothing but to beat it into shape. Upon a second visit to that river, accompanied by Indian guides, he dis covered a mass of copper, which, according to his estima tion, was no less than five tons weight, and so extremely malleable, that with an axe he cut off a portion weighing 100 pounds. On viewing the surrounding country, he conjectured that the mass had rolled from the side of an adjoining mountain. On the island of Nanibojou, upon the north-eastern coast of the lake, the same gentleman found several pieces of virgin copper ; some resembling the leaves of vegetables, and others of animals : their weight was from an ounce to three pounds. Captain Norburg, a Russian, in the British service, wa. employed to explore the borders of lake Superior, in quest of copper-mines. Having examined the coast of"], [727, "NORTH-WEST TERRITORY. 705 Nanibojou, and found several veins of copper and lead, he erected an air-furnace, and ascertained that the lead ore contained silver in the proportion of forty ounces to a ton ; but the copper ore in a very small proportion. Near Point aux Iroquois, on the south side of the lake, fifteen miles from the Sault St. Marie, he discovered a shod of eight pounds weight, of a blue colour, and semi transparent. This he carried to England, where it pro duced in the proportion of sixty pounds of silver to a hundred weight of ore. \u2014 It was deposited in the British Museum. Messrs. Henry and Norburg, accompanied by some other persons, afterwards repaired to the Ontonagon, where besides the detached masses of copper already mentioned, they saw much of the same metal bedded in stone ; aud iu digging, they frequently found pieces of pure copper, some of which were three pounds weight. \u2014 A green-coloured water issued from the hill, which tinged iron ofa copper colour. Mr. Mackenzie, the celebrated traveller, observes, that be should not be surprized to hear of the Americans em ploying people to work the copper mines. Indeed, he adds, that it might be well worthy the attention of British subjects to work the mines on the north coast; though they are not supposed to be so rich as those on the south. Near the mouth of Roaring river, masses of copper have been found, weighing from seven to twenty-five pounds ; and on Middle Island, near the western coast of lake Michigan, and not far distant from the above river, are found great quantities of pure copper. Upon the whole, if it really be true that copper ore exists on the shores of lake Superior, to the extent stated by Car ver, Henry, Norburg, and Mackenzie, to which may be added, the testimony of the late general Pike, and the present generals Hull and Wilkinson, the fact insures the future commercial consequence of this territory.* As the route from Michilimackiuac to Prairie du Chiens, by way of Green bay, Fox river, and the Ouisconsin, is much frequented by both American and British traders, and as it is yearly becoming more important, this account of the North-West territory shall be concluded by a de scription of the navigation, and of the country through which the above route passes. . The distance between Michilimackinac and the French settlement is about 175 miles. The western coast of lake \u2022 In November, IS16, a company was formed in the Uaitod States, for the pnrpoEe of opening mines in the above \"districts."], [728, "706 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. Michigan, from Michilimackinac to the entrance of Greeti bay, affords several good harbours, such as the islands of St. Helens, Eponvette, Mino Cockien river, Sou choir rock, and the Manistique : the entrance into Green bay will admit vessels of 200 tons burden. The best harbours ou the traverse of the bay, are the Petite Detroit, and Isle Roche, (the last is inaccessible to all winds,) Sturgeon bay, and the mouth of Rouge river ; nevertheless, the voyage is dangerous in boisterous weather, as the coast is in several places lined with rocks: the navigation of the bay is safe and easy, for large vessels. Fox river falls iuto the south-western extremity of the above lake ; it is about 400 yards wide, with three fathoms water at its mouth, and is navigable 160 miles to the portage. Half a mile from its mouth, commences a French settlement, extending the distance of five miles on both sides of the river, occupied by about fifty families, who emigrated from Canada and France in the year 1720. They have small farms and raise Indian corn, wheat, peas, potatoes, horses, cows, hogs, &c. Before the late war, this settlement was well stocked with cattle and horses ; some of the inhabitants having from 140 to 150 head of cattle. By frequent intermarriages with the Indians, and a long residence among them, nine-tenths of their women are of Indian origin ; they are said .to be modestly diffident, and to preserve a tolerable share of the ease and politeness of French manners. The in4 habitants have been frequently oppressed by the Indians, particularly since the commencement of the late war be tween the United States and Great Britain. The country between the Fox and Menomonie rivers is inviting to settlers ; the soil is good, and the climate much milder than at Michilimackinac, as the trees are clothed with verdure at least one month earlier. The sturgeon, trout, white-fish, and bass, of the bay, rivers, and creeks, are equal in flavour and delicacy to any in America, and can be taken with ease in almost any quan tity. Tbe soil on both sides of Fox river is very fine, and the wheat fields and gardens give it the appearance of a rich and fertile country: the timber is oak, walnut, sugar-maple, poplar, elm, pine, &c. The shores of the bay and rivers are agreeably diversified with prairies, islets of wood, and forests. The inhabitants have always been remarkably healthy ; and the United States' soldiers in garrison, are even said to enjoy a better state of health than the troops at Michilimackinac. The banks of Fox river continue low for two or three miles up, when they"], [729, "NORTH-WEST TERRITORY. 707 gradually rise about 100 feet above the water, from whence commence forests of oak, pine, hickory, and maple. The shores of this river, up to Winnebago lake, is said to be of the same nature ; to which cause, and the prevalence ofthe south-west wind in summer, may be attributed the healthi ness ofthe country. There are several villages of Indians on the islands and shores of Green bay ; at one of which, about a mile up Fox river, a great number of the natives assemble in spring and fall. Nine miles further up is another village, and another at the Kakalin portage: this portage is about a mile long, the ground even and rocky ; the fall about ten feet, which obstructs the navigation for nine miles, there being an almost continued rapid to Grand Kenomie, where there is a fall of five feet ; a little above this the river opens into Winnebago or Puan lake, at the dis tance of thirty miles. This lake is about thirty miles long; and from two to five wide ; at its entrance, is the first Indian village often or twelve lodges. About midway of the lake, is a town of fifty or sixty warriors ; and near the head of the lake is another village of fifteen or twenty houses. At the south-west comer of the lake, the Croco dile river enters from the direction of Rocky river, vvith which it communicates, with the interval of two or three portages. The land bordering on the lake is very fertile, and abounds with grapes, plums, and other fruits, which grow spontaneously : the Indians raise great quantities of corn, beans, pumpkins, squashes, &e. The lake swarms with fish of various sorts, and abounds with ducks, geese, and teal. Fox river falls into the lake about twelve miles from its outlet, and is here 100 yards wide. Six miles higher, is a small Indian village, and a lake about ten miles long ; three miles above this lake, the river DeLoup joins Fox river. The banks of the river are here diver sified with woods and prairies ; any quantity of hay may be made, and it is as fine a country for raising stock as any in the same latitude throughout America. From the river De Loup to lake Puckaway is about eighty miles ; here is another Indian village of eight or ten lodges: this lake is nine miles long. Twelve miles further up, is lake Du B\u0153uf, which is four leagues in length, and full of wild rice: water-fowl are as plentiful here in spring and autumn as on lake Winnebago. Ten miles above lake Du B\u0153uf, the river forks into two nearly equal branches ; but is so choked with wild rice, as to be almost impass able. Thirtv miles above the forks, is lake Vaseux, which 4x"], [730, "708 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. is a perfect meadow of wild rice ; from this lake to the portage is fifteen miles ; the river becomes more and more serpentine, and is so blocked up with wild rice, as almost to prevent the use of oars. At the portage it is ouly five yards wide, except where it expands into small lakes and rice ponds, and so crooked, that in navigating it five miles, you only get a quarter of a mile nigher the portage. The length of the portage is two miles in ordinary seasons, but is much reduced by heavy rains ; often to such a de gree that loaded boats have passed over when the waters were high. Near one half of the way between the rivers is a swamp, overgrown with long grass ; the rest of it a slain, with a few oak and pine trees growing thereon n wet seasons the portage road is very bad : the soil being of a swampy nature, there is for nearly half the way a kind of natural canal, which is sometimes used; but an artificial canal between the two rivers could be easily opened. The ground, at the head of Fox river, is often inundated by the Ouisconsin, so as to form one great lake at the head of both rivers. There are two or three French families established at the portage, which is situ ated about 350 miles to the east ofthe falls of St. Anthony, and about 240 from Prairie du Chiens. Goods trans ported for Is. 6d. per cwt., a canoe 22s. 6d. and a boat 36*. (English money) paid in goods at an enormous pro fit. \u2014 It is said that the United States government have it in contemplation to establish a military post at or near the portage. The Ouisconsin is about 100 yards wide at the portage, and flows with a smooth but strong current : in a low stage of water, the navigation is obstructed with sand bars. Its water is remarkably transparent, and the bot tom sandy ; the banks of the river are pleasant and fertile, skirted by bigh hills at the distance often or fifteen miles. The Saukies and Ottigaumy Indians formerly resided on its shores, in several large and well built towns. The great Saukie village, about one day's journey below the portage, contained, some years since, nearly 100 houses, each large enough for several families, built of hewn planks neatly jointed. Their streets were regular and spacious, their fields and gardens well laid out, in which were cultivated large quantities of Indian corn, beans, melons, squashes, &c. The lands near these towns are ofthe first quality. The valley of the Ouisconsin is from \u2022two to ten miles wide, and covered in places with valuable groves of white pine. The hills or mountains cover an extensive tract, the soil of which is generally poor, aud"], [731, "NORTH-WEST TERRITORY. 708 the timber a stinted growth of oak and hickory; stones mostly calcareous. Lead mines exist on the south side, the most important of which is situated near the Defour de Pin. The mountains to the south of the Ouisconsin were examined by captain Carver, and sound fo abound in lead ore ; and so plentiful was lead, in the great Saukie town above mentioned, that he saw large quantities of it lying about the streets. The town of Prairie du Chiens is situated on the east bank of the Ouisconsin, about a mile above its junction with the Mississippi. There are about sixty houses, prin- cipally in two streets, (Front and First streets ;) though some are scattered along the bottoms for the distance of four or sive mites. The ordinary population amounts to about 400 souls, except in spring and autumn, when the assemblage of white traders doubles this number, besides several hundred Indians. The inhabitants are chiefly French ; a great part of whom have a mixture of Indian blood in their veins. The town is bounded by high, bald hills, about half a mile distant. The United States havo erected a strong fort here. \u2014 The mouth ofthe Ouisconsin is in lat. 42\u00b0 N. The only Indian tribes who reside exclusively in this territory are the Menemonies and the Winnebagoes: tho first have eight or ten villages. This tribe is reduced to about 250 warriors ; they are brave, and much respected by their neighbours, and are permitted by the Sioux and the Chippewas to hunt on the Mississippi and lake Superior. They are remarkably handsome, have fino eyes and an animated delivery ; their language has no resemblance to that of their neighbours, and is very diffi- cult to be iearned. Their temporary lodges, of which they have vast numbers, are in the form of an ellipsis, thirty or forty feet long, and fifteen or sixteen wide, covered with rushes plaited into mats, and capable of sheltering sixty people from the storm. The Winnebagoes reside on the Ouisconsin, Rocky river, Fox river, and Green bay, and have nine villages : they can raise about 300 warriors. The remnant of the Ottigaumles reside be- tween the Ouisconsin and Rocky rivers. The Chippewas, inhabiting the southern shores of lake Superior, head branches of the Chippeway, and other streams running into the Mississippi, are estimated at 1,000 warriors. There are parts of three other tribes who reside in the east ern part of this territory, near the shores of lake Michigan; and the Sioux claim a considerable tract of country on the east side of the Mississippi, above Prairie du Chiens."], [732, "710 NORTH AMERICA. PROVINCE OF FLORIDA. Although a description of Florida is not in strictness entitled to a place in this work; yet from the peculiar circumstances in which that country is now placed, in relation to the government of the United States and that of Spain, and tbe important consequences likely to arise from the disputed territory, the following concise account of its geographical position, soil, climate, and natural productions, will perhaps at this time not be unacceptable to the general reader. This province is bounded on the north by the states of Georgia and Alabama; south, by the gulf of Mexico; east by the Atlantic ocean, and west by the river Perdido. It was originally divided into East and West; but the United States have, in virtue ofthe purchase of Louisiana, claimed and taken possession of all that part situated to the westward of the Perdido river. The province, so con stituted, extends from N. lat. 25\u00b0 fo 31\u00b0, and from long. 3\u00b0 30' to 10\u00b0 22' W. from Washington. The length from north fo south is 370 miles, and tbe greatest breadth from east to west is about 350 miles ; but the average breadth of the peninsula is only about 120. The area in square miles is nearly 58,000 ; but the population does not exceed 10,000, being nearly six .quare miles to one inhabitant. The principal rivers are the St. John's, Escambia, and Chatahouchy; but there are many smaller ones, and the bays are numerous, and some of them very extensive. The St. John's river rises in or near a large swamp in the heart of what is called East Florida, and pursues a northern course, in a broad navigable stream, which in several places spreads into wide bays or lakes, of which lake George is the chief. Vessels that draw ten feet water may navigate safely through the west channel into St. John's river, as far as lake George: it is thirty miles north of St. Augustine. Lake George is about fifteen miles wide, and generally about sixteen or twenty feet deep, except at the entrance of the river. The lake is beautified with two or three fertile islands, the largest of which is two miles broad, and commands a most delightful and extensive prospect of the waters, islands, east and west shores of the lake, the capes, the bay, and Mount Royal ; the view to the south is very fine. Here are evident marks of a larg\u00a9"], [733, "PROVINCE OF FLORIDA. 711 town of the natives having once heen situated here ; and the island appears to have been formerly the chosen resi dence of an Indian prince. On the site of this ancient town stands a very pompous mount, or conical pyramid of earth, from which runs, in a straight line, a grand avenue or Indian highway, through a magnificent grove of magnolias, live oaks, palms, and orange trees, termi nating at the verge of a large, green, level savannah. From fragments dug up, it appears to have been a thickly inhabited town. The Escambia is one of the most considerable rivers that fall into the bay of Pensacola, through several marshes aud channels, which have a number of islands between them, that are overflowed when the water is high. A shoal near its mouth prevents vessels drawing more than five or six feet from entering ; but there is from two to six fathoms water afterwards. It is uncertain where this river takes its rise ; captain Hutchins ascend ed it in a boat upwards of eighty miles, and from the depth of water there, it appeared to be navigable many miles further : its course is very winding. At the mouth ofthe river, on the west side, was the town of Cambleton, settled by French protestants in 1766, for the purpose of cultivating silk; but was afterwards abandoned, in con sequence of its unhealthy situation. The lands in gene ral, on each side of the river, are rich, low, or swampy, admirably adapted for the culture of rice or Indian corn. The great number of rivulets which fall into the river from the high circumjacent country, may be led over any part of the rice lands, at any season of the year. The nume rous islands at the mouth of the river, some of very con siderable extent, are not inferior for rice to any in America. The settlements made by some gentlemen several years since, are very evident proofs of this assertion ; who with in two years of their first attempt at cultivation, had nearly cleared all the expenses they had been at in making very considerable establishments; and would entirely have done it in another year, had not the Spaniards taken pos session of the country. The Chatahouchy river has been described page 499 : it is onlv necessary to observe here, that previous to as suming the name of Apalachicola, it is about thirty rods wide, very rapid, and full of shoals: the lands on its banks are light and thin. The Lower Creek Indians are settled in scattering clans and villages from the head to the mouth of this river. The face of the country throughout Florida is, gene,-"], [734, "712 NORTH AMERICA. rally speaking, light and sandy. In the interior there is a ridge of sandy hills, but there is no bold scenery; white the country abounds in many places with swamps aud marshes to such a degree, as to render those particular spots very unhealthy. Having such an extensive sea- coast, however, on which there are a great number of fine harbours, there are many choice situations for towns; and the whole country, if cleared, drained, and cultivated, would support a numerous population. There is a great deal of excellent alluvial land on the banks ofthe rivers, and the intervals between the hills are many of them rich, affording fine ranges for cattle. The eastern part ofthe province, near to and about St. Augus- tine, is by far the most unfruitful ; yet even there two crop* of Indian com are annually produced. The interior country, which is high and pleasant, abounds with wood of almost every kind, particularly white, red, and live oak in such profusion, as would furnish all the maritime powers in the world with a constant supply of the best ship timber. The live oaks, though not tall, contain a prodigious quantity of timber. The trunk is generally from twelve to twenty feet in circumference ; it rises ten or twelve feet from the earth, and then brancbesinto four or five great limbs, which grow in nearly a horizontal direction, forming a gentle curve. \" I have stepped (says Bartram) above fifty paces, on a straight line, from the trunk of one of these trees to the extremity of the limbs.\" They are evergreen, and the wood almost incor- ruptible. They bear a great quantity of small acorns, which is agreeable food when roasted, and from which the Indians extract a sweet oil, wbich they use in cooking rice. Besides the varieties of oak above mentioned, the country abounds with the beautiful laurel magnolia, pine, hickory, cypress, and cedar. The cypress is the largest of the American trees ; being often eight, ten, or twelve feet in diameter, for forty or fifty feet shaft. The trunks make excellent shingles, boards, and other timber ; and when hollowed out, form durable and convenient canoes. The garden vegetables are in high perfection ; the orange and lemon trees grow here, without cultivation, to a large size, and produce better fruit than in Spain and Portugal. Most of the oranges consumed in the southern states are brought from Florida, and particularly from the island of Anastasia, opposite St. Augustine. About sixty years ago the seeds were brought from India, and given to an inhabitant of this island, who so increas* \u00abd them, that at his death, which happened a few years"], [735, "PROVINCE OF FLORIDA. 713 since, he had a beautiful plantation of orange trees, be- tween forty and fifty acres in extent, and of the finest quality. There seems to be but a small supply of minerals in this Country. Limestone and iron ore are found on the banks of the Apalachicola river, and there are some mineral springs. Florida being nearly surrounded by the sea, and within the range of the trade wiuds, enjoys a comparatively temperate climate. The summers are generally pleasant, and the winters very mild. Frost and snow are never seen, except in the northern extremity, and there but seldom. Cattle graze in the fields all winter, and many places produce two crops in a year. The principal towns are St. Augustine, on the Atlantic, and Pensacola, on the Gulf of Mexico.\u2014 St. Augustine, the capital of East Florida, is situated about eighty leagues from the mouth ofthe gulf of Florida, and 316 miles south-west from Charleston, in South Carolina. It is of an oblong figure, and intersected by four streets, which cut each other at right angles. The town is fortified and defended by a castle called fort St. John : it has a church and monastery of the order of its name.\u2014 The breakers at the entrance of the harbour have formed two channels, whose bars have eight feet water each. N. lat. 30\u00b0, W. long. 4\u00b0 30' from Washington. Pensacola, the capital of West Florida, lies along the bay of that name, is about a mile in length, and a quarter Of a mile in breadth, healthy and delightfully situated. While in possession of the British, it contained several hundred habitations; and many ofthe public buildings and houses were spacious and elegant : the governor's palace is a large stone building, ornamented with a tower, built by Spain. Since this town has been in the posses- sion of the Spaniards, it has been on the decline. The exports, consisting of skins, logwood, dying-stuff, and silver dollars, amounted while in the possession of the British, to \u00a363,000 annually: the average annual value of exports for three years, from Great Britain, was \u00a397,000. The town and fort of Pensacola surrendered to the arms of Spain in the year 1781, and with them the whole pro- vince. The old fortifications stood on some sand hills behind the town, too distant to yield any effectual protec- tion. The harbour of Pensacola is on the north shore of the gulf of Mexico, thirty-three mites east of Mobile, and 474 west of the islands of Tortuga. It is a beautiful body \u00a9f water, spacious, and safe from all winds, and has sour"], [736, "714 NORTH AMERICA. fathoms water at its entrance, deepening gradually to seven or eight. The bar lies in N. lat. 30\u00b0 15', and admits of vessels drawing no more than twelve feet water. This harbour, and others on this coast, are infested with worms to such a degree, as to ruin vessels in two months, if care be not taken to prevent it. There are many small tribes of Indians scattered over the province, most of whom are able to procure the ne cessaries of life with little trouble, and live in a much more comfortable manner than the generality of their brethren. About seventy miles west from St. Augustine, the Alachua tribe had their residence, upon a level, green plain, above fifteen miles over, and fifty miles in circum ference. It is encircled with high sloping hills, covered with waving forests, and fragrant orange groves, rising from a most fertile soil. In this extensive Savannah is an inclosed plantation, which is worked and attended by the whole community ; yet every family has its parti cular share, which is gathered and deposited in its private granary, setting apart a small contribution tor the public store, which stands in the midst of the plantation. The ancient Alachua town stood on the borders of this Savan nah ; but the Indians removed to Cuscowilla, two miles distant, on account of the unhealthiness of the former site, occasioned by the stench of the putrid fish and reptiles, in the summer and autumn, driven on shore by the alligators, and the noxious exhalations from the adjoining marshes. Though the horned cattle and horses bred in these meadows are large, sleek, sprightly, and fat, yet they are subject to mortal diseases ; such as the water rot, or scald, occasioned by the warm water they are obliged to drink; while those which range in the high forests are clear of this disorder. Cuscowilla, the present residence of the Alachua tribe, stands in the most delightful situation that could be de sired in an inland country ; upon a high, swelling ridge of hills, within 400 yards of a large and beautiful lake, abounding with fish and wild fowl. The lake is termi nated on one side by immense forests, consisting of orange groves, overtopped with grand magnolias, palms, poplars, live oak, &c, on the other side by extensive greeu plains and meadows. The town consists of about tbirty habita tions, each of which consists of two houses, nearly of the same size, large and convenient, and closely covered with the bark of the cypress tree. Each family has a small garden, containing corn, beans, tobacco, and other vegetables ; but the whole tribe still continue to cultivate,"], [737, "715 LOWER CANADA. With great care, the ldrge plantation on the Alachua Savan nah above described. Florida has frequently changed masters ; belonging alternately to the French and Spaniards, and at one period to the English. West Florida, as far as Perdido river, was owned and occupied by the French ; the re mainder, and all East Florida, was possessed by the Spani ards, previous to the whole country being ceded to Great Britain, at the peace of 1763. During the American revo lutionary war, both the Floridas were taken by the Spani ards, and guaranteed to the crown of Spain by the defini tive treaty of 1783. A treaty has been lately concluded between the American government and the Spanish ambassador at Washington, sor transferring the province of Florida to the United States ; but the crooked and cor rupt policy of the government of Spain, instigated, it is said, by another government, equally corrupt, has refused to ratify the treaty. In the mean time, the American troops are stated to have taken possession ofthe country; of which no power that can be sent from Europe will be able to dispossess them. Indeed, a reference to the map will fully prove, that Florida is equally an integral part of the United States territory as Cornwall is of Great Britain ; nor can it be expected that the Americans will permit it to remain longer in the possession of any foreign power. BRITISH POSSESSIONS, LOWER CANADA. Situation, Boundaries, and Extent. This extensive province is situated upon both sides of the river St. Lawrence, and extends from N. lat. 45\u00b0 to 53\u00b0, and from 4\u00b0 W. to 12\u00b0 30' E. long, from Washing ton. Its greatest length, from east to west, is about 750 miles ; and breadth, from north to south, about 560 mites. Seventy miles of this province border on New York, ninety on Vermont, thirty-three on New Hampshire, and 245 on Maine. The principal river of both the Canadas is the St. Law rence, described in page 18; but there are many other 4y"], [738, "716 NORTH AMERICA. considerable streams, several of which flow into the St. Lawrence ; and most of these have the land on their banks highly improved ; indeed the settlements are mostly confined to the margins of rivers, as the greater part of the interior of the country is covered with forests ; but, except in the meadows, the trees are generally of small growth. The river Ouelle, which enters the great river about 100 miles below Quebec, is an example of this kind. For several miles before it joins the St. Lawrence, it runs through a level and very fertile country ; and is naviga ble a considerable way for small vessels. This district is in a good state of cultivation, and very populous; as are also the neigbouring great parishes of Kamouraska and St. Ann's. The De Sud rises in the mountains to the southward, and falls into the St. Lawrence at St. Thomas, after water ing a rich and beautiful plain, which extends up into the country for many miles. On the branches of this river, and on those of the Ouelle, are many fine situations for farmers; even superior to what can be found on the De Loup, which is 200 miles further up the St. Lawrence, and consequently more southwardly \u2022 though there cer tainly is an extensive tract of very valuable land between Quebec and Montreal. The rive Montmorenci rises in the north-east, and runs a very irregular course, through a wild and thickly wooded country, and over a bed of broken rocks, until it approaches within 300 yards of the St. Lawrence, seven miles below Quebec. Here the channel being bounded by precipitous rocks, its breadth becomes much' contracted, and the rapidity of the current is greatly augmented. On the east side the bank is about fifty feet high, and nearly perpendicular ; the opposite bank being of a very singular shape, resembling the ruins ofa lofty wall. The river de scends between them with a foaming current, broken by huge masses of stone at the bottom, till it comes to tbe brink of a precipice, down which it falls in one uninter rupted and nearly perpendicular direction of 246 feet, forming one of the most sublime views in the world. The breadth of the fall is 100 feet, and the water in its descent has the exact appearance of snow, as when thrown in heaps from the roof of a house, and it seemingly descends with a slow motion. An advantageous view of this grand fall maybe obtained from the beach ofthe St. Law rence, when it is low water. St. Maurice river falls into the St. Lawrence at Trois"], [739, "717 LOWER CANADA. Rivieres, about halfway between Quebec and Montreal ; it is the largest stream of upwards of thirty which flow into that great river, on the north-west side alone, between those those towns. This river, before it unites with the St. Lawrence, is divided into three streams by two large islands ; from hence it is that the town of Trois Rivieres takes its name. The St. Maurice is not navigable, even for sloops, more than a few miles above its mouth ; but in flat- bottomed boats and canoes it may be ascended nearly to its source ; from whence the distance is uot great to the head of navigable rivers that fall into Hudson's bay. At a future day, therefore, if ever the dreary waste through which it passes shall become the abode of human beings instead of wild beasts, this river may be esteemed of the first importance in a commercial point of view. At pre- sent there are a few scattered settlements on each side of it, from its mouth as far as the iron works, which are about nine miles distant from Trois Rivieres ; beyond that, the country is but little known, except to the Indians. Sorel river, which falls into the St. Lawrence about forty-five miles below Montreal, passes through a country equal in beauty and fertility to any of the others, and is of great value to Canada, because it rises in lake Cham- plain, in the United States, from whence great quantities of valuable produce are annually introduced. Indeed, it is the only channel allowed by law for the commerce of the States with Lower Canada ; and at the town of St. John's, near the lake, the British have a custom-house, wbich takes cognizance of whatever passes that way. There are likewise some troops stationed here, and all persons who pass either way are examined by the com- manding officer ; but those who do not wish to be known, find other means of getting from one country to the other, without going by St. John's. Uttawas, or Grand river joins the St. Lawrence about thirty miles above Montreal, and is the boundary between Upper and Lower Canada. This river is the route taken by the Lower Canada traders, and others, to the north- west country for the purchase of furs. The merchandise for the Indians is carried up the Uttawas in canoes, made of the bark of the birch tree, the largest of which are about two tons burden ; but they seldom carry so much upon this river, it being in many places shallow, rapid, and full of rocks, and contains no less than thirty-two portages. Having ascended the Uttawas about 280 mites, which requires eighteen days to perform, they cross a portage into lake Nippising, and from this lake by au-"], [740, "718 NORTH AMERICA. other portage, they get upon French river, which carrys them into lake Huron, from which they pass through the straits of St. Mary, and by another portage into lake Superior ; coasting along its shores, they come to the Grand Portage, and from thence by a chain of small lakes and rivers they proceed on to Rainy lake, Lake-of the-woods, and for hundreds of mites beyond it, through lake Winnipeg, &c. a total distance of more than 2,000 mites. In the same manner they return to Canada with their valuable cargoes of furs and peltries; chiefly the property of the North-west Company, the principal part of whom reside in Montreal. \u2014 The other rivers of this province, though very numerous, are iu general but imperfectly known, and comparatively of minor importance. A de tailed account of them would, therefore, convey little information to the reader, and would swell this brief description of Lower Canada beyond its prescribed limits. Face of the country, soil, climate, natural productions, &c. \u2014 The eastern part of the province between Quebec and the gulf of St. Lawrence, is mountainous ; and be tween Quebec and the mouth of the Uttawas river, also a few scattered mountains are to be met with ; but higher up the St. Lawrence the country is level. The soil, except where small tracts of stony aud sandy land intervene, consists principally of a loose dark coloured earth, and of the depth of ten or twelve inches, below which there is a bed of cold clay. The earth towards the surface is extremely fertile ; of which there cannot be a greater proof, than that it continues to yield plentiful crops, notwithstanding its being worked year after year without ever being manured. It is only within a few years back, indeed, that the Canadians have begun to manure their lands, and many still continue, from father to son, to work the same field without intermission, and without ever putting any manure upon them, yet the land is not exhausted. The manure principally made use of by the best farmers is marie, found in prodigious quantities in many places along the shores of the St. Law rence. The soil of Lower Canada is particularly suited to the growth of small grain. Tobacco also thrives upon it; it is only raised, however, in small quantities for private use, more than one half of what is used in the country being imported. The Canadian tobacco is of a much milder quality than that grown in Maryland"], [741, "Lower Canada. 719 and Virginia: the snuff made from it is held in high estimation. The climate is very severe, and the heat and cold go to great extremes. The thermometer rises sometimes in summer to 98% and in winter the mercury freezes. The winter sets in early in November, and continues till April, during which the ground is entirely covered with suow, often from four to six feet deep. In January and February the frost is so intense, that there is danger of being frost-biddeu ; and to guard against it the inhabit ants cover the whole body with furs, except the eyes and nose. Of Canada in general, embracing both provinces, it may be said, that winter continues with such severity, from the beginning of December to the end of April, as that the largest rivers are frozen over : but the air is so serene aud clear, and the inhabitants so well defended against the cold, that this season is neither unhealthy nor unpleasant. The extremes of heat and cold in Canada are amazing ; yet those very sudden transitions which in some other countries are so injurious to the constitution are unknown here : the seasons also are much more re gular. Though the snow generally begins to fall iu November, sometimes it comes down as early as the latter end of October. This is the most disagreeable part of the whole year ; the air is then cold and raw, and the sky dark and gloomy; two days seldom pass over together without a fall of snow or sleet. By the end of the first or second week, however, in December, the clouds are generally dissolved, the frost sets in, the sky assumes a bright and azure hue, and for weeks together it continues the same, without being obscured by a single cloud. The greatest degree of cold which they experience in Canada is in the month of January, when for a few days it is sometimes so intense, that it is impossible for a human being to re main out of doors for any considerable time. These very cold days, however, do not come altogether, but inter vene generally at some little distance from each other; and between them, in the depth of winter, the air is some times so warm, that people in exercise in the middle of the day, feel disposed to lay aside the thick fur cloaks usually worn out of doors. Winter in Canada is the season of general amusement. The clear frosty weather no sooner commences, than all thoughts about business are laid aside, and every one de votes himself to pleasure. The inhabitants meet in con vivial parties at each other's housesj and pass the day"], [742, "720 NORTH AMERICA. with music, dancing, card-playing, and every social enter tainment tbat can beguile the time. At Montreal, iu par ticular, such a constant and friendly intercourse is kept up amongst the inhabitants, that It appears then as if the town were inhabited by one large family. Though the cold is so very intense in Canada, yet the inhabitants never suffer from it ; constant experience having taught them how to guard against it effectually. In the first place, by means of stoves they keep their habitations as warm and comfortable as can be desired. In the large houses they generally have four or five stoves placed in the hall, and in the apartments on the ground floor, from whence flues pass iu different directions through the upper rooms. Besides these stoves, they likewise frequently have open fires in the lower apart ments ; it is more, however, on account of the cheerful appearance they give the room, than for the sake of the warmth they afford, as by the stoves the rooms can be heated to any degree. Lest any cold blasts should pene trate from without, they have also double doors, and if the house stands exposed, even double windows, about six inches apart. Nor do tbe inhabitants suffer from cold when they go abroad ; for they never stir out without being nearly covered with furs. Their caps entirely cover the ears, the back of the neck and the greatest part of the face, and their large and thick cloaks effectually secure the body ; besides which they wear fur gloves, muffs, and shoes. The rapid progress of vegetation in Canada, as soon as. the winter is over, is truly astonishing. Spring has scarcely appeared when you find it is summer. In a few days the fields are clothed with tbe richest verdure, and the trees obtain their foliage. The various productions of the garden eome in after each other in quick succes sion, and the grain sown in May affords a rich harvest by the latter end of July. This part of the year, in which spring and summer are so happily blended together, is delightful beyond description ; nature then puts on ber gayest dress, at the same time the heat is not found oppressive before the beginning of August, when a few days often intervene when the heat is overcoming. The fall of the year is a most agreeable season in Canada, as well as the summer. Though the winter be long and tedious, and the climate oold, yet the soil is in general very good, and in many parts both pleasant and fertile, producing wheat, barley, rye, with many other sorts of grain, fruits, and vegetables-."], [743, "LOWER CANADA. 721 The style of farming amongst the generality of the French Canadians has hitherto been very slovenly ; manure has been but rarely used, the earth just lightly turned up with the plough, and, without any other preparation, the grain sown: more than one half of the fields also have been left without any sences whatsoever, exposed to the rava ges of cattle. But since the amazing influx of emigrants from Great Britain and Ireland into Canada, the people are beginning to be more industrious and better farmers. They are also greatly encouraged by the merchants at Quebec and Montreal, who send agents through the coun try to the farmers to buy up all the corn they can spare ; which they are bound to have ready on a certain day on the banks of the St. Lawrence, and boats are then sent by the merchants to receive and convey it to the place of destination. The cultivated lands do not extend far back in general. Nearly all the settlements in Lower Canada lie contiguous to the St. Lawrence, and on the banks of streams flowing into it. This is chiefly owing to the disposition of the French Canadians, who, like the Germans in the United States, are fond of living near each other ; nay more, as long as the farm of the father will admit of a division, a share of it is given to the sous when they are grown up ; and it is only when the farm is very small, or the family numerous, that they ever think of taking up a piece of fresh land from the proprietor. Besides the different kinds of grain already mentioned, garden vegetables of every description come to the great est perfection in Canada, as well as most of the European fruits ; the currants, gooseberries, and raspberries, are in particular very fine. The latter are found in profusion in the woods, as is also the vine ; but tbe grapes which it produces in its uncultivated state are very poor, sour, and but little larger than fine currants. The variety of trees found in the forests of Canada is amazing, and it is sup posed that many kinds are still unknown : beech trees, oaks, elms, ashes, pines, sycamores, chesnuts, walnuts, of each of which several different species are commonly met with. The sugar-maple tree is also found in almost every part of the country; a tree never seen but upon good ground. A maple tree of the diameter of twenty inches, will commonly yield sufficient sap for making five pounds of sugar each year ; and instances have been known of trees yielding nearly this quantity annually for a series of thirty years. The maple is the only sort of raw sugar made use of in the country parts of Canada; it is very"], [744, "722 NORTH AMERICA. generally used also by the inhabitants of the towns, whither it is brought for sale by the country people who attend the markets, just the same as any other kind of country produce. The sap of the maple tree is not only useful in yielding sugar, but most excellent vinegar may likewise be made from it: good table beer may also be made from the sap, and if distilled it affords a very fine spirit. Towns, settlements, inhabitants, &c. \u2014 Quebec, the capi tal, not only of Lower Canada, but of all British America, was founded in the year 1607, by a colony from France, as already noticed, page 8 It is situated on a prominent point of land, on the north-west side of the river St. Lawrence, about 400 miles from the sea, in N. lat. 46\u00b0 52', W. long, from London 71\u00b0, aud 6\u00b0 E. from Washington. It is eighty miles distant from the nearest point iu the United States, in the state of Maine ; 170 from Montreal ; 243 from Plattsburgh, in the state of New York ; and 421 from Albany, in the same state. The town is divided into upper and lower. The upper town stands on a high lime stone rock, of great natural strength, and it is well forti fied. The citadel is constructed on the highest part of Cape Diamond, 350 feet above the river, and is very strong : the whole works have of late years been much improved. The lower town occupies the ground at the basis of the promontory, which has been gained from the cliffs, on one side, by mining, and from the river, on the other, by the construction of wharfs. This is the prin cipal place of commerce, and the residence of the mer chants, being conveniently near their business ; but it lies much exposed to an enemy, being defended merely by a small battery towards the bason, which, at the time of high tides, is nearly on a level with the water, and by batteries towards the river, in which guns may be planted when there is any danger of an attack. \u2014 The upper town, however, is a place of prodigious strength, and may justly be called a second Gibraltar. In consequence of the peculiarity of situation, the streets are generally irregular and uneven, many of them very narrow, and but few of them are paved. The houses are for the most part built of stone, and are very rough and unsightly, the interior being plain and devoid of taste. The public buildings are numerous; but the greater part of them are equally destitute of taste and elegance with the private buildings; though much labour"], [745, "LOWER CANADA. 723 and expense must have been bestowed upon their con struction. The principal public buildings are the Catholic cathedral church, the Jesuits college, the seminary, Pro testant metropolitan church, the court-house, the hotel Dieu, convent of Ursuline nuns, library, general hospi tal, &c. The monastery, once a building of considerable importance, was destroyed by fire in 1796, and the order became extinct.\u2014 In the year 1785, this city contained 6,472 inhabitants ; the present population, from the most recent accounts, appears to be about 16,000; about two thirds of whom are of French extraction, who are gay and lively, and the inhabitants generally are represented as being polite and hospitable. The river, opposite the city, is from 900 to 1,000 yards broad, and its greatest depth, at high water, thirty fathoms, the anchorage being every where safe and good. The flow of the tide is very strong, rising usually to eighteen feet, and at spring tides to twenty-four. The river, in winter, is mostly frozen over, when the scene becomes very amusing and interesting, affording tbe country peo ple, on the south side, an opportunity of bringing their produce to market over the ice ; and presenting a field for the exercise of tbe citizens, who are frequently seen driv ing their horses and carriages on the frozen surface of the river. Below the town, the river widens out into a spacious basin, capable of containing a vast quantity of shipping, of the largest size. Immediately below this, it is divided by the island of Orleaus into two streams, from whence it widens out to fifteen miles ; at Saguenai river, 110 miles lower down, it is eighteen miles wide ; at Cape Cat, 120 miles nigher the sea, it is thirty miles in breadth ; and at its mouth, 120 miles further, it is no less than ninety miles wide, and discharges one of the largest collections of fresh water on the surface of the globe. It is navigable with ships of the line to Quebec, and, with vessels drawing fourteen feet water, to Montreal, 170 miles higher : small craft can proceed to Kingston, on lake Ontario, 193 miles above Montreal. \u2014 The tide flows to Three rivers, about eighty-five miles below Montreal. Quebec was besieged by the British in 1711, without success ; but was taken by them in September, 1759, when the gallant general Wolfe, who commanded the army of besiegers, lost his life. In December, 1775, it was at tacked by the Americans, under the command of the brave gen.ral Montgomery, who was slain, and his army repulsed. Independent to what it owes to its fortifications, and situation on the top of a rock, Quebec is indebted NO. XXXI. 4 z"], [746, "724 LOWER CANADA. for much of its strength to the great length and severity of the winter ; as in that season it is wholly impracticable for a besieging army either to carry on any works, or to blockade the town. It requires about 5,000 soldiers to man the works completely. A large garrison is always kept in it, and abundance of stores of every description. The troops are lodged partly in barracks, and partly in block-houses near Cape Diamond. The cape is strongly fortified, and may be considered as the citadel of Quebec ; as it commands the town in every direction, and also the plains at the outside of the walls. Notwithstanding the great height of the rock, water of very good quality may readily be had even at the very top of it. About 10,000 stand of arms are kept in the armoury, arranged in a simi lar manner with the arms in the Tower of London ; but, if possible, with greater neatness, and more fancy. The market of Quebec is extremely well supplied with provisions of every kind, which may be purchased at a very moderate price. It is a matter of curiosity to a stranger, to see the number of dogs yoked to little carts that are brought into this market by the people who attend it. The Canadian dogs are found extremely useful in drawing burdens, and there is scarcely a family in Quebec or Montreal that does not keep one or more of them for that purpose. A single dog can draw a man often stone weight for a considerable distance; and people, during the winter season, frequently perform long journeys on the snow, with half a dozen or more of these animals yoked in a cariole* or sledge. The society in Quebec is agreeable, and very extensive for a place of the size ; owing to its being the capital of t_e|lower province, and therefore the residence of the governor, different civil officers, principal lawyers, &c. These circumstances, added to the large garrison always supported here, render the town a gay and lively place. From Quebec to Montreal, 170 miles, in sailing up the river, the eye is entertained with beautiful landscapes, the banks being in many places very bold and steep, and shaded with lofty trees. The farms lie pretty close all \u2022 Tie Canadian cariole, or sledge, resembles the body of a chaise placed npon two iron runners or slides, similar in shape to the irons of a pair of skates, it is culculated to hold two persons and a driver ; and, unless when dogs are employed, is _> ually drawn by one horse, at the rate of eighty miles a day : if two horses are made use of, they are placed one before the other, as the track in the roads will not Bdmit of their going abreast. The carioles glide over the snow with great smooth ness, and so little noise do they make in sliding along, that it is necessary to hav\u00bb a number of bells attached to the harnass, or a person continually sounding a hors, to guard against accidents."], [747, "725 LOWER CANADA. the way, several gentlemen's houses, neatly built, shew themselves at intervals, and there is all the appearance of a flourishing colony. Passengers who chuse to travel by land, may either have a calash to go the whole way, or from post-house to post-house. Between the two towns they genereally make twenty-four posts; and you get into Montreal on the morning of the third day, with out travelling by night. The usual charge for posting is only Is. 3d. a league, or bd. an English mile. The road runs the whole way along the St. Lawrence, and may be said to be almost a continued street ; one house succeding another so quickly, that there is not a mite vacant through out the whole extent. Except the town of Trois Rivieres, there is scarcely any place that deserves the name of a town ; but every parish church has a village in its neigh bourhood ; and of these there are, between Quebec and Montreal, upwards of twenty. Many of these villages are probably the beginnings of large county towns ; for here the parishes contain as much ground as many of the counties do in England. All the houses have a remark ably handsome appearance at a distance, and the churches are kept in the neatest repair ; most of them have spires, covered with tin, that, from being put on in a particular manner, never becomes rusty. It is pleasing beyond de scription to behold one of these villages opening to the view, as you sail round a point of land covered with trees, the houses in it overhanging the river, and the spires of the chnrches sparkling through the groves with which they are encircled, before the rays ofthe setting sun. The houses in Lower Canada are in general well fur nished with beds, all in the French style, very large, and raised four or five feet high, with a palliasse, a mattress, and a feather bed. The dwellings for the most part are built of fogs; but they are very compact and well fur nished, the logs are made to fit closely together ; instead of being left rough and uneven on the outside, are planed and whitewashed, and in the inside the walls are lined with deal boards. Before dismissing the account of Quebec, it will be pro per to briefly notice two scenes particularly deserving of attention, viz. tbe Fall ofthe river Montmorenci, and that of the Chaudiere ; both in the vicinity of Quebec. The Montmorenci fall has been already noticed in page 357, and is tremendously magnificent. The fall in the river Chaudiere is not half the height of that of the Montmo renci, but it is 250 feet in breadth. The scenery round this cataract is much superior in every respect to that in the"], [748, "726 LOWER CANADA. neighbourhood of the Montmorenci. Contiguous to the latter there are few trees of any great magnitude, and no thing is near it to relieve the eye ; there is the fall, and nought but the fall, to contemplate. The banks of the Chaudiere, on the contrary, are covered with trees ofthe largest growth, and amidst the piles of broken rocks, which lie scattered about the place, you have some of the wildest and most romantic views imaginable. As for the fall itself, its grandeur varies with the season : when the river is full, a body of water comes rushing over the rocks of the pre cipice that astonishes the beholder ; but in dry weather, and during summer, the quantity of water is but trifling. At these times, the Montmorenci fall claims the superiority over the fall of La Chaudiere. Montreal is the next town of any consequence upon the St. Lawrence ; it is situated on the island of Montreal, which is thirty miles in length and ten in breadth, and has its name from a very high mountain about the middle of it, which it seems to overlook like a monarch from his throne ; heuce the French called it Mont-real, or Royal Mountain. The town is situated on the south side of the island, and near the upper end of it, at the dis tance of 170 miles south-west of Quebec, 110 north-west of Crown Point, on lake Champlain, 308 north-west of Boston, and 350 north-east of Niagara.. N. lat, 45* 35', W. long. 73\u00b0 il' from London. \\t. is a large and hand some place, containing about 14,00 houses (whereof 500 only are within the walls) and 9,000 inhabitants, the mass of whom are French Canadians. The principal part of the houses are in the suburbs, built chiefly of wood ; the others of stone : none of them are elegant, but there are many comfortable habitations, This town has, at various times, suffered much by fire ; to guard against which, most of the houses have sheet-iron shutters to the doors and windows, and the roofs of the houses are covered with tin plates instead of shingles, which gives them a dull and sombre appearance. The streets are all very narrow, three of which run parallel to the river, intersected by others at right angles, but not at regular distances. There are six churches in Montreal; one for English Episcopalians, one sor Presbyterians, and sour for Roman Catholics. The ca thedral church belonging to the latter is a very spacious building, and contains five altars, all very richly decorated. There seems something in the Canadian climate unfavour- able to the growth of Protestant churches, though the Eng- lish inhabitants are great friends to Protestant ascendancy; a feeling less costly than church building. The college,"], [749, "727 LOWER CANADA. or seminary, is a capacious stone building, and has been lately repaired and enlarged ; it was originally endowen as a branch of the seminary oi' Paris, and has afforded ad asylum, through the British government, to several ofthe members of the latter, who fled at the revolution. There are also four convents in Montreal, one of which is ofthe order of St. Francis. The barracks are situated near the river, at the lower eud of the town, and will contain about 300 men. The walls round the sown are decaying fast, but the gates remain perfect. The walls were built principally as a defence against the Indians, by whom the country was thickly inhabited when Montreal was founded, and they were found useful in repelling the open attacks of these people in 1736: however, in their best state, these walls were not sufficient to protect the town against cannon. Most of the eminent merchants in Montreal are either English, Scotch, Irish, or their descendants. The French retain the manners and customs of their ancestors, as well as language ; they have an unconquerable aversion to learn English, and very few speak it : but the English inhabit ants are well acquainted with the French language. The people of Montreal are extremely hospitable and attentive to strangers, sociable in private life, and fond of convivial amusements. The soil of Montreal is luxuriant, and much cultivated. The fur trade is carried on here to a great extent ; most of the furs imported from Canada to England being ship ped at this place. This very lucrative trade is carried on by the North West Company, and by some private indivi duals on their own account. The company has no pecu liar law privileges, but from its great capital is enabled to trade into remote parts, to the exclusion of other traders. It was formed originally by the merchants of Montreal, who wisely considered that the trade could be carried on to those distant parts of tbe continent, inhabited solely by Indians, with more security and greater profit, if they joined together in a body. The stock of the company was divided into forty shares ; it is now more numerous. The trade is principally carried on by means of the Utawas, or Grand River, which falls into the St. Lawrence about 30 miles above Montreal, and which forms by its confluence with that river, \" Le Lac de Deux Montagnes et le Lac St. Louis,\" \u2014 the lake of the two mountains and the lake of Sf . Louis ; wherein are several large islands. Besides the furs and pelts conveyed down to Montreal from the north-western parts of the continent, by means of the Ufa ."], [750, "728 LOWER CANADA. was River, there are large quantities brought across the lakes, and down the river St Lawrence. Trois Rivieres is situated on the St. Lawrence, 55 mites S. W. of Quebec. It contains 400 houses, and about 2,000 inhabitants, and ranks as the third town, in point of size, in the provinces. It is one ofthe oldest settlement-; in the country, but has increased very slowly in size, owing to the country bordering upon the St. Maurice not being yet settled. The streets are narrow, and the houses in general small and indifferent ; many being built of wood. There are two churches in the town, the one English Episco palian, the other a large Roman Catholic parish church. An old monastery of the Franciscan order, a large stone building, is now quite deserted; aud many of the neigh bouring houses are also uninhabited, giving to the whole a dull gloomy aspect. The college or monastery of the Jesuits has been converted into a gaol. The only reli gious order at present e.xisting in the town is that of St. Ursule ; the sisterhood are tolerably numereus. It was founded by M. de St. Vallier, bishop of Quebec, in 1677. It is a spacious building, containg a chapel and hospital. Between Trois Rivieres and Montreal, and forty-five miles below the latter, stands the town of Sorel, at the mouth of a river of the same name, which runs from lake Champlain into the St. Lawrence, ll was laid out about the year 1787, and on an extensive plan, with very wide streets and a large square ; but it does not yet contain above 120 bouses, and most of these are meanly built. This is the only town on the St. Lawrence, between Mont real and Quebec, wherein English is the predominant language. The inhabitants consist principally of loyalists from the United States who took refuge in Canada. The chief business carried on here is that of ship-building ; there are several vessels annually launched from fifty to 200 tons burden ; these are floated down to Quebec, and and there rigged. The river Sorel is deep at the mouth, and affords good shelter for ships from the ice, at the breaking up of winter: it is not navigable far beyond the town, even in boats, on account ofthe rapids. The birch-tree is found in great plenty near this town ; but it is from the more northern parts of the country, where the tree attains a very large size, that the principal part of the bark is procured that canoes are made with. This bark somewhat resembles that of the cork-tree, but is ofa closer grain, and more pliable, for it admits of being rolled up like a piece of cloth. The birch canoes made at Three Rivers are put together with the utmost neatness, and on the water they appear very beautiful."], [751, "729 UPPER CANADA. The villages between Trois Rivieres and Montreal are very numerous, and the face of the adjacent country is pleasing to the eye of the traveller as he passes on ; but there is nothing in this part of the country particularly deserving of mention. UPPER CANADA. Situation, soil, climate, tyc. \u2014 Upper Canada lies to the north of the great lakes, and is separated from New York by the river St. Lawrence, and the lakes Ontario and Erie. The soil of Upper Canada is well adapted to the growth of hemp; and iron ore is found in many parts of the country. Copper is also found here, in much greater abundance than iron, and is extracted from the earth with considerably less trouble : on the borders of a river, which falls into the south-west side of Lake Superior, virgin copper is found in the greatest abundance ; as also on most of the islands on the eastern sides of it. The face of the country is invariably flat ; the picturesque is but scan tily spread through this tract of country : occasionally, however, on emerging from a dark clump of pines, or hickory wood, the eye dwells with pleasure on the course of the river, broken with wooded islands, and foaming over a thousand rocks. The winters in Upper Canada are very severe whilst they last ; but the snow seldom lies longer than three months on the ground. The summers are intensely hot ; Fahrenheit's thermometer often rising to 96\u00b0, and some times above 100\u00b0. There are luxuriant crops of Indian corn, some ofthe stems of which grow as high as seven or eight feet: between the rows they sow gourds, squashes, and melons, of which last every sort attains to a state as great perfection in the open air, throughout the inhabited parts of the two provinces. Peaches, in this part of the country, likewise come to perfection in the open air ; but in Lower Canada the summers are too short to permit them to ripen sufficiently. Towns, settlements, inhabitants, Sfc. \u2014 Kingston is situ ated at the mouth of a deep bay, at the north-eastern ex tremity of lake Ontario, containing about 250 houses, and 2,000 inhabitants. It contains a fort and barracks, and an English episcopalian church. The fort is of stone, and consists of a square with four bastions ; it was erected"], [752, "730 UPPER CANADA. by M. le Comte de Frontinac in 1672 : about 130 men are usually quartered in the barracks. Kingston is a place of very considerable trade, and has increased rapidly of late: all the goods brought up the St. Lawrence for the supply ofthe upper country are deposited here in stores, previous fo being shipped on board vessels suitable to the naviga tion of the lake ; and a vast quantity of furs are likewise here collected together, and sent in bateaux down the St. Lawrence. The principal merchants resident at Kingston are partners of old established houses at Montreal and Quebec, and are extremely hospitable to strangers, parti cularly British. The bay adjoining to Kingston affords good anchorage, and is the safest and most commodious harbour on lake Ontario. The bay of Great Sodus, on the south side of the lake, and that of Toronto, situated on the north side of the lake, nearly in the same meridian with Niagara, are said to be the next best to that of Kingston ; but the entrance iuto each of them is obstructed by sand banks, which cannot be crossed in rough weather without imminent danger. On the borders of the bay of Kingston there is a king's dock-yard, and another which is private property. Most of the British vessels of burden on lake Ontario are built in these yards. There is no regular market at Kingston, and the inha bitants are obliged to lay in a stock of fresh provisions in the best manner possible, and often with great difficulty. Fire-wood is brought in sledges, during the winter, from the banks ofthe river and the adjacent islands, and is sold remarkably cheap. Some schools are established in this district, bot not to any extent. The district of Kingston contains no paupers, and poor-rates are consequently un known to the inhabitants. Niagara town, or as it is sometimes called, Newark, is situated on the western bank of the Niagara river, about fifty yards from the water's edge. It contains about 120 houses, and from 5 to 600 inhabitants ; there is also a court house and gaol. The houses are chiefly built of wood ; those next the lake are rather poor, but at the upper end there are many excellent houses, occupied by the principal officers of government and others. The town commands a fine view of the lake and distant shores, and its situation is in every respect pleasing to the eye. From its standing on a spot of ground so much elevated above the level of the water, it might be supposed to be a very healthy place, but it is extremely unhealthy, as is also the vicinity, and almost every part of Upper Canada, the inhabitants being subject to intermittent and other fevers."], [753, "731 CANADA. On the margin of Niagara river, three-quarters of a mile from the town, there is a building called Navy Hall, erect- ed for the accommodation ofthe naval officers on the lake during the winter season, when their vessels are laid up. Opposite to it there is a spacious wharf, to protect the ves- sels from the ice ; and adjoining the wharf are very exten- sive stores belonging to the crown, and also to private persons. The fort of Niagara stauds immediately at the mouth of the river, on a point of land washed on one side by the river, and on the other by the lake : towards the water it is stockaded, and behind the stockade there is a large mound of earth, on the top of which are embrasures for guns ; qn the land side it is secured by several batteries and redoubts, and by parellel lines of fascines. The fort and out-works occupy about six acres of ground, and are generally occupied by about 100 men. Detroit is one of the most important places that was sur- rendered by the United States, and contains from 3 to 400 houses. It is built on an elevated bank of the river Nia- gara ; the streets all run parallel to the river, intersected at right angles, but they are unpaved, narrow, and dirty. The town is encircled with a strong stockade, through which two gates open to some extensive wharfs on the brink of the river, and two others to different sides of the town. On the western side there is a small square fort, defended by some small field pieces. This town is cele- brated for its commerce ; and the stores and shops are nearly as well supplied with fine cloth, linen, and every article of wearing apparel, as at New York or Philad.lphia. Provisions of all kinds are plentiful, particularly fish, which are caught in the river and adjacent lakes. The circum jacent country is remarkably flat, and none of the rivers have a fall sufficiently strong to turn a mill ; the inhabit- ants are therefore obliged to grind their corn by wind- mills. The soil about Detroit is remarkably rich, and yields an abundant supply of wheat and Indian corn. The climate is far more healthy than that in the vicinage of Niagara ; yet the summers are extremely bot, and inter- mittent fevers are here very common. There are several other small fort-towns or posts, such as Machillimachinack, &c. &c. but not of sufficient impor tance to command a particular description. History, Constitution, Government, Laws, Religion, <^c. of Upper and Lower Canada. \u2014 Canada was discovered by the English as early as 1497; but the first settlement in 5 A"], [754, "732 CANADA. it was made by the French, in 1608, who retained posses sion of it till 1760, when it was conquered by the British arms, and, by the treaty of Paris in 1763, ceded by France to the crown of England, under the government of which it has ever since continued. One of the most remarkable events which history records of this country, is the earthquake in 1663, which over whelmed a chain of mountains of free-stone, more than 300 miles long, and changed the immense tract into a plain ! From the time that Canada was ceded to Great Britain until the year 1774, the internal affairs of the province were regulated by the governor alone. In pursuance of the Quebec bill, which was then passed, a legislative coun cil was appointed by his majesty ; the number of members was limited to twenty-three. This council had full power to make all such ordinances and regulations as were thought expedient for the welfare of the province ; but it was prohibited from levying anyT taxes, except for the pur pose of repairing public buildings aud highways, or the like. Every ordinance was to be laid before the governor, sor his majesty's approbation, within six months from the time it was passed ; and no ordinance, imposing a greater punishment on any person or persons than a fine, or im prisonment for three months, was valid without his majes ty's assent, signified to the council by the governor. Thus were the affairs of the province regulated until the year 1791, when au act was passed in the British parlia ment, repealing so much of the Quebec Bill as related to the appointment of a council, and to the powers that had been granted to it ; and which established the present form of government. The country, at the same time, was divided into two distinct provinces ; the province of Lower Canada, and the province of Upper Canada. The former is the eastern part of the old province of Canada ; the latter, the western part, situated on the northern sides of the great lakes and rivers through which the boundary line runs that separates the British territories from those of the United States. The two provinces are divided from each other by a line, which runs north, 24\u00b0 west, commencing at Point au Bau det, in that part of the river St. Lawrence called Lake Francis, and continuing on from thence to the Utawas, or Grand River. The city of Quebec is the capital of the lower province ; the town of Niagara is often called the capital of the upper province. The executive power in each province is vested in the"], [755, "733 CANADA. governor, who has sor his advice an executive council ap- pointed by his majesty. The legislative power of each province is vested in the governor, a legislative council, and an assembly of the representatives of the people. Their acts, however, are subject to the controul of his ma- jesty, and in some particular cases to the controul of the British parliament. Bills are passed in the oouncil and in the assembly in a form somewhat similar to that in which bills are carried through the British houses of parliament ; they are then laid before the governor, who gives or withholds his assent, or reserves them for his majesty's pleasure. Such bills as he assents to are put in force immediately ; but he is bound to transmit a true copy of them to the king, who in council may declare his disallowance of them within two years from the time of their being received, in which case they become void. Such as are reserved for his majesty's assent are not to be put iu force until that is received, Moreover, every act ofthe assembly and council, which goes to repeal or vary the laws and regulations that were in existence at the time the present constitution was estab- lished in the country respecting tythes ; the appropriation Of land for the support ofa protestant clergy ; the consti- tuting and endowing of parsonages or rectories ; the right of presentation to the same, and the manner in which the incumbents shall hold them ; the enjoyment and exercise of any form or mode of worship ; the imposing of any bur- dens and disqualifications on account of the same; the rights of the clergy to recover their accustomed dues ; the imposing or granting of any farther due or emoluments to any ecclesiastics ; the establishment and discipline of the church of England ; the king's prerogative, touching the granting of waste lands ofthe crown within the province ; every such act, before it receives the royal assent, must be laid before both houses of parliament in Great Britain, and the king must not give his assent thereto until thirty days after tbe same has been laid before parliament ; and in case either house of parliament presents an address to the king to withhold his assent to any such act or acts, it can- not be given. By an act passed in the eighteenth year Of his present majesty's reign, the British parliament has also the power of making any regulations which may be found expedient, respecting the commerce and navigation of the province, and also of imposing import and export duties; but all such duties are to be applied solely to the use of the pro vince, as the council and assembly shall direct."], [756, "734 CANADA. The legislative council of Lower Canada consists of fif teen members; that of Upper Canada of seven. The num ber of the members in each province must never be less than this; but it may be increased whenever his majesty thinks fit. The counsellors are appoiuted for life, by an instrument under the great seal of the province, signed by the gover nor, who is invested with powers for that purpose by the king. No person can be a counsellor who is not twenty one years of age, nor any one who is not a natural-born subject, or who has not been naturalized according to act of parliament. Whenever his majesty thinks proper, he may confer on any persons hereditary titles of honour, with a right an nexed to them of being summoned to sit in this council, which right the heir may claim at the age of twenty-one ; the right, however, cannot be acknowledged if the heir has been absent from the province without leave of his majesty, signified to the council by the governor, for four years together, between tbe time of his succeeding to tbe right and the time of his demanding it. The right is for feited also, if the heir takes an oath of allegiance to any foreign power before he demands it, unless his majesty, by an instrument under the great seal ofthe province, should decree to the contrary. Isa counsellor, after having taken his seat, absent him self from the province for two years successively, without leave from his majesty, signified to the council by the go vernor, his seat is also thereby vacated. All hereditary rights, however, of sittine: in council, so forfeited, are only to be suspended during the life of the defaulters, and on their death they descend with the titles to the next heirs. In cases of treason, both the title and right of sitting in the council are extinguished. All questions concerning the right of being summoned to the council are to be determined by the council ; but an appeal may be had from their decision to his majesty in his parliament of Great Britain. The governor has the power of appointing and remov iug the speaker ofthe council. The assembly of Lower Canada consists of fifty members, and that of Upper Canada of sixteen ; neither assembly is ever to consist of a less number. The members for districts, circles, or counties, are cho sen by a majority of the votes of such persons as are pos sessed of lands or tenements in freehold, in fief, in boture,"], [757, "735 CANADA. or by certificate derived under the authority ofthe gover nor and council of Quebec, of the yearly value of forty shillings, clear of all rents, charges, &c. The members for towns or townships are chosen by a majority of the votes of such persons as possess houses and lands for their own use, ofthe yearly value of five pounds sterling, or as have resided in the town or township for oue year, and paid a rent for a house during the time, at the rate of ten pounds yearly. No person is eligible to serve as a member ofthe assem bly, who is a member of the legislative council, or a minis ter, priest, ecclesiastic, or religious personage of the church of England, Rome, or of any other church. No person is qualified to vote or serve, who is not twenty one years osage ; nor any person, not a natural-born sub ject, or who has not been naturalized, either by law or conquest ; nor any one who has been attainted of treason in any court in his majesty's dominions, or who has been disqualified by an act of assembly or council. Every voter, if called upon, must take an oath, either in French or English, that he is of age; that he is qualified to vote according to law ; and that he has not voted before at that election. The governor has the power of appointing the place of session, and of calling together, of proroguing, and of dis solving the assembly. Tbe assembly is not to last longer than four years, but it may be dissolved sooner. The governor is bound to call it at least once in each year. The oath ofa member, on taking his seat, is comprised in a few words : he promises to bear true allegiance to the king, as lawful sovereign of Great Britain, and the pro vince of Canada dependent upon it ; to defend him against all traitorous conspiracies and attempts, wbich he may at any time be acquainted with ; all which he promises with out mental evasion, reservation, or equivocation, at the same time renouncing all pardons and dispensations from any person or power whatsoever, The governors ofthe two provinces are totally indepen dent of each other in their civil capacity; in military affairs, the governor of the lower province takes prece dence, as he is usually created captain-general of his ma jesty's forces in North America. The present system of judicature in each province was established by the Quebec Bill of 1774. By this bill it was enacted, that all persons in the country should be entitled to hold their lands or possessions in the same manner as"], [758, "736 CANADA. before the conquest, according to the laws and usages then existing in Canada; and that all controversies relative to property or civil rights should also be determined by the same laws and usages. These old laws and usages, how ever, were not to extend to the lands which might there after be granted by his Britannic majesty in free and com mon socage: here English laws were to be in full force ; so that the English inhabitants, who have settled for the most part on new lands, aro not subject to the controul of these old French laws, that were existing in Canada when the country was conquered \u2014 except a dispute concerning property or civil rights should arise between any of them and the French inhabitants, in which case the matter is to be determined by the French laws. Every friend to cjv il liberty would wish to see these laws abolished, for they weigh very unequally in favour of the rich and of the poor; but as long as the French inhabitants remain so wedded as they are at present to old customs, there is little hope of seeing any alteration of this nature take place. At the same time that the French laws were suffered by the Que bec bill to exist, in order to conciliate the affections ofthe French inhabitants, who were attached to them, the cri minal law of England was established throughout every part of the country ; \" and this was one of the happiest circumstances,\" as the Abbe Raynal observes, \u2022\u00ab that Ca nada could experience ; as deliberate, rational, public trials took place of the impenetrable mysterious transac tions of a cruel inquisition; and as a tribunal, that had theretofore been dreadful and sanguinary, was filled with humane judges, more disposed to acknowledge innocence than to suppose criminality.\" The governor, the lieutenant-governor, or the person administering the government, the members of the execu tive council, the chief justiee of the province, and the judges ofthe court of king's bench, or any five of them, form a eourt of appeal, the judges however excepted of that district from whence the appeal is made. From she decision of this court an appeal may be had in certain cases to the king in council. Every religion is tolerated, in the fullest extent of the word, in both provinces ; and no disqualifications are im posed on any persons on account of their religioosopinions. The Roman Catholic religion is that of a great majority of the inhabitants ; and by the Quebec bill of 1774, the eccle siastics of that persuasion are empowered by law to recover all the daes which, previous to that period, they were ac \u00a7_Jtt__U_l to .eceive, as fr-ell as tithes, tbat is, from th\u00ab"], [759, "737 CANADA. Roman catholic inhabitants; but they cannot exact any dues or tithes from Protestants, although formerly such lands might have been subjected to dues and tithes for the support of the Roman caiholic church. The dues and tithes from off these lands arc still, however, to be paid ; but they are to be paid by persons appointed by the gover nor, and tbe amount of them is to be reserved, in the hands of his majesty's receiver-general, for the support of the protestant clergy actually residing in the province. By the act of the year 1791, it was ordained, that the governor should allot out of all lands belonging to the crown, which should be granted after that period, one seventh for the benefit of a protestant clergy, to be solely applicable to their use; and all such allotments must be particularly specified in every grant of waste lands, other wise the grant is void. With the advice ofthe executive council, the governor is authorised to constitute or erect parsonages or rectories, and to endow them out of these appropriations, and to present incumbents to them, ordained according to the rites ofthe church of England ; which incumbents are to perform the same, duties, and to hold their parsonages or rectories in the same manner as incumbents of the church of England do in that country. The clergy of the church of England in both provinces, consists at present of twenty persons only, including the bishop of Quebec ; that of the church of Rome, however, consists of no less than one hundred and twenty-six ; viz. a bishop who takes his title from Quebec, his \"coad juteur elu,\" who is bishop of Canathe, three vicars-general, and one hundred and sixteen curates and missionaries, all of whom are resident in the lower province, except five curates and missionaries. The number ofthe dissenting clergy, in both provinces, is considerably smaller, lhan that of tbe clergy of the church of England. The expences ofthe civil list iu Lower Canada are esti mated at \u00a320,000 sterling per annum, one half of which is defrayed by Great Britain, and the remainder by the pro vince, out ofthe duties paid on the importation of certain articles. The expense of the civil list in Upper Canada is considerably less ; perhaps not so much as one-fourth of that of tlie lower proviuce. The military establishment iu both provinces, together with the repairs of fortifications, &c. are computed to cost Great Britain annually \u00a3100,000 sterling. The presents distributed amongst th\u00bb Indians, and the"], [760, "738 CANADA. salaries paid to the different officers in the Indian depart- ment, are estimated at \u00a3100,000 sterling more, annually.

The soil ofthe country is well adapted to the growth of hemp, aud great pains have been taken to introduce the culture of it. Hand-bills, explaining the manner in which it can be raised to the best advantage, have been from time to time assiduously circulated amongst the farmers, and posted up at all the public houses: it has been a difficult matter, however, to put the French Canadians out of their old ways, so that, comparatively speaking, very little hemp has hitherto been grown in Canada. Domestic manufactures are carried on in most parts of Canada, consisting of linen and of coarse woollen cloths; but by far the greater part of these articles used in the country is imported from Great Britain. The exports from Canada consist of furs and pelts in immense quantities; of wheat, flour, flax-seed, pot-ash, timber, staves, and lumber of all sorts ; dried fish, oil, gin seng, and various medicinal drugs. Tbe trade between Canada and Great Britain employs, it is said, about twelve thousand tons of shipping annually. General Remarks, &c. \u2014 About five-sixths of the inha bitants of Lower Canada are of French extraction, the bulk of whom are peasants, living upon the lands of the seignors. Among the English inhabitants devoted to agriculture, but few, however, are to be fonnd occupying land under seig nors, notwithstanding that several of tbe seigniories have fallen into the hands of Englishmen ; the great majority of them hold the lands which they cultivate by virtue of certificates from the governor. The seigniors, both French and English, live in a plain simple style ; for although the seigniories in general are extensive, but few of them afford a very large income to tbe proprietors. The revenues of a seigniory arise from certain fines levied upon the vassals ; and which it is to be hoped will in time be entirely abo lished, as the vassal is sometimes compelled to pay fines, that in strict justice ought not to be demanded."], [763, "741 APPEXntX.. APPENDIX. ************ .Y-fy -fy*'****** OK THE AMERICAN CHARACTER. Un the early part of this Work, a short outline of the American character was attempted; but, as the following outlines are original, and may not be uninteresting te the generality of readers, they are given without any other apology for the seeming repetition :\u2014 Notwithstanding the important differences of climate, habits of life, and religion, the character ofthe Americans throughout the Union present a feature of similitude coun- tervailing all these. This feature is government. Politi- cal institutions have in other countries a feeble and secon- dary influence : the duties of a subject are, for the most part, passive ; those of the American citizen are active, and perpetually acting ; and as they operate equally on every member of society, their general controul over the whole community must, in most instances, exceed that of any partial habit or opinion. The common qualities which may be said to be generated by this influence, are, intelligence, or a quick perception of utility, both general and individual ; hence their attach- ment to freedom, and to every species of improvement, both public and private : energy, and perseverance in car- rying their plans into effect ; qualities in fact deducible from the former : gravity of manner and deportment, be- cause they are habitually occupied upon matters of deep interest: taciturnity, wbich is the offspring of thought. They appear deficient in imagination or the poetry of life, because all its realities are at their disposal. They seem to have little sympathy, because their social system does not compel them to suffer. Oppression engenders pity ; disease and death require only resignation. But besides these general features, which may be con- sidered as common to the whole mass of American citizens ; each grand division of tbe Union has its own peculiar cha- racteristics. By grand divisions is meant, 1. The New England States: 2. The Central; 3. The Southern; and 4. The States to the west of the Alleghanies. The following is an attempt to delineate the peculiar character ofthe inhabitants of each division. Character of the inhabitants of New England.\u2014 The in-"], [764, "742 APPENDIX. habitants of New England have been very aptly termed the Scotchmen of the United States ; patient, industrious, frugal, enterprising, and intelligent-. Intent upon gain, making it the master-spring of all their actions, it cannot be denied but that they are frequently knavish, mean, and avaricious. But the New Englanders should be seen at home to be correctly judged of; they then appear a sober, shrewd, and well-informed people, possessing a great de^ gree of genuine native urbanity of manners. Fraught with a spirit of commercial enterprise, they are to be found in all parts ofthe mercantile world. Calvinism, rigid, uncompromising Calvinism, is an here ditary feature in the character of the New Englanders, but it has lost a considerable portion of its rigidity with the present race. Yet in many parts of the country dancing is held to be an abomination, as well as many other social enjoyments. This appears to be a matter of regret, inas much as the natural severity of their character evidently requires rather to be teoipered by innocent recreations, than stiffened by gloomy creeds, and the uncongenial doc trines of exclusive salvation. A humourous explanation of the term Yankie, generally applied to the New Englanders, has been given by Knick erbocker, i.p. 178. \u2014 \" The first settlers of New England,\" says he, \" were the Puritans, and other sectaries, who, per secuted and buffeted at home, embarked for the wilderness of America, where they might enjoy unmolested the ines timable luxury of talking. No sooner did they laud upon this loquacious soil, than as if they had caught the disease from the climate, they all lifted up their voices at once^ and for the space of one whole year did keep up such a joyful clamour, that we are told, they frightened every bird and beast out of the neighbourhood, and so completely dumb-sounded certain fish, which abound on their coast, that they have been called ' dumb-fish' ever since. The simple aborigines of the land for a while contemplated these strange folk iu utter astonishment, but discovering that they wielded harmless, though noisy weapons, and were a lively, ingenious, good-humoured race of men, they became very friendly and sociable, and gave them the name of Yan-kies, which, in the Mais-Tchsuaeg (or Mas igachusett) language signifies ' silent men ;' a waggish ap pellation since shortened into the familiar epithet of Yankies, wheih they retain unto the present day.\" Nor hare they retained a barren epithet, but are still eminent for the facility with which they engage in conversation."], [765, "APPENDIX. 743 General character of the people in the Centred States.\u2014* There is no portion of the Union which contains mor\u00a9 enlightened individuals, more useful institutions, or a stronger spirit of literary and scientific improvement, than the cities of New York and Philadelphia; but there are several reasons which prevent the citizens of the Central States from acquiring a general character, as strongly marked as is that of the Eastern. They are composed of several heterogeneous bodies. The ancient Dutch race still exists, with many of its primitive habits, towards the centre of the state of New York ; towards the north and west, its population consists chiefly of New Englanders. A large portion of Pennsylvania is inhabited by Germans, who are still unacquainted with the English language, and are consequently rather a social circle existing within the State, than a portion of the community amalgamating with if. The Quakers, too, are a body whose distinctive habits necessarily operate against the formation of a general cha racter, because they are stronger than any general causes by which such a character is engendered. These circum stances are hardly, however, felt as disadvantages; in some respects, they are probably the contrary. As citizens, the Dutch and Germans are peaceable and industrious, though not very enlightened; the New Eng landers introduce the best qualities of their characters: tho Quakers are intelligent and humane. Adventurers from all countries constitute the most unsound part of the popu lation, and are likely to give a stranger an unfavourable opiuion ofthe whole ; in other respects, the Central States seem those in which foreigners will find the tone of man ners, and spirit of society, most accommodating and easy. Characteristic features of the Southern Stales' people. \u2014 It is impossible to consider the character of the Southern States, without again adverting to the pernicious effects of slavery. Land cultivated by slaves requires a considerable capital, and will therefore be divided among a small num ber of proprietors. He who commands the sweat of others, will be little inclined to toil himself; the inclination will diminish with the necessity. Dissipation is the resource of the unoccupied, and ill-instructed. Whilst the political effects of slavery are pernicious to the citizen, its moral effects are still more fatal to the man : the whole commerce between master and slave is a perpetual exercise of she most boisterous passions : the most unremitting despotism on the one part, and degrading submissions on the other. Their children see this, and learn to imitate it, sor man is an imitative animal : the parent storms, the child looks on,"], [766, "744 APPENDIX. catches the lineaments of wrath, puts on the same airs, gives loose to the worst of passions, and thus nursed, edu- cated, and daily exercised in tyranny, cannot but be stamped by it with odious peculiarities. The man must be a prodigy who can retain his morals and manners unde- praved by such circumstances. The manners ofthe lower classes are consequently bru- tal and depraved. Those ofthe upper classes are frequently arrogant and assuming : unused to restraint or contradic- tion of any kind, they are necessarily quarrelsome ; and in their quarrels, the native ferocity of their hearts breaks out. Duelling is not only in general vogue and fashion, but practised with circumstances of peculiar vindictiveness. The learned and mercantile professions have little direct interest in the slave system, and are therefore less infected by its contagion ; but these are rare exceptions, stars in darkness, which shine, more sensibly to mark the deep shadows of the opposite extreme, where the contrast is. strong, perpetual, and disgusting. Delineation of the Western States' inhabitants.\u2014 The inhabitants of Kentucky are, or at least were (for iu Ame rica the wheel of society turns so swiftly, that 20 years work the changes of a century) considered as the Irish men ofthe United States: that is to say, a similar state of society had produced, in a certain degree, similar manners. The Kentuckians are disposed to conviviality and social intercourse ; though their board is seldom spread by the graces, or their festivity restricted within the boundaries of temperance. They are in fact hospitable and open heart ed, but boisterous, and addicted |to those vulgar amuse ments so common in all countries, as long as man knew no pleasure more refined than the alternate excitement and dissipation of his animal spirits by feats of physical strength, and coarse debauchery. To a certain extent, therefore, there are points of similitude betwixt the Kentucky farmers and the Irish gentry, but there was always this point of distinction, \u2014 in Kentucky, leisure and abundance belong to every man who will work for them; in Ireland, they appertain only to the few for whom the many work. But the Western States have of late years become manu facturing districts : towns have grown up rapidly, and the luxuries of social intercourse are scarcely less understood in Lexington than in New York ; manners must therefore have undergone a considerable change, and those peculi arities of character, which were once supposed to mark Kentuckians, must probably now be sought among the more recent inhabitants of Tenessee or Indiana."], [767, "745 APPENDIX. It may safely be affirmed, that between the Alleganie9 and the Missouri, every degree of civilization is to be met with which shades the character of social man, from a state of considerable luxury and refinement, until on the very verge of the pale, he almost ceases to be gregarious, and attaches himself to a life of savage independence. There are settlers, if they may be so called, who are continually pushing forward, abandoning their recent improvements n_ fast as neighbourhood overtakes them, and plunging deeper into primeval wildernesses. a****-**********^*^^**^******* r+. OF AMERICAN EMIGRATION It seems A very simple process to go and settle in a ses- sile country, where land may be procured for two dollars the acre ; a glance, however, over an uncleared, and hea- vily-timbered tract, is sufficient, not only to correct our notions of the facility of the enterprise, but to render it astonishing, that men are found sufficiently venturesome and enduring to undertake the task. The stoutest labourer might well shrink at the prospect, but hope and freedom brace both soul and sinews : there is something almost poetical in the confidence and hardihood of sucb under- takings. To enlightened industry, this virgin continent offers un- diminished resources; nor where success is in prospect will the American turn his foot aside, however rugged the path to it ; with his axe on his shoulder, his family and stock in a light waggon, he plunges info forests which have never heard the woodman's stroke, clears a space sufficient for his dwelling, and first year's consumption, and gradually converts the lonely wilderness into a flou- rishing farm. This almost national genius, has been ably delineated by Talleyrand, Volney, and other writers; and a humorous, but faithful account ofthe American vis ' migratoria, is given by Knickerbocker, l,c. vii. \u2014 \"The most prominent habit is a certain rambling propensity, with which, like the sons of Ishmael, they seem to have been gifted by heaven, and which perpetually goads them on, to shift their residence from place to place, so that tJiey are in a constant state of migration ; tarrying awhile here and there, clearing lands for other people to enjoy, building houses for others to inhabit, and in a manner, may be considered the wandering Arab of America. His first thought on coming to tbe years of manhood, is to settle himself in the world, which means nothing more or less,"], [768, "746 APPENDIX. than to begin his rambles ; to this end, he takes unto him* self for a wife, some dashing country heiress, that is to say, a buxom rosy cheeked wench, passing rich in red ribands, glass beads, and mock tortoise-shell combs, with a white gown aud Morocco shoes, for Sunday, and deeply skilled in the mystery of making apple sweetmeats, long sauce, and pumpkin pie. Having thus provided himself, like a true pedlar, with a heavy knapsack, wherewith to regale his shoulders through the journey of life, he literally sets out on the peregrination. His whole family, household furniture and farming utensils, are hoisted into a covered cart; his own and his wife's wardrobe packed up in a fir kin ; which done, he shoulders his axe, takes staff in hand, and trudges off to the woods, as confident of the protec tion of Providence, and relying as cheerfully upon his own resources as ever did a patriarch of yore, when he jour neyed into a strange country of the Gentiles. Having buried himself in the wilderness, he builds himself a log hut, clears away a corn-field and potatoe patch; and Pro vidence smiling upon his labours, is soon surrounded by a snug farm, and some half-a-score of flaxen-headed urchins, who by their size, seem to have sprung all at once out of the earth, like a crop of toad-stools.\" The pale of civilized life widens daily, aud plainly inti mates to the indignant and retiring Indian, that it will finally know no limit but the Pacific. Cultivators have begun to discover the superiority of the soil, westward of the Alleghany ridges : the tide of emigration is accordingly turned to the neighbourhood ofthe Ohio. Settlements are creeping along the Missouri, and the mouth of the Colum bia is already designated to connect the Asiatic with the European commerce of the States. Such is the growth, and such the projects of this trans atlantic republic, great in extent of territory, in an active and well-informed population ; but above all, in a free government, wbich not only leaves individual talent un fettered, but calls it into life by all the incitements of am bition most grateful to the human mind."], [769, "__ si m \u00ae s_ A Page.
