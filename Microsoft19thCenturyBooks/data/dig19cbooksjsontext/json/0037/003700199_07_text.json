The volume of the History of Scotland now published embraces the eventful period between the marriage of Mary to Darnley, and the conclusion of the civil war, in 1572, a portion of our national an nals which has been so deformed by con troversy, that there is scarcely a single event in it of any importance, which has not been questioned, or distorted to suit the peculiar views of the antagonists or defenders of the Queen of Scots. Under these circumstances, the Author, without adopting any preconceived no tions, or espousing any favorite theory, has endeavoured to separate the truth from the tissue of fiction, passion, and VOL.

Queen summoned her subjects to meet her in arms in the capital.1 Her safety lay in promptitude and decision ; she resolved to anticipate the movements of her opponents before it was possible for them to receive succour from England ; and in this her efforts were eminently successful. Three days after her marriage, Murray was commanded to appear at court, under the penalty of being proclaimed a rebel, and having failed, he was \" put to the horn,\" as it was termed, that is, his life and estates were declared forfeited to the laws ; upon which Randolph, in a letter addressed to the Queen of England, implored her to strengthen the hands of the English party in Scotland, and to save them from utter ruin.2 He wrote also to the Earl of Bed ford, an old and tried friend of Murray, urging him to use his influence to procure instant assistance, and assuring him, that if the English borderers could be let loose at this crisis, so as to keep their Scot tish neighbours employed, the Queen and Darnley would be reduced to great distress.3 His letters to Elizabeth contained an alarming picture of affairs in Scotland.

The Scot tish queen, convinced that Murray's sole purpose was to recover the power which he had lost, allowed her enemies no time to concentrate their strength, but at the head of a force which defied opposition, compelled them to fly from Stirling to Glasgow, and from Glasgow to Argyle.4 She then returned to Edinburgh, where Tamworth had arrived, and this envoy being admitted to an audience, was received by Mary with a spirit for which he seems not to have been prepared.3 In the letter which Elizabeth sent to this prin cess, she had affected to treat with contempt her pretensions to the English throne, and her prac tices with foreign powers, but Mary could express 1 MS.

After de fending her marriage, and remonstrating against the uncalled-for interference of Elizabeth, she turned to the subject of the succession. I am not, said she, so lowly born, nor yet have I such small alliances abroad, that if compelled by your mistress to enter into ' practices ' with foreign powers, she shall find them of such small account as she believes. The place which I fill in relation to the succession to the Crown of England, is no vain or imaginary one, and by God's grace, it shall appear to the world, that my designs and consul tations shall prove as substantial as those which at any time my neighbours have taken in hand.1 But although she repelled Elizabeth's haughty and sarcastic insinuations, Mary was sincerely desirous of peace. To promote this, she promised Randolph all that could justly be required. She could not consent indeed to renounce her title to a throne to which she held her claim to be undoubted, but she was ready to come under the most solemn obligation that neither she nor her husband should attempt any thing to the prejudice of the English queen or of her issue, and that whenever God called them to the possession of their right in England, no alter ation should be made in the religion, laws, or liber ties, of that ancient kingdom. In return, she in sisted on the performance of two conditions, the 1 MS. St. P. Off.

Without waiting therefore for any further communi cation from England, she deemed it proper to take a determined step. The English ambassador was informed that he must either promise upon his honour to renounce all intercourse with her rebels, or be put under the charge of those who should take care to detect and restrain his practices : Ran dolph's reply to the Privy Council was more a defi ance than an answer. \" I will promise nothing,\" said he, \" either on honour, honesty, word, or writing, and as for guards to attend me, they shall fare full ill, unless stronger and better armed than my own servants.\" Lethington, the secretary, then proposed that he should retire to Berwick, but this, too, he peremptorily refused. \" Wheresoever 1 MS.

If I am driven from this, it is easy to see what mind is borne to my sovereign.\"1 His insolence encou raged Tamworth to equal arrogance : he refused to give Darnley the royal title, and declined ac cepting a passport, because it bore his signature as king : but this ill judged presumption cost him dear. On his way home, a hint having been given to the borderers, he was waylaid, maltreated, and carried a prisoner to Hume Castle, from which he addressed a letter to Cecil, detailing his sorrowful adventure.8 In the meantime Ehzabeth amused the insurgent barons by large promises, and small pecuniary ad vances, and thus encouraged, Murray, the duke, and Glencairn, at the head of a thousand men, ad vanced to Edinburgh, which they entered on the last day of August.3 The movement proved to be ill judged, and premature.

He was instructed to require the immediate assist ance of three thousand men, and the presence of some ships of war in the Firth.* With these exorbitant demands Elizabeth could not possibly have complied unless she had been prepared to rush into open war : she was now con vinced that Randolph had misled or deceived her, by overrating the strength of the insurgents.

Before a com pany of horse, pikes, or bowmen, could have reached the borders, the Scottish queen had swept with her forces through Fife, inflicted chastisement on the Laird of Grange and other barons who had joined the rebels, levied a heavy fine on the towns of Dundee and St. Andrew's, seized Castle Campbell, and prepared, at the head of an army which ren dered opposition fruitless, to attack the rebel lords at Dumfries. So keen was she in the pursuit, that she rode with pistols at her saddle bow, and declared to Randolph, that she would rather peril her crown, than lose her revenge.3 At this crisis, the Earl of Bothwell returned from 1 The Queen to Bedford, Sep. 12, 1565.

Aware that the arrival of such partizans would be followed by the most determined measures, the rebel lords made a last effort to alarm Elizabeth on the subject of religion.

As to the Earl of Murray, he was hated, they said, because he would not support Riccio in his abuses, whilst a stranger (meaning Darnley) , the subject of another realm, had intruded himself into the state, and claimed the name and authority of a king, without their consent, against all order that ever was used in this realm; and now, because they desired redress of these great enormities, they were persecuted as traitors and enemies to the commonwealth.1 Although in some parts exaggerated, these fears and accusations were not without foundation.

This foreigner, who was a Milanese, had come to Scotland in the train of Moret, the Savoy ambassador, and his ambition was at first satisfied with the humble office of a singer in the queen's band, but being well educated, he was occasionally employed in other matters, and on the dismissal of Raulet, her French secretary, 1 Keith, p. 316. 2 Gonzalez Apuntamientos para la Historia del Rey Fehpe II., p. 312, pubhshed in vol. vh. of the Memoirs of the Historical Society of Madrid.

Mary rewarded his talent with the vacant office. But when betrayed, as she had repeatedly been by her own nobility, to whom office, but not fidelity, was transmitted by birth, it was not won derful that the queen employed those whom she could better trust, and, on the whole, the arguments of the insurgents produced little effect upon Eliza beth. She was convinced of the power and popu larity of the Scottish queen ; the feebleness of Mur ray and his associates, whom she had bribed into rebellion, was proved beyond a doubt, and the moment this was discovered, they were abandoned to their fate, without pity or remorse. True to her wonted dissimulation in all state policy, she assured them that she still favoured their enterprise, and was moved by their distress, but no remonstrances of Murray, who loudly declared that desertion was ruin, could extort from her either money or troops.1 At this moment, Monsieur de Mauvissiere, better known as the Sieur de Castelnau, was in England, whither he had been sent by his master, the French king, to accomplish, if possible, a reconciliation between Mary and Elizabeth. By the advice of Cecil, Mauvissiere and Cockburn, the last a creature of this minister, and known to Mary as an archer in the Scottish guard, repaired to Scotland, and made an attempt to procure a pardon for Murray and his associates.

On advancing at the head of her army, Lord Maxwell, the most powerful baron in these quarters, hastened to make his submission, and Murray, with the chiefs of his faction, fled in terror to Carlisle.2 From this city the Scottish earl addressed a letter of remonstrance to Cecil, imploring his mis tress to save them from the wreck of \" honour, conscience, and estate.\" On the other hand, Mary, a few days before, had written in spirited terms to Elizabeth. It had been reported she said, much to her astonishment, that her sister of England in tended to protect her rebellious subjects who had fled to the borders. She declared her unwilling ness to give credit to such tales, but should they prove true, should she make common cause with such traitors, she avowed her resolution to de nounce such wrongful dealings to all the foreign princes who were her allies. The English queen was alarmed. The French and Spanish ambassa dors took Mary's part, and accused Elizabeth, in 1 MS. Letter. St. P. Off., Edinburgh.

Murray, by this time, was travelling to the Eng lish Court, and Elizabeth found herself in an awkward predicament; but it was necessary to take immediate measures, and those which she adopted strongly marked her character ; an envoy was hurried off to command the Scottish earl and his friends, on pain of her displeasure, to remain at a distance. This was the public message in tended to vindicate her fair dealing to the world. The messenger encountered and stopped Murray at Ware : here the earl remained, and here he soon received a secret message, permitting him to come forward.1 He obeyed, and was admitted into the presence of the English queen, but it was to be made an actor in a scene which overwhelmed him with confusion. She had summoned the French and Spanish ambassadors to be present. Murray and the Abbot of Kilwinning entered the apartment, fell upon their knees, and implored her intercession with the queen, their mistress. \"I am astonished,\" said Elizabeth, \" that you have dared without warn ing to come before me ; are you not branded as rebels * MS.

Turning in proud triumph to the foreign ambas- sadors, she bade them mark his words, and then, with an expression of anger and contempt, she addressed Murray and the Abbot of Killwinning, still on their knees before her : \u2014 \" It is well,\" said she, \" that you have told the truth : for neither did I, nor any one else in my name, ever encourage you in your unnatural rebellion against your sove- reign, nor, to be mistress of a world, could I main- tain any subject in disobedience to his prince : it might move God to punish me by a similar trouble in my own realm : \u2014 but as for you two, ye are un worthy traitors, and I command you instantly to leave my presence.\"2 The earl and his friend were then ignomini- 1 MS.

The influence of this Milanese adventurer had been gradually increasing. At this moment Mait land of Lethington, the secretary of state, was sus pected of having been nearly connected with the re bellion of Murray,1 and, as a trustworthy servant was a prize rarely to be found, the queen began to consult her French secretary in affairs of secresy and moment. The step was an imprudent one, and soon attended with the worst effects. It roused the jealousy of the king, a weak and suspicious youth, who deemed it an affront that a stranger of low origin should presume to interfere in state affairs ; and it turned Riccio's head, who began to assume, in his dress, equipage, and establishment, a foolish state totally unsuited to his rank.2 In the mean time, his influence was great, and Murray bespoke his good offices by the present of a rich diamond, with a letter soliciting his assistance.3 Had Mary been left to herself, there is little doubt that her rebels would have been pardoned.

This was the arrival of two gentlemen, de Rambouillet and Clernau, on a mission from the French court. Their message was outwardly one of mere ceremony, to invest the young king with the order of St. Michael, but amid the festivi ties attendant on the installation, a more import ant and secret communication took place. Clernau, the special envoy of the Cardinal Lorraine, and Thornton, a messenger from Beaton, the Scottish ambassador in France, who had come to court about the same time, informed Mary of the coali tion which had been concluded between France, Spain, and the Emperor, for the destruction of the Protestant cause in Europe. It was a design worthy of the dark and unscrupulous politicians by whom it had been planned \u2014 Catherine of Me dicis, and the Duke of Alva. In the summer of the preceding year, the queen dowager of France and Alva had met at Bayonne, during a progress, in which she conducted her youthful son and so vereign, Charles IX., through the southern pro vinces of his kingdom. And there, whilst the court was dissolved in pleasure, those secret conferences were held which issued in the resolution that toleration must be at an end, and that the only safety for the Roman Catholic faith was the extermination of its enemies.1 1 Keith, p. 325, Mezerai Abrege Chronologique de L'Histoire de"], [45, "1565 19 MARY Thornton accordingly brought from the Cardinal Lorraine the \" Band \" or League which had been drawn up on this occasion ; it was whispered that some of her friends in England were parties to it, and Mary was strongly urged to become a member of the coalition. Her intention of pardoning Murray and her other rebels was at the same time opposed by these foreign envoys, with the utmost earnest ness. It was represented as her only safe policy to crush, while she had it in her power, that busy Protestant faction which had been so long encou raged, and was even at this moment secretly sup ported by Elizabeth, and to join that sacred League, to which she was united, as well by the bonds of a mutual faith, as by those of blood and affection. If she adopted this method, it was argued, her authority within her realm would be placed upon a secure foundation ; if she neglected it, her mis fortunes, however complicated they had already been, were only in their commencement. Riccio, who at this moment possessed much in fluence, and was on good grounds suspected to be a pensioner of Rome, seconded these views with all his power. On the other hand she did not want advisers on the side of wisdom and mercy.

But now the entreaties of her uncle the cardinal, the advice of her ambassador, the prejudices of her education, and the intolerance of the Protestants, and of Elizabeth, by whom she had been so often deceived, all united to influence her decision, and overmaster her better judgment. In an evil hour she signed the League, and determined to hurry on the parliament for the forfeiture of the rebels. This may, I think, be regarded as one of the most fatal errors of her life ; and it proved the source of all her future misfortunes. She united herself to a bigotted and unprincipled association, which, under the mask of defending the truth, offered an outrage to the plainest precepts of the Gospel. She imagined herself a supporter of the Catholic Church, when she was giving her sanction to one of the worst corruptions of Romanism ; and she was destined to reap the consequences of such a step in all their protracted bitterness. The moment the queen's resolution was known, it blasted the hopes of Murray, and threw him and all Mary's enemies upon desperate courses. If the Estates were allowed to meet, the consequence to them was ruin; if the councillors continued un changed, and Riccio's advice was followed, it was Sir J.

Such being the crisis, it was, at once, determined that the meeting of parliament should be arrested, the government of the queen and her ministers overturned ; and that, to effect this, Riccio must be murdered. This last atrocious expedient was no new idea, for the seeds of an unformed conspiracy against the foreign favorite, had been sown some time before ; and of this Murray's friends now availed themselves, artfully uniting the two plots into one, the object of which was the return of Murray, the dethronement of the queen, and the re-establishment of the Protestant leaders in the power which they had lost. The origin, growth, and subsequent combination, of these two conspiracies have never yet been un derstood, although they can be distinctly traced. The first plot for the death of Riccio was, strange to say, formed by no less personages than the young king and his father, the Earl of Lennox. It had its rise in the jealousy and ambition of these unprincipled men, and the imprudent conduct of Mary. In the early ardour of her affection, the queen had promised Darnley the crown matrimonial, by which was meant an equal share with herself in the government ; but after a few months she had the misery to discover, that her love had been thrown away upon a husband whom it was impossible for her to treat with con fidence or respect. He was fickle, proud, and sus-"], [48, "22 1565. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. picious ; ambitious of power, yeti ncapable of busi ness, and the easy dupe of every crafty or interested companion whom he met. It became necessary for Mary to draw back from her first promise. This led to coldness, to reproaches, soon to an ab solute estrangement ; even in public he treated her with harshness ; he became addicted to low dissi pation,1 forsook her company, and threw himself into the hands of her enemies. They persuaded him that Riccio was the sole author of those measures which had deprived him of his due share in the government. But this was not all, Darnley had the folly to become the dupe of a more absurd delusion. He became jealous of the Italian se cretary ; he believed that he had supplanted him in the affections of the queen ; he went so far as to assert that he had dishonoured his bed, and in a furious state of mind sent his cousin George Douglas to implore Lord Ruthven, in whom he had great confidence, to assist him against \" the villain David.\"2 Ruthven was at this moment confined to bed by a dangerous sick ness, which might have been supposed to unfit him for such desperate projects. He was, as he himself informs us, \" scarcely able to walk twice the length of his chamber ;\" yet he consented to engage in the murder, and Darnley was sworn to keep all 1 Drury to Cecil, 16th Feb. 1565-6.

He informed him that the king and his father, Lennox, were determined to murder Riccio ; that within ten days the deed would be done ; that, as to the queen, the crown would be torn from her whose dishonour was discovered ; and that still darker designs were meditated against her person, which he did not dare to commit to writing. From his letter, which is very long, I must give this im portant passage. \" I know now for certain,\" said he, \" that this queen repenteth her marriage ; that she hateth him (Darnley) and all his kin.

Under his father, the noted George Douglas, he had been early familiarized with in trigue. He hated Riccio, and dreaded the assembling of parliament almost as much as Murray, from a report that he was to be deprived of certain crown lands, which had been improperly obtained, and to lose the seals as chancellor.3 Morton, too, was the personal friend of Murray ; like him he belonged to copies were printed.

His first endeavour was to strengthen their hands by procuring the co-operation of the party of the reformed church ; his next, to follow out Ruthven's idea, by drawing in Murray, and making the plot the means of his return to power ; his last to se cure the countenance and support of Elizabeth and her chief ministers, Cecil and Leicester. In all this he succeeded. The consent and assist ance of the leading Protestant barons, was soon gained, and to neutralize any opposition on the part of their chief ministers was not found a difficult mat ter.1 They were in the deepest alarm at this moment. It was known that Mary had signed the Popish League ; it was believed that Riccio corresponded with Rome, and there was no doubt that some mea sures for the restoration of the Roman Catholic re ligion were in preparation, and only waited for the parliament to be carried into execution.2 Having these gloomy prospects before their eyes, Knox and 1 MS.

It was contended by Morton, that one only way remained to extirpate the Romish faith, and replace rehgion upon a secure basis ; this was, to break off the parliament, by the murder of Riccio, to imprison the queen, entrust Darnley with the nominal sovereignty, and restore the Earl of Murray to be the head of the government. Desperate as were these designs, the Reformed party in Scotland did not hesitate to adopt them. Their horror of Idolatry, the name they bestowed on the Roman Catholic rehgion, misled their judg ment and hardened their feelings, and they re garded the plot as the act of men raised up by God for the destruction of an accursed supersti tion. The General Fast, which always secured the presence of a formidable and numerous band of partisans, was near approaching ; and as the murder had been fixed for the week in March, in which the parhament had been summoned, it was contrived that this religious solemnity should be held in the capital at the same time. This secured Morton and enabled him to work with greater boldness.2 Having so far organized the conspiracy, it re- 1 See the evidence on which this fact is now stated for the first time in Proofs and Ihustrations, No. I. 2 MS.

It was accordingly arranged by him, with Grange, Ochil tree, the father-in-law of Knox, and the other banished lords, that as soon as the day for the murder was fixed, they should be informed of it, and then order matters so that their return to Edinburgh should take place instantly after it was committed.2 But this was not all. According to a common but revolting practice of this age, which combined the utmost feudal ferocity with a singular love of legal formalities, it was resolved, that \" Co venants\" or contracts for the commission of the murder, and the benefits to be derived from it should be entered into, and signed by the young king himself and the rest of the conspirators.

Of these persons, some were in England, and could not personally assist in the assassin ation ; and to them, among others, Morton and Ruthven no doubt alluded, when they afterwards declared, that the most honest and the most wor thy, were easily induced to approve of the in tended murder, and to support their prince in its execution.2 The second \" Covenant\" has been also preserved.

It proves that Ehzabeth received the most precise intimation of the intended murder of Riccio, that she was made fully acquainted with the deter mination to secure the person of the Scottish queen, and create a revolution in the government. Mur ray's share in the conspiracy, and his consent to the assassination of the foreign secretary, are esta blished by the same letter beyond a doubt ; and we see the declared object of the plot was, to put an end to his banishment, to replace him in the power which he had lost, and by one decided and triumphant blow, to destroy the schemes which were in agita tion for the re-establishment of the Roman Catholic religion in Scotland. It is of great moment to attend to the conduct of Elizabeth at this crisis. She knew all that was about to occur : the hfe of Riccio, the hberty \u2014 perhaps, too, the hfe \u2014 of Mary was in her hands ; Murray was at her court ; the conspirators were at her devotion ; they had given the fullest information to Randolph, that he might consult the queen: she might have imprisoned Murray, discomfited the plans of the conspirators, saved the life of the miserable victim who was marked for slaughter, and preserved Mary, to whom she professed a warm attachment, from cap tivity. All this might have been done, perhaps it Bedford and Thomas Randolph, to Secretary Cecil, endorsed by Cecil's clerk, Earl of Bedford and Mr. Randolph to my Mr,"], [59, "1565. 33 MARY. is not too much to say, that even in these dark times it would have been done by a monarch acutely alive to the common feelings of humanity. But Elizabeth adopted a very different course : she not only allowed Murray to leave her realm, she dismissed him with marks of the highest confidence and distinction, and this baron, when ready to set out for Scotland, to take his part in those dark transactions which soon after followed, sent his secretary, Wood, to acquaint Cecil with the most secret intentions of the conspirators.1 Whilst these terrible designs were in preparation against her, some hints of approaching danger were conveyed to the Scottish queen ; but she impru dently disregarded them. Riccio too received a mysterious caution from Damiot, an astrologer, whom he used to consult, and who bad him beware of the bastard, evidently alluding to George Dou glas, the natural son of the Earl of Angus, and one of the chief conspirators ; but he imagined that he pointed at Murray, then in banishment, and derided his apprehensions.2 Meantime every thing was in readiness ; a large concourse of the friends of the Reformed Church assembled at Edinburgh, for the week of fasting and humiliation : directions for prayer and sermons, had been previously drawn up by Knox and the ministers, and the subjects 1 MS.

They were selected from the Old Testament alone, and included, amongst other examples, the slaying of Oreb and Zeb, the cutting off the Ben jamites, the fast of Esther, the hanging of Haman, inculcating the duty of inflicting swift and summary vengeance on all who persecuted the people of God.1 On the 3rd of March the fast commenced in the capital, and on the 4th, parliament assembled. It was opened by the queen in person, and the lords of the Articles having been chosen, the statute of treason and forfeiture against Murray and the banished lords was prepared. This was on a Thursday ; and on Tuesday, in the following week, the act was to be passed ; but it was fearfully arrested in its progress.2 On Saturday evening, about seven o'clock, when it was dark, the Earls of Morton and Lindsay, with a hundred and fifty men bearing torches and wea pons, occupied the court of the palace of Holyrood, seized the gates without, resistance and closed them against all but their own friends. At this moment Mary was at supper in a small closet or cabinet, which entered from her bed chamber.

A minute had scarcely passed when Ruthven, clad in complete armour, abruptly broke in. This man had just risen from a sick bed, his features were sunk and pale from disease, his voice hollow, and his whole appearance haggard and terrible.

Here Morton and his men rushed upon him, and buried their daggers in his body. So eager and reckless were they in their ferocity, that in the struggle to get at him, they wounded one another, nor did they think the work complete till the body was mangled by fifty-six wounds, and left in a pool of blood, with the king's dagger sticking in it, to show as was afterwards alleged, that he had sanc tioned the murder.1 Nothing can more strongly show the ferocious manners of the times than an incident which now occurred.

Here he threw himself upon a seat, called for a cup of wine, and being reproached for the cruelty of his conduct, not only vindicated himself and his associates, but plunged a new dagger into the heart of the unhappy queen, by declaring that her husband had advised the whole. She was then ignorant of the completion of the murder, but suddenly one of her ladies rushed into the room and cried out that their victim was slain. \" And is it so,\" said Mary, \" then farewell tears, we must now think of revenge.'\" Having finished the first act of this tragedy, the conspirators proceeded to follow out their precon certed measures. The queen was kept a prisoner in her apartment, and strictly guarded. The king assuming the sole power, addressed his royal letters, dissolving the parliament, and commanding the Es tates to leave the capital within three hours on pain of treason ; orders were despatched to the magistrates, enjoining them with their city force to keep a vigilant watch, and suffer none but Pro testants to leave their houses. And to Morton, the chancellor, with his armed retainers, was entrusted the guarding the gates of the palace, with strict injunction that none should escape from it.2 This, however, amid the tumult of a midnight murder, was not so easy a task. Huntley and Both well contrived to elude the guards. Sir James Bal four and James Melvil were equally fortunate ; and 1 Morton and Ruthven' s Narrative ut supra.

But Mary in vain implored to speak with them ; she was dragged back from the window by the ruffians, who threatened to cut her in pieces if she attempted to show herself; and in her stead the pusillanimous Darnley was thrust for ward. He addressed the citizens, assured them that both he and the queen were in safety, and, commanding them on their allegiance to go home, was instantly obeyed.1 Thus ended all hope of rescue ; but although baffled in this attempt, secluded even from her women, trembling and justly fearing for her life, the queen's courage and presence of mind did not forsake her. She remonstrated with her hus band ; she even condescended to reason with Ruth ven, who replied in rude and upbraiding terms, and at last exhausted with this effort, she would have sunk down had they not called for her ladies and left her to repose. Next morning all the horrors of her condition broke fully upon her ; she was a prisoner, in the hands of a band of assassins ; they 1 Mary to Archbishop Beaton, 2 April, 1565-6. Keith, 332.

These thoughts agitated her to excess, and threw her into a fever, in which she imagined the ferocious Ruthven was coming to murder her, and shrieking out that she was abandoned by all, she was threatened with miscarriage. The piteous sight revived Darnley's affection ; her gentlewomen were admitted, and the danger passed away, yet so strong was the suspicion with which she was guarded, that no lady was allowed to pass \" muffled \" from the queen's chamber.1 It was now Sunday night, the murder had been committed late on Saturday evening ; and according to their previous concert, Murray, Rothes and Ochil tree, with others of the banished lords, arrived in the capital and instantly rode to the palace. They were welcomed by Darnley ; and so little did Mary sus pect Murray's foreknowledge of the murder, that she instantly sent for him, and throwing herself into his arms in an agony of tears, exclaimed, \" if my brother had been here he never would have suffered me to have been thus cruelly handled.\" The sight overcame him, and he is reported to have wept ; but, if sincere, his compunction was momentary, for, from the queen he repaired to Morton, and in a 1 Morton and Ruthven's Narrative.

She perceived that her influence over her husband was not at an end, and exerting those powers of fasci- nation and persuasive language which she possessed in so high a degree, she succeeded in alarming his fears, and awakening his love. She represented to him, that he was surrendering himself a tool into the hands of her enemies and his own : if they had belied her honour, if they had periled her life, and that of his unborn infant, could he beheve, that when he alone stood between them and their ambi- tion, they would hesitate to destroy him. Already he might see they took the power into their own hands, and when he sent his servants to her, refused to admit them, and then the flagrant falsehood of accusing him as a party to so base a murder, a deed which had he really contemplated, (but this she was assured he never had) must cover him with infamy in the eyes of the country, and of the world. Their only safety lay in escaping together.

Darnley was won by her arguments, and becoming terrified for the consequences of the murder, took refuge in falsehood, denied all con- nection with the conspiracy, and placed himself in the hands of Mary, with the same facihty which had lately made him the slave of the conspirators. Ruthven and Morton, however, were not so easily deceived, and insisted that the queen meant only to betray them. The king replied, she was a true princess, that he would stake his life for her faith and honour,1 and led the conspirators to her pre- sence, where she heard their defence, assured them of her readiness to pardon, and sent them away to draw up a writing for their security. They did so, delivered the paper to Darnley, left the palace, removed the guards, and permitted the servants of the household to resume their charge.

The news of her escape 1 This assertion of Darnley, which gives a direct contradiction to the story of Mary's alleged passion for Riccio, rests on the evidence of Lord Ruthven, who was present. \u2014 See his narrative of the murder in Keith, Appendix, p. 128."], [68, "1565. 42 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. flew through the land, her nobles, Huntly, Athol, Bothwell, and multitudes of barons and gentlemen, crowded round her, and in the morning Morton, Ruthven, and the rest of the conspirators, awoke only to hear that their victim had eluded their grasp, that an army of her subjects had already assembled at Dunbar, and that the penalties of treason were suspended over their heads. Mary thus escaped, and it is impossible to with hold our admiration of the coolness, judgment, and courage exhibited by a woman under the dread ful circumstances in which she was called upon to exert these qualities. If we blame her dupli city,- let it be remembered, that her own life, and that of her infant, were in jeopardy, that there was nothing unreasonable in the idea that the ruffians who had torn her secretary from her knees, and murdered him in her chamber, might before many hours were over, be induced to repeat the deed upon herself. We may gather, indeed, from the dark and indefinite expressions of Randolph in describing the approaching assassination, that their intentions, if she resisted their wishes, vacillated between murder and perpetual captivity. Once more free, the queen acted with her usual spirit and decision. Having regained her ascen dancy over the king, she obtained from this weak prince a disclosure of the chief persons engaged in the conspiracy. It would appear, however, that Darnley concealed Murray's guilt, and only de nounced Morton, Ruthven, and other associates."], [69, "1565 43 MARY Against them the queen took instant steps. She summoned her people to attend her in arms, di rected a writ of treason to be issued against the Chancellor, Lethington, and their accomplices, and advanced at the head of a force of eight thousand men to the capital.1 Aware of this, the conspi rators fled with the utmost precipitation. Morton, Ruthven, Brunston, and Andrew Car, took instant refuge in England, others, scattered hither and thither, concealed themselves in their own country. Knox in great agony of spirit, and groaning over the Church and his flock, buried himself in the friendly recesses of Kyle, and Lethington hastened to gain the mountain fastnesses of Athol. It was remarkable that Craig, the colleague of Knox, did not leave the city.2 To the English queen, and her brother, the Earl of Murray, Mary had a more difficult part to act, whilst she felt equal embarrassment as to the degree of confidence to be given to the king. We have seen incontrovertible proof that Murray was a party to the murder, though not a perpetrator of it, that Elizabeth was accessory to the conspi racy, and that Darnley and his father Lennox were the original contrivers of the whole : but of all this 1 Knox, p. 344, Hist. 2 MS.

Elizabeth on being informed of the outrage, expressed the deepest sympathy and indignation; Murray affected an equal abhorrence of every thing that had occurred. Darnley not only denounced his former friends, but busied himself in bringing them to justice. The queen, therefore, without renouncing her resolu tion to punish the murder with the utmost rigour, deemed it prudent in the first instance to secure the active assistance of Ehzabeth, to strengthen her ties with France, and to promote a reconci liation amongst her nobility, many of whom were at feud with each other : Bothwell, who during the late disturbances had vigorously exerted him self for his sovereign, was the enemy of Murray and Lethington \u2014 Athol, with whom Lethington had taken refuge, was at variance with Argile, and the differences amongst the leading barons as usual extended their ramifications though all their retainers and dependants. It says much for the judgment of the queen that her efforts to compose these fatal differences were successful. Murray and Bothwell were reconciled, Argile and Athol agreed to suspend their contests, and Mary seemed even disposed to pardon Morton, Lethington, and the principal conspirators, if the extension of mercy could have brought back peace and security to her kingdom.

Her weak and treacherous husband became alarmed, and more loudly denounced his late friends, who had mur dered Riccio. This conduct enraged them to the utmost, and they retaliated by again accusing him in more distinct and positive terms than before of being the sole instigator and contriver of the mur der. To prove this, they laid the \" bands,\" or covenants before the queen, and the dreadful truth broke upon her in all its sickening and heart rending force.1 She now understood for the first time that the king was the principal conspirator against her, the defamer of her honour, the plotter against her liberty and her crown, the almost mur derer of herself and her unborn child ; he was con victed as a traitor and a liar, false to his own honour, false to her, false to his associates in crime. At this moment Mary must have felt, that to have leant upon a husband whom she could trust, might, amid the terrible plots with which she was surround ed, have been the means of saving herself and her crown ; but on Darnley she could never lean again. Can we wonder that her heart was almost broken by the discovery \u2014 that, to use the words of Melvil, she should have loudly lamented the king's folly and unthankfulness, that she was compelled to withdraw from him all confidence, and in solitary bitterness to act entirely for herself.1 But if such were the queen's feelings towards the 1 MS.

Even in those flagitious days, there were sanctions, the disregard of which covered a man with infamy and contempt, and amongst these, one of the most sacred was fidelity to the written \" bands \" by which the feudal barons were bound to each other. To one of these Darnley, as we have seen, had become a principal \u2014 his fellow- conspirators had performed their promise : he had not only broken his and denied all accession to the plot, but had betrayed the principal actors, and meanly pur chased his own safety by their destruction. The consequence was the utmost indignation, and a thirst for revenge upon the part of Morton, Murray, Lethington, and their associates, which there is reason to believe increased in intensity till it was assuaged only in his death. These feelings of indignation were not confined to the fugititive lords. Mary avoided his company, and forbad her friends to give him any countenance. She pro moted Joseph Riccio, David's brother, who had arrived in the suite of Mauvissiere, the French ambassador, to the dangerous vacancy caused by the murder j1 and at last became so impatient and passed between the king and the lords.

The Enghsh queen received the intelligence with her usual duplicity. From Cecil, who saw her before Melvil was admitted, and whispered the unwelcome news in her ear as she was dancing at Greenwich, after sup per, she could not conceal her feehngs.

She promised also, in reply to his urgent request, that there should be a speedy set tlement of the question of the succession.2 Meanwhile Mary recovered, and assured of the continuance of amicable relations with England, apphed herself with her usual energy to heal the dissensions amongst her nobles, to conduct internal tranquillity and to re-estabhsh a firm government.

Amongst her nobi lity there was no want of talents or energy ; the difficulty was, to attach them to the Crown, to heal their feuds amongst themselves, to prevent their intrigues with England. So long as Lethington was in disgrace, and the murderers of Riccio were banished, these ends could not be gained. The queen, therefore, listened to the intercession of Murray, whom she now treated with great confi dence. Lethington was reconciled to Bothwell, and pardoned ; the lairds of Brunston, Ormiston, Hatton, and Calder, the leaders of the Church party, were received into favour, but Knox still continued in his retreat, and there appears to have been some special rigour manifested against him on the part of the queen.1 Morton, the arch con spirator, with his assistants, Lindsay and Ruthven, were still proscribed, but Murray, Bothwell, Argile, Athol, and Lethington, who now acted together, exerted themselves unremittingly to procure their restoration, and the queen, it was evident, began to think of permitting their return. 2 This intended mercy enraged the young king, and appears to have driven him upon foolish and dangerous courses: as his opponents were mostly Protestants, he began to intrigue with the Roman ists, and went so far as to write secretly to the i M'Crie's Life of Knox p. 254. 2 MS.

The interview and remonstrances to which this led, are of much importance, in estimating the dark charges afterwards brought against Mary, and we fortunately know the whole particulars from the Lords of the Council before whom it took place, and also from the French am bassador, de Croc, who was present.

He persisted in his project of leaving the kingdom, de nounced Lethington, the Justice Clerk, Bellenden, and Makgill the clerk register, as principal conspi rators against Riccio, insisted that they should be deprived of their offices, and became an object of dislike and suspicion not only to Mary, but to all that powerful, and now united, party, by whom she was surrounded.1 Its leaders Murray, Lething ton, Argile, and Bothwell, saw in him the bitter opponent of Morton's pardon. The faction of the church hated him for his intrigues with Rome,2 Cecil and the party of Ehzabeth suspected him of practices with the English Roman Catholics,3 the Hamiltons had always looked on him with dislike, as an obstacle between them and their hopes of succession, and the queen bitterly repented that she was tied to a wayward and intemperate person, who had already endangered her hfe and her crown, and was constantly thwarting every mea sure which promised the restoration of tranquillity and good government.

So far as this task went, Both- well was well fitted for it. He was of high rank, possessed a daring and martial spirit, and his un- shaken attachment to her interests, at a time when the queen had suffered from the desertion of almost every other servant, made him a favourite with a princess who esteemed bravery and fidelity above all other virtues. But unfortunately for Mary, he possessed other and more dangerous qualities.2 His ambition and audacity were unbounded. He was a man of notorious gallantry, and had spent a loose life on the Continent, from which it was said, he had imported some of its worst vices.

There seems to have been little craft or hypocrisy about him, and he made no attempt to conceal his infirmities or vices under the cloak of religion. It is not unlikely, that for this reason, Mary, who had experienced his fidelity to the crown, was more disposed to trust him in any diffi culty, than those stern and fanatical leaders, who, with religion on their lips, were often equally indif ferent as to the means which they employed. It is certain, that from this time she began to treat him with great favour, and to be guided by a prefer ence so predominant, that it was not unlikely to be mistaken for a more tender feeling. This par tiality of the queen for Bothwell, was early de tected by Murray, Lethington, and their associ ates : they observed that his vanity was flattered by the favour shown him by his sovereign, they artfully fanned the flame, and encouraged an am bition already daring enough, to aspire to a height which he had never dreamt of, and it is the opinion of Sir James Melvil, who spoke from per sonal observation, that Bothwell's plot for the mur der of his sovereign, and the possession of the queen's person, had its origin about this time, when she despatched him to suppress the disturb ances in Liddesdale.1 1 Melvil's Memoirs, pp. 170, 173.

At this moment, these districts were in a state of great disorder, a feud raged between the Armstrongs and the Johnstons, two of the fiercest and most numerous septs in that part of the country.1 The arrival of Bothwell, the queen's lieutenant, with a commission to reduce them to obedience, rather increased the disturbances, and in an attempt to apprehend Elliot of Park, a noto rious marauder, the earl was grievously wounded, and left for dead on the field. An account of the sanguinary skirmish in which this happened, was im mediately sent by Lord Scrope to Secretary Cecil. \" I have,\" said he, \" presently gotten intelligence out of Scotland, that the Earl of Bothwell, being in Liddesdale for the apprehension of certain dis ordered persons there, had apprehended the lairds of Mangerton and Whitehaugh, with sundry other Armstrongs of their surname and kindred whom he had put within the Harmitage.2 And yesterday, going about to take such like persons of the Elliotts, in pursuit of them his lordship being fore most, and far before his company, encountered one John Elliott of the Park, hand to hand, and shot i MS.

This accident happened on the 7th of October, and on the next day the 8th, the queen arrived at Jedburgh, and opened her court.3 The proceed ings against the various delinquents who were brought before it, occupied her uninterruptedly until the 15th, on which day she rode to the Harmitage, and visited the Earl of Bothwell, who lay there confined by his wounds. The ob ject of the visit appears to have been to hold a conference with the earl on the state of that dis turbed district of which he was the governor. Mary was accompanied by Murray and others of her officers, in whose presence she communi cated with Bothwell : afterwards on the same day, she returned to Jedburgh ;* and Lord Scrope, who immediately informed Cecil of the visit, added the precise information, that she had remained two 1 A pistol. 2 MS.

Immediately after her return, Mary was seized with a dangerous fever, which ran its course with an alarming rapidity, and for ten days caused the physicians to despair of her life. Its origin was traced by some, to the fatigue of her long ride to the Harmitage, but her secretary Lethington, with greater probability, in a letter written to Beaton, the Scottish ambassador in France, ascribed her illness to distress of mind, occasioned by the cruel and ungrateful conduct of the king.2 \" The occa sion of the queen's sickness,\" said he, \" so far as I \" Sa majeste fut requise et conseihe d'aller visiter en une maison appelle Hermitage pour entendre de luy l'estat des affaires de pays de quel le dit Sieur (Bothwell) estait gouverneur heredit airement.

But if there was a recovery of bodily health, there was no return to peace of mind. During the height of her illness, the king had never come to see her, and a visit which he made when the dan ger was past, produced no effect in removing their unhappy estrangement.1 At this moment her con dition, as described by an eye-witness, Monsieur de Croc, was pitiable and affecting. She seemed to have fallen into a profound melancholy. \" The queen,\" said this ambassador, writing to the Arch bishop of Glasgow, on the 2nd December, \" is for the present at Craigmillar, about a league distant from this city.

This was, to unite their efforts to procure a divorce between her and her husband, stipulating as a preliminary that she should pardon the Earl of Morton and his accomphces in the murder of Riccio. When their design was first intimated by i Translation by Keith, from part of an original letter of Mon sieur de Croc, dated 2 December, 1566, preserved at that time amongst the MSS. of the Scots Cohege at Paris.

It was remarked that after the divorce Darnley had better live in a remote part of the country, at a distance from the queen, or retire to France. Upon which Mary relenting, drew back from the proposal, expressed a hope that he might return to a better mind, and professed her own willingness to pass into France and remain there till he ac knowledged his faults. To this Maitland, the secre tary, made this remarkable reply, hinting darkly, that rather than subject their queen to such an in dignity as retiring from her kingdom, it would be better to substitute murder for divorce, \" Madam,\" said he, \" soucy J ye not we are here of the princi pal of your grace's nobility and council, that shall not find the mean1 well to make your majesty quit of him, without prejudice of your son ; and albeit, that my lord of Murray here present, be little less scrupulous for a Protestant nor [than] your grace is for a Papist, I am assured he will look through his fingers thereto, and will behold our doings, and say nothing thereto.\"2 This speech alarmed the queen, who instantly replied, that it was her pleasure no thing should be done by which any spot might be laid upon her honour ; \" better,\" said she, \" per mit the matter remain in the state it is, abiding 1 In orig. the moyen. 2 Anderson's Collections, vol. iv. p. 192 ; and contemporary copy, St. P.

It appears to me that the first part alluded solely to the divorce, and that the second proposition hinted at the murder, though darkly, yet in terms which could scarcely have been misunderstood by any who were present.2 It is certain that the queen commanded Murray, Bothwell, and their associates to abandon all thoughts of any such design ; but it had been glanced at, she was put upon her guard, and difficult or impossible as it might have been, at once to dismiss these leading nobles from her councils, precautions might have been taken to de feat their abominable purpose. It is possible, how ever, that Mary considered her express command sufficient. Tins, however, was but a feeble barrier in these cruel times.

This contract was, he adds, devised by Sir James Balfour, and subscribed by them ah a quarter of a year before the deed was done. Ormiston in another part of his confession, observes, that Bothweh broke to him the purpose for the murder on the Friday before ; and when he expressed re luctance to have any concern in it, he said, \" Tush, Ormiston, ye need not take fear of this, for the whole lords have concluded the same lang syne, in Craigmillar, ah that was there with the queen.\" The same Bond is minutely alluded to in a contempo rary life of Mary, written in French, apparently by one of her domestics, who, although biassed, seems to have had good op portunities of observation.

The causes of this strange conduct were no doubt to be found in his sullen and jealous temper ; the cold ness between him and the queen, and the ill-dis guised hostility with which he was regarded by Both well, Murray, and the ruling party at court, who were now busy labouring for the recal of Morton, so recently Darnley's associate in the murder of Riccio, but now his most bitter enemy.

And I caused tell him likewise, that as it would not be very proper for him to come to my lodgings, because there was such a crowd of company there, so he might know that there were two passages to it ; and if he should enter by the one, I should be constrained to go out by the other.

Soon after this he was seized with a disease which threw out pustules over his body ; and a report arose that he had been poisoned. The rumour cannot excite wonder when we recollect the bond for the murder of the unhappy prince, which had been entered into at Craigmillar, and which its authors, who occupied the chief places about the queen, only awaited a safe opportunity to execute. But in the present case rumour spoke false, for the disease proved to be the small pox, and the queen immediately despatched her own physician to at- tend him.2 It was impossible, however, that he should receive much sympathy, either from Mary or her ministers.

On interrogating Lutyni, Drury found him in the greatest alarm, affirming, that if he were sent back to Scotland, it would be to \" a prepared death.\"1 Upon this he consulted Cecil, and received orders not to deliver him up, but to detain him at Berwick. The whole circumstances are exceedingly obscure, but it appears to me certain from Riccio's letter, that Lutyni had become ac- quainted through him with some secret, the betrayal of which was a matter of life or death\u2014 that Mary suspected that he had stolen or read some of her pri- vate papers, that she had determined to examine him herself upon this point, and that every thing depended on his deceiving the queen on his return, by adher- ing to the tale which had been already told her.

This, however, is only presumption, and the letter might relate to some other state secret. But we shall again meet with Lutyni and Riccio \u2014 and meanwhile I proceed to those dreadful scenes, which so soon followed the baptism of the prince and the pardon of the Earl of Morton.

On his road to Edinburgh, Morton took up his residence at Whittingham, the seat of Archibald Douglas, his near relative, and soon after was joined there by the Earl of Both well and secretary Lethington.1 The object of this visit was immediately explained by Bothwell, who in presence of Archibald Douglas, acquainted him with their determination to murder the king, and added as an inducement for him to join the plot, that the queen had consented to his death. The atrocious proposal was dechned by Morton, not influenced by any feehngs of horror, which from his character, he was not hkely to give way to, but on other grounds. He was unwilling, he said, to meddle with new troubles, when he had scarcely got rid of an old offence.2 Archibald Douglas then earnestly exhorted him to join the plot, and Bothwell, in a second interview, to which Lethington was admitted, reiterated his arguments, and insisted that all was done at the queen's desire. Bring me then, said Morton, the queen's hand writ for a warrant, and you shall have my answer. Upon this, Douglas accompanied Lethington and Bothwell to Edinburgh, and soon after he received 1 Morton to Cecil from Berwick. MS. Letter. St. P. Off. 10 Jan. 1566-7. MS. Letter B.C.

These secret interviews and conversations, took place at Whittingham and Edinburgh in the latter part of the month of January, and on the 22nd of the same month, Mary set out on a visit to the king at Glasgow. Darnley was now partially recovered from his late sickness, but he had received some private intelligence of the plots against him. He was aware of the return of Morton, who regarded him as the cause of all his late sufferings, he knew that amongst his mortal enemies who had never forgiven him his desertion of them in the conspiracy against Riccio, were some of the highest nobihty who now enjoyed the confidence of the queen. He had re cently heard from one of his servants, that Mary had spoken of him with much severity,2 and her visit, therefore, took him by surprise. Under this 1 Morton's confession before his death.

To this Mary briefly replied, that there was no medicine against fear ; and passing forward to Glasgow, came into Darnley's bedchamber, when after greeting, and some indifferent talk, the subjects which had es tranged them from each other were introduced. Darnley professed a deep repentance for his errors, pleaded his youth, and the few friends he now had, and declared to her his unalterable affection. Mary reminded him of his complaints and suspicions, spoke against his foolish plan of leaving the king dom, and recalled to his mind the \" purpose of Hie gate,\" a name given to a plot which Darnley affirmed he had discovered, and of which he was himself to be the victim. The queen demanded who was his informer. He replied the Laird of Minto, who had told him that a letter was presented to her in Craigmillar, made by her own device, and sub scribed by certain others who desired her to sign it, which she refused.2 Darnley then added, that he would never think that she, who was his own proper flesh, would do him any hurt, and if any others should do it, they should buy it dear, unless i Anderson, vol. iv., pp. 168, 169, and MS.

He observed, however, that he suspected none, and only entreated her to bear him company, and not as she was wont, to with draw herself from him. Mary then told him, that as he was still httle able to travel, she had brought a litter with her to carry him to Craigmillar, and he declared his readiness to accompany her, if she would consent that they should again live together at bed and board. She promised it should be as he had spoken, and gave him her hand, but added, that before this, he must be thoroughly cleansed of his sickness, which she trusted he shortly would be, as she intended to give him the bath at Craigmillar. The queen also requested him to conceal the pro mises which had now passed between them, as the suddenness of their agreement might give umbrage to some of the lords ; to which he rephed, that he could see no reason why they should mishke it. When Mary left him, Darnley called Craw ford to him, and informing him fully of all that had passed at the interview, bade him communi cate it to his father, the Earl of Lennox. He then asked him what he thought of the queen's taking him to Craigmillar ? She treats your ma jesty, said Crawford, too hke a prisoner. Why should you not be taken to one of your own houses in Edinburgh? It struck me much the same way, answered Darnley, and I have fears enough, but may God judge between us, I have her promise only to trust to ; but I have put myself in her hands, and I shall go with her, though she"], [105, "1567 MARY 79 should murder me.1 It is from Crawford's evi dence, taken on oath, which was afterwards pro duced, and still exists, endorsed by Cecil, that we learn these minute particulars, nor have I been able to discover any sufficient ground to doubt its truth.2 Soon after this interview, the queen carried her husband by slow journies, from Glasgow to Edinburgh, where she arrived on the last day of January.3 It had been at first intended as we have seen, that Darnley should have taken up his resi dence at CraigmiUar, but this purpose was changed, and as the palace of Holyrood was judged from its low situation to be unhealthy, and little fitted for an invalid, the king was brought to a suburb called the Kirk of Field, a more remote and airy site, occu pied by the town residence of the Duke of Chastel herault, and other buildings, and gardens. On their arrival here, the royal attendants were about to proceed to the duke's lodging as it was called, but on alighting, Mary informed them, that the 1 MS. St. P. Off.

This earl, whose influence was now nearly supreme at court, had recently returned from Liddesdale, and when he understood that Mary and the king were on their road from Glas gow, he met them with his attendants, a short way from the capital, and accompanied the party to the Kirk of Field.3 At this moment the reconciliation between the queen and her husband seemed to be complete. She assiduously superintended every little detail which could add to his comfort. She treated him not only with attention but tenderness, passed much of the day in his society, and had a cham ber prepared for herself immediately below his, where she slept.4 The king was partially re- 1 Evidence of Thomas Nelson.

He knew that plots had been entertained against his life, and, as we have seen, suspected many of the nobles to be his enemies. Yet he trusted to the promises of the queen, and, no doubt, believed that if she remained beside him, they would find it impossible to accom plish their cruel purpose. But when he indulged these hopes, the miserable prince was on the very brink of destruction. Since their recent meeting at Whittingham, Bothwell, Morton, Lethington, and Sir James Bal four, had fully determined on the murder. The Earls of Huntly, Argile, and Caithness, Archibald Douglas, with the Archbishop of St. Andrew's, and many others of the leading lords and legal officers in the country had joined the conspiracy, and some who did not choose directly to share in the plot, deemed it dangerous or impolitic to reveal it. Of this neutral sort, the greatest was Murray, whom from the evi dence that yet remains, it is impossible to believe ignorant of the resolutions of his friends, but whose superior sagacity enabled him to avoid any direct connection with the atrocious design which they now hurried on to its accomplishment. On Sunday the 9th of February, Bastian, a fo reigner belonging to the household of the queen, was to be married at Holyrood. The bride, was one of her favourite women, and Mary, to honour their union,- had promised them a masque. The greatest part of that day, she passed with the king. They appeared to be on the most affectionate terms, VOL- VI. . G"], [108, "82 1567. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. and she declared her intention of remaining all night at the Kirk of Field. It was at this moment, when Darnley and the queen were engaged in conversa tion, that Hay of Tallo, Hepburn of Bolton, and other ruffians whom Bothwell had hired for the purpose, secretly entered the chamber which was under the king's, and deposited on the floor a large quantity of gunpowder in bags. They then laid a train, which was connected with a \" lunt,\" or slow match, and placed every thing in readiness for its being lighted. Some of them now hurried away, but two of the conspirators remained on the watch, and in the meantime Mary, who still sat with her husband in the upper-chamber, recollected her pro mise of giving the masque at Bastian's wedding, and taking farewell of Darnley, embraced him and left the house with her suite.1 Soon aster, the king retired to his bed-cham ber. Since his illness there appeared to have been a great change in him. He had become more thoughtful, and thought had brought with it repent ance of his former courses. He lamented there were few near him whom he could trust, and at times he would say, that he knew he should be slain, complaining that he was hardly dealt with, but from these sorrows he had sought refuge in reli gion, and it was remarked that on this night, his last in this w^orld, he had repeated the 55th Psalm, which he would often read and sing.2 After his 1 Nelson's Evidence, Anderson, vol. iv., p. 167. 2 MS.

This was the moment seized by the murderers, who still lurked in the lower room, to complete their dreadful purpose, but their miserable victim was awakened by the noise of their false keys in the lock of his apartment, and rushing down in his shirt and pelisse, endeavoured to make his escape, but he was intercepted and strangled after a desperate resist ance, Ms cries for mercy being heard by some wo men in the nearest house ; the page was also stran gled, and their bodies carried into a small orchard, without the garden wall, where they were found, the king in his shirt only, and the pelisse by his side.1 Amid the conflicting stories of the ruffians who were executed, it is difficult to arrive at the whole truth ? But no doubt rests on the part acted by Both well, the arch-conspirator. He had quitted the king's apartments with the queen, and joined the festivities in the palace, from which about mid night he stole away, changed his rich dress, and rejoined the murderers who waited for him at the Kirk of Field. His arrival was the signal to com plete their purpose; the match was lighted, but burnt too slow for their breathless impatience, and they were stealing forward to examine it, when it took effect.

Here Both well had scarcely undressed and gone to bed, when the cry arose in the city, that the Kirk of Field had been blown up, and the king murdered. The news flew quickly to Holyrood, and a servant xushing into his chamber imparted the dreadful tidings. He started up in ' well-feigned astonish ment, and shouted \" Treason !\" He was joined next moment by Huntly, a brother conspira tor, and immediately these two noblemen, with others belonging to the court, entered the queen's apartments, when Mary was made acquainted with the dreadful fate of her husband.1 She was horror struck, shut herself up in her bed-chamber, and seemed overwhelmed with sorrow.2 The murder had been committed on Monday, about two in the morning, and when day broke, multitudes crowded to examine the Kirk of Field. Any lengthened scrutiny, however, was not per mitted, for Bothwell soon repaired to the spot with a guard, and the king's body was carried to a neighbouring house, where it lay till it was pro duced before the privy council. In the brief in terval, however, it had been noted that the bodies 1 Declaration of William Pourie.

Two days, how ever, elapsed before any step was taken,2 but on the Wednesday after the murder, a proclamation offered two thousand pounds reward, to any who would come forward with information ; and scarce was this made public, when a paper was fixed during the night, on the door of the Tolbooth, or common prison. It denounced the Earl of Both well, Mr. James Balfour, and David Chambers, as guilty of the king's slaughter. Voices, too, were heard in the streets at dead of night, arraigning the same persons ; and as the fate of the king had excited the deepest indignation in the people, Mary's friends looked with the utmost anxiety to the conduct she should pursue. To their mortifi cation, it was anything but satisfactory.

None of the nobility attended the ceremony, and it was remarked, that, of the officers of state, the Justice Clerk Bellenden was alone present.2 Meantime, whilst the queen was at Seton, pla cards accusing Bothwell, were openly exposed in the capital. The first of these appeared on the 17th, another repeated the denunciation on the 19th, and on the succeeding day, the Earl of Len nox, father to the murdered king, commenced a correspondence with the queen, in which he im plored her to apprehend the suspected persons, and to lose no time in investigating the circumstances of his son's slaughter.3 She replied that the placards contradicted each other, and that she was at a loss on which to proceed.

But he besought her in vain.1 At the moment he was writing, Bothwell continued in high favour, and enjoyed the most familiar intercourse with Mary. Although the reports of his guilt as the principal assassin became daily stronger ; nay, as if to convince Lennox, that all remonstrances would be inefficacious, Sir James Balfour, the very man who was named as his fellow-murderer, was suffered to be at large. It was at this time, that Lutyni the Italian, Joseph Riccio's companion, was sent back by Drury to the Queen of Scots. Riccio himself, as we have just seen, had been accused as one of the murderers of the king; but that Lutyni's secret, of which Riccio so much dreaded the discovery, related to the plot, can only be conjectured. On his arrival, the queen did not see him(it was scarce a week after Darnley 's death), but directed that he should be exa mined by Bothwell. This baron was apparently sa tisfied with the reasons which he gave for his flight, and after a courteous interview, permitted him to re turn to Berwick. The queen, at the same time, sent him a present of thirty crowns, and he soon after 1 Anderson, vol. i., pp. 40, 44, 47, 48. Also Enclosure in MS. Letter. B.C. St. P. Off.

If she was afraid to seize the higher delin quents, it was at least no difficult matter to have apprehended and examined the persons who had provided the lodging in which the king was slain. The owner of the house Robert Balfour, was well known, her own servants who had been entrusted with the keys, and the king's domestics who had absented themselves before the explosion, or were preserved from its effects, were still on the spot, and might have been arrested and brought before the privy council.2 But nothing of this kind took place, and in this interval of delay and apparent indecision, many persons from whom information might have been elicited, and some who were actu ally accused, took the opportunity of leaving the country.

The Earls of Murray and Morton, who were absent from the capital at the time of the murder, showed no dispo sition to return, and Lennox, when requested by Mary to repair to court, dismissed her messenger without an answer.2 Meanwhile rumour was busy, and some particu lars were talked of amongst the people, which, if any real solicitude on the subject had existed, might have still given a clue to trace the assassins.

Mary and Bothwell would shoot at the butts against Huntly and Seton, and on one occasion after winning the match, they forced these lords to pay the forfeit in the shape of a dinner at Tranent.2 On the evening of the day in which the earl had exhibited so much fury in the streets of the capital, two more placards were hung up.

To this, indeed, she had been urged in the most solemn and earnest terms by Bishop Beaton, her ambassador at Paris. The day after Darn ley's death, she had written to this prelate, giving a brief description of the late dreadful events, and lamenting that his affectionate warning to beware of some sudden danger had arrived too late. In his answer he had implored her to lose no time in prosecuting its authors and vindi cating herself in the eyes of the world.

It was brought by Sir Henry Kyllygrew, who, on his arrival, after dining with Bothwell, Morton, Le thington, and Argile (all of them, as was after wards proved, participant in this cruel deed), was admitted to the queen. To see her face was impossible, for the chamber was dark, but, by her voice and manner, she seemed in profound grief; and not only assured the envoy of her desire to satisfy the Queen of England's wishes regarding 1 Keith, Preface, p. 9.

The Earl of Mar was induced to give up the Castle of Edinburgh, and it was given to Bothwell. Morton, after a secret and midnight interview with his royal mistress, received the Castle of Tantallon and other lands which he had forfeited by his rebellion, and it was remarked, that in return for this, his whole power and interest were assured to Bothwell. The Castle of Blackness, the Inch, and the Superiority of Leith, were conferred on the same favourite, and so completely did he rule every thing at court, that Murray, although he judged it prudent to keep on friendly terms, became dis- \u00bb MS.

Nor were these feelings likely to be soothed by the letters which she now received from France, in which the queen mother, and the cardi nal, her uncle, addressed her with bitter reproaches, and declared, that if she failed to avenge the death of the king, their cousin, and to clear herself from the imputations brought against her, they would not only consider her as utterly disgraced, but become her enemies.2 Urged by these repeated appeals, she at last resolved that Bothwell should be brought to a public trial, but the circumstances which attended this tardy exhibition of justice were little calculated to justify her in the opinion of her people.

His trial accordingly was little else than a mock ceremonial, directed by himself, and completely overruled by his crea tures. The Earl of Lennox, who at an earlier period had in vain implored the queen to investi gate the murder, and to collect, whilst it was attain able, such evidence as might bring the guilt home to its authors, now as earnestly and justly pleaded the necessity of delay. He had been summoned to ap pear and make good his accusation against Bothwell, but he declared that it was in vain to expect him to come singly, opposed to a powerful adversary, who enjoyed the royal favour, and commanded the town and the castle. He conjured the queen to grant him some time, that he might assemble his friends ; he observed, that when the suspected persons were still at liberty, powerful at court, and about her majesty's person, no fair trial could take place, and when all was in vain, he applied to Elizabeth, who wrote to Mary in the strongest terms, and besought her, as she hoped to save herself from the worst suspicions, to listen to so just a request. It was forcibly urged by the English queen, that Lennox was well assured of a combination to acquit Bothwell, and to accomplish by force, what could never be at tained by law; and she advised her, in the ma nagement of a cause which touched her so nearly, to use that sincerity and prudence which might convince the whole world, that she was guiltless.1 1 MS.

The state in which he found the city, soon convinced him that his message would be fruitless. When he entered the palace, the friends of the Earl of Bothwell were assembled. They and their followers mustered four thousand men, besides a guard of two hun dred hackbutters. This formidable force kept pos session of the streets, and filled the outer court of the palace, and as the castle was at his devotion, it was evident that Bothwell completely commanded the town. It was scarcely to be expected that a messenger whose errand was suspected to be a request for delay should be welcome, and although he announced him self to be bearer of a letter from Elizabeth, he was rudely treated, reproached as an English villain, who had come to stay the \" assize,\"1 and assured that the queen was too busy with the matters of the day, to attend to other business.

Lethington then assured him that his royal mistress was asleep, and could not receive the letter ; but the excuse was hardly uttered, before it was proved to be false, for at this moment, a servant of de Croc, the French ambassador, who stood beside the English envoy, looking up, saw, and pointed out the queen and Mary Fleming, wife of the secre tary, standing at a window of the palace ; nor did it escape their notice, that as Bothwell rode past, Mary gave him a friendly greeting for a farewell. The cavalcade then left the court, and proceeded to the Tolbooth, where the trial was to take place, Bothwell's hackbutters surrounding the door, and permitting none to enter who were suspected of being unfavourable to the accused.1 From the previous preparations, the result of such a trial might have been anticipated with cer tainty. The whole proceedings had already been arranged in a council, held some little time before, in which Bothwell had taken his seat, and given directions regarding his own arraignment.2 The jury consisted principally, if not wholly, of the favourers of the earl ; the law* officers of the crown were 1 MS.

When summoned to make good his accu sation, a gentleman named Cunningham appeared, and stated, that he had been sent by the earl his mas ter to reiterate the charge of murder, but to request delay, as his friends who had intended to have accom panied him both for his honour and security had changed their resolution.2 On this being refused to Lennox's envoy, he publicly protested against the va lidity of any sentence of acquittal, and withdrew. The jury were then chosen, the earl pleaded not guilty, and in the absence of all evidence, a unanimous ver dict of acquittal was pronounced. Bothwell then by a public cartel challenged any gentleman who should still brand him with the murder.

It has been argued by Mary's advocates, that she was a passive instrument in the hands of this faction, and could not, even if willing, have insisted on a fair trial. But, however anxious to lean to every pre sumption in favour of innocence, I have discovered no proofs of this servitude, and such imbecility appears to me inconsistent with the vigour, decision, and courage which were striking features in her character. The acquittal, although countenanced by the nobles, was loudly reprobated by the common people, and as rumours began to rise of a di vorce between Bothwell and his countess, a sister of Huntly, their indignation and disgust were strongly expressed. Even in the public streets, and in the queen's presence, these feelings betrayed themselves, and the market women, as Mary pass ed, would* cry out, \" God preserve your grace, if you are sackless2 of the king's death.\" It was i MS.

Yet, instead of opening her eyes to the perils of her situation, she seems to have resigned herself to the influence of one strong and engrossing passion, and her history at this moment hurried forward with something so like an irresistible fatality, as to make it cur rently reported amongst the people that Bothwell was dealing in love philtres, and had employed the sorceries of his old paramour, the lady Buccleugh. Immediately after the trial Parliament assembled, and the queen, irritated, perhaps, at the open cen sures of the city, declined the ancient custom of being guarded by the magistrates and trained bands, preferring a company of hackbutters. The ac quittal of Bothwell was then confirmed by the three estates, the conduct of the jury was approved of, the estates of Huntly and his friends restored, a rigid inquiry instituted against the authors of all bills in which Bothwell had been accused : and, as if to complete his triumph, Mary now selected him to bear the crown and sceptre before her when she \u00bb Drury to Cecil.

Mary willingly agreed to abol ish all laws affecting the lives of her subjects, on the score of their religion, she passed an act se curing a provision to the poorer ministers ; and it is likely more would have been granted if their assembly had refrained from recommending a rigid enquiry into the king's murder, which she resented and declined.2 So completely did she espouse the cause of her profligate favourite, that although all already dreaded his power, he now received from her the lordship and castle of Dunbar, with an enlarge ment of his office of High Admiral, and it was evident, that by the favour of the crown, and his \" Bands\" with the greater nobles, he had shot up to a strength which none would dare to resist.3 Mur ray, from his power and popularity was the only man who could have opposed him, but he now shunned the contest.

On the evening of the day on which the parliament rose (April 19), Bothwell invited the principal nobi lity to supper, in a tavern kept by a person named 1 MS. Letter, St. P. Off. B. C.

Of the guests some were his sworn friends, others were terrified and irreso lute ; and in the confusion one nobleman, the Earl of Eglinton, contrived to make his escape ; but the rest, both Papist and Protestant, were over awed into compliance, and affixed their signatures to a Bond, in which they declared their conviction of Bothwell's innocence, and recommended \" this noble and mighty lord \" as a suitable husband for the queen, whose continuance in solitary widow hood they declared was injurious to the interests of the commonwealth. The most influential persons who signed this disgraceful instrument were the Earls of Morton, Argile, Huntly, Cassillis, Suther land, Glencairn, Rothes, and Caithness ; and of the lords, Herries, Hume, Boyd, Seton and Sinclair.2 The perfection to which the system of paid in formers was now carried in Scotland, and the rapid 1 Anderson, vol. iv. p. 60.

A divorce between Bothwell and his countess, Lady Jane Gordon, was procured with indecent haste, and it was suspected that the recent restoration of his consistorial rights to the Archbishop of St. Andrew's, had been made with this object. The process was hurried through the Court of that Prelate, and the Commissariat or reformed court, in two days.1 After a brief resi dence at Dunbar, under the roof of the man ac cused of the murder of her husband, and the forcible seizure of her person, the queen and Bothwell rode to the capital.2 As she entered the town, his followers cast away their spears, to save themselves, as was conjectured, from any charge of treason, and their master, with apparent courtesy, dismounting, took the queen's bridle, and led her into the castle under a salvo of artillery.3 It was a sight which her friends beheld with the deepest sorrow, and her enemies with triumph and derision. A few days after this, Sir Robert Melvil, who had joined the coalition for the revenge of the king's murder and the delivery of the queen, wrote secretly to Cecil.

We see clearly from them that the formidable coalition against the queen, which our historians describe as arising after the marriage with Bothwell, was fully formed nearly a month before that event, that its rami fications were extensive and deep, that Sir Robert Melvil, in whom the Scottish queen reposed im plicit confidence, had joined the confederacy, in the hope of rescuing his royal mistress from what he represents as an unwilling servitude ; that the plot was well known to Monsieur de Croc, the French ambassador, who after having in vain remonstrated 1 Copy of the time, St. P.

But the English princess cherished high and peculiar ideas of prerogative, and while she blamed in severe terms the conduct of the Scot tish queen, she was incensed at the bold and scurrilous tone in which Grange had dared to arraign the proceedings of his sovereign. Upon this point, a remarkable conversation took place between her and Randolph in the palace garden, of which, fortunately, this minister on the same day that it occurred, wrote an account to Leicester. His expressions are forcible. \" These news,\" said he (meaning Mary's intended marriage), \" it pleased her majesty to tell me this day (May 10th) walking in her garden, with great misliking of that queen's doing, which now she doth so much detest, that she is ashamed of her. Notwithstanding her majesty doth not like, that her subjects should by any force withstand that which they do see her bent unto, and yet doth she greatly fear, lest that Bothwell having the upper hand, he will rein again with the French, and either make away with the prince, or send him into France, which deliberation her ma jesty wrould gladly have stayed, but is very uncer tain how it may be brought to pass. \" Her majesty also told me that she had seen a writing sent from Grange to my Lord of Bedford, despitefully written against that queen, in such vile i 2"], [142, "116 1567- HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. terms as she could not abide the hearing of it, wherein he made her worse than any common woman.

In this manner of talk, it pleased her majesty to retain me almost an hour.\"1 It is now time that we return to the extraordi nary course of events in Scotland, which fulfilled the predictions of Melvil and Grange. The church was ordered to proclaim the banns of the queen's marriage. This they peremptorily refused. Craig, one of the ministers, Knox being now absent, alleged as his excuse, that Mary had sent no writ ten command, and stated the common report that she had been ravished, and was kept captive by Bothwell. Upon this, the Justice Clerk brought him a letter signed by the queen herself, asserting the falsehood of such a story, and requiring his obe dience. He still resisted, demanded to be confronted 1 This Letter has never before been published, but is printed in the Appendix to the anonymous privately printed work already mentioned, entitled \" Maitland's Narrative.

To the accusa tion no satisfactory answer was returned, but Craig, having exonerated his conscience, did not deem himself entitled to disobey the express command of his sovereign. He therefore proclaimed the banns in the High Church, but from* the pulpit, and in presence of the congregation, added these appalling words : \" I take heaven and earth to witness, that I abhor and detest this marriage, as odious and slanderous to the world, and I would exhort the faithful to pray earnestly that a union against all reason and good conscience, may yet be over ruled by God, to the comfort of this unhappy realm.\"1 This solemn warning, with the deep and general detestation of Bothwell, appeared to produce so little effect upon the queen, that the people con sidered the whole events as strange and supernatu ral ; the report revived of this abandoned man having employed witchcraft, no uncommon resource in that age, and it was currently asserted, that the marriage day had been fixed by sorcerers.2 On the 12th of May, Mary came in person into 1 Anderson, vol. iv., p. 280.

Having understood, she said, that some doubts had been entertained by the lords, whether they ought to sit for the admi nistration of the laws, their sovereign being de tained in captivity at Dunbar by Lord Bothwell, she informed them that they might now dismiss their scruples, for although at first incensed at the conduct of that nobleman in the seizure of her per son, she had forgiven him his offence in consequence of his subsequent good conduct, and meant to promote him to still higher honour.1 On the same day, accord ingly, he was created Duke of Orkney and Shet land, the queen with her own hands placing the coronet on his head,2 and on the 15th of May, the marriage took place at four in the morning in the presence chamber at Holyrood. It was remarked that Mary was married in her mourning weeds. The ceremony was performed after the rite of the Protestant church by the Bishop of Orkney ; Craig, the minister of Edinburgh, being also present.

Of this last atrocious imputation, indeed, no direct proof was yet brought or offered ; but even if we dismiss it as absolutely false, was any mother who acted such a part worthy to be entrusted with the keeping and education of the heir to the throne ? So deeply felt were these considerations, that, as we have seen, a coalition for the destruction of Bothwell, and the preservation of the prince, was now widely organised in Scotland. Of this con federacy Lethington was secretly a member, although he still remained at Dunbar with the queen. Becoming suspected by Bothwell, how ever, this baron and his associate Huntly had resolved on his death, when Mary threw herself between them, and declared that if a hair of his head perished, it should be at the peril of their life and lands. Thus preserved, he continued his intrigues, and only waited a favourable opportunity to make his escape and join his friends.2 The plans 1 Melvil' s Memoirs, pp. 176, 177. 2 MS. Letter, St. P. Off.

France encouraged them ; and Robert Melvil and Grange, two leading men in the confederacy, had informed Cecil and Eliza beth of their intentions. Her answer was now anxiously expected. But this princess, at all times jealous of the royal prerogative, was startled when she understood that the combined lords had not only resolved to pro secute Bothwell for the murder, and to rescue the queen from his thraldom but to crown the prince.1 In reply to the picture they drew of the violent restraint put upon their sovereign, she informed them, that if Mary's own letters to herself were to be trusted, she was in no thraldom, but had consented to all that had happened ; she observed that \" to crown her son during his mother's life was a matter for example's sake not to be digested by her or any other monarch ;\" but she added, that if they would deliver the young prince into her hands to be kept in England, she felt inclined to support them. In the mean time the Earl of Bedford was ordered to hasten northward, that he might have an eye on their2 movements and afford them some encouragement, whilst Cecil her indefatigable minister had so craftily laid his spies about the court that he received in- 1 MS.

For a brief season after their marriage, the queen and the duke appeared to for get that they had an enemy ; and when Mary was informed of the private meetings of her opponents, she treated them with contempt ; \" Athol,\" said she, \" is but feeble, for Argile, I know well how to stop his mouth ; as for Morton, his boots are but new pulled off, (alluding to his recent return from banishment) and still soiled, he shall be sent back to his old quarters.1 In the mean time pageants and tourneys were got up to amuse the people ; who observed that their queen, casting off her \" mourning weed,\" assumed a gay dress, and frequently rode abroad with the duke, making a show of great contentment. Bothwell too was studious to treat her with respect, refusing to be covered in her presence, which she sometimes playfully resented, snatching his bonnet and putting it on his head f but there were times wiien his passi onate and brutal temper broke through all restraint ; and to those old friends who were still at court and saw her in private, it was evident, that though she still seemed to love him, she was a changed and miserable woman.

It is possi ble that this gentleman, who bore an honourable character in these times, may have considered, that in accepting this commission he should be able to serve his royal mistress ; and whilst he appeared the active agent of her enemies, might secretly check the violence of their designs and labour for her preservation. But whatever may have been his motives, it is certain that he availed himself of the confidence with which he was treated, to re veal her purposes to his confederates, and in the execution of his mission acted for both parties.

So completely was he judged to be in their interest, that Morton, the leader of the enterprise, described him to Elizabeth as their trusty friend, whom they had commissioned to declare their latent enterprise to her majesty.2 Bothwell's letter, which he sent by this envoy to Elizabeth is worthy of notice. It is expressed in a bold, almost a kingly tone ; he was aware, he said, of the queen's ill opinion of him, but he pro tested that it was undeserved, declared his re solution to preserve the amity between the two kingdoms, and professed his readiness to do her majesty all honour and service. Men of greater birth, so he concluded, might have been preferred to the high station he now occupied; none, he boldly affirmed, could have been chosen more zea lous for the preservation of her majesty's friend ship, of which she should have experience at any time it might be her pleasure to employ him.

It was judged time to declare themselves, and the contrast between their former and their present conduct was abun dantly striking. They who had combined with Bothwell in the conspiracy for the king's murder, and had signed the bond recommending him as a suitable husband for their queen, were now the loudest in their execration of the deed, and their denunciations of the marriage. It was necessary for them, however, from this very circumstance, to act with that caution which accomplices in guilt must adopt when they attempt to expose and punish a companion. If Morton, Argile, Huntly, Lethington and Balfour, possessed evidence to con vict Bothwell and his servants of the murder of the king, it was not to be forgotten that Bothwell could recriminate, and prove, by the production of the bond, that they had consented to the same crime.

Huntly, wiio had been much in her confidence, corresponded with her enemies.1 Lethington, the secretary, whom we have seen carried prisoner to Dunbar, pretended still to be devoted to her service, but betrayed all her pur poses to the confederate lords, and at length find ing a good opportunity, suddenly left the court. Murray it was said, had come to England, and taken a decided part against her, and Hume, one of the most warlike and powerful border lords, was active in his opposition.2 No army therefore could be assembled ; so detested indeed was Bothwell, that even the soldiers whom he had in pay, in curred his suspicion, and it was reported he only trusted one company, commanded by Captain Cul len, a man suspected to be deeply implicated in the king's murder.3 1 MS.

They were nearly a thousand strong, and along with him were Morton, Mar, Lindsay, Grange, and their followers, who deemed them selves sure of their prize, but Bothwell escaped through a postern in the back wall, to Haddington ; Here he remained a day in concealment, and then reached Dunbar, where he was next day joined by the queen, who fled in man's apparel, booted and spurred from Borthwick, and thus eluded notice.1 Disappointed in their first attempt, the confederates marched to the capital, which they reached at four in the morning, broke open the gates, took pos session of the city, and published a proclamation, declaring that they had risen in arms to revenge the death of the king, and the forcible abduction of their sovereign.2 Here they were soon after joined by the Earl of Athol and the noted Le thington, a man who had belonged to all parties, 1 Sloane MSS.

This infamous man had, as we have seen, been deeply implicated in the murder, and was reported to have some secret papers regarding it in his keeping. His anticipated defection, there fore, gave new spirit to the party.1 Whilst such was the state of things in the city, Mary and Bothwell had assembled their followers at Dunbar, and such was the effect of the royal name, that many of the border barons and gen try deserted Hume, and joined the queen's camp.

They pretended, she said, to prosecute the duke her husband, for the king's murder, after he had been already fully acquit ted of the crime; they declared their resolution to rescue herself from captivity, but she was no captive as they who had themselves recommended her marriage with the duke well knew ; they had taken arms as they affirmed to defend the prince her son \u2014 but he was in their own hands, and how then could they think him in danger ? in short all was a mere cover for their treason, and this she trusted soon to prove by the aid of her faithful subjects on the persons of these unnatural rebels.1 Her next step was to entrench herself on Carberry-hill, within the old works which had been thrown up by the English army previous to the battle of Pinky.

Here madam, said Morton, is the true place where your grace should be, and here we are ready to defend and obey you as loyally as ever nobility of this realm did your pro genitors.\" So fully felt was this sentiment, that when some of the common soldiers began to utter opprobrious language, Grange drew his sword and compelled them into silence. Such was the extraordinary scene, which led to the escape of Bothwell, and it demands a mo ment's reflection. The confederate nobles had declared that their object in taking arms was, to bring this infamous man to justice, as the murderer of the king, yet at the moment when they had him in their power, he was permitted to escape. Nothing could appear more inconsist ent, and yet perhaps looking to the motives which have been already pointed out, it will not be greatly alarmed, and at last asked the queen whether she would keep the promise of fidelity which she had made to him. She answered yes, and gave him her hand upon it.

He, indeed, was the principal murderer, but Morton, Huntly, Lethington, and Argile, were aware, that if driven to his defence, he could bring them in as accomplices. They allowed him to escape, because he was infinitely more easily dealt with as a fugitive than as a pri soner. But to return to Mary. Encouraged by the first appearances of courtesy, she declared her wish to communicate with the Hamiltons, who, the night before, had advanced in considerable strength to Linlithgow. This was peremptorily refused, upon which she broke into reproaches, appealed to their promise, and demanded how they dared to treat her as a prisoner? Her questions and her arguments were unheeded, and she now bitterly re pented her precipitation. Her spirit, however, instead of being subdued, was rather roused by their base ness. She called for Lindsay, one of the fiercest of the confederate barons, and bad him give her his hand. He obeyed. \" By the hand,\" said she, \" which is now in yours, I'll have your head for this.\" ' Unfortunate princess ! When she spoke thus, little did she know how soon that unrelent ing hand, which had been already stained with Riccio's blood, would fall still heavier yet upon herself.

The populace, as she rode through the streets, received her with yells and execra tions, the women pressing round, accused her in coarse terms as an adultress stained with her husband's blood ; and the soldiers, unrestrained by their officers, kept constantly waving before her eyes the banner on which was painted the mur dered king, and the prince crying for vengeance. At first they shut her up in the provost's house, where she was strictly guarded. It was in vain she remonstrated against this breach of faith ; in vain she implored them to remember that she was their sovereign : they were deaf to her entreaties, and she was compelled to pass the night, secluded even from her women, in solitude and tears. But the morning only brought new horrors. The first object which met her eyes was the same dreadful banner, which, with a refinement in cruelty, the populace had hung up directly opposite her win dows. The sight brought on an agony of despair and delirium, in the midst of which she tore the dress from her person, and, forgetting that she was al most naked, attempted in her phrenzy to address the people.2 This piteous spectacle could not be seen without producing an impression in her favour, 1 Letter of John Beaton to his Brother, Sloane MSS.

Here a hurried consultation was held, and in the evening she was sent a prisoner to Lochleven, a castle situated in the midst of a lake, belonging to Douglas, one of the confederates, and from which escape was deemed impossible. In her journey thi ther, she was treated with studied indignity, exposed to the gaze of the mob, miserably clad, mounted on a sorry hackney, and placed under the charge of Lindsay and Ruthven, men of savage manners, even in this age, and who were esteemed peculiarly fitted for the task.1 Against this base conduct, it is said, that Grange loudly remonstrated, and that, to si lence his reproaches, the lords produced an inter cepted letter, written by the queen from her prison in Edinburgh to Bothwell, in which she assured him that she would never desert him. The story is told by Melvil, but I have found no trace of it, and Grange had already manifested such bitter hostility to his sovereign, that his sincerity may be questioned, especially as he continued to act with his former associates.2 Thus far the measures of the confederates were crowned with success. The queen was a prisoner in their hands ; they were possessed of the person of the heir apparent, who had been committed to the governance of Mar, one of their principal leaders ; 1 Id. Ibid.

Bothwell was a fugitive, and they were sustained in every thing they had done by the support of the min isters of the Reformed Church, and by the general voice of the people. For the present, therefore, all was deemed secure, and on considering their future policy, they determined to pause till it was seen with what feelings the late events were regarded by Eng land and France. With this view they lost no time in despatching letters, first to Elizabeth, and after a little interval to the King of France. To the Eng lish queen they declared that their only motive in taking up arms had been the punishment of the king's murder ; they assured her, that so soon as this was accomplished, their sovereign should be restored to freedom, and as for the coronation of the young prince, that such an idea had never been contemplated. In conclusion, they expressed a hope that she would consider their want of money, and send them the sura of three or four thousand crowns to hire soldiers, in return for which they were ready to refuse the offers of France, and sub mit to be wholly guided by England.1 To France their letters were full of amity, but more general and guarded.

They at the same time entered into communication with Murray and the Earl of Lennox, whose pre sence they required in Scotland.2 At this crisis (June 20), according to the evi dence of Cecil's journal, which has been, on insuf ficient grounds, I think, suspected of forgery, the lords of the secret council, through the treachery of a servant of Bothwell's, became possessed of a box or casket, which was said to contain some private letters and sonnets addressed by the queen to the duke. This was that celebrated silver casket, which afterwards made so much noise, and in which, as asserted by the enemies of Mary, were found decided proofs of her guilt.

It is, however, to be remembered that Morton, Lethington, and Sir James Balfour, the three great leaders of the confederacy, were themselves deeply implicated in the assassination of Darnley, and that they would be exceedingly likely to sup press such a discovery, till the contents of the casket were rigidly examined. They knew that Bothwell was in possession of the bond for the king's murder, and the casket might contain it, or other papers equally conclusive. It is certain, that on the day of this reported discovery (June 20), Morton and his associates despatched George Douglas, one of the most confidential of their num ber, on a secret mission to the Earl of Bedford, and it is possible his message may have related to it.1 In this mysterious state we must leave the matter at present. On hearing of the late extraordinary events in Scotland, Elizabeth's feelings were of a divided kind. Her ideas of the inviolability of the royal prerogative, were offended by the imprisonment of the queen. However great were Mary's faults, or even her guilt, it did not accord with the high creed of the English princess, that any subjects should dare to expose or punish them, and we have seen, that in a former conversation with Randolph, she alluded to Grange's letters to Bedford, in terms of 1 MS.

Nor was she ignorant that the able and crafty men who directed their proceedings, had de termined to refuse every petition for the restoration of their sovereign to liberty, an event probably as much deprecated by Elizabeth as by themselves.2 It was perfectly safe for the English queen there fore, to give fair promises to Mary, and to remon strate with the confederates upon this subject. Such being her views, she despatched Robert Melvil, who was then in England, with a letter to his mis tress, and ordered Sir Nicholas Throkmorton, one of her ablest diplomatists, to hold himself in readi ness to proceed on a mission to Scotland. Meanwhile the lords of the secret council, who had suffered the principal actor in the king's murder to escape, became active in their search for inferior delinquents. Captain Cullen, a daring follower of Bothwell's, had been seized on their first advance to Edinburgh, and soon after two others, Captain Blacater, and Sebastian de Villours, were appre hended. The foreigner was soon discharged, but 1 Randolph to Leicester, May 10, 1567. See supra, p. 60. 2 Gonzalez Apuntamientos, p. 322.

Blacater was tried for the murder, convicted, and executed before an immense concourse of specta tors, who eagerly surrounded the scaffold. To their disappointment he died solemnly calling God to wit ness his innocence, and revealed no particulars.1 Of Cullen, who, it was reported, on his apprehension, had discovered the whole details of the conspiracy, we hear no more. It is possible, he may have been commanded to say nothing, because he might have told too much. These efforts of the confederates to bring the guilty to justice, did not satisfy the people ; it was suspected that amongst their leaders, were some who dreaded any strict examination, and Morton and Lethington, distrusting the fickle nature of the lower classes, began to dread a re-action in the queen's favour. This was the more alarming, as the rival faction of the Hamiltons had recently mustered in great strength. The head of this party was nominally the Duke of Chastelherault, now in France, but really his brother the Archbishop of St. Andrew's. Failing Mary and her son, the duke was next heir to the throne, and he and his advisers had acuteness enough to penetrate into the views of Morton and his party. They saw clearly that the consequence of the continued captivity of their sove reign, must be the coronation of the young prince, his protection by Elizabeth, and the establishment 1 MS.

Having been generally opposed to Mary and her marriage, her captivity was not in itself a matter which gave them any very deep con cern, but in weighing the two evils, its continu ance and a regency, or her restoration and a third marriage, they chose what they thought the least, and determined to make an effort for her re storation. For this purpose, a convention of the lords of their party was held at Dumbarton (June 29), and proclamation made for all good subjects to be ready on nine hours warning to take arms for the delivery of the queen.1 They were here joined by Argile and Huntly, who had deserted the con federates, by Herries, a baron of great power, and vigour of character, and by Crawford, with the Lords Seaton and Fleming, whilst the Archbishop of St. Andrew's, and the celebrated Lesly, Bishop of Ross, directed their councils.2 Their deliberations were watched and reported to his court by de Croc, the French ambassador, who found them as 1 MS.

Here, indeed, was their strongest hold ; for the reformed clergy were sternly opposed to the queen, they firmly be lieved that she was participant in the king's mur der, and they possessed the highest influence with the people. On their taking possession of the capital, immedi ately after their unsuccessful attempt at Borthwick, Glencairn, one of the fiercest zealots of these times, had signalized his hatred of popery by an attack upon the royal chapel at Holyrood, in which he demolished the altar, and destroyed the shrines and images. This attack, although condemned by some of the party, was not unwelcome to the minis ters, and on the 25th of June, an assembly of the church was held at Edinburgh. In this meeting of his friends and brethren, John Knox re-appeared. This great leader of the Reformed Church, had fled, as we have seen,2 from the capital, imme diately after the assassination of Riccio, and had deemed it unsafe to return, till the queen was imprisoned in Lochleven.

In his retirement, he appears to have lost no thing of his wonted fire. He was animated by the same stern, uncompromising, and unscrupulous spirit as before, and the crisis appeared to him to be highly favourable for the complete demolition of popery, and the permanent establishment of the Protestant faith. Henceforward we must regard him as the leader of the Reformed Church, and upon certain conditions he declared himself ready to give his cordial assistance to the confederates. He stipulated that they should recognize the par liament held at Edinburgh in 1560, and its acts as laws of the realm. It will be recollected, that this was the famous parliament in which popery had been overthrown, and the reformed religion estab lished, and that notwithstanding all the efforts of Elizabeth and the Protestants, Mary had never given her consent to its decrees. The confede rates, who were mostly, if not all, Protestants, of course experienced no such scruples, but em- J Me Crie's Life of Knox, vol. ii., p. 150. 2 MS. Letter, St. P. Off. B. C.

They agreed to restore the patrimony of the church which had been seized and devoted to civil uses, to entrust the education of youth in all colleges and public seminaries to the reformed clergy, to put down idolatry (so they denominated the Roman Catholic faith) by force of arms, if ne cessary, to watch over the education of the prince, committing him to some godly and grave governor, and to punish to the uttermost the murderers of the king.1 In return for this, Knox adopted the cause of the lords of the Secret Council (such was the title by which the confederacy against Mary and Bothwell was now known), with all the energy belonging to his character. From former experi ence, none knew better than this extraordinary man the strength of popular opinion when once roused, and few understood better how to rouse it by that style of pulpit eloquence which he had adopted : \u2014 earnest, sententious, satyrical, col loquial, often coarse, but always to the point, and always successful. There can be little doubt, I think, that the great secondary cause of the estab lishment of the Reformation in Scotland was the force of popular opinion, roused, directed, and kept in continual play, by the sermons and addresses of the clergy. Such an engine was not permitted in 1 Knox : Hist. p. 449. Spottiswood, p. 210. MS. Letter, St. P. Off. Drury to Cecil, B. C. Berwick, June 25, 1567. Also MS. Letter, B. C. June 27, 1567.

To enforce this, Knox, with three colleagues, Douglas, Row, and Craig, waited upon them, and urged the necessity of their attendance, that they might labour for the re-establishment of the policy and patrimony of the Church. But the Hamiltons suspected the overtures, and the secret council, who dreaded lest delay should give strength to their enemies, determined to compel the queen to abdi cate the government in favour of the prince her son. The known character of Mary, however, ren dered this daring resolution a matter of no easy accomplishment. Her confinement in Lochleven had been accompanied with circumstances of great rigour ; she was there placed under the charge of Lindsay and Ruthven, men familiar with blood, and of coarse and fierce manners. The lady of the castle, Margaret Erskine, daughter of Lord Erskine, had been mistress to the queen's father, James V., and was mother to the Earl of Mur- 1 MS. Letter, St. P. Off. B. C. Berwick.

She had been afterwards married to Sir Robert Douglas ; and their son, William Douglas, who was proprietor of the castle, had early joined the confederacy. She herself is said to have been a woman of a proud and imperious spirit, and was accustomed to boast that she was James's lawful wife, and her son Murray, his legitimate issue, who had been supplanted by the queen.1 Under such superintendents, Mary could not ex pect a lenient captivity ; but her spirit was un broken, though Villeroy, a gentleman sent to her by the king of France, was denied all access, and it became impossible for her to receive advices of the proceedings of the Hamiltons, from the strict ness with which all communication was cut off.2 She had sent, as we have seen, Robert Melvil on a mission to the English queen soon after her mar riage. During his stay in England those sad cala mities had occurred, with which we are acquainted ; and now that she was a prisoner, shut out from all friendly intercourse, and fed only with the deferred hopes that sicken the heart, she looked anxiously for his return. But this servant had, as we have seen, become the envoy of her enemies. During his stay in England, he had acted as the secret agent of the confederate lords, who had imprisoned her ; he solicited money to support them in their en terprise ; he received orders from them to supply 1 Keith, p. 403. * MS.

At the same time she was ready to lend her countenance and assistance for the prose cution of the king's murder, and the preservation of the young prince. In conclusion, Throkmorton was enjoined to declare to the Scottish queen, the charges with which she was loaded by her subjects, and to hear her answers and defence.1 On crossing the border, the ambassador was met by Lethington, the secretary, at Coldinghame, who conducted him to Fascastle, a strong fortalice overhanging the German Ocean.2 Here he was received by Hume, the lord of the castle, with Sir James Melvil; and in a conference, held with the Scottish secretary, it was soon apparent that he had to deal with those who were as crafty, cautious, and diplomatic as himself or his mistress.

Already they complained that she had departed from her first promises to Robert Melvil, and had sent a cold answer to their last letter, and as for her proposal to set their sovereign at liberty, if sincere in this, it was plain (they said) that the queen of England sought their ruin, for wTere Mary once free, it would be absurd to talk of the prosecution of the murder, or indeed of any other condition. Touching their intended policy to France, a subject upon which Elizabeth was exceedingly jealous, Throkmorton found them resolved to hold, for the present, the same cautious course which they pursued to England, neither positively refusing nor accepting the overtures of the French king. These, indeed, as Lethington reported them to the English ambassador, were of an extraordinary description, and if Mary ow*ed little gratitude to Elizabeth, she was certainly still less obliged to her royal relatives at that court whose exertions at this moment were strenuously devoted to the setting up a party in Scotland composed of her enemies, the confederate lords. In accomplishing this, they were ready to sacrifice the captive queen.

Elphinston arrived in London a few days after Throkmorton's departure for Scotland. He was there admitted to a secret interview with Eliza beth, which lasted for an hour, and his commu nication had the effect of rendering her more favour able to Mary, and more hostile to the confederate lords. There is a curious piece of secret history connected with the interview between this envoy of Murray and Elizabeth, which is to be found in 1 Robertson's Appendix, No. XXI.

This person was in waiting in the ante-cham- ber of the palace, when Elizabeth, after dismissing Murray's messenger, called him hastily and sent him to Cecil. He was directed by her to inform the prime minister that Murray had dispatched his servant with letters to the Queen of Scotland, expressive of his attachment, and offering his service ; that they were to be delivered to her own hands, and not to be seen by the confederates ; and that he had in charge also to remonstrate with them for their audacity in imprisoning their sovereign. But this was not all. The rest of the commission given by the English queen to Heneage, is still more interesting in furnishing us with an admission from her own lips of that insi- dious dealing which so often marked her policy. Tell Cecil, said she, that he must instantly write a letter, in my name, to my Sister, to which I will set my hand, for I cannot write it myself, as I have not \"used her well and faithfully in these broken matters that be past.

On the contrary, he had declared himself against them, and was resolved to sup port and defend the queen his sovereign. But to return to Throkmorton. This ambassa dor proceeded from Fascastle to the capital, ac companied by Lord Hume, and an escort of four hundred horse. The day after his arrival (July 13) there was a solemn fast held by the Reformed Church, the leaders of which were decided enemies of the Scottish Queen, and his first impressions gave him little hope, either that he would be permitted to visit the royal captive, or be able to do her much good.1 Nor did the confe derate lords seem in any haste to have a con ference with him, and when he accidentally met their leader, Morton, he excused himself from en tering upon business, as the day was devoted to sacred exercises. Lethington, however, came to him in the evening, and from the tone of his con versation, it was apparent to the ambassador, that they were determined he should not be allowed to see Mary. They had already, he said, refused the French ambassador, and in the present state of things, they did not chuse to irritate France. As to the probable fate of the unhappy prisoner, Throkmorton found all things looking gloomily. Her 1 Throkmorton to the Queen. Edinburgh, 14 July, 1567.

Herries, though more attached to her ser vice, was not to be trusted when his own interests came in the way, the French king and the queen mother were ready to desert her, if they could gain the confederates, and singular as the fact may appear to those who have given credit to the attacks of his opponents, her only true friend, at this moment, was the Earl of Murray. He had despatched Elphin ston, as we have seen, to visit Mary and assure her of his services, and this envoy arrived in the capital much about the same time with Throk morton. But when he requested to have access to the queen, and deliver his letters, he received a peremptory denial.1 It has been often asserted, and very commonly believed, that from the first rising of the lords against Mary and Bothwell, Murray was one of their party, in active corre- 1 Throkmorton to Elizabeth, 18th July, 1567.

But of all the enemies of the miserable queen, the most bitter were the Presbyterian clergy and the people. In the midst of their austerity and devotional exercises, the ministers expressed themselves with deep indigna tion against her, and looked forward with anxious interest to their great ecclesiastical council, which was to be held in eight days, and in which they had determined that the whole matter connected with the murder and her imprisonment should be debated. The more that Throkmorton investigated the state of parties during this interval, the more he became convinced of the hopelessness of his own interference, and the imminent peril of Mary. So far were the people from listening with any patience to the doctrines of passive obedience, which Elizabeth had instructed him to inculcate, that they took their stand on the very opposite ground, the responsibility of the prince, and the power of the nation to call their sovereign to ac count for any crimes she might have committed. \" It is a public speech among all the people (so wrote the ambassador to Elizabeth), that their queen hath no more liberty nor privilege to commit murder nor adultery, than any other private per son, neither by God's laws nor by the laws of the VOL.

Knox, Craig, and the other minis- ters of the Reformed Church, considered the pulpit and the press as the lawful vehicles of their poli- tical as well as their religious opinions, and the cele- brated Buchanan, who had joined the confederates, enforced the same doctrines with uncommon vigour and ability. Their arguments were grounded on the examples of wicked princes in the Old Tes- tament who were deposed and put to death for their idolatry, and on alleged but disputable pre- cedents in their own history of similar severity exercised by subjects against their sovereigns.2 In consequence of all these efforts, the few friends who had at first ventured to defend the Scottish queen were silenced and intimidated, and the public mind became inflamed to such a state of madness and fury, that she began to think of saving her life by retiring to a nunnery in France, or living with the old Duchess of Guise.3 At this moment Robert Melvil was for the third time sent by the confederates to Lochleven, in structed to make a last effort to prevail upon his mis tress to renounce Bothwell. By him Throkmorton found an opportunity to convey a letter, in which he 1 Throkmorton to Elizabeth, July 18, 1567. Robertson, Ap pendix, No. XXII. 2 Ibid. a St. P. Off.

The queen, who believed herself to be with child, declared her firm resolution rather to die than desert her hus band, and declare her child illegitimate. She re quested Melvil, at the same time, to deliver a letter to the lords which implored them to have consideration of her health, and to change the place of her imprisonment to Stirling, where she might have the comfort of seeing her son. She was willing, she said, to commit the government of the realm, either to the Earl of Murray alone, or to a council of the nobility, and proposed, that if they would not obey her as their queen, they should regard her with some favour as the mother of their prince, and the daughter of their king. To this interview between Mary and Melvil no one was admitted, and before he took his leave she produced a letter, requesting him to convey it to Bothwell. This he peremptorily refused, upon which she threw it angrily into the fire.2 On his return to the capital, he found the ani mosity against the queen at its height, and the English ambassador in despair of being able to restrain it from some fatal excess. Many openly declared that no power, either within or without the realm, should preserve her from that signal punishment which her notorious crimes deserved. 1 Robert Melvil's Declaration.

Others, more moderate, proposed to restore her to the royal dignity, if she consented to divorce Bothwell ; some advised that she should resign in favour of the prince, who might govern by a council, whilst she retired for life to France. This was Athol's scheme, and not disliked by Morton, but to the majority of the privy council it was unacceptable. They deemed it indispensable that Mary should be publicly arraigned and condemned to perpetual imprisonment as guilty of the king's murder, whilst some went so far as to insist that she should not only be condemned and degraded, but put to death.1 When such was the state of public feeling, the General Assembly of the Church convened in Edin burgh.2 The Protestant clergy had already en tered into a strict coalition with Morton and the lords of the Secret Council, who now held the whole power of the government, and the proceed ings of their ecclesiastical tribunal partook of the rigorous and uncompromising character of Knox and Buchanan, its leaders. It was argued that the queen was guilty of crimes for which she ought to forfeit her life,and there seemed to be every prob ability that this dreadful result was about to take place, had it not been for the interference of Throkmorton, who, with the utmost earnestness, 1 Caligula, C. i. sol. 18.

Mary had (as we have seen), already intimated her readiness to resign the government to the Earl of Murray. It was now resolved to follow up the idea, and for this purpose, Lord Lindsay, who had left Lochleven to attend the General Assem bly, was despatched thither in company with Robert Melvil. From this nobleman, one of the fiercest zealots of his party, Mary had everything to dread : her passionate menace to him on the day she was taken prisoner at Carberry had not been forgotten, and he was now selected as a man whom she would hardly dare to resist. He carried with him three instruments drawn up by the Lords in their sovereign's name. By the first she was made to demit the government of the realm in favour of her son, and to give orders for his immediate coronation. By the second, she, in consequence of his tender infancy, consti tuted her \" dear brother,\" the Earl of Murray, Regent of the realm, and by the third she ap pointed the duke, with the Earls of Lennox, Ar gile, Athol, Morton, Glencairn, and Mar, regents of the kingdom till the return of Murray from France, with power to continue in that high office, if he refused it.2 Before Lindsay was admitted, Melvil had a pri- 1 MS.

It is certain, that had she proved obstinate the lords were resolved to bring her to a public trial ; that they spoke with the utmost confidence of her con viction for the king's murder, and affirmed that they possessed proof of her guilt in her own hand writing.\" These threats and assertions were in all probability communicated to his royal mistress by Melvil ; and he insinuated that she ought to be the less scrupulous, as any deed signed in captivity, and under fear of her Use, was invalid. He brought a message to the same purpose from Athol and Lethington, and a letter from Throkmorton. It was a trying moment for Mary; and for a short time she resisted every intreaty, declaring passionately that she would sooner renounce her life than her crown ; but when Lindsay was ad mitted, his stern demeanour at once terrified her into compliance. He laid the instruments before her, and with eyes filled with tears, and a trem bling hand she took the pen and signed the papers without even reading their contents.2 It was ne cessary, however, that they should pass the privy seal, and here a new outrage was committed. The keeper, Thomas Sinclair, remonstrated, and declared that the queen being in ward, her resig nation was ineffectual ; Lindsay attacked his house, 1 MS.

The English ambassador, however, gave a peremp tory refusal. Their whole proceedings, he said, had been contrary to the advice, and in contempt of the remonstrances of his mistress.2 The Hamiltons also declined ; not, as they commissioned Melvil to in form the confederate lords, on the ground of their being enemies ; so far from this they thanked them for their gentle message, but simply because, from the first, they had been made no party to their intentions. It was their wish also, they said, to pre sent a protest, that this coronation should not be prejudicial to the title of the Duke of Chastelhe rault as next heir to the crown ; and their request having been granted, they professed to offer no opposition.3 It was determined that the coronation should be held in the High Church at Stirling, and thither i We owe the discovery of this fact to Mr. Riddell, in a paper published in \" Blackwood's Magazine,\" for October, 1817. 2 Throkmorton to Elizabeth, Edinburgh, 26 July, 1567.

The clergy, of whom Knox was the great leader, insisted that the king should not be anointed, but simply crowned, anointing being a Jewish rite, and abrogated by the gospel dispensa tion. Against this notion it was argued that the custom was not a superstitious relic, but an ancient solemnity recognised by the general usage of Chris tendom ; and after a bitter contest, the objection was overruled, and the ceremonial proceeded, every endeavour having been made on the part of the lords to make it as solemn and magnificent as possi ble. In the procession Athol bore the crown, Mor ton the sceptre, and Glencairn the sw*ord, whilst Mar, his governor, carried the infant prince in his arms into the church. The deeds of resignation by the queen were read ; and Lindsay, and Ruthven, on their oath testified that they were voluntary. Knox then preached the sermon, the crown was placed on the king's head by the Bishop of Ork ney, Morton laying his hand on the Gospels, took the oaths on behalf of his sovereign, that he should maintain the reformed religion and extir pate heresy ; the lords swore allegiance, placing their hands on his head ; the burgesses followed, and in conclusion, the Earl of Mar lifted the monarch from the throne and carried him back to his nursery in the castle.1 At night, in the 1 Throkmorton to Elizabeth, Edinburgh, 31 July, 1567, Ste venson, p. 257.

A small section of the nobles and the gentry, unsupported by foreign aid, with a handful of soldiers,2 at no time exceed ing four hundred men, opposed by the highest of the aristocracy, and threatened with the hostility of England and France, were seen to rise with appalling suddenness and strength. They dispel their enemies ; they imprison their sovereign ; they hesitate whether she shall not be openly arraigned and executed ; they compel her to resign her regal authority ; and they now, finally, place the crown on the head of her son, an infant of a year old, and possess themselves of the whole power of the government. If we look for the cause of this extraordinary success, it is to be traced chiefly, if not altogether, to the unhappy infatuation and imprudence of the queen. It was this that sepa rated her friends, strengthened the hands of her enemies, gave ample field for the worst suspicions, and alienated from her the hearts and sympathy of the people. But to return. The first intelligence of these events was re ceived with the utmost indignation by Elizabeth. She had already instructed Throkmorton to re monstrate with the lords, she had warned him to 1 Throkmorton to Elizabeth, July 31, 1567. 2 By \" soldiers,\" is here meant regular waged troops."], [196, "170 1567.

She now interdicted him from holding any farther intercourse, as her ambassa dor, with men who had treated her with such dis courtesy and contempt, and declared \" that she would make herself a party against them to the revenge of their sovereign, and an example to all posterity.\"1 When her letters were delivered, the principal leaders, Morton, Mar, Glencairn, Hume and Leth ington, had come to Edinburgh, to await the ar rival of Murray, to whom they had dispatched an envoy, informing him of his having been chosen regent. Throkmorton, in obedience to his mistress's commands, kept aloof; but Tullibardin, the comp troller, and brother-in-law to the Earl of Mar, one of the interim regents, volunteered a visit ; and in the course of conversation on the late events, un veiled a scene of treachery upon the part of the Hamiltons, who had hitherto supported the queen, which filled him with horror. The two great leaders of this party were the Archbishop of St. Andrew's, and the Abbot of Kilwinning ; and when the Eng lish ambassador remonstrated upon the violence of the recent proceedings, and threatened the lords of the secret council with hostility upon the part of Eli zabeth, he was solemnly assured that a perseverance in such a course, was the certain way to shorten Mary's life.

Throkmorton at first expressed his utter disbe lief that any men who had hitherto borne a fair character could be guilty of such atrocious and cold blooded treachery. He argued also on the point of expediency, that more profit might be made of the queen's life than of her death. She might be divorced from Bothwell and afterwards marry a son of the duke's, or a brother of Argile's. To this Tullibardin's answer was remarkable. \" My lord ambassador,\" said he, \" these matters you speak of have been in question amongst them, but now they see not so good an outgait L by any of those devices as by the queen's death.

I think it right as these are new facts in this part of our history, involving a charge of unwonted perfidy even in this age, to give the particulars of this extraordinary conversation in the words of the am bassador to Elizabeth. \" The same day,\" said he, (he is describing the events of the 7th of August) \" the Lord of Lethington came to visit me on behalf of all the lords.

For the Hamiltons and you concur together; you have nothing in your mouths but liberty, and nothing less in your hearts. My Lord Ambassador, (he continued), I have heard what you have said unto me, I assure you, if you should use this speech unto them, which you do unto me, all the world could not save the queen's life three days to an end ; and as the case now standeth, it will be much ado to save her life.' \" I said, ' My Lord of Lethington, if you remember, I told you, at my first coming hither, when I un derstood you minded the coronation of her son, that when you had touched her dignity, you would touch her life shortly after. * * * ' Well, my Lord,' said he, ' I trust you do not take me to be one that doth thirst my sovereign's blood, or that would stain my conscience with the shedding of the same.

This morning the Bishop of St. Andrew's, and the Abbot of Kilwinning, have sent a gentle man unto us for that purpose. And likewise the Earl of Huntly hath sent Duncan Forbes, within this hour, to conclude with us upon the same ground, and to be plain with you, there be very few amongst ourselves which be of any other opinion.' \" Throkmorton then began to use persuasions to dissuade them from such a fearful extremity. Upon which Lethington assured him, that, as far as he himself was concerned, there needed no ar gument \u2014 but he added, emphatically, \" How can you satisfy men that the queen shall not be come a dangerous party against them in case she five and come to liberty.\" I said, \" Divorce her from Bothwell.\" He said, \" We cannot bring it to pass ; she will in no wise hear of the matter.\" The conversation was then broken off by Sir James Balfour coming in to carry Lethington to the council, who were waiting for him.1 It is clear, then, that at this moment the Hamil tons, instead of being friends to the unhappy queen, as they are represented in our popular historians, were acting towards her with treachery and cruelty ; they were ready to sacrifice her to their own dreams of ambition,2 and the life of Mary was in the most 1 MS.

To this remarkable man, on whose movements so much depended, all eyes were now turned, and his future conduct became the subject of much discussion. He had been elected regent. Would he accept this high office, which, considering the divided state of parties, brought with it so many difficulties ? What were his sentiments as to the extraordinary events which had lately taken place ? The deposition and captivity of his sovereign, the coronation of the prince, the remonstrances of England, the efforts of France, above all, the guilt and punishment of the queen, now so strongly urged by that party of the Reformed Church with whom he had hitherto acted ?

Morton and the lords of the Secret Council first planned that revolution (14th May), which ended so fatally to Mary, they had secretly communicated with him. The exact nature of that communi cation we know not, but it was reported that he approved of their designs, and a month later, after the imprisonment of the queen, they again entered into correspondence with him ; once more, about a fortnight later, and once again, after the resig nation of the queen, this correspondence was re newed. These facts are undoubtedly calculated to excite suspicion, and we are not to be surprised, if, in the heat of the controversy which has agitated this portion of our history, it has been argued from them that Murray not only approved of, but directed all the plans of the conspirators. But the enquirer after truth dares not advance so rapidly. All that is proved amounts to the fact, that the lords of the confederacy against Mary, from the first, were anxious to gain him. Indeed, his election to the re gency showed how far they were ready to go to se cure him \u2014 but of his answers to their letters we know nothing. It is also worthy of remark, that on the only occasion when we can detect a message sent to them by Murray, it was hostile to his reputed friends. Elphinston, whom we have seen deputed by him to communicate with his impri soned mistress and her captors, brought an assur ance of such comfort and loyalty to Mary, and so severe a remonstrance to the lords, that they in terdicted him from seeing the queen until they had"], [203, "1567 177 MARY made up their minds to depose her or to put her to death. Such a message could not have proceeded from an associate. On being informed of his election to the regency, Murray prepared to leave France, and his inten tions at this moment formed an object of the deep est interest to the court of England, and the Tuil leries. Elizabeth was naturally anxious to preserve the influence she had hitherto exerted in the affairs of Scotland. She considered her hold over the measures of that country as an essential part of the great system for the support of Protestantism in Europe. At the same time, however, she was highly incensed at the lords of the secret council for their deposition of their sovereign : their con duct, in her opinion, was insulting to the majesty of the crown, and destructive of all principles of good government, and as she had determined to exert herself to procure the liberty of the captive queen, she was anxious to secure Murray in the same service. Such were the feelings of Eliza beth. The court of France on the other hand, was equally anxious to preserve or rather to recover the influence it once held over Scotland, and at first the king declared that he would strain every effort to have Mary and the prince brought into his kingdom \u2014 but this idea was soon abandoned. The Scottish qUeen had never been a favourite with the queen mother, and provided they gained the confe derate lords, in whose hands at this moment was the VOL. VI.

High bribes were offered him before his departure, and when he resisted these entreaties, and it began to be rumoured that he leant to the side of England, every impediment was thrown in the way of his return.1 But such difficulties were overcome by his prudence and firmness. Without binding himself to France in any specific agreement, he assured the king of his desire to use every exertion for the deliverance of his sovereign, and left the court with Monsieur De Lignerolles, who was or dered to accompany him. Of this person the avowed object was, to carry a message from the French king to the lords of the secret council, but his real errand was, to watch the proceedings of the regent elect, and hurry him on to Scotland, without giving him time to communicate with Elizabeth.2 At this moment, when on the eve of leaving France, Murray was informed, probably by Elphinston, his own servant, of the alleged proofs of Mary's guilt, which had been discovered by her enemies in Scotland, his informant stating, that he had seen and read a letter of the Scottish queen to Bothwell, 1 MS.

At the same time this intelligence ne cessarily worked a change in Murray's feelings more favourable to the confederate lords, and more severe towards his sovereign, so that on his arrival at the English court, his interview with the queen was angry and unsatisfactory: Elizabeth expressed herself determined to restore the imprisoned queen, and to punish the audacious subjects who had de throned her. Against this dictatorial tone, Murray's spirit rose, and the queen, who expected implicit obedience, upbraided him with such severity, that she shook his affection towards England, a result much deplored by Bedford and Throkmorton. These able persons, and her chief minister Cecil, who were intimately acquainted with the state of the two parties, had earnestly enforced on the queen the necessity of leaving Mary to her fate, and encouraging the lords who had deposed her. They considered her cause to be desperate, and and they believed such a course to be the only 1 Gonzalez Apuntamientos, p. 323. From a Letter of Norris to Cecil. MS. St. P. Off. 23 July, 1567.

It was to the honour of Elizabeth that she repudiated this advice, refused to abandon the cause of the captive prin cess, and perceiving the change in Murray's mind, dismissed him with no kindly feeling.1 On the 8th of August he reached Berwick, ac companied by De Lignerolles. Here he was the guest of Bedford, his ancient friend and associate, and was met by tw7o envoys from the lords of the confederacy Sir James Makgill, lord clerk register, and the well known Sir James Melvil ; the first was the representative of that section who were most determined against the queen, the other was depu ted by that more moderate class, who wished to spare her life, and contemplated the possibility of her restitution. Both of these were fully able to inform him of the state of parties, and Makgill, who had been a principal actor in the deposition of his sovereign, and knew all that could be urged against her, explained to him their whole proceedings, and urged the absolute necessity of his accepting the regency. Murray, however, refused to commit him self, and pursuing his journey, was met at the Bound Rode, the line which separates the tw*o countries, by a troop of four hundred noblemen and gentlemen 1 MS.

It was only a year and a half before, that in this fatal house the conference had been held between Lethington, Bothwell, and Morton, in which the king's murder was determined. Bothwell was now a fugitive and an outlaw, but his associates in guilt, the same Lethington and Morton, now received Murray at Whittingham, and cordially sympathised with him, when he expressed his horror for the crime, and his resolution to avenge it. Aster a night's rest, the regent elect proceeded to the capital, which he entered next day, sur rounded by the nobility, and amid the acclama tions of the citizens. Here for two days he em ployed himself unremittingly in examining the state of the two factions, holding consultations with his friends, and acquiring the best information as to the difficulties he might have to encounter in ac cepting the high office which was offered him. He had already held an interview with Throkmorton, the English ambassador, who met him for this pur pose a few miles from Edinburgh, and to this able judge, who had no interest to blind him, Murray appeared to be acting with sincerity and honour \u2014 he was already aware of the general nature of De Lignerolles' message to the lords of the confede racy, and in the secret consultations which he held with these persons, the whole history of their pro ceedings must have been laid before him.

As to the diffi- culties of his situation, the faction of the Hamil- tons and the hostility of Elizabeth were the prin- cipal obstacles in his way ; but the first were divi- ded in their councils, and the English queen would soon, he. trusted, be induced by Cecil to remove her opposition. On the whole, he felt almost resolved to accept the regency, but one point made him still hesitate. The demission of the crown, the deeds which nominated himself, and sanctioned the coro- nation of the prince, were said to have been ex- torted from Mary. If true, this would vitiate his title to the office, and he requested permission to see the queen in Lochleven before he gave his final answer. This demand startled the lords, and some thought it would be injudicious to grant it. To Throkmorton, the English ambassador, he had ex pressed himself with great commiseration towards the captive princess, and they dreaded the conse quences of his pity or sympathy. At last, however, they consented, and on the 15th of August, Murray, in company with Morton, Athol, and Lord Lindsay, visited the queen in her prison. It was a remarkable and affecting inter view. Mary received them with tears, and pas-"], [209, "1567 183 MARY sionately complained of her wrongs. Then taking Murray aside, before supper, she eagerly questioned him as to the intentions of the lords, and in vain endeavoured to fathom his own. Contrary to his usual open and frank demeanour, he was gloomy, silent, and reserved. When the bitter meal had past, she again spoke to him in private, and torn by fear and suspense, pathetically described her suffer ings. He was her brother, she said, her only friend, he must know her fate, for he was all-powerful with her enemies ; would he now withhold his counsel and assistance in this extremity of her sorrow ? What was she to look for ? She knew some thirsted for her blood. In the end she implored him to keep her no longer in doubt, but to speak out, and even were it to criminate her, to use all freedom and plainness.1 Thus urged, Murray without mitigation or dis guise, laid before her the whole history of her misgovernment, using a severity of language, and earnestness of rebuke, more suited (to use a phrase of Throkmorton's) to a ghostly confessor than a counsellor ; her ill-advised marriage with Darnley, her hasty love, her sudden estrangement, the dark scene of his murder, the manifest guilt of Both well, his pretended trial, his unjust acquittal, her infatuated passion, her shameless marriage, her obstinate adherence to the murderer, the hatred of her subjects, her capture, her imprisonment, the 1 Throkmorton to the queen, Aug. 20, 1567.

Throughout the dismal recital, she interrupted him by extenuations, apologies, confessions, and sometimes by denials. The conversation had been prolonged till past midnight, and Mary weeping and clinging to the hope of life, again and again implored her brother's protection : but Murray was unmoved, or at least he judged it best to seem so, and retired to his chamber, bidding her seek her chief refuge in the mercy of God.' Next morning at an early hour she sent for him, and perceiving the impression he had made, he assumed a milder mood, threw in some words of consolation, and assured her that, whatever might be the conduct of others, to save her life he was ready to sacrifice his own, but unfortu nately the decision lay not with him alone, but with the lords, the church, and the people. Much also depended on herself; if she attempted an escape, intrigued to bring in the French or the English, and thus disturbed the quiet government of her son, or continued in her inordinate affection to Bothwell, 1 Ibid, ut supra."], [211, "1567 185 MARY she need not expect to live ; if she deplored her past sins, showed an abhorrence for the murder of her husband, and repented her former life with Bothwell, then might he hold out great hope that those in whose power she now lay would spare her Use. As to her liberty, he said in conclusion, that was at present out of the question. He had as yet only a single voice in the state, like other nobles, it wras therefore not in his power to procure it, nor would it be for her interest at this moment to desire it. It was Mary's weakness (in the present case we can hardly call it such) to be hurried away by impulses. She had passed the night under the dreadful conviction that her fate was decided, that she had but a short time to live. She now discerned a gleam of hope, and, starting from her seat, took Murray in her arms, and urged him to accept the regency, as the best and safest course for herself, her son, and her king dom. He declined it, she again pressed it on him, he gave his reasons against undertaking so arduous a task. She replied, and insisted, that the service of his sovereign and his country ought to outweigh every selfish motive. He at last assented; the queen then suggested that his first efforts should be directed to get all the forts into his hands, and re quested him to take her jewels, and other articles of value, into his custody, as her only way of preser ving them. On taking leave, she embraced and kissed him, with tears, and sent by him her bless ing to her son. Murray then turned to Lindsay and Lochleven, and recommending them to treat"], [212, "186 1567.

Here they remained until the evening of the 19th of August, when they returned to the capital, and on the 22nd, he was solemnly declared Regent. The ceremony of his inauguration was held in the coun cil chamber, within the Tolbooth, where in pre sence of the lords of the secret council, the nobility, spirituality, and commissioners of burghs, the in struments granted by the queen were publicly read. After this, the earl delivered an oration, in which he alluded to his own unfitness for so high an office, accepted the charge, and took the oath with his hand upon the gospels. He swore that to the ut most of his power he would serve God, according to his holy word revealed in the New and Old Testament, that he would maintain the true reli gion as it was then received within that realm, that he would govern the people according to the ancient and loveable laws of the kingdom ; procure peace, repress all wrong, maintain justice and equity, and root out from the realm all heretics and enemies to the true church of God.2 He was then proclaimed amid universal acclamations, at the Cross of Edin burgh, and throughout all the counties and burghs 1 Throkmorton to the Queen.

He obeyed, and found the regent and secretary Le thington sitting together, upon which he conveyed to them \" in as earnest and vehement a form as he could set it forth,\" the queen his mistress' severe disapproval of their recent conduct. To this remon strance, Maitland made a bold reply. He renounced for himself and his colleagues, all intention of harm to the person and honour of his royal mistress in their late proceedings. \" So far from it,\" said he, \" Mr. Ambassador, that we wish her to be queen of all the world ; but now she is in the state of a person in the delirium of a fever, who refuses every thing which may do her good, and requires all that may work her harm.

It may drive us to a strait, and compel us to measures we would gladly avoid. Hitherto have we been content to be charged with grievous and infamous titles, we have quietly suf fered ourselves to be condemned as perjured rebels and unnatural traitors, rather than proceed to any thing that might touch our sovereign's honour. But beware we beseech you, that your mistress, by her continual threats and defamations, by hostility, or by soliciting other princes to attack us, do not push us beyond endurance. Think not we will lose our lives, forfeit our lands, and be challenged as rebels throughout the world, when we have the means to justify ourselves. And if there be no remedy, but your mistress will have war, sorry though we be, far rather will we take our fortune, than put our queen to liberty in her present mood, resolved as she is to retain and defend Bothwell, to hazard the life of her son, to peril the realm, and to overthrow her nobility.\"1 \" For your wars,\" he continued, \" we know them well. You will burn our borders, and we shall burn yours ; if you invade us, we do not dread it, and are sure of France ; for your practices to nourish dissension amongst us, we have an eye upon them all. The Hamiltons will take your money, laugh you to scorn, and side with us. At this moment we have the offer of an agreement with them in 1 Throkmorton to Elizabeth, Aug. 22,\" 1567.

The queen, your mistress, declares she wishes not only for our sovereign's liberty, and her restoration to her dignity, but is equally zealous for the preservation of the king, the punishment of the murder, and the safety of the lords. To accom plish the first, our queen's liberty, much has been done, for the rest, absolutely nothing. Why does not her majesty fit out some ships of war, to appre hend Bothwell, and pay a thousand soldiers to re duce the forts and protect the king. When this is in hand, we shall think her sincere, but for her charge to set our sovereign forthwith at liberty, and restore her to her dignity, it is enough to reply to such strange language, that we are the subjects of another prince, and know not the queen's majesty for our sovereign.\"1 As soon as Lethington had concluded, Throk morton turning to Murray, expressed a hope that such sentiments would at least not meet his ap proval. He was not \" banded \" with these lords, he had committed none of their excesses. But Mur ray was now secure, he had little to fear from Eli zabeth, nothing from France, and his answer was as decided, though more laconic than the secre tary's. \" Truly, my lord ambassador,\" said he, \" methinks you have had reason at the Laird of Lethington's hands.

He had earnestly solicited his recal ; and Elizabeth now agreed to it, but ordered him first to make a last remonstrance in favour of the captive queen, and to request to be admitted to her presence. This, as he had looked for, was peremptorily refused by Murray. They had excluded De Lignerolles, the French ambassador, he said, who had so lately left them ; and it was impossible to admit him : for the rest of his message from the queen of England, the regent, after his usual fashion, replied to it with great brevity ; as to his acceptance of the govern ment the deed was done ; for calumny he cared little, and would use none other defence than a good conscience and a sincere intention ; to satisfy the queen that his mistress had consented, he could only say, that he had her own word and sig nature ; for her liberty, its being granted depended upon accidents ; and as to her condition after Both well's apprehension, it would be idle, he said, to bargain for the bear's skin before they had him. The ambassador before he took his leave, was pressed to accept a present of plate in the name of the king. This was declined in strong terms, and 1 Ibid, ut supra."], [218, "192 1567.

Murray now addressed himself with character istic decision and courage to the cares of govern ment ; and to use Throkmorton's expressive phrase, \" went stoutly to work, resolved rather to imitate those who had led the people of Israel than any captains of that age.\"1 He instantly despatched the Laird of Grange, and Murray of Tullibardin, with three armed ships in pursuit of Bothwell, who, after lurking in the north, and in vain attempting to make a party in these remote districts, had fled to Orkney and turned pirate.2 He next employed the most vigorous measures to compel the whole kingdom to acknowledge the king's government ; to secure himself against attack if Elizabeth should meditate it, and to keep up pacific relations with France, which, from the tone all along assumed by De Lignerolles, he was assured would not be difficult. The Hamiltons had made some feeble attempts to prevent the regent being proclaimed within their bounds; but they acted with no fixed plan, had no leader of ability, and gave him little anxiety.3 1 Throkmorton to Cecil, Aug. 20, 1567, in Stevenson's Selec tions, p. 282. 2 Throkmorton to Cecil, August 26, 1567, Stevenson's Selec tions, p. 294.

A large proportion of the nobles who had hitherto been hostile or neutral now sent in their adherence to his government ; and Sir James Balfour, the governor of the castle of Edinburgh, delivered that fortress into his hands. This infamous man was the intimate friend of Bothwell, and a principal actor in the king's murder. It might have been expected that Murray, who had lately expressed so much horror for that deed, and so determined a resolution to avenge it, would have been the last to overlook the crime in one of the principal conspirators ; but like other ambitious men, he could make his con science give way to his interest, as the treaty in question completely proved. Its first stipulation was, that Balfour should have an ample remission as an accomplice in the murder; the next, that before he gave up the keys of the castle, five thou sand pounds should be paid down ; the last, that he himself should have the Priory of Pittenweem, and his son an annuity. All this was agreed to, appa rently without difficulty, and only two days after Ms assuming the regency, Murray in person took possession of the castle.1 As if to cover the shame of this transaction, the regent made unusual exertions to seize some of the inferior delinquents. Previous to his arrival in Scot land, Captain Blacater had been taken and exe cuted. He now apprehended John Hay of Tallo, a page of the king's called Durham, Black John 1 MS. Letter, St. P. Off.

Spens, John Blacater, and James Edmonson.1 The guilt of Tallo, as a principal agent in the murder, was completely proved, but his examination threw Murray into great perplexity, for to use Bedford's words to Cecil, he not only \" opened the whole device of the murder,\" but declared who were the execu- tioners of the same, and went so far as to touch a great many, not of the smallest.\"2 We have already seen that Lethington, Morton, and Argile, three of the most powerful men in Scotland, were either ac- complices in the assassination, or consenting to its perpetration, and there can be no doubt that they, amongst others, were implicated in Tallo's confes sion. But in what manner was Murray to proceed ? It was these very men who had placed him in the regency, with them he now acted familiarly and confidentially, their cause could not with safety be separated from his own. He might indeed attempt to seize and punish them, but such was their strength, that it would be at the risk of being plucked down from his high office, by the same hands which had built him up. The truth, how- ever, probably was, that Murray had been long aware of the true character of the persons by whose successful guilt he now profited, and had de- termined to favour the higher culprits, whilst he let loose the vengeance of the law upon the lesser de- i MS.

He could not prevent the people, how ever, and all the more honest part of the nation from arraigning such interested conduct, but he little heeded these murmurs, and for the present Hay's examination was suppressed, and his trial indefinitely postponed. Durham, the king's page, also was kept in prison in irons.1 The regent now summoned the Castle of Dunbar, which was still held for Bothwell by one*of his re tainers. Its governor affected to resist, but Murray bombarded it in person, and in a few days the gar rison capitulated. A last effort of the Hamiltons to get up a resistance was only made to be abandoned ; Argile who had encouraged it, submitted, bringing with him Boyd, Livingston, and the Abbot of Kil winning. This last person was deputed by the Arch bishop of St. Andrew's, the leader of the Hamil tons, to make his peace; Huntly and Herries, much about the same time, gave in their adherence to the king's government, and the regent, on the 15th of September, informed his friend Cecil that the whole realm was quiet.2 In the midst of these transactions, Grange re turned unsuccessful from his pursuit of Bothwell.

In one respect the expedition was im portant, as Hepburn of Bolton, an accomplice in the king's murder, was seized in the ship, and, by his confession, threw additional light on that dark transaction. For the present, however, his reve lations were not suffered to be known.1 Murray now summoned a Parliament (Dec. 15), the proceedings of which evince the new regent's complete connexion and sympathy with the party of the Reformed Church, and demand especial atten tion.

He alluded to the vast importance of the crisis in which they met, and the subjects upon which they were about to legislate, any one of which would, he said, have been enough to have occupied a parliament. These were the establishing a uniform religion, the ac knowledgment of the just authority of the king in consequence of the queen's free demission of the crown in his favour, the sanction to be given to the appointment of a regent chosen to act in the king's minority, the reuniting the minds of the nobility, the punishment of the cruel murder of the late king, their sovereign's father, and many other dis orders requiring the grave consideration of their lordships. Upon these heads, he said, he would not dilate, but two points he must not omit, both tending to their great comfort, and calling for deep gratitude. The first was, the success which in mat ters of religion had followed such comparatively small beginnings. The second, their happy fortune in having in the regent a nobleman so excellently qualified to carry their ordinances into execution, whether they related to the church or the common wealth. \" As to religion,\" said he, \" the quietness you presently enjoy, declares sufficiently the vic tory that God by his word has obtained among you, within the space of eight or nine years ; how feeble the foundation was in the eyes of men, how unlikely it was to rise so suddenly to so large and huge a greatness, with what calmness the work has pro-"], [224, "1567. 198 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. ceeded, not one of you is ignorant.

But to return to the proceedings of the parlia ment. The committee of the Lords of the Articles having been chosen,1 the three estates sanctioned the queen's demission of the crown, the king's coro nation, and the appointment of Murray to the re gency. The Pope's authority was next abolished, the Act to that effect passed in the disputed Parlia ment of 1560, being solemnly ratified. All laws repugnant to the word of God were annulled, and the \" Confession of Faith,\" which had been already read and approved of in a former Parliament, was sanctioned and published. All heretics and hearers of mass were made liable to punishment, confisca tion of moveables being declared the penalty for the first offence, banishment for the second, and death for the third. Such persons as opposed the Confession of Faith, or refused to receive the sacra ments after the Presbyterian form, were declared to be no members of the Church of Christ.

They pleaded a former promise to this effect, and, if we may credit Bishop Spottiswood, the regent showed an anxiety to fulfil it, but the laymen, who had violently seized the property of the Church when it was in the hands of the Roman Catholic clergy, manifested the same violence now \"that their own ministers proposed to resume possession, and, with difficulty, consented to restore to them a third of the benefices.2 It was next ordered that a reforma tion should be made in all schools, colleges, and universities, and that no teachers were to be ad mitted but such as had been examined and ap proved by the appointed visitors and superintend ents, and lastly, that, as far as concerned the preaching of the word, the reformation of man- 1 Spottiswood, p. 214.

Many who were convinced of their sovereign's guilt, and who had adopted the views lately promulgated by the ministers in their pulpit addresses, contended that she should be brought to a public trial, and if the crime was proved, punished by the laws, like any other subject of the realm. To this it was objected that the monarch was the source of all authority, that she could not, without absurdity and contra diction, be made amenable to an inferior jurisdic tion, but was accountable for her conduct to God alone. It was replied, that extraordinary crimes required extraordinary remedies ; but this doctrine was not generally acceptable. The discussion con cluded in a resolution that the imprisonment of the queen should be continued, and an act of Par liament passed for the exoneration of those noble men and barons who had risen in arms for the prosecution of the murder. The terms of this act, which were nearly similar to a previous resolution of the Privy Council, require a moment's notice, as it is in it that we find the first public mention of 1 Maitland, vol. ii., p. 1007."], [228, "202 1567. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. those letters of Mary to Bothwell, which, it was afterwards contended, completely proved her guilt. It declared the conduct and transactions of these lords, from the 10th of February (the day of Darnley's murder), till the present time, to be lawful and loyal ; that they should never be sub jected to any prosecution for what they had done, because, if the queen were confined, it was solely in consequence of her own fault and demerit, seeing, that by several of her private letters, written wholly with her own hand, and sent by her to Bothwell, and by her ungodly and pretended marriage with him, it was most certain that she was cognizant, art and part, of the murder of the king her husband. This declaration of the Estates having been signed and sealed, and ordered to be printed along with the other statutes, the Parli ament was dissolved.1 It appears, by an act of Privy Council, dated the 16th September, 1568, that the Earl of Mor ton had, at that time,2 delivered to the regent the little box or coffer, with the letters and sonnets which it contained. It was to these letters that the act now quoted referred, and the partial and unjust conduct of Murray and the Parliament 1 Goodall, vol. ii. pp. 62, 69. The words in the Black Acts.

REGENCY OF MURRAY. 203 need hardly be pointed out. Such documents might or might not be originals, but by every principle of justice, the queen ought not to have been con demned, nor should these letters have been re ceived as evidence of the justice of that condem nation, until she had enjoyed in person, or by her counsel, an opportunity of examining the proofs produced against her. This injustice, however, was little in comparison with another proceeding of Mur ray's, who, having now tasted the sweets of abso lute power, and being determined, at all hazard, to retain it, became little scrupulous of the means which he employed. Sir James Balfour, as we have seen, had been the confidant of Bothwell, and was the depository of the Bond or Contract which was drawn up for the murder of the king. It had been seen by one of the accomplices in the murder, named Ormiston, who affirmed that Both well pointed out certain signatures, which he declared to be those of Argile, Huntly, Lethington, and Balfour himself.1 This profligate adherent of Bothwell's kept the bond along with the queen's jewels and other property of value in the Castle of Edinburgh, which fortress the duke had commit ted to his charge, but he betrayed the place, as we have seen, to Murray, and, on its delivery, the regent, now all-powerful, might have stipu lated for the delivery of all the evidence which threw light upon so foul a plot. In estimating his moral character, which has been highly ex- 1 Supra, p. 30."], [230, "1567. 204 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. tolled by some writers, it is instructive to mark in what w*ay he appears to have proceeded. The letters alleged to be written by the queen, were preserved, exhibited to the Council, and quoted to the Parliament as proofs of her guilt. Her jewels and other apparel were delivered up by Balfour1 to Murray, but the \" Bond\" which connected his friends with the murder, was appropriated by Leth ington, committed to the flames, and destroyed for ever. We learn this important fact, which is new in the controversy, from a letter addressed by Drury to Cecil, on the 28th of November, a short time before the meeting of the Parliament. \" The writings,\" said he, \" which did comprehend the names and consents of the chief for the murdering of the king, is turned into ashes, the same not un known to the queen, and the same that concerns her part kept to be shown, which offends her.\" It is true, there is here no assertion that the regent himself threw the bond into the fire, and it was Lethington's and Balfour's interest, as it criminated themselves, to have it destroyed ; but that Murray consented to its destruction, whilst he preserved the evidence against the queen, the whole circum stances appear to me to demonstrate. Drury, in the same letter to Cecil, observed, \" that Murray made fair weather with Mary, and was dealing 1 MS. Letter, St. P. Off. B.C. Bedford to Cecil, Berwick, 5th Sept. 1567. Ibid.

Of this partial dealing, he now gave another signal instance in the trial of those delinquents who were in custody for the king's murder. Their names were Hay of Tallo, John Hepburn of Bolton, George Dalgleish, a page or chamberlain, and William Powrie a servant of Bothwell. It was well known at the time of his being apprehended, that Hay, the confident of Bothwell, had not only given a full detail of the murder, but had accused some of the highest nobility of being accomplices in it.1 It was equally notorious, that Captain Cullen who had been employed in his most secret concerns by the chief murderer, had revealed the whole cir cumstances,2 and that the lords and the regent must have been in possession of his confession. So general was the expectation of these disclosures being made public, that Sir William Drury, in writing to Cecil upon the subject, informed him that Tallo's life had been spared for a little only, until some of the great persons who were acquainted i Bedford to Cecil.

All there fore looked with intense anxiety to the trial of these men, and it was confidently demanded, that as so much pains had been taken in the recent parlia ment to criminate the queen, the same care should be employed to discover who else were guilty, that by the publication of the confessions of Cullen, Tallo, and Hepburn, the regent would at length reveal the names of those great accomplices who had hitherto escaped. But Murray had neither the power, nor the will, to make this exposnre. The trials were shamefully hurried over. The culprits were arraigned, convicted, and executed in one day (Jan. 3). Although Hepburn of Bolton, in his speech on the scaffold, directly asserted that Argile, Huntly, and Lethington had subscribed to the bond for the murder, no arrest of these persons followed, the judicial confessions which were made by him and his accomplices were suppressed at the time, and when subsequently brought forward to be exhibited in England, it was found that they had been manifestly tampered with, and contained evi dence against no one but themselves and Bothwell.1 These proceedings told strongly against the re gent, and making every allowance for the miserable state of the law in these times, it is impossible to exculpate him from the charge of having lent him- 1 MS.

Nor does it need any great discernment to discover both the means by which the truth was suppressed, and the motive for such base conduct. Argile was Lord Justice General, the head and fountain of the cri minal jurisprudence of the country. By his deputy, the trials were conducted, and Argile was a princi pal accomplice in the king's murder. The confes sions were made before the lords of the privy coun cil, and amongst these lords were Morton, Huntly, Lethington, and Sir James Balfour, all of them parties to the murder. Lastly, Murray was regent of the realm, but he had been placed in the high office by these very men, and his tenure was still so insecure, that a new coalition might have unseated him. Such conduct, although politic so far as his own greatness was concerned, disappointed the people, and was loudly condemned. Handbills and satirical poems, which upbraided his partiality, were fixed to the doors of the privy council and of his own house. Of these one was in the following pithy terms : \u2014 Qu\u0153rilur.

Even in the parliament, his legislation on the subject of religion had been condemned by Athol, Caithness, and the Bishop of Murray, and the provision for the ministers of the church was an unpopular measure with a majority of the lords. He had endeavoured in deed, to secure the support of the chief nobility and barons by rewards and favours. Lethington had received the sheriffship of Lothian, Hume that of Lauderdale, Morton the promise of the Lord High Admiral's place, vacant by the forfeiture of Bothwell, Kirkaldy of Grange had been made governor of Edinburgh Castle, and Huntly and Argile were courted by the prospect held out to 1 MS.

Nor did it escape observation, that his conduct since his elevation had become haughty and dis tant to those proud nobles who had so recently been his equals, whilst he was open to flattery, and suffered inferior men to gain his confidence. Even the vigour with which he punished the riot and Lawlessness of the border district failed to increase his popularity, the kingdom having been so long accustomed to a more relaxed rule, that justice was construed into tyranny. Owing to such causes, it was apparent that Murray's government, soon after the dissolution of Parliament, was in a precarious state. The Hamil tons hated him ; to Lethington intrigue and change seemed to be the only elements in which he could live. Herries and the Melvils were strongly sus pected. Balfour, who knew many secrets, and was capable of any treachery, had left court in disgust. Athol was beginning to be lukewarm ;2 1 MS. Letter, St. P. Off. B. C. Berwick.

Since her interview with Murray, the captive queen had exerted all the powers of fascination which she so remarkably possessed, to gain upon her keepers. The severe temper of the regent's mother, the lady of the castle, had yielded to their influence,2 and her son George Douglas, the younger brother of Lochleven, smitten by her beauty, and flattered by her caresses, enthusiastically devoted himself to her interest. It was even asserted that he had aspired to her hand, that his mother talked of a divorce from Bothwell, and that Mary, never insen sible to admiration and solicitous to secure his ser vices, did not check his hopes.3 However this may be, Douglas for some time had bent his whole mind to the enterprise, and on one occasion, a little be fore this, had nearly succeeded; but the queen, who had assumed the dress of a laundress, was detected by the extraordinary whiteness of her i MS.

He communicated with Lord Seaton and the Hamil tons, he carried on a secret correspondence with the queen ; he secured the services of a page who waited on his mother, called Little Douglas, and by his assistance at length effected his purpose. On the evening of the 2nd of May, this youth, in pla cing a plate before the castellan, contrived to drop his napkin over the key of the gate of the castle, and carried it off unperceived : he hastened to the queen, and hurrying dow^n to the outer gate, they threw themselves into the little boat which lay there for the service of the garrison. At that mo ment Lord Seaton and some of her friends were in tently observing the castle from their concealment on a neighbouring hill ; a party waited in the vil lage below, while nearer still, a man lay watching on the brink of the lake.2 They could see a female figure with two attendants glide swiftly from the outer gate. It was Mary herself, who breathless with delight and anxiety, sprung into the boat, holding a little girl, one of her maidens, by the hand, while the page, by locking the gate behind 1 Keith, 470. - Proofs and Illustrations \u2014 No. 5, from the MSS. of Prince Labanoff, and Letter of Kirkaldy to Lochleven Morton, MSS. +- VOL.

In a moment, her white veil with its broad red fringe (the con- certed signal of success) was seen glancing in the sun, the sign was recognised and communicated, the little boat, rowed by the page and the queen herself, touched the shore, and Mary, springing out with the lightness of recovered freedom, was re- ceived first by George Douglas, and almost in- stantly aster by Lord Seaton and his friends. Throwing herself on horseback, she rode at full speed to the Ferry, crossed the firth, and galloped to Niddry, having been met on the road by Lord Claud Hamilton with fifty horse. Here she took a few hours rest, wrote a hurried despatch to France, dispatched Hepburn of Riccarton to Dun- bar, with the hope that the castle would be deli- vered to her, and commanded him to proceed afterwards to Denmark, and carry to his master, Bothwell, the news of her deliverance.1 Then again taking horse, she galloped to Hamilton, where she deemed herself in safety.

Orders were sent by them to put their vassals and follow ers in instant motion, and Mary soon saw herself at the head of six thousand men. She now assembled her council, declared to them that her demission of the government, and consent to the coronation of her son, had been extorted by the imminent fear of death, and appealed for the truth of the statement to Robert Melvil, who stood beside her and solemnly confirmed it. An act of council was then passed, declaring all the late proceedings by which Murray had become re gent treasonable and of none effect, and a bond drawn up by the nobility for the defence of their sovereign, and her restitution to her crown and kingdom, which in the enthusiasm of the moment, was signed by eight earls, nine bishops, eighteen lords, twelve abbots and priors, and nearly one hundred barons. But the queen, though encou raged by this burst of loyalty, felt a desire to avoid the misery of a civil contest, and in this spirit sent a message to Murray with offers of reconciliation and forgiveness.1 The regent wras in Glasgow, a city not eight miles from Mary's camp at Hamilton, engaged in public \u00bb Keith, p. 475.

It was a trying crisis \u2014 one of those moments in the life of a public man which test his judgment and his courage. Already the intelligence, though but a few hours old, had produced an unfavourable effett upon his party. Some openly deserted, and sought the queen's camp, others silently stole away, many wa vered, and not a few, whilst they preserved the show of fidelity, secretly made preparations for joining the enemy. Under these difficult circumstances Murray ex hibited that rapid decision and clearness of judg ment wiiich mark a great man. When coun selled to retire, he instantly rejected the advice. \" Retreat,\" said he, \" must not for a moment be contemplated.

Hume, also a skilful soldier, not only foiled Hepburn of Riccarton in his attempt to seize Dunbar for the queen,2 but kept the Merse men from declaring for her, and soon joined the re gent with six hundred men, whilst Edinburgh beat up for recruits and sent a small force of hackbut ters. The effects which so invariably follow decision and confidence were soon apparent, and in ten days Murray commanded an army of four thousand men.5 Amid these preparations Mary sent her servant, John Beaton to England and the French court, soliciting support.

Some suspected that he came to urge the expediency of a divorce from Bothwell, and a marriage between Mary and the lord of Arbroath, second son of the Duke of Chastelherault. Others affirmed, that like De Lignerolles, his secret instructions were more favourable to the regent than the queen ; but, how ever this may be, he now resorted to the camp at Hamilton, and apparently exerted himself to pro cure a reconciliation between the two factions.-2 We have already seen, that this was agreeable to Mary's own wishes. Her inclination from the first had been to avoid a battle, to retire to Dumbarton, a fortress which had been all along kept for her by Lord Fleming, and to regain by degrees her influ ence over her nobility and her people.

For this purpose Grange had previously examined the ground, and the moment he became aware that the queen's army kept the south side of the river, the regent's camp being on the opposite bank, he mounted a hackbutter behind each of his horsemen, rapidly forded the Clyde and placed them advantageously amongst some cottages, hedges, and little yards or gardens which skirted each side of a narrow lane through which the queen's troops must defile.2 Whilst this man\u0153uvre was successfully per forming, Murray, who led the main battle, and Morton, who commanded the vanguard or ad vance, crossed the river by a neighbouring bridge and drew up their men, a movement which was scarcely completed when the queen's vanguard, two thousand strong, and commanded by Lord Claud Hamilton, attempting to carry the lane, was received by a close and deadly fire from the hackbutters in the hedges and cottage gardens. This killed many, drove them back, and threw 1 Memoirs of James the Sext, p. 25.

It was composed of the flower of the border pikemen. Morton, who led it, with Hume, Ker of Cessford, and the barons of the Merse, all fought on foot, and when the first charge took place, Grange's clear voice was heard above the din of battle, calling to them to keep their pikes shouldered till the enemy had levelled theirs, and then to push on.1 They obeyed him, and a severe conflict took place. It was here only that there was hard fighting, and Sir James Melvil, who was present, describes the long pikes as so closely crossed and interlaced, that when the soldiers behind discharged their pistols and threw them or the staves of their shattered weapons in the faces of their enemies, they never reached the ground but remained lying on the spears.2 For some time the conflict was doubtful, till Grange perceiving the right wing of the regent's advance (consisting of the Renfrewshire barons) be ginning to give way, galloped to the main battle and brought Lindsay, Lochleven, Sir James Balfour, and their followers, to reinforce the weak point. This they did effectually, and their attack was so 1 Melvil's Memoirs, p. 201. MS. St. P. Off.

Murray, who had hitherto stood on the defensive, contenting himself with repulsing the enemy's cavalry, which was far superior in num bers and equipment to his own, now seized the mo ment to charge with the main battle, and the flight became universal.1 At this instant, too, the chief of the Macfarlanes and two hundred of his high landers broke in upon the scattered fragments of the army with the leaps and yells peculiar to their mode of fighting,2 and the pursuit would have been sanguinary but for the generous exertions of the regent, who called out to save the fugitives and employed his cavalry, with Grange who commanded them, not as instruments of slaughter but of mercy. Tins decisive battle lasted only three quarters of an hour. On the queen's side there were but three hundred slain \u2014 some accounts say only half that number.3 On the regent's only a single soldier fell. Ten pieces of brass cannon were taken and many prisoners of note. Amongst the rest, the Lords Seaton and Ross, the masters, or eldest sons of the Earls of Eglinton and Cassillis, the sheriffs of Ayr, the sheriff of Linlithgow, a Hamilton who bore their standard in the vanguard, the lairds of Pres- 1 Ibid.

It was reported that Argile was made prisoner, but purposely suffered to escape. On the regent's side Hume, Ochiltree, and Andrew Car of Faudonside, were severely wounded.1 Previous to the conflict Mary had taken her station upon an eminence half-a-mile distant, which commanded a view of the field. She was surrounded by a small suite, and watched the vicis situdes of the fight with breathless eagerness and hope. At last when the charge of Murray took place, witnessing the total dispersion of her army, she fled in great terror and at full speed in the direction of Dumfries, nor did she venture to draw bridle till she found herself in the abbey of Dun drennan, sixty miles from the field.2 On arriving at this place, which was on the con fines of England, the queen declared her intention of retreating into that country and throwing herself upon the protection of Elizabeth. It was a hasty and fatal resolution, adopted against the advice of those faithful servants who had followed her in her flight, and must have been dictated more by the terror of her own subjects than by any well grounded confidence in the character of Elizabeth. Lord Herries, who accompanied her, had taken 1 MS. St. P. Off.

Here she was recognized by the gentlemen of the country, who conveyed her to Cockermouth, from which Lowther conducted her with all respect and honour to Carlisle.1 Amongst her attendants were the Lords Herries, Fleming, and Livingston. While still at Workington, the queen of Scots had written to Elizabeth describing the wrongs she had endured from her rebellious subjects, alluding to the recent defeat at Langsyde, and expressing her confident hope that the queen would protect and assist her against her enemies. She concluded with these pathetic words, \" It is my earnest request that your majesty will send for me as soon as pos sible, for my condition is pitiable, not to say for a queen, but even for a simple gentlewoman. I have no other dress than that in which I escaped from the field ; my first day's ride was sixty miles across the country, and I have not since dared to travel except by night.\"2 1 MS.

On receiving this letter, Elizabeth felt that Mary was at last in her power, and she did not hesitate to avail herself of the fatal error which had been committed. Her first orders to the sheriffs on the 19th of May, sufficiently show this. She com manded them to treat the Scottish Queen and her suite with honour and respect, but to keep a strict watch, and prevent all escape.1 At the same time Lady Scrope, sister to the Duke of Norfolk, was sent to wait upon her, and Sir Francis Knollys, arrived with letters of condolence ;2 but impatient under these formalities, and anxious for a personal interview, Mary addressed a second letter to Eliza beth, in which she entreated, that as her affairs were urgent, she might be permitted instantly to see the queen, to vindicate herself from the false aspersions which had been cast upon her by her ungrateful subjects, and to dispel the doubts which she understood were entertained. She had sent up Lord Herries, she said, to communicate with her sister, and Lord Fleming to carry a message to France, but she entreated if any resolution had been formed against assisting her (a decision which must surely come from others, not from Elizabeth's own heart), leave might be given her as freely to depart from her dominions, as she had freely en tered them.

In conclusion, she reminded Elizabeth of some circumstances connected with the ring, which she now sent her. It bore the emblem of a heart, and had probably been a gist of the English Queen. \" Remember,\" said she, \" 1 have kept my promise. I have sent you my heart in the ring, and now I have brought to you both heart and body, to knit more firmly the tie that binds us together.\"1 The offer in this letter to vindicate herself in person before Elizabeth, wras earnestly pressed by Mary in her first interview with Scrope and Knollys. Her engaging manner, and the spirit and eloquence with which she defended herself, made a deep impression on both. She openly declared, that Morton and Lethington were cognizant of the king her husband's murder, and Knollys confessed, that although he began by accusing her of that dreadful crime, the sight of her tears soon transformed him into a comforter.2 Meanwhile Murray lost no time in following up the advantage which he had gained, and aster the retreat of the queen, having made an expedition northward, at the head of a large force, and for the moment put down opposition, he returned to 1 Ibid. pp. 48, 49, 50.

Notwithstanding the accusations of his enemies, no instance of cruelty or revenge can be proved against him : whether it was that his nature was really an enemy to blood, or that he found fines and forfeitures a more effectual way of destroying his opponents and enriching his friends.1 These occupations at home, however, did not prevent his cares for his safety on the side of England. As soon as he heard of Mary's retreat to Carlisle, and her offer to vindicate herself before Elizabeth, he sent up his secretary or confidential servant Wood, to express his readiness instantly to appear in per son with the Earl of Morton, to answer any charges brought against him, to produce evidence to justify his conduct and that of his companions, and as Drury expresses it, to enter himself prisoner in the Tower of London, if he did not prove * her guilty in the death of the king her husband.2 This proposal of both parties to vindicate them selves before the Queen of England, and to make her the arbiter of their mutual wrongs, came very opportunely to Elizabeth, as she was at that mo ment engaged with her council in a deliberation on the proper course to be pursued, in consequence of the flight of the Scottish Queen.

Rumours and speeches, so he wrote, were already blown about the country, ex posing in strong language, the ungratefulness of her detention, and indeed so manifest a wrong was committed by her imprisonment, it involved so fla grant a breach of the common principles of law and justice, that Knollys, an honourable nobleman, felt impatient that he should be made a \" Jailor,\" so he expressed it, in such a cause.1 Of all this, Elizabeth and her ministers were well aware ; but in that unscrupulous and accom modating school of politics for which the times wTere conspicuous, when principle and expediency were found at variance, there was seldom much hesitation which should give way, and it was resolved that, in this instance, honour and jus tice should be sacrificed to necessity. And here, although I must strongly condemn the conduct of the English Queen, it is impossible not to see the difficulties by which she was surrounded. The party which it was her interest to support, was that of Murray and the Protestants. She looked with dread on France, and the resumption of French influence in Scotland. Within her own realm, the Roman Catholics were unquiet and dis- 1 Knollys to Cecil, Carlisle, 2 June, 1568. Anderson, iv. Part i, p. 61. VOL. VI. Q"], [252, "226 1568. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. contented, and in Ireland constantly on the eve of rebellion \u2014 if such a word can be used to the resistance of a system too grinding to be tamely borne. All these impatient spirits looked to Mary as a point of union and strength. Had she been broken by her late reverses, had she manifested a sense of the imprudence by which she had been lately guided, or evinced any desire to reform her conduct, or forgive her subjects who had risen against the murderer of her husband more than against herself, the queen might have been inclined to a more favourable course. But the very con- trary was the case. Her first step after her escape had been to resume her correspondence with Both- well.1 His creatures Hepburn of Riccarton, and the two Ormistons, blotted as accomplices in his crime, had frequent access to her. In her con- versations with Knollys and Scrope, she could not repress her anticipations of victory and purposes of vengeance, if once again a free princess. She declared, that rather than have peace with Murray, she would submit to any extremity, and call help from Turkey before she gave up the contest, and she lamented bitterly that the delays of Elizabeth emboldened the traitors who had risen against her.3 Was the queen of England at such a crisis, and 1 MS.

After such conduct, could it be deemed either unlooked for, or extraordinary, should she fall from the proud position she now held, as the head of the Protestant party in Europe? So argued the far-sighted Cecil, and the queen his mistress followed, or it is probable in this instance anticipated, his counsel. It was determined to de tain Mary a prisoner, to refuse her a personal meet ing, to support Murray in the regency, and to in duce him to make public the proofs which he pos sessed of the guilt of his sovereign the Queen of Scots. With this view, Elizabeth wrote to the regent, and soon after dispatched Mr. Middlemore with a message both to him and to the Scottish Queen. She informed him in her letter, that he was accused by his sovereign of the highest crimes which a sub ject could commit against his prince, rebellion, im prisonment of her person, and her expulsion from her dominions by open battle. She admonished him to forbear from all hostility, and as her royal sister, who would observe the same abstinence, was content to commit to her the hearing and ordering of her cause, she required him to bring forward his defences against the crimes of which he was accused.1 1 Elizabeth to Murray, June 8, 1568. Anderson, vol. iv. Part i., pp. 68, 69. Q 2"], [254, "228 1568. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. Before repairing to Murray in Scotland, Mid dlemore was admitted to an interview with Mary, at Carlisle. He informed her, that his mistress disclaimed all idea of keeping her a prisoner, her present detention at Carlisle having no other ob ject than to save her from her enemies. As to a personal interview that was at present impossible. She was accused of being an accomplice in a foul and horrible crime, the murder of her husband. She had made choice of the queen of England to be the only judge of her cause, and care must be taken not to prejudice her defence, and give a handle to her enemies by admitting her to her presence, before trial had been made of her inno cency. At these words judge and trial, which escaped Middlemore, Mary's spirit rose, and she at once detected and exposed the artful diplomacy of which she was about to be made the victim. It was God, she exclaimed, who could alone be her judge, as a queen she was amenable to no human tribunal. Of her own free will, indeed, she had offered to make Elizabeth the confidant of her wrongs, to de fend herself against the falsehoods brought against her, and to utter to her such matters as had never yet been disclosed to any living being, but none could compel her to accuse herself, and as to Murray, and those rebels who had joined him, her sister was partial. She was contented, it appeared, that they should come to her presence to arraign her, whilst she, their sovereign, was debarred from"], [255, "1568. 229 REGENCY OF MURRAY. that indulgence in making her defence. Who ever heard that subjects and traitors should be permitted to plead against their prince ? And yet, said she, if they must needs come, bid the queen, my sister, call up Morton and Lethington, who are said to know most against me \u2014 confront me with them \u2014 let me hear their accusations, and then listen to my reply, \u2014 But, she added significantly, \u2014 I suspect that Lethington would be loath of such an errand.1 It had been Mary's idea from some expressions used by Scrope and Knollys in their first interview,2 that the English Queen would be induced to re store her without enquiry, or at least by an enquiry so regulated as to criminate her subjects without permitting them to reply ; but the mission of Mid dlemore dispelled this notion. She found that not only was she to be refused an interview with the English Queen, but that Murray had been already called upon to repair to England, and to justify his conduct by bringing forward his proofs against his sovereign. Against this she loudly protested, and at once declared, that she would endure impri sonment, and even death, sooner than submit to such indignity.3 Such conduct was, no doubt, com pletely consonant to her feelings and her rights as 1 Anderson, vol. iv., Part i., p. 90.

Murray in the mean time acted with his accus tomed calmness and decision. Having received Mid dlemore's message at Dumfries, hostilities against Mary's partisans were suspended at the request of the English Queen, and he professed his readiness to repair to England in person, accompanied by Morton, rather than that the truth should not be fully investigated;1 but previous to this, there was one point upon which he desired to be satisfied. It was evident, he said, that in a cause involving such grave results, nothing could be more ruinous for him than to accuse the queen, the mother of his sovereign, and afterwards, as he expressed it, \" to enter into qualification with her.\" 2 Again, if the ac cusation should proceed, and he was able to prove his allegations, he was solicitous to know what was likely to follow. As to such letters of the queen of Scots as were in his possession, he had already sent translations of them by his servant, Wood, and he would gladly understand whether in the event of the originals agreeing with these translations, their \u00bb MS.

Cecil's answer was framed with the evident view of being com municated by Lord Herries, who was then at the English court, to his sovereign. It informed the regent that Elizabeth neither meant to promote any accusation of the Scottish Queen, nor to pro ceed to any condemnation, that her single purpose was to settle all disputes, to allow of no faults in her sister, to bring the controversy to a happy con clusion with surety to all parties, and to esteem no proofs sufficient till both parties were heard.2 Such *a declaration must have startled Mur ray, and had he believed it, it is evident from the cautious tone of his previous enquiries that no accusation of the queen of Scots was to be looked for from him.

It was her object to persuade the regent, that whatever might be her assurances to Mary, she really intended to try the cause, and if he could prove her guilty, to keep her, where she was, in prison ; it was her purpose on the other hand, to convince Mary that she would never permit Murray to bring forward any accusation, but quashing all odious criminations, promote a reconciliation with her subjects, and restore her to her dignity. The negotiations were conducted on the part of the Scottish Queen by Lord Herries, who was then at the English court, and by Cecil's directions, such only of this noble man's proposals as it was deemed expedient Mur ray should know were communicated to the regent,1 whilst from Mary we may believe the same con cealment was made of Murray's entire messages. These artful transactions occupied nearly a month, and were interrupted, not only by the suspicions and delays of both parties, but by the state of Scotland. In that country Murray's unpo pularity was now excessive, whilst the queen's friends were daily rising into confidence and strength. The severity of the regent, and the ter rors of an approaching parliament, in which the dismal scenes of forfeiture and confiscation were expected to be renewed, had so estranged his sup porters and united his enemies, that he began to be alarmed not only for his government, but for his i MS.

A conspiracy for his assassination was dis covered, at the head of which were the comptroller Murray of Tullibardin and his brother, the same persons who had acted so bold a part in arraigning Bothwell.1 The regent was taunted, and not un justly, with his former activity in prosecuting the king's murder, and his present lukewarmness ; and people pointed ironically to his associate, Sir James Balfour, a man universally detested, by his own confession one of the murderers, and now em ployed by Murray in the most confidential affairs of the government.2 To such a height had these discontents arisen, that Argile, Huntly, and the Hamiltons, uniting their strength in favour of the queen, held a convention at Largs (July 28) in which they resolved to let loose the borderers upon England, and wrote to the Duke of Alva requesting his assistance in the most earnest terms.3 Notwithstanding the delays produced by this miserable state of things, Mary and the regent at last agreed to have their disputes settled by the English Queen, and Lord Herries having arrived at Bolton Castle, to which place the Scottish Queen had been removed, informed his mistress, in the presence of Scrope 1 MS.

As some controversy has arisen upon this point, it is right to give his very words. He told Mary, that Elizabeth had com manded him to say unto her, \" that if she would commit her cause to be heard by her highness order, but not to make her highness judge over her, but rather as to her dear cousin and friend to commit herself to her advice and counsel, that if she would thus do, her highness would surely set her again in her seat of regiment, and dignity regal, in this form and order. First, her highness would send for the noblemen of Scotland, that be her adversaries, to ask account of them, before such noblemen as this queen herself should like of, to know their answer, why they have deposed their queen and sovereign from her regiment, and that if in their answers they could allege some reason for them in their so doing, (which her highness thinks they cannot do) that her highness would set this queen in her seat regal conditionally, that those her lords and subjects should continue in their honours, estates, and dignities to them appertain ing. But if they should not be able to allege any reason of their doings, that then her highness would absolutely set her in her seat regal, and that by force of hostility, if they should resist.\" To this promise, which is quite clear and explicit, Elizabeth annexed as conditions, that Mary should renounce all claim to the crown of England, during the life of the queen, or her issue, that she"], [261, "1568. REGENCY OF MURRAY. 235 should forsake the league with France, and aban doning the mass, receive the Common Prayer after the form of England.1 This last stipulation was added with a view of encouraging some symptoms of a dis position to be converted to the Church of England, which had recently appeared in Mary \u2014 who had re ceived an English chaplain, and \" had grown to a good liking of the Common Prayer.\"2 These proposals the queen of Scots embraced after some hesitation, and commissioners would have been immediately appointed for the trial of this great cause, but for the melancholy state of Scotland. In this country Huntly and Argile kept the field at the head of a large force, and having completely reduced under the queen's power the northern and western parts of the kingdom, were rapidly advancing to the south. Their object was, to crush Murray before he could hold the parlia ment in which they expected the vengeance of the laws to be let loose against themselves, but their march was arrested by letters from their sovereign, who commanded her friends to desist from hosti lities, informing them, that Elizabeth would com pel the regent to the same course.3 This order, on Mary's side, was obeyed; on Murray's, if indeed ever sent by the English Queen, it was openly violated ; for scarce were his rivals dispersed, than the par liament met, (18 August) and had it not been for 1 Anderson, vol. iv.

As it was, all his efforts could not save the Archbishop of St. Andrew's, Lord Claud Hamilton, the Bishop of Ross, and many others, who were declared traitors, and for feited.1 It was in vain that the lords of Mary's party complained of this cruel and unjust conduct, and prepared for revenge. Murray forgetful of his promises, anticipated their attack, hastily levied a force, overran Annandale and Galloway, and would have reduced all opposition by fire and sword, had not his progress been interrupted by a peremp tory message from Elizabeth, who commanded him instantly to lay dow*n his arms, and send commis sioners to York to answer for his conduct to his sovereign. If this was delayed or resisted, she declared her resolution instantly to set Mary at liberty, and assist her against her enemies, adding, that his refusal would convince her of his mistress's innocence and his own guilt.2 This mandate Murray did not dare to disobey, whatever may have been his wishes and regrets. He distrusted Elizabeth, he dreaded increasing his unpopularity with the nobles, by openly bringing forward so odious an accusation against his sove reign; he saw that success was doubtful, failure absolute ruin, and when he proposed to select commissioners, all shrunk from so invidious an 1 Anderson, vol. iv.

But he had advanced too far to retract, and digesting, as he best could, the mortification of being arrested in the course of his victories, he determined to appear personally at York, and ap pointed four commissioners to accompany him. These were the Earl of Morton, the Bishop of Orkney, Lord Lindsay, and the Commendator of Dumfermling. To them he added some assistants, the most noted of whom were Lethington, the secretary, whom he had begun to suspect of a leaning to the queen's cause, and dreaded to leave behind him, the celebrated Buchanan and Mr. James Makgill. Elizabeth now directed the Duke of Norfolk, the Earl of Sussex, and Sir Ralph Saddler, to appear upon her part, and nothing remained but for Mary to appoint her commis sioners.1 Previous to this, she desired to have a consulta tion with Lesly the Bishop of Ross, and, on his repair to Bolton, this able and attached servant expressed his sorrow that she had agreed to any conference wherein her subjects should be accused, as Murray and his friends, he said, would un doubtedly utter all they could for their defence, although it were to her dishonour, and that of the whole realm ; it was vain, he added, to expect that they would openly acknowledge themselves to be ill subjects, and she a good princess, and it would, in his opinion, be far better to endeavour 1 Goodall, vol. ii. p. 109."], [264, "238 1568. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. to bring about an amicable arrangement without any accusation on either side. To this, Mary's answer, as reported by Lesly himself, was remark able. She declared that there was no such danger to be apprehended as he supposed, since the judges would be favourable to her, and she was already assured of the good will of the Duke of Norfolk, who had sent her a message to Bolton, expressive of his attachment to her interests.1 At this moment Robert Melvil arrived at Bolton with important dispatches from Lethington to Mary. He stated that Murray was determined to utter every thing he could against her, and had carried with him to York the \" letters winch he had to produce in proof of the murder ; he sent her, by the same messenger, copies of these letters which he had clandestinely procured ; he assured her, that no thing but a desire to do her service had induced him to come into England, and begged her to send word by Melvil to York, what she thought it best for him to do. Mary, after having carefully examined these letters, which were only the trans lations from the original French into the Scottish language, sent her answer to Lethington. It is worthy of note, that it contained no assertion as to the forgery or interpolation of these letters, now, as it appears, communicated to her for the first time. It simply requested him to use his efforts to stay the rigorous accusations of Murray, 1 Examination of the Bishop of Ross at the Tower.

They were the Bishop of Ross, Lords Herries, Boyd, and Livingston, the Abbot of Kilwinning, Sir John Gordon of Lochinvar, and Sir James Cock burn of Skirling.2 These persons having re ceived their instructions, proceeded to York, where they met the regent, the Duke of Norfolk, and the rest of the judges. So far Elizabeth had been successful, and the position in which she had placed herself was certainly most solemn and imposing. Before her pleaded the Queen of Scots, so late her rival and her opponent, now her prisoner awaiting her award, and acknowledging, that if restored to her dignity, she would owe all to her interference. On the other hand, stood the Regent, the representative of the majesty of his sovereign, and the governor of a kingdom, but now receiving the law from her lips whose superior power he did not dare to resist. To hear the cause were assembled the noblest and the wisest in both countries ; and besides this, the misfortunes of Mary had created so great and universal a sensation that it is no exaggeration when we say, the eyes not only of England and Scotland, but of Europe, were fixed upon the con ferences now opening at York. 1 Murdin, pp. 52, 53. 2 Goodall, vol. ii. p. 109.31 Sep. 1568."], [266, "240 1568.

The commissioners accordingly having assem bled, the proceedings began, but, on the very threshold, a sharp dispute arose, when Norfolk observed that the regent, having consented to plead before Elizabeth, must first do homage to the Eng lish crown. The proposition was received as an insult, and Murray, red with anger, was hesitating how to answer it, when the cooler Lethington took up the word, and sarcastically remarked, that when the Scottish monarchs received back again the coun ties of Northumberland and Cumberland, with the manor of Huntingdon, it would be time to talk of homage ; but, as to the crown and kingdom of Scotland, both were more free than their own England had recently been when she paid Peter's pence to Rome.1 The mention of the point, how ever, rendered some notice of it necessary, and after the oaths had been administered, mutual pro testations were taken.2 The commissioners of the Scottish Queen then gave in their complaint. It stated, in clear and energetic language, the history of the Rebellion against Mary, her deposition and imprisonment, the usurpation of the regency by Murray, her escape, defeat, and flight into Eng land, and her confident hope, that by the mediation of Elizabeth, she might be restored to the peacea ble enjoyment of her kingdom.1 1 Melvil's Memoirs, p. 206.

All now looked with eagerness for Murray's reply, confidently expecting that he would bring forward, as his defence, the accusation of his sovereign, and the promised proofs of her ac- cession to the murder of the king ; but, to the surprise and disappointment of Elizabeth, he was seized with a repetition of his former fears, and, instead of proceeding to any accusation re- quested a preliminary conference with the Eng- lish commissioners. Being admitted to it, he de- sired to know whether they would grant him an assurance that their mistress would pronounce the queen of Scots guilty or not guilty, according to the proofs which he laid before them, and in the event of the conviction of the murder, whether the queen of England would sanction his proceedings, maintain the government of the king, and support him in his office of regent.2 These questions being remitted by the commissioners to Elizabeth, he gave in his defence, which produced new astonish- ment. It rested solely on Mary's marriage with Bothwell, and detailed the shameful circumstances by which it w*as accompanied, with the necessity of rising in arms to defend the prince, and of sub jecting the queen to a temporary imprisonment, during which she voluntarily resigned the crown. It added not a syllable, directly or indirectly, ac- cusing Mary of being an accomplice in the murder, J Goodall, vol. ii. pp. 123, 126. 2 Goodall, vol. ii. p. 130, 131. Oct. 9th, 126, 127. VOL. VI.

HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. and did not even contain a hint or an allusion, from which it could be gathered that the regent ever entertained such a suspicion (Oct. 10).1 It was difficult to account for this sudden and un expected moderation upon the part of Murray. A few weeks only had elapsed since he had been loud in his accusations, and testified the utmost eager ness to bring forward his proofs. He was now silent on the subject \u2014 his defence was general, al most to feebleness, and when, after a few days' interval, it was replied to by Mary's commissioners, who urged, forcibly and triumphantly, the coalition between Bothwell and the lords, his trial and acquittal, and their subsequent recommendation of him as a husband to the queen, he sat down apparently dispirited and confuted, and declined saying another word upon the subject. A secret intrigue, of which we have already had some slight intimation from Mary's conversa tion with the Bishop of Ross, furnishes us with a key to all this mystery. It originated in the am bition of the Duke of Norfolk, a nobleman then perhaps the most powerful subject in England, and who had long been a favourer of Mary's title to the crown. There seems, too, to be little doubt that for some time Norfolk had entertained the idea of a marriage with the Scottish Queen, and that he deprecated the present proceedings 1 Goodall, vol. ii. p. 144 and 139 ; and Depeches de la Motte Fenelon, published by Mr. P. Cooper, vol. i. pp. 17, 1 8, a very valuable work."], [269, "1568. REGENCY OF MURRAY. 243 against her in the strongest manner, although he dared not refuse the task imposed upon him by Elizabeth. These feelings, which he had secretly imparted to the Scottish Queen through his sister Lady Scrope, who waited on her, she had, as w*e have seen, communicated to Lethington and the Bishop of Ross ; and Lethington on his arrival at York procured a secret interview with Norfolk.1 On this occasion the Duke expressed his astonish ment that he and Murray should so far forget their honour as to accuse their sovereign before Elizabeth \u2014 as if they thought that England was entitled to be a judge or a superior over the kingdom of Scotland. Lethington warmly deprecated the idea, blamed the weakness of the regent, whose own feelings were against the accusation, declared for his own part that he was there, as Murray well knew, rather as the friend than the enemy of his sovereign, and pro fessed his readiness to exert every effort to quash the accusation.2 Norfolk then asked, whether he thought in this matter Murray could be trusted, and the secretary affirming that he might, the Duke took the regent aside and remonstrated with him on the folly and impolicy of his present conduct. \" The English Queen, his mistress,\" he said, \" was resolved during her life to evade the question of the succession ; careless what blood might be shed, or what confusion might arise upon the point \u2014 as to the true title, none doubted that it lay in the queen ' Examination of the Bishop of Ross.

We are sent here, no doubt, as commissioners, but we are debarred from coming to a decision, and Elizabeth has fully resolved to arrive at none herself. Do you not see that no answers have been returned to the questions which upon this point were addressed by you to us, and forwarded to the queen ? Nay, you can easily put the matter to a more certain proof. Request an assurance under the queen's hand, that when you accuse your sovereign and bring forward your proofs, she will pronounce sentence. If you get it, act as you please\u2014 if it is not given, rest as sured my information is correct, and all that will come of your accusation will be repentance for your own folly.\"2 This conversation made a deep impression on Mur ray, already sufficiently alive to the dangerous part he was playing ; and when he imparted it in confi dence to Lethington and Sir James Melvil both of 1 Melvil's Memoirs, pp. 206, 207. 2 Melvil's Memoirs, p. p. 207, 208, 4to. Edit. Melvil's autho rity here is unquestionable, as he was not only present at York, but the regent made him privy to this secret interview. Also Depeches de la Motte Fenelon, vol. i., p, 17,"], [271, "1568. REGENCY OF MURRAY. 245 them strongly confirmed him in the views stated by Norfolk.1 From his brother commissioners, Morton and Makgill, and his secretary Wood, who had drawn up the proofs against the Scottish Queen, the regent carefully concealed what had happened, but he determined to follow Norfolk's advice, and bring forward no public accusation till he was as sured of the course to be followed by Elizabeth. Such is the secret history of Murray's sudden change, and the present moderation of his conduct towards the queen his sovereign. But whilst a regard for his own interest prevented him from assuming the character of a public ac cuser, the regent privately exhibited to Norfolk, Sussex, and Sadler the alleged proofs of Mary's guilt, consisting of various bonds or contracts and other papers, besides some letters and love sonnets addressed by her to Bothwell, with a contract of marriage in the handwriting of the Earl of Huntly. These letters had been found, as the Scottish com missioners affirmed, in a little silver casket or coffer ; it had been given by the queen to Bothwell, and was afterwards with its contents seized by Morton, and they offered to swear that the letters were written in Mary's own hand. Having carefully inspected them, and drawn up a summary of their contents, Norfolk transmitted it in a letter to Elizabeth, re questing her judgment whether she considered them sufficient to convict the queen of the murder of her husband. He added, at the same time, his own i Melvil's Memoirs, 208."], [272, "246 1568. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. opinion and that of his brother commissioners, that the proof was conclusive against her, if the letters were really written with her own hand.1 This, however, was confidential, and unknown to the world, so that if matters had terminated here the result of the enquiry must have been considered highly favourable to Mary. She had triumphantly confuted Murray, and, after his boastful speeches, he had shrunk from any open accusation. But Elizabeth was not to be so easily defeated. She had resolved that Murray should publicly accuse his sovereign of the murder, she was convinced that such an event would be of the greatest service to England whether the Scottish Queen was to be restored to her dignity or detained a prisoner ; and with this view she suddenly removed the confer ences to Westminster, affirming that York was too distant to allow of a speedy settlement of the con troversy, and taking particular care that neither Mary nor her commissioners should suspect any sinister intention upon her part.2 How artfully this was managed appears by the original draft of the English Queen's letter, still preserved, and partly in Cecil's handwriting. In it Norfolk and his companions were instructed to be especially careful that the queen of Scots' commissioners should gather no suspicion of the ill success of her cause, but imagine that this new measure was solely intended to accelerate their mistress's re- 1 The Commissioners to Elizabeth, 11 October, 1568.

He had sent Robert Melvil to Bolton, to propose a scheme, by which all necessity for ac cusing his sovereign should be removed, and an amicable compromise take place. The Scottish Queen was to ratify her demission of the crown, which had been made in Lochleven, the regent was to be confirmed in his government, and Mary was to tarry in England, under the protection of Eliza beth, and with a revenue suitable to her royal dig nity. On these conditions Murray was contented to be silent ; and although at first the captive princess professed much unwillingness to agree to such terms, she was at length convinced by the arguments of Melvil, that such a settlement of the controversy was the best for her interest and honour. She therefore dispatched Melvil to carry her con sent to Murray ; 2 she wrote to the English Queen, expressing her entire satisfaction that her cause and her honour were now placed in her hands, where she most wished them to be,3 and she dis- 1 Orig. draft.

HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. patched four of her commissioners, Boyd, Herries, the Bishop of Ross, and the Abbot of Kilwinning*, to London. On their arrival Elizabeth admitted them to an audience, assured them that she had carefully weighed all that had been done at York, that the enemies of the queen of Scots appeared to her to have entirely failed in their defence, as far as they had yet pleaded, and that their only course was to acknowledge their offences, return to their allegi ance, and intercede for pardon, which she would la bour to procure them. For this purpose she had re moved the conferences to London, and to make the settlement more solemn had joined some other com missioners to those already named. Nothing now remained but to proceed with the business, first ascertaining whether Murray had any fhing fur ther to say in his defence.1 When the regent repaired along with Lethington and Makgill to London, it was with a determination not to accuse Mary, but to remain true to his agree ment to Norfolk, and if any thing should occur to render its execution difficult or impossible, to fall back upon his scheme for Mary's demission of the crown, which he had so lately proposed, and to which she had consented. But an interview with Elizabeth alarmed and perplexed him ; he found, to his dismay, that she was perfectly aware of his intrigues with Norfolk. The whole transactions 1 Anderson, vol. iv.

REGENCY OF MURRAY. 249 had been betrayed by a confidant of Mary to Mor ton ; he had indignantly revealed it to Cecil, and from him it reached the queen. Nor were his diffi culties lessened by a message from Mary herself, who informed him that the Duke of Norfolk had forbid her to resign the crown ; and without his consent she could not abide by her agreement.1 Nothing could be more embarrassing than his situa tion. On the one hand Elizabeth did not conceal her anxiety, that he should accuse the Scottish Queen and bring forward his proofs of the murder. She had every thing in her power ; she already hinted, that in case of his refusal it might be found necessary to bring forward the Duke of Chastelhe rault, whose claim to the regency was superior to his own ; and it is scarcely matter of wonder that Murray faltered in his resolution. Yet, should he consent to the wishes of the queen of England, he must bear the disgrace of betraying Norfolk. On the other hand, if he remained true to this noble man, his fellow commissioners were ready to arraign him of treachery to them and to the cause of his sovereign. Under these embarrassments he adopted a middle course, and resolved to prepare the accu sation, but not to make it public until he had a positive assurance that the queen of England would pronounce judgment. Meanwhile Mary became alarmed at, some pri vate intelligence which she received from Hepburn Melvil's Declaration. Hopetoun, MS."], [276, "250 1568. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. of Riccarton, a follower of Bothwell's, who was now in London, and who assured her that so far from being favourable, Elizabeth was decidedly hostile to her, and would probably succeed in com pelling Murray to desert Norfolk and accuse his sovereign.1 To meet such an emergency she sent additional instructions to her commissioners, by which their powers were limited to the single act of extending her clemency to her disobedient sub jects. She added, that if they found any encou ragement given to her adversaries to accuse her, they were instantly to demand her personal admis sion to the presence of Elizabeth, and if this was refused to break up the negotiation.2 The conferences were now opened in the cham ber, called the Camera depicta at Westminster, the commissioners of the Scottish Queen having de clined to meet in any place where a judicial sen tence had been pronounced. They protested against any thing which was now done being interpreted against the rights of their mistress, who, as a free princess, acknowledged no judge or superior on earth; and they required, that as Murray had been admitted to the presence of Elizabeth, and had calumniated his sovereign, the English Queen should grant the same privilege to the queen of Scots, and listen to her defence from her own lips. To this Elizabeth replied, that it was far from her intention to assume the character of a judge, or in 1 MS. Letter, St. P. Off. Knollys to Cecil, 21 November, 1568. 2 Goodall, vol. ii. pp. 185, 186, 187."], [277, "1568. 251 REGENCY OF MURRAY. any thing to touch their sovereign's honour ; but, that to admit her into her presence was impossible till the cause was decided.1 With tlris answer they were compelled to be content ; and having retired, Murray and his friends were called in, when being informed that the de fences recently made by them at York, were con sidered inconclusive, they were required to say whether they could urge any thing further in their behalf. To encourage them to speak openly Sir Nicholas Bacon, the lord keeper, assured the re gent in reply to the demands made at York, that if the queen of Scots should be proved guilty of the murder of her husband, she should either be delivered into his hands, her life being sufficiently secured, or be kept in England ; and he added, that if found guilty, Murray should be continued in the regency, till it was shown that another had a su perior right.2 By this declaration Murray was somewhat re assured. He had prepared his accusation, and the paper which contained it was at that moment in the possession of John Wood, his secretary, who sat beside him at the table, and for greater security kept it in his bosom. The regent now rose and de clared how unwilling he and his friends had ever been to touch the honour of their sovereign, or to publish to strangers what might eternally defame her ; how readily, had it been possible, they would 1 Goodall, vol. ii. p. 188, 189, November 23, 1568. 2 Ibid. vol. ii. p. 201, 202, November 26, 1568."], [278, "252 1568. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. have secured her reputation and preserved their prince, even at the price of their own exile ; and he solemnly protested, that if at last they were compelled to pursue a different course, the blame was not to be imputed to them but rested with their enemies, who constrained them to adopt it in their own defence, and dragged into light the proofs which they had hitherto concealed.1 Having deli vered this protest in writing, Murray prepared to give in his accusation, but before he took this last and fatal step, he required an assurance under the English Queen's hand, that she would pro nounce a judgment. To this Cecil replied, that he had ample assurance already; and it ill became him to suspect or doubt the word of their royal mistress. Where, added he, is your accusation. It is here, said Wood, plucking it from his bo som, and here it must remain till we see the queen's handwrit ; but as he spoke the paper was snatched from him by Bothwell, the Bishop of Ork ney, who sprung to the table pursued by Wood, and mid the ill-suppressed laughter of the English commissioners laid it before them. The scene, as it is .described by Melvil, must have been an ex traordinary one. The regent was deeply mortified, and Cecil, smiling triumphantly, enjoyed his con fusion ; Lord William Howard, a rough seaman, shouted aloud, and commended the activity of Bishop Turpy, a nickname of Orkney ; and Leth- 1 Anderson, vol. iv. Part ii. pp. 115, 11 8."], [279, "1568. REGENCY OF MURRAY. 253 ington, who was the saddest of the company, whispered in Murray's ear, that he had ruined his cause for ever.1 The die, however, was cast, and the charge which had been so long withheld, was now preferred in the broadest terms. The regent stated, that as Both well w*as the chief executor of the horrible murder of their late sovereign, so he and his friends affirmed that the queen his wife had persuaded him to commit it, that she was not only in the foreknowledge of the same, but a maintainer of the assassins, as she had shown by thwarting the course of justice, and by marrying the chief au thor of that foul crime.2 To give additional force and solemnity to this proceeding, the Earl of Len nox, father to the murdered king, at this moment presented himself before the commissioners, and having bewailed in pathetic terms the miserable fate of his son, delivered to them a paper in which he accused Mary in direct terms of conspiring his death.8 When informed of this proceeding, the deputies of this princess expressed the utmost indignation ; -they declared that nothing could be more false arid calumnious than such a statement, that some of those persons, who, now with shameless ingratitude, sought to blacken their sovereign, were themselves deeply implicated in the murder, and they required 1 Melvil's Memoirs, pp. 210, 211. 2 Anderson, vol. iv. P. ii. p. 1 19. 3 Ibid. p. 122."], [280, "1568. 254 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. an immediate audience of Elizabeth.1 When ad mitted to her presence, they complained in strong terms of the manner in which she had conducted the proceedings ; they reminded her, how carefully it had been provided, that in the absence of their royal mistress, nothing should be done which might affect her honour and royal estate ; this they de clared had been directly infringed; she had ad mitted her subjects into her presence ; they had been encouraged to load her with the most atro cious imputations ; it was now, therefore, their duty, as custodiars of their mistress's honour, to de mand, that in common justice she should also be heard in person ; and to beseech her to arrest the authors of such slanderous practices, till they should answer the charges which should be brought against them.2 This demand perplexed Elizabeth. It was a just and spirited assertion on the part of the Scottish commissioners of their mistress's undoubted right ; but the English Queen had not the slightest in tention of acquiescing in it. She had now gained her first point, Murray having at last publicly ar raigned Mary of the murder ; but another and greater object remained : she was desirous of get ting possession of the proofs of her guilt, of exhi biting them to her council; and either publishing them to the world, or employing them in intimi dating her unhappy prisoner into an acceptance of 1 Goodall, Appendix, vol. ii. pp. 209-213, inclusive. 2 Goodall, Ibid. pp. 213-219. LaMotte Fenelon, vol. i. pp. 38-51."], [281, "1568. 255 REGENCY OF MURRAY. any terms she dictated. Her mode of accomplish ing this was artful and politic. It was no doubt quite reasonable, she said, addressing the commis sioners of the queen, that their mistress should appear to defend herself against so heinous an im putation as the murder of her husband, a crime of which she never had believed her guilty. As for a personal interview, the only reason why she had refused this was, on account of the common slander against her ; and now, since the accusa tion had been publicly made, it would be incon sistent alike with her honour and that of their mi stress, to consent to any compromise or agreement, until the regent and Ms friends had been called upon to prove their allegations. She therefore had resolved to send for them and demand their proofs, after which she would willingly hear their mistress.1 The commissioners remonstrated against the manifest partiality and injustice of such a pro ceeding; they observed, that her majesty must of course act as she pleased ; but, for their part, they would never consent that their sovereign's re bellious subjects should be further heard, till she herself were admitted to declare her innocence ; and they ended, by solemnly protesting that nothing done hereafter should in any way affect or prejudge her rights.2 So far every thing on their part was consistent and agreeable to the indignant feelings of a person unjustly accused ; but their next step 1 Goodall, vol. ii. p. 221, December 4. 2 Goodall, vol. ii. p. 223."], [282, "256 1568. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. is perplexing, and seems not so easily reconcileable with Mary's perfect innocence, for on the same day, they made a final proposal for a compromise, by which Murray, notwithstanding his accusation, might still once more be admitted to the favour of his sovereign, and the disputes between her and her subjects be settled.1 They added that this scheme seemed to them most consonant to the first intentions of both the queens. It was rejected, however, by Elizabeth \u2014 any compromise she said would now affect Mary's honour ; better far would it be to summon her accusers, to reprimand and chastise them, for the defamation of their sove reign. She would not call for proofs ; but if they persisted in their charge it would be proper to hear what they could allege in their defence.2 Such a proposal for a compromise would certainly tell strongly against the innocence of the Scottish Queen, had it proceeded from herself, after the accu sation brought forward by Murray, but this was not the case. It came from her commissioners alone, and, as they afterwards asserted, without any communi cation with their mistress. When at last, they found it declined, and perceived that Elizabeth had formed a resolution to hear from Murray the alleged proofs of their sovereign's guilt, before she was suffered to open her lips in her defence, they resolved to be equally peremptory : As soon there- 1 See Anderson, vol. iv. P. ii. pp. 135, 137, for the particulars of this last proposal. 2 Id. Ibid. pp. 139, 140."], [283, "1568. REGENCY OF MURRAY. 257 fore as the regent was summoned before the Eng lish commissioners, the Bishop of Ross, and his associates, demanded admission, and coming for ward, at once dissolved the conference. They declared that since the queen of England was de termined to receive from the regent the proofs of his injurious allegations against their sovereign, before she was heard in her presence, they were compelled to break off all proceedings, and they delivered a written protest, that nothing done here after should prejudice the honour or estate of their royal mistress. Cecil and the commissioners de clined to receive this paper, affirming, that it misrepresented the answer of the English Queen, but the Scottish deputies withdrew, repeating that they wrould neither treat nor appear again.1 From this moment the conferences were truly at an end, but Elizabeth's object was still to be at tained \u2014 Murray therefore was charged with having defamed his sovereign by an unfounded accusation, and required to defend himself. He did so by the production of those celebrated letters and sonnets which Elizabeth had already secretly examined, and of which he now produced both the originals and the copies. Of these the originals have long since disap peared, and the garbled state of the copies which now exist, and which appear to have been tampered with, certainly, renders their evidence of a suspi cious nature. At this time, however, both originals 1 Anderson, vol. iv. Part ii. pp. 145, 146. Dec. 6, 1568. VOL. VI. S"], [284, "1568. 258 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. and copies were laid before the commissioners, after which the depositions of some servants of the late king, and the confessions of Powrie and others, ex ecuted for the murder, were produced. Having proceeded thus far, and the English commissioners being in possession of the whole proofs against the Scottish Queen, it might have been expected that some opinion would have been pronounced by them. Nothing of the kind, how ever, took place, neither did Elizabeth herself think it then expedient to say a word upon the subject, but after a short season of delay, she resolved to bring the cause before a more numerous tribunal. With this view the chief of her nobility were sum moned to attend a meeting of the Privy Council. There came accordingly the Earls of Northumber land, Westmoreland, Shrewsbury, Worcester, War wick, and Huntingdon, and from some expressions dropt by Cecil, in a letter to Norris,1 it may be gathered, that it was intended with their ad vice to come at last to some important and final decision. Yet this third solemn preparation ended like the rest, in nothing. After the lords had been sw*orn to secrecy, the whole evi dence against the queen of Scots was laid be fore them, and instead of a judgment upon the authenticity of the proofs, and the alleged guilt of the accused, these noble persons contented them selves with a vague allusion to the \" foul matters they had seen,\" and a general approval of the course 1 Cabala, p. 155."], [285, "1568. 259 REGENCY OF MURRAY. adopted by their sovereign. Elizabeth next sent for the Scottish commissioners, and in reply to their demand so recently made for the admission of their royal mistress to defend herself in her presence informed them that, from the turn matters had taken, it had become now more impossible than ever to listen to such a request. It was easy, she said, for Mary either to send some confidential person to court with her defence, or to permit the English Queen to dispatch some noblemen to receive it, or to authorize her deputies to reply to the English commissioners. If she still refused to adopt any one of these methods to vindicate herself, she must not be surprised if so obstinate a silence should be interpreted into an admission of guilt.1 These specious offers and arguments did not impose upon the Bishop of Ross and his colleagues. They remonstrated loudly against the injustice with which their royal mistress had been treated, they insisted that since she was denied the common pri vilege of a personal defence, she should be per mitted to return as a free princess to her own kingdom, or if she preferred it, to retire to France, and at the same time, as their services were no longer necessary, they requested their dismissal from court.2 The queen replied, they might go to Bolton and consult with their mistress, but should not leave England till the conference was at an end. She then addressed to Mary a letter, of which the \u00ab Goodall, vol. ii. pp. 257, 260, 263, 264. 2 Goodall, vol. ii. p. 267, 268. s 2"], [286, "260 1568. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. object seemed to be, to intimidate her into a de fence ; but so perplexed and capricious was Eliza beth's mind at this moment, that on the next day she changed her measures, and in a private communi cation to Knollys, the vice chamberlain, who then had charge of the Scottish Queen, declared her anxiety to proceed no farther in her cause. It ap peared to her, she said, a far better method to endeavour to persuade Mary to resign the govern ment into the hands of Murray, whilst the prince her son, for his safety, should be brought into England. She herself, too, it was added, might continue in that country, and this whole cause of hers, wherewith she had been charged, be com mitted to perpetual silence.1 Knollys was directed to manage matters so that this proposal might proceed from herself: but whilst Elizabeth was thus tossed about by so many intri cate and contradictory schemes, Mary had trans mitted directions to her commissioners which de feated this last artifice. She informed them, that although she still insisted on her right to be heard in person, and adhered to her protestation, it was not her intention to pass over in silence the atro cious calumnies with which she had been assailed ; that Murray and his accomplices in accusing her had been guilty of a traitorous falsehood, and had imputed to her a crime of which they were guilty themselves. She then enjoined them to demand inspection both of the copies and the originals of 1 Goodall, vol. h., p. 279, Dec. 22, 1568."], [287, "1568. 261 REGENCY OF MURRAY. the letters which had been produced against her, and she engaged to give such an answer as should triumphantly establish her innocence. This spirited appeal, which was made by the Scottish commissioners in peremptory terms,1 threw Elizabeth into new perplexity, and.it required all the skill of Cecil to evade and parry it. Recourse was had to delay, but it produced no change, and on the 7th January, the Bishop of Ross required an audience, in which he repeated the demand in still stronger language. His royal mistress, he said, was ready to answer her calumniators, and once more required in common justice to see the letters, or at least the copies of the letters which had been pro duced by her enemies, that she might prove them to be themselves the principal authors of the mur der, and expose them to all christian princes as liars and traitors.2 This fair and moderate request Elizabeth evaded. It appeared to her better, she said, that Mary should resign the crown in favour of her son, that, on the ground of being weary of the government, she should remain privately in England, and make a compromise with her ene mies.3 It was instantly answered by Ross, that he had his mistress's command to declare that to such a condition she would never agree \u2014 if the letters were produced, and she was permitted to see the evidence against her, she was prepared to defend i Goodall, vol. h. pp. 288, 289. 2 Id.

She was ready also to entertain any honourable proposal by which a pardon might be extended to her disobedient subjects, notwith standing the greatness of their offences, but to resign her crown would be to condemn herself \u2014 it would be said, she was afraid of a public accusa tion, and shrunk from enquiry. \u2014 This, therefore, she would sooner die than consent to, and the last words she uttered should be those of a queen of Scotland.1 Elizabeth struggled violently against this deter mination, and was unwilling to receive it. She intreated Ross again to write to his mistress, but this he steadily refused. She required him and his colleagues to confer with her council. They did so, but it was only to re-iterate Mary's final resolu tion.2 It was now become absolutely necessary that the Queen of England should either grant this last request, or refuse it, and pronounce a final judg ment. Murray earnestly urged the necessity of a return to his government. From Mary no change of mind was to be expected. The regent was ac cordingly summoned before the Privy Council, and Cecil delivered to him and his associates the defin itive sentence of Elizabeth. Its terms were most extraordinary. He stated, on one hand, that as Murray and his adherents had come into England, at the desire of the queen's majesty, to answer to 1 Goodall, vol. ii. p. 301. Id. Ibid. pp. 304. January 9, 1568-9."], [289, "1568. REGENCY OF MURRAY. 263 an accusation preferred by their sovereign, she was of opinion that nothing had as yet been brought forward against them which impaired their honour or allegiance. He declared, on the other hand, with regard to Mary, that nothing had been produced or shown by them against the queen their sove reign, which should induce the Queen of England, for any tiring yet seen, to conceive an ill opinion of her good sister, and he concluded by informing Murray, that he should immediately receive per mission to return to his government.1 From this judgment, which was virtually an acquittal of Mary, it seems an inevitable inference, that the English Queen, after having had the most ample opportunities of examining the letters which had been produced, either considered them to be forge ries by the other party, or found that they had been so interpolated, garbled, and tampered with as to be unworthy of credit \u2014 for no one can deny, that if the letters were genuine, the Queen of Scots was guilty of the murder. But if Mary was acquitted, Murray also was found guiltless, and these two conclusions, so ut terly inconsistent with each other, Elizabeth had the hardihood to maintain. When we consider the solemnity of the cause, the length of the confer ences, the direct accusation of Murray and his associates, the recrimination of the queen, the evidence produced, and the impossibility that both parties could be innocent, the sentence of Eliza- 1 Goodall, vol. ii. p. 305, Jan. 10, 1568-9."], [290, "1568. 264 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. beth is perhaps the most absurd judicial opinion ever left upon record. It was followed by a scene no less remark able. A Privy Council was called at Hampton Court, on the eve of Murray's departure. It in cluded the Duke of Norfolk, the Earls of Pem broke, Derby, Bedford, and Leicester, with Sir William Cecil, and Sir Walter Mildmay. Be fore it were summoned the Bishop of Ross and Lord Herries, on the one side. On the other came Murray, Morton, Lethington, Makgill, Orkney, Balnevis, and Buchanan ; and when they were met, Cecil, rising up, delivered a message from the queen his mistress. She had determined, he said, to give the Earl of Murray and his adherents permission to depart for Scotland ; but a rumour having arisen- that they were concerned in the murder of the king, Murray had desired to be confronted with the deputies of the queen of Scots, and he now came there to know whether they would accuse him or his adherents, in their mis tress's name or in their own.1 To this challenge the queen of Scots' commis sioners immediately answered, that in their own name they had affirmed, and would affirm, nothing, but, with respect to the queen their mistress, they had received her written instructions to accuse the Earl of Murray and his adherents as the principal authors, and some of them the actual perpetrators of the murder. They had communicated, they 1 Goodall, vol. ii. p. 307."], [291, "1568. 265 REGENCY OF MURRAY. said, their sovereign's letters on this point to the queen of England \u2014 they had publicly preferred their accusation, they had constantly adhered to it \u2014 they had offered to defend the innocence of their mistress, they had demanded in vain an in spection of the letters produced against her, and even now, if exact copies were furnished, they would undertake her defence, and demonstrate, by convincing proofs, what persons were indeed guilty of the murder of the king.1 Murray strongly asserted his innocence, and offered to go to Bolton and abide in person the arraignment of his sove reign. It was answered, that such a step was wholly unnecessary, as her written accusation had been produced to the queen of England. Both parties then left the Council, and next day the regent received permission to return to Scotland, (Jan. 12.)2 It remained to dismiss their antagonists with an appearance of liberality, and being once more called before the Privy Council, Cecil intimated to them his mistress's consent, that the queen of Scots should have copies of the letters (the originals having been re-delivered to Murray), but he first required them to procure a declaration, under her seal and signature, that she would reply to the charges which they contained. It was answered, that Elizabeth had already two writings of the pre cise tenor required, under the queen's hand; to 2 Id. Ibid. p. 309. 1 Id. vol. ii. p. 308."], [292, "266 1568. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. seek for more was only a vexatious delay. The whole proceedings, from first to last, had been par tial and unjust. If the regent and his adherents were permitted to depart, why was their royal mis tress, why were they themselves debarred from the same privilege ? If the queen of England were really solicitous that she should enter upon her de fence, let her adversaries be detained until it was concluded. To this spirited remonstrance, it was coldly and briefly replied, that Murray had pro mised to return when called for, as for the Scottish commissioners, they also would probably be allowed to depart, but for many reasons the queen of Scot land could not be suffered to leave England. Against this iniquitous sentence, no redress was to be hoped for ; the deputies could only protest that nothing done by her in captivity should prejudge her honour, estate, or person, and having taken this final precaution, they left the council.1 It is difficult from the conferences at York and Westminster, to draw any certain conclusion as to the probability of Mary's guilt or innocence. Both Elizabeth and the queen of Scots acted with great art, and throughout the discussions neither the professions of the one or of the other were sin cere. Thus the English Queen, whilst she affected an extreme anxiety to promote a reconciliation between Mary and her subjects, was really de sirous that the breach should be made irrecon cilable, by the accusation of Murray, and the 1 Goodall, vol. ii., pp. 310, 313."], [293, "1568. 267 REGENCY OF MURRAY. production of the letters. Nor does there seem to be any doubt that Norfolk's assertion was correct, when he assured Lethington she had no intention of pronouncing a decision. On the other hand, it is clear that during the first part of the conferences, both Mary and her advisers, Ross, Herries, and Lethington, w*ere, from whatever motive, anxious to suppress Murray's charge, that they deprecated the production of his evidence, and were only induced to go into the investigation from the hope which Elizabeth held out that she would not permit an accusation, but exert herself, under all circumstances, to promote a reconciliation be tween the Scottish Queen and her subjects, and restore her to the throne. It must have struck the reader, that whenever by means of the pri vate letters which have been preserved, we get behind the scenes and are admitted to Mary's secret consultations with her commissioners, or to their own opinion on the conduct of the cause, we meet with no assertion of the forgery of the letters ; and it seems to me difficult to re concile her agreement to resign the crown, and sup press all enquiry, a measure only prevented by the interference of Norfolk, with her absolute inno cence. On the other hand, there are some circum stances, especially occurring during the latter part of the conferences, which tell strongly in her favour. The urgency with which from first to last she solicited a personal interview with Elizabeth, and promised if it were granted to go into her"], [294, "268 1568. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. defence; the public and oft-repeated assertion of the forgery of the letters, and the offer to prove this if copies were furnished to her commissioners; Elizabeth's evasion of this request ; her entire sup pression of these suspicious documents ; their sub sequent disappearance ; and the schemes of Nor folk for a marriage with Mary ; these are all cir cumstances which seem to me exceedingly irrecon cileable with her being directly guilty of the murder of her husband. Upon the whole, it appears to me, that in the present state of the controversy, we are really not in possession of evidence sufficient to enable any impartial enquirer to come to an absolute decision. I have already pointed out, as the circumstances occurred, such moral evidence against the queen as arose out of her conduct both before and after her marriage with Bothwell. The discussions at York and Westminster do not mate rially affect this evidence, either one way or the other, and, so far as we judge of these conferences by themselves, they leave the mind under the un satisfying and painful impression that the conduct of the Scottish Queen throughout the whole inves tigation, was that of a person neither directly guilty, nor yet wholly innocent. But, whilst animadverting on the proceedings of Elizabeth and Mary in these celebrated conferences, the conduct of the regent must not be forgotten. He was then perfectly aware of the accession of both Lethington and Morton to the murder of the king : this both prior and subsequent events proved ; yet"], [295, "1568. REGENCY OF MURRAY. 269 did he not scruple to bring these two accomplices to England, and employ Morton as his assistant in the accusation of his sovereign. Such a course, which could be dictated only by the ambition of re taining the whole power of the government in his hands, seems unworthy of the man who was the leader of the Reformation in Scotland, and professed an extraordinary regard for religion. It was cruel, selfish, and unprincipled \u2014 nor is this all. Making every allowance for the defective justice of the times, it is impossible to defend Murray's manage ment of the evidence against Mary. There can be little doubt, I think, that some letters addressed by this unfortunate princess to Bothwell did really fall into the hands of her enemies, but the regent's re fusal to produce the originals to the accused, and the state in which the copies have descended to our times, evidently garbled, altered, and interpolated, throws on him the utmost suspicion, and renders it impossible for any sincere enquirer after the truth to receive such evidence. If the only proofs of Mary's guilt had been these letters produced at Westminster, the task of her defenders would have been comparatively an easy one.1 It is the moral 1 I have purposely abstained from quoting or entering into the arguments of the writers in the controversy which has arisen on the subject of these letters, and of Mary's guilt or innocence.

But to return. Upon the conclusion of the conferences, the Scot tish Queen exerted herself to rouse her partizans in Scotland and animate them to a vindication of their independence against the practices of Elizabeth. Acting by the advice of Cecil her chief minister, the Queen of England had formed a scheme by which, under the nominal regency of Murray, she would herself have managed the whole affairs of the country. The project drawn up in the hand writing of its astute author still exists ; the young prince was to be delivered up by Murray, and edu cated in England under the eye of Elizabeth, the regent was to be continued in his office, receiving, of course, his instructions from the queen of Eng land, on whom he was to be wholly dependant ; and the queen of Scots was to be persuaded to remain where she was by arguments which Cecil minutely detailed.1 These insidious proposals were discovered by Mary, and being communicated to her friends, exaggerated by her fears and indignation, raised the utmost alarm in Scotland. The regent, it was and Chalmers. Upon the whole, my grandfather's \" Historical and Critical Enquiry,\" as it appears in the 4th Edition, London, 1 790, may still I think be appealed to, not only as the best de fence of Mary, but, in a controversy which has been deformed by much coarse and bitter invective, as the most pleasing and elegant work which has appeared on the subject. It is throughout, the production of a scholar and a gentleman. 1 MS. Brit. Mus. Caligula, C. 1, sol. 273, 22nd Dec., 1568."], [297, "1568. REGENCY OF MURRAY. 271 said, had sold the country, he was ready to deliver up the principal fortresses, he had agreed to ac knowledge the superiority of England, he looked himself to the throne, and was about to procure a deed of legitimation, by which he should be capa ble of succeeding if the young prince died without issue. Such reports flew from one end of the coun try to the other, and as he was not on the spot to contradict them, and cope with his adversaries, their effects were highly favourable to the captive queen. In the mean time, although he had received permission to return to his Government, Murray, found himself very unpleasantly situated. He was deeply in debt, and although he had lent himself an easy tool in the hands of the queen of England, she refused to assist him. If, indeed, we may believe Sir James Melvil, who had an intimate personal ac quaintance with the history of these times, she really despised him for his subserviency, and enjoyed his distresses. This was not all \u2014 the Duke of Norfolk was enraged at his late conduct. He had broken all the promises made to this nobleman, and as Nor folk commanded the whole strength of the north ern counties, through which lay Murray's route homeward, he dreaded being way-laid before he crossed the border. Nor was such an apprehension without good foundation, as a plot for his assassi nation, of which it is said both Norfolk and Mary were cognizant, was actually organized, and the execution of it committed to the Earl of Westmore-"], [298, "1568. 272 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. land.1 Under these difficulties Murray had recourse to dissimulation. With much address he procured a reconciliation with Norfolk, expressed deep contri tion for the part he had been compelled to act against his sovereign, and declared, that his feelings upon the subject of the marriage between her and the Duke remained unaltered : it was still his con viction, he said, that such a union would be emi nently beneficial to both kingdoms, and he was ready to promote it by every means in his power. To prove his sincerity he opened the matter to the Bishop of Ross, he sent Robert Melvil to pro pose it to Mary herself, he promised to use his in fluence for its furtherance with the Scottish nobles, and in the end he so completely re-assured the Duke, that this nobleman procured the regent a loan of five thousand pounds from Elizabeth, and sent the strictest injunctions to his adherents not to molest him in any way upon his return.2 With Mary herself, his artifices did not stand him in less stead. Her friends in Scotland were at this time mustering in great strength. She had appointed the Duke of Chastelherault and the Earls of Argile and Huntly her lieutenants. The tw*o earls commanded the north. The duke was ready to rise with the whole strength of the Hamil tons ; Lord Boyd and other powerful nobles were preparing for action, and had these combined forces been brought into the field, Murray must 1 Murdin's State Papers, p. 51. 2 Lesly's Negociations in Anderson vol. iii. p. 40."], [299, "1569. REGENCY OF MURRAY. 273 have been overwhelmed. But at this crisis the queen and Norfolk were deceived by his professions of repentance, and Mary, trusting to his expressions of devotion to her interest, commanded her adhe rents to abstain from all hostilities. They reluct antly obeyed, and the regent, congratulating him self on his ow*n address and the credulity of his opponents, returned secure and unmolested to his government. On his arrival in Scotland Murray dropped the mask, and exerted himself with energy against his opponents. He held a convention of the no bility, clergy, and commissaries of the burghs at Stirling, he procured an approbation of his conduct, and a ratification of his proceedings in England,1 and lastly he gave orders for a general muster of the force of the kingdom.1 On the other hand, the Duke, Cassillis, and Lord Herries, as soon as they came home assumed a bold tone, issued a proclamation, in which the regent was branded as an usurper, mustered their strength, fortified their houses, and showed a determination to put all to the arbitrement of the sword. But the rapidity with which Murray assembled his army disconcerted them. It was evident, that although willing to enter into terms, he was better prepared than his opponents to act upon the offensive ; and \u00bb MS. Letter, St. P. Off.

Murray simply insisted that Chastelherault and his adherents should acknow ledge the authority of the king. The Duke agreed to this, on condition that all who had been forfeited for their obedience to the queen, should be restored, that such measures should be taken for the main tenance of her honour and welfare as were con sistent with the sovereignty of the king, and that a committee selected from the nobles on both sides should meet at Edinburgh to deliberate upon a general pacification. It embraced the regent him self, the Duke and the Earls of Huntly, Argile, Morton, Mar, Athol, Glencairn, and Lord Her ries. For his part, Murray stipulated that these noblemen should repair to Edinburgh and return to their estates in security, whilst they agreed to disband their forces and surrender themselves or their eldest sons as a security for the performance of the treaty.2 \u00bb Diurnal of Occurrents, p. 141.

REGENCY OF MURRAY. 275 A temporary tranquillity being thus restored, the leaders of both parties repaired to Stirring, where the Archbishop of St. Andrew's the Earl of Cassillis and Lord Herries placed themselves in Murray's hands as hostages, and the regent in re turn released the prisoners taken at the battle of Langside. It was expected that he would next dis band his force, but seizing this moment of leisure, he led them against the border marauders, who, from the long interruption of justice in these dis tricts, were become formidable to both kingdoms. His expedition was successful, and it was a politic stroke, for it afforded him a good excuse for keep ing up his forces, and it taught them confidence in themselves and their leader. When he returned to the capital, it was with spirits animated by vic tory, and with a secret determination never to lay down his arms till he had compelled his enemies to submit to such terms as he was pleased to dictate. The 10th of April, being the day for the con vention of the nobles, now arrived, and accord ing to agreement, the Duke, Cassillis, Herries, and other nobles who composed the committee, (Huntly and Argile excepted), met at Edinburgh. Two points of much difficulty, and almost irrecon cileablewith each other, were to be settled \u2014 the continuance of the king's government, and the restoration and return of the captive queen ; but Murray had no serious intention of entering into discussion upon either. When, therefore, the coun sellors were assembled, he rose, and haughtily t 2"], [302, "1569. 276 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. handing a paper to the Duke of Chastelherault, desired him and his associates, before proceeding farther, to sign an acknowledgment of the king's authority. The duke remonstrated : the demand he said was unjust and premature, as the regent well knew. The object of this conference, was to deli berate on the measures to be adopted towards their captive sovereign, let him propose such measures himself, or listen to him and his friends when they brought them forward. If both parties were agreed upon them, he and his adherents were ready to subscribe to the king's authority \u2014 they had ob served every article of the late treaty, they had trusted themselves in the regent's power ; their hos tages were in his hands, their lives and their lands at his disposal ; but they had relied upon his honour most solemnly pledged, and signed, nor could they believe that he would disgrace himself by an act of fraud and tyranny. To this spirited remonstrance Murray did not vouchsafe an answer, but ordered his guards instantly to apprehend the Duke and Lord Herries. The last nobleman being the most formidable, was hurried a prisoner to the castle of Edinburgh without a moment's delay ; the duke next morning shared the same fate.1 This outrage was beheld with deep indignation by the country, and estranged from the regent some of his best friends, but it intimidated his opponents, and rendered Argile and Huntly more inclined to 1 Melvil's Memoirs, p. 219. History of James the Sext. MS. Letter, St. P. Off. Herries to Elizabeth, 5 July, 1569, pp. 39, 40."], [303, "1569. 277 REGENCY OF MURRAY. an accommodation. These noblemen wielded the whole power of the northern districts, and had re fused to sign the pacification at Glasgow. So deep was their enmity to Murray, that they had accused him in a public paper, presented during the con ferences at Westminster, of being accessory to the murder of the king, and since that time they had left nothing undone to support the interests of their sovereign, and destroy the authority of the regent. But the late scenes in the capital had alarmed them ; they saw him supported by England ; at the head of a large force ; his opponents in prison ; the southern part of the kingdom reduced to obedience ; and they deemed it prudent to enter into an accommodation. Argile consented to ac knowledge the king's authority, and was immedi ately received into favour. With Huntly, who had acted more independently for the queen, and granted commissions in her name, the arrangement was more difficult. But at last all was settled in a meeting at St. Andrew's, and the northern lord subscribed his adherence to the government, sur rendered his artillery, and delivered hostages for his peaceable behaviour (10th May).1 To secure his advantage, the regent immediately led his army into the North, reduced the country, levied heavy fines on all who had risen in favour of the queen, compelled the clans to swear allegiance, and re turned enriched and confident, to hold a great i MS.

The project had originated in the busy and politic brain of Lethington, it had been encouraged and furthered by the regent, and its success was ardently anticipated by the duke, who carried on a correspondence with Mur ray upon the subject, and trusted in the end to pro cure the consent of his own sovereign. A secret of this kind, however, is difficult to keep in a court ; and something coming to Elizabeth's ears, she broke forth with much passion, and attacked the duke, who saved himself by his address. He would ad mit, he said, that proposals had been made to him on the subject by some noblemen. These he could not have prevented, but he had never seriously en tertained them, and indeed, he was not likely to do so, as he loved to sleep upon a safe pillow.2 His earnestness re-assured Elizabeth, and Norfolk be lieving that he had lulled all her suspicions, had the rashness and folly to continue his correspond ence with Mary. After some time, the scheme assumed a definite 1 MS. Letter, St. P. Off. Murray to Cecil, Aberdeen, July 8, 1569. \" Trial of the Duke of Norfolk, Jardine, vol. i., p. 162."], [305, "1569. REGENCY OF MURRAY. 279 form, and was secretly supported by a large party of the nobility in both countries. Leicester ear nestly promoted it, the Earls of Arundel, Pem broke, Bedford, Shrewsbury, Northumberland, and Westmoreland, gave it their full concurrence. Sir Nicholas Throkmorton laboured warmly in the cause ; even the cautious Cecil, to whom it was early communicated, contributed his advice.1 In Scotland the plan was managed by Leth ington, the regent, and his secretary Wood, whilst the Bishop of Ross, and the Lord Boyd, communi cated with Mary, who corresponded with the duke, and professed her readiness to be divorced from Bothwell. Nothing in short was wanting, but the consent of Elizabeth, and the concurrence of the Scottish nobility. To conciliate and convince the English Queen, Leicester proposed that Lethington should repair to England. To ensure the second, it was resolved that the matter should be brought before that convention of the whole nobility, which was to meet at Perth on Murray's return from the North. In the meantime whilst these secret transactions were carefully concealed, the Bishop of Ross, who remained in England, carried on an open negocia tion for his mistress's restoration. To this Eliza beth, with the desire of keeping a check over Murray, affected to listen, and Lord Boyd was despatched with some proposals on this subject, to 1 Lesly's Negociations, Anderson, vol. iii., pp. 51, 61, 62. Camden's Elizabeth, Kennet, vol. ii. p. 420."], [306, "280 1569. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. be communicated first to Mary herself, and after wards when she had given her consent, to be broken to the Scottish nobility. These articles, Camden affirms, were drawn up by Leicester.1 They stipu lated that the Scottish Queen, on condition of being reinstated in the government of her kingdom, should enter into a perpetual league with England, estab lish the Protestant religion, receive to favour her rebellious subjects, and give assurance to Elizabeth that neither she nor her issue should be molested by any claims upon the English throne. Another article was added on the marriage with Norfolk, but was carefully concealed from the English Queen. It recommended this union, as the only measure which was likely to restore tranquillity to both kingdoms, and to enforce it more effectually, Leicester and his friends despatched a special mes senger, Mr. Candish, who accompanied Lord Boyd to Tutbury, and carried letters and costly presents to Mary.2 To some of the conditions she imme diately consented, on others she demurred and requested time to consult her foreign allies, as to the projected marriage ; her sorrowful experience, she said, inclined her to prefer a solitary life, yet if the remaining conditions were settled to her sa tisfaction, she was not indisposed to Norfolk, pro vided Elizabeth were consulted and her consent obtained.3 1 Camden's Elizabeth.

On receiving this favourable reply, Norfolk be came impatient to complete Iris ambitious pro ject. He courted popularity, kept open house, strengthened himself by every possible means, and communicated his design to the French and Spa nish ambassadors, who after consulting their courts, gave him their encouragement and support. Nor did he neglect the Scottish Regent, with whom he kept up a close correspondence, and who assured him of his continued fidelity and devotion to his ser vice. It may seem strange that Norfolk should have so long delayed to sound Elizabeth upon his great design, but Leicester, in whom he chiefly confided, strongly dissuaded him from any premature disclo sure, and the deeper he and his confederates were engaged in their secret intrigues, the more they shrunk from the dreaded task of revealing them to a princess whose violence and severity held them in constant awe. Meanwhile, though kept in the dark as to the marriage, the English Queen was urged to conclude an agreement for the restoration of Mary on the ground of those articles which had been submitted to her by the Bishop of Ross, and after a conference with her privy council, Lord Boyd was dispatched upon this business into Scotland.1 This nobleman carried with him letters to the regent from Eliza beth, Mary, the Duke of Norfolk, and Sir Nicho las Throkmorton, and meeting Murray at Elgin, 1 Lesly's Negotiations, Anderson, vol. iii. p. 54, 55."], [308, "1569. 282 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. on Ms return from his northern expedition, he im mediately laid before him his dispatches and in structions.1 The letters of Elizabeth contained three propositions in Mary's behalf, and she inti mated her desire that one or the other of them should be adopted. She might be restored, she said, fully and absolutely to her royal estate \u2014 or, se condly, she might be united in the government with her son, and retain the title of queen, whilst the administration continued in the regent till the prince had attained the age of seventeen \u2014 or lastly, she might return to Scotland, as a private person, and be honourably maintained in quiet and retirement. In Mary's own letter, which was brought by Lord Boyd, she briefly intimated her desire that judges should be appointed to decide upon the lawful ness of her marriage with Bothwell, and should it be pronounced illegal, her request was, that sentence of nullity should be pronounced, so that she might be free to marry where she pleased. This request evidently pointed to the projected union with Norfolk, and the subject was insisted on in the letters of the duke himself and Sir N. Throk morton. Norfolk, in addressing the regent, con tented himself with warm professions of friendship, and assured him that as to his marriage with the queen his sister, he never meant to recede from his promise, having proceeded so far that he could not go back without dishonour. He referred him to Lord Boyd, who was fully instructed by Mary and 1 Lesl/s Negotiations, Anderson, vol. hi. p. 70."], [309, "1569. REGENCY OF MURRAY. 283 himself to reply to any doubts which he might en tertain, and begged him to believe that he felt for him the affection not only of a faithful friend, but a natural brother.1 Throkmorton's letters were addressed both to Murray and to Lethington. To the regent he ob served, that the time was come when he must give up all his conscientious scruples and objections. The match was now supported by a party too powerful and too numerous to be resisted. If he opposed it, his overthrow was inevitable. If he promoted it, no man's friendship would be so highly prized, no man's estimation be greater or more popular. In his letter to Lethington, Throk morton urged the necessity of his hastening to court for the purpose of breaking the affair to Elizabeth. Of her consent, he said, he need have no doubt. She was too wise a princess to risk the tranquillity of her government, her own security, and the hap piness of her people for the gratification of her own fancy, or the passions of any inconsiderate indivi dual, and he concluded by assuring him, that the wisest, noblest, and mightiest persons in England were all engaged upon their side. On receiving these letters, the regent, as we have seen, summoned a convention of the nobility at Perth, on the 25th of July; an assembly of the church was held at the same time in the capital, and com missioners deputed from it to the meeting of the nobles.

Murray should fail to perceive that the queen's restoration and the proposed marriage, if carried into effect, must be a death blow to his power, and whilst he affected to fulfil his engagements to the duke with scrupulous fidelity, he secretly persuaded his partizans to oppose the match with their utmost influence.1 When Boyd delivered his letters at the conven tion, containing Elizabeth's three proposals, the effect of this disingenuous dealing was perceived : Mary's full restoration to her dignity was refused, her association with the young king in the go vernment was also declared dangerous and impos sible, but the third scheme for her restoration to liberty, and being reduced to a private condition within her dominions, appeared to them more likely to succeed. The assembly, however, arrived at no definite resolution, and when the queen's letter regarding a divorce from Bothwell was laid before them, a violent debate arose between Le thington and his friends, who secretly supported the intended marriage with Norfolk, and Makgill, the clerk register, with the leaders of the Presby terian party. It was argued by the secretary, be tween whom and Murray there had recently been great coldness, that the divorce might be concluded without injury or disrespect either to the king or the church. To this Makgill answered, that Mary's own letters confuted him, and insulted 1 Lesly's Negotiations, Anderson, vol. hi. p. 71. MS. St. P. Off.

The king was their only head and master, yet she still addressed them as her subjects, and subscribed herself their queen. The Bishop of St. Andrew's was a heretic, a mem ber cut off from the true vine, an obstinate rebel and papist, yet she wrote to him as the head of the church. To vouchsafe an answer to such an application, would be, in some measure, to admit its justice \u2014 to grant it, nothing less than treason and blasphemy. It was in vain that Lethington at tempted a reply, and sarcastically insinuated that they who were so recently anxious for the queen's separation from Bothwell, had now altered their tone with unaccountable versatility. He was inter rupted by Richardson, the treasurer, who started from his seat, calling the assembly to witness that the secretary had argued against the king's au thority, and protested that any who dared to sup port him should be accounted traitors and dealt with accordingly. This appeal finished the con troversy, and Mary's proposal for a divorce was indignantly rejected.1 The assembly then broke up, with mutual expressions of contempt and defi ance, the queen's deliverance appearing still more distant than before. But if the affairs of this unfortunate princess were thus unsuccessful in her own dominions, an event which now happened in England over whelmed her with fresh affliction. The renewed i MS.

Leicester and his associates hastened to propitiate her resentment by a full discovery, and basely purchased their own security with the betrayal of Norfolk. His exam ple was followed by Murray, who with equal mean ness, on the first challenge of the English Queen, delivered up the whole of his secret correspondence with Norfolk, and excused himself by declaring that a fear of assassination had compelled him to join a conspiracy, of which he secretly disapproved.3 He pleaded also, and with some reason, that Eliza beth's own conduct was enough to mitigate her 1 Maitland, vol. ii. p. 1090. 2 Spottiswood, p. 231. 3 MS.

If she had adopted a decided part against Mary, they would have known how to re ceive Norfolk's proposals\u2014 but her vaccillating po licy, and the favour with which the captive queen was treated, created, he said, an equal uncertainty in his mind, and that of his supporters.1 As for the unfortunate Duke himself, he appears to have acted with that indecision which in matters of this kind, and with such an adversary as Eliza beth, is commonly fatal. His friends admonished him to throw off the mask and take the field at once, and had he followed their advice his popularity was so great that the consequences might have been serious ; but he rejected their advice, and in an apology addressed to the queen, assured her that it had been his fixed resolution throughout the whole course of the negotiations never to marry the queen of Scots without the consent of his sove reign. His guilt lay in the delay, but his allegiance was untainted, and his devotion to her service as entire as it had always been. This letter was sent from Kenninghall, his seat in Norfolk, to which he had precipitately retired on his first suspicion of a discovery. Elizabeth's reply was an immediate summons to the court. The Duke did not venture to obey without first consulting Cecil. The secre tary assured him that he was safe. He complied, and was instantly arrested and lodged in the Tower.2 1 MS. Letter, St. P.

The discovery was followed by a more rigorous confinement of the Scottish Queen, who was now removed from Winkfield to Tutbury, her reposito ries were ransacked for letters, and she was com mitted to the custody of the Earl of Huntingdon, a nobleman particularly obnoxious to her, who was associated in this charge with Shrewsbury her former keeper.1 Her most trusty domestics were dismissed, the number of her attendants diminished, her letters intercepted and conveyed to the queen of England, and all her actions so rigorously watched, that it became impossible for her to com municate even in the most common affairs with her friends.2 Nothing can more strongly mark the sudden and extraordinary changes of these times than an event which soon after occurred in Scotland \u2014 the arraign ment of Lethington. The regent, since the dis covery of his intrigues with Norfolk, had fallen into suspicion with Elizabeth. His secretary Wood, also, who had been entrusted with his negotiations at the English court, by bis duplicity and false dealing had incurred her resentment ; and although Murray hastened to appease her, by a delivery of the letters which convicted the Duke, she was aware that Lethington still intrigued upon the sub ject, and suspected that the regent, from their long habits of intimacy, might be induced to favour his designs. Her fears, indeed, on this point, proved 1 Haynes, pp. 526-527. 2 Lesly's Negociations.

But of this estrangement Elizabeth was ignorant. She therefore directed Cecil to keep a vigilant eye upon the operations of the regent ; Lord Hunsdon, the governor of Berwick, received the same instructions ; the proceedings of the conven tion at Perth and the subsequent conduct of the Scottish governor wrere severely criticised, and he found to his mortification that whilst he had incur red extreme odium by the betrayal of Norfolk, he was himself an object of suspicion. Whilst Elizabeth, however, only suspected Mur ray, she was incensed to the highest degree against Lethington, whom she now discovered to be the originator of the marriage plot and the greatest partizan of Norfolk. This restless and indefatigable politician, since his unsuccessful efforts in the con vention at Perth, had sought security in Athol, where he was surrounded by his friends, and continued to incite them to renew their exertions in favour of the Scottish Queen ; and Murray, who like other victims of ambition, had become sufficiently un scrupulous in the means which he adopted to con solidate his power, resolved to recommend himself to Elizabeth by the ruin of his former associate. Under the pretence of requiring his immediate assistance at Stirling, in the business of the go vernment, he requested the secretary to leave his retreat in Athol and return to court.

With a smile of calm contempt he ob served, that his long continued services might have exempted him from so foul and false a charge, pre ferred, too, by so mean a person, but he was ready to find surety to stand his trial on any day which was appointed and he had no fears for the verdict. Crawford, however, still kneeling, warmly remon strated against his being left at large. He, a gentle man, and a servant of the late king,2 had publicly arraigned that guilty man of treason, he was ready to prosecute and adduce his proofs, and under such circumstances he appealed to the council whether bail could possibly be accepted. After a vio lent debate it was determined, that the secretary should be committed, and Murray, who secretly con gratulated himself on the issue of his intrigue, car ried him to the capital and confined him in the 1 MS.

At the same time a party of horse were dispatched to Fife, who surrounded Balfour's residence at Monymeil, and brought him and his brother George prisoners to Edinburgh.1 The arrest of Lethington increased the unpo pularity of the regent ; but his victim had scarcely fallen into his hands ere he was again torn from him ; for the secretary's old associate Grange, dreading some new treachery of Murray and Mor ton, now closely leagued together, attacked the house in which he was confined, and, by a mixture of stratagem and courage,2 carried him off in tri umph to the castle. This rescue deeply mortified Murray, who believed that in securing Lethington he was not only performing an acceptable service to Elizabeth, but removing the most formidable op ponent of his own government. He dissembled his indignation, however, and as the secretary still de clared his readiness to answer the accusation, contented himself with appointing the 22nd of Nov. as the day of trial. Meanwhile England became disturbed by a re bellion in the northern counties, which at first as sumed a formidable appearance. Its leaders were 1 MS. Letter, St. P. Off.

So imminent did the danger at first appear, that Elizabeth issued an order un der the great seal for Mary's execution, which seems only to have been arrested by the sudden and total failure of the insurrection.1 It arose from the intrigues of the Duke of Norfolk and the hopes excited amongst the English Romanists by the anti cipated restoration of Mary. Amongst Norfolk's most powerful friends were the Earls of Northumberland and Westmoreland, two peers of ancient family, great alliance, and steady attachment to the Ro mish church. They commanded the strength of the northern counties, and, had Norfolk chosen to have bid defiance to Elizabeth, they were ready to have risen in arms in his defence. His submission and imprisonment broke, but did not put an end to, their intrigues, and irritated at his desertion they sought the support of the King of Spain, and secured the services of the Duke of Alva and the Bishop of Ross. This prelate, a man of great talents and rest less intrigue, was the ambassador and confidential minister of the Scottish Queen, and by his secret negotiations his mistress, who in her first imprison ment at Bolton had kept up a correspondence with Northumberland,2 became involved in these new 1 See Proofs and Illustrations, No. 3.

Alva promised to assist the two Earls with a large body of men, and sent over the Marquis Vitelli, one of his best officers, under the pretence of a mission to Elizabeth, but really to forward the rebellion. Before, however, these preparations were completed, Elizabeth obtained a knowledge of the plot, and instantly summoned both to court. Whilst they hesitated, intelli- gence arrived that Sussex, the queen's lieutenant in the north, had received orders to arrest them, and scarce was this message delivered when Northum- berland's castle was beset by a body of horse. He escaped with difficulty, joined the Earl of West- moreland, and, as the only chance now lest them, they dropped the mask and broke into rebellion. An enterprise thus prematurely forced on, could scarcely be successful. In their proclamation the two earls professed a devoted attachment to the queen's person, and declared their only object to be the restoration of the faith of their fathers, the dismis- sal of false councillors, and the liberation of Nor- folk. They had confidently looked to being joined by the large body of the English Roman Catholics all over the country, but their utmost strength never amounted to six thousand men, and these soon melted away into a more insignificant force. Sir John Forster, the Warden of the Middle Marches, made himself master of Northumberland's cas tles of Alnwick and Warkworth, and by taking possession of the principal passes, effectually cut off all communication between the earl and his vassals"], [320, "294 1569. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. in those parts. Thence marching to Newcastle, and being joined by Sir Henry Percy, Northumber land's brother, he speedily reduced the rebels in the northern parts of Durham, so that when Sussex took the field with seven thousand men, the rebel lion was already expiring.1 The two rebel earls, with a force which dimi nished every hour, retired first upon Hexham, and afterwards fell back upon Naworth Castle, in Cum berland. Here they suddenly dispersed their little army, and fled with a handful of horse into Scotland. Westmoreland took refuge with the lairds of Buccleugh and Farnyhirst, two of the most pow erful chiefs in those parts, whilst Northumberland, in company with black Ormiston, a traitor who was present at the king's murder, the Laird's Jock, and other border banditti, threw himself into the Harlaw, a stronghold of the Armstrongs.2 These events passed with so much rapidity, that Murray, who, on the first intelligence of the insurrection, had professed his readiness to assist Elizabeth with the whole forces of the realm, was scarcely able to muster his strength before he heard that assist ance was unnecessary.

Grange was in posses sion of the Castle of Edinburgh, within which now lay his friend Lethington, Lord Herries, the Archbishop of St. Andrew's, and others who sup ported the cause of Mary, professing, at the same time, their attachment to their prince, and an earnest desire for the pacification of the country. Opposed to them was the Regent, supported by England and the party of the Kirk, who kept up a constant correspondence with Cecil, Eliza beth's minister, and whose measures were entirely dictated and overruled by English influence. Since his accession to the chief power in the state, but more especially since the termination of the conferences at Westminster, Murray's popu larity had been on the decline. Men blamed his conduct to his sovereign, his treachery to his associates, Iris haughtiness to his own country men, Iris humility and subserviency to a foreign power, as England was then considered. They accused him of being surrounded by troops of low and needy flatterers, who prospered upon the ruin of the ancient nobility, and persuaded him to betray his former friends, by whose efforts he had been placed in the regency. They declared, and with some truth, that having once sold himself to Eng land, he had become insensible to every suggestion of honour and good faith.

Duke of Chastelherault, his treacherous accusation of Lethington, his threatened severity to Northum berland \u2014 all this weighed strongly against him, and those who had been most willing to anticipate the happiest results from his administration, were now ready to acknowledge their mortification and disap pointment.1 Yet, although thus fallen in public estimation, and surrounded by enemies, Murray, naturally daring and intrepid, showed no symptoms of decreasing energy ; and as the time approached wiien Lethington was to stand Iris trial for the murder of the king, he appeared fully determined to insist on the prosecution. When the day arrived, however, a scene pre sented itself very different from the pacific solem nities of public justice ; Lord Home, at an early hour, occupied the city with a large body of horse. He was speedily followed by multitudes of the secretary's friends, all armed and surrounded by their retainers ; and as every hour was increasing the concourse, Morton, a principal accuser of Lethington, refused to risk his person within the city. Amidst this warlike concourse, Clement Little, an able advocate of the time, entered where the Council had assembled, and protested, that, as his client, the secretary, was ready to stand his trial, and no prosecutor had appeared, he was entitled to a verdict of acquittal. Mur ray, however, who had taken care to be strongly guarded, rose up, and declared, that as long as 1 Melvil's Memoirs, p. 220."], [323, "1569. REGENCY OF MURRAY. 297 the town was occupied by armed troops, no trial should take place, and no verdict be pronounced. He had been placed, he said, by their unsolicited suffrages, in the first office in the state ; he had given his solemn oath to administer justice ; they had promised to obey the king, and assist him in maintaining the law. What, then, meant this armed assembly? Was it thus they fulfilled their pro mise ? or did they think to intimidate him into their opinion. That, at least, he should show them was a vain expectation, and therefore he now prorogued the trial till quiet was restored, and they were pre pared, having laid aside their arms, to resume the demeanour of peaceable subjects. Such was Mur ray's speech, as reported by himself in a letter written next day to Cecil ; but we learn, from the same source, that the regent was daily expecting a communication from Elizabeth, containing her instructions how to conduct himself in Lethington's case, and that he delayed the trial to give time for their arrival \u2014 an additional proof of his entire sub serviency to England.1 He concluded the same letter by an allusion to the recent rebellion in the north : \u2014 \" I have offered,\" said he, \" already to Mr. Marshall, of Berwick, (he meant Sir William Drury) to take such part in her highness' cause and quarrel with the whole power of this realm, that will do for me, as he shall advertise 1 MS.

This villain, bribed by the regent's gold, sold the English earl to Murray, who carried him to Edin burgh, and soon after imprisoned him in Loch le ven.3 Although this new act of severity and corruption increased the regent's unpopularity in Scotland, it i MS.

This emboldened him to make a proposal on which he had long meditated, and for which the English Queen was by no means prepared. It was no less than that she should sur render Mary into his hands to be kept safely in Scotland, a solemn promise being given by him, \" that she should live her natural life, without any sinister means taken to shorten the same.\"1 It was added that a maintenance suitable to her high rank should be provided for her, and the arguments ad dressed to Elizabeth upon the subject, in a paper entrusted to Nicholas Elphinston, who was sent with the request to the English court, were drawn up with no little art and ability.

At the same time Knox addressed a letter to Cecil. He described himself as writing with one foot in the grave, alluded to the late rebel lion, and recommended him to strike at the root, meaning Mary, if he would prevent the branches from budding again. It appears to me that the ex pressions of this great reformer, whose stern spirit was little softened by age, go as far as to urge the absolute necessity of putting Ma'ry to death, but his words are somewhat dark and enigmatical. The letter, which is wholly in his own hand, is too re markable to be omitted. \" Benefits of God's hands received, crave that men be thankful, and danger known would be avoided.

He was directed to impress upon Elizabeth in the strongest manner, the difficulties with which Mur ray was surrounded, the daily increasing power of his and her enemies, who supported the cause of the captive queen both in England and Scotland, the perpetual tumults and intrigues of the Roman Catholics in both realms, their intercourse with Philip of Spain and the Pope, who were animating them at that very moment to new exertions, the succours hourly looked for from France, and the utter impossibility of the regent keeping up the Strangely. s At. \u00bb MS.

It was necessary, he said, to prevent the ruin of the cause, that the queen of England and his master should distinctly understand each other. She had lately urged him to deliver up her rebel the Earl of Northumberland, to pay the penalty of a traitor. It was a hard request, and against every feeling of honour and humanity, to surrender a banished man to slaughter, but he was ready to consent, if in ex change the queen of Scots were committed into his hands, and if at the same time, Elizabeth would sup port the cause of his young sovereign, and the inter ests of true religion, by an immediate advance of mo ney, and a seasonable present of arms and ammuni tion.1 If this, were agreed to, then he was ready to con tinue his efforts for the maintenance of the Govern ment in Scotland against the machinations of their enemies; he would not only preserve her amity, but \" would serve her majesty in England, as they are accustomed to do their native princes in Scot land, and out of England, upon reasonable wages.\" If she would not consent to this, then he must for bear any longer to venture his rife as he had done, and it would be well for her to consider what dan gers might ensue to both the realms, by the in- 1 MS.

Above all he entreated her to remember (alluding as it appears to me, to the subject of Knox's letter), that the heads of all these troubles were at her commandment, that this late rebellion was not now ended, but had more dangerous branches, for which, if she did not pro vide a remedy, the fault must he upon herself.1 These secret negotiations were detected by the vigilance of the Bishop of Ross, and he instantly pre sented a protest to the queen of England against a proposition, which, if agreed to was, he said, equivalent to signing Mary's death warrant. He solicited also the ambassadors of France and Spain to remonstrate against it, and La Motte Fenelon addressed an earnest letter to the Queen mother upon the subject.2 Some little time, too, was gained by the refusal of the Scottish nobles to de liver up Northumberland, and Elizabeth had dis patched Sir Henry Gates and the Marshal of Ber wick with a message to the regent, when an ap palling event suddenly interrupted the treaty. This was the murder of Murray himself in the town of Linlithgow, by James Hamilton of Bothwellhaugh. The assassination is to be chiefly traced to the influence of private revenge ; but there is no doubt also, that the author of the deed was the tool of a 1 MS. St. P. Off.

He was a gentleman of good family, had been made prisoner at Langside, and with others was condemned to death, but the regent had spared his rife, and been satisfied with the for feiture of his estate. His wife was heiress of Woodhouselee, a small pro perty on the river Esk, to which she had retreated, under the mistaken idea that it would be exempted from the sentence of outlawry, which affected her husband's estate of Bothwellhaugh. But Bellenden, the justice clerk, a favourite of Murray's, who had obtained a grant of the escheat,1 violently occupied the house and barbarously turned its mistress, du ring a bitterly cold night, and almost in a state of nakedness, into the w*oods, where she was found in the morning furiously mad, and insensible to the injury which had been inflicted on her. If ever revenge could meet with sympathy it would be in so atrocious a case as this ; and from that mo ment Bothwellhaugh resolved upon Murray's death, accusing him as the chief author of the cala mity. It is affirmed by Calderwood, that he had twice failed in his sanguinary purpose, when the Hamiltons, who had long hated the regent, en couraged him to make a third attempt, which proved successful.2 Nothing could be more deliberate than the man- 1 The forfeited property. 2 MS.

In this town, and in the High Street, through which the cavalcade generally passed, was a house belonging to the archbishop, his uncle. Here he took his station in a small room or wooden gallery, which commanded a full view of the street. To prevent his heavy footsteps being heard, for he was booted and spurred, he placed a featherbed on the floor ; to secure against any chance observation of his shadow, which, had the sun broke out, might have caught the eye, he hung up a black cloth on the opposite wall, and, having barricaded the door in the front, he had a swift horse ready saddled in the stable at the back. Even here his preparations did not stop, for, observing that the gate in the wall which enclosed the garden was too low to admit a man on horseback, he removed the lintel stone, and returning to his chamber cut in the wooden panel, immediately below the lattice window where he watched, a hole just sufficient to admit the barrel of his caliver.1 Having taken these precautions he loaded the piece with four bullets and calmly awaited his victim. The regent had received repeated warnings of his danger ; and on the morning of the murder, John Hume, an attached follower, implored him not to ride through the principal street, but pass round by the back of the town, promising to bring him to the very spot where they might seize the 1 History of King James the Sext, p. 46.

The same cause compelled him to ride at a slow pace, so that the assassin had time to take a deliberate aim ; and as he passed the fatal house, he shot him right through the lower part of the body ; the bullet entering above the belt of his doublet, came out near the hucklebone, and killed the horse of Arthur Douglas, who rode close beside him.2 The very suddenness and suc cess of this atrocious action produced a horror and confusion which favoured the murderer's escape ; and mounting his horse with the weapon of his revenge still warm in his grasp, he was already many miles from the spot, whilst the people, infu riated at the sight of their bleeding governor, were in vain attempting to break open the door of the lodging from which the shot proceeded. A few, however, caught a sight of him as he fled, and giving chace observed that he took the road to Hamilton.3 Here he was received in triumph by the Bishop of St. Andrew's, the Lord Arbroath, of whom Bothwellhaugh was a retainer, and the whole 1 MS.

Mortal symptoms, however, soon ap peared, and when made acquainted with them he received the information with his usual calm de meanour. When his friends bitterly lamented his fate, remarking that he might long since have taken the miscreant's life, and observing that his clemency had been his ruin, Murray mildly answered, that they would never make him re pent of any good he had done in his rise ; and after faintly but affectionately commending the charge of the young prince to such of the nobility as were present, he died tranquilly a little before midnight.2 i MS.

I will not attempt any laboured character of this extraordinary man, who, coming into the pos session of almost uncontrolled power, as the leader of the Reformed party, when he was little more than a youth, was cut off in the midst of his great ness before he was forty years old.1 Living in those wretched times, when the country was torn by two parties which mortally hated each other, he has come down to us so disfigured by the pre judices of his contemporaries that it is difficult to discern his true features. As to his personal in trepidity, his talents for state affairs, his military capacity, and the general purity of his private life, in a corrupt age and court, there can be no differ ence of opinion. It has been recorded of him, that he ordered himself and his family in such sort, that it did more resemble a church than a court f and it is but fair to conclude that this proceeded from his deep feelings of religion, and a steady attach ment to a reformation, which he believed to be founded on the word of God. But, on the other hand, there are some facts, especially such as occurred during the latter part of his career, which throw sus picion upon his motives, and weigh heavily against him. He consented to the murder of Riccio ; to compass his own return to power, he unscrupulously leagued himself with men whom he knew to be the murderers of the king ; used their evidence to con vict his sovereign ; and refused to turn against them 1 He was born in 1530, and slain in 1569-70. \u2022 Spottiswood, p. 233."], [335, "1570. 309 REGENCY OF MURRAY. till they began to threaten his power, and declined to act as the tools of his ambition. If we regard private faith and honour, how can we defend his betrayal of Norfolk, and his consent to deliver up Northumberland ; if we look to love of country, a principle now perhaps too lightly esteemed, but in separable from all true greatness, what are we to think of his last ignominious offers to Elizabeth ? if we go higher still, and seek for that love which is the only test of religious truth, how difficult is it to think that it could have a place in his heart, whose last transaction went to aggravate the imprison ment, if not to recommend the death, of a miserable princess, his own sister and his sovereign. All are agreed that he was a noble looking per sonage, of grave and commanding manners. His funeral, which was a solemn spectacle, took place on the 14th of February, in the High Church of St. Giles, at Edinburgh, where he was bu ried in St. Anthony's Aisle. The body had been taken from Linlithgow to Stirling, and thence was transported by water to Leith, and carried to the palace of Holyrood.

Its consequences threatened to unite closely the party which favoured the restoration of Mary, and were solicitous for a general pacification. The Hamiltons, Lethington, Herries, Huntly, and Ar gile had vigorously resisted the measures of the re gent, and felt impatient under the ascendancy of English influence, which Murray, Morton, and their faction had introduced. That \" inestimable commodity,\"1 an English party in Scotland, which Elizabeth's ministers described as having been so difficult to attain, and so invaluable in its effects, was now threatened with destruction ; and Lord Hunsdon, the very day after Murray's death, wrote in anxious terms, requiring the queen's immediate 1 Anderson's Collections, vol. iv., P. i., p. 104."], [338, "312 1570.

Important mat ters, he said, depended and would fall out by this event, and much vigilance would be required to watch \" the great faction which remained, who were all French.\"1 Nor were these apprehensions exaggerated. If Elizabeth looked to her owti realm, it was full of discontented subjects, and on the very eve of ano ther rebellion. If to Scotland, Mary's adherents were in a state of high elatedness and hope ;2 the Hamiltons had already taken arms, the castles of Edinburgh and Dumbarton were in the hands of her friends, succours had arrived in the Clyde from France, and on the morning after the regent's death, Scott of Buccleugh, and Car of Farnyhirst, two of the mightiest of the border chiefs, broke into England, and in a destructive \" raid,\" let loose their vengeance. In their company was Nevil, the banished Earl of Westmoreland, a rough soldier and devoted friend of Mary, who, as Hunsdon wrote Cecil, had testified his joy on hearing of Murray's death, by casting his hat into the fire, replacing it no doubt by a steel bonnet. All this was ground for much anxiety at home, and the prospect was not more encouraging abroad. In France the news of Murray's assassination pro- i MS. Letter, St. P. Off. B.C.

He had brought letters to the friends of Mary, sewed under the buttons of his coat, had twice supplied them with money, and warmly exhorted them to keep up the contest until assistance arrived from Philip.2 These were all alarming indications, and the papers of Elizabeth's vigilant and indefatigable minister Cecil, contain ample proof that he was not insensible to the importance of the crisis. In an able but somewhat Macchiavelian memorial on the state of the realm, drawn up on the very eve of Murray's murder, and the arguments in which were greatly strengthened by that event,3 he stated the perils both in respect of persons and matters to be many, great, and imminent, pointed out the increasing strength of the Romish party all over Europe, the decay and probable extinction of the Protestant power in France and Flanders, the weakening of all those counter forces which his mistress had hitherto been successful in raising against it, and the well known resolution of the court of Rome, and the three great powers of Spain, Austria, and 1 MS.

France, never to intermit their efforts until they had destroyed England, and placed its crown upon the head of the Scottish Queen. In the same paper he called her attention to that unceasing encou ragement to intrigue and rebellion, which was held out by Mary's presence in England, and the grow ing unanimity and power of her party at home. All this, it was evident, called for immediate exertion, and, in Cecil's opinion, there was but one way to provide a remedy, or at least to arrest the evil in its progress. Scotland was the field on which Elizabeth's domestic and foreign enemies were uniting against her. The strength of that country lay in the union of its various factions, which previous to Murray's death had been nearly accomplished by the efforts of Lethington and Grange, and which this event threatened to accele rate. Her policy, then, must be, to prevent a pacification, keep up an English party, and find her own peace in the dissensions and misery of her neighbour. For this end two instruments were necessary, and must instantly be procured \u2014 the first an ambassador, who, under the mask of a peace maker, might sow the seeds of disquiet and con fusion : the second a regent, who would submit to her dictation. She found the one in Sir Thomas Randolph, an accomplished master in political in trigue, whom she dispatched to Scotland only three days after the death of Murray.1 For the second, 1 MS.

Immediately after the regent's death, this noble man had addressed a \" supplication to Elizabeth representing the great danger in which it left the in fant king, his grandson, her majesty's near kinsman, and suggesting the propriety of extending her pro tection to the \"little innocent,\" by getting him deli vered into her own hands.1 This had been always a favourite project of the queen's, and disposed her to think favourably of Lennox, but another cause recommended him still more strongly. There had long existed a deadly hatred between the two great houses of Hamilton and Lennox, and no more effectual method to kindle a flame in Scotland could have been adopted, than the elevation of this noble man to the first rank in the government.2 In the meantime Elizabeth received a letter from Lord Hunsdon, the governor of Berwick, which in some degree quieted her apprehensions, and gave her better hopes than he had at first held out.

The conference w*as opened by Makgill, who assured the English envoys of their continued de votion to Elizabeth, and betrayed an evident terror lest she should set their queen at liberty and send her home amongst them. They spoke of an ap proaching convention of the nobility, but declared that if the queen of England would accept their services, secure their religion, and aid them to resist the intrusion of foreigners, they would run with her the same course which Murray had done, and decide on nothing till they knew her pleasure \u2014 as to a regent, her majesty would do well, they said, to think of the Earl of Lennox, a Stewart by birth, a Douglas by marriage, and at that time within her majesty's realm. If she. would send him, they were ready to make him the head of their faction, and should she wish him to be ac companied by any confidential person whose advice he might use, they would gladly receive him also. In the concluding passage of Hunsdon's letter to the queen, he entreated her when such \" good stuff was offered,\" not to hesitate about its accept ance\u2014adding, that if the Hamiltons were allowed"], [343, "1570. 317 INTERREGNUM. to bear the chief sway, the French would not be long absent. Lastly, he implored her to watch the Bishop of Ross, and take good heed to the Scottish Queen.1 Randolph soon after arrived in the capital, and notwithstanding the encouraging assurances of Morton and his friends, found things in an un settled state.* Yet this was far from ungratify ing to a minister who considered that the strength of his royal mistress lay in the dissensions of her neighbours. A messenger had been sent from Argile and the Hamiltons, who warned their op ponents not to acknowledge any other authority than the queen's, declaring that as her lieute nants in Scotland,3 they were ready to punish the regent's murder, but ridiculing the idea that the whole race of Hamilton were guilty because the murderer bore their name.

Dacres and his brother fled into Scotland, where his presence along with Westmoreland and Northumberland, formed a just subject of complaint and jealousy to the English Queen.1 Scotland in the mean time presented a melan choly spectacle, torn between two factions, one professing allegiance to the captive queen, the other supporting the king's authority, both pre tending an equal desire for the peace of their coun try, but thwarted in every effort to accomplish it by their own ambition and the intrigues of England.

The intrigues of Norfolk, the successive north ern rebellions, the flight of the disaffected into Scotland, the invasion of Buccleugh and Farny hirst, the fact that this \" Raid \" had been especi ally cruel, and that its leaders had shown a fore knowledge of Murray's death, besides the per petual alarm in which she w7as kept by the dread of French intervention and Spanish intrigue, had roused her passion to so high a pitch, that she commanded Sussex, her lieutenant in the north, to advance into Scotland at the head of 7,000 men.

But Elizabeth was much excited ; Randolph, at this moment, had warned her of a conspiracy against her life, and hinted that Mary was at the bottom of it,3 whilst Morton blew the flame by accounts of the hos tile activity of Lethington, the total desertion of Grange, and the warlike preparations of their op ponents.

This little army included the veteran com panies, called the old bands of Berwick,3 and had orders to advance to the capital, and avenge the death of the Regent upon the house of Hamilton. To Lennox no more grateful commission could be entrusted, and making all allowance for the re collection of ancient injuries it is difficult to regard the intensity of his vengeance without disgust.

In this expedition the palace of Hamilton, belonging to the Duke of Chastelherault, with his castles of Linlithgow and Kinneil, and the estates and houses of his kindred and partizans were so completely sacked and cast down, that this noble and powerful house was reduced to the very brink of ruin.4 Having achieved this, Lennox wrote in an elated tone to Cecil glorying in the flight of their ene mies, recommending the English to reduce Dum barton, and imploring Elizabeth to pity his poverty and send him more money.3 From Lethington the 1 MS.

In their mad attempts they had thought nothing less than that they might have carried off the ball alone, and have haled the devil without impediment, but he had thrown a stumbling-block in their way, and although they would fain make him odious in England, he trusted Leicester and Cecil would give as little heed to their aspersions as he did to their threats. Meanwhile he was still ready to unite with them in all good offices, and whatever happened would not be Lot's wife. As for Randolph, he feared, he had been but an evil instrument, and would never believe the queen could have followed the course she now adopted, if truly informed of the state of Scotland.\"1 These remonstrances of Lethington were repeated and enforced in England by the French Ambassa dor and the Bishop of Ross, and Elizabeth began to have misgivings that her severity would unite the whole country against her.

In the meanwhile Sussex was directed to correspond with Morton and his party. Ross repaired to Chatsworth to deliberate with his royal mistress, and her offers for an accom modation were carried into Scotland by Lord Liv ingston and John Beaton. The English army then retired, and Elizabeth assured both factions of her earnest desire for the common tranquillity.2 These transactions occupied a month, and led to no pacific result, a matter of little surprise to those who were assured of the hollowness of the profes sions on the side of the English Queen and Morton. The one had not the slightest intention of restor ing Mary ; the other deprecated such an event as absolute ruin; and having humbled his enemies, looked forward to a rich harvest of forfeiture and plunder. 1 MS.

HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. A correspondence between Sussex, the leader of the late cruel invasions, and Lethington was the only remarkable feature in the negotiations. The Eng lish earl had been a commissioner in the conferences at York ; he was familiar with the services of Mur ray, Lethington, and Morton, during their days of fellowship, and was selected by Elizabeth to re monstrate with Maitland on his desertion of his old friends. To his letters the secretary replied by some bitter remarks on his recent cruelties, and he exposed also the infamous conduct of the king's faction to their queen and their native country. Sussex answ*ered, that he would be glad to know how Lethington reconciled his doings at York, when he came forward and accused his sovereign of mur der, with this new zeal in her defence. \" Your lordship,\" said he, addressing the Scottish secre tary, \" must call to remembrance that your queen was by you and others, then of the faction of Scot land, and not by the queen my sovereign, nor by her knowledge or assent, brought to captivity, de prived of her royal estate, to which she was by God's ordinance born lawful inheretrix, condemn ed in parliament, her son crowned as lawful king, the late Earl of Murray appointed by parliament to be regent, and revoked from beyond the seas ; yourself held the place of secretary to that king and state ; and after she escaped from her capti vity, from the which the queen my sovereign had by all good means sought to deliver her, and had been the only means to save her life while she con-"], [359, "1570.

On the contrary, the country presented a miserable spectacle of intestine commo tion and private war, and it was in vain that all good men sighed and struggled for the restoration of order and tranquillity ; the king's authority wras de spised, the queen remained a captive, there was no regent to whom the poor could look for protection, every petty baron, even every private citizen, found himself compelled to follow a leader, and under the cessation of agriculture and national industry, the nation was rapidly sinking into a state of pitiable weakness and bankruptcy.

Morton and Lennox had despatched the Abbot of Dumfermling, to carry their offers to Elizabeth, and were thrown into deep anxiety by her doubtful replies.1 She had stimulated them to take arms, and now, as they had experienced on former occa sions, she appeared ready to abandon them, when to advance without her aid was impossible, and to recede would be absolute ruin. In this difficulty, a decided step was necessary, and they determined to raise Lennox to the re gency. It was a measure imperatively required, as the only means of giving union and vigour to their party, and as they acted with the advice of Randolph the English ambassador, they were well assured, that although Elizabeth affected neu trality for the moment, such a step would not be unacceptable to her. But in deference to her wishes for delay, they proceeded with caution.

Lethington was then in Athol. Huntly, whom Mary had invested with the office of her lieutenant-governor,3 remained at Aberdeen, concentrating the strength of the North, and the other lords who supported the queen's authority were busily employed arming their vassals in their various districts.

He refused to be present, would not even hear the letter of Elizabeth read by Randolph, and issued orders that no cannon should be fired aster the proclamation.1 Upon this Sussex told Cecil, that he had written \" roundly\" to him, but so little impression was made by his remonstrances, that the queen's lords declared their determination to hold a parliament at Linlithgow, on the 4th of August, and publicly avowed their resolution never to acknowledge Lennox as Regent.2 Both parties now prepared for war, and the new governor, aware that his only chance of success rested on the support of England, dispatched Nicho las Elphinston to urge the immediate advance of Sussex with his army, and the absolute necessity of having supplies both of money and troops. Without a thousand footmen, it would be impossible for him to make head, he said, against the enemy.

It was her policy that the two factions should exhaust each other, but that neither should be overwhelmed, and with this view she directed Sussex to ravage the West borders \" very secretly,\" and under the cloak of chastising her rebels the Dacres, who were har boured in these quarters.2 At the same time that she thus herself kept up the war, she publicly upbraided both parties with the ceaseless rancour of their hostilities, and with much apparent anx iety encouraged Lord Livingston and the Bishop of Ross, in negociating a treaty for Mary's resto ration. But whilst nothing but professions of peace and benevolence were on her lips, Scotland was doomed to feel the consequences of such cruel and ungenerous policy in a civil war of unex ampled exasperation and atrocity.

Eliza beth, before she restored her to liberty, having insisted on being put in possession of the castles of Edinburgh and Dumbarton, Mary, on the first men tion of such conditions by the Bishop of Ross, in dignantly declared, that the matter needed not an instant's consideration. Elizabeth might do to her what she pleased, but never should it be said, that she had brought into bondage that realm of which she was the natural princess.2 Sussex at the head of four thousand men, now burst into Annandale, and advanced in his deso lating progress to Dumfries.

This invasion was followed by an abstinence of two months, during which the negotiations for Mary's restoration were continued, but after re peated and protracted deliberations between the commissioners of Elizabeth, the Scottish Queen and the Regent, the issue demonstrated the hollow ness and insincerity of the whole transaction upon the part of the English Queen, and the faction 1 MS.

They had proposed to her the conditions of an accommodation, and after taking the advice of her commissioners, and communicating with the King of France and the Duke of Alva,1 whose an swers she received, she had declared her acquies cence. All matters appeared to be upon the eve of a speedy arrangement, and it only remained for the English and Scottish commissioners to have a final discussion, when new demands, to which it was impossible for the Scottish Queen to submit, were started by Elizabeth, and Morton for the first time declared, that his instructions were limited to a general authority to treat of the amity of the king doms, and that he and his colleagues had no power to receive their queen into Scotland, or to give up to Elizabeth the person of their infant sovereign.2 This declaration, Lesly, the Bishop of Ross, with a pardonable warmth characterised as an unworthy subterfuge, complained that his mistress had been deceived, and insisted that if there was any sin cerity upon the part of the English Queen, the treaty for the restoration of the queen of Scots might be terminated upon terms of perfect honour and safety.3 But the appeal was addressed to ears 1 Lesly's Negociations, Anderson, vol. hi., pp. 109, 120, 121, 122, 123. 2 Lesly's Negociations, Anderson, vol. hi., pp. 125, 127, 130, 131, 133. 3 Lesly's Negotiations, Anderson, vol. hi., pp. 134, 137, 139."], [370, "1570. 344 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. determined to be shut against it.

The English deputies in giving a final judgment, observed that as the representa tives of Mary and those of the king and the re gent could not come to an agreement, they con sidered their commission at an end, and must break off the negotiations.1 During all this time the regent, although pro fessing to observe the abstinence, continued a cruel persecution of his opponents, and determined to assemble a parliament in which he might let loose upon them all the vengeance of feudal forfeiture. Against this Elizabeth remonstrated, but in such measured and feeble terms that her interference produced little effect.2 It was not so, however, with Sussex, a cruel soldier, but a man of honour, who on hearing a report that a sentence of treason was about to pass upon Lethington, wrote this sharp letter to Randolph. \" Master Randolph.

The regent was branded by Huntly, the lieutenant for the queen, as a stranger and alien, a man sworn to the service of England, supported by foreign power, and dead to every honourable and patriotic feeling. Huntly and his friends, on the other hand, were attacked as traitors to the government, ene mies to religion, band-breakers, assassins of the late virtuous and godly regent, and associates in that infamous band for the murder of their sove reign, which many had seen and well remembered. They replied, that if they were guilty or cognizant of the murder, their opponents were not less so, and produced the band itself signed by Murray, the regent, amongst other names. It was answered, that this was not the true contract for the king's murder, which Lethington had abstracted, and 1 Copy of the time, St. P. Off. 8th Oct., 1570. Sussex to Ran dolph.

The disputes became public, and Randolph, who felt indignant at the attack upon his old friend, the regent Murray, addressed a remarkable letter to Cecil in his de fence. \" Divers,\" said he, \" since the death of the late regent, some to cover their own doings, (how wicked soever they have been) some to advance their own cause grounded upon never so much injustice and untruth, seek to make the late re gent odious to the world, spreading after his death such rumours of him as they think doth make most to their advantage towards their inno cency in crimes that they are burdened with, and would fain be thought guiltless of, which is not only daily done here among themselves, but spread so far abroad, as they think to find any man that will give credit either to their word or writing.\" He then continued, \" to name such as are yet here living most notoriously known to have been chief consenters to the king's death, I mind not, only I will say, that the universal bruit cometh upon three or four persons, which subscribed into a ' band,' promising to concur, and assist each other in doing the same. This band was kept in the castle in a httle coffer or desk, covered with green, and after the apprehension of the Scottish Queen at Carberry-hill, was taken out of the place where it lay by the laird of Liddington in presence of Mr. James Balfour, then clerk of the register, and keeper of the keys where the registers are."], [373, "1570.

He had bitterly deplored the loss of Murray, and, aware of Mary's appli cation for succour to the Courts of Spain and France, two powers connected, in his mind, with every thing that was corrupt and idolatrous, he denounced her intrigues in the pulpit, and inveighed against her as a murderer and an adultress, in his usual strain of passionate and personal invective. \" It has been objected against me,\" said he, \" that I have ceased to pray for my sovereign, and have used railing imprecations against her.

Notwith standing some assistance in arms and money from France and Spain,1 and the incessant exertions of Grange and Lethington to keep up the spirit of the queen's friends, it was evident that they were becoming exhausted under the long-protracted struggle ; and the capture of Dumbarton castle by the regent, which occurred at this time, gave a severe shock to their fortunes. This exploit for its extraordinary gallantry and success deserves notice. The castle, as is well known, is strongly situated on a precipitous rock, which rises abruptly from the Clyde, at the con fluence of the little river Leven with this noble \u00e6stuary. It was commanded by Lord Fleming, who, from the beginning of the war had kept it for the queen, and its importance was great, not only from its strength, which made many pronounce it impregnable, but because its situation on the Clyde rendered it at all times accessible to foreign ships, which brought supplies. Captain Crawford, of Jordanhill, to whom the attack was entrusted, had been long attached to the House of Lennox. He was the same person whose evidence was so important regarding the death of Darnley, and who asterw*ards accused Lething ton of participation in the murder, since which 1 History of James the Sext, pp. 62, 64."], [377, "1570. REGENCY OF LENNOX. 351 time he appears to have followed the profession of arms. In the enterprise he was assisted by Cun ningham, commmonly called the Laird of Drum whassel, one of the bravest and most skilful officers of his time, and he had been fortunate in securing the assistance of a man, named Robertson, who, having once been w*arder in the castle, knew every step upon the rock familiarly, and for a bribe con sented to betray it. With this man Crawford and his company marched from Glasgow after sunset. He had sent before him a few right horse, who prevented in telligence by stopping all passengers, and arrived about midnight at Dumbich, within a mile of the castle, where he was joined by Drumwhassel and Captain Hume, with a hundred men. Here he explained to the soldiers the hazardous service on which they were to be employed, provided them with ropes and scaling ladders, and ad vancing with silence and celerity, reached the rock, the summit of which was fortunately in volved in a heavy fog, whilst the bottom was clear. But on the first attempt all was likely to be lost. The ladders lost their hold, whilst the soldiers were upon them ; and had the garrison been on the alert the noise must inevitably have betrayed them. They listened, however, and all was still, again their ladders were fixed, and their steel hooks this time catching firmly in the cre vices ; they gained a small jutting out ledge, where an ash tree had struck its roots, which assisted them, as they fixed their ropes to its"], [378, "1570. 352 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. branches and thus speedily towed up both the ladders and the rest of their companions. They were still, however, far from their object. They had reached but the middle of the rock, day was breaking, and when for the second time they placed their ladders, an extraordinary impediment occurred. One of the soldiers in ascending was seized with a fit, in which he convulsively grasped the steps so firmly, that no one could either pass him or unloose his hold. But Crawford's presence of mind suggested a ready expedient ; he tied him to the ladder, turned it and easily ascended with the rest of his men. They were now at the bottom of the wall, where the footing was narrow and precarious, but once more fixing their ladders in the cope stone, Alexander Ramsay, Crawford's en sign, with two other soldiers, stole up, and though instantly discovered on the summit by the sentinel, who gave the alarm, leapt down and slew him, sus taining the attack of three of the guard till he was joined by Crawford and his soldiers. Their weight and struggles to surmount it, now brought down the old wall and afforded an open breach, through which they rushed in, shouting, a \" Darnley, a Darnley,\" Crawford's watch word, given evidently from affec tion for his unfortunate master, the late king. The garrison were panic struck, and did not attempt resistance ; Fleming the governor, from long fami liarity with the place, managed to escape down the face of an almost perpendicular cleft or gully in the rock, and passing through a postern, which opened"], [379, "1571. REGENCY OF LENNOX. 353 upon the Clyde, threw himself into a fishing boat and passed over to Argyleshire.1 In this exploit the assailants did not lose a man, and of the garrison only four soldiers were slain. In the Castle were taken prisoners, Hamilton, the Bishop of St. Andrew's, who was found with his mail shirt and steel cap on ;2 Verac, the French ambassador, Fleming of Boghall, and John Hall, an English gentleman, who had fled to Scotland after Dacre's rebellion. Lady Fleming, the wife of the governor, was also taken, and treated by the regent with great courtesy, permitted to go free, and to carry off with her her plate and fur niture ; but Hamilton, the primate, was instantly brought to trial for the murder of the king, and the late regent, condemned, hanged, and quar tered, without delay. Of his being not only cog nizant, but deeply implicated in both conspira cies, there seems little doubt,3 but the rapidity with which the legal proceedings were hurried over, and the feeling of personal vengeance which mingled with the solemn judgment of the law, caused many who were assured of his guilt to 1 Diurnal of Occurrents, p. 203.

The reformed clergy pointed to his fate as a judgment from heaven ; the people, who were aware of his corrupt life and profligate principles, rejoiced over it, and this distich was fixed to the gallows on which he suffered. \" Cresce diu felix arbor, semperque vireto Frondibus, qui nobis talia poma feras.\" The loss of Dumbarton was a severe shock to the Queen's cause. It gave a death blow to all hopes of foreign aid, and the regent, advanced to Edinburgh with the determination of holding a Parliament, collecting his whole force, and at once putting an end to the struggle.1 Grange, however, still held out the Castle, keeping the citizens of the capital who favoured the king's faction in constant terror, and affording a rallying point to the queen's friends. During the late abstinence, he had been guilty of many excesses, and on one occasion had broken the common prison, and rescued one of his soldiers who had stabbed a gentleman in the street. It was said, also, that he had carried off at the same time a woman, suspected of being cognizant of the late regent's murder. Upon hearing of the outrage, Ce cil, his old friend, recently created Lord Burghley, remonstrated in indignant terms, expressing his horror, that one in his high command, and who had in former years of their intimacy been a pro fessor of the Gospel, should be guilty of so flagrant 1 MS. Letter. St. P. Off. Regent to Cecil, (now Lord Burgh ley), 14th May, 1571, Leith."], [381, "1571. REGENCY OF LENNOX. 355 a contempt of its dictates. The concluding por tion of his letter is remarkable: \u2014 \" How you will allow my plainness,\" said he, \" I know not, but surely I should think myself guilty of blood, if I should not thoroughly mislike you ; and to this I must add, that I hear, but yet am loath to believe it, that your soldiers that broke the prison have not only taken out the murderer, your man, but a woman that was there detained as guilty of the lamentable death of the last good regent. \" Alas ! my lord, may this be true ? and with your help may it be conceived in thought that you, you, I mean, that was so dear to the regent, should favour his murderers in this sort. Surely, my lord, if this be true, there is provided by God some notable work of his justice to be showed upon you ; and yet I trust you are not so void of God's grace \u2014 and so for mine old friendship with you, and for the avoiding of the notable slander of God's word, I heartily wish it to be untrue. * * *. I pray you commend me to my Lord of Ledington, of whom I have heard such tilings as I dare not believe of him, and yet his deeds make me afraid of his well doing.\"1 This eloquent appeal of the English minister would have been well calculated to recall Grange to his duty, had he and Lethington not been aware that there were occasions when deeds of violence, and even assassination, did not excite, 1 Copy, St. P.

In the meantime Morton, Makgill, and the Ab bot of Dumfermlin returned from their negotia tions in England1 and on rejoining the Regent, it was determined to resume hostilities with vigour. Lennox issued a summons for the whole force of the realm to meet him at Linlithgow on the 19th of May, and Morton concentrated at Dalkeith the troops which were in regular service and pay.3 Grange on his part, was nothing intimidated. He had received money from Mary, who,* although in captivity, contrived to keep a secret intercourse with her supporters ; about the same time a sea sonable supply of a thousand crowns, with arms and ammunition, arrived from France.3 The duke joined him with three hundred horse and one hun dred hackbutters. Lord Herries and Lord Max well entered the capital with two hundred and forty horse, Farnyhirst soon followed them, and the castle \"was so strong in its garrison and its for tifications, that he regarded the motions of his op ponents with little anxiety. On the 9th of May Lennox and Morton having united their forces, encamped at Leith, and erected a small battery on a spot called the Dow Craig,4 above the Trinity Church, with the object of com manding the Canongate, a principal street of the city. Here, whilst the cannon of the castle opened 1 19th April. 2 Diurnal of Occurrents, p. 209. 3 Id. p. 211. * The Pigeons' Rock."], [383, "1571. REGENCY OF LENNOX. 357 upon them, they assembled to hold their parliament, which was numerously attended, and fulminated a sentence of forfeiture against Lethington, his bro ther Thomas Maitland, and others of the most ob noxious of their opponents. Having hurried through these proceedings, they broke up their assembly, and abandoned the siege, whilst Grange immediately held a rival parliament in the queen's name, and attacked his enemies with their own weapons.1 It is impossible to conceive a more miserable spectacle than that presented at this moment by the country and the capital\u2014 the country torn and desolated by the struggles of two exasperated fac tions, whose passions became every day more fierce and implacable, so that the very children fought under the name of king's and queen's men/ the capital in a state of siege, whilst the wretched citi zens placed between the fires of the castle and the camp of the Regent, were compelled to inter mit their peaceful labours, and either to serve mider the queen's banner, or to join Lennox, and have their property confiscated. Two hundred chose this last severe alternative, and fled to the camp at Leith, upon which Grange passionately deposed the provost and magistrates, and placed Car, of Farnyhirst, a fierce and powerful border chief, in the civic chair, with a council of his re tainers to act as bailies.3 1 Diurnal of Occurrents, p. 215.

Amid these transactions Sir William Drury, the marshall of Berwick, had been sent by Elizabeth to open negotiations with the leaders of the two factions, and if possible to bring about a paci fication. Such at least was the avowed object of his mission, but the court of England have been accused by Sir James Melvil of acting at this moment with great duplicity,1 the various ministers whom they sent into Scotland, if we may believe this writer, a man of character and intimately acquainted with the times and the actors, were instructed to widen rather than to heal the wounds of the country, and it is certain that Drury's conferences with Kirkaldy, Morton, and Len nox, were followed by fiercer struggles than be fore. Nor were English intrigue, and the jealous or selfish passions of the rival factions, the only causes of the continuance of this unhappy state of things. Fanaticism added her horrors to the war, and the reformed clergy by a refusal to pray for the queen, inflamed the resentment of her friends, and gave an example of rancour to the people. Knox, their great leader, had some time before declared his determination never to acknowledge her autho rity, and no longer to supplicate God for her wel fare.2 On the entry of his enemies the Hamiltons into the capital, he had been compelled to a pre- 1 Melvil's Memoirs, p. 240.

REGENCY OF LENNOX. 359 cipitate retreat,1 but his flight was followed by more resolute measures on the part of the Kirk and the clergy, an assembly being convoked some time after at Stirling, which confirmed his judgment and reiterated their refusal.2 Grange now determined to hold a parliament in Edinburgh, whilst the regent and the king's lords resolved to assemble the three estates in Stirling. On the queen's side sentences of forfeiture and trea son were pronounced against Lennox the regent, Morton, and Mar, the Lords Lindsay, Hay, Cath cart, Glammis, Ochiltree, Makgill Clerk Register, the Bishop of Orkney, and a long list of the king's faction, amounting nearly to two hundred persons.3 The assembly, however, which was only attended by two of the spiritual and three of the higher temporal lords, was scarcely entitled to the name of a parliament.* On the other hand their oppo nents, with a greater attendance of the nobility, and a more solemn state, met at Stirring. Here the young king, then an infant of five years, was invested in his royal robes, and carried from the palace to the par liament by his governor the Earl of Mar, where he read a speech which had been prepared for him.' 1 History of James the Sext, p. 75.

The doom of treason was then pronounced upon the Duke of Chastelherault, the Earl of Huntly, Sir William Kirkaldy of Grange, Lord Claud Hamil ton, the Abbot of Arbroath, Sir James Balfour, Robert, afterwards Sir Robert Melvil, and many others ; whilst it was determined to dispatch imme diately an embassy to Elizabeth for the purpose of concluding a more intimate alliance, and assuring her of their speedy triumph over the faction of the Scottish Queen.1 Before the parliament separated a slight circumstance occurred which was much talked of at the time. The little king, in a pause of the proceedings, turning to his governor asked him, what house they were sitting in ? On being answered that it was called the parliament house, he looked up to the roof, and pointing to a small aperture which his quick eye had detected, ob served, that there was a hole in that parliament. People smiled, but the superstitious declared that it augured disaster to the regent, whose death oc curred only five days after,2 in an enterprise which seemed likely at first to have brought the war on Grange's side to a fortunate and glorious conclusion. This able soldier, having learnt the insecurity with which the regent and his friends were quar tered at Stirling, concluded that it would not be difficult by a rapid night march to surprise the city.

Their force consisted of sixty mounted hackbutters and three hundred and forty border horse, and as Bell had been born in Stirling and knew every lane and alley, no better guide could have been chosen. This little force rode out of Edinburgh in the even ing of the third of September, some horsemen having been previously sent to the ferry and other parts between Stirling and the capital to arrest all pas sengers and prevent any information being carried there.1 They first took the road towards Peebles, and it was reported in the enemy's camp at Leith, that they meditated an attack upon Jedburgh. Favoured by the night, however, they wheeled off in the direction of Stirling, and having left their horses about a mile from that city, entered it on foot by a secret passage in the grey of the morning be fore the inhabitants were stirring. So complete was the surprise, that they occupied every street without difficulty,2 broke up the noblemen's houses, and in an incredibly short time took prisoners the Regent himself, the Earls of Morton, Glencairn, Argile, Cassillis, Eglinton, Montrose, and Buchan, with ** MS.

These were placed under a guard in their houses, and at this moment, had the borderers kept together, the victory was complete ; but the Liddesdale men went to the spoil, emptied the stables of their horses, broke up the merchants' booths, en cumbered themselves with booty, and dispersed in the lanes instead of watching the prisoners. It happened here, too, as is often the case in an action of this kind, that a few minutes are often invaluable. Morton, before he was taken, had blockaded his house, and refusing to surrender till it was set on fire, his resistance gave the towns men time to recover themselves. Mar, in the mean time, rushing from the castle with forty soldiers commenced a fire from an unfurnished lodging which still fronts the high-street, and drove Huntly and Buccleugh with their prisoners from the mar ket place to another quarter where they were as sailed by the citizens on all sides ; whilst Lennox, Morton, and the rest of the noblemen so lately cap tives snatched up such weapons as were at hand in the confusion and soon put their enemies to flight. In the midst of this confusion and struggle, captain Calder, rendered furious by the disappointment, de termined that the Regent at least should not escape, and coming up behind, shot him through the back ; Lennox had been made prisoner by Spens of Wor miston, and this brave and generous man perceiv ing Calder's cruel intention, threw himself between them, and received the same shot in his body, and"], [389, "1571. REGENCY OF LENNOX. 363 was then hacked to pieces by the soldiers, Len nox faintly imploring them to spare one who had risked his life in his defence. Calder afterwards confessed that he was instigated to this savage deed by Lord Claud Hamilton and Huntly, before they took the town, in revenge for the death of the Arch bishop of St. Andrew's, whose ignominious exe cution, the Hamiltons had sworn to visit to the uttermost upon the Regent. A swift vengeance, however, overtook his assassin, for he and Bell, the chief leader of the enterprise, having fallen into the hands of the enemy, were instantly executed \u2014 Bell being hanged, having first been put to the torture, and Calder broke upon the wheel.1 Buccleugh was taken, only nine of the Queen's party slain, and sixteen made prisoners.

It was certainly even with its half success, a daring exploit, and Grange, in a letter, written a few days after, whilst he deplored the fate of the Regent, could not re frain from some expressions of exultation \" In their parliament trine (said he) when all their lords, being twenty earls and lords spiritual and temporal were convened in their principal strength, wherein there were above two thousand men, three hundred of ours entered among them, were masters of the town, at least for the space of three hours,- might have slain the whole noblemen if they had pleased, and retired themselves in the end with a rich booty, and without any harm.\"1 The unfortunate Regent was able to keep his seat on horseback till he en tered the Castle of Stirling, but the first view of his wound convinced every one that it was mortal, and his own feelings telling him he had but a few hours to live, he begged the chief nobles to come to his bed-side. Here he recommended the young king, his grandson, to their affectionate care, re minded them that as he had been faithful to his office, and had sealed his services with his blood, so he trusted they would fill his place by a man that feared God and loved his country. For his servants, they knew he had been cut off before he could reward them, so he must leave their recompense to his friends \u2014 for himself, he would only ask their 1 MS. Letter, St. P. Off.

His competitors for the office were Argile, whom Morton had induced to join the king's faction, and Morton himself, who was sup ported by English influence ; but the majority de clared for Mar, whose character for honesty in these profligate times stood higher than that of any of the nobles.2 On his accession to the supreme power, Mar confidently hoped, that by a judicious mixture of vigour and conciliation, he should be able to reduce the opposite faction, and restore peace to the country ;3 but the difficulties he had to contend against were infinitely more complicated than he anticipated.

This daring and crafty man, who was the slave of ambition, knew well that his best chance of securing the supreme power lay in keeping up the commotions of the country, and in this perfidi ous effort he received rather countenance than op position from the government of England. So suc cessful were his efforts, that for some months after Mar's accession to the regency, and during the siege of the capital, the war assumed an aspect of unexampled ferocity. In the midst of all this misery, the supporters of the captive queen were generally successful. Mar had been compelled to abandon the siege of Edin burgh, and now sent an earnest petition for assist ance from Elizabeth.2 In the North, Adam Gordon of Auchendown, Huntly's brother, defeated the 1 MS.

Of the first he exhibited a striking instance at Brechin, where, after a total defeat given to the Earl of Buchan, he generously dismissed nearly two hundred prisoners, most of them gentlemen, with out ransom or exchange. Of his vengeance, a dreadful example was given in his burning the cas tle of Towie, with its unfortunate mistress the Lady Forbes, and her whole household, thirty-seven in number.2 In her husband's absence, she had un dertaken its defence, and too rashly defied him from the battlements. Such a combination as that exhibited by Gordon was no unfrequent produc tion in these dark and sanguinary times.2 Meanwhile, in England, was discovered a new intrigue of the Duke of Norfolk for his marriage with the Scottish Queen. This nobleman had been liberated from the Tower, under the most solemn promises, to forsake all intercourse with Mary; but his ambition overmastered both pru dence and honour, and he had again embarked deeply with the Bishop of Ross and other friends 1 History of James the Sext, p. 109, 113 inclusive. 2 History of James the Sext, pp. 97, 111.

It was not to be ex pected that the English Queen should again pardon so dangerous an attempt, and her animosity was roused to the highest pitch, when she discovered the skill with which the plot had been carried on ; its ramifications with her own Roman Catholic sub jects, its favourable reception by the Courts of France and Spain, and the undiminished spirit and enterprise of Mary. Norfolk was accordingly tried and executed, the Bishop of Ross sent to the Tower, and a determined resolution embraced and openly declared by Elizabeth, that henceforth she would forsake all thoughts of the Scottish Queen's restoration, and compel a universal obedience to the government of the king her son. To obtain this, however, she was unwilling to incur the expense of an army, or the risk of a defeat. And by her orders, Sir William Drury, the Mar shall of Berwick, and Lord Hunsdon, the gover nor, began a correspondence with Grange, with the object of bringing him to terms. Lord Burghley, also, after a silence of two years, sent a friendly message to Lethington, and the secretary seemed rejoiced that their intercourse was renewed. He lamented their interrupted friendship, expressed satisfaction that some seeds of love yet remained, and trusted they would still produce either flower or fruit. To go into all the history of these sad times, he said, or of his conduct in them, would be as tedious as to declare, \" Bellum Trojanum ab"], [395, "1571. REGENCY OF MAR. 369 Ovo.\" But this he would say, that since the be ginning of their acquaintance, he had reverenced him as a father, and followed his counsels as of the dearest friend he had. As to Drury's messages, the matters they had to treat of were such as re lated to honour, duty, and surety, no right subjects. They proposed, therefore, to send a special mes senger to the Queen's Majesty, to inform her par ticularly of their intentions, and, in return, ex pected that she would grant a commission, either to Drury or some other person, who should be empowered to conclude a treaty with them.1 This high tone appears to have disgusted Eliza beth ; Drury's letters led to no satisfactory result, and Lord Hunsdon after a tedious correspondence was equally unsuccessful. He was instructed to bring over the queen's faction either by negotiation or by force, but when Grange discovered that he had no commission from his royal mistress to bind her by any positive agreement he wisely rejected his offers, and as the force of which he talked did not appear to be forthcoming, totally disregarded his threats. There is, indeed, every reason to believe that Elizabeth's chief object at this moment in the negotiations with Mary's supporters was, to ascer tain their exact strength and the practicability of reducing the kingdom under the king's obedience.2 1 MS.

Meanwhile, owing to the season of the year, for winter was commencing, she' determined to delay all hostilities and permit the rival factions to ex haust each other, confident that her interest would not materially suffer by the delay. Nor were her hopes in this disappointed. For many miserable months Scotland presented a sight which might have drawn pity from the hardest heart, her sons en gaged in a furious and constant butchery of each other,1 every peaceful or useful art entirely at a stand, her agriculture, her commerce and ma nufactures neglected, nothing heard from one end of the country to the other but the clangour of arms and the roar of artillery, nothing seen but villages in flames, towns beleagured by armed men, women and children flying from the cottages where their fathers or husbands had been massacred, and even the pulpit and the altar surrounded by a steel clad congregation which listened tremblingly with their hands upon their weapons.

Women coming to market were seized and scourged, and as the punishment did not prevent repetition of the offence, one delin quent who ventured to retail her country produce, was barbarously hanged in her own village near the city.1 These are homely details, but they point to much intensity of national misery, and made so deep an impression, that the period, taking its name from Morton, was long after remembered as the days of the \" Douglas wars.\" When we consider the aggregate of human mi sery and guilt which such a state of things supposes, it is impossible to withhold our abhorrence at the cold-blooded policy which for its own ends could foster its continuance. Yet at this moment Elizabeth appears to have secured the services of Morton by a pension, and these services were wholly directed to oppose every effort made by the regent to restore peace to the country.2 His principle was never to sheath the sword till his enemies had uncondition ally surrendered, and the cause of the captive queen should be rendered utterly hopeless.

At this crisis Elizabeth, who looked with alarm upon the increasing strength of her opponents, pro posed an abstinence for two months, preparatory 1 MS. Letter, St. P. Off.

The negotiations were managed by Sir William Drury and the French ambassador De Croc, whose services, from the league recently entered into between France and England, were not so cordially given to the captive queen as on former occasions. It seems strange, that so able a statesman as Lethington, and one so intimately acquainted with the duplicity of the English Queen, should on this occasion have been prevailed upon to consent to a measure which ulti mately proved the ruin of his mistress's cause.1 But he and Grange had been branded by their oppo nents as men of blood, who had obstinately refused to give a breathing time to their bleeding and ex hausted country, and to confute the aspersion they agreed to the abstinence. It was signed on the 30th of July, and contained an express provision, that, as soon as might be, the Nobility and Estates of the realm should assemble to deliberate upon a general peace. On the same day the truce was proclaimed in the capital, amid the shouts and joy of the inhabitants, and the now harmless thun der of the ordnance of the castle.

Mar, the regent, was indeed sincere, but he was completely controlled by Mor ton. This ambitious man now ruled the council at his will ; he successfully thwarted every effort to as semble the Estates, or deliberate upon a general pa cification; and unfortunately for Scotland, a calamity occurred at this moment which struck all Europe with horror, and produced the most fatal effects upon any negotiations with which Mary and her support ers were connected.1 This was the massacre of St. Bartholomew, an event exhibiting in dreadful rea lity, the result of Popish principles and intrigue; and wirich, though applauded in those dark times, is now happily regarded alike by Romanists and Protestants with unmingied feelings of execration and disgust. Five hundred Protestant gentlemen and men of rank, and about ten thousand of inferior condition were butchered in cold blood, the greater part in the capital of France, where the king him self, it was reported, directed the assassins, look ing from the windows of his palace upon the miser able victims who fled from their assailants.2 In the provinces the same dreadful scenes were re peated, and when the news arrived in England, communicated by Walsingham, Elizabeth's ambas sador, at the court of Charles the IX., the sudden- 1 MS.

When Fenelon, the French ambassador, presented him self at the palace, he found the queen and the court clad in mourning. He wras received in si lence \u2014 the stillness of the grave, as he himself de scribed it, seemed to reign in the apartments ; the queen indeed endeavoured to preserve her equa nimity ; and although deeply sorrowful, received him without complaint, but the courtiers fixing their eyes on the ground refused to notice his greeting. Instead of a palace, he seemed to have entered a chamber of death, where men were met to mourn for their dearest friends.1 But sorrow and indignation were not the only, or even the strongest, feelings excited on this occasion in the breast of Elizabeth. She had in deed recently concluded a league with France ; yet this, though it restrained the outward violence, did not diminish the intensity of her feelings. Fears for her own life, and terror for the result of those dark plots, which she had already repeatedly de tected and severely punished, perpetually haunted her imagination, and shook even her strong and masculine mind. Of these conspiracies Mary was the centre ; she was engaged in a perpetual cor respondence with the court of Rome, with France, whose name could not now be uttered without calling up images of horror ; with Spain, where 1 Carte, vol. hi. p. 522. Lingard, vol. viii. pp. 113, 114."], [402, "376 1572. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. Philip and the Duke of Alva, men- hated by the Protestants, had recently lent her the most effec tual assistance, and what was more alarming to Elizabeth than all, the recent trial of Norfolk, and the confessions of the Bishop of Ross, now a pri soner in the Tower, had convinced her, that as long as the Scottish Queen remained in England, the minds of her Roman Catholic subjects would be kept in perpetual agitation ; that no permanent tranquillity could be reasonably expected, and that judging by the recent excesses in France, her own life might not be secure. It is impossible to blame such feelings or such conclusions. They were natural and inevitable ; but making every allowance for the fears of her council and her people, and the attachment of her great minister Burghley, we are scarcely prepared for the calmness with which the death of the Scot tish Queen was recommended by the House of Commons, and strongly urged by Cecil. Elizabeth, however, would not listen to their arguments, and at last peremptorily put an end to their consulta tions.1 She had already publicly declared, that there had been no sufficient evidence exhibited against Mary by those who accused her of the death of her husband ; and to bring her to trial in England, 1 The Enghsh Bishops, in answer to a question of Burghley's, had given it as their opinion, that Elizabeth might lawfully put Mary to death, and justified their sentence by reasons of Scripture taken from the Old Testament.

REGENCY OF MAR. 377 or to cause her to be publicly put to death without trial, would, she felt, be equally unjust and odious. She accordingly contented herself, aster the death of Norfolk, with sending Lord de la Ware, Sir R. Sadler, and Bromley her Solicitor-general, to inter rogate the Scottish Queen regarding her political connection with that unfortunate man, and to re monstrate against any continuation of her intrigues.1 On this occasion, Mary, although plunged in grief for the recent execution of the duke, was roused by the harshness of the messengers to a spirited vindication of her rights as a free princess. Some of the allegations she admitted, some she palliated, others she peremptorily denied, and the interview led, and was probably intended to lead, to no defi nite result. But if Elizabeth abandoned all thoughts of bringing her royal prisoner to a public trial, and putting her to death in England, it was only to em brace a more dark and secret expedient, and what she judged a surer mode of getting rid of her hated and dangerous prisoner. The plot was an extraor dinary one, and its details, upon which I now enter, are new to this part of our history.

When the dreadful news arrived from France, Burghley and Leicester pressed upon the English Queen the necessity of instant attention to her safety on the side of Scotland, and Mr. Henry Killigrew was selected to proceed thither.1 He was instructed to negociate both with Mar, the regent, and the opposite faction led by Le thington and Grange ; to exhort both sides to ob serve the late abstinence ; to give them the details of the late horrible massacre, expressing the queen's conviction that it was premeditated, and to implore them to be on their guard. Such was his public mission, but shortly before he set out, Killigrew was informed that a far greater matter was to be entrusted to his ma nagement, that it was to be conducted with the utmost secresy, and was known to none but Eli zabeth, Leicester, and Burghley.2 In an inter view with the queen herself, to which none were admitted but these two lords, he received his in structions, which remain drawn up by Cecil in his own hand.' It was explained to him, that it had 1 MS. Letter, St. P. Off. Copy, August, 1572.

This might indeed be done in England, but for some good respects, it was thought better that she should be sent to Scotland, and delivered to the regent and his party, \" to proceed with her by way of justice.\"1 To accomplish this must depend, it was said, upon his skilful manage ment. He must frame matters so that the offer must come from them, not from the English Queen. This would probably not be difficult, for they had already many times before, under the former re gents, made proposals of this nature. If such an offer were again made, he was now empowered to agree to it, but it must be upon the most solemn assurance, that she should be put to death without fail, and that neither England nor Scotland should be endangered by her hereafter ; for otherwise, it was added, to have her and to keep her, would be of all other ways the most dangerous.2 If, how ever, he could contrive it so that the regent, or Morton should secretly apply to some of the lords 1 Dr. Robertson notices the paper in Murdin, and severely condemns this proposal of Elizabeth. This eminent writer inter prets it, as if the Queen had desired the Scottish Regent to bring Mary to a public trial, and if condemnation followed, to execute her. It seems to me clear, however, that the words \" proceed with her way by way of justice,\" when taken with the context, can bear but one meaning, the same meaning in which Leices ter employs the phrase in his letter in the Appendix, that of ex ecuting her summarily and without delay. \u2014 See Dr. Lingard, vol. viii. p. 118. 2 Murdin, p. 224."], [406, "1572. 380 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. of the English Council, to have her given up, now was the best time ; only, it was repeated, it must be upon absolute surety, that she should receive what she deserved, and that no further peril could ever possibly occur, either by her escape, or by setting her up again. To make certain of this, hostages must be required by him, and those of the highest rank, that is to say, children or near kins folk of the regent and the Earl of Morton. Last of all, he was solemnly reminded that the queen's name must not appear in the transaction, and Elizabeth herself in dismissing him, bade him re member, that none but Leicester, Burghley, and himself, were privy to the great and delicate charge which was now laid upon him, adding a caution, that if it \" came forth,\" or was ever known, he must answer for it. To this Killigrew replied, \" that he would keep the secret as he would his rife,\" and immediately set out on his journey.1 On entering Scotland, his first visit was to Tan tallon, Morton's castle, where that nobleman was confined by sickness, but the ambassador received from him the strongest assurances of devotedness to the young king his sovereign, and to Elizabeth, whose interests he believed to be the same. Knox had returned again to Edinburgh, and the recent news of the massacre in France was producing the strongest excitement. On repairing to Stirling, 1 MS. Letter, St. P. Off.

So far all was fa vourable, but it was evident to Killigrew, that without additional forces, which he well knew Eli zabeth would be unwilling to send, the regent could never make himself master of the castle. These and similar particulars connected with his public mission, he communicated as he had been previously instructed, to the secretary of state, but his proceedings in the other great and secret matter touching Mary, were contained in letters addressed to Cecil and Leicester, jointly, and he appears to have lost no time in entering upon it. He informed them in a dispatch on the 19th of September, that he had already \" dealt with a fit instrument, and expected that the Regent and the Earl of Morton would soon break their minds unto him secretly.\" 2 The instrument thus selected to manage the secret and speedy execution of the unhappy 1 MS.

Mary was Mr. Nicholas Elphinston, a dependant of the late Regent Murray, and who from an ex pression of Killigrew, appears to have been on a former occasion employed in a similar negotiation. Matters, however, were not expedited with that rapidity which Burghley deemed necessary, and this minister, although assured by his agent that he could not for his rife make more speed than he had done, determined to urge him forward. For this purpose he addressed to him a letter jointly from himself and Leicester. In reading it as it still exists in the original draft in Cecil's hand, with its erasures and corrections, it is striking to remark the contrast between its cold and measured style, and the cruel purpose which it advocates. It was written from Windsor, and ran thus : \u2014 \" After our hearty commendations, we two have received your several letters directed to us, whereof the last came this last night, being of the 24th of September, and as we like well the comfort you give us of the towardness in the special matter com mitted to you, so we do greatly long to receive from you a further motion with some earnestness, and that both moved to you and prosecuted by them of valour, as we may look for assurance to have it take effect, for when all other ways come in con sideration, none appeareth more ready to be allowed here by the best, than that which you have in hand. Wherefore we earnestly require you to employ all your labours, to procure that it may"], [409, "1572.

The causes thereof we doubt not, but you can enlarge to them, if you see that they do not sufficiently foresee them. We suspend all our actions only upon this, and therefore you can do no greater service than to use speed. \" Your loving friends, \" W.

He had assured himself of Morton's cordial co-oper ation in the scheme for having Mary secretly execu ted, and according to the instructions received from his own court, he had availed himself of the deep and general horror occasioned by the late murders in France to excite animosity against the papists, and to convince all ranks, that without the most deter mined measures of defence, their lives and their reri- \u00bb MS.

The picture given of this extraordinary man by Killigrew, in a letter addressed to Cecil and Leicester, written on the 6th of October, in reply to theirs of the 29th of September, is very striking. \" I trust,\" said he, \" to satisfy Morton, and as for John Knox, that thing you may see by my dispatch to Mr. Secretary, is done, and doing daily ; the people in general, well bent to England, abhorring the fact in France, and fearing their tyranny. John Knox (lie continued) is now so feeble as scarce can he stand alone, or speak to be heard of any audi ence, yet doth he every Sunday cause himself to be carried to a place, where a certain number do hear him, and preacheth with the same vehemency and zeal that ever he did. He doth reverence your lordship much, and willed me once again to send you word, that he thanked God he had obtained at his hands, that the gospel of Jesus Christ is truly and simply preached through Scotland, which doth so comfort him, as now he desireth to be out of this miserable life.

He desired me to make his last commendations most humbly unto your lordship, and withall that, he prayed God to increase his strong spirit in you, saying, that there was never more need.\"1 It was no doubt by Knox's advice that proclama tion was made on the 3d of October for a convention of the \" professors of the true religion\" to consult upon the dangers resulting from the conspiracies of the Papists. To the sheet on which it was printed, there were added certain heads or articles, said to be extracts from the secret contract between the pope, the emperor, and the kings of Spain and Portugal, for the extirpation of the Protestant faith,2 and Kilh grew believed that all these preliminaries would pre pare the mind of the people for any extremities that might be used against their unhappy sovereign. Meanwhile his tool, the Abbot of Dumfermling was secretly trafficking with Morton and the Re gent, and so far succeeded, that on the 9th of Octo ber a conference on the proposed execution of Mary was held at Dalkeith, in Morton's bed cham ber, he being still confined by sickness. None were present but the Regent, Mar, and Kilhgrew, who immediately communicated the result to Cecil and Leicester in the following letter : \u00bb MS. Letter, Brit. Mus.

They told me, notwithstanding, the matter was dangerous, and might come so to pass, as they should draw war upon their heads, and in that case, or rather to stop that peril, they would desire her Majesty should enter in league defensive, comprehending therein the cause of religion also. \" We came (he continued) to nearer terms, to wit, that her Majesty should, for a certain time, pay the sum that her Highness bestoweth for the keep ing of her in England, to the preservation of this Crown, and take the protection of the young king.

The reason assigned was, that the Scottish Queen had only been condemned as worthy of deposition on the ground of her ac cession to the murder of her husband ; she had not yet been judged to die.1 This proposition met with no encouragement from the English envoy ; a clear proof that a secret and speedy death was the object desired by Elizabeth. The proposal was, as he hinted, an excuse to delay time, and to agree to it, would have been to act contrary to his instructions. The conclusion of his letter I must give in his own words : \u2014 \" Although there be, that do assure me that the regent hath, after a sort, moved this matter to nine of the best of their party, to wit, that it were fit to make a humble request to the Queen's Majesty, to have hither the cause of all their troubles, and to do, etc., who have consented to him, and that I am also borne in hand, that both he and the Earl of Morton do, by all dexterity, proceed in the furtherance thereof, yet can I not assure my self of any thing, because I see them so inconstant, so divided * * *. I am also told, that the hostages have been talked of, and that they shall be deli vered to our men upon the fields, and the matter dispatched within four hours, so as they shall not need to tarry long in our hands, but I like not their manner of dealing, and therefore leave it to 1 MS.

Measures were to be taken to have the sentence pronounced (if indeed any ceremony of a sentence was seriously contemplated) and the ex ecution hurried over with the utmost expedition and economy ; and the only cause of delay on the part of the regent and his brother earl, was the selfish wish of making the most profit of this cruel bargain. Four days after this, on the 13th of October, Kil ligrew sent another secret packet to Leicester and Burghley. He had again been at Dalkeith, and found not only Morton \" very hot and earnestly bent in the matter,\" but \" the two ministers\" equally eager in the business. From the cautious manner in which the English envoy wrote, the names of these two ministers are suppressed, and in such a case con jecture is unsatisfactory. We know that Mr. Ni cholas Elphinston, and Pitcairn, the Abbot of Dum fermling, were the instruments already employed by Morton and Killigrew, in this dark negotiation, 1 MS. Letter, Brit. Mus. Cahgula, C. hi. sol. 375, Killigrew to Burghley and Leicester, October 9th, 1572."], [416, "1572. 390 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. and it is possible that they are here meant. Two other facts also are certain, from a letter of the English envoy, the one that Cecil had enjoined him to avail himself of the co-operation of the Kirk in accomplishing the objects of bis negotia tion, the other that he had already consulted John Knox, who, even in \" extreme debility,\" and as he describes it, \" with one foot in the grave,\" was, in mind, as active as ever. From a letter already quoted, we have seen his convictions of Mary's guilt, and wishes for her execution, he may there fore have been one of the ministers to whom allu sion was made. But this is speculation ; and, after all, it might be argued, that from the words of Kil ligrew, the matter he spoke of to Knox was not the execution of Mary, as the former private interview may have solely related to the best method of exciting the people against France and the Romish faction in Scotland. However this may be, the English ambassador was informed by Morton, that if Mar showed coldness, or delayed to execute the matter, it should be done without him, and he added, that as he was Lieutenant-general of the whole kingdom on this side Tay, he had power to carry it into execution.1 He hinted, however, that if Elizabeth hoped to gain this great object, she must be more cordial in her support, and more generous in her advances. Her refusal to assist them and her 1 MS. Letter, Brit. Mus. Cahgula, C. hi. f. 376.

To this Kilhgrew shrewdly re plied, that if Morton could, at this moment, have given some good assurance, that Mary should be executed, or, as he expressed it in his dark lan guage, for the performance \" of the great matter\" then he might safely reckon on the Queen of England for the satisfying his desires: but he must recollect, that its accomplishment was the sole ground on which a defensive league between the two countries could be negociated. Without it \" a man could promise nothing.\"1 From the ambassador's next letter, however, any anticipated coldness or disinclination on the part of Mar appears to have entirely vanished. It was written from Stirling, and informed Burghley and Leicester, that the regent, after some general observations on the subject of the peace, began to speak, \" touching the great matter, wherein,\" said he, \" I found him very earnest.\" \" He had sent,\" he said, \" his resolute mind to the Lord Morton by the Abbot, and desired him (Kilhgrew) to write speedily to Burghley and Leicester, that they might further the same by all possible means, as the only salve for the cure of the great sores of the commonwealth.\" I perceive,\" added Kilh grew, \" that the regent's first coldness grew rather for want of skill how to compass so great a matter, than for lack of good will to execute the same. He desired me also to write unto your honours to 1 MS. Letter, Brit. Mus. Caligula, C. in, f. 376.

They stipulated that the queen of Eng land should take the young king their sovereign under her protection; they demanded a declara tion from the English parliament, that his rights should not be prejudged by any sentence or pro cess against his mother; they required that there should be a defensive league between England and Scotland : and that the Earls of Huntingdon, Bed ford, or Essex, accompanied with two or three thousand of her majesty's men of war, should assist at the execution. These troops were after wards to join the young king's forces in reducing the Castle of Edinburgh. This fortress, when re covered from the enemy, was to be dehvered to the regent, and all arrears then due to the Scottish forces were to be paid by England. 1 MS. Letter, St. P. Off.

With these conditions Killigrew was grievously disappointed. He instantly, however, sent them by Captain Arrington, a confidential messenger, to Burghley, accompanied by a letter, in which he mentioned Mar's extreme danger, but gave some little hope of life. At the moment, however, when this was written at Edinburgh, the regent had ex pired at Stirling, and Burghley received the ac count of his death, and the \" Articles of agree ment, touching the great matter\" almost at the same instant. Although commonly of a calm and collected temper, his agitation on the present occa sion seems to have been extreme. The articles them selves were such as he had little expected, the price of blood demanded by the Scottish earls was unreasonably high ; and he felt indignant at Killi grew, that he should ever have received such pro posals ; but even if it had not been so, the death of Mar rendered it impossible to carry them into ex ecution with the speed the necessity required ; and he immediately wrote to Leicester, informing him of the total failure of their Scottish project, and emphatically remarking, that the queen must now fall back upon her last resource for the safety of herself and her kingdom. What this was, he shrunk from stating in express words; but he knew that Leicester could supply them, and there is not the slightest doubt that he alluded to the ex ecution of Mary in England.

Mary in the meantime was herself unconscious of the danger she had escaped; and indeed it is worthy of observation, that so well had the English 1 MS. Letter, Brit. Mus.

During Morton's exile in England the Earl of Northumberland had been his kindest friend. Northumberland himself was now a captive in Scotland, under the charge of Morton \u2014 but in stead of a return of benefits, this base and avari cious man sold his unhappy prisoner to Elizabeth, who shortly after had him executed at York.2 1 Dr. Robertson, not having access to the St. P. Off. had not seen the letters of Killigrew and Burghley, which unveil this part of Mary's history. He consequently falls into the error of stating, that Mar, from his honorable feehngs, instantly rejected Kilhgrew's proposal of bringing Mary to her trial in Scot land, pronouncing her guilty, and executing her. AH subse quent historians, amongst the rest the acute and learned Lin gard, have been misled by this view of the transaction. Kilh grew's and Burghley's Letters have at length given us the truth. No trial, it appears to me, was ever contemplated \u2014 and Mar, though at first cold in the matter, at last, gave his full consent to Mary's being put to death as speedily and secretly as possible. 2 MS.

The death of Mar, over which there hung some suspicion of poison, threw Kilhgrew, the Enghsh ambassador, into much perplexity,1 and Burghley, who had received the news as early as the 3d of November, wrote on that day to Walsingham, the English ambassador at the French court, in much anxiety. \" The 29th Of the last,\" said he, \" the good regent of Scotland is dead, as I think by a natural sickness, and yet the certainty is not known.

God be merciful to us * *.'\" Elizabeth, who felt the importance of the event, and dreaded the success of French money and intrigues in Scotland, lost not a moment in taking measures to preserve her party. She wrote to the Countess of Mar, recommending her to watch over the safety of the young prince, her dear relative, in whose welfare she took the deepest interest, and she sent a flattering letter to the Earl of Mor ton, in which with unusual condescension, she ad dressed him as if already regent, calling him her well-beloved cousin, commending the wisdom with which he had governed himself in times past in seasons of great difficulty, and expressing her hope that he and the nobility would take measures for the safety of the young king, and the repose of the realm. For more particulars she referred him to Killigrew, her ambassador, and alluding to the necessity of appointing a new regent, trusted that the election would not disturb the quiet of the country.2 These were politic steps, as Morton was undoubt edly at this time the most able and powerful of the nobility. Even under Mar he had regulated every public measure, and when it was certain that the regent was on his death bed, the whole adminis tration of affairs seems naturally to have devolved i MS.

HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. on him.1 He was supported by the great majority of the nobles, by the influential party of the church, and by the friendship of England. Against such influence the Castilians and their friends could do little, and after a feeble opposition, he was chosen Regent in a parliament held at Edinburgh on the 24th of November, and proclaimed next day with the usual solemnity.2 At this parliament Elizabeth's letters to the Scot tish nobility were publicly read, and although these were not so decided in their language as her par tizans had desired, there can be little doubt that the knowledge of her favour to Morton produced the greatest influence. On informing his royal mistress and her minister Burghley of the late events, Killigrew earnestly advised some more effectual assistance to be sent to the new Regent. He had in vain endeavoured to induce the two factions to refer their controversies to Elizabeth. The Castilians were still confident in the strength of their fortress, and looked to speedy aid from France ; Morton on the other hand, although he admitted the desirableness of peace, had inva riably asserted, that to storm the castle and ut terly subdue the king's enemies would be the only means to establish a firm government, and restore 1 MS.

But it was evident that this could not be done without some effectual assistance. The regent and the nobles were too poor to maintain any sufficient body of troops on their own resources, and the danger seemed to be, that if not supported by Elizabeth, they would look to France. \" This regent,\" said Killigrew, in his letter to Burghley, \" is a shrewd fellow, and I fear little Douglas be not come home out of France without some offers to him among others, howbeit hitherto I can perceive nothing at all, for he assureth me still to run the course of England as much as ever regent did. Notwithstanding I see not how he can make war till the parliament be ended, tho he had aid of money, and that for two reasons. The one the parliament is appointed in this town, which cannot well be holden because of the castle if it were war, and the parliament must of necessity be holden for many weighty reasons. The other is the regent's indisposition, as he is not like to travel for a month or two, but rather to keep his bed or chamber under the surgeon's care for a disease that hath much troubled him this five or six years.\"1 A few days after the dispatch of this letter, Killi grew made a rapid journey to Berwick to hold a conference with Sir William Drury on Scottish matters, and obtain his advice and assistance. He was recalled suddenly, however, to Edinburgh, by 1 MS. Letter, St. P. Off. Killigrew to Burghley, Dec. 10th, 1572. Edin."], [426, "400 1572.

They reported, that with a proper force and battering trains it might be taken in twenty days, and it was resolved, as soon as the season of the year permitted, to begin the siege. It was in the midst of these transactions, and on the very day on which Morton was chosen regent, that the celebrated reformer Knox died, in his house at Edinburgh.2 He was scarcely to be called an aged man, not having completed his sixty-seventh year, but his life had been an inces sant scene of theological and political warfare, and his ardent and restless intellect had worn out a frame which at no period had been a strong one. There is perhaps no juster test of a great man, than the impression which he has left, or the changes he has wrought, upon his age, and under 1 MS. Letter, St. P. Off. B. C.

The history of his life is indeed little else than the history of this great religious revolution, and none can deny him the praise of courage, integrity, and indefatigable exertion in proclaiming that system of truth which he believed to be founded upon the word of God. To this he was faithful to the last, and although it appears to me, that on many occa sions he acted upon the principle, (so manifestly erroneous and anti- christian), that the end jus tified the means, on no one occasion do we find him influenced by selfish or venal motives. In this re spect he stands alone, and pre-eminent over all the men with whom he laboured. To extirpate a system which in its every part he believed to be false and idolatrous, and to replace it by another, of which he was as firmly persuaded that it was the work of God, seem to have been the master passion of his mind. In the accomplishment of this, none who has studied the history of the times, or Iris own writings, will deny, that he was often fierce, unrelenting, and unscrupulous, but he was also disinterested, upright, and sincere. He neither feared nor flattered the great; the pomp of the mitre or the revenues of the wealthiest dior cese, had no attractions in his eyes, and there can not be a doubt of his sincerity, when in his last message to his old and long-tried friend Lord Burghley, he assured him that he counted it higher VOL.

During his last illness, his time was wholly occupied in offices of devotion, and in receiving the visits of a few religious friends, who affec tionately assisted his family in the attendance which his feeble and helpless condition required. A few days before his death, he sent for Mr. David Lindsay, Mr. James Lawson, and the elders and deacons of the church,1 and raising himself in his bed, addressed them in these solemn words : \" The time is approaching for which I have long thirsted, wherein I shall be relieved of all cares, and be with my Saviour Christ for ever. And now God is my witness, whom I have served with my spirit, in the Gospel of his Son, that I have taught nothing but the true and solid doctrine of the Gospel, and that the end I proposed in all my preaching, was to instruct the ignorant, to confirm the weak, to comfort the consciences of those who were humbled under the sense of their sins, and bear down with the threatenings of God's judgments such as were proud and rebellious. I am not ignorant that many have blamed, and yet do blame, my too great rigour and severity, but God knows that in my heart I never hated the persons of those against whom I thundered God's judgments. I did only hate their sins, and laboured at all my power to 1 Bannatyne's Memorials, p. 264, 283."], [429, "1572. 403 REGENCY OF MORTON. gain them to Christ. That I forbore none of whatsoever condition, I did it out of the fear of my God, who had placed me in the function of the ministry, and I knew would bring me to an ac count. Now, brethren, for yourselves, I have no more to say, but that you take heed to the flock over whom God hath placed you overseers, and whom he hath redeemed by the blood of his only begotten son. And you, Mr. Lawson (this was his successor), fight a good fight. Do the work of the Lord with courage and with a willing mind, and God from above bless you and the church whereof you have the charge. Against it, so long as it con tinueth in the doctrine of truth, the gates of hell shall not prevail.\" * During his illness, he continued to exhibit all his wonted interest in public affairs, often bewailed the defection of Grange, one of his oldest friends, and sent a message to him which at the time was re garded as almost prophetic. \" Go,\" said he, ad dressing Lindsay the niinister of Leith, \" to yonder man in the castle, whom you know I have loved so dearly, and tell him that I have sent you yet once more to warn him, in the name of God, to leave that evil cause. * * * Neither the craggy rock in which he miserably confides, nor the carnal pru dence of that man (meaning the secretary Lething ton) whom he esteems a demi-god, nor the assist ance of strangers shall preserve him, but he shall > Spottiswood, p. 265, 266.

During this time his weakness rapidly increased, and on Friday the 21st of November he desired his coffin to be made. The succeeding Saturday and Sunday were spent by him almost uninterruptedly in meditation and prayer, in pious ejaculations, and earnest advices addressed to his family and friends. On Monday the 24th these sacred exercises were resumed till he was exhausted and fell into a slum ber from which he awoke to have the evening prayers read to him. \" About eleven o'clock (I use the words of his excellent biographer) he gave a deep sigh, and said, ' now, it is come,' upon which Richard Bannatyne, his faithful servant and secre tary, drew near, and desired him to think of those comfortable promises of our Saviour Christ which he had so often declared to others ; and perceiving that he was speechless, requested him to give them a sign that he heard them and died in peace. 1 Macrie'js Life, by Crichton, pp. 300, 302.

Upon this he lifted up one of his hands, and sigh ing twice, expired without a struggle.\"1 The death of Knox was followed by the complete recovery of Morton and the renewal of the war after a vain attempt to prolong the abstinence.2 But although hostilities re-commenced, a parlia ment assembled in the capital, the house where it met being protected from the fire of the castle by a bulwark, and in this, aster the election of the regent had been confirmed by the three estates, all mea sures adopted since the coronation of the young king were ratified, and every proceeding conducted in the name of the captive queen declared invalid and treasonable. Measures also were taken to urge forward a reconciliation between the regent and such of the nobility as had not yet acceded to his government. Of these the greatest were the Duke of Chastelherault, the whole of the Ha miltons, Argile, Huntly, and his gallant brother Sir Adam Gordon, who still maintained his ascen dancy in the north. With a view to facilitate an accommodation, it was secretly resolved that for the present no enquiry into the murder of the late king should take place, nor any prosecution be instituted against such persons as were suspected of this crime. The regent was also empowered to pardon all persons accessary to the death of the Earl of Lennox. 1 Macrie's Life, by Crichton, p. 309. Bannatyne, p. 289. 2 MS. Letter, St. P.

Mor ton himself, Huntly, Argile, and Sir James Bal four, (who had lately deserted his friends in the castle) were all of them concerned in the murder of Darnley, whilst the assassination of Lennox the late regent was as certainly the work of the Hamiltons. Any resolution to prosecute the perpetrators of either crime, must have at once put an end to the hopes of a reconciliation, and it was determined for the present to say and do nothing upon either subject.1 During the first sitting of the parliament Killi grew was absent at Berwick, whither he had gone for the purpose of consulting with Sir William Drury and expediting the preparations for the ap proaching siege of the castle. Before his departure, however, he had a meeting with Nicholas Elphin ston on the \" great matter,\" or to speak more plainly, the secret project for having Mary executed \u2014 a subject which, although interrupted by Mar's decease, appears to have been resumed on the election of Morton. It seemed, however, that this dark design of Elizabeth, by which she hoped to rid herself of her enemy without her hand ap pearing in the transaction, was invariably destined to be thwarted. We have just seen, that, for the security of Huntly, Argile, and the regent him self, it had been resolved to accuse no person of 1 MS. Letter, St. P. Off. 26th Jan. 1572-3.

REGENCY OF MORTON. 407 the murder, and the same prudent considerations made it expedient, at this moment, to say and do nothing against the queen. In a letter addressed at this time by Elphinston to Killigrew, this is clearly explained. \" The other matter,\" said he, \" I doubt not, you know perfectly well, cannot nor may not at this time be touched, because pre sently the murder may not be spoken of, seeing some suspected thereof to be in terms of appoint ment, as I shall at meeting cause you more clearly to understand ; but of this matter I trust hereafter shortly to see a good beginning.\"1 In this parliament a conference took place be tween the Kirk and certain commissioners ap pointed by the three estates, in which an important ecclesiastical measure was carried. This was the confirmation of that order for the election of bishops, which had been drawn up in the Book of Discipline devised at Leith many years before. The change amounted to nothing less than the establishment of episcopacy in the Scot tish Church. It was decided, that the title and office of Archbishop and Bishop should be conti nued as in the time which preceded the Reforma tion, and that a spiritual jurisdiction should be exercised by the bishops in their respective dio ceses. It was determined that all abbots, priors, and other inferior prelates who were presented to benefices should be tried by the bishop or superin- 1 MS. Letter, St.P.Off.N.

It was also ordered, that all bene fices with cure under prelacies, should be dis posed of to ministers who should receive ordina tion from the bishop of the diocese, upon their taking an oath to recognise the authority of the king, and to pay canonical obedience to their or dinary.1 In the midst of these proceedings Killigrew re turned to Edinburgh, and on the succeeding day was admitted to an audience of the parliament. The message which he delivered, and the as surances he conveyed of the determination of his royal mistress to protect the young king and sup port the government of the regent, produced an immediate effect, and a convention for a general pacification was soon after held at Perth, between commissioners appointed by the regent on the one 1 Spottiswood, p. 260, Mr. David Lindsay, a minister and commissioner, communi cated these important measures to Killigrew in a letter written during the sitting of the Conference, and when the guns of the castle were thundering in their ears.

It was attended by the English ambassador, in whose lodging the conferences took place, and who exerted himself so successfully to compose all subjects of difference, that at last a complete re conciliation was effected. \" And now,\" said the successful diplomatist to Lord Burghley, \" there remaineth but the castle to make the king uni versally obeyed, and this realm united, which per adventure may be done without force after the accord ; notwithstanding, in my simple opinion, which I submit unto your honour's wisdom, it standeth with more reason and policy for her Majesty to hasten the aid rather now than before this conference.

With this view the indefatigable Killigrew had hurried from Perth to the capital, where he obtained the regent's signature to the articles of pacification.3 Even, under all these gloomy appearances, the spirit of Grange was unbroken, and the resources of Lethington undiminished. A long experience of the parsimony of Elizabeth had persuaded them that she would never submit to the expence of sending an army and a battering train into Scot land. They looked with confidence to the arrival of assistance from France, and trusted that even 1 History of James the Sext, p. 127.

She dreaded bringing on a war with prance, re presented to her Council the great expence and hazard of the siege, and asserted that Morton ought to be able to reduce it without her assistance. Killigrew was in despair. He wrote instantly, that if the expedition were abandoned, Scotland would be lost to them, and as surely united in a league with France. Every thing, he contended, proved this. Lord Seaton had been already nego ciating with the regent to win him to France. What had been Verac's late commission? To corrupt the garrison of Dumbarton, to bribe the governors of the young king, and to convey him out of Scotland. What was Stephen Wilson's mes sage out of France, when he was lately seized, and his letters to the captain of the Castle of Edinburgh intercepted ?

And would her Majesty shut her eyes to all this, and this too at the very crisis when a decided effort, and no very great sum, might enable her to confound these plans and secure her ground in Scotland ? Would she countermand her army, and abandon the advan tages which were within her reach, or rather which she had already secured? \" If so,\" said the ambassador, in the end of an eloquent letter to Burghley, \" God's will be done.

They were joined *by seven hundred soldiers of the regent, and the battering train having at the same time arrived by sea, the opera tions of the siege commenced. In the midst of these martial transactions, the regent assembled a parliament, which confirmed the league with England, ratified the late pacifi cation, restored Huntly and Sir James Balfour to their estates and honours, and pronounced a sentence of treason and forfeiture against the Castilians. A summons of surrender was then sent to Grange in the name of Morton and of the English general,1 and operations for the undermining the \" Spur,\" or Blockhouse, and erecting the batteries on the principal spots which commanded the walls, pro ceeded with little interruption from the besieged.

This was in the evening, and a meeting immediately took place between Grange and Robert Melvil, on the part of the Castilians, Killigrew and Drury for the queen of England, and Lord Boyd for the re gent. Kirkaldy's requests were, to have surety for their lives and livings, not be spoiled of their goods within the castle, to have license for Lord Hume and Lethington to retire into England, and himself to be allowed to remain unmolested in his own country.2 To these conditions Drury would probably have 1 MS.

As to the great body of the garrison, he said, he was ready if they came out singly without arms, and submitted to Iris mercy, to grant them their lives, and permit them to go where they pleased ; but there were nine persons who must be excepted from these conditions, Grange himself, William Maitland of Lethington the secretary, Alexander Lord Hume, Robert Melvil of Mur docairny, the Bishop of Dunkeld, and the Lairds of Restalrig, Drylaw, and Pitadrow. These must submit themselves unconditionally, and their fate be determined by the queen of England, according to the treaty already made between her majesty and his sovereign.1 This stern reply made it evident to these unfor tunate men, that the Regent would be contented with nothing but their lives, and convinced of this they rejected his terms, and declared their resolu tion to abide the worst. But this was no longer in their power, for the soldiers began to mutiny, threatened to hang the Secretary over the walls within six hours if he did not advise a surrender, and were ready to deliver the captain and his companions to the enemy.2 In this dread dilemma an expedient was adopted, suggested probably by the fertile brain of Lethington.

They were accordingly carried to his quarters, and notwith standing some remonstrances upon the part of the regent, received with courtesy.1 Morton, however, was not thus to be baulked of his prey. He in stantly wrote to Burghley, warning him that the chief authors of all the mischief were now remain ing without condition in the hands of Elizabeth's ministers, intreating the queen's immediate decision upon their fate, and requesting them to be deli vered to him,* that they might suffer for their crimes.2 Killigrew, too, had the barbarity to advise their execution, and Drury anxiously awaited his next orders.

The success of Drury had fulfilled the first part, and the violence with which the ministers opposed every intercession for mercy, affords a melancholy proof of their determination that the second head of the reputed prophecy should be as punctually accomplished. Nor were they disappointed. On the 3rd of Au gust Sir William Kirkaldy and his brother were brought from Holyrood to the cross of Edinburgh, and executed in the presence of an immense con course of spectators. They were attended on the scaffold by Mr. David Lindsay, a martial clergy man of those times, to wiiose hands, if we may be lieve Melvil, it was difficult to say whether the bible or the hagbut were most congenial instru ments.

In England she had seen all her plans blasted by the death of Norfolk, and the im prisonment of the Bishop of Ross. To France she could no longer look for active interference in her behalf, for Elizabeth had recently entered into the defensive treaty of Blois, with that kingdom, and Catherine of Medicis was negociating a marriage between the English Queen, and her son, the Duke D'Alenc,on, a proposal hollow indeed, and insincere on both sides, yet, for the time, rendering all inter ference with Scotland on the part of France unad visable. Even Spain she could no longer regard with any confidence. The Duke of Alva was the friend and secret correspondent of Burghley and Elizabeth ; and although the Roman Catholic re fugees in Flanders were incessant in their intrigues, and Philip himself seemed disposed to annoy her on the side of Ireland and Scotland, the influence of this minister effectually counteracted any de cided enterprise.2 With the death of Kirkaldy, 1 Melvil's Memoirs, p. 257.

It has long been known, that some of the principal supporters of the Protestant cause in Scotland were imphcated in the as sassination of Riccio ; but it has hitherto been believed that their great ecclesiastical leader Knox was not privy to this murder. From the language, in which the event is told in his history it might be inferred, indeed, that he did not condemn the assassination of one whom he regarded as a bitter enemy to the truth.1 \" After this manner above specified,\" says he, \" to wit by the death of David Rizzio, the noblemen were reheved of then- trouble, and restored to their places and rowmes,2 and likewise the Church reformed, and all that professed the Evangel within this realm, after fasting and prayer were dehvered ;\" but in weighing this passage it is to be remembered, that although the Fifth Book of Knox's history was probably composed from notes and collections left by the re former, it was not written by him.3 The late Dr. Macrie, his excellent biographer, has this sentence upon the subject, which from the authority deservedly attached to his life of Knox may be taken as the present popular behef upon the point. \" There 1 Knox's History, p. 344. !

But it is probable that he had expressed his satisfaction at an event which contributed to the safety of religion and of the Commonwealth, if not also his ap probation of the conduct of the conspirators.\" * As Dr. Macrie had not the advantage of consulting those letters upon this subject which I have found in the State Paper Office, and by which the whole secret history of the conspiracy against Riccio has been developed, we are not to wonder that he should have spoken so decisively of Knox's innocence of any previous knowledge of the plot. I shall now state as clearly as I can, the evidence upon which I have affirmed in the text that he was precognizant of the intended murder \u2014 adding, at the same time, some letters which may be quoted in his defence. The reader is already aware that Riccio was assassinated on the 9th of March, 1565 6; that Ruthven, Morton, Lethington, fled on the queen's escape and meditated advance to Edinburgh (March 18th), and that while other accomphces secreted themselves in Scotland, Morton and Ruthven took refuge in England. Such being the state of things, on the 2 1 st of March the Earl of Bedford then at Berwick, of which he was governor, thus wrote to Cecil, \u2014 \" You shall understand that the Lord Ruthven is come hither for his own safety, who, passing thro Tiviotdale came to Wark Castle, and being troubled with sickness, and therefore weak, tar ried the longer upon the way thence, afore he came here.

Now that these two persons, the Earl of Bedford and Randolph were intimately ac quainted with the whole details of the conspiracy, has been proved in the text.2 To the proof there given I shall merely add part of a letter of Bedford to Cecil, written, it is to be observed, on the J 1 th of March, the unhappy man having been murdered on the evening of the 9th of March. \" After my hearty commendations \u2014 yesterday in the morning the Earl of Murray and the other lords, and the rest entered into Scotland, and went that night to Edinburgh * * These lords make account to find great aid in Scotland, so as shortly things will fall out in more open sort than as yet, whereof from time to time you shall be advertised * * Since the writing hitherto certain advertisement is come that David is dispatched and dead.

' \" The truth is,\" says Dr. Macrie, in his reflections upon the death of Beaton, \" he (Knox) held the opinion that persons who by the commission of flagrant crimes, had forfeited their hves, according to the law of God, and the just laws of society, such as notorious murderers, and tyrants, might warrantably be put to death by pri vate individuals, provided all redress in the ordinary course of jus tice was rendered impossible, in consequence of the offenders having usurped the executive authority, or being systematically protected by oppressive rulers.1\" Now, keeping this in mind, we find Morton and Ruthven, the leading conspirators, informing Cecil in a letter from Berwick, written on the 27th March, that the great end proposed by them in the murder of Riccio, was to prevent the universal subversion of religion within Scotland ; and they add this remarkable sentence, \" and to the execution of the said enterprise the most honest and most worthy were easily induced to approve, and fortify the king's dehberation in the premises, howbeit in action and manner of ex ecution, more were followed of the king's advice, kindled by an extreme choler, than ]we dehberated to have done.\" 2 Who then were these persons named here \" the most honest and most worthy? \" Evidently none else than the heads of the Protestant party, Mor ton and Ruthven, Lethington, Lindsay, and Ochiltree, the barons of Ormiston, Brunston, Calder, Hatton, Lochleven and others in Scotland, with Cecil, himself, and Bedford, and Randolph, the great supporters of the Protestant cause in England, And here it is to be noted that these barons of Ormiston, Brunston, Calder, and Hatton, were dear and intimate personal friends of Knox, whilst Ochiltree was his father-in-law. The re former also, as we have seen, was the confidential correspondent of Bedford and Cecil, the associate in the common cause for the support of religion with Morton and Lethington, and undoubtedly the most powerful and influential of all the ministers or leaders of the Kirk. If called upon, therefore, to beheve that the list which 1 Macrie's Life of Knox, with notes, by Dr. Crichton, p. 27. 2 MS. Letter, St. P. Off. 27 March, 1565.

This supposition seems to me, I confess, untenable ; and when I find Bedford and Ran dolph transmitting his name as one of the conspirators to Cecil, I cannot escape from giving credit to their assertion. Another corroboration of his accession to this conspiracy was his precipitate flight from Edinburgh with the rest of the conspira tors, upon the threatened advance of the queen to the city. His colleague Craig, it is to be observed, who was afterwards ac cused by his parishioners as having been too much a favourer of the queen, remained in the city ; but Knox fled precipitately, and in extreme agony of spirit to Kyle, and as we have already seen, did not venture to return till the noblemen rose against the queen after the death of Darnley.2 If he was not imphcated, why did he take guilt to himself by flight ? There is a passage to be found in the manuscript history of Calderwood, which is worth noticing upon this point. It has been quoted by Dr. Macrie,3 and is as follows, \" King James the VI. having found great fault with Knox for approving of the assassination of Riccio, one of the ministers said, that the slaughter of David, as far as it was the work of God was allowed by Mr. Knox, and not otherwise,\" Calderwood, MS. ad annum 1591. \" Knox himself,\" adds Dr. Macrie, \" does not make this quali- 1 Dr. Macrie, in noticing Knox's flight from Edinburgh, after the murder, states, that \" it is probable he had expressed his satisfaction at an event which contributed to the safety of religion and the commonwealth, if not also his ap probation of the conduct of the conspirators.''

It is lastly to be remembered, that Riccio was a Roman Catholic, consequently in Knox's eyes an Idolater ; and that the reformer and his party held that Idolatry might justly be punishable by death. \" Into this sentiment they were led,\" says Dr. Macrie, \" in consequence of their having adopted the untenable opinion, that the judicial laws given to the Jewish nation were binding upon Christian nations, as to ah offences against the moral law.\"1 Such is the evidence which appears to me conclusive in sup port of the fact stated in the text. Let me now mention two cir cumstances which may be quoted in defence of Knox, and hi proof of his innocence of this charge. The first hst, including Knox's name as one privy to Riccio' s death, is, as we have seen, preserved in the State Paper Office, attached to a letter, dated 21st March. But there is another hst in the British Museum, dated the 27th of March, which does not include the reformer's name, or that of Craig his col league. It is in the handwriting of Randolph, and is entitled, \" The names of such as were doers, and of council, in the late attempt for the killing of the secretary David at Edinburgh, 9th March, 1566, as contained in the account sent to the council of England, by the Earl of Bedford, Lieutenant of the North, and Sir Thomas Randolph, ambassador from England to Scotland at the time, dated at Berwick, 27th March, 1566.\" This account or letter of the 27th of March has been printed from the original in the Cotton collection,2 by Sir Henry Ellis, vol. h. p. 207, along with the hst of the names. The second circumstance is this \u2014 when Morton and Ruthven fled to Berwick, and sent to Bedford a vindication of their pro ceedings with the intent that he should communicate it to Cecil and Elizabeth, they positively denied that any of the ministers of Scotland were art and part in the conspiracy, and accused the Papists of having raised the report. \" It is come to our know- 2 Caligula, B. X. sol. 337. 1 Macrie's Life of Knox, p. 246. 2 f 2"], [462, "436 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. ledge (they say) that some Papists have bruited that these our pro ceedings have been at the instigation of the ministers of Scotland. We assure your lordship upon our honour,- that there were none of them art nor part of that deed, nor were participate thereof.\"1 And now it may be asked, why do you reject the evidence of this second hst, and why are we not to beheve this solemn decla- ration absolving the ministers of Scotland, and of course Knox with them, from all participation in the murder. To this I an- swer, that there is no evidence to raise doubt that the hst given on the 2 1 st March was written in good faith, while the event was yet new, after the arrival of Lord Ruthven, and without any object but that of transmitting information to Cecil, while that of the 27th March sent to the council of England, was carefully prepared after the failure of the conspiracy by the escape of the queen, and when the cautious and pohtic Morton had reached Ber- wick ; that these lords would have an especical object in keeping the names of Knox and Craig out of the hst is evidenced by the above extract, and that they would have httle scruple to such a suppres sion is clear from the manner in which they submit their narrative to Cecil, to be amended and qualified at his pleasure. That the Secretary of Ehzabeth did modify and recast the story after the failure of the conspiracy, and with the approbation, or by the directions of Ehzabeth, is expressly asserted by one who appears to have had an intimate acquaintance with the whole plot against Riccio. \" La Regina d'Inghilterra,\" says, he, \" quale era stata causa del tutto, intendendo la pace fra il Re e Regina di Scotia, s'attristo molto e fece scrivere per il suo Secretario Cecille, per tutto il regno, che la causa di tutto il suddetto, era perche il Re haveva trovato il detto Ricciolo a dormire con la Regina. II che non fu mai vero.2 The extent to which this modification and alteration was not only permitted, but invited, to be carried, may be ga thered from a passage in a letter of Morton and Ruthven to Secre tary Cecil, sending him their account of the conspiracy and mur- 1 Harleian, No. 289, sol. 96.

I answer, because ac cording to Morton's notions, being art and part, or participate in any action or crime, was a totally different thing from being privy to it, or cognizant of it before it was committed. Morton, accord ing to the distinction which he made on his own trial, might have asserted with perfect honour, that neither Knox nor any of the ministers were participate in Riccio' s murder, and yet he may have been perfectly aware that Knox was privy to the murder, knew that it was about to be committed, and according to the expression used to the king by one of their number, allowed of it, that is, gave a silent consent to it, so far as he considered it to be the work of God, for the destruction of an enemy of the truth 1 MS.

History, p. 83. I have stated the fact of the king having been strangled, and have added some new particulars regarding the murder, not only on the authority of a letter of Drury to Cecil, but from what I consider a still more unexceptionable piece of evidence, the assertion of Morett, the Savoy ambassador, who was on the spot, and had an opportunity of making himself acquainted with ah the circumstances. As this point has been controverted, and some obscurity still hangs over the mode in which the murder was completed, I am happy to be able to publish the following curious and authentic extract from a letter dated at Paris, 16th March, 1567. It forms part of the coUections of Prince La banoff the original being amongst the Medici papers, to which the prince had access.

There was at the meeting at Dunkeld the Earls Murray, Morton, Athol, and Caithness, the L. Oglebie, the L. Glamis, Lindsay, and others. John Hepburn, sometime Captain under the Earl Bodwell of the Harmitage, is thought to be one of the executors of this cruel enterprise, there is one Hughe Leader also suspected. I am promised to understand the certainty. His servant Sandy Duram, a Scotish man, is thought also to know some part. I will not write of so much as the Scots speak themselves, and some of them of credit. Standen and Nelson, with some others that served the Lord Darnley, as I hear, are referred for their wages to the Provost of Edinburgh. The Lord of Craigmillar, and the Earl Bod well, hath promised to give Standen a horse. Hudson, a man of good years, with the rest of the musitianers, came this other day to Seton, to the queen, and required her hcense that they might repair into their country. She dissuaded them to the con trary, saying unto them, you have lost a good master, but if you will tarry you shall find me not only a good mistress, but a mother. But they mind again to move her, and as I hear, minds to return. There is with her at Seton, Argile, Huntly, Bodwell, and Livingston, the Lord Seton is gone to Newbottle, having left the whole house to the queen, so she is there of her own provi sion, and minds, as I am advertised, to tarry there till near unto Easter. There is in hand to have the lords assemble in Edinburgh. She hath twice sent for the Earl of Murray, who stayeth himself by my ladie in her sickness. It is said that the Lord Fleming shaU be the Earl BodweU's deputy at An wick, for suppression of the rebels of Liddesdale, and that certain of the soldiers are gone from Edinburgh to the Harmitage there to remain. There was a rich ship of Shetland, bound to Flanders, lost this last week at Holy Island, receiving a leak, coming from Lieth. She was laden with fells, hides, and leaden ore.

Edward Colhngwood, one of this garrison horsemen, is returned from the Earl Bodwell, having remained with him in Scotland this quarter of this year. I have upon respects committed him to ward : by my next letters your honour shah understand more. The gates of Seton are very straitly kept. Captain Cullen, with his company have the credit nearest her person. The Earl of Bodwell, was on Thursday at Edinburgh, where he openly declared, affirming the same by his oath, that if he knew who were the setters up of the bills and writings, he would wash his hands in their blood. His followers, who are to the number of fifty, follow him very near. Their gesture, as his, is of the people much noted. They seem to go near and about him, as though there were that would harm him, and his hand as he talks with any that is not assured unto him, upon his dagger, with a strange countenance as the beholders of him thinks. Even as the L. Darnley, and his servant William Taylor, lay in the house in distance one from the other, even so, as also otherwise1, were they found together. Signior Francis, as I hear, minds to pass this way within six or eight days. I send your Lordship here the copy of some of the Bills set up, whereby you may see how undutifully the doers of the same doth behave themselves against their Sovereign. I have thought it my part as well to send to you this, as I have done in the rest, for that I would if you should so think it meet, that her majesty, my Sovereign, should understand all that comes to my knowledge of the proceedings in these parts. The Lady Bodwell is, I am by divers means informed, extremely sick, and not likely to hve. They will say there, she is marvellously swollen. \u2014 Even now is brought me that the Queen came upon Wednesday at night to the Lord Whawtons2 house, seven miles off this side, dined by the way at a place called Tranent, belonging to the L. Seton, where he and the Earl of Huntly paid for the dinner, the Queen and the Earl Bodwell having, at a match of shooting, won the same of them. There is a proclamation made in Edinburgh, forbidding all persons for raising up any of the stones or timber at the house 1 Sic. in Orig.

Then, said he, ye shall be soon discharged, and so returning into the Court, desired the said person to keep him company at the gate which he did, and therewith espieng a Scottish man, whom he had for his guide, took occasion to reprehend and threaten him of hanging, for bringing Enghsh villains as sought to and procured the stay of the Assize, with words of more reproach. \" In this instant Ledington was coming out and Bodwell with him, at the which all the lords and gentlemen mounted on horse back, till that Ledington came to him demanding him [of] the letter, which he delivered ; then Bodwell and he returned to the Queen, and stayed there within, half an hour, the whole troop of lords and gentlemen still on horseback, attending for his coming. Ledington seemed willing till have passed by the Provost without any speech ; but he pressed towards him and asked him if the Queen's majesty had perused the letter, and what service it would please her majesty to command him back again. \" He answered, that as yet the Queen was sleeping, and therefore had not dehvered the letters, and thought that there would not be any meet time for it till after the assize, wherefore he willed him to attend, so giving place to the (throng) of people that passed, which was great ; and by the estimation of men of good judgment above 4000 gentlemen besides others.

The assize began between x and xi, and ended vii in the afternoon. \"The Earl of Argile and Huntly, [were] chief judges ; what par ticularly was done or said there, I cannot yet learn, more than that there were two advocates called Crawford and Cunningham, for the Earl of Lennox, who- accused the Earl Bodwell for the murder of the king, alleging certain documents for the same, and desiring forty days term longer, for the more perfect and readier collection of his proofs.\" There is another original letter of Drury's written about this time, which is a fragment, and without the date of month or day. .It consists of disjointed pieces of news sent from Scotland by some one of those many spies, from whom Drury received information, \" The guard,\" says he, \" of the soldiers of Bodwell, he going to be triedby theassize, and their keepingof the door is much mishked of.\" \" Bothwell immediately after the trial set up a cartel of defiance ; he would fight any one (except a defamed person) who accused him of the king's death. If I thought it might stand with the queen my Sovereign her favor, I would answer it and commit the sequel to God, I have for me sufficient to charge him with, and would prove it upon his body, as willingly as I would receive the obtaining of my sute, required of the queen's majesty. I have here caused the draught of a letter to her majesty humbly craving your honor's judgment of it. The marriage of the queen to Bodwell, and the death of the prince is presently looked for. I send you here inclosed the ploughman's bill, if your honor shall think it good to show it to her majesty. There is another worse which I am promised*. \" The Cardinal did send a very gentle letter to the Lord of Mur ray by Clarenock, also credit by mouth, craving pardon for the past, for that he had born him evil will, but now finding that though his rehgion were contrary to his, yet his honest, honour able doings, and the care that he was now surely persuaded he hath tofore had of this queen here, and his sound deahng with her, ever, moved him now to think himself beholden unto him. Monsieur de Croc seems much to mislike the earl's departure, and says so to the queen. She answered, he went away for debt, but"], [480, "454 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. she wept at his departure, wishing he were not so precise in reh gion. She wished bim to go to Flanders, and to visit neither England nor France. \" It was Captain CuUen's persuasion, for more surety, to have the king strangled, and not only to trust to the train of powder, affirming he had known many so saved. Sir Andro Carr, with others, was on horseback near unto the place, for aid to the cruel enterprise if need had been. The Lady Coldingham, now wife to the young Mr. of Caithness, and sister to the Earl Bodwell, is in credit, and in the place of the Lady Renes, now out of court. Suspicion banished the one and placed the other. I dare not say, as others that knows more says. \" Great means was used to have had the Earl of Murray staid in the town till the cruel deed had been done. The Bishop of Glasco, Ambassador for Scotland in France, hath written to the queen, and to others which the queen hath understanding off, that nothing likes her of the death of the king. * * The king was long of dying, and to his strength made debate for his life. The Lord David, son to the duke, is mad, and Arbroath, his brother, hath already had a show of the same disease. * * There accompanied the Earl of Murray to the boundary, his brother the Lord of Holyrood-house, the Lord Hume, and the chief of the gentlemen of the March, and some of Lothian, as Brymstone and others. The king would often read and sing the 55th Psalm, and went over it a few hours before his death. There were not many that he would of his griefs deal with, but to some he would say he should be slain, and complain him much of his being hardly dealt with. Even now by the under-marshall I received this more. His own evil handling. He only kept out of the court, pushed out as it were by force, thrust upon the breast with extremity, in the sight of divers gentlemen, which seemed much to mislike therewith. \" A bill set up, ' Farewell gentyll Henry, but a vengeance of Mary.' The Queen sent a token and message to Bodwell being at the assise.1 The Queen upon Thursday last, past through the street unto the market, where there were women sitting that had 1 By Drury to Cecil, Border Corr. 24th April, 1567,"], [481, "455 PROOFS AND ILLUSTRATIONS. to sell. They rysse as she came near, crying aloud, ' God save your grace, if you be sakeless of the king's deade (of the king's death),' The queen's advocates, that should have inveighed against Bodwell, are much condemned for their silence. The hke at an assize hath not been used. * * Bodwell rode upon the courser that was the king's, when he rode to the assize. The nobility long tarried his coming a horseback, to accompany him. There was that followed him above ihi thousand, whereof the greatest part were gentlemen, besides they that were [in] the streets, which were more in number. The streets were full from the Canongate to the Castle. \" Ledington and others told the Under-Marshall, that the queen was asleep when he himself saw her looking out at a window, showed him by one of La Croke's servants, a Frenchman, andLed ingtou's wife with her, and Bodwell after he was a horseback looked up, and she gave him a friendly nod for a farewell ; for till it was known the Under-marshall' s errand as the contents of the letter, he had liberty in court, but not after, when he was once out, suffered to go in again.\" VI. \u2022 Mary's Marriage with Bothwell.

The Company of the Lords was esteemed to be four thousand. The Hamiltons had the vaunt garde of the Queen's part as sisted with others to the number of two thousand. Both compa nies did strive for a Hill nigh adjoining where they met. Their meeting together was in a strait passage thro a village. The Lord Hume, the Lord Semple, and the Lord Morton, had the vauntgard on that side. The fight endured at the least three quarters of an hour without giving back. The Queen's party first gave way, and then pursued1 . at the beginning of which chase Th' Earl of Murray willed and required all his to spare for shedding of more blood. Otherwise as many as were on foot which were the greatest number, had been in their Enemys will, for the h . whereof the lord Haris was general, fled and . , . within the horses of them that were hghted of the Company. The Queen beheld this Conflict within half a mile distant, standing upon a hill accompanied with Lord Boyd, the Lord Flem ing, and the Lord Harris son, with thirty others, who seeing the Company overthrown took the way to 2Dumbarton who was so near pursued that she could not take the boat that should bring her into Dumbarton, but was driven to take the way to Dumfries, where she as yet remaineth.

I could but promise her Majesty it should be to me as my life, which I trust I have kept, insomuch that when I was advertised that my Lord Keeper, after his coming to the Court, was also made acquainted with the matter, I durst never direct my letters to him, with your Lordships, but thought best to leave the same to your wisdoms.

Where upon I remember the abbot rephed, alleging certain causes why he thought her Majesty would never agree to any such thing, therefore that this was a mean to feel your Lordships' judgments, which saying of his I did insert as near as I could remember them in the letter, and after the ' Articles.' \" I humbly beseech your honours to consider that this was done at such time as the late Regent lay a dying, which matter and the"], [495, "PROOFS AND ILLUSTRATIONS. 469 sequel thereof did so occupy my head and hand, that I was shin to send those Articles with a confused letter, as it were rather to let your honours see the manner of their deahng (whereof I had given warning before in my other letters), than that I did allow or like of them, and therefore I advertised your honours how I had told my Lord of Morton plainly, that I had not sent them, but only received them of the abbot (who was gone over the water), to know whether they were as his Lord ship meant them \u2014 who, taking the copy which I had in my hand to- show him, after he had read them said, that the abbot had missed in something, and desired me not to send the Arti cles.
