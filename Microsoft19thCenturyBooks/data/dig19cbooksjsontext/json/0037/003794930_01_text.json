No book, it seems, is considered complete without an introduction, and an introduction, accord ingly, we thought it our duty to prefix to this volume. There are, we found, after going into the matter somewhat carefully, two ways of setting about it. The first is to get somebody to write your introduction ; the other is to write it yourself. The first system has great advantages, the most obvious of which is that it saves trouble ; then the friend who has undertaken to introduce you and your work to the public thinks it incumbent upon him, as a matter of course, to lavish praises on you, and to prove, by a number of facts and arguments scientifically marshalled, that from your birth, your education, your antecedents, and your family history you were destined to accomplish certain things in the world, one of which, and by no means the least important, was the work \" which it is now our pleasure and duty to commend to the attention of the reader,\" &c, &c. The drawback to this mode of proceeding is that some day you have to return the compli ment and write an introduction to your friend's literary efforts, and tliat you take a good deal more trouble over his introduction than you would on your own. The second system has the considerable merit of enabling you to blow your own trumpet in the way best calculated to satisfy your own vanity, if only you are clever enough to man age the thing with sufficient skill and adroitness. But it is not given to everybody to succeed in that kind of thing, and we would fain have found a friend to introduce us, for our indo lence is much greater than our love of fame. And we set about looking for a suitable literary friend, for, of course, this is a case of \" First catch your hare.\" We soon discovered that to catch a hare having the requisite qualifications is no easy thing to accomplish in September, that is to say, in the height of the holiday season, when everybody is out of Paris or London, enjoying the last fine days at the seaside, on the moors, on the Alps or in Norway, thinking a great deal more about shrimps, grouse, Alpine flowers, and salmon, than about introductions to the vagaries of an artist and a scribe. All efforts on our part to find a friend to write our introduction having proved fruitless, it became the duty of the scribe to bestir himself and set about writing one. In order to accomplish his task, he proceeded to peruse a number of books in the hope of finding a model for his introduction, which it was his design to prepare on the most approved and modern principles. In a very short time he perceived that introductions vary in a manner"], [16, "INTRODUCTION. X of which he had not hitherto had the faintest notion, and that each author or author's friend has, for that kind of literary composition, a style peculiarly his own. Well, but which was the best ? To this perplexing question, the artist and the scribe tried to find a proper aud correct answer, but the more they tried the more their doubts increased. For there are intro ductions laudatory, deprecatory, earnest, serious, comic, philosophic, and how many more besides it would be impossible to say, and none of these various styles quite suited us, or rather, when it seemed to become one of us it did not suit the other. Furthermore, in what capacity were we to make our bow to the public ? Of course, this being the record of a trip to England and \"Wales, we had half a mind to pose as explorers. But unfortunately we could hardly pretend to have discovered the British Isles ; it had been done before, a very long time before we ever thought of crossing the Channel. The suggestion was rejected as soon as made, and it was decided to state simply that some time ago the artist and the scribe, having agreed to take a trip to England, drew up an itinerary which was strictly followed, and an account of which, in pen and pencil, is here submitted. If we made a plan as to the route to be followed, we made none as to the subjects to be included in our survey, either from the artist's or the scribe's point of view. We came with perfectly open minds, to be guided only by the impression of the moment and with no preconceived idea. This is why we may often be found praising one day what we condemn the next. Fine weather, a comfortable hotel, pleasant company, a good dinner may, and in many instances, have induced us to find delightful a very commonplace town or unpicturesque spot, whilst under different conditions a fine city or a beautiful land scape may have been voted perfectly hideous by both of us. We did not attempt to be logical or systematic, and set to work \u2014 if work it be to enjoy a holiday and record one's impressions \u2014 in a free-and-easy, happy-go-lucky sort of way, without in any way troubling ourselves as to the contradictory opinions we may express at different times on one and the same subject. If we Mere not explorers, neither were we historians in quest of new materials, anti quarians on the scent of fresh discoveries, philosophers in search of facts and theories never advanced before, and bearing on the development of races and the destinies of nations, or politicians desirous of probing to the bottom the mysteries of the British constitution, laws, Parliamentary usage and traditions, and government, imperial, local or municipal. All these things, and many more besides, were matters of the utmost indifference to us, and if we happen once or twice to refer to them in an indirect manner, it is generally owing to some remark made by one of us, or by a friend, which was at the time entered in our note-book. Our chief object, as we have said before, was to enjoy ourselves, and, in addition, we were anxious to see as much of England as possible, and to get out, as far as could be done, of the beaten tracks of foreign tourists. For this reason we spent most of our time in the"], [17, "INTRODUCTION. XI country and very little in London, out of which huge Metropolis foreigners generally are very reluctant to stir. When in London we did not go to the Crystal Palace, nor to Windsor, nor to the Tower of London, and the British Museum knew us not. To the National Gallery we did go, and to one or two other picture-galleries besides, but we do not allude to them in this volume. It is not to be inferred from this that we do not fully appreciate the interest which attaches to these various places, but we were acquainted with them all through the innumer able books, essays, pictures and engravings which have been published about them, and we thought that, had we stayed even a month in London, we should have added very little to our knowledge, for a much longer time is required to do them justice. Coming to England, a country which is supposed to be well known to all, we wanted to find something new to see, and we believe we have been successful in our quest. We also were desirous of seeing the English at home, and for this purpose we selected the time and places where they are to be seen out of doors, that is, the holiday season, and the seaside and tourist resorts, and here again we succeeded. Finally, the chief cathedral cities, Canterbury and York, attracted the artist on account of their picturesque and historical interest, whilst the scribe felt very desirous of seeing such busy cities as Liverpool and Leeds. In order to satisfy both, our tour was planned so as to include picturesque regions such as Welsh holiday resorts, busy towns, religious centres, and popular places such as Margate and Bamsgate. And we believe that, having seen all these, we have acquired, though in a very short time, a better and more accurate knowledge of English manners and customs and of England generally, than if we had been satisfied with the usual London-cum-Crystal- Palace-cum-Windsor trip. Our expectations were, on the whole, fully realised, and we are certainly of opinion that England and Wales deserve to be better known to the people of the Continent than they are. Switzerland and its glaciers have now been so overrun by Continental tourists that they have become uninteresting, and Italy in the summer months is a place to be avoided. There are, within a few hours \u2014 a few minutes almost \u2014 of the French coast, a number of bright, delightful, seaside places where the heat is never oppressive, surrounded by picturesque and interesting localities, and situated in the midst of a beautiful country abounding in monu ments, castles, churches, not reckoning innumerable places for excursions by land and sea, and, in short, in everything that makes holiday travelling agreeable, and yet the counties of Kent and Sussex, not to mention remoter parts of England, are as little known to the French people as if they were on the other side of the Atlantic. This is not as it should be, and the French railway companies might do worse than give greater facilities to holiday-makers, so as to enable them to spend a few weeks on the English coast during the summer months. It would certainly be a most profitable undertaking, for"], [18, "INTRODUCTION. XII they would soon find that there are within their reach all the elements of a summer traffic which might be developed almost without limits, to their great advantage. We do not ask them to consider the inestimable boon which would result to both countries from a more constant intercourse between French and English tourists, as this is a matter which railway directors and managers are not supposed to take into consideration. But it would, nevertheless, follow, for people who have enjoyed themselves together, and lived together for weeks, as people do who frequent the same holiday and seaside resorts, learn to know one another quite as well if not better than when they are striking a bargain and doing business. And by an intercourse of that kind Englishmen and Frenchmen have nothing to lose and much to gain. After our experience in England and Wales, we can conscientiously recommend all French and other Continental tourists and holiday-makers to cross the Channel in August and Sep tember, ami try the seaside places of Kent and Surrey, and the picturesque districts of Wales, and we can promise them agreeable surprises and that greatest of all desiderata in this age of ours \u2014 novelty."], [19, "SKETCHES OF ENGLAND. CHAPTER I. nOVEE. LTHOUGH the weather was bright and clear when we left Calais, we found the coast of England enveloped in a light mist or haze, not sufficient, it is true, to intercept the rays of the sun, but very perceptible, and dense enough to limit the horizon. Here at once was a characteristic feature of the country we were on the point of reaching, and one which we hereafter found to be prevailing throughout all England, or at least through those parts of it which we visited Dover, from the deck of the steamer, presented a pleasant and picturesque appearance, and the mist, far from detracting from the beauty of the landscape, gave it, on the contrary, a new, and therefore attractive, aspect. The white houses of the town \u2014 nestling in a gap or valley between the heights crowned on one side by the citadel and on the other by the Castle \u2014 were standing out in the dark background formed by the hills on which large barracks of remarkably plain architecture have been erected. Above the town a cloud of smoke and mist was hovering, and softened the general tonality of the landscape, blending the colours and deadening the sharp angles of the outlines. To the right rose the tall rock on which stands the Castle, a mass of buildings of sombre hue, surrounded by thick walls bristling with towers, and looking altogether very formid able. The fleeting shadows of the passing clouds, intercepting at times the rays of the sun, threw curious reflections on the green sward, and produced remarkable effects of light and shade. On the opposite side the white cliffs, dazzling in the sun, extended in a broken line in the direction of Folkestone, dimly visible in the distance, and disclosed the yawning chasm in their sides tunnelled by the railway. Thus stands Dover between its castle and the cliffs, between the arts of war and the arts of peace, and, strange to say, owing its pros perity to this curious combination of adverse elements, for the presence of a large garrison certainly accounts for the flourishing condition of the town quite as much as the passenger and goods traffic of which it is the centre. Whilst thus gazing on the landscape (which put us in mind of a painting by Corot more than of anything that we could think of), the boat had reached the Admiralty Pier, and soon we were on British soil, after having made the acquaintance of the Custom-house officer and of the policeman, two worthy officials who, in all countries, are the first to greet the B"], [20, "SKETCHES OF ENGLAND. 2 stranger. The British Custom-house officer does not differ in any essential particular from his congener in other countries, but the British policeman is a massive and dignified being, who seems conscious of his importance. It cannot be denied that the first impression of a foreigner on landing at Dover is any thing but lively ; and if, as in our case, he arrives on a Sunday afternoon, when the streets are deserted, the shops closed, the traffic entirely suspended, the contrast between tbe animation prevailing on the other side of the Channel and the dulness on this is over powering. As a matter of course we did expect to find a marked difference between the two countries, but it must be confessed that the reality more than fulfilled our anticipation. By-the-bye, it is always said, and for some unaccountable reason accepted almost universally as a perfect truth, that England and France, though the nearest neighbours, know less of each other than the rest of Europe. The latter part of the proposition it is not our wish to deny ; in fact we fully agree with every word of it ; but that England and France are the nearest neighbours seems a bold assertion. To come from France to England involves a sea passage of more or less duration, according to the route taken, whilst one step to the north, north-east, east, south-east, or south of his own country will carry the Frenchman to Belgium, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, or Spain. Nay, more, his own coun trymen in the provinces bordering on these countries nearly always speak a dialect or patois understood on both sides of the frontier, and the manners of the people living on either side are, as a rule, very similar. England and France, on the contrary, being separated by the sea, there is not, and cannot be, between the inhabitants of the two countries, that constant personal intercourse which exists among populations living on the same continent, and separated by, in many cases, artificial boundaries only, and at most by a river or a chain of mountains. And the natural consequence is that the French and the English must of necessity know less of each other than the continental nations. To our mind, therefore, the geographical situation of the two countries fully accounts for the ignorance unfortunately prevailing on both sides as to the manners, customs, and charac teristics of each. But while deploring this ignorance, we must say that if the French can be excused for their lack of knowledge of English people, ways, and institutions, the English, on the contrary, have no extenuating circumstances to plead on their behalf for the no less remarkable want of accurate information displayed by them in regard to France and the French. This may at first appear a very paradoxical statement, but it is one which is, nevertheless easy to bear out by means of sound arguments. No one will deny that of all Europeans the English are the greatest travellers, and that they are to be met with in every country in Europe, not to speak of the other quarters of the globe. This alone would be a reason why they should be better informed as to foreign countries in general, France included, than the sons of Gaul, who are proverbially loth to leave their native land. It might, however be argued that the destination of every travelling English man, woman, and child is not neces sarily France, and that they chiefly go to Germany, Eussia, Austria, Switzerland, Italy, or"], [21, "DOVER. 3 Spain. Granted. But does not the road to Spain, Italy, Switzerland, Austria, Eussia, and Germany lie through France ? Further, does not every British functionary or officer bound for Egypt, India, and most of the British colonies, pass through France on his way to the East, whether he travels by way of Brindisi or Marseilles, of Mont Cenis or the St. Gothard ? On the contrary, where is the country on earth to reach which a Frenchman must of necessity travel by way of the United Kingdom ? It is not even neces sary to -'pause for a reply,\" for to put the question is to answer it, and it is quite evident that the reciprocal ignorance in which the two nations stand of each other, though equal in degree, is very intelligible as far as the French are concerned, but without excuse when the English are in question. As already stated, the first impres* From Calais to Dover. s^on ma(je \"^y Dover was one of con- siderable dulness, and exceeded the legitimate surprise felt at seeing for the first time, a real English town, having nothing in common with continental places. The brick houses, low and small, the peculiar sash-windows \u2014 termed in France fenetres a guillotine, because they slide up and down like the knife in Guillotin's ingenious machine \u2014 the curious inscriptions on the shops and signboards, were as nothing compared to the stillness and mournful appearance"], [22, "SKETCHES OF ENGLAND. 4 of the deserted streets, bordered by a double and endless line of closed doors and shutters. The only signs of animation visible in the narrow and tortuous thoroughfares of the town were in the vicinity of the churches, chapels, and mission-halls, the number of which appears to be comparatively large in proportion to the population. But even that was very little, and the only place where there was anything like a crowd was the open space in front of a hall occupied by our old friends the warriors of the Salvation Army. Before the entrance several policemen were keeping the idlers in order, and ready to suppress any attempt at break ing the peace. This extraordinary display of police was due, it appears, to the disturbances occasioned by the presence in Dover of the Salvationists, who had begun operations a few days before, when the rough element had given the soldiers of \" General \" Booth a warm reception. The solicitude of the authorities for the members of the Salvation Army is praiseworthy, but it does not appear to be extended to the peaceable citizens, who are left unprotected against the brass bands, tambourines, songs, and wild antics of these howling dervishes of the gutter. Were the Salvation Army a purely English institution it might be unbecoming on the part of foreigners to express an opinion on that extraordinary body; but as it is an aggressive association, as it does not confine itself to its original country, as its mummeries are not for home consumption only, but are the object of a considerable export trade, its international character enables us to say what we think of the \" army \" of which la marechule Booth is so typical a representative on the Continent. With the exception of this Salvation Army incident there was very little to break the monotony of this day of compulsory rest, and as a Sunday, even in England, has only the regular number of hours, although it may appear to have more than its proper allowance, darkness came on at last, the gas-lamps flickered in the streets and along the harbour and the beach, whose curved shape was thus outlined by a luminous cordon. On the rocks and on the cliffs above the town the windows of the barracks were ablaze with gaslight ; in the streets all was silent, and in the stillness of the night the black serpentine line of the pier stood out on the moonlit sea, and with its head-light shining in the darkness like the eye of some hideous monster, seemed a gigantic snake lying in wait for its prey. With the daylight, Dover assumed a very different appearance ; it was quite another town, busy, animated, and lively. On the pier the railway trains brought their contingent of passengers, who embarked in the steamers ready to convey them to Belgium or France. Bailway porters were transferring the luggage from the trains to the boats, and the mail bags under the superintendence of a gold-laced official, were carefully placed on board. The London papers, just arrived, were eagerly bought up by the visitors as well as by the passengers, anxious to have the latest information available on the events of which Bulgaria was then the theatre. Behind those vast sheets of paper the readers disappeared almost com pletely, nothing being seen of them but their boots and hats ; at a distance these papers when unfolded, look like the spread sails of small boats. As a rule the English do not cut their papers, probably for fear of losing half of them ; they unfold and refold them a man\u0153uvre of some difficulty at the sea-side when the wind is blowing."], [23, "DOVER. 5 By the time the passengers have settled comfortably in their places, the signal has been given to start. From the white funnels of the boats clouds of dense smoke are issuing ; the On Doveii Jetty, watching the Fhesh Akhivals, paddle-wheels stir the foaming waves, the pier seems to be moving ; but soon this optical delusion vanishes. And so do the mail packets, while the loungers and idlers, not very"], [24, "6 SKETCHES OF ENGLAND. numerous in the morning, either sit on benches on the pier or wend their way in the direction of the town. The basins of the harbour presented an equally busy scene. On the quays enormous piles of timber were being stacked, or removed on heavy carts drawn by fine powerful horses to the station, thence to be conveyed inland. Timber seems to be the chief article they import in the place. Two or three pretty sailing yachts were made fast to the iron posts on the quay. One of them, the largest and finest, as also the most elegantly furnished and appointed, had for its only visible occupant a lovely English child of some ten or twelve summers. The little maiden, in a costume of blue serge, wearing a sailor's cap from under which flowed her beautiful fair hair, was leaning over the bulwarks of the yacht, whose sides were being washed by a party of sailors in a small boat. The arch and pretty child was chatting with and teasing the men, who goodnaturedly replied and seemed to enjoy her innocent jokes, whilst a monkey, tied by a chain, restlessly climbed up and down the rigging as far as its fetters would allow, and occasionally uttered piercing shrieks. Here was a nice little subject for a sketch which was not to be missed by the artist. At a short distance from the yacht, alongside the quay, was a steamer belonging to the Royal Navy, as testified by the long white pennant flying from the mast. H. M.S. Cherub, as we ascertained her name to be, is a small and very old -looking gunboat. Turning from the harbour to the streets, a less animated scene met the e}re, yet the contrast with the day before was most striking and welcome. A busy and composite crowd was moving up aud down \u2014 sailors in heavy boots, smart officers belonging to the mail-packets, policemen and railway guards, labourers and loafers, servant girls and fine ladies, tourists and soldiers, whose gay and well-fitting uniforms here and there threw a brilliant patch of colour in a somewhat sombre picture. The shops on both sides seemed to be well filled with customers, but the shop windows do not appear to be so tastefully and neatly arranged as in several other country towns we saw afterwards. On the whole there is comparatively little vehicular traffic in the narrow streets of Dover, probably on account of the railway stations being so near the port. A swing bridge between two docks leads to the beach, parallel to which runs a good wide road bordered by neat houses, chiefly lodging and boarding houses, frequented in the summer by visitors from London. There are bathing places of various kinds ; some have a good sea and a number of bathers, others have bathers and no sea, others again have a good sea and no bathers, whilst, lastly, there are bathing places without either bathers or sea. There appears to be plenty of sea at Dover, but bathers are remarkably scarce ; the sharp slope of the beach covered with rough shingle may account for this, as it renders bathing both unpleasant and dangerous. The result is that the beach is little frequented except by nursemaids and children, and those people who prefer the solitary and undisputed occupation of a bench to tlie enjoyment in common of the seats on the pier. A number of ladies, for the greater part of mature age, were sitting on the benches reading novels or papers, and so deeply were they interested in the fate of their heroes or heroines, or in the intricacies of European politics, that they never"], [25, ""], [26, ""], [27, "ARRIVING AT DOVER"], [28, ""], [29, "DOVER 7 lifted their eyes from their books or journals to look at the sea or the passers-by. In some cases two occupied the same seat ; but they never spoke a word, although they were friends or relatives, and came and went away together. A lady, whose age might be thirty, was reading a book the yellow paper cover of which betokened its French origin, while her two young children were playing a little distance off, under the watchful eye of a nurse. We were rather puzzled to know what French author had the privilege of entertaining the fair daughter of John Bull, but it was impossible to see the title of the book she held on her knees. Was it one of Ohnet's works ? Was it one of Paul Bourget's psychological studies ? This problem would have remained to us an inscrutable mystery but for the fact that one of the children, rather roughly treated by its elder brother, came crying to seek refuge in his mother's lap. The book fell, and on the yellow cover we could plainly distinguish the four letters, NANA. Towards two o'clock in the afternoon streams of people from all parts of the town could be seen hastily moving in the direction of the Admiralty Pier, and although this place appears to be the favourite promenade of the visitors, it was evident that the simple arrival or departure of the boats, a sight witnessed on an average four times a day, could not attract so large a concourse of spectators. Not that we are inclined in any way to despise this, to us, always interesting spectacle of people embarking and disembarking. On the contrary, we like it. It is not the commonplace sight that people think. Are we not all passengers in this world ? have we not all set out from the same point, and is not our destination the same ? Like the travellers who file past before us, are we not all thrown in the company of all sorts and conditions of men, sometimes in one compartment, sometimes in another, of this great human train, and whether rich or poor, whether we travel first, second, or third class, are we not travelling at the same rate, drawn by the same engine, and bound for the same terminus ? Evidently something unusual was going to happen, and we soon learnt that the cause of this general migration towards the pier was the arrival of the Heir Apparent to the throne of the United Kingdom, who was on his way home from Germany. Here was an opportunity not to be missed to see, first, his Royal Highness, and, in the second place, an English crowd; and to the pier accordingly we made our way. The weather was magnificent, the sea was smooth, the sun's rays, filtered through the haze, were warm without being scorching, as would probably have been the case on the other side of the Channel, and a very light breeze, gently blowing at intervals, helped to make the afternoon as enjoyable as could be wished. The lower portion of the pier, that on which the railway lines are laid, was closed, the special train was drawn up at the platform, and red cloth spread across the line from the landing-stage to the steps of the saloon carriage. The upper portion of the pier is a rather narrow promenade, closed in on the outer side by a stone parapet, and on the inner side by iron railings ; at the extreme end of the pier are a circular battery and a lighthouse. The sight that awaited us was rather curious. The crowd, two or three deep, were leaning against the iron railings from the extremity of the pier to the place where the steamer, then in sight, was expected to stop. Walking along the whole length of the pier there was nothing to be seen but a long row of backs of human beings, whose heads disappeared under"], [30, "8 SKETCHES OF ENGLAND. the umbrellas and parasols held by the women as a protection against the rays of the sun. It was amusing to see that immense collection of umbrellas, looking like some sudden growth of gigantic mushrooms, hiding the heads and shoulders of the spectators, who were craning their necks in order to catch a glimpse of the Invicta, which was now entering the harbour. In a few moments the boat was alongside, and the Prince of Wales, in a brown suit, wearing a brown hat and buff leather shoes, and carrying a stick in his hand, could be seen standing on the deck, a very picture of health and happiness. It would seem that the Prince's features, despite the number of photographs of him exhibited in all the shop windows, are not so familiar to his future subjects as one might think, for he was not readily recognised by the crowd. \" Where is he ? \" \"I can't see him,\" were the words on all our neighbours' lips ; for by this time we had mixed with, and were wedged in, the crowd, at the imminent risk of having our eyes gouged out by the ribs of our fair neighbours' parasols. \" That's him, in the brown coat,\" suddenly exclaimed some one. And sure enough there was the Prince, his countenance beaming, to all appearance, with satisfaction at being once again in England. A general and two aides-de-camp in uniform, with cocked hats and plumes fluttering in the breeze, at this moment stepped on board the Invicta, and gave the Prince the military salute. Tired, no doubt, of being stared at by some two or three thousand pairs of eyes, in not a few instances assisted by marine glasses and telescopes levelled at him with the coolest sans-gene, the Prince, followed by General Fielding \u2014 such was the name of this officer \u2014 went to the other side of the boat, and leaning against the bulwarks, engaged in conversation with the commander of the south-eastern district, all the while turning his back to the admiring and well-meaning, but somewhat indiscreet, crowd. In the meantime his Royal Highness's luggage was being transferred from the depths of the steamer to the vans, the sailors and railway men being busy with the large and heavy boxes, whilst two or three servants in the royal livery carried to the saloon a quantity of smaller articles. All this took a considerable time, during which the crowd looked on silently. Not a hat was raised, not a voice was heard, when at last, all being in readiness, the Prince stepped on shore and entered the saloon carriage. The train immediately steamed out of the pier, and after being lost sight of for an instant, whilst going through the station, was seen again for a moment, but soon disappeared under the Shakespeare Cliff. The crowd then filed past leisurely, enjoying the fine weather, the sunshine, and the beautiful sight presented by the green waters of the Channel, dotted by a number of small boats, whose white sails spread out looked in the distance like the wings of large seagulls. And an interesting scene it was, yet not so new as might have been expected. These men, women, and children seemed as old acquaintances to the artist, who, however, had never before set eyes on an English crowd. Yet they were familiar types and faces. How was that? Suddenly a thought flashed across his mind: \"I have it!\" he exclaimed, \"I have seen them all in Caldecott's drawings. I took him for a caricaturist, but he was a portrait painter, and true to the life ! \" And there they were all in the flesh \u2014 ladies and young girls in light-coloured muslin dresses with fur capes. What a combination ! Men in shooting suits, in boating or cricketing"], [31, "DOVER. 9 costumes, in striped jackets and caps of extraordinary colours, red and white, black and yellow, blue and green, and white flannel continuations ; here were two Scotchmen in kilts, a strange sight to the foreigner ; there some soldiers, remarkably young, with bright scarlet coats ; children in pretty and elegant costumes, with ruddy cheeks, and a healthy glow in their sparkling eyes, and sun-burnt hands and le beg pardon \u2014 lower limbs ! Hum ! It was a delightful and picturesque scene, full of animation and colour, for the English have an apparently innate love of bright hues, and seem particularly fond of red, a colour of which all the shades are worn by men and women alike. Moliere, in Le Medecin malgre lui, speaks of Hippo crates' \"Chapter on Hats.\" Had the Father of Medicine lived in Great Britain he might have written not only a chapter but a whole treatise on head coverings. One must come to England to have an idea of what numerous and extraordinary shapes the head-gear of men and women can assume. The fertility of invention displayed by British hat-makers and milliners is something positively astounding, of which no conception can be formed, and which baffles all description. Hats high and low, small and large, broad-brimmed and narrow-brimmed, trimmed with feathers, and lace, and flowers, and birds, or having all these together heaped up in a confusion which has nothing artistic about it ; caps of every shape, style, and material, nautical, Scotch, woollen, silken, knit or what not, ornamented with gold lace, or anchors, or stars, are worn by women, girls, and children. The women are all remarkably fond of sporting men's hats and caps, and more especially those abominable double peaked caps resembling an immature helmet, with a little knot at the top, which look as if they had them made of their brothers' or husbands' old jackets. These hideous things are so unbecoming that, by A jMan of Kent wearing them, English women and girls have actually been able to accomplish the marvellous feat of looking \u2014 well, not pretty. But the costumes and dresses are far from being the most interesting things in a crowd, although they give it a certain character. The people are what is particularly striking, and none can possibly be more so than the English. In the first instance the national type is most noticeable. On the Continent Belgians, Austrians, Germans, French, Spaniards, and Italians can more or less be taken one for another, but the English man or woman cannot be 0"], [32, "SKETCHES OF ENGLAND. 10 mistaken for any of these. There is about them an unmistakable characteristic appearance which precludes the possibility of an erroneous guess as to their nationality. The Anglo- Saxon race, owing to its insular abode, has remained much purer than any other in Europe. This is apparent both in the higher and lower classes of the people, where mixed marriages are comparatively very few. The men, as a rule, are tall and good-looking ; the women, especially when young, are remarkably pretty ; many are really beautiful ; they have a peculiar bearing which cannot be called graceful, and yet is not devoid of charm ; one cannot imagine Englishwomen walking or talking like French or Italian women. They must be judged by a different standard. But the most extraordinary thing about the English, men and women alike, is their com plete lack of facial expression. They all have the same rigid, unmoved countenance, which might be described as the air of people who are tremendously bored ; but as it cannot be supposed that the whole nation is bored \u2014 although they certainly look it \u2014 the task of describing their expression is practically impossible. Whether they talk politics, science, or religion, whether they make love or quarrel \u2014 and it may reasonably be assumed that in a crowd such as that at Dover all these might have been going on at the same time \u2014 the closest observer cannot detect any outward sign of what they are thinking or saying. As to laughing, such a thing as laughter never struck our ears. Now, do not let the reader or critic run away with the idea that we say that the English never laugh. They must laugh, as they must eat or drink ; in fact, we know they do ; but not in public. Probably laughing in public is con sidered bad form ; and if so, nothing could be more absolutely perfect than the form of the Dover crowd. For the same reason also conversation is carried on in a low tone of voice, and with long pauses or silent intervals. How a people so little addicted to talking as the Euglish can produce, such long-winded public speakers, who in Parliament or in meetings go on uninterruptedly speaking for hours at a time, and whose endless speeches are so care fully reported in the closely-printed columns of the daily papers, is one of those mysteries that cannot be explained. It is certainly a striking fact that in a number of people assembled together at the seaside in fine weather, and having nothing to do but to enjoy themselves, as their dress and leisurely movements indicated, no visible sign of joy, or pleasure, or excitement was dis cernible, although we tried hard to discover even the faintest mark of such expression. Do these people enjoy themselves? is a question we frequently, during a several weeks' tour in England, asked each other, but we could not make up our mind one way or the other. Yet on the Continent we had seen English people laughing and enjoying themselves, or, at all events, looking certainly as if they did, although in their own country they seem so bored. Now, what can be the cause of that ? Is it because among themselves they feel bound to assume that highly proper but eminently dull countenance, just as they put on a dress-coat to go to a music-hall in London, when, in Paris, a shooting-jacket is considered good enough for the opera? Are there such things as mental or spiritual dress-coats and shooting jackets ? If it were so a whole world of thoughts would be opened up, many idiosyncrasies"], [33, "DOVER 11 would become intelligible, many things hitherto unaccounted for would be explained, and the solution of innumerable intellectual problems would be found with the greatest ease. Be that as it may, the chief characteristic of an English crowd is that the people are essentially silent. Froissart said, or is credited with the saying, that the English take their pleasure sadly, which, by implication, means that they do take their pleasure \u2014 occasionally. Was not Froissart a little rash ? Having seen the town, the harbour, the pier, and the people, there remained to be seen the Castle, to which the public has free access. A steep footway, at the end of a narrow lane skirting a churclryard, leads to the top of the rock on which stands Dover Castle. The Castle, that is the numerous buildings, barracks, storehouses, batteries, bastions, and other specimens of military architecture which have gradually cropped up round the old Norman keep and towers, occupies a space of some thirty-five acres. The present fortress stands on the same spot as the Norman defensive works which had replaced the Saxon stronghold, itself a substitute for the Roman fortifications erected probably on the site of some hill fort built in early times by the ancient Britons. We are not answerable for this remarkable display of erudition, which is within the reach of everybody, and it matters very little to us, who are but sorry arch\u00e6ologists, who were the founders of Dover Castle. But what concerns us more when gazing on those walls, whether of fanes or of strongholds, which have stood the test of time, is to know what could have been the thoughts, the hopes, the passions of the men who erected them, not of the chieftains, be they Roman or Saxon, Norman or Briton, but of the humble toilers who hewed the stones or carried them on their back to the top of the rock. What existence, what joys and sorrows, were theirs? Were they prisoners, working without hope, and awaiting Death as their Liberator ? Had those hands, whose work is before our eyes, wielded the sword in sunnier climes, far away, in defence of hearth and country ; and were the builders of Dover Castle victims of war, paying the usual penalty of the vanquished, or free men raising stout walls to repulse the attack of an invading foe ? Ah ! the record of the conquests, the triumphs of Julius C\u00e6sar is a wonderful, a thrilling epic, but how infinitely more interesting would be the simple story, could we but get it, of a stonemason of the time of the great general and dictator ! One of the curiosities of the Castle is the long gun, a remarkable and useless piece of ordnance some twenty-three feet in length, cast at Utrecht in 1544, and presented to Henry VIII. by the Emperor Charles V. This last particularity does not perhaps sufficiently warrant its being called \" Queen Elizabeth's Pocket Pistol\"; at all events this name is quite as justified as that of Pont-Neuf bestowed on the oldest bridge of Paris. This venerable bronze cannon, tastefully ornamented with various devices, salamanders, and other allegorical decorations, and mounted on wheels, the spokes of which are in the shape of a lictor's axe and fasces, has been clothed by time with a beautiful green patina. On a board hard by is reproduced the Dutch inscription on the long gun. For the benefit of those ignorant persons whose neglected education does not enable them to read Dutch, or c 2"], [34, "SKETCHES OF ENGLAND. 12 rather Flemish, the considerate authorities have had the kindness to give of it the following poetical translation : \u2014 O'er hill and dale I throw my ball, ' Breaker,' my name, of mound and wall.\" There seems to be every reason to believe that at present \"Breaker\" would prove dangerous only to the rash artilleryman, were such a person to be found, who might venture on firing it. From the earthworks adjoining the open space where stands the \" Pocket Pistol\" ofthe Virgin Queen there is a very fine view of the Channel and ofthe town. Beyond the green waves, reflecting as in a mirror the rays of the sun, the coast of France could be distinguished, a darker hazy outline on the misty horizon ; in the hollow, between the western heights and the bluff castle rock, was Dover, an agglomeration of white houses with sombre, cold-coloured slate roofs ; over the town hung a pall of smoke and light fog, in which here and there played a beam of warm summer sunlight, giving forth occasionally a golden-coloured gleam which lighted up the busy hive at our feet. The Colton Tower and the Pharos, the latter showing traces of Roman masonry, are two octagonal towers, whose ruined battlemented walls, clad with ivy, are very picturesque, but like all ruined edifices are better seen from a little distance than too near. As the small church of St. Mary within Dover Castle \u2014 the name is almost bigger than the thing \u2014 happened to be closed, we repaired to the keep, an imposing square edifice of Norman construction, composed of three storeys and crowned by turrets. From the top of the keep the view is very fine, but not finer than that to be had from the earthworks at the foot, and hardly repays the tourist for making the ascent (91 feet 9 inches it is said), unless he wishes to ascertain what is the meaning of 30^ yards translated into innumerable stone steps in a winding staircase. A large tower \u2014 whose windows, of modern construction, behind which could plainly be seen curtains and pieces of furniture that were unmistakably of recent origin, were open, and from which issued the sounds of a piano \u2014 rose above an archway leading to a carriage road. This was the Constable's Tower, where the commandant resides. In former days the Constable of Dover Castle, who was also the Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, Sandwich, Dover, Hythe, Romney and Hastings, was a mighty person, entrusted with military and judicial duties of considerable importance. Now, to be Constable of Dover Castle and Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports (which are reduced to two, Dover and Hastings) means doing the work by deputy, receiving, but not by deputy, three thousand a year, and having, as a marine residence, Walmer Castle. The sun was going down behind the Castle, and it was time to think of returning to the town. A row of artisans' dwellings, in a little street off Castle Hill, took the artist's fancy, and he accordingly began to sketch this picturesque row of gabled-roof cottages, composed of a ground-floor and a storey above, the lower part of the houses being faced with cement, whilst the upper portion is of red bricks of various patterns. Each house had a little garden"], [35, "DOVER. 13 before it, and was separated from the street by red palings. As one walked along the street a good view could be obtained of the rooms inside, the doors and windows being open, all neatly furnished and scrupulously clean and tidy. At most of the windows were flowers cultivated with evident care, and in the gardens grew in great quantities large sunflowers which seem to be much in favour, for they are to be found in the vicinity of all working men's houses or cottages in England and in Wales. Whilst the scribe was smoking a cigarette and spying the nakedness of the land, the artist was gradually surrounded by a crowd of children increasing every moment to such an Suburban Architectue at Dover. extent that he was unable to move his arm. Emboldened by his benevolent looks and his inability to say a word of English, the young urchins began to pass critical remarks on his work, and to point with their fingers to the features in it they were able to recognise. One thought he could see his own house ; another with great glee could distinguish a lamp-post. All the while the circle grew narrower and narrower, and the artist was in great clanger of being submerged by this rising tide of youthful inquisitiveness, when the scribe, perceiving the danger, executed a rapid flank movement, and put to flight the seventeen youngsters, who were dispersed like sparrows before a running terrier."], [36, "14 SKETCHES OF ENGLAND. Having taken a stroll through the town, very busy and animated at this hour, we reached the road which runs parallel to the beach. There, by the flickering light of a gas-lamp, three men, in good coats and tall hats, evidently foreigners, most likely Italians or Spaniards, were playing a spirited march on three mandolines, and a crowd of young girls and boys surrounded them, listening with pleasure to the music discoursed by the itinerant artists. This was a curious and unusual sight, and with the strange effect of the gas-light on the faces of both players and listeners, well calculated to please an artist, for here was a delightful genre picture, and at the same time an interesting and essentially English popular scene. Here another insight could be obtained into the life and customs of a superior and very different class of people. All the houses in the Marine Parade and Waterloo Crescent had their windows open, and the lamps being lighted, a good view of the interior could be had. It was curious to note that the sameness so conspicuous in the outside appearance of the houses was equally striking and remarkable in the interior arrangements. It was about seven o'clock, and every dining-room, occupying in each house the very same position, presented exactly the same aspect. At the back, facing the window, was the same sideboard, the same disposition of the furniture prevailed throughout, the same chairs were placed round the same table, at which were seated the same people, relishing most probably the same dishes. It used to be said of a French Minister of Public Instruction that, sitting in his official depart ment, and looking at his watch, he could say, \" At this moment every schoolboy in France is engaged upon a Latin translation.\" It can be asserted with equal accuracy that at seven o'clock punctually every man, woman, and child visitor at Dover is sitting down to dinner. Perhaps the same thing obtains in all countries, and allowing for the difference in the customs of their respective nations, the French, Germans, Italians, and Spaniards similarly perform the same act at the same time. Very likely ; but the peculiar construction of English houses enables one to see what is going on inside, and thus a very striking feature attracts the attention of all foreigners travelling in England. At night Dover seems as busy as in daytime, at least, until at half-past nine the Castle gun booms forth, and the bugles and drums intimate to the population in general, and to the soldiers of the garrison in particular, that the time has come to turn in. We took the hint and retired to our hotel, for the next morning early we were to leave Dover for Canterbury."], [37, "CHAPTER II. CANTEEBUEY. \u00a7OTJ[3|HE journey from Dover to Canterbury was accomplished in a short time, the rS^-jl feSs\u00a7 railway passing through very commonplace scenery, calling for no special notice. The convenient railway stations, which passengers can enter as they please, and the comfortable carriages, especially the second and third-class compart ments, the latter infinitely superior from every point of view to the best second class carriages on French lines, made a deep impression on the artist, who for the first time travelled on an English railway. The only incident that occurred on the way was the question asked from the scribe by a foreign lady who, with her husband, happened to get into the same compartment. Hearing the scribe give a few explanations in French to his companion, she, in her sweetest tones, but with a strong German accent, inquired from him who was Lord \"Warden, whose name she had seen so frequently at Dover and in the neighbourhood ? The worthy lady took it to be the name of some great English statesman or general. A few words sufficed to set her mind at rest on a question which it seems had troubled her very much, and a few minutes afterwards we got out of the train at Canterbury, leaving her a wiser and. let us hope, a happier woman for the information it had been our privilege to give her. There are few places richer in historical associations than the old city of Canterbury, the \" Capital of Kent\" as it was enthusiastically called by a local historiographer, the \" Strong hold of the Kentishmen,\" as its old name Cant waraby rig, now altered to Canterbury, implied. Founded by the Britons, occupied at a later period by the Romans, who bestowed upon it the name of Durovernum, said to be a Latinised form of the early British name Dur Gwern, Canterbury does not seem to have risen to great eminence among British cities until the advent of St. Augustine in 597. The great missionary, followed by forty monks, having landed in the Isle of Thanet, came to Canterbury, where the conversion of King Ethelbert, of his chiefs, and of some thousands of his men, took place soon after his arrival. With Christianity civilisation made great strides in the country, yet for some reason Canterbury never acquired that importance as a city which it might have been expected to reach. It was from the first what it has remained to this day, a monastic town, in which the religious element predominated ; and it is a curious fact that monastic cities in all countries seem doomed to vegetate in a state of backwardness, as if the old clerical associations heavily handicapped them in the modern race for progress. The first English Christian city in date,"], [38, "16 SKETCHES OF ENGLAND. Canterbury is at the present time the first English cathedral city, the seat of the great archbishopric, whose occupant holds the proud position of Primate of all England. Why all England ? Because there is another English archbishop, the Most Reverend His Grace the Lord Archbishop of York, who rejoices in the title of Primate of England. This seems to the foreigner a distinction without a difference ; for if we turn to our dictionary we find that the word primate means first in rank in the ecclesiastical hierarchy. How can the two, then, be first ? And what is the difference between England and all England ? The first question must be left to others to solve, but the second is capable of a mathematical expla nation. This little word all means to the dignitary who is entitled to use it before the word England \u00a35,000 a year more than the other Primate gets, which is at the rate of \u00a31,666 13s. 4d. per letter per annum. So there is a difference between the Primate of all England and the Primate of plain England. The streets of Canterbury, narrow and lined with low houses, are decorous, dull, and dirty, as becomes such a very ecclesiastical looking city. The grass may well grow in them, as at Versailles, for the traffic appears to be conspicuous by its absence. Here and there, however, are some picturesque nooks and corners. On a fine day, the two Stours, running between curious houses, have a Venetian appearance, the more remarkable as it is so totally unexpected. In the High Street a few old houses, with pointed gables and overhanging storeys, and low windows with small panes of glass set in lead, are in keeping with the generally antiquated appearance of the town. One of these, situated near the West Gate, is now an inn, wdiose old-fashioned signboard, a remarkable specimen of local pictorial art, hangs from an elaborately designed wrought-iron bracket. There is a story of an old furniture dealer who, anxious to palm off a certain cabinet of doubtful antiquity on an unwary customer, insisted with great energy that it was \" of the period.\" \" Of what period?\" inquired the almost convinced intending purchaser. \" I don't know,\" said the dealer, \"but I can swear it is of the period.\" It would seem that the inhabitants of Canterbury also are of the period. One cannot by looking at them say exactly to what period their origin can be ascribed, but they certainly look very antiquated. The \"oldest inhabitant\" ofthe city must date back some centuries. From the account given by the natives themselves, even the attractions of that magnifi cent monument, the cathedral of Canterbury, are insufficient to induce the travellers and tourists to make a prolonged stay in the town. We are told that Americans sometimes stay two or three days, and that since the Jesuits, expelled from France some years ago, have established a college in the neighbourhood there is a greater number of foreign visitors, who remain a few days at a time. It is an ill wind that blows nobody good, and the hotel keepers and tradesmen of Canterbury have every reason to congratulate themselves on the presence, within a short distance of their city, of the expelled Jesuits. At a small inn where we had an extempore lunch the waiters, questioned by us as to whether they had many visitors during the season, denied all knowledge of such a thing as a season in Canterbury, and added, \" They don't come here, sir ; they like the sea-side best.\""], [39, "CANTERBURY. 17 Having arrived early, we took a walk through the town before going to the cathedral, so as to have a general view of the place. The West Gate, one of the few remaining portions of the old walls, first attracts attention. It is the only one of the six entrances through which access could be had into the ramparts of ancient Canterbury that has been left standing, the other five having been pulled down at various epochs, to the great detriment of the city's appearance. It stands near the bridge Personally-conducted Tourists. over the Stour, and consists of two circular towers, battlemented and loop-holed, connected by a high machicolated wall rising over a pointed gate. The upper portion of the structure is now used as a police-station and a city prison. Through irregular and straggling streets, chiefly remarkable on account of their deserted and dismal aspect and of the great number of barbers' shops to be seen in this ancient city, we reached the Dane John, or public gardens, which are very well laid out and kept in excellent order, as indeed are all gardens, public or private, in England. The British love of nature, of flowers, is everywhere noticeable, and there are no gardeners in the world so D"], [40, "SKETCHES OF ENGLAND 18 skilful as the English, who display in the arrangement and laying out of their parks and pleasure grounds, even in the smallest and most insignificant localities, the greatest ability. The Dane John\u2014 a singular name, said to be a corruption of the word donjon\u2014 is a very pleasant place, much resorted to, as far as could be judged, by nursemaids driving perambulators and watching over rosy, chubby children confided to their care. A portion of the old city walls, with recesses formed by the remains of towers and watch turrets, is here visible, and one of the walks passes along the top of the ramparts. Close by is the Mound, a lofty embankment, perhaps the site of some early fortification, from the top of which, accessible by means of a zigzag path, a very beautiful view of the cathedral is to be obtained. The immense edifice is from no point of the city seen to better advantage. Its colossal proportions are very striking, especially the length of the whole structure and the height of the three pinnacled towers rising proudly into the air and standing out boldly against the sky. On a bench were sitting an officer of the Salvation Army and two Hallelujah lasses in the well-knowm uniform of General Booth's myrmidons. It is a fact worthy of notice that the Salvationists seem to have a marked predilection for cathedral cities, where of all places in the world we should think they stood but very little chance of being listened to. If, as argued on their behalf, their object is to assist the regular clergy, cathedral cities, with their large ecclesiastical staff, are not the proper field for their exertions; but if, on the other hand, they have in view to compete with and dominate over the clergy of the Church of England, General Booth may be congratulated on having succeeded in waging war right into the enemy's camp. Not far from the Dane John is the castle, or rather the walls of the Norman keep of the old fortress, now turned into a coal depot belonging to a gas company. It is a pity to see this venerable structure used for suoh purposes. The cathedral of Canterbury is approached by a narrow lane, at the end of which is a fine gate of perpendicular style, called Christchurch Gate. It was built in 1517 by Prior Goldstone, and has been considerably injured by time and, not unlikely, by the hand of man. Of the church of King Ethelbert and St. Augustine nothing now remains ; but the cathedral is said to occupy the site of that ancient church, which was set on fire and destroyed by the Danes in 1011. Canute is said to have restored it, but we have it on undoubted authority that when Archbishop Lanfranc, the first archbishop after the Norman Conquest, came to Canterbury, he found the church in ruins, and proceeded to reconstruct it, as well as the monastic buildings. His successors continued the work he had begun, at the same time enlarging, and to some extent remodelling, the original structure, and the edifice was finally completed and dedicated in 1130 by Archbishop William. The dedication appears to have been a very imposing ceremony, graced with the presence of two kings, Henry I. of England and David of Scotland, and of all the bishops of England. Forty years later, in 1170, Becket was murdered in this same church by the three knights Reginald Fitzurse, William de Tracy, and Richard le Bret, who, together with Hu\u00bbh de Moreville, came over from France to commit the bloody deed, if not at the instigation of"], [41, "CANTERBURY. 19 Henry II. , at least in the hope of winning the favour of their royal master, whom they had rid of a redoubtable adversary and one who wielded considerable power and influence in the kingdom. Within four years of the tragedy enacted within its walls a fire broke out in the church and destroyed the choir, which was reconstructed by William of Sens and William the Englishman with even greater magnificence than before. Two centuries later, Lanfranc's nave was pulled down and rebuilt, as were also the transepts, and the cathedral was constantly adorned, enriched, and added to until the end of the fifteenth century. Passing under the south porch we entered the nave, which is magnificent. The lofty stone pillars supporting the roof ornamented with frescoes, the After Service, Canterbury*. beautiful mullioned windows, though now deprived of their ancient stained glass, the majestic proportions of the edifice, all tend to create a deep impression of admiration and wonder. At the end of the nave is a splendidly carved screen which separates it from the choir, to which access is gained by a flight of steps. From the western extremity of the nave the eye cau reach to the end of the choir and embrace the whole length of the building, measuring from end to end 514 feet."], [42, "SKETCHES OF ENGLAND. 20 The choir being closed, application to visit it and the other portions of the cathedral was made to a verger who was sitting on a bench in the nave, engaged in what was evidently a very interesting conversation with a young lady with red hair. This func tionary replied that we were to wait at the bottom of the steps until the other party, gone in a little while before, came out. There was nothing to do but to wait and look round. When the first impression of wonder has somewhat lost its intensity, the immense nave, in spite of the beauty and symmetry of its proportions, appears cold and naked. There is, it is true, a deep-rooted prejudice in England against the ornamentation of churches, so common on the Continent, especially in Roman Catholic temples. It is contended \u2014 apart from any feeling of reverence and of religious opinion, which it is not intended to discuss here, sentiments of such kind being entitled to every respect \u2014 it is contended that the introduction of paintings, sculpture, and the like spoils the appearance of a church by hiding some details of architecture, and dwarfs, or prevents from forming a correct opinion of, the proportions of the edifice. This seems, to our mind, a very defective argument, for one might as well say that the furniture in Windsor Castle ought to be removed, because the proportions of the various apartments are not so well grasped by the arch\u00e6ologist or architect. On the contrary, in many cases, the presence of fur niture, of paintings on the walls, of statues, enhances and makes more conspicuous the dimensions of the galleries or halls of great monuments. Now we are quite aware that a cathedral is not a dwelling-house, nor even a royal palace, but it must be remembered, nevertheless, that the builders of Canterbury were Roman Catholic monks and prelates who, according to the custom of their creed, never intended this splendid edifice, or for that matter any other temple raised by them, to remain bare and naked. The very stained glass in the windows would, in default of any other proof, point victoriously to a very different conclusion. At all events the nave were better without any attempt at ornamentation than with such extraordinary decorations as, for instance, the so-called monument erected to the memory of some officers and men of the 16th Queen's Lancers, who died in Afghanistan in 1842. This amazing specimen of the sculptor's art is as out of place in a church as would be one of \" Punch's \" cartoons. At last a party of tourists, amongst whom were a few Americans, personally conducted by a verger, came out of the choir, and we joined them. What a pity it is that people cannot be allowed to visit a church unless under the guidance of those men, who hurry you through the most interesting parts of the edifice, call your attention to worthless things, and sprinkle the whole with explanations and comments which are utterly useless when they are not downright ridiculous ! Of course the vergers must live; and they might be much better employed as a sort of police to see that no injury is done by visitors than as ciceroni, a part which they are totally unfitted to play. However, there was no help for it, and we followed the old verger, whose manner of speaking seemed to be particularly hateful to an American gentleman, who, hearing us speak in French, confidentially informed us that the verger was addicted to the unfortunate habit of inserting h's where there should be none, and dropping many of these letters when he"], [43, "CANTERBURY. 21 should have aspirated them, and wound up by advising us in French\u2014 a language he spoke tolerably well and fluently\u2014 to go to America if we wished to learn to speak English correctly. Under the con duct of our guide we entered the transept of the martyr dom, so called because there Becket was slain on the 29th of December, 1170. Nothing now remains ofthe transept where the scene actually took place save some portions of the wall in the west corner of the chapel. A very fine window with some portions of old stained glass, and the monuments of Archbishops Peckham and Warham, are among the noticeable fea tures in the transept, espe cially the wooden effigy on the first-named prelate's tomb. The cloisters were next Denizens ot Kent. visited. They are a very fine specimen of the perpendicular architecture, and the tracery of the windows, formerly filled in with glass, is of remarkable design. They form a perfect square enclosing an open"], [44, "SKETCHES OF ENGLAND. 22 space which is said to have been the herb-garden of the convent. Very little time is allowed to see the cloisters, or indeed anything else, and returning to the nave, we were, at the steps leading to the choir, handed over to another verger who was to take us through that portion of the edifice. This second verger, a much younger man than the first, stammered and stuttered to an alarming extent, and had to repeat three or four times the first words of each sentence before he could rush on to the end of it. It is needless to say that this impediment of speech detracted considerably from the distinctness of our guide's elocution. It was painful to hear, and some of the lady visitors could with difficulty refrain from giggling when the verger was stumbling over some difficult word. Passing through the magnificent and elaborately carved stone screens we found ourselves in the choir, the walls of which are not parallel, but bend towards each other. This is a very curious feature of the choir, which is unusually long (180 feet), and on this account appears extremely narrow. It was the work of William of Sens, who with great skill and taste combined in the architecture of this portion of the cathedral the Norman and Early English styles. The ribbed stone vault, the delicately carved capitals of the pillars, the contrast of the Purbeck marble and Caen stone, all contribute to make of the choir of Canterbury Cathedral one of the most admirable specimens of Gothic architecture. A very beautiful screen encloses the choir ; it was built in the fourteenth century, but has been much damaged and was recently restored. The altar, raised to a great height, is reached by a flight of steps. This extraordinary arrangement is due to the difference of level in the roofs of the two crypts ; it is curious, but the effect is more striking than really beautiful. Behind it is a reredos of modern construction, the ornamentation of which has been copied from some decorations in a chapel in the crypt. Passing from the choir into the south-east transept, and thence into St. Anselm's tower, we returned to the Trinity Chapel, also called St. Thomas's Chapel, in which were deposited in great pomp the remains of Becket, fifty years after the murder, in 1220. Three hundred years later, Henry VIII. issued a summons \" to thee, Thomas Becket, sometime Archbishop of Canterbury,\" in which the said Becket was charged with treason and rebellion, and a number of equally serious offences, and summoned to appear at Westminster within thirty days after this remarkable document had been read in the cathedral. As Becket did not appear on the appointed day, judgment was given in default against him, and the sentence was to the effect that his bones should be publicly burnt and the offerings made at the shrine forfeited to the king. This was the object in view \u2014 securing the gold and jewels which adorned the saint's shrine. The sentence was carried out, the royal coffers were replenished, and the bones of Becket were scattered to the winds. Nothing therefore remains of the splendid shrine which had excited the admiration of generation after generation of pilgrims and worshippers. In this chapel is the monument of Edward the Black Prince, the hero of Crecy and Poitiers. His brass effigy bears marks of the gilding with which it was ornamented and above are to be seen the most interesting historical relics in the cathedral. Here is the"], [45, "CANTERBURY. 23 A Corner of the Cathedral, Canterbury."], [46, "SKETCHES OF ENGLAND. 24 Black Prince's helmet, lined with leather and surmounted by a leopard ; here are his brass gauntlets and his wooden shield covered with leather; there too hangs his velvet coat embroidered with the arms of France and England, the fleurs-de-lys being plainly visible as they stand out in black on the grey-coloured garment. By the side of this coat is an empty scabbard. The sword the Black Prince wielded at Crecy and Poitiers has been removed, to use a mild term, by Oliver Cromwell. Here also are the tombs of Henry IV and his wife, Joau of Navarre, of Dean Wotton, of Archbishop Courtenay, and of Odet de Coligny, Cardinal dc Chatillon. Three windows in this chapel are still filled with the original stained glass placed there in the thirteenth century ; they represent the miracles worked by Becket. The design and colouring of these windows are alike admirable, and it must be confessed that for purity, brilliancy, and variety of tints, they are far superior to anything the modern glass-stainers are capable of producing. Glass-staining is certainly an art which our forefathers practised with more skill than we can boast of, even in this age of progress. In one of the side chapels is placed the archiepiscopal chair, called St. Augustine's chair, in which, according to tradition, the kings of Kent were enthroned, and in which are now enthroned the Archbishops of Canterbury. The young men and girls of our party in turn sat in the chair in couples, laughing and giggling with anything but respect and reverence for the sanctity of the place. In fact some of the male visitors accompanied the explanations of the' verger with a tune from the Mikado, which they whistled very audibly, and with a display of considerable if misplaced talent, for the well-known melody \"They'll none of 'em be missed \" could plainly be heard. This was appropriate, however, as far as applicable to themselves. We were then, after being trotted through a number of smaller chapels, turned out of the choir, whilst a fresh party of visitors were in their turn taken in tow by the verger. Once more we went round the nave admiring the beautiful pillars and light roof, and especially the exquisite proportions and symmetry of the whole edifice, which for its imposing appear ance and grandeur is well-nigh unsurpassed. The precincts contain very interesting remains of the old monastic buildings, and particularly some elegant arches now in ruins, but clad with ivy and creeping plants hanging in picturesque confusion from the broken mullions, trailing round the mutilated shafts and through which the sun played, projecting fanciful and lace-like shadows on the green swrard. A narrow passage leads into a quadrangle called the Green Court, surrounded by quaint old buildings with beflowered and ivied windows consisting of small iron frames with minute glass panes set in lead, and which bear the unmistakable imprint of ages gone by. There is a museum at Canterbury containing some collections well worth seeing it appears, but of which we can only speak by hearsay, for whilst the artist was sketching a delightful little corner in the Green Court, the scribe, to his utter astonishment and intense disgust, found the staircase of the museum barred, and this inscription in nine-inch letters CLOSED, stared him in the face. On the right and left of the hall were two deserted rooms, reading-rooms, it said on the"], [47, "CANTERBURY. 25 door, but on further examination a small boy was discovered behind an unfurled London newspaper. In reply to inquiries, this young keeper of the museum informed the would-be visitor that the museum closed at four. It was exactly three minutes past the fatal hour. And so we did not see the Anglo-Saxon drinking-cup of twisted glass, nor the statuette of Latona, nor the British pearl found in a Whitstable oyster, nor the walking-stick of Gostling, author of \" A Walk Round Canterbury.\" A walk round Canterbury \u2014 what a bright idea ! Unfortunately the weather, hitherto clear and fine, suddenly turned wet, and the rain poured in torrents. An attempt to wade through the streets, whose aspect, usually dull, had become perfectly dismal, turned out an abject failure ; besides, night was falling fast. And under a canopy of black clouds, through the dark and deserted lanes, dimly lighted here and there by a few gas lamps, and, in places, by the greater light thrown out by the illuminated shop windows, in the cold rain and the howling wind, we reached the railway station. E"], [48, "RAMSGATE AND MARGATE. III. HE English are a clubbable but not a sociable race. The two words are not synony mous. It may even be said that the club is an anti-sociable institution, and that it has been invented for the sole purpose of securing the members' solitude whilst preserving a semblance of sociability. The club groups together a number of men belonging to the same class, to the same world, having as nearly as possible an equal status. Every member knows that the men who belong to his club are fit and proper persons to associate with him, but it is quite understood that membership in a club does not entitle a man to force his company on his fellow-members. Solitude among the many is the chief aim of club life ; social intercourse ranks second only. The luxury of club life consists, to a great extent, in the pleasure and satisfaction of feeling that one is amongst men of good social position, free from promiscuous intercourse with common people, which, to many, is a real torture. To have found the means of blending the pleasures of solitude with the chief advantages resulting from the organization of society as it now exists among highly civilized nations is to have succeeded in a task which might have been looked upon as impossible to any but the English, who, on the other hand, would never have found the French Utopian formula, Liberty, Equality, Fraternity. The love for solitude, for exclusiveness, which has led the English to invent clubs, has also led them to preserve in their railways the old-fashioned carriages divided into compart ments, as were the coaches of old, and to refuse to adopt the American, the German, or the Swiss railway-carriages, communicating with each other. The same sentiment has been the cause of their retaining that singular regulation according to which private carriages only are allowed to enter the sacred precincts of Hyde Park, a regulation which in many countries less free than England would have been abolished a long time ago or led to no end of disorder, if not to a revolution. A nation so skilful as the English in preserving social distinctions of all kinds could not be expected to swerve from its principles, even in the festive and holiday season, when, by a kind of tacit understanding, people belonging to different classes of society might be supposed to forget their respective ranks. The great lady of Grosvenor Square and Belgravia cannot think without a shudder of bathing in the same sea with the Bond Street milliner, or even the middle-class woman \u2014 at all events in the waters of the United Kingdom. For it is a remarkable fact that when they leave their country, the English become immediately more sociable towards everybody \u2014 their own countrymen and countrywomen of course excepted."], [49, "RAMSGATE AND MARGATE. 27 This sufficiently explains why certain watering-places are frequented solely by people belonging to the \"upper ten,\" whilst others are the meeting-places of the middle classes, and others again of small tradesmen and shopkeepers. And in the case of places which are popular with all classes of the community, the clever device has been resorted to of having two seasons, one for aristocratic visitors and one for vulgarians. Brighton, for instance, is a perfect Belgravia-by-the-Sea in the autumn and winter months ; to become a kind of Bloomsbury or Camden Town-super-Mare during the hot summer months, when society is dining, dancing and flirting in Tjondon, and the people's representatives are holding forth at Westminster. The same thing obtains throughout the country and in all classes. The aristocratic Morning Performance, Eamsoate Sands. classes look down upon the professional men, who look down upon the merchants, who look down upon the tradesmen and clerks, who, in their turn, look down on the working men and women. Ramsgate and Margate are situated at the extreme end of the county of Kent, the former on the south, the latter on the north side of a promontory which advances into the Straits of Dover, and which was originally an island, as the name of Isle of Thanet given to this part of Kent implies. There was, so say the Green Book and the Red Book, a sea passage going from Reculver to Sandwich. At present the Isle of Thanet is no more an island than was the old province called He de France, which comprised the territory enclosed e 2"], [50, "SKETCHES OF ENGLAND. 28 by the Seine, Marne, Oise, Aisne, and Ourcq ; but it is, like the He de France, cut off from the neighbouring districts by a channel and the river Stour. Ramsgate has an unmistakably modern look about it ; there is not in the whole place an old house ; everything is of recent growth, and the better it is for the visitors, for with due respect to the architects of ancient times, their ideas of comfort, as far as we can judge from the splendid, picturesque, and artistic buildings they have left us, were, to say the least of it, of a very imperfect character. There is, however, at Ramsgate a monument which deserves notice. It is a sort of obelisk, which stands on the harbour quay, in front of the Custom House offices. Here is the inscription which can be read on one of the sides of it : \u2014 TO GEORGE THE FOURTH, KING OF GEEAT BEITAIN AND IEELAND, THE INHABITANTS AND VISITOES OF RAMSGATE, and the DIBECTOBS AND TRUSTEES OF THE HARBOUR HAVE ERECTED THIS \u00a9belisfc AS A GRATEFUL RECOED OF HIS GEACIOUS MAJESTY'S CONDESCENSION IN SELECTING THIS PORT FOR HIS EMBARKATION ON THE 25th OF SEPTEMBER IN PROGRESS TO HIS KINGDOM OF HANOVER, AND HIS HAPPY RETURN ON THE 8th OF NOVEMBER, 1821. We have carefully copied this inscription and another one, in Latin, which, for want of space, we cannot reproduce here, because we were much struck by the fawning tone which pervades both these specimens of official platitude. The worthy directors and trustees of the harbour of Ramsgate have, at the first trial, reached the height of absurdity. When the ridiculous soars to such giddy altitudes, it has a touch of the sublime. The Green Book, however, very nearly surpasses even the platitude of the Ramsgate authorities, when it tells us that this massive granite obelisk has been modelled after the pyramidal wonders of Egypt. This is delightful, and a man must have a peculiarly con structed mind who can mention in the same breath the Ramsgate obelisk and the pyramids of Egypt. The town of Ramsgate is remarkably lively, at least so it seems to any one coming from Canterbury. Whether it would seem quite as lively to a traveller fresh from the Continent is another matter. Everything in the world has to be taken relatively ; there is nothing absolutely true, not even those famous principles which we are taught at school to look upon as universally recognised. What is true and indisputable on one side of the Channel is looked upon as a fallacy on the other, whether the channel be the English or the Irish one."], [51, "RAMSGATE AND MARGATE. 29 It may even be said that Ramsgate, always looking upon it from the relative point of view, is pervaded by an unusual and pleasant animation, which is almost boisterous, especially at night, when in and about the High Street, and the quay running round the harbour, the wandering minstrels, niggers, and others, make the air resound with their brass instruments and their nasal voices, singing music-hall ditties and comic songs. Talking of these street singers, no one has ever been able to explain satisfactorily why they deem it necessary to paint their faces black, to put on calico costumes, and to wear closely cropped curly wigs, to sing a silly song about some statesman, or a sillier one about the adventures of a \" masher \" at the \" Zoo.\" But if there is plenty of movement in the streets, there is no amusement of any kind in the way of theatres or concerts, with the excep tion of a travelling circus and a small music-hall, which we did not, how ever, enter. We pre ferred going up and down the High Street, where there is a constant double stream of passers-by, who seem to have come to Eamsgate with the deter mination of enjoying themselves, and not to be baffled in their object. Of course the youthful element predominates largely in the crowd, which is chiefly composed of young men and young An Excursionist. girls, flirting, laughing, talking loud, occasionally indulging in a little horseplay, but with a frankness and an utter dis regard of conventional propriety which is exceedingly refreshing. They seem to be themselves. One may like them or the reverse, but it cannot be denied that there is about the visitors to Ramsgate a genuineness which is altogether wanting in the crowd of well-dressed, but stiff, formal, and disagreeable-looking dummies to be seen at fashionable watering-places. Have you ever seen a stuffed bird or animal by the side of a living one ? However cleverly the bird-stuffer \u2014 or taxidermist, as he prefers being called \u2014 has contrived to give the animal every appearance of life, there is in the stiffness of the limbs, in the forced attitude, something which at once betrays the real state of things. Well, the Ramsgate crowd is living, it is alive; that ofthe places which have the reputation of being fashionable resorts has been"], [52, "SKETCHES OF ENGLAND. 30 stuffed by that great taxidermist, Cant, which has contrived to give the appearance of stuffed animals to living creatures. The very height of art, that ! As in every place we visited in England, the foreigner is conspicuous by his absence. He is only to be met in large towns, where he comes because his business calls him there ; but it seems never to have struck our countrymen that the United Kingdom might be a very pleasant place to come to to spend a summer holiday. Yet, after the intolerable heat of a Paris summer, there are few things more enjoyable than a trip to the fresh and pretty Channel watering-places. Have the Continental people, in their philosophy, never dreamt of England as a holiday resort ? We believe they have, but we also firmly believe that those who came over have been driven away by the reception they met at the hands of British hotel-keepers and id genus omne. Whereas, on the Continent, hotel-keepers in large towns and inn keepers in small country places have taken care to provide and cater for the tastes of English and foreign travellers, their English and Welsh congeners are satisfied that what has been the custom for years and years, and found to answer, cannot possibly be improved upon. They forget, or do not know, how near England and Wales, Scotland and Ireland have been brought to the Continent of Europe through the agency of railways and steamboats, and they do nothing to attract foreign visitors. In one of the places we stopped at, we asked the hotel-keeper if he had had French visitors in his hotel. He told us that he had had two, the year before, but that they could not speak English, whilst he, on the other hand, did not know a word of French ; and that as they were always asking for information they were a great nuisance to him, and he was glad when they went away. He concluded by saying that he did not want any more of them. There you have the English hotel-keeper all over. His only business seems to be to charge as much as he can for bad accommodation and worse food, supplemented with scant civility and obligingness. Don't ask him for information about anything. He does not know, and if he happens to know, he has a manner of imparting it which is as thoroughly unamiable as possible. It is said that English people have a genius for business and commerce. It is so, no doubt, as far as large commercial enterprises and undertakings go, but as to English retail traders and hotel-keepers they cannot hold a candle to the lowest boutiquier or inn-keeper in France or Switzerland. Of the food and accommodation we have already said what we thought : both are vile ; but what shall we say of the extortionate prices charged by English hotels and restaurants ? They are ridiculous if we only consider the total they amount to, but if taken into connec tion with the fare provided, they at once become downright robbery. The English know it very well, and this is why they prefer the Continental holiday resorts where they get good accommodation and excellent wine and food at moderate price, and meet with a civility and engaging manners such as they cannot get at home from the native inn-keeper. This is sufficient to account for their going abroad instead of to the summer resorts of their own country. They go farther, it is true, but they fare much better. So long as this state of things obtains in England, so long will foreigners"], [53, "RAMSGATE AND MARGATE. 31 give English watering and seaside places and picturesque districts as wide a berth as possible. No doubt we have heard English people complaining of the charges made in some Con tinental hotels and restaurants. There are certainly a number of places where the charges are extravagant, especially in places like Paris. But let the English try the corresponding hotels and restaurants in London, and they will see what their bill amounts to at the end of the week. English travellers, when abroad, often go to places such as in their own country they would never dream of going to, and expect to get everything for next to nothing because they have been told that things are cheap on the Continent. A man who would never think of putting up at Claridge's Hotel in London will, on his arrival at Paris, drive to the Hotel Bristol. Of course the result is appalling. But whose fault is it ? There is no doubt that the average hotels in seaside and summer resorts on the Continent are infinitely superior as far a? accommodation and food go to the English average hotels of the same class ; they are, besides, more pleasant, and cheaper to boot. Our experience of an English seaside hotel at Ramsgate is not one that we can look back upon with any great amount of satisfaction. We went to one of the best hotels in the place. One of us had to be content with a room about ten feet by seven, without a table or an arm-chair, and furnished with a bed that no servant would have slept upon, even if any one had had the coolness to provide a servant with a bed of this description. We grumbled, of course, but were met with the (to an English mind) unanswerable reply that Sir Somebody Something had occupied the very same room for several weeks together. English hotel-keepers are to be congratulated on their having customers who are so easily satisfied, and ever ready to pay very dearly for very inferior things ; but they must not expect foreign vulgarians to be so lavish with their money, and so regardless of their own comfort as English baronets and knights. We were not told whether Sir Somebody Something liked the fare provided at the hotel in question, but we certainly did not. The first spoonful of soup which the artist tasted very nearly killed him ; it was a curious compound, half fluid, half solid, but so vigorously peppered and spiced that it fairly took the breath out of him, and he had to drink three or four tumblers of water before he could be restored to a comparatively normal state. When he was informed that the spiciness of the soup was not due to an accident, but, on the contrary, was purposely and deliberately obtained, his astonishment knew no bounds, and he admired and envied the other diners, male and female, whose armour-plated palate and digestive organs enabled them to swallow the fiery concoction without so much as wincing. Of the wine we shall say nothing. We have no vocabulary at our command that would adequately express our opinion of the quality of the liquid served to us under the name of wine. Suffice it to say that it was more than doubtful whether it contained a single drop of the juice of the grape ; but, on the other hand, the price charged for it left nothing to be desired from the point of view of the hotel-keeper's profits, which must be very large indeed. As we stayed in Ramsgate longer perhaps than in any other place in England, with the"], [54, "SKETCHES OF ENGLAND. 32 exception of London, we have a distinct recollection of these facts, which went far towards making clear to us the reason why English country places and seaside resorts are so resolutely tabooed by foreigners. If it were not for that, what a charming place Ramsgate would be to spend a few days at during a summer holiday, for any one fond of the sea ! For it has an excellent sandy beach, stretching along for a considerable distance at the foot of tall white cliffs, where sea bathing can be enjoyed in perfect security ; the climate is pleasant, and not too warm, the heat of the sun being always tempered by a gentle sea-breeze, and in the neighbourhood there are a number of attractive and picturesque spots, to which excursions can be made either on foot or riding or driving, such as Pegwell Bay, which is conveniently reached on foot. This last-mentioned place is famous for shrimps, and the reputation it has acquired in this respect is by no means undeserved ; the shrimps are really excellent. But let us return to Ramsgate and the Ramsgate sands. In a sea-bathing place, whether in England or in any other country, the beach is the spot to which every one repairs. It is the great meeting-place of the visitors, who, coming mostly from towns and cities, have an in ordinate wish to bask in the sun, to roll on the sands, and to remain in the open air, enjoying the view of the sea, the cool breeze, the pure atmosphere, the brilliant light, and the play of the sun's rays on the waves. To the dwellers of the towns there is an inexpressible charm in being near the sea, in hearing its waves breaking with rhythmical sound over sand or shingle, in dreaming, and allowing the mind to wander in a sort of floating reverie, whilst the body, under the influence of the ambient air, is wrapped in a languor which is so thoroughly in harmony with the state of the mind. This condition of intense calm and repose is only to be enjoyed near the sea ; it needs the lulling sound of the waves, recurring with its impressive regularity. In the country the rustling of the leaves, fitful or con tinuous, has a disturbing effect on the mind ; the murmur of the waves, on the contrary, has a soothing influence, to be duly appreciated only by the overworked and jaded inhabitants of populous cities like London or Paris. All these can be enjoyed at Ramsgate, where one can at will mix among the crowd on the beach, near the railway station, or repair to some more secluded spot near or beyond the new pier, although this part of the beach is far from being so pleasant as the other on account of the seaweeds and the rocks emerging from the sand. It is also much narrower. A curious structure, by-the-bye, is this new pier, which for some reason or other is well-nigh deserted ; probably people find it too far from the town. We went there one morning before lunch\u2014 it might be about eleven or twelve o'clock. There was not a soul to be seen with the exception of four musicians who were discoursing sweet music for the benefit of the fishes. We listened for some time to the jingling sound of the piano, the strident notes of the cornet, the grating of the violin and the groaning of the double-bass which composed the band of the new pier, and very soon beat a hasty retreat, but not, however, before noticing the pretty view of the cliffs crowned at that spot by a red-brick house and a wind-mill, and the lovely sea shimmering under the sun rays, with its splendid blue and green reflections. We can heartily recommend the new pier and the neighbouring parts of the beach to those who prefer solitude to the company of men."], [55, "RAMSGATE AND MARGATE. 33 Those who, on the contrary, enjoy the company of men, women in large numbers, and children innumerable, should go to the sands of Ramsgate par excellence, that is, the part of the beach stretching from the East Pier to the end of the esplanade. There, from morning till night, amusements of all kinds are going on amidst the incessant passing to and fro of the bathers, idlers and loungers, the conversation of grown-up people, the joyous exclamations and silvery laughter of the children, the distant strains of the band, the cries of itinerant sellers of toys and sweets, and the occasional shrill noise of the railway whistle, re-echoed by the cliffs behind. Under the eyes of their mothers or nursemaids the pretty children, with fair hair and blue eyes, bronzed by the sea air and the sun, their sturdy limbs exposed to view \u2014 some of them even are without so much as an apology for a garment \u2014 disport themselves on the beach, erecting castles, fortresses, and other constructions of the same kind, or paddling in the puddles or holes left full of water by the receding tide. Here is a little maid of five On the Sands by the Pier, Ramsgate. summers at the outside, putting on her corset with becoming gravity ; there a youthful Briton forgetting or not knowing that Britannia rules the waves, and to all appearance caring very little about it, protests with more energy than success against being dipped into the briny sea, whilst a younger brother looks on with a reproachful air. It is noteworthy that children always seem delighted to take sides against unruly babies and to blame them for doing what they themselves would do with pleasure, however repre hensible or improper. After all, is this to be wondered at ? Children are little men, said Voltaire ; and as there is nothing which men indulge in with greater glee than carping or criticising, children only follow the natural instinct of the human race. Beyond are the bathing machines, drawn by powerful horses, and in the sea, farther still, bathers enjoying an early dip. It is the same thing every day, and yet it is an ever changing sight. The flight of the clouds, chasing each other across space, produces an F"], [56, "SKETCHES OF ENGLAND. 34 endless variety of effects of light and shade over the glimmering water which one is never tired of watching; now a gleam of light, piercing the canopy of clouds, suddenly lights up a dark spot or gives a dazzling appearance to a white sail hitherto unseen ; now the smoke issuing from the funnel of a passing steamer darkens the horizon, to which it gives the aspect of a stormy sky. But bathing is over. After a bath, nothing is more pleasant than to rest on the soft sands. Small groups are formed, umbrellas are unfurled, red, green, white, and afford pro tection against the rays of the sun to the heads of the reclining loungers. Suddenly there is a general movement in the crowd assembled on the beach, people get up hurriedly, cross over to a kind of booth near the band-stand, and return to their seats ; then, as if in response to a given signal, all along the sands immense square pieces of paper are being unfolded, not without some difficulty, as there is a little breeze blowing\u2014 the London papers have just come in, and for a time every other person is deeply engaged in reading the news flashed to the capital during the night from every part of the globe. This, of course, takes some time. English newspapers are twice the size of Continental ones, and contain ten times as much reading matter, not reckoning advertisements, which some people take a delight in perusing. The only amusing thing in the advertising columns are the effusions of lovers, to whom a special corner has been devoted by the considerate editors, who seem to be doing their best to make the course of true love run as smooth as possible, and to give much occupation to the judges, barristers, and solicitors engaged in investigating and deciding matrimonial cases. One reads, for instance* such things as: \u2014 \"B.S.Z. \u2014 Quite alone. M. left, Pray come \" ; which is sufficiently clear to anyone not absolutely stupid ; or again : \u2014 \"ARTHUR. \u2014 You know I love you, my darling. Occasionally misunderstood. You can trust me implicitly. \u2014 Red Rose\"; and a day or two later \"Arthur\" replies to \" Red Rose\" in the most gushing style. Sometimes the ingenuous persons who correspond through the medium of the agony column use ciphers which are always most easy to read. Here is one which we translated in two minutes :\u2014 \" H.P.C.W.\u2014 9.13.16.18.15.22.9.14.7\u2014 4.1.18.12.9.14.7.\u2014 13.21.19.20\u2014 19.5.5\u2014 25.15.21\u2014 19.15.13.5.8.15.23\u2014 22.5.18.25\u2014 21.14. 3.15.13.6.15.18.20.1.2.12.5\u20143.15.14.10.5.19.20.9.15.14\u201415.6\u201412.21.14.7.19\u20141.14.4\u201423. 5.1.11.14.5.19.19 \u2014 18.5.3.5.9.22.5.4\u20141.12.12.\" It simply means : \"Improving, darling; must see you somehow; very uncomfortable; congestion of lungs and weakness ; received all.\" The writer simply numbered the letters in their usual order, and substituted numbers for letters \u2014 a most childish proceeding. We have seen other ciphers, but they were all easy to discover after a few minutes' attention. We had just deciphered the above interesting message when, the papers having been read, people began to show signs of restlessness. They had not long to wait before an ample supply of amusement was provided for them by the numerous musicians, singers, mountebanks, and others whose business it is to entertain visitors. From that moment till nightfall almost, the beach of Ramsgate is like a fair, and assumes that lively appearance which is peculiar to it. The whole extent of the sands is crowded with people wearing the most varied costumes, varied, that is, especially as regards colour, for the shape and cut of"], [57, "RAMSGATE AND MARGATE. 35 the garments is about the same. For women, the lightest and brightest hues are the height of taste and fashion, both in their dresses and their parasols. As to their bonnets and hats, as we have noticed before, they allow themselves the greatest liberty, verging on licence. At Ramsgate the straw hat seemed to be the most popular headgear, and it is, it must be said, the most sensible. This is to be noted, as it will be remembered that each place we visited iu England appeared to have adopted a special kind of coiffure. For men, flannels, lawn-tennis costumes, were a common style of dress, white and red and white and blue being the pre dominant colours. Englishmen do not, as a rule, wear straw hats even at the seaside. They prefer the small peaked cricketing cap, and occasionally only, a boating straw hat with a very bright ribbon. Children \u2014 and Ramsgate is the playground and bathing-place of the majority of the London babies \u2014 are very sensibly, that is summarily, dressed. And what a quantity of them there is at Ramsgate and Margate ! Where do they all come from, and what will become of them all are questions which may well puzzle economists and social reformers. At the rate the English are multiplying, the time seems to be approaching when there will hardly be standing-room for the people of the British Islands. As it is the problem of providing the necessaries of life for an immense population increasing with such rapidity is one which must cause considerable apprehension to the rulers of the country. In time of peace it is no doubt a matter of comparatively easy settlement ; but were England involved in a war with a powerful European nation or with the United States, which is perhaps more likely on the principle that disputes among people of the same family or race are more frequent than among people who are perfect strangers, it would be found a task of the greatest difficulty to provide an adequate supply of food for the inhabitants. It is not generally known, perhaps, how largely dependent upon foreign countries the English are for their food supplies. The amount of imported food per head of the population is above three pounds per annum in value. As prices have gone down considerably during the last few years the amount in quantity must be enormous. Yet with these facts staring them in the face, the English object to the Channel Tunnel, which might, in given circumstances, be worth to them more than a whole fleet or an army twice as numerous as their present one. Another question which forcibly appeals to the mind when seeing the enormous crowd of people in a comparatively small place like Ramsgate, is, where do they all go at night ? where do they find a shelter ? where are they stowed away ? We use the words stowed away advisedly, for it expresses the exact state of things, if we are to believe what was said to us by a waiter in the hotel. We asked him this question, and he replied : \" People who have a house let the greater part of it to visitors ; people who have only two rooms let one, and those who have only one room let half of it.\" As he himself had a small house, the greater part of which he used to let during the summer months, we were led to the conclusion that he spoke the truth. Besides, this is the only way to account for so many people being able to stay in the place at one and the same time. The fact is that people live in the open air, and only require a place to sleep in, not caring how cramped and uncomfortable they are at night. That is all very well when the weather is fine ; but what when it is wet ? Probably it is at Ramsgate as f2"], [58, "SKETCHES OF ENGLAND. 36 at Boulogne, where we once happened to spend several weeks. The weather was splendid, and the town was filled to overflowing ; the hotel and lodging-house keepers were as happy and as proud as they know how to be when business is brisk, and contemptuously turned a deaf ear to the entreaties of new-comers begging for a room, a bed, a place on a billiard table, or even a single meal. Suddenly there came an unforeseen change ; the weather became rainy and boisterous. A gale of wind blew over the town for three or four days. On the evening of the second day Boulogne was as empty as it is in November. Everybody had left. However, whilst we were at Ramsgate the weather was fine in the English sense of the word. We have just said that the weather was fine in the English sense of the word. To the untravelled and unsophisticated reader, this may sound like an absurd proposition, for it may be reasonably supposed that fine weather is fine weather all the world over. All the world over perhaps, but an exception must be made for the British Isles. The weather is considered fine by the English so long as it does not rain. If the wind blows with violence enough to tear the horns off the heads of the bulls, as the French saying has it, they say it is bracing ; if it is overcast, foggy, dark to the point of necessitating the use of lamps or gas in the middle of the day, they call it a little dull, and so on. When you go into a shop on a dark day, the shopkeeper or his assistant, whilst you are fumbling in your pocket to pay his account, will break out suddenly with, \" Fine day, sir.\" You, of course, believe he is joking, and lift up your head with a smile at the idea of having met with a humorous shopkeeper ; but when your eyes meet his, his stolid countenance at once tells you that he is in earnest ; he looks as serious as the Pope himself ; he means it. It has not rained, therefore the day is fine. Well, during our stay at Ramsgate the weather was fine, and the open air amusements which are commonly found in seaside places in England were in full swing. All day long there was something going on. In the morning there is a brass band, not very numerous, but every instrumentalist of which makes as much noise as four other average players. This is the ordinary band to be found everywhere. Very soon after, the \" Punch and Judy \" man comes upon the scene, to the intense delight of children, who rush to him as soon as they hear the sound of his reed-pipe. Then the performance begins amid the bright laughter of the youthful audience with fair complexions and gleaming eyes. A critical audience, too, for there is a certain competition between \"Punch and Judy\" shows, and there was one man who cer tainly had always a much greater number of patrons than his competitors. We wrere unable to ascertain what this one man's particular attraction was, but the fact we noticed over and over again. Did his \"Punch\" strike harder than any other? Was his nose more rubicund ? were his sallies funnier ? was \" Judy \" more laughable or \" Toby \" more dignified ? were the costumes prettier or the scenery more elaborate and brilliant ? We could not tell ; but the man's success was undoubted. During the performance we noticed on the \"Punch and Judy\" theatre the following inscription : Schools attended to by X. As soon as Punch has retired behind the scenes, the man packs up his portable theatre and some other attraction is provided a little distance off. For there is a sort of tacit under standing among these men, who arrange to run their shows in succession. Here are clowns"], [59, "RAMSGATE AND MARGATE. 37 spreading strips of carpet on which they are going to roll over, turn summersaults, and per form feats of agility, strength or daring. A tiny little boy will soon be twisted by them into the most outrageous postures ; the little fellow must be made of indiarubber, for he under goes this kind of torture without apparently being any the worse for it. An Italian, with an accordion and a monkey peeping under his coat, looks on and seems rather disgusted to see a rival show doing so well. Why, his monkey could do tricks ten times more remarkable than those the little boy can ever hope to accomplish ; but people prefer to look at a child, and he moves on with unconcealed bad humour. A little further, a broken-down old man is juggling with balls and bottles and what not, whilst within a few yards a curious-looking individual in a dilapidated coat performs card tricks. But all these entertainers are eclipsed by the four nigger minstrels who, punctual to the minute, make their ap pearance at the same hour every day. The nigger min strels are quite a national institution and seem to be immensely popular with people of all age, sex, and condition \u2014 at the seaside. They do not appeal to children only, but to then parents as well. Nor can it be said that their popularity is altogether undeserved. Their blackened faces and hands, their red lips and eyes, their rusty black dress coats and equally rusty black tall A Family Party. hats, their striped linen trousers, are not particularly original or pretty, their nasal twang and squeaky voices are certainly not pleasant to hear, nor is the sound of the banjo a very har monious one ; yet there is something in their antics which evidently attracts the crowd. They sing the latest comic song, the newest topical absurdity, and play the most popular tunes, their sallies are laughable, they make a lavish use of the catchword of the day and indulge in political or other allusions with a rough and vulgar, but ready wit. Certainly these allusions were not always intelligible to us, but we could see by the merriment they created and the laughter they provoked that they knew how to tickle the popular fancy. A fat man in white flannel appeared to be the favourite comic singer of the lot. He strutted up and down as he sang, and made grimaces which were highly appreciated. Whilst he was delivering a song about some statesman who had fallen into difficulties, one of the banjo players went round to collect money, and saw the artist busily sketching the scene. He immediately came up to him and examined his sketches with a critical and friendly air. He was very anxious to know"], [60, "SKETCHES OF ENGLAND. 38 whether the sketches were for Moonshine or the Graphic, and when they would be published. Of course the artist \u2014 who did not understand \u2014 made no reply, and the minstrel was some what dissatisfied at not obtaining an answer, when the scribe explained as well as he could that the sketches were not intended for either the Graphic or Moonshine, but for an illustrated magazine. Thereupon our nigger friend at once requested us not to forget to mention the name of his company. \" Don't forget, sir,\" he said, \" don't forget Baby's band, sir; that's right, sir, Baby's band,\" and accordingly out came the note-book and down was the name of the band written, in remembrance of the few moments our nigger friends helped us to while away at Ramsgate. Lunch-time, of course, makes a sort of entr'acte to the various performances, concerts, exhibitions and variety shows, and again we ask, where do all the people go ? It is per fectly wonderful. In a few minutes the whole beach is empty ; for some time the streets are full, everybody going towards the higher part of the town, and then all is quiet again, and passers-by are few and far between. Ramsgate is at table. The day is divided into three parts, each preceded by a meal ; the first extends from break fast to lunch, the second from lunch to dinner, and the third from dinner to bed-time, the last mentioned a most uncertain hour, but at Ramsgate a very late one, as far as young people and adults are concerned. As a matter of course children are never seen out of doors after dinner. The English, at all events, as much as we could judge, have not taken to that most senseless custom of children's balls at seaside places, and they are to be congratu lated, for there are few things more objectionable from every point of view than those parties from which children come home tired when they are not actually ill from excitement and over-fatigue. Of the three divisions of the day, the first is the most lively ; people are fresh from their morning bath, the temperature is cooler, and the chief open-air amusements are provided during that time. The afternoon is reserved for excursions by sea or land, for walks in the neigh bourhood, for paying calls, shopping, and tea-parties. The itinerant photographers, of whom there are many on the sands, seem also to be driving a brisk trade during the latter part of the day. The display of portraits they exhibit on their movable studios is extremely interesting, and we were very desirous of forming a collection of them ; but we found it a difficult thing to do. An album composed of these portraits would be one of the most comic things ever seen. A great number of them represent engaged couples in the most loving and spooning attitudes, and, as everybody knows, young people in such circumstances look very interesting, no doubt, 'but, it must be acknowledged, intensely foolish also. Among the occupations to which people devote themselves at the seaside in general, and at Ramsgate in particular, there are two we have not yet mentioned, because they are indulged in at all times, morning, noon, and night, and that is novel reading and love making, especially the latter. To understand to what length flirtation, billing and cooing, spooning and other amatory pastimes can go, we must come to England. In this respect, Ramsgate and, for that matter Margate also, are the most English of places. And what curious and, at the same time, free \u2014 not to say bold \u2014 manners your English lovers have ! good heavens ! It is said that people who"], [61, "RAMSGATE AND MARGATE. 39 are in love forget everything and think of nothing but their feelings. It certainly seems as if they did forget everything, even to the most elementary notions of propriety, and if we are to infer from it that they are deeply and truly in love, the intensity of their emotions must be truly wonderful. The easy way and positively touching abandon with which they behave themselves must be seen to be believed, and are enough to upset entirely one's ideas as to English notions of decorum. More than once, on seeing loving couples on the sands or on benches, we have been shocked, although far from squeamish, and almost felt inclined to ask them whether we should retire, and leave them to the undisturbed enjoyment of the place. There can be no doubt that on this point, British freedom seems to be carried to excess ; courtship is a very good thing in itself, but like many other things, it is apt to be intolerable when it is practised publicly and with such utter disregard for other people's feelings and sense of decency. The unblushing coolness with which British swains and maidens openly give full scope to the exuberance of their love is another proof of that constitutional and national inability of English people to remain within the limits of that golden mean which should be in all things. They always go from one extreme to another, and often combine the extremes without even suspecting the possibility of a middle course. They are in some respects pru dish to an astonishing degree, in their language, their books, their newspapers, their pictures and illustrations of weekly journals, and yet they allow people to behave in public places in such a way that, if a correct representation of the scenes one sees at every street corner were published in a public print, they would raise an outcry such as has rarely been heard. Another peculiarity of the loving couples to be seen in England is equally remarkable, but altogether unobjectionable, although very curious. You see them going about for miles without saying a word, or sitting for hours in mute contemplation. Very often the young lady reads a novel whilst her male companion smokes his pipe, gazing vacantly at the sea or, as often as not, at nothing in particular, or again playing with his stick, with which he draws on the sand or pegs away at the pebbles.^* At Ramsgate we had the privilege of being introduced to that interesting person the English have nicknamed 'Arry, and his mate. 'Arry is an indigenous product of the soil. He is not a working man, nor a clerk, but a cross between the two ; he appears to belong to the small shopkeeping class or to the class of the men who work at home at some trade, such as tailoring, artificial flowers or card-box making and such like, and are to some extent more independent and more blessed with worldly goods than clerks. 'Arry talks loud, laughs boisterously, cracks jokes with more spirit than taste or discretion, smokes big cigars, and dresses in a singularly showy manner. His worthy spouse, 'Arriett, is quite as talkative, noisy and jocular. She displays an inordinate quantity of jewellery, real or false, has more than the average quantity of feathers on her headgear, sports gaudy dresses of bright hues, gorgeous parasols, and ill-made boots, with ridiculously high heels and white stitches in the shape of flowers or ornaments. The two, as the French saying has it, make a pair. In other words, they are well matched. 'Arry and 'Arriett are not agreeable travelling companions"], [62, "SKETCHES OF ENGLAND. 40 in a railway carriage or on an excursion steamer, or in a public room in hotel or restaurant, but in the open air they are not much more objectionable than a street organ. We will even go so far as to say that they are rather a welcome change from the dull looking majority of people one meets. Whatever their defects may be, they have one great quality, and that is, they are alive, very much alive, and they are at least natural. Their exuberance is great but not offensive, and, moreover, it strikes an original note in a monotonous picture. We certainly prefer 'Arry and 'Arriett, good-natured as they are, to the contemptible stuck-up individuals whose superiority over them does not consist in intelligence, but simply in their having a better tailor and a longer purse, things that go a long way nowadays, and a longer way certainly than they ought to go. Fortunately there is but a sprinkling of that kind of people at Ramsgate. But there is another kind of nuisance still more objectionable, and that is the street preacher. The street-preacher does not only talk contemptible nonsense, he does not only make a place hideous with his drawling utterance and worse attempts at singing, he does not only make religion ridiculous by his travesty of things sacred ; he is, besides, an obstruction to public traffic, he blocks up the roadway and, as an unmitigated nuisance, ought to be removed wherever he is found. He is on a par with the socialist orator. Psalm singing, preaching, and socialist ranting are all very well in their way, provided they are indulged in at the proper time and place, but it is quite as unpleasant to be called a robber by the socialist as a sinner by the preacher. To be denounced on the one hand as an infamous capitalist fit for the guillotine, and on the other as a miserable being destined to everlasting torment, is not what one expects when out for a holiday or for a little rest at the seaside. From a somewhat close study ofthe subject, it seems to us that the English police authori- ties have a certain sneaking regard for the street preacher, who obtains an unfair advantage over the other nuisance, the street socialist orator. As both are equally objectionable, they should be treated on an equal footing. In London, this difference in treatment appeared very noticeable ; at Ramsgate we fortunately saw little of the ranting social reformer on scientific principles, but we were treated to endless psalms, songs and sermons by the preacher and his crew. There they were in daytime and at night. In the dark the scene on the sands was a curious one. Under a large black umbrella stood a white-bearded old man of venerable appearance by the side of an organ placed on a low truck with wheels so as to be easily moved from place to place. Near him was the preacher, a younger man of about thirty, in a rusty black coat, with the blue ribbon in his button-hole. With bare head, and arms moving about like a railway signal, he was holding forth, in a loud key, occasionally lowering his voice so as to give it a more impressive sound. At times he got excited, pivoted on his heels, turning now to the right and now to the left, bringing down his right hand into the left palm, with a loud slap, and cleaving the air with a jerky move- ment very regular and mechanical. Grouped around were a score or two of people mostly young men and women of the humbler classes, listening with apparent attention to the speech of the preacher who gradually waxed more excited. On closer examination by the light of"], [63, "RAMSGATE AND MARGATE. 41 the lantern swinging above the organ, the physiognomies of the listeners assumed a kind of vacant sleepy look ; they did not appear interested in what the preacher said, and yet they were kept motionless by an inexplicable attraction exercised over them by the man's hysterical efforts. Probably the same influence operates on people who, in the great thoroughfares of London, stand gaping before a man who dispenses wondrous pills, ointments and beverages which are to cure all illnesses, or sells some equally marvellous preparations for gilding metal or mending glass. Whilst the preaching goes on, the old man looks round, and when he thinks the time has arrived to throw a little variety into the proceedings, he makes a sign. A woman, hitherto mi^ed among the listeners, comes forward and takes her seat on a stool before the organ. The preacher stops and puts on his hat. \"Number 23,\" says the old gentleman ; the woman sounds a few chords on her instrument, the venerable white-bearded manager of the performance begins to sing a song of which the burden, taken up in chorus by the bystanders, is, \" I've been redeemed \u2014 \" They sing in a plaintive tone, with curiously nasal and colourless voices, \u2014 a depressing sight and a distressing noise. We have enough of it, and we wend our way towards the pier \u2014 not the new pier, where dancing occasionally goes on at night, the dancers being young people of doubtful distinction and free and easy manners, but of undoubted propriety \u2014 but to the old pier, or rather the east wall of the harbour, which is the favourite walking ground of the visitors on fine evenings. At the extreme end of this pier there is a watch-house, and a signal light on a kind of circular platform. From this point, on a moonlight night, the view over the sea is very fine and, on the land side, the town of Ramsgate is seen to much advantage, as it rises in tiers over the harbour. In the centre of the town springs the steeple of the church, towering above the buildings of the sleeping city. To the right, in the direction of the east, extend the long rows of gas lights on the esplanade, and above, on the Granville cliffs, the lighted windows of the Granville Hotel. The land lights reflected in the sea, as bright under the moon's rays as a sheet of polished metal, look like a string of diamonds encircling a silver mirror. Margate is very similar to Ramsgate, but less homely, perhaps less unassuming, than the sister town. The beach is, to our mind, far from being so good. Margate is also a very proper place, and the authorities are remarkably prudish ; their regulations as to bathing are as strict as those of the worthy burgesses of Llandudno, as testified by the notices to be found near the sea, by which we are informed that any person of the male sex above 12 is not allowed to bathe within ten yards of the place where persons of the other sex are bathing, and persons of the fair sex are also forbidden to disport themselves within thirty feet of the male bathers. Why is it proper to bathe within ten yards, and not within nine of a person of the other sex ? Why those absurd regulations ? Are Englishmen and Englishwomen such improper beings that they cannot be allowed to be near each other without danger ; and, if they are, is ten yards a sufficient distance to remove all suspicion of impropriety ? Then comes another notice : \" Male and female persons are expected to wear suitable drawers or gowns sufficient to prevent indecent exposure of the person.\" G"], [64, "SKETCHES OF ENGLAND. 42 In this respect it is to be noted that English women at the seaside wear bathing gowns and costumes which are certainly very proper, as far as their shape goes, but that the mate rials these gowns are made of are remarkably inappropriate, and that, taking this circumstance into consideration, the \" Borough of Margate \" might have extended the separation zone to a hundred yards instead often. Ten yards is too much or too little, and the more radical Welsh authorities who do not allow persons ofthe male sex to walk on the beach when ladies are bathing are at least consistent. It seemed to us that the Margate people have been trying to make a concession to the canting propensities of a notable portion of the community, and that they have succeeded in making themselves very ridiculous. From another point of view, this constantly recurring suspicion of impropriety on the part of everybody and about everything, anything, and nothing becomes intolerable, and has about it a most unpleasant touch of suggestiveness to people who are not accustomed to be reminded at every moment of their wicked and unworthy nature. The people who frequent this watering-place are very much of the same class as visitors to Ramsgate. As in the latter place, there is a very large sprinkling of Jews among them. They are very noticeable, as English Jews have retained to a very marked degree all the characteristics of their race. Some of the women we saw, espt cially the younger ones, were very handsome, and not a few were perfect specimens of oriei tal beauty. Men and women dress showily and display, as is their wont, rather more jewellery and diamonds than necessary, but their demeanour is even more striking than their appearance. They are certainly distin guishable from the Anglo-Saxons on account of their more lively manners ; they seem to be enjoying themselves and are not ashamed to let people see that they do ; they talk and laugh among themselves, and do not take their pleasure sadly. The pier is an elaborate affair where the lady visitors come to show off their summer toilets. The young girls wear light and gay-coloured linen dresses which they trim with velvet and plush, a most extraordinary combination ; but they are utterly indifferent to this incongruous arrangement, which is general. They also seem to have a great partiality for sailors' peaked caps, blue or white, ornamented with gold braid and anchors, a very unbecoming headdress, because in most cases it involves cutting the hair short. This barbarous custom is less excusable in English girls than in girls of any other country, for nowhere is such beautiful golden hair to be seen, and the shearing of their lovely fair tresses is little short of a crime. Really, Englishwomen, for whom nature has done so much, display a want of taste and an inventiveness to destroy their natural good looks which are positively dis tressing. It says much for nature's lavishness towards them, that in spite of all their efforts they do not wholly succeed in making themselves hideous with their eccentricities in dress. There is a good deal of novel and newspaper reading going on at Margate pier between eleven in the forenoon and one. Men, women, and even children are sitting on the benches huddled up together on the leeside (there is a stiff breeze blowing at the time, the famous \" bracing wind \" ofthe English), swaddled in coats, mackintoshes, ulsters, shawls, rugs, and all kinds of wraps, and reading away as if they were learning by heart their novels and news paper articles. Whilst they are thus occupied, the band of the East Kent Militia is playing a"], [65, "RAMSGATE AND MARGATE. 43 selection of the most popular tunes of the Mikado. This band is composed of small boys and of very stout elderly men, who are blowing into their brass instruments with great determi nation. From the bandstand we go round to the refreshment room in the hope of obtaining a luncheon. We had left Ramsgate early in the morning, and felt hungry. The refreshment room was a draughty apartment in the centre of which was a bar. Behind the bar were the usual young ladies, one of whom was surveying the scene, whilst the other was knitting from behind an enormous piece of cold roast beef. Both were the object of much attention on the part of two young men in large check suits with elaborate scarves and a considerable display of jewellery. The pair were smoking very big cigars and burst out in loud laughter now and then. We had some difficulty in getting the young ladies to relinquish for one moment their (no doubt very interesting) conversa tion with their two male Margate Jetty. interlocutors, and to give the necessary orders for our being attended to. Whilst we were having a lunch the frugality of which was rendered compulsory by the unappetising viands spread before us, we had the pleasure to witness a sight altogether new to us, and which probably could only be met with in Eng land. At a small table opposite to us, four young fellows of the unmistakable 'Arry type, well-pomaded hair, blazing neckties, large check summer suits of very light colour heavy watch chains, big rings, stick in hand, pipe and all, were drinking champagne out of tumblers. Drinking champagne out of tumblers in the middle of the day ! This was something we had never seen before, and which, we are bound to say, is not to be seen anywhere except at an g2"], [66, "SKETCHES OF ENGLAND. 44 English seaside place. There they were, the whole four of them, smoking and drinking away, apparently enjoying their extraordinary libation, and probably thinking they were doing the right thing. As a matter of course, the waiters were most attentive to them, as well they might be to customers of so unusual a type, who spent money so lavishly and, shall we add, so stupidly. For a long time we looked at the four champagne drinkers, who entertained us a good deal more than the amusement provided at a singular establishment of local repute, combining the attractions of a music-hall with those of a \"moral\" show, as an American humourist would say, in the shape of a zoological garden. After duly paying the entrance-money, we found ourselves in a long hall, at the end of which was a stage of the ordinary type. The decoration of the place consisted chiefly in rudimentary paintings representing animals in which crude tones of green, blue, and yellow pre dominated. These harmoniously accorded with a kind of dado of silver paper on which were designed arabesques in red. A peculiar feature of this place was the manner in which it was illuminated, the body of the hall being lighted with gas, whilst the stage was lighted by the rays of the sun \u2014 an arrangement which we thought novel and worth being recorded in our note-books. The entertainment comprised the ubiquitous niggers, a troupe of acrobats, and singers, chiefly belonging to the fair sex. We have a very clear recol lection of a young lady dressed in a white dress, the very short skirt of which was ornamented with red moons of a very artistic effect; a pair of black gloves and black stockings and shoes completed this tasteful costume, the details of which we duly noted. As to the song, we did not pay much attention to it. It was of the ordinary kind, neither more nor less silly than such efforts generally are, and, having had enough of the indoor amusements, we proceeded to the zoological gardens, where we saw some very remarkable things, a complete list of which would be too long, and take up more spaca than we feel justified in giving to the subject. Let us, however, mention, among some of the chief curiosities of the place, a zinc heron perched on a rock in the middle of a basin. This heron's wings were full of holes, from which the water escaped in slender jets, instead of issuing from its beak, as originally con templated, owing to something being wrong with the internal pipes, conduits, and general arrangement of the bird. Another curious sight was a cage in which a melancholy stag was confined. In order, no doubt, to assuage the animal's sorrow and to remind him as much as possible of his native moor and forest, the considerate genius presiding over the garden had called in the stage-painter's aid. The latter had willingly lent his assistance to the former's laudable and humane projects, and, with the help of a carpenter, had constructed some wood and canvas rocks, with a stage-landscape in the background. The rock had been rent by the stag's antlers and hung lamentably, occasionally shaken by the wind, and more often by the stag itself giving it a playful prod, and ripping it open. The rock had thus become a kind of drapery and the whole thing was very original. More miserable even than the stag were two eagles we saw in a neighbouring cage, but we had not the courage to look at these poor birds' wretchedness, and we left this place of entertainment a little sadder than we had entered it."], [67, "RAMSGATE AND MARGATE. 45 These appeared to us the only characteristic features which distinguished Margate from Ramsgate, for as regards the class of bathers, visitors, ar. d tourists, the two towns are as like one another as it is well possible to be, and it is easy to understand why Ramsgate and Margate are spoken of together and why their two names are almost as inseparable as those of Punch and Judy and Darby and Joan, to mention only well-known couples who have, it must be admitted, some connection with the twin watering-places of the Isle of Thanet. Minstrels at Margate."], [68, "CHAPTER IV. CHATHAM AND ROCHESTER. UDA and Pest, in Hungary, Beaucaire and Tarascon, in France, Newcastle-on-Tyne and Gateshead, and Liverpool and Birkenhead, in England, are so many geographi- <^mu^& cal Siamese twins, united either by a tunnel, as in the two last-mentioned towns, or by a bridge, as in all the other named cities, and it is easy to know exactly where one happens to be at a given moment when visiting these places ; but Chatham and Rochester, or Rochester and Chatham, are a topographical puzzle of the first magnitude. It is very difficult \u2014 at all events we gave it up \u2014 to ascertain where the one ends and the other begins, for the same High Street runs through both Chatham and Rochester, which are thus skewered together without any gap or interval between them. They are very animated and busy, the streets, or rather the street, being the scene of constant movement and continuous traffic, and thronged by a motley crowd of civilians and military, sailors and soldiers in uniform, dockyard labourers, and railway guards and porters all rushing to and fro, backwards and forwards, as if the fate of the empire depended on the exertion of every individual man. And yet there is on the countenance of all a satisfied and contented air most pleasant to see. At night the numerous public-houses and taverns are ablaze with the crude light of innumerable gas jets, and from the half-open door of every one of them issue forth merry bursts of laughter and the strains of musical instruments accompanying the sentimental or comic words of popular songs. The places of amusement are crowded with soldiers and sailors, who seem to get on admirably together, and form a very enthusiastic audience, applauding, cheering, and stamping their feet with delight, and giving vent to their feelings in the most boisterous and withal good-humoured manner. Altogether, by day or night, thanks to the presence of the military and naval element, Chatham and Rochester are very lively and animated places, much more so than Dover and Canterbury, to which, and especially the latter, they form a striking and welcome contrast. If from the street we turn to the Medway an equally animated scene meets the eye. The river is covered with craft of all descriptions, sailing-boats and steamers, tugs and heavily laden barges, ferry-boats and yachts going up or down the river, discharging or taking in cargo, or embarking and disembarking passengers starting on business expeditions or on pleasure trips. From the dockyards, workshops, and wharves a deafening noise is heard, even when no one is to be seen, and all around tall chimneys rise into the air, vomiting clouds of smoke and steam, which hover above the town and mingle with the clouds, all giving"], [69, "CHATHAM AND ROCHESTER. 47 unmistakable signs of human energy, industry, and activity being at work in the twin cities on the Medway. From the banks of the river in Rochester there is a beautifully picturesque view of the Medway and the surrounding towns. In the foreground is the broad expanse of water, where in mid-stream heavy merchantmen are taking in their supply of coal, brought to them in barges moored alongside, and small boats with red sails, standing out on the bluish sky, lightly veiled by that peculiar and characteristic haze which softens the outlines and blends the colours in the most harmonious manner, glide on the mirror-like surface of the river, in which are reflected the rays of the sun ; to the right the red brick houses of Chatham rise in A Bye-Path, Chatham. rows one above the other on the hill crested with clumps of trees, forming a curtain of foliage ; in front the verdant heights of Brompton are crowned by forts, and show the deep red gashes made in their sides by the working of the sand-pits ; a little further, in the same direction, stands New Brompton, and at the foot of the hills the black sheds and buildings of the dockyard extend in long dark lines, and are dominated by tall chimneys, from which the smoke issues slowly, leisurely one would almost say. In the background an undulating circle of hills shuts in the horizon, and a few windmills spread out their sails, which look in the distance like large white stars on the blue sky. Behind is Rochester. Above the houses of the town the cathedral and the castle, defying"], [70, "SKETCHES OF ENGLAND. 48 time, tower high into the air ; these relics of former ages seem to look down contemptuously on the surrounding signs of modern progress\u2014 steamers, railways, electricity, .... The Rochester end of the High Street\u2014 it is as well to be cautious when one does not exactly know in which of the Medway twins places referred to stand\u2014 the Rochester end of the High Street, then, is more picturesque than the other. On both sides small alleys branch off, climbing up the hill or sloping towards the river. One of the latter, called Willow's Alley, is reached by a flight of narrow steps built under the overhanging wall of a house, and with so little headway that a man of ordinary stature must perforce stoop when going up or down. Every now and then a picturesque old house bulges out into the street and over the pavement, whilst its gables seem to rend a piece off the sky which they sharply indent. A curious old house is Richard Watts' s Hospital, founded in 1579 (and rebuilt in 1771), on which an inscription says, \" Six poor travellers may receive here lodging, entertainment, and four pence each for one night, provided they be not rogues nor proctors.\" Worthy old Watts was evidently not particularly fond of proctors, a kind of attorneys, and small blame to him. Proctors and attorneys have disappeared, but they have been disadvantageous^ replaced by solicitors. For the unfortunate litigants this change implies jumping from the frying-pan into the fire, one race being about as grasping as the other. Watts's antipathy for the lawyers of his time is fully intelligible if one is to credit the stories currently told about the doings of solicitors, and the reprehensible practices they are said to indulge in. Concerning the members of this profession, there are indisputable facts : in the first instance, when travelling in the country, one need not ask to whom belongs the best and most comfortable looking house in a small town or village, for it invariably is the residence of the local solicitor ; and in the second place, when an Englishman is consulted by a friend as to what should be done in some litigation, he, ninety -nine times out of a hundred, advises an amicable settlement, failing which, as a last resource, he suggests that the matter should be referred to a \"respectable\" solicitor. It is to be noticed that an Englishman rarely, if ever, uses the word solicitor without feeling the necessity of qualifying it by the adjective respectable. Another very handsome specimen of the architecture of the sixteenth century is Eastgate House, a two-gabled building with sculptured woodwork, flanked by a turret, and lighted by quaint windows, containing innumerable small panes of glass set in lead, which is now used as a kind of working men's club or institute. It is covered with ivy, and stands in a garden with fine trees, whose foliage shelters the old walls under their shadow. We must also mention a low house, also situated in the High Street, opposite College Gate, and now occupied by a fruiterer, the curious window-frames of which, in sculptured wood painted red, are worth seeing, as an example of naive decoration. Rochester possesses a very fine cathedral, dedicated to St. Andrew, erected in the twelfth and partly reconstructed in the thirteenth century. It is chiefly in the Norman style of architecture, but some parts of it are Early English. The principal or west front has a remarkable Roman door, ornamented with beautifully-carved figures, under which the nave is entered. The nave itself is Norman, and the open timber roof is supported"], [71, ""], [72, ""], [73, "THE CASTLE GAIiDENS, ROCHESTER"], [74, ""], [75, "CHATHAM AND ROCHESTER. 49 by two rows of massive pillars adorned with zigzag and diaper mouldings, above which are double arches of the same style. The large pillars of the Early English pointed arches at the east end of the nave are flanked by slender shafts of Purbeck marble \u2014 a very tasteful combination. The choir, restored at different times, and as lately as 1875, is, like that of Canterbury, much higher than the nave. It is partly paved with tiles of a very effective design, copied from old tiles discovered in the crypt, and consisting of circles so arranged as to show a Maltese cross. There is to be seen on the wall a very interesting fragment of mural painting, but it is not in a sufficient state of preservation to allow an opinion to be formed as to the subject represented, wdiich is said, however, to have been the \"Wheel of Fortune.\" On the contrary, the colouring of the effigy on the monument of Bishop John de Sheppey is as perfect as any specimen of painting of the same period (fourteenth century) to be found anywhere. It had been bricked up for centuries, and was only brought to light in 1825, and this, possibly, may account for its present condition. The bishop's robes are richly coloured, and some of the ornaments are studded with various stones. An iron railing of the same date as the tomb surrounds this monument, the most remarkable in the cathedral. A very fine door leads from the choir into the chapter-house. It dates from the four teenth century, and is an admirable specimen of the sculptor's art of that period. Having been restored some fifty years ago, the whole of the composition can be seen at a glance, and the details are at once apparent. The principal figures in it are, it is said, the Christian Church and the Jewish, the former standing erect, the latter leaning on a broken reed. But as one of the figures represents a man, and the other a woman, the interpretation popularly given of this sculpture seems at least doubtful. Be that as it may, there is no doubt as to the beauty and excellence of the work. Despite its small proportions, the cathedral of Rochester is certainly a very beautiful monument, and one which contains most interesting specimens of Norman architecture and ornamentation. It is light and, notwithstanding the absence of stained glass in the windows, has not the cold and naked appearance of larger churches. It leaves on the mind a pleasant and lasting impression, even after Canterbury, owing perhaps, in some degree, to the fact that one is not so entirely in the intolerable power of the vergers, who seem to do their best to drive visitors from the religious buildings confided to their care. True, application to the \" proper authorities\" might possibly enable one to wander at random in these monuments ; but why should such a step be necessary ? Why should cathedrals, churches, chapels, and places of worship in general be closed to the public? The naves, or those parts of religious edifices where there is nothing or very little to see, are indeed open, but the most interesting portions are carefully hidden from the gaze of ordinary mortals. Is that the way to attract worshippers ? We do not mean the official worshippers, who come on official days at official hours, but the really afflicted or sorrowful, who, yearning for divine help or consolation, would give the world to be allowed to kneel and pray when in distress and affliction, not at stated days or hours. Again, why should the art treasures in churches be closed against the student as they H"], [76, "SKETCHES OF ENGLAND. 50 practically are now ? In this age of lukewarm faith and of indifferent architectural art, the closing of churches, from the religious as well as from the artistic point of view, is a sad mistake and a very short-sighted policy. The crypt, extending under the choir, strikes one as being small ; the massive pillars and circular arches point to a Norman origin, although some portions appear to be of a later date ; it is, however, not very remarkable, and contains no monuments, but only some remains of mural paintings. The exterior appearance of the cathedral on the north side is rather fine, the square tower, called Gundulf's Tower, being a curious feature of the edifice. The central tower is modern, and the two western towers, crowned by pepper-boxes of questionable taste, all detract from the aspect of this venerable pile. Within a stone's throw of the cathedral rises the castle. Rochester Castle, the old fortress of Odo of Bayeux, Earl of Kent, is now a ruin, but a most interesting and picturesque one. It stands at the south-west extremity of the town, on the banks of the Medway, and was at one time surrounded on three other sides by a deep moat. There are few examples of ancient military architecture so well calculated to give a correct idea of what were the strongholds of our forefathers. The Norman keep of Rochester, seen from the outside, even now looks formidable enough, with its massive embattled walls one hundred feet high, supported by four square buttress towers, one at each angle, rising about twenty-five feet above the central structure ; but on nearer examination the effect of time becomes discernible, the yawning windows disclose the ruined state of the interior, now roofless, through which the sky is seen, and the fine mantle of ivy thrown over the grey walls is not sufficient to hide their dilapidated condition. Access is gained to the ruins by a prettily-laid public garden, in which a prodigious number of pigeons disport themselves, to the delight of the children who play in the grounds. Tlie birds have grown so familiar as to eat in the hands of the visitors who frequent the gardens the proffered morsel of bread or grain of corn ; sometimes, however, suddenly frightened, they take their flight with a hasty flutter, and seek refuge in the holes in the walls of the keep. A gate leads to the interior of the keep, whose vast proportions and arrangements are seen at a glance. Originally composed of three storeys, as evidenced by the holes in the walls where the joists were placed which supported the flooring, the keep was divided from top to bottom by a central wall which still exists. A hollow shaft passes through this wall connect ing the upper storeys with the deep wrell. On the second storey the central partition is open, and three massive pillars, forming four beautiful circular arches, support the upper portion of the wall. A staircase runs to the top of the tower, which is easily accessible, and from the battlements there is a beautiful view of the cathedral, the towns of Rochester and Chatham, the Medway, and the surrounding country, the horizon being bounded by the hills. The general impression left on the mind after a short stay on the banks of the Medway is that Rochester and Chatham are thriving, prosperous towns, with a good deal more of"], [77, "CHATHAM AND ROCHESTER. 51 animation than in most provincial localities, and a picturesqueness and quaintness thrown in that are most refreshing to the tourist. What, however, is far from refreshing is the extortion practised on the unwary traveller by the money-changers, who for a 100-franc note coollv hand you \u00a33 16s., which means a rate of exchange of 5 per cent. No wonder they are prospering in Chatham. ii 2"], [78, "CHAPTER V LONDON. /CONTRARY to the general custom, religiously followed by for- eigners visiting England, who come to London first, we only saw the metropolis after staying at Dover, Canterbury, Ramsgate, and Margate. Our first impressions of this country, therefore, were obtained in the provinces. Whether we were right in the course we adopted remains to be seen ; at all events, we shall escape the reproach, generally levelled at foreigners who write about England, that we were con- A Goat-Chaise. tent to walk up and down Regent Street, see the Crystal If we did not follow the usual course and come because we were desirous of showing how very because wre were wanting in respect to, and due Palace, and then rush back to the Continent. straight to the metropolis, it is not, however, independent and original-minded we were, or tippreciation of, the mighty capital of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, but simply because we had mapped out the journey before starting, and, having once agreed on a certain itinerary, we were decided not to alter our programme for any reason. That is how it happened that we had seen a great portion of the county of Kent, when, one even ing, we made our entry into London and drove to the Charing Cross Hotel, our object being to be as nearly as possible in the centre of the metropolis. We soon found out that the centre of London is also the centre of mists and fogs, but this is neither here nor there. The Charing Cross Hotel is one of the most curious, extraordinary, and puzzling buildings we ever were in. After the usual parleying, we were placed under the charge of a servant, who took us up one flight of stairs, and then across a street spanned by an iron structure somewhat after the style of the Bridge of Sighs, into what seems to be the bachelors' wing or quarters. Our guide next went down a flight or two of stairs, closely followed by the artist and scribe, and when we were at last in our respective apartments we were surprised to find that, after having gone up one storey and gone down two more storeys, we happened to be on the fourth floor of the building. So it would seem that in this remarkable establishment, the more stairs you go down, the higher you go. We tried to understand how this startling result was arrived at, but all in vain, and to this day we have not yet been able to ascertain how, having descended so many more flights of stairs than we had ascended,"], [79, "LONDON. 53 we finally were on a level with all the roofs and chimney-pots of that part of the metropolis of which Charing Cross Station is the central point. When daylight came and we went to the window to see what sort of weather we might expect during the day, a wonderful sight met our gaze. As far as the eye could reach (not very far, probably owing to the mist and smoke) there was nothing to be seen but rows of chimney-pots of all sizes and description. Some were made of zinc or sheet iron, others of earthenware ; the latter were the more numerous, as there was generally a row of them flanked by a taller and black zinc tube, somewhat like an English officer in his black coat by the side of soldiers in red jackets. With the most perfect unanimity these chimney-pots, officers and privates, sent forth into the atmosphere clouds of smoke of varied colours. The smoke rose slowly, in straight columns, until it met a denser stratum of air through which it could not break ; it then expanded in a black sheet or pall, every moment increasing in thickness, which seemed like the roof of an immense cathedral supported by pillars of smoke. When the artist, after an exhaustive survey of the neighbouring roofs, closed his window, he found a large sheet of paper he had left on his table covered with innumerable little black specks, as closely distributed over the white surface of the paper as the holes of a sieve. This was his first acquaintance with those abominable London \" blacks,\" which pervade the atmosphere, and have a nasty habit of alighting on any piece of paper or article of linen exposed near an open window ; they also generally manage to fall on the tip of one's nose, or on one's face, where they play the part of those \" patches \" so much in vogue in the eighteenth century among ladies of fashion. Flower- Girls. From the smoking-room of the hotel we enjoyed for a long time the ever-interesting spectacle of a railway-station in full activity. As a work of art Charing Cross Station can hardly be called a thing of beauty, unless, perhaps, from the engineer's and ironmaster's exclusive point of view. Two high brick walls, divided into sunk compartments in the form of arches, and the space between spanned by a lofty glazed roof, such are the architectural or engineering features of Charing Cross Station. Under this huge half-barrel, lines of rails, separated by platforms, run towards the bridge over the Thames, and at the upper end is a large space where everybody can go in and out without let or hindrance. The booking offices and waiting-rooms being situated under the hotel, which is the usual adjunct to every English terminus, have to be traversed before the platform is reached."], [80, "SKETCHES OF ENGLAND. 54 This arrangement is altogether preferable to that which exists on the Continent, and immediately strikes foreigners as being practical, simple, and extremely convenient. The huge walls on each side are literally covered with advertising boards of every description, size, and hue, which testify to the advertising genius of the English, but hardly to their taste. The glaring colours of these advertisements are positively trying to the eye, and they must be very profitable to induce railway companies to spoil the appearance of their stations by that extraordinary display of bright colours. Advertisements in the streets, on the contrary, are very remarkable, and more than once we have been struck with the ability of the special artists who sketch the large advertising pictures in colours which are so lavishly displayed on the walls, hoardings, and houses of the metropolis. Some of the theatrical posters to be seen on the walls of the Metropolitan Railway stations and on the boards carried by sandwich-men are exceedingly well drawn and very cleverly coloured. The same can be said of the large posters, also theatrical advertisements, represent ing, some of the popular pieces run ning at the principal London play houses, or giving likenesses, and very good likenesses, too, of the chief performers. A very pretty advertisement poster was that of a soap-maker, representing a lady at her toilet table. With her short petticoat, her dainty shoes, and low-necked dressing-gown, the little lady made a very agreeable subject to look A Clerk. at, and gave one an irresistible wish to rush to the next chemist's shop and purchase a box of the soap, a piece of wdiich she held in her hand with such enticing air. Talking of soap-makers, they seem to be the most enterprising advertisers in England. There is no article which is more prominently brought under the notice of the British public, and the sum spent in advertisements must amount every year to an enormous figure. One cannot help thinking how much cheaper soap \u2014 which is not, by any means, expensive \u2014 might be if the public wrere not made to pay for these costly pictures. For there is no doubt whatever, that all this display is made at the expense of the purchaser, who has to pay not (inly for what he buys, but, besides, for the agencies through which an article, possibly inferior to another, has been brought under his attention. \" Good wine needs no bush,\" says a proverb which is as familiar to the English as to ourselves ; yet, it would seem that the British public is of a contrary opinion, and thinks that the more a thing is dinned into its ears and thrust before its eyes, the better it is. That it is so is quite evident from the scale on which houses of business advertise their goods either on the walls or in the newspaper columns specially devoted to that purpose. What is"], [81, "LONDON. 55 more surprising is that the English, who are credited with being keener business people and more practical than any other nation, do not see that all these advertising expenses have to come out of the consumer's pocket, in the same way as duties levied on articles of importa tion. No doubt it will be said that advertising is in itself an important business, in which a large number of people are employed\u2014 draughtsmen, printers, canvassers, bill-posters, and the like; but it strikes one after all that there is no reason why these people should live at the expense of the consumer, and that they might be employed to some other purpose with greater advantage to the community. The tendency of the age is to get rid of middlemen, and there is certainly no middleman who is less useful than the advertising agent. In any case few things are more striking to the newly arrived stranger in England, Hyde Park. and particularly in London, than the development which advertising has attained. The first thing you see on landing is an advertisement, you find advertisements in the railway-stations, in the railway-carriages, on the walls, on the pave ment, on the trees in the fields, on the rocks in the mountains. The only place which seems to be free of the advertising board is the deck of a Channel steamer. It is all very well for people to say that London is not England, and that a foreigner knows nothing of the English unless he has travelled all over the country, but we do not believe it. This is one of the ready-made and oft-repeated arguments which ought by this time to be done away with, as being out of date and worse than useless. There can be no doubt that London, being the capital of the United Kingdom, sums up and contains all the features of English life, manners, customs, and institutions, in the same way as Paris or Berlin gives one"], [82, "56 SKETCHES OF ENGLAND. as exact an idea of the general character of the French or German people as it is possible to obtain. The reason for this is obvious. In the first place the capital of every country has for the provincials an irresistible attraction. Students find in it libraries, schools of all kinds, technical, professional, and artistic, such as their own county does not and cannot possess; it affords to them innumerable opportunities of learning and research in all the fields of human thought and activity ; artists, again, find in the museums and public galleries food for constant study and admiration, not to mention that the most renowned masters of every art are generally residing there ; merchants and manufacturers also find in the administrative and official centre of the country information which is not available elsewhere ; literary men, as a matter of course, flock to the capital where the great publishers have their establish ments, where the leading periodicals, reviews, and newspapers are edited and published ; lawyers, also, are attracted to the fountain-head of justice ; politicians, whether militant or platonic, whether representatives of the people in esse or in posse, are naturally to be found in the place where the legislative assemblies and councils of the country meet ; the naval and military men of higher rank cannot be expected to have their headquarters very far from the ministries from which they depend, and from the service clubs where they practically live. Idlers, rich or the reverse, can spend their time more pleasantly there than in any other place, for are not all the theatres, all the shows, all the concerts, all the amusements centralised in the capital? Are not all the best actors, singers, musicians, to be seen or heard there ? Arc not all the new plays produced in the metropolis ? Men and women of the world cannot find anywhere out of London the tailors, dressmakers, milliners, jewellers, at whose establishments only they are able to provide themselves with the clothes, dresses, jewels, and nick-nacks which fashion has ordained that they shall wear or be surrounded with. And Society, polished, refined Society, where is it to be met with, except in the capital, where Drawing-rooms and Levees are held, where Court functions and balls take place, and where it has decided to reside for so many months in the year, during which parties, dinners, and receptions succeed each other from day to day, and, indeed, from night to night without interruption ? Can it be doubted, therefore, that the spot where all the intelligence, the arts, the wealth, the fashion of a country centre is of necessity also the place where one can get the best and most accurate notion of that country's manners, customs, peculiarities, and general characteristics ? London, surely, is no exception to the rule, and, when the question is considered from an unprejudiced point of view, there is much to be said in favour of the generally adopted plan\u2014 which Englishmen themselves act upon\u2014 consisting of making one's first acquaintance with a foreign country by going straight to the capital. And if travellers are content to remain there and go no farther, they should not be reproached with having seen and known nothing ; for, unless they have come with the definite object of studying the manufacturing or agricultural districts and the conditions of the workers, the impressions they have derived from a more or less prolonged stay in the capital are not likely to be altered by what they will subsequently see in the provinces. Nor will they be more accurate."], [83, "LONDON. 57 This seems to us to be true of every country where the capital is the social as well as the official metropolis, as is the case in Europe, and more so, perhaps, of England than of France, for instance. For, in spite of the decentralisation of the British governmental system \u2014 with which we have nothing to do \u2014 the English seem to be the people on earth whose manners and customs are cast in the same mould, north and south, east and west. Having made a tour in the counties, and seen several large provincial cities, such as Liverpool, Leeds, and York, this struck us very forcibly from the moment we walked through their streets, which failed to create upon us the im pression of surprise we were expecting, and had prepared for. Do not let us be misunderstood. We are not here speaking of the immense traffic of London, of the in numerable vehicles of all kinds, which, from morning to night, fill its streets with anima tion and noise; of the quantities of people to be seen walking, run ning, and hurrying, and jostling each other on the pavement. Of this we shall have something to say pre sently. What we mean to say is, that the crowd of Regent Street or of Oxford Street, for instance, is remark ably like that of Bold In a Restaurant. Street or Lord Street in Liverpool. The men wear the same tall hats and the same jackets and the women are dressed in exactly the same fashion. Were it possible for a stranger to be transported suddenly, as if by magic, from, say, Liver pool to some London street at the busy time of the day, there is nothing in the appearance of the people to show that he has been moved from one city to another. Whilst abroad, taking France as an example, there is a marked difference in the aspect of the streets and 1"], [84, "SKETCHES OF ENGLAND. 58 people of various towns. Bordeaux and the Bordelais are certainly not like Paris and the Parisians, and the people and streets of Toulouse are different from both. Lyons and its inhabitants are not like Marseilles and the Marseillais, and Rouen and the Rouennais are unlike either. The French provincial towns have retained their characteristics a great deal more, it seems to us, than the English ones, and it is a much greater mistake to assume that Paris is France than that London is England. It is not easy to explain this offhand and after a short stay only in the country, but there are a few facts which are beyond doubt, and which can reasonably be considered as having some bearing on the subject. In the first place, the communications between the metropolis and the provinces are so easy, so rapid, and so cheap that it may be assumed with tolerable certainty that English provincials go up to London much more often than French provincials go to Paris. Then, always in the same connection, England is a much smaller country than France, and that makes travelling much easier and more frequent. From London to Berwick is only 342 miles, and to Carlisle about 300; whilst from Paris to Marseilles is 525 miles, to Lyons 310, to Bordeaux 300, to Toulouse 508. Nu wonder the French inhabitant of the provinces looks twice before leaping into a train. Lastly, London, or the huge agglomeration of houses and streets known under that name, has a population of about five millions out of twenty five millions for England and Wales, so that one Englishman out of five is a Londoner. One Frenchman out of eighteen only is a Parisian. No doubt these facts must have some influence in making the people of England more uniform in appearance as a nation than any other. In appearance only, we say, for we are only talking of what we saw, and what any one can see for himself who does as we did. London, as far as the appearance and manners of the inhabitants go, its size, mightiness, and wealth appeared to us simply amazing. Of its immensity we shall say very little. For everybody has some idea of the vastness of the metropolis, if no one can tell with certainty where it ends and where it begins. This is not a joke but a simple truth; nay, more, a truism. But there is in connection with London a very startling fact, .and one to which, it strikes us, sufficient attention has not been paid by the sapient writers on England, and that is that the United Kingdom has no capital, or that, if it has one, it is not London. It may appear very presumptuous on the part of foreigners, after what is, after all, only a short visit, thus to give the lie direct to geographers, historians, economists, and other learned persons, but we repeat it, the United Kingdom has no capital, or, if it has one, it is not London. And we will now proceed to make good this bold assertion. To begin : What is a capital ? It is, say the dictionaries, that city in a country where the head of the State resides, and where the great officers of State have their offices \u2014 in a word, where the affairs of the country are managed by the responsible officials, under the supervision of the sovereign or head of the State. Vienna, Paris, Brussels, Berlin, Madrid, are capitals. But does the definition we have just given of a capital apply to London ? Not more than to Putney. London, a city on the banks of the Thames, is a rather small place, having an area of about a square mile, and a resident population of some 50,000, and represented in Parliament by two members ; but London is not the residence of the sovereign, and not one of the great offices of State is within its limits,"], [85, "LONDON. 59 with the exception of the Post Office. The houses of Parliament are not in London, nor are the ministries, nor, in fact, any official department ; all these are in Westminster, and there fore, ist he United Kingdom has a capital, it is Westminster, but not London. The royal palaces, again, are not in London, nor even for that matter in Westminster ; they are in simple parishes which do not belong even to places having the dignity of a village. St. James's Palace is astride on the parishes of St. James's and St. Martin' s-in-the-Fields, and Buckingham Palace is equally divided between the last- mentioned parish and that of St. George's. So that, to sum up the result of our inquiries, the United Kingdom has no capital or it has many. The royal capital is in St. James's, St. Martin's-in-the-Fields, and St. George's parishes, the political capital in Westminster, the commercial capital in London, the literary, artistic, and fashionable capital in Mayfair, Hampstead, and Kensington, which is equal to Billingsgate Fish Market. saying that the country has no capital to speak of \u2014 a fact which the geographers should bear in mind, aud for the discovery of which we claim no small credit. Of course a very simple way out of it would be to draw a circle from a given centre, say, Charing Cross, and to say that all the area comprised within a certain radius shall be considered as London, Westminster, or whatever other name might be decided upon as that of the capital of the United Kingdom. But there is about this suggestion a simplicity which, we fear, does not recommend it to the British mind, which seems to revel in intricacies, and to delight in allow ing things to go in a happy-go-lucky sort of way until it is found that they cannot go any further without serious consequences. This is proved beyond all manner of doubt by the simple fact that for centuries the English have allowed their country to go headless. The surprise is that they have not yet found their system as inconvenient as it appears to i2"], [86, "SKETCHES OF ENGLAND. 60 foreigners. Yet there is no doubt that they entertain some vague suspicion that there is something wrong somewhere, and they call the area occupied by their different capitals, \" the metropolis,\" which is a convenient if somewhat obscure way of getting over the difficulty, for there is no means of ascertaining where their metropolis begins, or where it ends. For, mt referring to our friends, the guide-books, we find that there are nine different boundaries given ofthe metropolitan area. The most striking feature of London (we use the name for want of a better) is the late ness of the hour at which the day's business commences, and the traffic in the streets begins in earnest. If you walk along the chief thoroughfares of the West End, Oxford Street, Regent Street, Piccadilly and Bond Street, in the morning, you are astonished to find that they are sweeping, dusting, cleaning the shops at a time when, on the Continent, these various operations have been performed long ago, and business is in full swing. As to \"dressing\" the shop windows, this again is done very late \u2014 when it is done- and done, it must be said, very badly in all cases. We say when it is done, because we have passed day after day before shops whose display never varied, and we say badly done because of the want of taste, which is about the only thing displayed in the shop windows. The idea an English shopkeeper or shopkeeper's assistant, male or female, has of dressing a window, is to throw in the largest possible quantity of things in the smallest given space. There is a saying of the trees preventing one from seeing the forest. That is exactly the effect produced on the passer-by by an English shop, in which it is a sheer impossibility to find anything or to look at anything. Instead of disposing their goods in such a manner as to lead the eye up to the finest objects exhibited, or to those which it is desired to get the public to notice and to purchase, they heap them up in a confusion which has nothing artistic about it. The jewellers are among the worst offenders in this respect. Their windows are like those of the Paris sham jewellers' shops in some of the passages. There you see a mass of watch-chains, next to which are scores of bracelets, or brooches, or lockets. Fine jewels, rings, earrings, necklaces, enriched with precious stones, are thrown in irrespective of the colours of the stones, the shimmer of the diamonds, or the brilliancy of the pearls. If there is a fine gem or a remarkable jewel, you may be certain that every means has been resorted to to hide it behind some worth less piece of jewellery, or to \"kill\" it by juxtaposition with some other indifferent but showy specimen. The contrast between the Bond Street shops and those of the Rue de la Paix, for instance, is positively painful to the eye, though gratifying to national feeling. Drapers' shops, haberdashers', stationers', and fancy dealers' are equally poor, not in the quality or quantity of their wares, but in the display of them. There is, however, one excep tion, which is the more noticeable as it is to be found where you least expect it, and that is the best fishmongers', where the tasteful display of finny creatures and crustaceans is truly remarkable. On the black marble slabs, the pearly scales glimmer among a mass of broken ice, and the greenery plentifully displayed shows off the pink flesh of the salmon and the deep red shells of the lobsters, crabs, and other denizens of the deep. It may appear strange that of all shops the fishmongers' should be the prettiest to look at, but any one not prejudiced and having an eye for colour will bear out our statement. On the contrary, flower shops,"], [87, "LONDON. 61 which are one of the features of Paris, make a very poor show in London, even the most renowned establishments in the West End being of a very inferior order. The few flowers stuck in glass or earthenware vases and the bouquets in the windows give a very poor idea of English florists, which is the more surprising as English horticulturists are among the most skilful, as evidenced by the parks and public gardens of London, where the flowers are, as a rule, magnificent. As a natural consequence, walking in the streets of London is not, as on the Continent, a feast for the eye, which is soon tired by the too lavish exhibition of every possible kind of articles. The narrowness ofthe footway, except in Regent Street, is also a drawback, to which must be added a singular arrangement of the shop fronts which is absolutely dangerous. In a great number of cases there ex tend in front of the houses, stone slabs, raised above the asphalte, against which, as there is nothing to warn the un wary stranger, one stumbles, and sometimes falls. It is hard to understand how, in a city like London, the authorities, parochial, municipal, or others, allow this sort of thing, which in any other capital would be promptly seen to and prevented. But this is not the only trap set by the ingenious architects and road surveyors. The coal-plates are a constant source of danger, and so are the stones placed against the lamp-posts and projecting out into the roadway, so that a carriage whose wheels run close to the kerbstone must be upset if it comes into contact with them. Another thing which makes it almost impossible to walk leisurely along the streets is that the people have a rough way of jostling and of treading on the heels of those in front of them, or of poking their sticks and umbrellas in the ribs or legs of those who are simply sightseers, and do not rush. As to parasols, they are a formidable weapon in the hands of English ladies, who run full tilt against any obstacle, whether a man's hat or his eyes, with out moving their sunshades, which they hold as a chorister-boy holds a candle at a Roman Catholic procession, and about as gracefully. After a short time, however, one gets accustomed to this kind of thing, and by keeping a sharp look-out it is possible to steer clear of raised slabs, projecting stones, coal-plates, sticks, umbrellas, and parasols, and to return home to the hotel without greater injury than a hat crushed"], [88, "SKETCHES OF ENGLAND. 62 under some shop awning, or a garment whitened by contact with a stonemason's coat. A very remarkable thing about London \u2014 one may say, an English street in general \u2014 is the very neat and tasteful style of dress adopted by the men, which is in striking contrast with the eccentric dress of the women. That there are admirably dressed women in the streets of London goes without saying, but they are few and far between. For a woman to be well dressed, something more is required than a hat or bonnet in the newest style, a dress, or a jacket, or cloak in the latest fashion, or a flaming sash or parasol. The head-gear must be becoming to her own particular style of face, her dress to her figure, her height, her age, and finally, all the component parts of her costume must be in harmony with each other. Well, this is seldom seen in England, where the same hats are worn by young girls of sixteen and old ladies of sixty, and where women of mature years and buxom appearance think it quite natural to wear dresses similar to those of their unmarried daughters. This is especially noticeable in well-to-do people, presumably in what would be called by English people women of the middle and upper middle classes, who make it a point to follow the fashions. That is, by the way, exactly what they do \u2014 they follow them, but they do not always successfully come up to them. But to English women much will be forgiven, and is forgiven, because they are \u2014 a great many of them \u2014 so lovely. For the number of pretty faces one meets in London is as extra ordinary as it is pleasant, and more than makes up for the want of interesting display in the shop windows. It has occurred to us that, possibly, the London tradespeople, out of compliment to their fair compatriots, purposely dress their shop windows in such an inferior manner, so that nothing should divert the passer-by's admiring attention from the ladies, and we mentioned the idea to a friend who has long resided in London, at the same time extolling the very gallant and almost poetical turn of mind ofthe shopkeepers. But our friend laughed in our faces, and we were fain, after hearing his explanation, to acquit the London tradespeople of any gallant intention, and to convict them of want of taste. We regret it. To return to our subject \u2014 the more one sees English women, the prettier he finds them. There is, however, with regard to this, a question which we often asked ourselves, and to which we could find no satisfactory explanation. There are certainly more beautiful women and girls in England, and particularly in London, than anywhere else. To be convinced of this, it is only necessary to take a walk along Piccadilly, Bond Street, Oxford Street, Hyde Park, and almost in any part of the metropolis, or to visit an exhibition, a picture-gallery, or any public place. Well, this being granted, how is it that the English women one meets abroad in railway-trains, in the streets, in the hotels, in the mountains of Switzerland, in the watering-places of France, Germany, or Belgium are so painfully u nlike their sisters in England ? Are the pretty girls forbidden from leaving England, or when they travel on the Continent do they \" make up \" to look plain, or is it that the surroundings do not suit their type of beauty, or do they lose by comparison with foreign women, and is it true that, as a French writer of the olden times has it, grace is more beautiful than beauty ? Be that as it may, the fact remains that the English"], [89, "LONDON. 63 women of French caricaturists do not appear so exaggerated when one sees the models they have under their eyes ; although nothing could possibly be more unlike them than the English women of England. Of course all these things are small matters, but they strike strangers very forcibly, and cannot be omitted in the record of impressions made on the mind by a first view of London A matter of more importance, because it gives an insight into the customs and disposition of the poorer classes, deserves to be here noted. We allude to the raggedness, dirt, squalor, and repulsive appearance of the working people of both sexes one meets in the streets of London, and in the poorer quarters. We do not allude simply to their faded gar ments, worn-out shoes, or battered hats and bonnets, but to their filthy state. Working men and women, and men and women who can not claim to be so designated, there are in every country who are as poor as m England, but no where is there to be seen such an utter untidiness in men and women alike. The use of needle and thread seems to be un- London Bridge. known to most of the women of England. They go about the streets with torn dresses or coats without buttons, which they never mend, and wear until they literally fall off their backs. Even when their clothes are clean and of comparatively good quality, the same thing obtains. Times out of number we have seen women and girls of the humbler classes, parading the streets on a fine, bright, sunny day, with the mud they never seem to brush off. They wear ten fingers peeps through them ; they wear on their dresses of the preceding day, which gloves, it is true, but every one of their buttoned boots, but the buttons have come off and never been replaced ; their skirts are of"], [90, "SKETCHES OF ENGLAND. 64 silk, but there are rents in them which are not mended ; their dresses show the under garment through the seam, the stitches of which have given way ; but they go out in them all the same. And the husbands of these women are equally badly off : trousers, coats, waistcoats are bereft of buttons ; if they are mended they are clumsily vamped up : a blue coat with a piece of grey cloth, and vice versa. Then these men go to the public-house and get drunk ; they return home and beat their wives. If an inquiry were made into the circumstances attending and preceding each case of brutality brought before the police-magistrates of London, daily reported in the papers, it is possible that it would be found, in more instances than one, that the brutality of the men has been brought about by the utter inability of their wives to keep their little homes decent, cheerful, and comfortable. We hear a good deal of the drunkenness of the English, of the brutal manners of the working men, who beat their better halves when in their cups. We have a strong suspicion that the British working man may possibly not be so black as he is painted, and that his wife has much to answer for, and is not the angel of sweetness she is represented by the social reformers, male or female. We have, in our walks on the south side of the Thames, and in other districts on the north side, in Westminster and Pimlico, for instance, passed through a number of by-streets, with small houses having one storey only above the ground floor, and inhabited almost exclusively by working men and their families, and in every case these facts were most conspicuous, and uniformly attracted our attention. It is not the poverty of these people that struck us, but their astounding untidiness, and apparently utter ignorance of how to keep their clothes decent and mended. What the home of such people may be is a matter of conjecture to us, for we cannot say we ever went into one of them, and if we had, it is more than probable that we should be no wiser than before, for a cursory glance at the furniture and fittings would afford but little information as to their mode of living. But from external appearances we concluded that there is very little real comfort in the English working man's home in the way of garments and food. We had an opportunity on a subsequent occasion of mentioning this impression of ours to a foreign resident who acted at various times as our friend, philosopher, and guide in our rambles through the metropolis. His long sojourn in England, and the exceptional facilities his profession affords him of knowing how the working classes live, enable him to speak with some authority on the subject. He corroborated to a great extent our impressions. \" A great number of the women,\" he said to us, \"have been servants in their younger days, and when they are in service they are compelled to look neat and tidy, as every one can see who goes into an English house; but the neat and tidy girl who opens the door and waits at table in snowy white apron and cap looks a very different person when she goes out for her holiday, or for a simple walk, in tawdry and ridiculous finery. Her object is to get married as soon as she can, for then she expects her husband to work for her and keep her. She generally 'keeps company ' with a young man she has met in her walks, or as often as not, some man who is employed in a neighbouring shop, the greengrocer's or butcher's man, or a postman, attracted by her good looks. I have had,\" he went on, \"a number of these girls in my house, and not one of them could do anything besides cleaning plate, opening the door, and wait at table ;"], [91, "LONDON. 65 not a stitch were they able to do, not even for themselves, and as to cook a dinner in the absence of the cook, they could as soon have danced on the tight-rope : nay, they even prided themselves on their inability to understand cooking. Four of these girls left my service to get married, and in every single case my feelings, on hearing of their marriage, was one of deep sympathy and pity for the poor man who was thus going to be made miserable for life.\" This confirmed our opinion that the abject misery and poverty to be seen in England are not due solely to drunkenness, which in many cases is the result and not the cause of a number of evils. Talking of drunkenness reminds us of the countless public-houses to be seen in London, and their apparent prosperity. Curiosity made us enter two or three public-houses, and we came out of them with greater alacrity than we went in. The atmosphere, the smells, and the company soon drove us out, with the impres sion that to re main in them long enough to get drunk requires on the part of the consumers a true vocation for in ebriety. For nothing can be more uncomfort able than these bars or counters, before which people have to stand like so many animals before a trough. Truly if At a Picture Gallery English working men get drunk, it is certainly not because the public-houses and taverns are made attractive. There is very little, it must be admitted, that is attractive in the streets of London. Of the shops and the people we have recorded our impression, the latter being a good deal more interesting than the former. There is a great lack of beauty in the houses of the most fashionable quarters ; Piccadilly, Belgrave Square, Grosvenor Square, are lined with buildings ofthe most ordinary and uninviting appearance. But if one goes farther west, the aspect changes considerably for the better, and the red brick houses of Chelsea and Kensington, with gables and quaint architectural devices, give those parts of London a picturesque and very pleasant aspect. The only objection is that to see them, you have to go a very long way, and in K"], [92, "SKETCHES OF ENGLAND. 66 districts which, unless you have some call to make or some business to transact there, offer no attraction, as they lead nowhere in particular. A few rambles in these parts of the town, and in out-of-the-way corners, have afforded us a curious example of unpractical arrangements which, in practical England, are well-nigh incredible. Many houses in the western districts were to be let, and enormous black boards with white letters, supplemented with white posters with black ones, notified the fact to the passers-by and possible tenants. But they all remained unlet, and had been for a considerable time. As they appeared very comfortable houses this was astonishing. Closer inspection of the boards explained this to some extent. We were in Shepherd's Bush, and the boards said that to view \" these desirable premises,\" intending tenants were to apply to Messrs. X. Y. Z., somewhere in the City, a distance of fully four if not five miles. No wonder the houses were unlet. Talking of practical arrangements reminds us that . the English, practical as they are supposed to be, are hardly more so than other nations, and that many things to be seen in Germany, Belgium, or Italy strike travellers just as much as those one sees in England. Among things unpractical which are at once noticed by strangers we may mention the sash windows commonly used in English houses, and which cannot be cleaned without trouble and danger, to such point that a law has been passed, it appears, which makes it an offence for any person to order a servant to clean them from the outside, the only possible way, be it said in passing, to clean them. It should be added that the law is observed in the breach more than in the observance. Then again the impossibility of obtaining a postage-stamp after eight o'clock at night in shops where there is a post-office, even when they are open after that hour, is a most absurd arrangement, to which the unsatisfactory reply and explanation is that post office business closes at eight. Another very unpractical arrangement is that owing to which the streets of London arc allowed to remain unswept and unwatered from Saturday till Monday, and even till Tuesday, if, as it happened in August, the Monday is what is termed a bank holiday. In connec tion with street cleaning and watering, the English mode of proceeding is a very curious one. As in every other place, they water the streets to lay the dust, but do not sweep the road afterwards ; the result is that in summer, even when it does not rain, the streets of London are like a sea of mud ; on a bright day, when it has not rained for twenty-four hours, it is a common thing to see people with muddy boots. And, may we ask, is it very practical to dub a water-cart \u2014 hydrostatic van ? By the way, there are a great number of Greco-Latin words which, for some reason or other, the English are very fond of, such as pantechnicon, emporium, and so on, which one meets at almost every street corner. Of the vehicles of the streets of London, the most remarkable is the hansom cab. More intimate acquaintance with this kind of carriage has not altered our first impressions. In fine weather it is charming, but on cold or rainy days it is most inconvenient. It is also dangerous ; if the horse falls you run the risk of being thrown forward and bruised against the splashboard, and, if the window is down, of being cruelly cut by the broken glass. This, no doubt, is the reason why English people very seldom have the glass down, and prefer"], [93, "LONDON. 67 using their umbrella as a protection against rain, an example which every one should follow. / But what wonderful drivers are the cabmen, carmen, omnibus drivers, coachmen, and every. body who, in London, is intrusted with one or several horses ! It is a pleasure to watch them threading their way through crowds of vehicles, especially at cross-roads such as Piccadilly Circus, Oxford Circus, and Hyde Park Corner ; and as to the spot in front of the Royal Exchange, the pleasure is changed into a kind of awful admiration. How they manage to get there, and, having got there, to get out of it again, is simply incredible, and cannot be described. Equally admirable is the manner in which the policemen manage the street traffic, particularly in the City, where the thoroughfares are narrow, and the number of carriages of all kinds enormous. The whole thing is perfectly wonderful. On a given point seven or eight roads converge, each disgorging a stream of cabs, omnibuses, carts, vans, drays ; it seems as if hopeless confusion were, to follow. But no : the man in blue is there ; he signals to the drivers that they are to stop or to move, and without noise, without any words, without the shadow of anything like fuss or useless interference on the part of the police, or of ill temper or unruliness on that of the drivers, out of chaos order springs. The vehicles find a means of extricating themselves from a maze which would puzzle any one except London drivers ; the foot passengers, meanwhile, are made to file past iu small groups, whilst the more impatient telegraph and errand boys disappear among the carriages, ducking under the horses' necks, to reappear a few moments later on the other side of the street. There is not in London, perhaps, a more curious and characteristic sight than that which is to be witnessed every morning in front of the Mansion House \u2014 not even London Bridge with its enormous traffic, nor the Billingsgate Fishmarket and Thames Street, where vehicles of all kinds seem to remain for hours stationary, without being able to move one step backwards or forwards. It may be that \"time is money \" ; if so, what enormous sums are daily thrown into the gutters of the streets of the City, owing to the time wasted in these narrow lanes and alleys. Much as it would cost to pull down some of the houses in order to widen these thoroughfares, it would in the long run perhaps be a saving to demolish part of the City and to rebuild it on a more practical plan. Talking of the traffic of London, immense as it is, it may well be questioned whether it is quite equal to that of Paris. There is no doubt that certain streets of the metropolis are at some hours of the day almost impassable ; but it is only in the main arteries that such is the case. The vehicular and passenger traffic of London is, to a very remarkable and striking extent dammed up into a comparatively small number of recognised channels, whilst parallel to these are a number of less important streets, through which no one ever passes on foot, and no cabman drives his horse. The result of this is that if, on given points, the street traffic of the metropolis is as large and larger than anywhere, it is far from being so general and so equally distributed over the area of the town, even in the central parts of it. If we may be allowed to compare the traffic of Patis with that of London, our meaning, to those who have seen both cities, will at once be clear. Go where you will in Paris, there is, practically, the same amount of traffic all over the town ; there is, one may say, no street where people and vehicles k2"], [94, "SKETCHES OF ENGLAND. 68 do not pass. It would be easy to name a number of streets in London where no one ever passes but the people who live there, and those who visit them. The main arteries we speak of are, as a rule, those which have been adopted by the lines of omnibuses. The omnibus, by the way, is far the best, cheapest, most convenient, entertaining, and instructive mode of locomotion in London. And there is no place where a tourist can more profitably employ his time than in or on an omnibus. If he wishes to get an idea of the peculiarities of the people, let him get inside one of these vehicles, and as it goes, say, from Brompton to the City, he will see defile before him all sorts and conditions of people, as different in costume, manners, and speech as if he were travelling through two or three distinct towns. Let him travel in the morning, in the afternoon, or in the evening, and then again the classes of passengers will vastly vary, according to the time of day and to the easterly and westerly direction in which they go. For the omnibus is, in London at least, the truly popular vehicle \u2014 popular, that is, in the sense that it is in favour with all the classes of the community. The time has gone by when well-to-do people were ashamed of getting into an omnibus, and, singularly enough, the better classes who did not ride in them when the fares were high, patronise them largely now that the penny fare enables every one, even the poorest working man or woman, to ride to his or her destination. But we must here mention a curious fact which strongly bears out what we have already said with regard to the social lines of demarcation between the classes in England. Even in omnibuses there is a distinction. The passengers of the London General Omnibus Company are, generally speaking, people of a different class to the regular customers of the London Road Car Company or of the private omnibuses ; this fact was pointed out to us, and we have had frequent opportunities of noticing it ourselves. As we have said before, the omnibus is the popular vehicle par excellence : here you meet clubmen, tradesmen, and clerks, working men and loafers. Many a member of the military and naval clubs in Piccadilly gets into the 'bus at Kensington or Knightsbridge, and rides as far as Piccadilly Circus or Waterloo Place. It is the same with ladies, and we have often met, between Kensington and Piccadilly , a lady whose sister is the wife of a noble lord, now Her Majesty's ambassador in a great foreign capital. Thorough-going middle-class ladies are in this respect more punctilious and particular than their more and less aristocratic sisters but they alone are an exception. Officers' wives, professional men's wives, and the less Philistine middle-class women ride in omnibuses ; so do actresses (we often met in our rides on a particular line one of the most graceful and successful singers of comic opera in London) artists, lady journalists, tradeswomen, work-girls, and shop-girls,, servants, and, in short, everybody. The London omnibus is a lighter vehicle than the French one, and not quite so com fortable inside ; outside, however, the garden seats, placed crossways, are most convenient, and are easily reached by a staircase. As every kind of carriage in London, it is well horsed and splendidly driven, and the conductors are among the most civil, obliging, and honest public servants to be found in any country. What a difference between the London 'bus conductor and the rough, surly, uncivil Paris 'bus conductor. The former has no uniform, it is true,"], [95, "LONDON. 69 but he is generally smart if a young man, and very tidy if an old one ; he stops his 'bus at the first signal of the passenger, assists ladies and children in and out, and is most accommodating in every respect. We once saw a lady, who had no change, offer two penny stamps as payment to the conductor, who took them instead of the bronze coin he was entitled to demand. When we see the same thing in Paris the millennium will be at hand. English people take all this as a matter of course ; they must be congratulated on having so well trained their public servants, policemen, railway-men, 'bus-men, and others. If only the French could be induced to do the same what an improvement it would be, and how much more enjoyable life would be in Paris ; but so far the French public is satisfied with being the slave of its servants, who rule over their masters, and rule with an iron hand, too. The morning omnibus, on its way to the City, is full of regular customers, men, for the greater part, with a fair sprinkling of young women, shop-girls, and work-girls going to their places of business. It affords a good opportunity to study the manners of a numerous class of people, that of the City men and tradesmen of the West End who live in the suburbs, and their clerks and employes, men and women. The men, old and young, are for the greater part very neatly and even stylishly dressed \u2014 this has already been noticed ; and, among Englishwomen of the middle class, none dress so quietly and tastefully as the shop women and girls who are in business \u2014 on week-days, that is, for they are compelled by their employers to avoid showy costumes. On Sundays the same young women and girls are free to dress as they An Alma Tadema. like, and what a sorry exhibition they make of themselves, any one walking in Hyde Park on a Sunday afternoon can judge for himself. Thus the good taste we admired on week-days happens to be not natural, but compulsory. We regretfully note the fact. The afternoon passengers are of a different stamp and mostly belong to the leisured classes. They are, for the greater part, ladies coming from the western districts to the more central West End quarter properly so called, and which for them is confined within Bond Street and Regent Street, and Piccadilly and Oxford Street, the headquarters of elegant shops. A few clubmen are also to be found in these omnibuses, and they carefully stop the vehicle within a few doors of their clubs. They are not ashamed of saying that they ride in an omnibus, but somehow or other, they do not care about being seen getting out of one. On Sundays the omnibuses are generally full of holiday-makers, among whom the engaged couples are most numerous. A curious English institution the engaged couple ! When two"], [96, "SKETCHES OF ENGLAND. 70 young people have a fancy for one another, they get engaged, which means chiefly that they are allowed to walk out together, en tout bien tout honneur, and ultimately intend, if all goes well, at some future and indefinite time to be united in matrimony. The engaged couples as a rule belong to the following classes, female servants and shop-men, and shop-girls and clerks, together with a large number of tradesmen's sons and daughters. They are to be seen in the omnibuses going to Kew and Hampton Court, seated close to one another, and as silent and contemplative as at the seaside. If outside, the swain smokes a short briar pipe or a cigar and says not a word ; if inside he plays with his stick and keeps silent. In both cases the young lady, bedecked with ribbons, feathers, flowers, and covered with silver jewellery, is dumb. A most amusing thing is to see the couples getting into an omnibus. The young fellow hails the driver or conductor, rushes in, sits down, grins, and calmly awaits his female com panion, who is helped in by the conductor. Before dismissing the subject of omnibuses, there is one thing to be noted, and a warning to be given to foreigners travelling in them. For some mysterious reason an Englishman never holds his stick or umbrella by the handle, but by the opposite end, and, as soon as he has taken his seat in a public carriage, proceeds to turn his national weapon so as to restore it to its normal position. This he does very clumsily, and with great risk to his neighbours' eyes and nose. Young men especially are to be watched very closely when they get in, as they are the most reckless and clumsy of beings when handling a stick or umbrella. If they don't poke it in your ace, they generally manage to drop it on your toes. A young Englishman generally experiences great difficulty in managing and controlling his lower limbs when not using them for pur poses of locomotion, and should be given a wide berth both in omnibuses and railway-carriages. This reminds us that among the modes of locomotion used by Londoners, the Metropolitan Railway is a very convenient one, as far as speed is concerned, though a most uncomfortable one from every other point of view. On a sultry August day there is no more cruel torture than a trip on the Underground Railway. The heat in the closed, stuffy carriages is intoler able, and the absence of ventilation, combined with the noxious vapours given off by the engine, is a serious danger to people whose lungs have not been specially adapted to the peculiar atmosphere of this subterranean railway. Besides, the fares are rather high, and the omnibus is much to be preferred to the Metropolitan. If the people who want to inflict on the Parisians the Underground Railway torture were to be compelled to travel in the London Metropolitan, say, for two hours, the chances are that they would never persist in their rash scheme, for it is very likely that some of them would not come out of it alive, which would act as a deterrent on their colleagues, and save Paris from a serious danger to the population. We shall not forget in a hurry the sensation of immense relief we once experienced on getting out of the train at Queen's Road Station after coming from the City, and the delight with which we sat down in Kensington Gardens under a tree whose branches protected us against the rays of the sun, whilst a cool breeze played around us. Neither of us has ever been in Africa, but we can now realise the anguish of a traveller in the desert, and his feelings when meeting with an oasis."], [97, "LONDON. 71 In more senses than one, the parks of the metropolis are to be considered as the oases of the great desert of asphalte and wood pavement called London \u2014 oases in which the weary traveller is delighted to find a seat where he can enjoy a few minutes' rest. For it is one of the most trying and fatiguing tasks, that of sight-seeing in London ! Go where you will, you will not find, except in the immediate and near neighbourhood of Charing Cross \u2014 where they are not wanted, because it is the great centre and starting-point of tourists and travellers whether foreigners or British provincials \u2014 a seat in a public street or square, or a cafe or decent At the Alhambra. restaurant where you can get a meal, or only a cup of coffee or a glass of lemonade if you are thirsty. There is nothing to be done except to go on until, from sheer exhaustion, you give it up and hail a cab to return to your quarters at the hotel. As a matter of course, there are public-houses, and more than enough ; but a foreigner who once puts his foot into one of these establishments never wishes to enter another, and as to the coffee and confectioners' shops, which are also plentiful, the extract of beans and peas served under the name of coffee and the stale and indigestible masonry-like pastry to be had in them are only to be consumed"], [98, "SKETCHES OF ENGLAND. 72 by natives, or by those who, by long and patient training, have succeeded in getting their digestive organs accustomed to such fare. The numerous and large squares of London, with their verdure, flowers, and fine trees, might also be transformed into delightful places of recreation or of rest, but they are not, and the greater the pity. Theoretically speaking, only those persons whose houses are in the square are suffered and allowed to use them, but in practice it will be found that they do not avail themselves of this privilege \u2014 for which they pay, it is quite true. They are content with looking at the trees from their windows, so that practically the squares of London are useless, except as open spaces over which no one is allowed to build. By a dog-in-the manger feeling very common in England, the people who do not use the squares to which they alone have access will not allow others to use them. They object to the common people treading on their grass or walking on their gravel-paths ; ' ' they are so rough, you know,\" they say. Truly the English love one another very much\u2014 at a distance. If, however, the upper classes do not allow their poorer brethren to use their squares for which they pay, let us repeat it, they, on the other hand, claim the exclusive right to drive in Hyde Park, for the maintenance of which the poorer brethren pay just as much as their more for tunate countrymen. For of all the parks in London, Hyde Park is the finest, the most pleasant, the best situated, and that which Society patronises almost exclusively. Here they ride in the morning and drive in the afternoon, and lounge and sit on Sundays in that brief interval between the morning church service and lunch-time. Oh, that afternoon drive in Hyde Park ! what an amusing spectacle it is ! Let us say at once that the carriages are fine, the horses, generally speaking, excellent, the coachmen clever, and the footmen highly ornamental, but the people are simply laughable. The unfailing punctuality, the seriousness, the gravity with which one half of London Society drives in Hyde Park every week-day in the season between the hours of five and seven, to be looked at, whilst the other half walk, or sit and look at them \u2014 all this constitutes one of the most absurdly entertaining of all social conventions ever invented by man \u2014 entertaining, that is to say, for the onlookers, for those who take part in the function do not appear to find it a very exhilarating affair. If, contrary to all appearances, they do, then it can be safely asserted that, as far as London Society is con cerned, physiognomy has been given to men (and women) to conceal their thoughts. Time after time they go up and down the unique road in which it is considered \" good form \" to be seen, mostly at a snail's pace, because of the enormous number of vehicles concentrated on this single spot. For several days together we made it a point of going to see the two halves of London Society in Hyde Park, the lookers on and the looked at, and every day the same carriages, contain ing the same people, arrayed in the same dresses, sporting the same flaming parasols, filed past to our intense delight, A certain red parasol, over a certain yellow dress, with an intermediate green hat with a remarkable display of multicoloured feathers, very much like a funeral horse's plumes, we hailed and recognised as an old friend, as we saw it, day after day, pass in state, held with much dignity by its owner\u2014 no doubt a lady of high degree. But even to look at London Society in its gorgeousness, and displaying its finery, luxury,"], [99, "LONDON. 73 and wealth, becomes a tiresome affair, and a little music under the shade of the trees would be a welcome relief. A band-stand, not very far off, raises in the unwary foreigner pleasant expectations, which, however, are not realised, for the band only plays on Sundays, and even then there is some uncertainty about it, as the concerts are given under the auspices of a private association. The idea that immediately occurs is that in a city like London, with so many regimental bands available, some arrangement might be come to whereby concerts could be given several times a week, not only in Hyde Park, but in the other parks of the metropolis. Nothing could be more simple, and it is done in all countries ; but the very simplicity and generality of the custom abroad, is probably the only reason which militates against it being adopted in England. There is another reason, perhaps, which is that during the season regimental bands are engaged to play at private parties, concerts and balls. What a delightful country England is \u2014 for a few privileged persons ! Clever horticulturists as the English are, there is in the arrangement of the flowers in their parks a lack of taste which is very striking. Some of the flower-beds composed of masses of rhododendrons and other flowers are extremely beautiful and effective, but the custom of disposing flowers so as to form wheels, lyres, monograms, and Prince of Wales's feathers, is not one that commends itself much to the taste of most people. Some of these flower-beds are very much like a plate of lobster salad with artichokes, radishes, and hard boiled eggs arranged in concentric circles. Flowers have never been intended to be grown in that way, and the arrangement in masses so as to produce effects of colour is certainly the most natural, as it is the prettiest. After the parks, the most interesting walk in London is the Embankment along the Thames, where the palaces, churches, and fine buildings on the north side stand in striking contrast to the wharves, factories, breweries, and tall chimneys to be seen on the south bank. From Waterloo Bridge, the view, on a fine day, is remarkably beautiful. On the right rises the lofty dome of St. Paul's, towering high above the hundreds of steeples rising on all sides from among the grey houses of the City ; opposite the bridge, the facade of Somerset House, one of the finest edifices in London, stretches along the Embankment ; to the left is the imposing mass of the Houses of Parliament, with its numberless pinnacles and its huge towers, whose gilded tops glisten in the sun ; underneath flows the river, covered with pleasure craft, steam tugs, and passenger boats, barges and lighters \u2014 anything but a silent highway ; behind is industrial London, a gigantic hive where they manufacture almost every conceivable object \u2014 all this makes the scene around one of great beauty and impressiveness. Then an idea can be formed of the unique character of London and of the greatness of the British nation ; then London appears at once as a city of luxury, a commercial and industrial centre, a large port in communication with every part of the world, and the metropolis of a mighty empire. From no other spot in London can so imposing and suggestive a scene be contemplated, and one more likely to convey an exact impression of England's grandeur and power, and of its rank among the nations of the earth. \u00b1j"], [100, "CHAPTER VI. OXFORD. HERE are few English towns whose name is more familiar to foreigners than Oxford. There are, it should immediately be added, few places less known to @&Ab&\\ them, and out of a hundred travellers or tourists coming from the Continent, we make bold to say that not five go to Oxford. People visit Liverpool or Scotland, a good many run down to Brighton, but Oxford appears to be beyond the range of practical touring. Why it is so it would be difficult to say, for Oxford, being within less than two hours of the metropolis, and easily accessible by means of the Great Western and London and North Western Railways, ought to be one of the most frequented places in England. Possibly the university authorities, for reasons which may be understood if things be considered from the point of view of insular-mindedness, do not encourage the presence of visitors to the most famous seat of learning in Great Britain. It is a remarkable fact that whereas railway companies extensively advertise and give facilities for visiting a number of places both inland and at the seaside, by means of huge and showy placards, which meet the eye at every corner of the metropolis, and of conspicuous announcements in the columns of the daily papers, we never saw an advertisement inviting the public to visit Oxford. Yet it must be admitted that there is a good deal more to be seen and to be learned at Oxford than at Well, comparisons are odious, and we will not mention names. Let the reader fill them in himself according to his fancy and the recollection of bad hotel accommodation, worse dinners, and long bills. Whatever the causes may be, the fact remains that to most foreigners Oxford is a sort of terra incognita, and it is to be regretted, as the old university town is a very characteristic and picturesque place, not only on account of its situation, of its monuments, and of its general aspect, but also on account of its institutions and of its peculiar life. We have just called Oxford an old university town, but if the enthusiastic authors who have made it the subject of their works are to be believed, the adjective old is strangely inadequate to express the antiquity of Oxford. For these gentlemen will have it that the foundation of Oxford dates a few centuries farther back than that of Rome. Very likely people could be found to assert, with the help of musty old parchments and manuscripts of undoubted authenticity, of course, that the first portion of the globe inhabited after the creation of the world was Oxford, and that the garden of Eden was situated somewhere in the vicinity of the University Park. One antiquary has been good and modest enough to fix the foundation of Oxford at some one thousand and nine years before Christ ; whilst the"], [101, "OXFORD. 75 worthy man was about it, he might have gone back a few centuries more, as no one would have been able to contradict him. The truth seems to be that no one exactly knows when Oxford was founded, and it really matters very little to the tourist or, for the matter of that, to any one living. Nor is anybody able to say whence its name is derived, some being of opinion that its old name of Oxenford was given to the place because there was at that particular spot a ford much traversed by oxen ; whilst others assert that it is merely a corruption of Ousenford, the ford over the Ouse, Ouse being supposed to be the ancient name of the Isis, which is the academical and university name of the Thames. Isis is pretty, and has an antique and learned sound full of charms, especially when it is not pronounced by an Englishman, for nothing can be more barbarous than the English pronunciation of the I in Latin words. We have before our eyes the arms of the city of Oxford, in which an animal with horns, supposed to be an ox, is seen walking over some horizontal lines, the meaning of Coaching which is that in a coloured drawing this portion of the shield would be of azure. This evidently represents an ox crossing a ford. Is not that sufficient to prove to any sane man that Oxenford, and subsequently Oxford, are clearly derived from the ox and the ford? Some people, of course, will insist that the arms of the city were not assumed by Oxford till long after the town had a name ; but if such quibblers were to be believed or listened to, and their ideas to prevail, what would become of professional etymologists ? Why, their occupation would be gone, and what a misfortune that would be ! Just fancy what a loser the world would be through the disappearance of the ingenious gentlemen who found that \u2014 to mention instances connected with Oxford only \u2014 Carfax, the intersection of the four principal streets in the town, is a corruption of qvatre votes _ or that Eglesfield is derived from aiguille an&fl? These far-fetched etymological jokes remind one ofthe four lines written in the last century upon the lexicographers and etymologists of the period, who tried their best to l2"], [102, "SKETCHES OF ENGLAND. -1\u00b0 make people believe that the French Avord cheval came from the Latin word equus. A wit then wrote : \u2014 \"Cheval vient (Tequus sans doute ; Mais il faut avouer aussi, Qu'en venant de la jusqu'ici, II a bien change sur la route.\" So have Carfax and Eglesfield considerably altered on the way from quatre voies and aiguille and fil ; and it would be difficult to find a better illustration of that kind of etymology which Voltaire described as \" a science in which vowels count for nothing, and consonants for very little.\" In any case it is pretty certain that, like Leeds \u2014 and that is the only point of resemblance between the two places \u2014 Oxford was not built by the Romans, for no Roman remains have ever been found in the town or its neighbourhood. If great uncertainty prevails as to the foundation ofthe city, not much more is known as to the origin of the university. It was gratifying to us to be told that, notwithstanding its antiquity, dignity, and reputation, the University of Oxford is in every single respect second to the venerable \" Universite de Paris\"; but after indulging in a little excusable Chauvinism and national pride, we could not help thinking that, like so many other institutions, the University of Paris is a thing of the past, whilst the University of Oxford is flourishing, and likely to last for a long time to come. King Alfred the Great is generally credited with being the founder of the University, although Professor Freeman has\" ruthlessly swept away that legend after the manner of the historians of modern times, who will insist on being so absolutely accurate. He says that Oxford had no history previous to the tenth century, that in the eleventh it was a military post of the first importance, and that it is not till the twelfth century that we get the first hint of the coming university. As to colleges in the modern sense, nothing was heard of them till the thirteenth century. So much for King Alfred as the founder of Oxford University. The University took its rise from the students attached to various monasteries established at Oxford at various times. This is, of course, a feature which it has in common with all other similar institutions, for during many centuries education was exclusively in the hands of the clergy, and, as we have occasion to notice farther on, it is practically so in England even now, notwithstanding the religious revolution accomplished at the time of the Reformation. There is a French saying with regard to the perennity of established customs in govern mental departments, to the effect that although ministers pass and go, the clerks remain. Something of the sort seems to have taken place in England as far as the clergy as an educa tional body are concerned. The history of the University of Oxford is in many respects very similar to that of the old \"Universite de Paris,\" and we almost understand better the history of the latter and its constitution, now things of the past, when we see flourishing in the old English city the ancient and time-honoured system to which the \"Convention\" put an abrupt end by the"], [103, "OXFORD. 77 decree ofthe 20th of March, 1794, which suppressed at one stroke the University of Paris and the twenty-four provincial universities then existing in France. In Paris then, as in Oxford now, the University was a corporate body, having a rector at its head, which, with its colleges and principals grouped around, formed a sort of state within the State. The students, recognising no authority but that of the University, were as unruly as those of Oxford, and numerous were the frays between the scholars and the burgesses of old Lutetia. Rivalry between the several colleges also gave rise to quarrels, and on frequent occasions encounters took place with fatal results. Duelling was rife among Parisian students, and affairs of honour had their denouement in the Pre-aux-Clercs, situated on the left bank of the Seine, as nearly as possible where the Quai d'Orsay now stands. Whether the students of the English University were addicted to duelling we know not, and are inclined to think it was not their custom, but, like their brethren in Paris, they seem to have had a deep hatred of the Jews, who were expelled from Oxford in 1289, and to have entertained a feeling of hostility towards the worthy burgesses of Oxford, as evidenced by the continual town-and-gown riots. Bearing all this in mind, a visit to Oxford is to a Frenchman like a vision of ancient times ; it almost seems as if one had gone back some centuries, or, unlike Rip van Winkle, after having gone to sleep one night in the nineteenth, suddenly awoke in the fifteenth century in the middle of a medi\u00e6val city. The general appearance of Oxford is very striking. From the railway the domes, spires, pinnacles, and towers are seen rising above an ocean of verdure, the grey tint of the stone standing out with wonderful effect on the green colour of the foliage. At a dis tance Oxford appears as a city of churches and palaces, and as you get nearer to and enter it, the first impression, far from diminishing, is increased and heightened. A Window. The first object of importance to be met when going from the railway station to the town is an old Norman keep on a high mound, which is all that remains of the Castle, built it is said, in the reign of William Rufus ; but having seen many Norman towers and keeps of all descriptions during our trip, we were getting rather tired of them, nearly as much as of the Romans and the Roman walls. So, disdainfully glancing at the Castle, we passed rapidly by in our hurry to see the town and its celebrated High Street, of which we had heard so much."], [104, "SKETCHES OF ENGLAND. 78 We soon reached Carfax, and then before us stretched that wonderful street, the like of which is not to be seen in any other city in the world. There are wider streets and longer streets, streets with finer monuments than High Street ; but what makes the particular charm of the \" High,\" as the students of Oxford call it, is the combination of gardens and monuments, of foliage and spires and towers and pinnacles, which unite the beauties of nature and of art to form a perspective unequalled for real picturesqueness. High Street is not straight, but curves slightly to the right. This is an advantage, for as one advances the prospect changes, so to say, at every step ; it is possible, by standing at a given spot, to limit one's horizon and to take in at a glance all the characteristic features of the surrounding buildings and gardens, Avhose trees overtop the walls and project their shadows on the pavement with fairy-like effects of light and shade ; a few paces forward or backward open up new prospects, and an entirely different scene meets the eye. This ever-changing aspect of the street as one walks along is remarkably pleasant, and a welcome change from the monotony of long straight streets, which are very convenient, no doubt, but do not afford such an excellent opportunity to judge of the architectural beauties of a town. As you get nearer the various edifices, they seem to revolve and show themselves under their several aspects. First, one discovers an elegant spire proudly rising above all the surrounding edifices ; standing out boldly against the sky, the tapering and elegant steeple, ornamented at its base with delicately carved pinnacles, strikes the eye; as you approach, it seems to recede before you, and to hide behind the neighbouring houses. Suddenly you perceive the church above which the steeple rises ; a few steps more bring you before the front of St. Mary's, one of the loveliest things in Oxford. Arch\u00e6ologists and critics in general \u2014 that is to say, people who, by profession, are never satisfied \u2014 point out, it is true, that the body of the church is of the Perpendicular style of architecture, whilst the spire is Decorated, and the front Italian. Quite possible. But there is something equally true, and a good deal more interesting, and that is that the whole is absolutely charming. The porch, an elaborately decorated specimen of architecture, with its fine twisted columns, its graceful arch, ; nd still more graceful pediment, and surmounted by a statue of the Virgin and Child in a niche flanked by pilasters, is a delightful object which we never tire of admiring. Possibly the contrast it offers with the Gothic church to which it has been added enhances its appearance ; some people think so ; we have no theory on the subject. When a thing is beautiful we are content to look at it, and admire it without inquiring into the reason why it is so. St. Mary's porch was built by Archbishop Laud, and when the prelate was indicted, the erection of the statue of the Virgin was one of the counts of the indictment drawn up against him. The fate of Laud proves that his enemies had not underrated the effect of such an accusation on puritanical and tyrannical minds. It is not without reason that these two words rhyme. We cannot refrain from reproducing here a remarkable sentence we found in a book on Oxford. Speaking of this very front, the author says that the erection of it \"formed one of the counts of the indictment upon which Archbishop Laud had the misfortune to lose his head.\" Had the misfortune to lose his head struck us as a particularly felicitous mode of expressing the little accident through which Laud departed this earth."], [105, "OXFORD. 79 We should have liked to see the interior of St. Mary's Church, but seeing a notice to the effect that the keys were kept by a certain lady living in some lane the location of which was unknown to us, and fearing that we might call upon that good lady when either she was \"not at home,\" or enjoying a quiet cup of tea, we regretfully went on our way. A tower gateway immediately afterwards attracted our attention, owing more to its peculiarity than to its loveliness ; but it should be remembered that what constitutes the beauty of Oxford is less, perhaps, its monuments taken separately and examined each on its own merits, than the presence of so many of them in a comparatively small area. The illustrious French preacher, the late Pere Lacordaire, was evidently of this opinion. Punting. It was not the monuments of heterogeneous style which particularly attracted him, nor the gardens, but the combination of all these features. Oxford should not be looked at in detail for there is none of its monuments which, examined by itself, cannot be matched, and more than matched, easily and almost anywhere, but should be considered as a whole ; and it must be admitted that the ensemble it presents cannot be surpassed, if even it can be equalled. Here is what Pere Lacordaire wrote on this subject, and no better description of Oxford can be given :\u2014\" Fancy in a plain surrounded by uplands, and bathed by two rivers, a mass of monuments Gothic and Greek; churches, colleges, quadrangles, porticoes, all distributed profusely, but most gracefully, its quiet streets terminating in trees and meadows. All these"], [106, "SKETCHES OF ENGLAND. 80 buildings, consecrated to letters and science, have their gates open. The stranger enters as he would enter his own house, because they are the asylums of the beautiful to all who are endowed with feeling. As you traverse these noiseless quadrangles there is no crowding or din. There is nowhere such an appearance of ruin with so much of preservation. In Italy the buildings breathe of youth. In Oxford it is time which shows itself, but time Avithout decay, and with all its majesty. The town itself is small, but even this does not take from the grandeur of the place ; the monuments serve for houses, and give it an air of vastness.\" University College and Queen's College, a few steps farther than St. Mary's Church, are nearly opposite each other. The former has a striking facade ornamented with towers ; the latter possesses a gateway over which a cupola, supported by clusters of columns, shelters a statue of Queen Caroline, consort of George II. But it need hardly be said that this college is not named after that queen, for it dates from the fourteenth century. It Avas founded by the chaplain of Queen Philippa, wife of Edward III., who, in compliment to his royal mistress, called it Queen's College. The last college to be seen in the High Street is the celebrated Magdalen College, founded in the fifteenth century by Bishop William of Waynflete, to which access is obtained through a modern gate of Gothic architecture, very pretentious in its affected simplicity. The chief feature of this college is a square tower crowned by battlements, above which rise four pinnacles, the effect of which from the bridge at the end of the High Street is very fine. The river Cherwell laves the walls of Magdalen College, behind which are large and beautiful trees in full leaf. The combination of water, foliage, and architecture, blended together in an exquisite manner, makes of this particular part of Oxford the prettiest and most pictur esque of the whole city. Enclosed by the college buildings is a large square court or quadrangle, as they call these inner courts at Oxford. Every college has its own quadrangle, and takes pride in it. That of Magdalen College is very fine, but the largest and most beautiful of all is that of Christ Church. In the university jargon or slang used by the students of Oxford, a quad rangle is a \"quad.\" The undergraduates have an inordinate love of abbreviation, and delight in lopping off syllables of long words. We have seen the word quadrangle reduced to \"quad.\" ; Catherine Street in university parlance becomes \"Cat.\" Street; commemoration \" comrnem.\" ; undergraduate \" undergrad.\" ; and so on ad infinitum, to make use of a Latin expression quite in keeping with the subject we are treating. Let us return to Magdalen (Avhich, for some mysterious reason, is pronounced Maudlen), its \"quads.\" and cloisters, ornamented with quaint emblematical sculptures, chiefly of ani mals belonging to species unknown to naturalists, but which testify to the originality and imagination of the artists who carved them. The Founder's tower, clothed with ivy and creeping plants, is a conspicuous and interesting feature in this quadrangle. As there are twenty colleges in Oxford, and it Avould have been impossible to visit them all unless we remained a few weeks in the venerable and learned city, we had, as the English say, to draw the line somewhere. We therefore wandered along the streets, noticing as we passed the great gates of the schools, the gateway of New College and that of Brasenose,"], [107, "OXFORD. 81 as well a^ the brazen nose, Avhich irresistibly reminded us of a comic personage created by the fancy of a London caricaturist, to whose sayings and doings a whole paper is every week entirely devoted. After many turns in the streets and in the gardens situated between the Cherwell and the Isis, we traversed the New Walk and the magnificent Broad Walk, shaded by splendid old trees, with the intention of visiting Christ Church College and the Cathedral. For Oxford is the head of a diocese, and has a bishop. By a curious arrangement, the chapel of Christ Church is also the Cathedral ; or if it is thought more becoming to put it another way, the Cathedral serves as a chapel to Christ Church College. Probably the first description is adopted by the college authorities, whilst the Bishop prefers the second. The Bishop of Oxford, by the way, does not live at Oxford, but at a place called Cuddesdon Palace, a few miles off. It is a remarkable fact that English archbishops and bishops generally live any where except in the city which is supposed to be their see. As we went round by the meadows and the banks of the river, we had a glimpse of out door university life. Like all young Englishmen, undergraduates and students are passion ately fond of exercise and of all kinds of sports, and more especially of athletic sports. LaAvn tennis appears to be quite a favourite pastime with them, if we are to judge by the number of students to be met with in the streets in \" flannels \" and lawn-tennis shoes and caps, and carrying racquets, bats, and balls. In some gardens we happened to pass by, a number of students and young ladies were playing tennis with great ardour ; one young lady in particular displayed much grace and a great proficiency in the handling of the bat. A party of young people of both sexes indulging in this pleasant sport is a very pretty sight. The light costumes of the players, male and female, throw pleasant patches of colour on the green SAvard, and stand out on the dark foliage to excellent effect, while the graceful movements of the ladies contrast with, and seem to bring out with more prominence, the vigour, strength, and skill of the men. On the banks of the Isis (which the English pronounce almost like the word \"ices\") another and more* striking, because newer scene, met our eyes. It was a boat's crew practis ing, whilst on the other bank the coach, on horseback, was directing their movements. How fond the English are of rowing is well known, but cannot be realised unless one sees the care, the attention, and the energy with which the students of Oxford and, we suppose, of Cambridge, train themselves in order to be deemed sufficiently skilful to take part in the famous race between the eight of Oxford and the eight of Cambridge, which is one of the great functions of the year. We wondered, as we saw them rowing under the coach's direc tions, how many French students could be got to undergo the same course of hard training, involving as it does a certain amount of privation, and a special diet and mode of living for weeks and even months. And we came to the conclusion that although many French etudiants are in the habit of canoter, and belong to rowing clubs, yet they would give up the sport from the moment it ceased to be an amusement to become a kind of labour. In other words, whereas the young Englishman rows with a purpose and with an object in vieAV, other than his OAvn personal enjoyment and satisfaction, and for that purpose joins the boat's creAV M"], [108, "SKETCHES OF ENGLAND. 82 of his college or university in the hope of sustaining or avenging the reputation of one or the other, the young Frenchman rows because it pleases him, but would not for a moment dream of training himself for the sake of winning a race for the glory of his college. Whether for political or social purposes the English must club together; this is a fact Avhich is constantly and vividly illustrated by their every-day life, even as seen by strangers in a flying visit ; the French, on the contrary, although they may be more sociable, are much less clubable than the English. And yet there is a good deal more of initiative and private enterprise in England than in France. Who shall explain this curious contradiction in the idiosyncrasies of both peoples ? It was our intention to visit Christ Church College, but before getting there we wan dered on the river banks, and ultimately found our way to Folly Bridge, and thence, passing along St. Aldate Street, arrived at the college. Before entering we gave a look to the house of Bishop King, which reminded us of the constructions of the same kind so numerous in Chester, and does not call for any special notice. Christ Church College is entered from St. Aldate Street by a fine gateway formed of a Gothic arch, above which is a pretty mullioned window. Two elegant towers, one at each side, flank the gate, and rise to the level of the window ; and a third and bigger tower sur mounts the whole. The three toAvers are capped by elegant piriform cupolas, and the effect of the whole is graceful and striking, the more so as the proportions of the gate are as perfect as could be wished. The quadrangle is bounded on its four sides by the college buildings, which are not particularly beautiful, but they bear the impress of the great mind of the man who built Hampton Court, and whose liberality and love of show, pomp, and splendour have seldom been equalled, that is, of Cardinal Wolsey, the founder of Christ Church, whose statue adorns the Tom Gate. For although the illustrious cardinal fell into disgrace, King Henry VIII. adopted his plans, and had them carried out on the lines laid down by Wolsey. The colleges of Oxford pride themselves on their halls, and that of Christ Church \u2014 the only one we saw, because we were told it is the finest of all\u2014 is a Gothic apartment with a remarkable oak roof, elaborately carved, the principal motive of the decoration being the arms and badge of Henry VIII. The Avails are hung with portraits of historical personages, foremost among whom, as a matter of course, are those of Cardinal Wolsey and Henry VIII., both attributed to Holbein. Queen Elizabeth also is here represented, and looks as ungracious as she possibly can. An important event in English history took place in this hall, where Charles I. assembled some hundred and fifty peers and commoners \u2014 his partisans \u2014 who sat there in opposition to the Parliament of Westminster ; but beyond the record of the fact, there is nothing in the hall itself to recall this incident. The cathedral, which, as we have said before, is the college chapel, can only be seen at stated times, during which the verger is in attendance to take visitors round. It did not quite come up to our expectations. It is an edifice of Norman architecture, uniform in shape, and composed of a nave, choir, aisles, and transept of various periods. Originally"], [109, "OXFORD. 83 the church of the priory of St. Frideswide, it was partly remodelled by Wolsey, whose intention it was to build a larger and finer church, and subsequently altered, re paired, and added to at different times ; hence the somewhat straggling appear ance of the church. The choir, notably, has been almost wholly restored during the last twenty years, and other portions of the cathedral have equally undergone re pair. As a matter of course there are a great number of tablets, brasses, and monu ments, most of which are re markably uninteresting from an artistic point of view, al though they recall the memory of some of England's most learned and accom plished scholars, whose works, fortunately, consti tute better, worthier, and more durable monuments than those in Christ Church Cathedral. In the chapel adjacent to the choir, our attention was called to several tombs of the fourteenth and fif teenth century, the oldest being that of a prior of St. Frideswide,whodiedin 1316, and whose effigy is a curious example of old painted sculp ture, some specimens of Taking a Constitutional. M 2"], [110, "SKETCHES OF ENGLAND. 84 which are to be found in many ancient churches. There are some well-preserved monuments of the same kind at Rochester and at York. Another tomb of considerable interest is that of Lady Elizabeth de Montacute, on which is a recumbent figure of the lady in the costume of the fourteenth century. It is ornamented with curious panels Avith small statuettes of saints, and other sculptures of angels, birds, and heraldic devices. The Shrine of St. Frideswide, an elaborately carved wooden structure, is among the curiosities of Christ Church Cathedral, which, as Ave have said before, is a somewhat dis appointing edifice. On the other hand, the Radcliffe Library, a fine building surmounted by an elegant dome, struck us as the best monument in Oxford, as it is the best situated. It stands in a square or garden, and is the centre of a cluster of collegiate and other buildings, above Avhich it rises majestically. This part of the town is to a stranger the most striking and characteristic. The Radcliffe Library now serves as a reading-room, the collection of books it once contained having been removed to the library of the new University Museum and to the Bodleian Library, which occupies the north side of the square. The last- mentioned library, like the Ashmolean Museum, is too well-known an institution for us to attempt a description of it ; its fame is universal, and any comments Ave might indulge in would be either inadequate or out of place. We must, however, note that it is open only to the graduates of the University, or to persons provided with a proper recommendation. This is strictly in accordance with the English system ; but one would have thought that a library of that kind Avould be throAvn open to all students of Oxford Avithout any recommendation or introduction being required ; the simple fact of being a member of the University \"would in any other country be a sufficient title to admission within its Avails. The Bodleian Library contains 450,000 volumes and 30,000 MSS., and is constantly being enriched with neAV books, either by bequest or in compliance with an Act of Parliament which obliges every English publisher to present a copy of all the books published by him. This must be a heavy tax on English publishers, inasmuch as the Public Library at Cambridge, the British Museum, Trinity College, Dublin, and the Advocates' Library at Edinburgh also receive a copy each of every edition of every work published in the United Kingdom. In addition to these libraries, which are the property of the University, the colleges also possess collections of books, so that with these and the Museums and the various scientific collections belonging to the different institutions, Oxford is provided with means of acquiring literary and scientific information such as are equalled by few centres of learning. Interesting as is Oxford from the picturesque standpoint, on account of its situation, of its buildings, of its ancient origin, and of the remarkable manner in which it has preserved its character through ages and the vicissitudes of time, there are other and more important points in connection with it which strike forcibly even the most superficial observer. In the first place, it is quite evident that there is no such thing as the city of Oxford. Oxford is the University and the University is Oxford ; the two are practically one, as the town Avithout the University could not exist. The shops are clearly kept going by the students"], [111, "OXFORD. 85 and not by the townspeople ; the fashionable tailors, hatters, bootmakers, hosiers, saddlers, and others have apparently no customers but the undergraduates, as evidenced by the style of their wares. The private houses even, or at least a great many of them, are only so in appearance, and their owners earn their living chiefly by letting apartments to the students Avho cannot be accommodated in the college buildings. The elegance of the articles exposed for sale in the various shops point to a wealthy population, and the natural inferenca is that the students are, for the greater part, very well off. This is true of most of them, for life at an English uniATersity is expensive ; college education is not Avithin the reach of everybody, and is practically reserved for a limited few. In speaking of Oxford and of Cambridge the old Latin adage should be remembered : Non licet omnibus adire Corinthian. It is not, indeed, every head of a family\u2014 and families are proverbially large in England\u2014 Avho can afford to pay some \u00a3200 a year to keep a son at one of the universities, the more so as the aca demical year is divided into four terms of about eight weeks each, three of which only, on an aver age, are spent at college. The re sult is that for about five months in the year under graduates are at home or travel, and the above sum only covers the expenses of Oxford. the seven months or so during which they reside at Oxford. If to these academical expenses we add the numerous subscriptions to clubs and societies, which, although they are voluntary, are so common that a student finds it hard not to incur them, because he is expected to do as others, and the tradesmen's bills and personal expenses, it will readily be understood that a young Englishman of ordinary disposition, who is neither a spendthrift nor a miser, cannot cost much less than \u00a3300 a year to his family whilst he is in the University. In the \" Student's Handbook to the University of Oxford,\" a little volume full of interesting information, which we purchased at Oxford, we find that the \" battels \" of an economical man may be under \u00a380 yearly. That is for three terms of eight weeks. Ordinary battels including only rent of rooms, board, and university and college dues, there remain many other expenses to be provided for, such as washing, light, beer or wine at meals, books, the cost of living during the vacations, and pocket money. We are not"], [112, "SKETCHES OF ENGLAND. 86 going into further details on the subject, which we only mention because it shows that in England higher education is, like many other things, an affair of class ; that university training is beyond the reach of the masses, who are, in consequence, deprived of many advantages which young men belonging to aristocratic and wealthy families alone enjoy. The very composition of the academical council points to the aristocratic character of English universities. The Chancellors are not men of learning or renowned for their literary or scientific attainments, but simply gentlemen of social eminence, such as dukes, marquises, or earls. At Oxford the Chancellor is the Marquis of Salisbury ; at Cambridge the same position is held by the Duke of Devonshire ; and the High Stewards at both universities are earls. We are quite aAvare that the posts of Chancellors and High Stewards are purely honorary ; but that is no excuse for selecting men whose only recommendation is that they have a title and a large fortune. Surely England can boast a number of literary and scientific men, the honour and pride of English letters and science, whose names ought to be found at the head of the list of university magnates. But no. A duke or a marquis at the head of an English university is a much more becoming personage according to British notions than a Ruskin, a Freeman, a Jowett, a Huxley, or a Tennyson (although reduced to the position of a peer), a Max Miiller, or a Seeley, to mention at random a few only of the celebrated English litterateurs and scientists whose names are as familiar to foreigners as they are to Englishmen. But then such men are only great men, whilst a duke or a marquis is a big man, and, of course, the latter is preferred to the former. Yet, with every respect to the present Chancellors of both universities, it may be safely predicted that their names will be unknown to posterity, whilst the memory of the men we have just mentioned will for ever be remembered as being among those of England's most illustrious sons. English universities, having become class institutions, have, for this reason, degenerated, for they were originally founded with the object of giving instruction to all, rich and poor alike. In the thirteenth century, there were, it is recorded, thirty thousand students at Oxford, including, of course, boys, as universities in those times gave both primary and higher education. Nowadays they only promote higher education, it is true, but taking into account the increase in the population of the country, the number of students at Oxford (about three thousand) is ridiculously small. Then again the number of degrees conferred is out of proportion with the population, for in a twelvemonth only some five hundred degrees of B.A. are granted. Compare these figures with the number of bacheliers-es-lettres and bacheliers-es-sciences yearly turned out in France \u2014 Paris alone has about three thousand five hundred\u2014 and it will be seen that, whereas education in that country is truly democratic and within the reach of the poorest, it is, in England, confined to privileged classes. Let us add, however, that in England the B.A. degree is not, as the baccalaureat is with us, the indispensable stepping-stone to all professions and Government appointments. A man may become a doctor, a barrister, or a clerk in the various Government offices without being a B.A. All that is required of him is that he shall qualify for the profession he wishes to embrace or the post he is desirous of obtaining by passing certain examinations. This system, of course, is pointed to by the English as a very democratic one, and so it is to some"], [113, "OXFORD. s7 extent ; but it would be better to throw the universities open to a greater number of students, so as to enable young men of humble birth to reap the advantage of higher education. No doubt, as we have just seen, this does not prevent them from becoming doctors, lawyers, barristers, judges, or even lord chan cellors ; but then, if university educa tion canbe dispensed wdth by men who aspire to these pro fessions and digni ties, what is the use of it ; and why should it be main tained for the special satisfaction and be hoof of the privi leged classes, wdiose sons can boast that they have been at Oxford or at Cam bridge ? If, however, uni versity education is not indispensable to men who adopt the naval, military, legal, or medical professions, those whose vocation in clines towards the Church or towards teaching find it difficult to rise to any eminence in either of those two professions unless The May Term. Furnishing Window Boxes they can add to their name the initials M.A. or D.D., especially the latter, for in England education is almost exclusively in the hands of the clergy, who, inheriting the traditions of the Church of Rome, have, in spite of the religious revolution effected in"], [114, "SKETCHES OF ENGLAND. 88 England, retained in their hands and under their control the fashioning of the English mind. The number of men who go through Oxford and Cambridge universities is, as we have seen, but small, comparatively speaking, but it is amply sufficient to provide the public and private schools of the kingdom with principals and head masters, and the Established Church Avith its clergy and dignitaries. The influence of the universities is thus directly and indirectly making itself felt throughout the length and* breadth of England to a degree unparalleled in any other country in Europe. The uniA-ersities are lay bodies in name only, for all the important posts are filled by clergymen, and nearly all the heads of colleges arc members of the clergy. The same rule applies to public and private schools, the principals of which are also mostly clergymen. It follows, therefore, that the Church, Avhich directs the universities, and through them the educational establishments of England, is virtually the mistress of English education which she controls, and as a natural consequence, the English mind and thought are under her immediate and powerful influence. This is one of the most extraordinary facts of modern history, and it is impossible for any one to understand certain English idiosyncrasies, certain peculiarities of English life and character, until one has seen an English university. With that truly British quality, tenacity, the English clergy, whilst discarding Avhatever principles and rules of the Church of Rome appeared to them objectionable, and led to the Reformation, managed to retain, and in some instances to regain, the substantial advantages conferred upon that church at various times. One of the most valuable and important was to hold in their hands what may be termed the monopoly of teaching. A long time before it was said by a great European statesman that one of the decisive battles of modern times had been won by the schoolmasters, the clergy had found out that, in order to be all-powerful, they must have the exclusive privilege of educating the young, of shaping their minds, and directing their thoughts. Thus from generation to generation men's minds have been trained by them, and by them kept within bounds and well-defined limits. Human thought was fashioned according to the wrants and purposes of the Church, whose influence was paramount in Europe. The English clergy, who were the first to revolt against that supreme authority, succeeded in making the people believe that the enfranchisement of the clergy from Papal fetters meant the enfranchisement of the people as well ; but whilst some hundred years ago a great upheaval freed human thought from all clerical influence throughout Europe, unostentatiously but firmly, the English clergy have retained on English education and thought that hold which they inherited, together with other advantages, from their Romish predecessors. As in Government offices, the Secretary of State was changed, but the officials and official traditions remained. The Pope was shelved and the King took his place as the head of the Church ; but the rank and file of the clergy managed not to lose any particle of their influence. And thus it is that at the close of the nineteenth century the Established Church of England is just as powerful and exercises as great a moral and intellectual influence over English thought as ever did the monks of old in other countries. As a matter of course it follows that in the programme of university education religious"], [115, "OXFORD. 89 subjects hold an important place. Among the subjects of examination for the degree of B.A. the books of the Old and New Testament, the Holy Gospels, and the Acts of the Apostles are required in the original Greek, as well as the Thirty-nine Articles of religion agreed upon in the Convocation holden at London in 1502, and which are the foundation upon Avhich the whole edifice of the Established Church rests. A candidate of full age, or his parents and guardians if he be a minor, can object on religious grounds to an examination on the Thirty nine Articles; but as the only alternative is an examination on such subjects as the Epistle to the Galatians, or the Ecclesiastical History of the Third Century, the fact remains that theology and religious subjects play an important part in university education and examina tions. This is certainly sufficient to account for that ecclesiastical and puritanical turn of mind of which Englishmen can never divest themselves, even in their most independent moods, save in very rare instances. It is reported that an English humourist, on being called upon in his university days to subscribe to the Thirty-nine Articles, according to the custom then preArailing, readily answered : \" Certainly ; forty, if you like.\" This is too good to be true, for it would require more moral courage and independence than most young men possess for an undergraduate to venture on making such a reply to the awe-inspiring Doctors of Divinity of an English university. In later life, no doubt, Englishmen to some extent shake off that puritanism, but they never can get rid of it entirely, the early imprint being too deeply sunk in their minds. It remains in another form, under the guise of a delicacy of feeling, of a sense of propriety ; but there it is, nevertheless. It reminds one of the manners peculiar to seminarists who have thrown off the cowl and become laymen, but without their gentleness. The effects of this religious training are conspicuously noticeable in English books and newspaper articles, as well as in their private conversation. Biblical allusions and quotations are constantly recurring : they come to the lips or under the pen naturally, without effort, because the memory is full of them. They are also to be met with in anecdotes, jokes, and even in those stories which men are fond of telling in their post-prandial talk, whilst sipping their claret and enjoying a cigar or pipe. It can be asserted wdthout exaggeration that half or perhaps two-thirds ofthe inexhaustible fund of English \"funny stories\" are based upon or inspired by some Biblical incident or relate to some personage mentioned in the Scriptures. More than once it has been our privilege to be present at dinners where men only were invited, and after the first experience, which took us by surprise, we looked forward with much amusement to the witching hour Avhen a bolder man than the others would be telling the first \" good story.\" The scene is irresistibly funny : the listeners crowding round the talker the furtive glances thrown by the latter, and the subdued tone of the voice, hushed almost to a whisper, remind one of those secret confabs of schoolboys afraid of being over- heard by their master. There can be no doubt that the same monastic discipline of their universities leaves an everlasting impression on the minds, habits, and customs of Englishmen. Whether this is right or wrong, good or bad, advisable or the reverse, is a matter of the utmost indifference ; we draw no conclusion and make no comparisons ; we note a fact which struck us most N"], [116, "SKETCHES OF ENGLAND. 90 forcibly, and which threw a flood of light on certain traits of the English character which had hitherto remained unintelligible to us. It is a very remarkable thing that whereas the English educational system gives the younger boys at public schools considerable freedom, it places the groAvn-up student under a special discipline of a very strict kind, as far as we could see. It is just the other way Avith us, and we should be very sorry to say which of the two systems is to be preferred. It seems to us that, in matters of this kind, nothing could well be more unwise than to judge either system by the standard of the other country, and that it must be assumed that each system is the natural outcome of special conditions of life and of the social organization of the country which has adopted it, and is peculiar to the people. In consequence of the strict discipline of English universities and of the supervision exercised on the students, Oxford is very different from the old French universities, Avhose escholiers were a rather unruly lot, and has, at all times, a very quiet and decorous aspect. The streets are as dull and academical looking as need be, and were it not for the cap and gOAvn worn by the students and some of the officials, one Avould never think that la jeunesse des ecoles forms such an important proportion of the inhabitants. Not only are the students required to wear the prescribed academical dress at stated hours in the public streets and at all times within the precincts of the schools, but they are not allowed to frequent hotels or taverns except for reasons to be approved by the Vice-Chancellor or Proctor. The latter is entrusted wdth the police of the town, as far as the students and members of the university are concerned, and the Vice- Chancellor is the president of a court or tribunal before which the students are brought in case of breach of discipline on their part. In addition to that, the Vice-Chancellor's court is also a civil and criminal tribunal ; the universities enjoying, like the old French universities, civil and criminal jurisdiction in all matters affecting their resident members. We have not a copy of the University Code, but we are told that students are not allowed to smoke in the streets, nor to engage in any games of chance, nor to bet on horse races ; we are also informed that, as far as the betting is concerned, the rule is more often broken than observed, and that usurers and money-lenders are not unknown at Oxford and Cambridge. These regulations are unobjectionable, but the following rules appear somewhat excessive. For instance, no student is allowed to leave Oxford (we quote from the \" Student's Handbook to the University of Oxford \") for the day without the consent of the censor or his tutor, even if unattached to any college or hall ; nor is a student to engage lodgings without the sanction of the delegates. As all lodging-houses have to be licensed by the delegates, the necessity for this rule is not ob\\dous, inasmuch as all students are bound to enter their address in a book kept at the censor's office. In addition to that, the lodging-house keepers, who (after the Russian system, which makes of all porters and door-keepers so many police spies) are a kind of officious secret agents, are bound to report to the delegates any student who is out of his lodgings after 10 p.m. or before 6 a.m., for no undergraduate is allowed to leave his rooms except between"], [117, "OXFORD. 91 the regulation hours. The students are also enjoined to abstain from frequenting hotels and taverns. All these rules are very wise, no doubt, but they seem to be applicable rather to schoolboys than to the big burly fellows to be met with in the streets of Oxford. They have, besides, an inquisitorial and prying character which is anything but edifying or calculated to promote self-respect. Finally, they appear to have been draAvn up more for seminarists than for young men of the world. We wondered, as we Avere told these things, how such a regime would work on the Continent ; and avc should have liked to knoAV, but could not ascertain, whether the stringent regulations of English universities are really effective, or whether, like so many other things, they are a mere blind, destined to make people believe that, because they cannot actually see a thing, it follows that it does not exist. We strongly suspect that there is a good deal of truth in that surmise, but our inquiries on the subject, although made in our best, most circumlocutory, and most diplomatic style, were of no avail. We could elicit no information, and only succeeded in darkening the benevolent features of our informant, whose astonishment at seeing that we had some doubts as to the angelical virtues of English university students bordered on indignation. There are things in England which must not even be hinted at, and which no one seems to understand, although everybody knows perfectly what you are alluding to ; this make-believe process deceives no one, and is a rather comical affair when once you get used to it, as by provoking it with some amount of skill one may turn it into a source of endless enjoyment of a selfish but very entertaining nature. The whole educational system of England being in the hands of the clergy, it would be passing strange, indeed, if it had not on the nation a marked effect, and it can be traced in that almost uniform disposition of mind so remarkable among Englishmen, whose ways of thinking and manner of expressing themselves are so curiously alike. We have been told by an old resident in England that it is possible in given circumstances to foretell exactly what precise answer an Englishman will make, or what course of action he will take, and Ave can quite believe it. But until we had an idea of what an English university and the educational system of the country are, such a statement would have been wholly unintelligible. The very noticeable caution displayed by Englishmen in their every-day dealings among themselves or wdth strangers can also be ascribed to their clerical education, and we say so because it is very similar to the way in which men who have been brought up by priests or in seminaries are in the habit of speaking. It does not require more than a few days' sojourn in England to notice how seldom English people make use of a direct affirmative or negative. \"I believe,\" \"I think,\" \"I suppose,\" are about the nearest approach to an affirmative it is customary for them to employ ; yes or no, when used, being generally qualified by one of these expressions. Now this is essentially a clerical manner of talking, imparted to them by their clerical teachers, and inherited by the latter from their pre decessors, the monks. And yet Englishmen, forgetting these facts, look with pity on what they are pleased to call the priest-ridden nations of the Continent. There is certainly no people under the sun whose political and social life is more directly influenced by the clergy than the English ; but they have been told that they were in this respect infinitely better off n2"], [118, "SKETCHES OF ENGLAND. 92 than other nations, and they believe it, and they are comdnced of it, and no argument will ever shake that belief until the educational system has been wholly modified under the influence of modern ideas, which are now slowly but gradually asserting themselves even in aristocratic and conservative England. It seems a pity that, owing to the class character of its universities, England should Avilfully deprive herself of the services of men of humble birth who, had they the opportunity of following the course of studies at Oxford or Cambridge, might shed lustre on their country by their ability, learning, and science, and possibly open up to English thought neAV channels by getting rid of the well-worn grooves and beaten tracks, and infuse neAV blood in the personnel of the educational body. But before such an end can be attained a complete change in the social conditions of the country will probably have to be effected, and the chances are that a long time will be required to bring it about. Social reforms arc longer and more difficult to introduce than political ones, as English history shoAVS, and as its present condition sufficiently evidences. There is no doubt, for instance, that the Commons can hold their own against the Lords, and even compel the latter to yield, as in 1807 and in 1885, to mention only two instances well known to foreigners, but socially it cannot be denied that the members of the Upper House and their families exercise in the country an influence altogether out of proportion to their personal and intellectual abilities. It Avould be easier to get the aristocratic classes to give manhood suffrage to the masses than to allow them to drive in cabs in Hyde Park. But, to return to our contention, are not the diplomatic service, the army, the navy, and the clergy of the Established Church careers in which the classes, especially in the higher ranks of each and every one of them, predominate to a considerable extent ? True men Avho do not belong to the classes occasionally rise to great eminence, but then Avhat happens ? They are immediately absorbed into the classes by means of royal letters patent, creating them peers of the realm, and then. . . . And then they become, in the majority of cases, more royalist than the king. Even one of the greatest minds of the century, one of the finest poets England has ever known, could not resist being made a lord, a member of the peerage. It is not to be supposed that the social reform we allude to as having to precede a change in the university system can take place within measurable distance, if we bear in mind the present state of the English social edifice ; but there are symptoms Avhich show that influences are at work which aim at radical changes. Oxford and Cambridge are evidently two of the strongest pillars on which rests English society as at present constituted; on account of their aristocratic and exclusive character their influence, extending through the clergy and the educational bodies from one end of the kingdom to the other, enables them morally and intellectually to rule the country with a power Avhich is the more redoubtable because of its occult and insidious character. It is used, as a matter of course, in favour of the classes, not necessarily against the masses but to their exclusion. The aristocracy dispose of a very large proportion of the livings and Church patronage is one of their most valued appanages as everybody knoAVS. On the other"], [119, "OXFORD. 93 hand, Ave have seen Avhat an important part the clergy play in the educational system of modern England. The inference is obvious, tho facts speak for themselves, and no one can entertain any doubt as to the essentially aristocratic character of English universities. When the universities of England are modified in their constitution, the educational system Avill undergo radical changes, and the whole of the social fabric will be reformed. Whether such a change be desirable or not is a matter of opinion, but it is certain that the tendencies of the present time are all tOAvards the democratisation of all institutions, political and social. England has been in the van, politically speaking, but not socially ; how long can she hold out is the question we asked ourselves. For we must say that we were considerably more im pressed with the University, its constitution, power, and influence, and its important functions in the economy of the country, than Avith the picturesqueness of the monu ments and the streets of Oxford. The antiquity of the buildings and the manner in which they have stood the test of ages struck us less than the perennial existence of the University itself, in the con stitution of which time has had so little effect that, in spite of the revolutions the civilised Avorld has seen, re ligious, social, and political, it has stood unharmed and escaped unscathed. More solid A Bit of Magdalen College. and immovable than the oldest monument in the city of Oxford, the University, with its tremendous power, influence, privileges, and prejudices, with its aristocratic, clerical, and exclusive character, has never for a moment released its hold on English minds or ceased to sway English thought. That is certainly more striking than the edifices with which the town abounds, picturesque and beautiful as they are, and it made on us a much deeper impression."], [120, "CHAPTER VII. YORK. ORK is as decorous and dull as Canterbury, if not more so. At any rate it is a close race between the two cities, and he must be a bold man Avho would 0?MJu^ decide which of the t*wo carries the palm for dulness. As for the people of York, they are solemn to a degree which it would be difficult to exaggerate. The Avaiters at the hotel, as they serve the dinners, seem to be performing some religious ceremony; they hand you a plate of soup with unction, roast beef with gravity, and potatoes with impressiveness. Dessert they pla\"ce on the table reproachfully, as if it Avere sinful to indulge in such trifles ; and as to cigarettes, and whiskey diluted with seltzer, you cannot obtain it unless you produce a doctor's prescription. To get from the hotel to the town one has to cross over the Lendal Bridge, a \\*ery small structure, the river Ouse being narroAV, and to pay one half-penny. From the bridge there is a fine view of the toAvn and the river, on the banks of which is the Mansion House ; and beyond, the Minster towers high above every building in the city. So say the guide-books. The bridge we found without difficulty, but as to the Cathedral, we looked, but could not see it ; so we turned round and looked in another direction, thinking Ave had mistaken the information given to us as to the situation of the Minster, but Ave were equally unsuccessful. The fact is that a very thick mist enveloped the town, and the density of it was so great that the huge mass of the Cathedral was entirely hidden from view. It may here be mentioned that when the people of the provinces find fault with the London climate because it is foggy, and unblushingly assert that \" it is only in London that one sees such fogs,\" they are entirely mistaken or wanting in candour. The fact is that the country is just about as bad as London in that respect, a clear atmosphere being as seldom met Avith in the provinces as in the metropolis, the only difference, as far as we could judge, being that they call \"mist\" in the country what is termed \"fog\" by the Londoners. Between fog and mist there is very little difference, both being equally unpleasant. As it was early morning, there was every hope that the fog\u2014 we beg the Yorkshire people's pardon\u2014 the mist would soon disappear, and we decided to walk round the town and have a look at the wTalls and bars. The bars are the gates of the old city, and very remarkable they are, as being excellent specimens of the military architecture of the fourteenth century ; they are connected by the Avails, which are very much like the walls of Chester, but not so well preserved as they do not completely surround the city. At Chester, once on the ramparts, you can"], [121, "YORK 95 make the whole circuit and return to your starting point without leaving the Avails; not so at York, where you have to go up and down several times, as there are points where there is no access to the walls, or \" no thoroughfare,\" when once you get on them. The most picturesque of these gates is Micklegate Bar. It has a fine Norman arch, flanked by two turrets with cross-shaped loopholes, and is crowned by battlements, on which are curious figures representing men-at-arms in various attitudes. At a distance these stone warriors look very well, and might almost be taken for sentries or watch men. The gate is also ornamented with several shields and other armorial devices. One of the bars, the Walm gate Bar, has still its barbican, which has remained intact ; but it is far from being equal to the Micklegate Bar in interest or for beauty of aspect and proportion. The Castle is a modern building, or rather a number of buildings, of no great interest or picturesqueness, and after a short glance at it we hastened to enter the city and to wander in the streets. We were greatly disappointed to find that in the narrow, tortuous, and dirty streets of York there Avere hardly any old buildings or houses, except in College Street and Stonegate, where a few examples of ancient architecture, with overhanging storeys, still remain, and seem almost to hide themselves in dark corners, as if ashamed to be seen. In most old cities in England the ancient buildings are numerous, gene rally interesting, and easily found. In York, on the contrary, one has to York Minster from the Waxes undertake a real exploration before meeting with anything worth looking at, and even that is very little and of very slender merit. During our stay in York we spent a Saturday in the city. Saturday being market clay, we thought the town would look more gay and animated, but there again Ave were doomed to be disappointed. All the animation we saw was caused by a number of pigs and geese being driven through the streets ; both pigs and geese Avere very noisy, and that was all."], [122, "SKETCHES OF ENGLAND. 96 As to the fashionable, or genteel part of the town, in the vicinity of the Cathedral, we found it dolefully desert, sileir, and quiet. We inquired where was the palace of the Arch bishop, the Primate of England\u2014 not of all England, remember, that being the title of his Grace of Canterbury\u2014 and we were told that his Grace of York does not live at York, but at a place where he has a large and beautiful palace, called Bisliopthorpe. This struck us as particularly wise on the part of the Archbishop, who, like his colleague of Canterbury, pre fers to live out of the capital of his diocese. It must be admitted that if the English compelled their Archbishops to live at Canterbury or York, they would deserve the reputa tion of being the most cruel and uncharitable people on the face of the earth ; for Iioav any one can live in either of these two cities, Avho is not by law or some irresistible power compelled so to do, is a mystery. At York, as at Canterbury, it is remarkable that the number of young people to be met is very small, the population being to all appearance mostly composed of old people and small children. As to animation, there is none ; and in this respect York is, like all other cathedral cities, a half-fossilised place. Why are all cathedral toAvns in such a state of decline, is a question to Avhich we cannot give an answer, but of the fact there can be no possible doubt, and it Avould be interesting if some one would find and give an explanation of this curious social law. There is, we were told, a prophecjr relating to the city Avhich says \u2014 \" Lincoln was, London is, but York shall be, The greatest city of the three.\" We very much doubt it ; but Avhen it is, if ever, then the British empire shall be reduced to very small proportions. In the meantime London seems to be progressing at a very fair rate, and York must bestir if it has any idea of setting up as a rival to the huge metropolis on the Thames. Our faith in prophets has never been very great, but all things considered, the gentleman Avho ventured on this rash prediction would be likely to bring great discredit (in the profession to which he belongs, if other and better-knoAvn members of it had not already acquitted themselves of the task Avith complete success. As a matter of course, all the interest centres on the Cathedral, the celebrated and far famed York Minster, which stands not in the centre of the city, but in the angle formed by the meeting of the old north-west and north-east walls. The approaches on the west and south sides are convenient, but not on the other sides ; a large space in front of the edifice is cleared of all buildings, and although it would be infinitely better if it were larger, still a good view of the Minster can be had. The first impression on seeing the Cathedral is one of wonder at its enormous size, and particularly at the height of the roof; there is something stupendous in its massive proportions, in the immense size of the square tower, a ponderous donjon crowned with battlements, having the appearance of a fortress. We have seen larger churches than York Minster, yet feAv struck us to the same extent on account of their size ; this is possibly due to the fact that the surrounding houses are very small. The west front is remarkable for its elegance and harmonious proportions, and fully deserves the praises that have been lavished upon it by arch\u00e6ologists, architects, and artists."], [123, "FORK. 97 A careful examination of its details is one of the most interesting studies that can be made of ecclesmstical architecture, and a more excellent specimen of the decorative style it would The Shambles, Yore. be difficult to find. Standing before the Minster, the west front gives to the observer a very accurate idea of the interior disposition and size of the edifice. The centre portion o"], [124, "98 SKETCHES OF ENGLAND. composed of a portal surmounted by a lofty window ornamented with tracery of very beautiful design, above Avhich rises a pediment equally decorated, shows exactly the height of the roof ; whilst the buttresses Avhich separate the centre portion of the front from the two toAvers indicate the width of the immense nave. The towers are the continuation of the aisle, of which they denote the precise dimensions. The front portal is usually closed, and the Cathedral is entered by the south transept. The entrance we found carefully guarded by policemen and vergers, whose presence somewhat surprised us, but we soon understood why they were there. England was, and is noAV, suffering from an unreasonable and unreasoned dynamite scare, which seems to have turned the heads of all the officials, from the Custom House officers one meets on setting foot on British soil, to the Speaker of the House of Commons, a mighty personage in a full bottomed wig, such as was worn in the time of Louis XIV., who does not allow strangers to visit the Houses of Parliament, because he is afraid that they might deposit a small packet of dynamite under his chair. At York the dynamite scare prevailed as everywhere else, and people were prohibited from entering the Cathedral with bags, parcels, or coats on their arms, or else they must submit to a close examination of their bags, parcels, or coats by the policemen on duty. The interior of the minster is even more striking than the exterior, and although a careful observer can form some idea of the height of the edifice from its external aspect, the reality more than fulfils his expectations. The nave, which is a few inches within one hundred feet in height, is of proportionate length, nearly three hundred feet. It is difficult, at first, to grasp the enormous dimensions of this portion of the Cathedral, but they soon become apparent, and the more closely the nave is examined the greater is the impression of vastness produced on the mind. Striking as it is, York Minster has not the harmonious and imposing effect of the Cathedral of Canter- bury ; vast it undoubtedly is, but it is also unsatisfactory from various points of view ; and its immense dimensions make it appear more naked and bare than English churches generally are. It has a depressing effect, which gradually becomes intolerable. Fortunately the eye experiences a welcome sensation of relief when, after examining the tall and rather slender piers, the arches, the vaulting, and the roof, it rests on the magnificent windoAv over the great western entrance, a splendid example of flowing tracery of most graceful design. It is filled with old stained glass dating from the fourteenth century, and divided into three roAvs, the lowest of which contains eight figures representing archbishops and bishops ; above them is a second row of saints, and the third row contains smaller figures. The rich colouring of the stained glass is of great beauty, and the contrast between modern and ancient stained glass is perhaps more striking here than in any other cathedral Ave have seen. It is surely most unsatisfactory that our artists and artisans, with all the boasted pro gress of science and the industrial improvements of which we hear so much, are not able to turn out work equal to that of the monks and handicraftsmen of five hundred years a^o. For brilliancy of tints, depth of tone, harmonious grouping of figures and blending of colours, for purity of design and technical skill, for knowledge of all the resources of the art of glass"], [125, "YORK. 99 staining, the artists of the present day are not to be mentioned in the same breath or compared with those of former days. It is very remarkable and most fortunate that the stained glass in York Minster has escaped destruction at the time of the Reformation. It is said that this is because, when York surrendered to Fairfax in defaced. Another explanation, the history of the Minster and of the city, is that Fairfax, being himself a Yorkshireman (he was born at Otley, near Harrogate), and being proud of the glorious Minster of his county, made every effort to preserve it and protect it against injury at the handsof the soldiers. What ever explanation is the true one matters but little ; the important fact remains that the splendid stained glass in York Minster has been 1644, it Avas stipulated that none of the churches should be given to us by a man who seemed to be very conversant with preserved, a superb monu ment of early Art, and a subject of admiration to posterity. From the nave we pro ceeded to the transepts and the choir, after examining the central tower and lan tern, resting on four pillars of gigantic size. The south transept, which is said to be the most ancient por tion of the Minster, and A Street in the Old Quarter, York. through which access is gained to the interior of the Cathedral, has a very florid porch, recently restored and repaired by Mr. Street, who has introduced some curious pepper-boxes by way of decoration, the effect of which is ludicrous. The great weight of the tower on this part of the Minster has caused some of the south arches to shift, and from the choir one of them is clearly seen to be sinking out of its proper shape. \u2022-> o"], [126, "SKETCHES OF ENGLAND. 100 Like the outer part of the south transept, the interior has undergone repairs and alterations under the direction of Mr. Street, who has tampered Avith the wooden roof and ceiling, and improved, or rather attempted to improve, upon the original work, by causing it to be painted and gilded. The effect of this is that the roof in the south transept seems to be much lower than in the north transept, although the height in both is the same. Altogether the innovation introduced by the architect is far from felicitous, and it is said that there has been a good deal of discussion among the clergy of York on the subject of these repairs and alterations. The north transept is chiefly remarkable on account of the five windows, called the \" Five Sisters,\" which occupy practically the whole of the north end of the transept. They are filled with stained glass of various colours, forming geometrical or diapered patterns, very effective, no doubt, but inferior in beauty to the figure subjects in other windows. In the choir, again, which we next visited, there is another very splendid window, partly hidden from vieAV by the altar-screen. The most remarkable feature in this choir is its immense height and width. We were hurried through it too rapidly by the vergers, who took us down to the crypt, where we saw a number of gas and other pipes for heating purposes, contrasting vividly with Norman and Early English masonry of a very interesting character to people of an arch\u00e6ological turn of mind, but, as we have said before, the people Avho worked at these fragments of walls and their history concern us a deal more than the stones we now see encased in modern stone or brickwork, which, Avith due respect to the Roman and Early English artisans, struck us as being quite as well, if not better done. But then we are not among those who think that anything old must be admired because of its antiquity, and prefer a straight-backed wooden chair of the fifteenth century to a commodious and comfortable modern arm-chair. We have bad taste enough to prefer spring cushions and a soft seat, with an artistically curved back and arms, to an elaborately carved wooden chair, such as the coronation chair, for instance, to be seen in Westminster Abbey. As far as comfort and convenience go, we unhesitatingly proclaim the superiority of modern handiwork, and for this only reason every day congratulate ourselves that we were born in the nineteenth century. In the matter of Art, however, we have to admit that the sculptors who carved the abominations, misnamed monuments, to be seen in the Minster, are sadly inferior to their predecessors, whose work is to be seen in the capitals of the piers, in the niches of saints, and in the carvings of the portals and the fanciful ornaments of the Chapter House. It is perfectly evident to any one whose mind is not prejudiced, that if we have made immense strides in Art from a technical point of view, we are very deficient in inspiration, for the simple reason that the great incentive to real Art, faith, is wanting in modern artists. Painting and sculpture, which, like dancing and even acting, were originally hieratic arts, and then partook of a sacred character, with the result that the believers devoted themselves to them with great ardour and religious zeal, thus giving expression in their work to their feelings of reverence and faith, have now become lay arts, and are deprived to a great extent of their noblest characteristics. Modern artists have faith in their art, no doubt, but artistic faith and"], [127, "YORK 101 religious faith are two very different things. In former days Art was a means of expressing religious faith ; men devoted their lives to the planning and erection of a church, to its embellishment, adornment, and decoration. Their piety, their enthusiasm then assumed a tangible and visible form ; within certain general rules or canons, imposed upon them by the religious law, their imagination, fancy, and genius had full scope, and were unfettered by restrictions of any kind, to such an extent that satire, caricature, and even licentiousness, verging on what we should now call obscenity, were looked upon with complacency by the church dignitaries, who found nothing reprehensible in them. Men, in that time, threw their soul into their Avork, and made up in earnestness for any deficiency in technique, their very naivete in many instances giving an enhanced value to their work. Now there is no such being as a naif artist : the species is as extinct as the dodo, and if occasionally one is found who seems to be endowed with a certain amount of naivete, it may be taken for granted that his naivete is assumed. Modern artists are certainly better painters or sculptors, from a technical point of view, than those of what people call the good old times, probably because they did not live in them ; but their works do not appeal to our imagination, they appeal to our knowledge of technique, to our critical faculties ; and Avhat an extraordinary literature has sprung up in consequence ! A new language, possessed by a privileged few, and generally unintelligible to the vast majority of ordinary mortals, has been invented, a study of which will repay those who care to make their profession to speak or, better, to write it. Latin and Greek are of little value by the side of Art jargon, aDd to the initiated the latter is worth ever so many hundred pounds a year more than the former. Is not the creation of this neAV language a sure sign that Art is not what it used to be ; that it has undergone a complete transformation, and to such an extent that the language used by our forefathers has been found insufficient to express new ideas, or rather new things ? The words composing the European languages of the two or three centuries immediately preceding that in which we live were good enough to convey an adequate appreciation of all the masterpieces of ancient, medi\u00e6val, and modern Art, of the works of Phidias, of Donatello, of Raphael, of Rubens, of Van Dyck, of Michael Angelo ; but when we come to Messrs, A, B, C. X, Y, and Z, our esteemed contemporaries, a new language must needs be invented, and new words coined to express our admiration of these gentlemen's achievements. By all means let them be praised as they deserve, but they might be satisfied with the laudatory terms and language used by our ancestors to their predecessors and masters. But we have been wandering away from the Minster. Let us return thither and give a last look round. As we were on the point of leaving, we noticed in a dark corner a tomb surmounted by a marble slab supported by four pillars. Under that slab was a recumbent figure of a man which attracted our attention, although for want of light we could see it but imperfectly. On close examination this proved to be a very remarkable specimen of what would be called at the present time realistic Art. The monument, tAvo or three centuries old, was that of a clerk who died of a wasting disease, and the artist has represented him in the state of illness, emaciation, and suffering immediately preceding his death. It would be"], [128, "SKETCHES OF ENGLAND. 102 difficult to find anything more impressive than this stone effigy of a dying man. The lifeless form carved in white stone, to which time has imparted a vellum colour, not unlike that of the skin of the sick, stands out curiously on the black slab which supports it. The face is like a death's head ; the emaciated limbs, the body whose bones seem as if they were going to burst through the distended skin, are as plainly shown and as carefully and correctly represented as in an anatomical preparation for the use of medical students. In modern phraseology, this is as realistic a work as ever came out of an artist's hands. Can this piece of sculpture be honestly compared with the ridiculous modern monuments, in which soldiers in shakos and stiff trousers, and sailors in curious looking hats and jackets, are disporting themselves to the astonishment and bewilderment of visitors and strangers, not to mention artists, who probably shudder at the sight ? Is it not plain that whereas the one is a labour of love, the other is a labour of money ? Given so many gold sovereigns, hoAv many soldiers in full regimentals can profitably be introduced on a marble slab of certain size ? This problem has been solved with great satisfaction and advantage to themselves by a number of stone carvers, whose works deface the walls of Minster. After seeing these things, one fancies one can understand why the English object to the decoration of their churches ; but this is evidently not the point of view from which they consider the question, for in London, at Westminster Abbey and at St. Paul's Cathedral, they have multiplied, and are daily adding to, the number of the monuments which are so objectionable, and make the churches look like something between a museum and a stone mason's yard, such as one sees in the vicinity of Portland Road Station, in London. There are a number of churches in York besides the Minster, but by the side of the Cathedral they sink into insignificance, and are of comparatively little interest. And if one has any spare time after visiting the Minster, it had much better be employed in going over the museum in the grounds of St. Mary's Abbey, situated near Lendal Bridge. Of the old abbey, founded a feAAr years after the Conquest, very little now remains. The monastic buildings shared the fate of all edifices of the same kind, and were gradually allowed to decay. At various periods the hands of men came to the assistance of time ; permission was given to remove some of the stone to repair other buildings, and the Beverley Minster was restored with materials taken from St. Mary's Abbey, the necessary authorisation having been granted by the enlightened ministers of King George I. The ruins of the abbey church are about the most interesting remains of the monastery, together with a large hall (hospitium), which has now been converted into a museum, where antiquities, Roman, Saxon, and Anglian, are carefully preserved, well arranged, and excel lently described in a catalogue sold at the museum. These antiquities are the more interesting, on account of their having been found, for the greater part, in York, or in the immediate neighbourhood. York, or to give it its Latin name, Eboracum, was taken and occupied by the Romans (a.d. 79), who made it the head quarters of the 6th legion. It eventually became an important colony, in fact, the most important colony in Britain, and was looked upon as another Rome. Severus died at York, and it is said that Constantine the Great, the first Christian Emperor, was born in Eboracum."], [129, "YORK. 103 For several centuries the city Avas th( it of the Roman administration of North se\u00a3 Britain, and grew in importance and wealth ; its buildings, public edifices, and temples were renowned for their beauty, luxury, and statelines. many interesting relics of the period of Roman occupation, so many traces of Roman civilisation \u2022 were discovered in and about York. It is therefore not surprising that so The museum contains a large number of sepulchral monuments, coffins, and inscriptions \u2014 complete or in fragments \u2014 of great historical and artistic ATalue. Some of the mosaic pave ments are of very good workmanship, and two Roman altars, dedicated to their female deities, are particularly noticeable. However, the gem of the museum seemed to us to be the collection of Roman, Saxon, and Norman earthenware and glass, which is one of the largest and best to be found in any provincial museum. In the same gardens stands a Grecian build ing, containing the Natural History Museum and lecture room. The collections, chiefly of local interest, are arranged with great care, and comprise, beside collections of natural history, fossil and geological specimens of considerable rarity, as well as some curious examples of early English tapestry work. There is also a large and valuable collection of coins. There were very few people in the galleries when Ave went there, and we were told that the attendance is by no means large at any time. One of the most difficult problems one has to solve when in York \u2014 especially in the autumn, when the days get short and the night-shades fall early \u2014 is how to kill time in the evening. Dinner, that solemn meal served by waiters who look like vergers, is soon over. The hotel drawing-room, peopled with silent ladies A Court near the Cathedral, Yoi and speechless gentlemen, ensconced in seats scattered about the room, and reading books and newspapers, reminds one of a wax figure show badly lighted and without music, and if not a chamber of horrors, is certainly a horrible chamber, a glance at which is sufficient to drive"], [130, "SKETCHES OF ENGLAND. 104 any one away. We looked, and we ran. There was the smoking-room, a narroAV, small, ill-ventilated apartment, where the fumes of tobacco, agreeably mixed with the smell of brandy, Avhisky, gin, and other liquors, made the atmosphere quite suffocating, and in which we found it impossible to stay more than five minutes, without running the risk of being asphyxiated. Not being desirous of ending our days in Eboracum, we rushed out and into the garden ? Go into the drawing-room we could not, into the smoking-room we dare not, to bed we would not. We accordingly sought and obtained an interview with that most useful of functionaries, the hall porter, who disclosed to us the important fact that there was, at the present time, a Health Exhibition, and that the Exhibition was open at night. That was enough. A few minutes later Ave entered the Exhibition buildings at Bootham Bar, and soon found ourselves in a large hall, at the end of which was a platform, where a military band was discoursing SAveet music. We have a lively recollection of a medley of Scotch melodies, executed on the cornet by the assistant-bandmaster. The executant \u2014 we were going to say the executioner \u2014 appeared to be immensely satisfied with himself; but the Scotch airs did not seem to be much in favour with the audience, who were very chary of applause. On three sides of the building ran a gallery, to Avhich access was gained by tolerably Avide staircases. The exhibits comprised every variety of objects which can, by any possible means, be connected in any way with health, from sweetmeats to flannel vests, from drain-pipes to patent waterproof boots, from specially prepared cocoa to wall-papers. Some of the sweets and eatables, to judge by their appearance, could have but a very remote connection with health. On the contrary, one would have thought that he who was rash enough to try them Avould soon find that they were conducive to indigestion, dyspepsia, and other diseases of the digestive organs. The exhibition was also somewhat of a bazaar, for the stall-keepers, as we passed by or examined the various objects exhibited, thrust prospectuses into our hands, and invited us to make purchases. One young lady in particular was very anxious to sell to us a few yards of sanitary flannel, and another was equally desirous to part, for a consideration, with a quantity of indigestible-looking bonbons, whose hygienic properties she represented as perfectly marvellous. But we were obdurate ; nothing could induce us to make any purchases at the Health Exhibition, not even at the refreshment bars, where strange hygienic drinks were dispensed to a crowd of thirsty visitors. These refreshment bars, by the way, were the only places in the Exhibition where more than half-a-dozen people were assembled at one and the same time. After going round the Exhibition three or four times, and giving a hasty look to the paintings and drawings hung in one or two adjoining galleries, we left Bootham Bar without being much impressed with what we had seen, but we had succeeded in killing time, and we returned to our hotel through the dark and silent streets. Is it necessary to add that York being a cathedral city we found there the Salvation Armv well represented ? We have already noted the fact at Canterbury and at Chester. York is no exception to the rule. The warriors commanded by General Booth hold the town under the indifferent eye of the regular clergy. This is a very striking fact, and one that requires"], [131, "YORK 105 an explanation Avhich we have not been able to obtain from any one we have questioned on the subject. The surprising development and extension of the salvation craze is certainly one of the things that forcibly strike foreigners travelling in England. Another curious fact in connection with this institution is the reticent manner in which English people speak of it, especially people belonging to the middle classes. The higher classes do not hesitate to express freely their contempt for it ; but with that exception almost any one else to whom the subject is mentioned runs off at a tangent, replies in an evasive manner, at the same time pointing out the success of General Booth's undertaking, the facility with Avhich he gets money, and the steadily increasing number of its adherents. Now, these adherents are almost exclusively draAvn from the popular and loAver middle classes, and it is a remarkable fact that if you enter one of the places of worship belonging to the Established Church of England you will find very few working men in it. Does not this show that the Church of England is gradually losing its hold upon the masses, with which it has very little in common, and that it is becoming more and more the church of the well-to-do and of the aristocratic classes ? We have been told again and again that the English clergy are drawn exclusively from the upper classes, and that no clergyman of the Church of England belongs to the lower classes by birth. Perhaps we must look in that direction for an explanation of the success of the Salvation Army, a deplorable and degrading fact, whatever the cause of it may be. p"], [132, "CHAPTER VIII. LEEDS. T sometimes happens that people Avho to every appearance are in the full enjoyment of their mental faculties, who could not by any means be called insane, and Wflfea*\u00a9* who would be refused admittance in any well-regulated mad-house, do unac countable things. Now, there is no record of any one, either in the artist's or the scribe's family, ever having had to wear that most uncomfortable garment, a strait jacket, or to be placed under restraint in a padded room, under the close supervision of a keeper or two and the care of a mad doctor. Yet both the artist and the scribe, under the influence of some nightmare, or, it may be suggested, suffering from some sudden mental derangement, one fine morning made up their minds to go to Leeds. Why of all places in the world we should have selected Leeds as the next stage in our peregrinations through various parts of the United Kingdom, Ave are absolutely unable to tell and utterly at a loss to understand. That we have been there, there is no shadoAV of a doubt, but the motives of that rash act of ours will never be known. Our grandchildren, if we have any, will wonder what took us there, and it will be recorded in the annals of our respective families that we went to Leeds in the year of grace 1886, but that why we went there, under what influence, and for what object, has ever remained an inscrutable mystery. The English have a saying to the effect that a certain king of France, with three thousand men, marched up a hill and then marched down again. As it is precisely what all people do who ever go up a hill, there was perhaps no necessity for recording the fact in the immortal wrords quoted above, and if we allude to them it is simply to say, that having gone to Leeds Ave came out of it again as soon as we possibly and conveniently could. After York, where there are so many recollections of the invasion of Great Britain by the conquering legions of old Rome, it was gratifying, but not surprising, to be assured that Leeds has not a Roman origin. This, be it said in passing, is the one redeeming feature of Leeds. But if the ubiquitous Roman was not at Leeds he was in the neighbourhood, where it is said there are traces of a large Roman town, and it is even believed that the Romans worked and smelted the iron which is so abundant in the district. If this be true, it would tend to show that the immense resources of Britain were fully known to the conquerors and turned by them to excellent account, and that, after all, the English have had but to follow in their footsteps ; thus being simply imitators and owing their prosperity and riches not to their own initiative, but to the superior knowledge and industry of the Romans."], [133, "LEEDS. 107 Leeds appears to have been, at a -subsequent period, the capital of a small independent kingdom called Loidis, and after the Conquest it shared the vicissitudes of that region of Britain called Yorkshire. Leeds is the ugliest, darkest, and most dismal toAvn it is possible to imagine. It is nothing but a large agglomeration of mills, factories, and Avorkshops, Avhere they manufacture almost everything, and of warehouses innumerable, where all these things are sold. By the side of Leeds Liverpool can be called beautiful, and that is saying a good deal. Its 300,000 inhabitants are almost wholly engaged in trade, commerce, and in the numerous industries to which the town owes its prosperity. Although Leeds is the centre of the cloth trade of England, as it is the commercial and industrial capital of Yorkshire, there is hardly any kind of manufacture which is not represented in this busy but unlovely and unloveable place. Whoever is not particularly interested in the woollen cloth trade has no business there. A gentleman to whom Ave were recommended was kind enough to give us a mass of Arery useful information as to the difference between woollen goods and worsted goods ; but Ave confess that we have had the greatest difficulty in following him, and we are perfectly unable to distinguish woollen from worsted and worsted from woollen. Both are made of wool, and that is all we are able to say ; as to the mysteries of short wool and long wool, we could not fathom them, and are now as ignorant as we were before going to Leeds. As a matter of course we pretended to be deeply interested in the history of wool and worsted, and when we were told that wool was exported from Great Britain during the Roman period, we expressed our gratification in the most enthusiastic terms at our command. We learned with becoming interest that colonies of Flemings settled in Yorkshire, and brought with them industry and wealth to their adopted country. It was through these men that the cloth trade of England acquired its extension and renown. And as we inquired why Yorkshire had become the almost exclusive centre of this manufacture, we Avere informed that it was owing to the natural advantages which it enjoyed to a greater degree than any other district in Great Britain, these being water, coal, and iron, which are so abundant in Yorkshire. What surprised us most was to be told that Leeds, where there are now about one thousand mills, factories, and manufacturing establishments of all kinds, had but one factory at the end of the last century, and that the population of the town in 1801 was only about 50,000. There are now at Leeds some 300,000 inhabitants, so that this marvellous increase in the population and production has been the work of the last eighty years or so. Except in America, there is probably no country in the world where towns and cities rise so quickly into importance under the influence of trade and commerce, and give so remarkable an example of what can be accomplished by energy and private initiative. It is commonly believed that when you have visited a particular town or locality, you know more about it than those who have never been near it. And generally speaking this is perfectly true, but there are exceptions to every rule, and Leeds is one of them. Now we are fully conscious that if instead of going to Leeds we had quietly remained at home, or at some pleasant country town or watering-place, and read the history of the p 2"], [134, "108 SKETCHES OF ENGLAND. commercial capital of Yorkshire and of, its numerous industries with a moderate amount of attention and note-taking, we should know, or at all events appear to know, a great deal more about it than we do. We should have no end of interesting tales to tell about the natural productions of the county, its resources and manufactures, the iron and coal mines, not forgetting the lead mines, Avhich Avere \" certainly worked by the Romans.\" For nothing looks so well as an occasional mention of the Romans, or the Saxons, or the Danes : it shows historical knoAvledge, if a lack of originality. The Saxons and the Danes are good enough in their Avay, but if you want to make an impression and display a large amount of erudition, there is nothing like the Romans. \u00bb > Had we, then, read the numerous and ponderous volumes written on the \" Metallurgy of Iron,\" or the \"History of the Worsted Manufacture,\" perused all the works on Yorkshire, and Leeds, and the British industries, we should now be able to enumerate and describe the tAventy-six processes to be undergone by the wool from the moment it conies out of the Australian bale to that Avhen, in the shape of cloth, it is sent in cases to the various markets of the world. We might also describe the spinning and the weaving mills, the fairy-like Avork of the spinning mule or jenny, the scouring and dyeing processes, exactly as if we had seen the Avhole of the series of operations and understood all about them. We shall do nothing of the kind, for the Arery good reason that we are not giving other people's impressions, but our own. We have not been inside any one of the thousand mills situated in and about Leeds, and therefore cannot describe Avhat we have not seen. Manufacturers are not particularly anxious to see visitors in their factories under any circumstances whatever, and if the visitors happen, as in our case, to be foreigners armed with portfolio aud note-book, they stand every possible chance of being refused admittance to the huge square buildings where they manufacture the various materials which our tailors buy so cheap and sell so dear, when turned into coats, jackets, and \u2014 those twin flexible tubes in which we encase our nether limbs in this century of ours. Wandering in and about Leeds is one of the most ungrateful tasks it has ever been our lot to accomplish. Under the dark sky, in the murky atmosphere and the prevailing mist, the pretentious Italian, Palladian, and so-called Renaissance buildings, reared at great expense, have an unpleasant appearance ; by their inappropriateness to the climate, they seem to make Leeds a more depressing place than it reasonably ought to be. And in this respect Nature has done so much for Leeds that there was no necessity for Art to step in and make it more depressing still. One feature of the town, howeA-er, deserves a special mention, and that is the vast number of educational establishments, mechanics' institutes, and libraries with Avhich the public-spirited citizens of Leeds have provided their city, and which are of great benefit to the working classes and the inhabitants in general. All these institutions and libraries have been founded by private individuals, and they are, for the most part, kept by voluntary contributions, subscriptions, or legacies, the State not contributing a penny to their support. Private initiative and benevolence are truly unbounded in England, but it must also be said that there is no country in the world where such large fortunes are made, and wealth is"], [135, "LEEDS. 109 limited to such a comparatively small number of men. Under such circumstances benevo lence and liberality seem to become more an obligation than a virtue. On Sundays Leeds is dismal, and no description of it can give an accurate idea of the aspect of the town on the day of rest. During our trip in England we wrere told that on a certain occasion that most amusing of English comic papers, Punch, Avhich is an excellent typical representative of British ideas and idiosyncrasies, more particularly when it takes upon itself, more Britannico, to lecture everybody on every possible subject, gave to people about to marry that cynical advice, \"Don't.\" Without stopping to enquire whether, on that occasion, \"Mr. Punch,\" as the English like to call him, Avas not guilty of great impropriety, and simply referring him to the speech of Gorgibus to his daughter and niece, in Les Precieuses ridicules, we may appropriate his advice, and emphatically say to those who are not bound under the most fearful penalties to go to Leeds, and might feel disposed to go there, \"-Don't ! \""], [136, "CHAPTER IX. LIVERPOOL. !^f|T?^ NGLISH railways are generally so admirably managed that we were greatly sur ly pV^ prised to travel in the dark from Buncorn to Liverpool, owing to the absence mr^&Sb of lamps in the carriages. The distance is not great, but it is very unpleasant to be locked in a railway compartment, even for a short time, with unknown travelling companions whom you cannot see. Night was falling fast when we crossed the Mersey over the Buncorn viaduct, but fortu nately we were able to catch a glimpse of this remai'kable engineering work, as after crossing it the line describes a sharp curve and runs parallel to the river. Let the traveller who goes to Liverpool first enquire Avhether any of the crack Atlantic liners is about to sail for America within a day or two of his arrival, or he may run the risk of being unable to find a room in the best hotels, and having to put up at some third-rate inn. This last redoubtable alternative Ave narrowly escaped, and we hope that our experience may be useful to intending visitors to the great city on the Mersey. On arriving at Lime Street, we confidently engaged a porter to carry our luggage to the Station Hotel, when the usual young lady who officiates as a clerk in this establishment, in a very off-hand way replied to our question by another inquiry, and finding we had not bespoken rooms by telegraph, informed us that Ave could not be accommodated. We timidly asked where we might expect to find a shelter for the night, but the young Liverpudlian expressed her absolute inability to give us any information on the subject, and left us tete-a tete with our porter, who said that, \" It's always the same on the eve of the sailing of the steamers.\" There remained nothing else to do but to charter a cab and drive from hotel to hotel, until at last the Royal Hotel opened to us its hospitable doors, and we had the satisfaction of having secured a night's lodging. It goes without saying that the first thing we did the next morning was to make for the Mersey. For what is there a foreigner cares for in Liverpool except the wide river the Atlantic liners, the ships of all kinds coming from or bound for all quarters of the globe ? To the Mersey accordingly we went, through Panel agh Street, Church Street, aud the celebrated Lord Street. In Lime Street what particularly struck us was the immense number of tram-cars following close upon each other which are to be met with. The tram-car appears to be the favourite mode of locomotion of the Liverpudlians, who avail themselves of it to an extraordinary extent. As a natural consequence of the inhabitants' preference for these"], [137, ""], [138, ""], [139, "L0ADIXG A'ESSELS, LIA'ERPOOL"], [140, ""], [141, "LIVERPOOL. 111 convenient vehicles \u2014 which, by the way, were first introduced in England at Birkenhead, on the other side of the Mersey \u2014 there are now very few omnibuses in Liverpool, and the cabs \u2014 not particularly good ones, either \u2014 are not in great demand. On our first expedition through the crowded thoroughfares of Liverpool, we walked, preferring to mix with the people, and at the same time to be able to branch off from the main into any by-streets likely to attract our attention. The streets are wide, bordered by lofty and substantial buildings occupied by offices and warehouses. The shops in the best streets are very good, and equal in many respects to those in London, but the display of goods in the windows is more plentiful than tasteful. It is not an easy thing to look at shop wdndows in Liverpool, as people pass along and brush and rub against you in a fashion which testifies more to their busy life than to their urbanity or courtesy. They rush along at a mad pace, push you aside without the least compunction if you are at all in their way, and appear to be racing with each other. So great is the passenger traffic that at every other lamp post there is a board with the words \"Keep to the right\" painted upon it, a warning to foot passen- In the Docks, Liverpool, gers that they must walk, as the carriages drivers are to keep to their left, whilst the in the roadway run, in double files. Only the foot passengers are to keep to their right. The general aspect of the streets reminds one of the City of London. Of dwelling-houses there are none in that part of the town, in which no one seems to live except the strangers and visitors who lodge in the hotels. The crowd also is very much like that of London in costume and general appearance, the only difference being a larger number of seafaring men easily distinguishable from landsmen, and of foreigners belonging to the most varied nationalities, as evidenced by the equally varied hues of their skin and complexion. Going round by way of a side street, we soon found ourselves in front of a very ugly-"], [142, "112 SKETCHES OF ENGLAND. looking building, surmounted by a dome having the shape of a half-inflated balloon, which turned out to be the Custom House. In front of the building Avas a large open space, beyond AA'hich we could see, rising above the roofs of huge sheds or warehouses, the masts of numberless ships. We were at last close to the docks and the Mersey, but both the river and the docks were hidden from view, and we had to go round through the Avarehouses before we could see the river. A long and wide street separates the docks from the town ; at this particular spot it is called Wapping, but it extends northwards to a distance of several miles under various names, although practically it is the same thoroughfare. Lines of rails are laid along the whole length of the street, and are used to connect the docks with the numerous lines of railway converging to Liverpool ; the omnibuses, which run from one end of the line of docks to the other, are so constructed that their Avheels fit exactly in the rails, but every now and then, the line being blocked by heavy trains or carts, the driver runs off the metals, and the sensation experienced by the passengers Avhilst the omnibus runs over the rough paving-stones is simply excruciating. As in all busy places, there are a number of idlers at Liverpool. Crowds of men were leaning against the railings of the dock gates having apparently nothing to do, and looking very much as if they wished to remain in that blissful state of idleness. Their hands in their pockets, there they stood, smoking, laughing and talking, evidently pleased with their lot and taking things easy. Their indolence was the more striking as it contrasted with the animation prevailing all around. A double stream of carts, waggons, railway trucks, cabs, omnibuses, wheelbarrows, and every kind of contrivance going on one, two, or four wheels were passing in the road, making a deafening noise as they rattled over the stones. Within the sheds, which eArery one seems to be at liberty to enter, a number of men were loading carts or unloading ships, and in nearly every one was a forge, where the noise of the hammer striking the anvil and that of the puffing and snorting of the steam cranes were heard, but not the voice of men, as the English have a silent way of going to work which is most remarkable. The only exception to that general rule are the sailors, whose man\u0153uvres are accompanied by a sort of monotonous nasal chant, the effect of which, to any one not to the manner born, is anything but inspiriting. It is, however, said that it materially assists them in the discharge of their arduous duties. The most animated place in Liverpool is the large floating pontoon, called Prince's Land ing Stage, where ferries embark and disembark passengers from morning till night, going incessantly backwards and forwards from the east to the west shore, loaded with passengers or with carts, horses, carriages, or cattle. These ferry-boats are wide and can accommodate a large number of people. They appear to be nearly always full, whatever their destination may be, the inference being, obviously, that the people who live on the Cheshire coast have a large amount of business to transact on the opposite side, whilst* the denizens of the Lancashire coast are equally anxious to get to the west shore in order to attend to their duties and occupations."], [143, "LIVERPOOL. 113 A number of large steamers go up and down the river, small sailing boats and steam launches scud along rapidly, and the ferry-boats pick their way among the craft of all sorts crowding in the Mersey, as full of boats and ships of every description as a London street of vehicles of all kinds. On the stage itself, people hurry on board the ferries or on land, whilst sight-seers leaning against the iron posts and chains look at the wonderfully animated scene before them. Beyond stands Birkenhead, the suburb of Liverpool, of which it is a copy on a reduced scale. It takes about ten minutes to cross from one side to the other, and it is said that in bad weather the Mersey is sufficiently rough for the crossing to be a matter of some incon- A-enience to people who are liable to sea-sickness. As to that we cannot speak from experience. The weather was dull, but the Mersey was calm, and we were landed safely at Birkenhead. There we saAV docks, warehouses and banks, factories, and rows of industrial cottages in habited by the working classes, the whole being under a pall of smoke. There is a park at Birkenhead, of which we could only catch a glimpse, as we were in a hurry to get back to Liverpool, by wray of the Tunnel, which had been recently opened. The tunnel railway station is near the Woodside pier. A short walk brought us there, not, however, without some difficulty, as the natives, whether from ignorance or for the sake of a little enjoyment at the expense of strangers, especially when the strangers happen, as in our case, to be foreigners, generally manage to give Avrong information. This we found to be the case both at Liverpool and Birkenhead. Being fond of a joke ourselves, Ave rather appreciated the peculiar idiosyncrasy of the Liverpudlians and of the Birkenheadites, at the same time checking every direction given us by referring to our trusty guides, philosophers, and friends, the red book and the green book, and in particular to the maps and plans they contained. We thus managed not to walk uselessly more than three or four miles a day, which is, all things considered, a very reasonable average. The tunnel, on the Birkenhead side of the Mersey, is at a much greater depth from the surface of the roadway than on the Lancashire side, and there are two ways of reaching the platform, the staircase and the lift. With our usual hatred of unnecessary exertion, espe cially in hot and sultry weather, we selected the last-mentioned mode of getting to the train, and we had every reason to congratulate ourselves on our choice, as even by the lift it takes two or three minutes to get to the bottom of the shaft. There are two lifts \u2014 one for first and second-class, and one for third-class passengers. They are roomy, upholstered in the same style as railway carriages, and well lighted. When the lift stopped the guard opened the door, and we found the train in readiness. It was a matter of considerable surprise to us to hear that although the tunnel had been used for some months, no through trains had been arranged so as to enable travellers from Wales and the south-western districts of England to come to Liverpool without going round by way of Runcorn. It appears that the railway companies have some difficulty in coming to terms, and the result was, when we were at Liverpool (and possibly is now), that except Q"], [144, "SKETCHES OF ENGLAND. 114 in so far as the Liverpudlians and Birkenhead people themselves are concerned, the Mersey tunnel is practically useless for commercial purposes and goods and passenger traffic other than those local. Time is money, people say in England, and it seems as if they had been losing time considerably over the tunnel business. The temperature in the tunnel is quite tolerable, and the atmosphere sufficiently pure. The time actually occupied in the journey from one station to the other is about five minutes, so that with the time for going down to the train and coming up again, the journey by train is quite as long as that by boat. But the train has the great advantage of not exposing the passengers to the rain in wet weather, or to sea-sickness Avhen it is rough on the Mersey, as it often is, if we are correctly informed. A flight of steps and a long inclined way lead from the arrival platform in Liverpool to the level of the roadway, and we soon emerged from the bowels of the earth into Water Street, where we resumed our promenade along the line of docks. The street parallel to the Mersey, from which it is separated by the dock warehouses and basins, was as busy and animated as in the early morning, if not more so. There are a large number of policemen in and about the docks, besides numerous keepers, a by no means unnecessary precaution, considering the population of this part of the toAvn. It Avould be difficult to find more misery, degradation, vice, and crime than in the by-streets branching off from this road. In these dirty narroAV lanes, on each side of Avhich are long rows of dens or hovels inhabited by beings whom Ave must call human for want of a better word, but Avhose faces denote the most bestial instincts and criminal habits, it is hardly safe to venture in daytime, and tantamount to suicide to pass at night. A policeman to whom we were speaking was kind enough to inform us that these men (meaning the roughs who were slovenly Avalking up and down the road), would willingly cut our throats for sixpence, upon Avhich we quietly, but resolutely, made up our minds not to give them the opportunity of trying their hand on us, and as discretion is often the better part of valour, we studiously avoided the streets adjoining the docks in our night rambles. At twelve o'clock work is suspended in the docks, and the men have their dinners either in the numerous public and eating-houses to be found in the neighbourhood, or in the street at the gate of the docks, where their food is brought to them by their wives or children. There they sit on a stone or a log, or more commonly still, on the pavement, eating a modest but substantial repast, whilst the wife, standing near, ministers to the wants of her lord and master. These women, it must be admitted, look very untidy, with their tattered garments which they never seem to have cleaned or mended from the day they first put them on. They, nearly all, have no head covering, and wear their hair generally tied in a knot at the back of the head, or falling on their shoulders, which are wrapped in a shawl whose original colour it would be impossible to determine ; about half of them have no shoes or stockings on their feet. In Liverpool, as in all large English towns, nothing is more striking in the general appearance of the working aud poorer classes than the uncertain colour and doubtful cleanli ness of their garments, which are as little appropriate to their calling as possible. Instead of"], [145, "AN OTEX AIR MARKET, LIVERPOOL"], [146, ""], [147, "LIVERPOOL. 115 wearing over their woollen clothes some washing material, they persist in working in these clothes, the colour of which entirely disappears under successive layers of dirt, dust, and grease, to which every day adds a fresh instalment. It is to this habit that an English crowd of working men owes its peculiar dust colour and unpleasant appearance. The British workman would think it a disgrace to go about with a clean blue or white blouse over his cloth jacket. He prefers to sport that jacket, however filthy it may be, rather than wear a distinctive costume which might denote his social position. He fancies, no doubt, that by wearing a costume as similar as possible to that of his master, he places himself one rung higher on the social ladder. He completely forgets the layer of dirt on his coat and, ostrich like, fondly believes that no one notices it. This is a very curious and remarkable trait in the working classes ; it has over and over again been commented upon, but it is ever striking and incomprehensible to us foreigners who are accustomed to see our working men wearing blouses. The misery and poverty are more conspicuous and general in Liverpool than in any place we know of. The number of men, women, and children in rags, with bare feet and heads, and covered with filth and vermin, is truly appalling. They go in small groups and knots, gaunt and hungry, casting greedy looks at the windows of the eating-houses where huge pieces of meat and extraordinary compounds of suet and flour, studded with black things said to be raisins, are simmering over low gas stoA'es, in an ocean of greasy fluid of a bro*wnish hue of the most dreadful appearance. A number of what we took for yellow straw mats are piled up against the window-glass, and on closer examination prove to be fried fish. Behind the counter where the unappetising viands of which we have just spoken are simmering, tAvo or three men and women in dirty aprons, their sleeves tucked up above the elbow, are dispensing their wares to a crowd of customers. Among the patrons of these establishments the feminine element seems to predominate and to be more difficult to please than the masculine element, if the complaints of the female customers, to be heard from the outside, and their expostulatory gestures are to be taken as an indication of their feelings. The poor wretches in tatters stop in front of these shops, men, women, and children throw a\\dd glances on the contents of the dishes, and move on. A few steps farther, a man, sleek and fat, from a little stall offers them some religious tracts or a Bible, for there is probably no place in the world where so many Bibles, in so many languages, are distributed or sold by the Biblical Societies so numerous in England. It is very proper, no doubt, that it should be so, but what cold comfort a tract or even a Bible is to the poor people whose stomachs are empty ! Might not some of the money spent in printing and distributing tracts, some of which are a libel on common sense and deoency, be more usefully applied to relieve some of the misery prevalent in Liverpool ? What is the use of thrusting into the hands of poor hungry creatures a blue or red paper, with the heading, \" Where are you going ? \" Where, indeed ! To some door-step or to a corner in the docks, there to lie down, and starve, and die, in the midst of those ware houses where are stored the elements of untold wealth. Untold wealth is the only expression that can convey an adequate idea of the riches of Q 2"], [148, "116 SKETCHES OF ENGLAND. this large prosperous city, with its merchant princes, its thousands of ships, its miles of docks, and its busy population. To parody a celebrated saying, if Liverpool did not exist it would have to be invented. One cannot fancy England, Europe even, without Liverpool, which is to the old world like the antechamber of the new world, and vice versa. What a remarkable sight are these docks, extending over seven or eight miles in length, where the largest and best ships in the world bring from the remotest corners of the globe the produce of all the lands, and the industrial productions of every nation, and from whence they carry to every country the most valuable things which European Art, Science, and Commerce have combined to bring forth ! Like to some gigantic suction pump, Liverpool draAVS through its numerous channels the most varied materials, produce, and wares, which it re-distributes to the whole world by the same agencies. It is like the heart of the commercial world, each beating of which draws and causes to circulate in the trade arteries of the universe that which is essential to its life, that without which it would soon cease to exist. Such appear to us to be the functions of Liverpool in the great commercial organism of the modern world. Liverpool, however, has not ahvays been engaged in such harmless occupation, and its commercial record is far from spotless. If we turn to its arms, which are conspicuous enough in various parts of the town, we see that one of the supporters is a negro with a fish's tail, like a siren's, and this negro involuntarily reminds us of the slave trade which was the foundation of the prosperity and Avealth of this city. Under this negro supporter, the motto : \" Deus nobis h\u00e6c otia fecit,\" appears somewhat a grim joke. With these and other sundry remarks we went from dock to dock, from shed to shed, from warehouse to warehouse, passing in review the most heterogeneous articles, and noting the most varied modes of packing which human ingenuity has contrived. Equally varied and different were the ships. Here was a big East Indiaman, painted white, just arrived from Rangoon ; there one of the best known Atlantic liners, the Britannic, of the White Star Line, at present undergoing repairs after a more than usually rough passage. Every- Avhere the same silent animation so remarkable, save during the dinner hour, when every thing, engines, cranes, and all, was brought to a stand-still. As Ave returned to the centre of the town in the omnibus of which we have spoken, we were followed for a considerable distance by three ragged urchins, with very scanty clothing and painted faces. Two of them were besmeared with soot, and the third with indigo. They were turning somersaults in the road, and begging for coppers. This, we were told is a regular trade, the children being sent out by their parents, who are worse than the urchins themselves. How such a thing is permitted is difficult to understand. According to English law, education is compulsory ; how is it then that the inspectors, who, as we read in the local papers, the same day, are so . strict in the prosecution of poor women who do not send their little ones to school because they want them to do some work at home take no notice of the ragged boys with painted faces ? Are there no institutions in England for destitute children, no reformatories, no industrial schools, no police ? How can we wonder at the poverty, misery, and degradation of large English towns where such things are"], [149, "LIVERPOOL. 117 possible ? Hoav can we wonder at the immense number of roughs and criminals, whose presence in and about the docks is a real and constant danger to the population ? What will these children become but roughs and gaol-birds when they get to manhood ? At night Liverpool assumes an equally remarkable but different aspect. In and about Lime Street and the adjoining thoroughfares a brutal crowd assembles, composed of men and women of the lowest and most disreputable classes. It Avould be difficult to find in any Street Arass. civilised country a more bestial set of human beings, among whom one feels as unsafe as in the midst of a wild African tribe. Drunkenness, debauchery, unruliness, are rampant ; the public-houses and taverns, the theatres and music-halls, whose lamps and lime light throw a lurid glare in the misty atmosphere peculiar to Liverpool, are full, and when the perform ances are over and the taverns closed, this mixed population wanders in the streets. The scene then becomes perfectly hideous; men and women half dressed, quarrel and fight,"], [150, "118 SKETCHES OF ENGLAND. exchanging blows and curses, and making the streets impassable and dangerous. Horrid females with their clothes ill adjusted, accost passengers under the pretence of selling flowers, matches, or what not, Avhilst their male companions prowl about in force, ready to pounce on the unwary stranger who might be induced to say a word to these harpies of the pavement, who are wont to exclaim that they have been insulted when they do not get a few pence from those they are soliciting. At the street corners, vendors of fried or boiled potatoes, prepare and cook them in a movable kitchen on wheels drawn by a horse. These itinerant potato sellers are a curious feature of Liverpool. On Saturday nights some of the streets are converted into open-air markets, whither the populace repair for their Sunday supply of food. In the darkness of the night the unprotected petroleum or gas flames oscillate under the breath of the wind. At a distance this lurid glare has the appearance of a fire. Barrows, stalls, and shops are filled with eatables of all descriptions. Shopkeepers and costermongers vie with each other in their loud appeals to the passers-by. The butchers, fishmongers and poulterers are remarkable for the extraordinary power of their lungs, amd the display of their merchandise : huge carcases of beef and sheep, fish of every conceivable kind and degree of freshness, or the reverse; numberless geese, fowls, turkeys, and smaller birds, and enormous quantities of skinned rabbits are piled up in what they probably suppose to be a tempting array. This tempting array is very unappetising, and the sight of these eatables is anything but agreeable. We watched for some time before a butcher's shop an old lady with naked feet and unkempt hair, clad in rags, covered with the dirt and filth of several generations, taking up pieces of meat exposed for sale with her unwashed hands, which she examined more closely than was pleasant, put down, took up again, and finally made up her mind not to buy. This popular scene so disgusted us that we could not touch meat for some days. And when we thought that possibly some poor people had actually eaten the very piece of meat pawed by this old hag, our feelings may be more easily understood than described. The English custom of closing all the shops on Sundays compels the whole of the popu lation, rich or poor, to provide on Saturday for two days. The result is that on that day, and particularly at night, the popular markets are full of customers ; for the working-classes have to provide, not for two days only, but practically for the week, as the men have received their wages and handed them to their wives. The consequence is a rush on provision shops of all kinds. One would almost think that the place is on the eve of being besieged, and that the inhabitants are laying in a stock of victuals for the duration of the expected siege. This animation is confined to the populous districts aud the neighbourhood of Lime Street, where most of the places of amusement are to be found. On the contrary, the business quarters, in the vicinity of the Exchange, and Dale, Victoria, and Lord Streets, are well-nigh deserted. The houses are closed, not a sound is heard ; no one passes in these thoroughfares save here and there a solitary policeman, whe looks suspiciously on those who venture in them ; occasionally a heavy laden tramway-car appears at the crossing of the roads, its lamps throw ing a beam of light in the darkness, and quickly disappears, the sound of the horses' hoofs on the rough stones soon dying away. And all relapses into silence again."], [151, "LIVERPOOL. 119 Despite the warnings given to us, and our resolve above recorded, we found our Avay to the riverside and the Prince's landing stage, being curious to see the Mersey and the docks at night. The large open space in front of St. Nicholas' Church Avas entirely deserted, not a mouse, still less a man or woman, stirred ; the night Avas dark, the sky overcast, and heavy clouds were lowering above ; altogether the scene was somewhat dismal. The Avide bridge connecting the stage with the road Avas dimly lighted, and here we met tAvo or three belated individuals going to or coming from the ferry-boats. These, as they passed, looked at us in a suspicious manner ; but we were equal to the occasion, and returned the compliment. By their side glances we could see that they took us for night prowlers of the worst type, and it was evident that walking at night in the vicinity of Liverpool Docks is considered by the A Dockyard Shed. natives as a somewhat dangerous and bold thing to do. On the landing-stage the gas lamps made darkness visible ; a feAv passengers, in small knots or groups, Avere waiting for the ferries which could be seen on the river, their peculiar build giving them the appearance of some huge marine monsters with red eyes. Up and down the Mersey numberless vessels were at anchor, whose lights were like so many gigantic glow-worms ; under the cloudy sky the river rolled its waves, and beyond, on the Cheshire coast, the lights of Birkenhead shone in the distance. Farther north a small luminous spot indicated the existence of other villages, Seacombe, Egremont, Liscard, NeAV Brighton. All was silent, and yet there was every sign that the animation we had Avitnessed during the day was latent and ready to manifest itself again at any moment. Within a few hours these deserted streets would be alive with traffic, the river would be covered with"], [152, "120 SKETCHES OF ENGLAND. t* steamers, sailing vessels, and boats of every description ; steam would circulate through endless iron veins like blood in the arteries of human bodies, aud, like blood, would give life and energy to the steel arms of thousands of ingenious machines performing the Avork of a whole army of men. Whilst we Avere thus looking on the now silent scene, the last boat had crossed the Mersey, the last passengers had disappeared in the darkness of the deserted streets, and all was still. The monuments of Liverpool did not appear to us as either very striking or very beau tiful. The principal building is the St. George's Hall, a sort of Greek temple of the Corinthian order, standing in the midst of a large open space or square, facing Lime Street Station. Iiike all buildings of the same kind, it is strangely out of place in a northern city and under a rainy sky. In this square, and in close proximity to St. George's Hall, are various public buildings, such as a library, which is open to all, a rather unusual thing in England, where public institutions are, as a rule, open only to a comparatively limited few, and an Art gallery con taining very interesting specimens of modern British Art. Between these tAvo edifices stands a circular reading-room, built on the same plan as that of the British Museum in London. Another building of perhaps greater interest is the Exchange, adjoining the Town Hall, Avhere in the middle of the day the merchants of Liverpool meet and transact business in the open air. It is a curious sight to witness. Some hundreds of business men and their clerks talk, jot doAvn a few words in their note-books, rush towards some person they want to see, take a few notes again, and then resume talking and note-taking, and rushing and button holing, with incessant activity and unflagged energy. This pantomime, for it is nothing else to the onlooker, is one of the most amusing things to be seen in Liverpool. The reader may think that there is nothing very entertaining in a scene like this, but it should be remembered that amusing scenes in Liverpool are not precisely numerous. A drowning man, they say, clutches at a straw : upon the same principle anything out of the customary humdrum life of the great city on the Mersey makes an agreeable diversion. It seemed to us, as we wandered along the streets, that the people of Liverpool live any where except in their city, which is composed chiefly of counting-houses, offices, warehouses and docks, and of comparatively few dwelling-houses, except in that part of the town adjoining the Prince's Park, which can hardly be called Liverpool. Of course we speak of the well-to-do and wealthy people, not of the poorer population, who live in the dens situated in the vicinity of the docks. It must be admitted that in this the Liverpudlians are wise, for their city wealthy, animated, and wonderful as it is from an industrial and commercial standpoint is but a dismal place to live in, considering its damp, misty climate, and the incessant showers of rain with which it is constantly visited. It is impossible to see LiA-erpool, its docks, its warehouses, its manufactories, and its commercial and industrial establishments of all kinds, without being struck almost over powered, by the commercial genius of the English, their perseverance and enterprise which have enabled them to overcome all obstacles, and to establish on their commercial success the basis of their mighty empire. No doubt can be entertained, after a visit to this great city on"], [153, "LIVERPOOL. 121 the Mersey, of the greatness of England, of its wealth, of its poAver ; but neither can it be overlooked that its prodigious riches are only equalled by the poverty, misery, and degradation of a large number of its population, and that the latter must, in a great measure, be considered as the result and natural consequence of the former. And it may be questioned AAdiether such unexampled prosperity, balanced on the other hand by such unparalleled distress, is not bought at too great a price. Money making is a very good thing in itself, but if it is to be the only aim \u2014 as it appears to be in Liverpool \u2014 of an entire city, whose population forms no inconsiderable percentage of the whole country, then it seems to us that under such circum stances life is hardly Avorth living, at least at Liverpool. R"], [154, "CHAPTER X. CHESTER. T was pitch dark when the train steamed into the large and fine station at Chester, Avhich a number of trains were entering and leaving, Avhilst tlie platforms Avere t-V-fea^\u00a9*** filled Avith people rushing backAvards and forwards from one end to the other, the whole presenting a busy scene of considerable interest. The noise of men's voices, of guards' whistles, and of hissing steam echoed and re-echoed under the vast glass roof Avas perfectly deafening. We looked on for a short time until we could get a gentleman in a red vest and a gold-laced cap, assisted by a less gorgeous individual, to take charge of ourselves and our luggage and escort us through a maze of corridors and tunnels from the station to the hotel opposite, where we had decided to stop. This was the Queen Hotel, Avhere we were received with the decorous gravity usually displayed by the employes of such establishments in England. In due course, after the preliminary and customary parleying with a stylishly dressed young lady through an opening in a glass partition, we were conducted by a solemn man in a dress-coat to the first floor, where we were by him transferred to the care of a neat chambermaid, who ushered us into our respective apartments. Having closed our door we noticed a white plaque on Avhich the following advice was tendered to travellers, \"Bolt and lock the door.\" This advice, Avhich we had not seen for a few days, was an unmistakable sign that we were again in the midst of the civilised, busy, and commercial world. Chester is a very old city, and as its name implies, has a Roman origin. This original, historical, and profoundly learned remark being, we are informed, compulsory whenever one is writing about the old city on the Dee, Ave do not hesitate to indulge in a little cheap etymological and arch\u00e6ological digression. A statistical friend has computed the number of notices on Chester beginning with the above Avords or their equivalent, and although we cannot, at the present moment, give the exact result of his elaborate, careful and laborious calculations, Ave have a very clear and distinct recollection that it amounted to five figures. Chester has had many aliases: it was called by the Romans Deva and Devana Castra, or Castrum Legionis, and finally Cestria ; by the old Britons Caer Leon. Fawr-ar- Uufrdwy, Avhich means, so we are told, the camp of the great legion on the Dee, and by the modern Britons Chester. That Chester Avas originally a Roman camp there can be no reasonable doubt, and it is pointed out by antiquarians that its four streets radiating at right"], [155, "CHESTER. 123 angles from a common centre, which was the usual arrangement of Roman camps and towns, prove conclusively that such was the case. We have not the slightest objection to offer, and Ave will even go so far as to admit, to our great shame, that until we went to Chester Ave Avere perfectly ignorant of that peculiar disposition of Roman camps and cities, or that if Ave ever were informed of it in our school days, Ave had completely forgotten it. After a substantial dinner Ave set out on our customary reconnoitring expedition. Having noticed, on leaving the hotel, the rails of the tramway, Ave followed the tracks which, as we had anticipated, led to the town proper, for the station of Chester is situated at about half a mile from the ramparts or walls which surround the old toAvn, the only portion of The Oldest House in Chester. Chester which to the stranger is of interest, as the new streets and terraces and roads are exactly like those of other country towns. A short walk through what may be called the outer toAvn soon brought us to the East, gate, and into the old town. From the station to that gate the streets are lined with houses, modern for the greater part, with here and there an ancient and venerable looking building, such as the curious old toll-house which bridges over the footway, and can be compared to a house through which a tunnel has been bored, leaving one room on one side of the footway and the rest on the other side. Another interesting house is that of a butcher wdiich R 2"], [156, "SKETCHES OF ENGLAND. 124 overhangs the passage way, and is supported by huge Avooden props painted red, looking as unsafe as anything can possibly be, and yet which has stood there for a century or two. In that part of Chester the public-houses and taverns are numerous and, as everywhere else, are easily distinguishable by their brilliantly lighted fronts and the wide beam of light they throw on the pavement in front of them. It was easy to see that they were doing a very good trade, as they were all full of people whose voices could be heard from the outside, and before the door of every one of them a sort of overflow meeting was held by a number of people, working men, women, and soldiers, who were talking and discussing what must have been an event of some importance. A large crowd was moving in this Avide thoroughfare Avhich we naturally took as being the working population, enjoying a fine evening walk after a day's hard toil. The only thing that struck us Avas their numbers, for we had no idea that Chester was so populated ; it should also be. added that the animation prevailing not only in the outskirts, but also in the central parts of the town, surprised us very much, and induced us to put do*wn the people of Chester as being among the liveliest, gayest, and most easy-going of Her Majesty's subjects. It is not quite certain Avhether we did not \u2014 very rashly, no doubt\u2014 at once draw a comparison between the Welsh people we had seen at Carnarvon, and who appeared to take their pleasure so sadly, and the English population of Chester, who seemed so jolly and, as we say in French, happy to be in the Avorld, and embark in a long discussion and endless considerations on the idiosyncrasies of the races, and so on. Fortunately our speculations were suddenly brought to a close on our being informed an hour later that the animation we had noticed was quite unwonted and exceptional, and was due, that evening, to a large influx of visitors from all parts of the country on account of the Chester races, the last of which had been run that day. After passing Eastgate, which is not a striking edifice, we found ourselves in the old town, and it seemed as if we had passed not only from a modern into an ancient city, but as if we had also gone back several centuries and suddenly found ourselves in the Middle Ages. For Chester is as unlike any other city as possible, and has an originality, a quaintness so essentially belonging to itself, that it can be compared to no other place. With its narrow streets poorly lighted by gas lamps few and far between, lined with curious houses whose fronts are carved and ornamented, whilst their roofs are capriciously serrated, it recalls to mind the old German medi\u00e6val cities such as we see represented in old books and prints. The indented skyline broken by gables, turrets, and other quaint architectural devices is, at night, one of the most charming things that can be seen. But the most curious feature of Chester is the peculiar arrangement of its streets or rows, which is unique, and for this reason difficult to describe. Let us, however, try and give an idea of the \"rows\"; they can be roughly described as two-story streets, the lower story only having a carriage-way. There are shops on both stories, but whilst the passage-Avay of the lower story is open, that of the upper story is covered, the shops on that higher level being, as one might say, in the back parlour, the front parlour forming a continuous covered promenade. The lower shops are much inferior to the"], [157, "CHESTER. 125 higher ones, and it is very curious to see a hair-dresser's shop under a butcher's or a shoemaker's under a confectioner's. The houses, as a matter of course, overhang the covered way and rest on wooden columns or supports, some of which are remarkable for their carvings, mouldings, and ornaments ; as also the roofs, some of which are divided into sunk panels tastefully decorated. All the streets do not present that peculiarity, but only, or at least chiefly, the four main streets which, starting from The Rows. Chestei a common centre near St. Giles's Church, extend as nearly as possible in the direction of the four points of the compass. We wandered for hours in the \" rows,\" going first on one side and then on the other to enjoy the sight of the beautiful sky-line on either side, and going up and down at each crossing (a serious drawback and a rather fatiguing"], [158, "126 SKETCHES OF ENGLAND. process, by the way), until the appearance of the now deserted and silent streets warned us that it was high time to turn in, which we did, but not without dallying on the way, delighted with what we had seen, and looking forward with much pleasure to a more exhaustive survey the next day. Well, we must regretfully confess that our expectations Avere not quite realised when avc saw Chester the next morning, and for this reason. With an artistic feeling which greatly reflects to their credit, the people of Chester, when they rebuild their houses, erect them on the model of the ancient constructions, so that the city retains its medi\u00e6val aspect Avhich is its greatest charm. In the daytime, however, the new buildings are too easily distinguishable from the old ones. Time has not yet given them that harmonious colour Avhich lends so much beauty to really old houses, and the result is a somewhat unpleasant contrast. At night, on the contrary, the whole ofthe town being enveloped in darkness, the outlines of the projecting stories, of the gables, and serrated roofs, have a quaint and ancient appearance wdiich is truly delightful, and the play of the rays of light from above on the dark pavement of the narrow streets, produces a number of weird shadows of a very remarkable effect. On a fine moonlight night, when the rows are deserted, Chester is the nearest approach that one can think of to a city of the Middle Ages, such as Gustave Dore was fond of depicting in his illustrations of medi\u00e6val tales. Truly the appearance of a stray policeman or two in the regulation helmet and blue coat somewhat spoiled the picture, and policemen in Chester ought to wear the costume of the beefeaters of the Tower of London. If, seen by daylight, Chester is not so picturesque in its entirety as it is by night, it is nevertheless exceedingly interesting, as the architectural details of many buildings, old and new, are seen to great adAantage. In Watergate Street there is a very curious house, Avith a pointed gable and decorated front of great richness of ornamentation. Like all the houses in Chester it is a narrow and comparatively lofty building. It is decorated with wooden balustrades elaborately carved, and the facade is divided by caryatids into a number of compartments in which an artist has represented various biblical scenes, interspersed with coats of arms and heraldic devices. The scenes from the Bible are wonderfully quaint and naive, and are an excellent specimen of primitive art. This house, if we remember rightly, is called Bishop Lloyd's house. Another house in the same street is more profusely if not so quaintly decorated. It is called \" God's Providence House,\" because on a beam over the first floor is inscribed this sentence : \u2014 \" GOD'S PROA'IDENCE IS MINE INHERITANCE.\" The whole of the front is divided into compartments filled with ornamental sculpture of a floral character. This house has evidently been lately repaired, if not wholly rebuilt on the model of the old construction. It is said that the inscription on this house is an allusion to the plague of 1652, when the city of Chester was almost depopulated, and the inhabitants of this house were among the few who survived the epidemic."], [159, "CHESTER. 127 Bridge Street also contains many curious old houses, and modern ones built in the style of the ancient dAvellings still remaining. One of the genuine old houses is so constructed that the top stories appear to be much older than the lower ones. In addition to its curious architecture and streets, Chester has a number of nooks and corners which are an inexhaustible source of delight to the artist and tourist. Here and there, under a doorway an alley extends disclosing a bit of blue sky ; a few steps hung, as it were, to the walls, lead to the upper stories through openings the existence of which no one would ever have suspected. In these courts and alleys, children innumerable play in the gutter, ragged but looking healthy and happy, whilst women in tattered garments, over which a shawl is thrown, placidly look on with indolence, or gossip in a corner, now and then addressing some remonstrance in anything but mild language to the youngsters, and resuming their interrupted conversation. These women, who appeared to us to be in abject misery and poverty, to judge from their costume, did not seem to suffer from want of food, and it was to us a matter of astonishment how they live, as they certainly never do any work. This idle female population is a remarkable feature in English popular life, and in every town we visited, the same fact struck us very forcibly. To all our inquiries on the subject we obtained only one reply : \" Oh, they are Irish women.\" If so, the Irish population in England must be so considerable that the question arises, Avhere are the poor Englishwomen ? We strongly suspect that stereotyped reply to be a sort of satisfaction given to that very curious feeling so common in England, that whatever is wrong or irregular or not strictly in accordance with the recognised rules of propriety, cannot be English. This feeling is so strong that it has given birth to the very curious adjective \" un-English,\" the meaning of which is as comprehensive as it is vague. Anything or any act which it is wanted to stigmatise is at once put down as \" un-English,\" and everything and everyone having been struck with this epithet is supposed never to get over it and is doomed for ever and ever. In any case it is a curious idiosyncrasy, that which has led a nation to coin this extraordinary word as an opprobrious term to be used when the occasion seems to require some more than usually condemnatory expression. Chester, or rather the old city, is enclosed by walls dating from the fifteenth or sixteenth centuries, but resting, it is said, on Roman foundations. The walls form an uninterrupted promenade from which a very good view of the old and modern towns can be had, and also of the surrounding country, particularly on the west and south sides. The old city of Chester, as evidenced by the ramparts, was as nearly as possible square in shape, and the west walls were formerly laved by the Dee, that is in the time, now very remote, when Chester was effectively, what it is still in name, a port. Now there is a race-course, and a very fair one, too, on the spot where in olden times vessels used to sail right up to the walls, which still bear heavy iron rings to which ships were moored. We started from the Eastgate to walk round the walls, having the new town, the railway and factories on our right, and the Cathedral on our left. The Cathedral is a reddish edifice,"], [160, "SKETCHES OF ENGLAND. 128 the aspect of which from the ramparts is not very striking, because it does not rise to a sufficient height above the surrounding buildings. The ramparts form a rather narrow promenade, with a stone parapet on the outer side and a light and primitive-looking wooden railing on the inner side. They have been repaired and restored at various times, and have a very modern look about them. We soon reached the first, or Ph\u0153nix Tower, situated at the angle of the east and north walls. It is a circular tower, not very lofty, with a flight of steps leading to the upper story. Above the door is an inscription recalling the defeat of Charles I.'s army by the Parliamentary forces on Rowton Moor. It runs thus : KING CHARLES STOOD ON THIS TOWER, SEPTR. 24, 1645, AND SAW HIS ARMY DEFEATED ON ROWTON MOOR. It is to be supposed that the weather was clearer on the 24th of September, 1645, than it Avas on the 24th of September, 1886, exactly two hundred and tAventy-one years after the battle, when we visited it, for although the attendant tried his best to enable us to see the \"very spot\" where the fight took place, we saw nothing but a somewhat thick grey mist. What interested us most in the Ph\u0153nix Tower was the old attendant, who sells guides and souvenirs of Chester manufactured probably in Birmingham, and who is an inveterate joker. His special duties appear to consist in propounding conundrums to the visitors, most of which are remarkable for their antiquity and inanity, but the old man is so con*vinced of their superior merit, and enjoys them so much, that one is constrained to laugh, not at his jests but at his unconsciousness, which really is astounding. We gave him a small gratuity which he fully deserved, as he had entertained us a good deal more than he thought, and we left him to the undisturbed enjoyment of his jokes and conceits, some of which, cut from comic (?) and other papers, are carefully encased by him between two pieces of glass stuck together, and exhibited with evident pride at being the possessor of such valuable documents. But the Ph\u0153nix Tower is as nothing compared to the Bonwaldesthorne and Water ToAvers, both of which haAre been converted into museums. It must be confessed that a more heterogeneous collection of useless and valueless things it has never been our lot to see. There are many booths and travelling museums to be seen in fairs aud markets in France which would compare favourably with the two museums in the Bonwaldesthorne and Water Towers. In the Bonwaldesthorne so-called Museum we found in close proximity the folloAvino articles, the value of which we leave the reader to judge for himself. A fan made from the stem of a cabbage-leaf (South Africa) ; the skin of an alligator ; one or two Indian gods, on"], [161, "CHESTER. 129 the authenticity of which it would be rash to express an opinion ; a model of a locomotive by Stevenson ; the chair of Bishop Goodman (1598) ; a Chinese woman's shoe ; and a plaster cast of the foot of Queen Victoria. The foot of the Queen did not attract our attention, and the keeper of the Museum, avIio happened to be as solemn an individual as could be met with in a day's Avalk, taking pity on our ignorance and stung to the quick by our want of appreciation of the exhibits of the establishment over which he kept watch and ward, drew our notice to this plaster cast, which he took up with becoming respect and dignity. \" This, gentlemen,\" said, he in awe-inspiring tones, \"is the model of the foot of Her Majesty the Queen.\" The artist and the SCribe The Walls, Chester both nodded assent. \" Do you see nothing very extraordinary in the conformation of this foot?\" continued the man, holding the foot in one hand, pointing to it with the other, and speaking with increased gravity. The artist and the scribe looked at the plaster cast and nodded dissent. \"Well, gentlemen, there is something very remarkable in this foot, and I Avill show you S"], [162, "SKETCHES OF ENGLAND. 130 what it is.\" The artist and the scribe were breathless, and listened with redoubled attention, in the hope of increasing their little store of knowledge. \"You see, gentlemen,\" said the man, \"the big toe is shorter than the others, and that is a remarkable thing.\" The artist and the scribe were, as may be supposed, vastly amused at this display of anatomical knowledge, but managed to keep their countenance. \"Well, gentlemen,\" the keeper resumed, \"it is said that ladies whose feet present this extraordinary feature have great influence over their husbands, and this explains AAdiy the Queen's influence over the Prince Consort was so great.\" We looked surprised, and the man, conscious of his superiority over two foreigners to Avhom he had imparted valuable information, replaced the plaster cast on a shelf. We then resumed our exploration, greatly amused at what we had heard. When we got to the Water Tower the door was closed and a youth ran for the key. After a short time he came back with it, and ushered us into Museum number two, where we saw a statue of Napoleon, and a few Japanese fans, together with an old water tank, the Avhole being in a state of confusion, having nothing artistic about it. It must, however, be confessed that to place these various articles in a kind of classified order wrould have taxed the organizing genius of the ablest museum keeper in the kingdom. As it is, the only wonder is that it is thought worth any one's AAdiile to keep this collection of odds and ends AArhich might at best be taken for the stock of some third-rate provincial curiosity shop. Our astonishment was much increased when, a few days after our visit to Chester, we were informed by a friend to AA'hom we were speaking of these so-called museums, that they had recently opened at Chester a A'ery handsome museum and school of art, erected at great expense. What is in the new museum our friend was unable to tell us, but it is to be hoped that henceforward it will be made a punishable offence to call museums the two towers and their contents, and that the new institution will make it widely known that there is no connection between it and the other establishments on the ramparts. The people of Chester should be congratulated on having built a museum ; but why, Avhen strangers are asking if there is a museum in their city, are they sent to the towers on the walls ? and why is everybody silent about the new institution and the school of art, of Avhich not a word was breathed to us in answer to our inquiries ? There is, near the Water Tower, a small garden in which are preserved some broken columns and other fragments of an old Roman hypocaust, but for some reason or other, Ave could not obtain admittance to this enclosed ground, and were, to our regret, compelled to look on from the walls. The various fragments of tiles and other relics of the Roman bath are neatly piled up in cairns, and the whole might be taken at a distance for a small church-yard. A gilt statue of Queen Anne and a coat-of-arms carved in stone were among the curiosities we noticed in the Adcinity of the Water Tower, together with an old .Roman mosaic of comparatively little interest. Resuming our walk round the old city of Chester, we passed over the line of railway which is now carried under the walls and, after looking at the Water Gate, saw the"], [163, "CHESTER. 131 large race-course and grand stand where, a day or two before, the Chester Cup had been run for. The Castle did not come up to our expectation. It is a so-called Grecian building that might be mistaken for a theatre, an exchange, a railway station, or anything else, and strangely out of place in a picturesque town like Chester. On the contrary, the county gaol looks as unpleasant a building as can be imagined, and looks, every brick of it, a prison. From this point the view of the Dee, crossed by an old stone bridge, is very pictur esque, as on the opposite bank of the river, the Queen's Park, with its bright verdure, forms a lovely green spot contrasting pleasantly with the grey stones of the walls and prison, and the spire of the churches standing near the Bishop's Palace, beyond which again extends the Grosvenor Park. From the walls Bridge Street and its old houses are seen to much advantage. There is, near the ramparts, a new house rebuilt on the same lines as one that stood there before, with a curious front of ornamental plaster-work set in timber frames, with large windows formed of hundreds of small panes of glass set in lead, which is an excellent example of the style of architecture prevailing in Chester. We were not much impressed, we are bound to add, with the Cathedral, the exterior of which has been entirely rebuilt, whilst the interior has also been considerably altered, repaired, and modernised of late. There was the usual difficulty in seeing it, as access could only be had to the nave, and we had to wait a long time before one of the vergers could be induced to take us round, Avhich he did in a very slovenly and perfunctory manner, and with the air of a man who is tremendously bored. Contrary to the wont of his tribe, this gentleman of the black robe was far from talkative, and very little information could be got out of him ; however, on receiving a gratuity at the conclusion of our rapid survey of the church, he condescended to express his thanks in a feAV hurriedly mumbled words accompanied by a very ugly grin, apparently meant to do duty for a smile. The loquacious verger is a great nuisance, but the taciturn verger is a greater one, because if you are not obliged to listen to the former, yet while he talks you have time to look round ; with the latter, on the contrary, you are hurried through choir, transepts, and cloisters, and locked out of the church before you have had an opportunity of seeing anything. We had just time, however, to look at the two heads of Lord Beaconsfield and Mr. Gladstone, carved in stone on the wall of the Cathedral during the restoration, and repre senting political contention and religious contention. The likenesses are tolerably good, but the heads are caricatures rather than portraits, and it may be questioned whether the walls of a cathedral, even when looking on a churchyard, and hidden from view by clumps of trees, are a proper place for political caricatures and artistic jokes. Chester being a cathedral city, it is needless to add that the Salvation Army is well represented in the town. It has a large hall near the railway station, where its generals, colonels, captains, and other officers of both sexes, rant and howl at their ease and to the s 2"], [164, "SKETCHES OF ENGLAND. \u25a03-* discomfort of the neighbourhood, with the accompaniment of a brass band which can be heard from the railway station. Happening to be in the vicinity one Sunday afternoon we entered the hall. At the door stood a man in a red jersey, who directed us to some seats where we sat down for a few minutes, looking at the strange scene before us, of some tAvo or three hundred people listening to the absurd talk of another man in a jersey, and at intervals joining in a song the words of which were perfectly idiotic, whilst the tune was that of some popular music hall melody, very familiar to us as having originated in a Parisian cafe chantant. We soon had enough of it, as may be well supposed, and left. One of us asked the man at the door what Avas going on in the hall as, being strangers, we could not quite understand what the people we had seen inside were doing. The astonishment and comic indignation depicted on the Salvation warrior's face at this bland inquiry was something delightful, and Avould baffle eAren the artist's efforts were he to try and reproduce the expression of his countenance. In spite of its picturesqueness Chester is a place where no one could wish to make a prolonged stay, and we left it without regret."], [165, "CHAPTER XL LLANBERIS, SNOWDON, CAPEL CURIO. LANBERIS has been called the Chamonix of Wales, just as Snowdcnia has had bestowed upon it the name of Switzerland of Wales. With regard to \u25a0SCj-o\"^ Llanberis, if in calling it the Welsh Chamonix the object is to imply that like the little village at the foot of Mont Blanc it is the head-quarters of tourists, and the starting point of climbers intending to go up Snowdon, at the base of which it lies, there is no objection to the assimilation. But as regards Snowdonia, there is certainly no reason why it should be compared to Switzerland, with which it has but little likeness. It is very hard to understand why people always will compare one thing with another, wholly irrespective of the merits of either. Why they should call Snowdonia a Welsh Switzerland passes comprehension. For it is only misleading people into the belief that this part of the Principality is similar to the land of William Tell, than which a greater mistake could not be made. The beauties and attractions of Wales are sufficient to induce visitors to come to the Principality or they are not. If they are, it is because they have distinctive and characteristic features of their own ; if they are not, it is absurd to deceive people by appealing to their recollection of the Alps, as that can only lead to disappointment and comparisons which cannot be to the advantage of Wales. Then again, to dub Wales the British Switzerland is almost an admission that Welsh scenery has not proved sufficiently attractive on its own merits. Can anything be more unwise ? If we were asked what makes the great charm of Welsh scenery, we would, for our part, declare most emphatically that it is precisely its peculiar appearance, unlike anything we haATe seen in the Alps or Pyrenees, and that it is worth seeing if only for that very reason. If Wales were a kind of Switzerland, of Auvergne, or of Pyrenean region, the best thing to do would be to give it as wide a berth as possible, and not to go near it on any account, as an imitation, however good, is never equal to the original. Wales then has claims of its own that cannot be denied, and it is on its merits alone that it should appeal to the tourist, and not by means of far-fetched and inaccurate comparisons with the Alps or any other European mountainous district. Llanberis is situated at a distance of about two miles from the railway station of that name, at the entrance of the celebrated pass. It is a village of some two thousand inhabitants, Avho for the great majority earn their living by working at the neighbouring slate quarries. But tourists and visitors as a rule see very little of the village, as the inns are all in the vicinity of the railway station and of the two lakes."], [166, "SKETCHES OF ENGLAND. 134 The larger lake, or Llyn Padarn, is seen long before reaching Llanberis, or rather the con geries of hotels and boarding-houses which it is the custom to call by that name, as both the railway and the road skirt this fine sheet of water named after Saint Paternus or Padarn, who, it is said, lived a hermit's life on the shore of the lake or, at all events, in the neighbouring valley. Llyn Padarn is about two miles in length, and very nanw. Being situated in a comparatively open part of the valley it lacks the picturesqueness of the smaller lake, from Which it is separated by a meadow. The two lakes, however, are connected by a narrow stream, on which a bridge carries a road leading from Llanberis to the slate quarries. This stream is the Seoint, and runs to Carnarvon, where it terminates its short course after laving the Avails of the castle. The upper lake, or Llyn Peris, is smaller but much more beautiful than the other ; it is surrounded by tall mountains, which seem to rise out of the water, on whose smooth and calm surface their rugged sides and fantastic forms are reflected as in a mirror. The circle of hills being very irregular in shape, the lake presents a number of creeks or small bays of an intensely picturesque aspect, to which it owes its ever* changing appearance according to the point from Avhich it is seen. The view of the lake from the zigzag road on the flanks of the slate mountain is A'ery striking and almost sublime, especially at sunset, when the effects of light and shade on the mountains and the water are truly wonderful. At the loAver end of this lake, in the grounds of the Victoria Hotel, on a small eminence, stands an old round tower, the only remaining portion of an ancient fortress called Dolbadarn Castle. It may be here mentioned that the name means the meadow of Padarn, from which it may be inferred that the holy man after whom the larger lake is called had made this part of the valley his abode. The castle is said to have been built in the sixth century, and to have been an important stronghold, on account of its commanding position at the head of the pass of Llanberis, leading into the mountain districts, which were defended on the coast by the castles of Carnarvon, Criccieth, and Harlech, and on the other side by another fortress at Dohvyddelan, near Capel Curig. Llewelyn, the last Prince of Wales, kept his brother Owen Goch imprisoned in this castle for upwards of twenty years as a punishment for rebellion, and a Welsh bard has made this incident the subject of an ode, Avhich is looked upon by Welsh scholars as a masterpiece of native poetry. In the reign of Edward I. the Earl of Pembroke laid siege to Dolbadarn Castle, then defended by Llewelyn ap Gruffydd, and in the time of Henry IV. and of Henry V. it was again and again taken and retaken by parties contending for the possession of the strategical key to this region. As it now stands, the tower of Dolbadarn is a picturesque ruin of cylindrical shape. It had originally three floors, and was entered, some arch\u00e6ologists say, by outside stairs leading to the second story. Whether it was so or not matters very little, as also at what precise period it was erected ; all we can say, after having seen it, and walked round it, is that it is a striking and very artistic feature in the landscape, and that it adds considerably to the beauty of the scenery. Having reached Llanberis late on a Saturday afternoon, we were somewhat in doubt as to Avhether we should be able to go up Snowdon the next day, that is, if guides could be obtained"], [167, "LLANBERIS, SNOWDON, CAPEL CURIG. 135 on the Sabbath, and Ave were the more anxious not to delay our expedition twenty-four hours as the weather was fine and the atmosphere clear. Under the circumstances, a post ponement would have seemed to us very little short of disastrous. Fortunately we found that there was nothing to prevent us from putting our plans into execution, and our minds being set at rest on this score we felt perfectly happy. And having dined, we adjourned to the billiard room, when the size of an English billiard table greatly astonished the artist, whose dream was to be the owner of a piece of ground of equal super ficial area in Baris. \" What a lovely little house I would build on it ! \" he used to say with a sigh. The next morning happened to be glorious. The sun shone brilliantly, and its warm rays were tempered by a gentle breeze ; the atmosphere, too, was clear and gave every pros pect of a fine view when we reached the summit of Snowdon. We never theless provided ourselves with the The Slate Quarries, Llanberis. usual wraps and coats, and mounted the ponies we had bespoke the night before. We, however, only applies to the scribe and a lady and gentleman whom he joined, for the artist, with characteristic obstinacy, and confidence in his powers of endurance, peremptorily refused the assistance of any four-footed animal whatsoever, to ascend the highest mountain in the United Kingdom. The scribe, less proud and more ponderous, got astride a little pony called Jenny, and the caravan, headed by a guide, set out on its way to Y Wyddfa, as the"], [168, "SKETCHES OF ENGLAND. 136 highest point of Snowdon is named. The altitude of Snowdon being only 3,590 feet, it is hard to understand why it has received its significant appellation, the meaning of which is \"snowy height,\" for except in winter it is very unlikely that much snow is to be found on its summit or sides. Passing out of the grounds of the Victoria Hotel, we soon found ourselves on the path Avhich we were told was the most easy and agreeable, and less steep, less rocky, and less dangerous than any other. One or two gates we met on our way had to be opened by the keeper before we could proceed, as Snowdon happens to be on the estate of some rich land owner whose name we could not remember, and if we did, would be of very little interest to any one. However, the owner of Snowdon deserves to be congratulated on his disinter estedness ; he charges nothing to the tourists who go up his mountain, whilst other people, who have much less beautiful things to show, have no hesitation in extorting a fee from visitors. Having had some little experience in mountain climbing, we are compelled to say that the path appeared to us one of the easiest we had ever found on any mountain, and as to danger of any kind, we failed to see how the road from Llanberis could, except by a stretch of imagination, be credited with being dangerous in the slightest degree. It may be that in very foggy weather one might lose his way and wander helplessly about, but the same thing often happens in the streets of London, to which must be added the far greater risk of being run over by one of the innumerable vehicles of all kinds to be met in the thoroughfares of the metropolis. Far from complaining of this absence of difficulty and danger in the ascent of Snowdon, we are of opinion that it greatly adds to the pleasure of the excursion. A sprinkling of danger is to many people an inducement to attempt certain feats of which, we think, too much has been said, for after all the only object is to acquire cheap popularity and to be talked about for twenty-four hours in the newspapers. \"The fastest on record,\" \"the longest on record,\" \"the maddest on record,\" whether they apply to a bicycle tour, a pedestrian feat, the shooting of the Niagara rapids in a beer-barrel, or a fasting experiment, are nothing but money-making or advertising devices, and should be looked upon in the same light as the announcement that \"Madame X. and Signor Z. have used Somebody's Insect Powder, and prefer it to any other,\" because they answer no useful purpose and can lead to no public good or advantage. People who go up mountains do so for their own enjoyment, and not with a view to improve the moral and material condition of their fellow-creatures. If, in addition, they feel a particular anxiety to break their necks, that is their affair ; but there is no reason Avhy they should parade before the world as martyrs if they come to grief, or as heroes if they escape scot-free from their foolhardy undertakings. Having no ambition to be either martyrs or heroes, we selected the Llanberis route and we had every reason to congratulate ourselves on the choice. The pathway up tl mountain is rocky in the extreme, and is at the same time the bed of a streamlet running water for a considerable distance. The ponies manage to pick their way an"], [169, "ON THE TOP OF SNOWDON"], [170, ""], [171, "LLANBERIS, SNOWDON, CAPEL CUR/G. 137 the stones with great care and cleverness, and are as sure-footed as the mules of Alpine regions ; and as they knoAV the Avay as Avell as the guides themselves, the only thing the tourist has to do is to let the animal go its own way, and look round and enjoy the scenery. As Ave ascended, leaving behind us the valley and lakes of Llanberis, Ave could see a number of smaller lakes, far and near, nestling in the holloAvs between the innumerable ridges radiating in all directions from the main knot of which SnoAvdon is the centre. When we Avere about half-way up the temperature became suddenly very cold, a fresh breeze blowing from the south-east ; but as we went on and neared the summit it got warmer again, and we could doff the great-coats we had found necessary to put on. Within two miles of the top, the scenery, hitherto pretty, assumed a remarkable aspect of wild grandeur ; the path lay along a narrow ridge, on either side of Avhich deep precipices formed yawning chasms between the buttresses and spurs of Snowdon ; at the bottom of these precipices were lakes and lakelets of various singular shapes shining under the rays of the sun like sheets of burnished gold, or sheltered from the light and reflecting the tall and rugged heights around. One of these small lakes, in a deep hollow at the foot of an abrupt rock rising like a huge wall, presented a smooth surface of a peculiar malachite-green colour of the most ex traordinary effect. The unusual tint of the water is in all probability due to the copper beds through which it is filtered ; but it is to be noted that the intensity of the colour varies according to the amount of light thrown on the lake. When we went up the rock threw its shade over it, and the green colour was remarkably bright ; on our return the shade was removed and the light played upon the lake, whose waters were still green, but of a much deadened hue. At a Snowdon Spring. A little further we met the zigzag path leading from Capel Curig to Snowdon. At this spot the mountains were nothing but gigantic masses of rock, rugged and barren, save in places where small patches of grass afforded but meagre pasture to the few sheep that Avere wandering on the hills ; here and there heather grew on the sides of the height, as also Avild flowers in abundance. Up to Avithin a very few yards of the summit, and until passing the spring which is said to be the highest and coldest in Wales, the path is comparatively easy ; but even in the steepest part it is not necessary to dismount, so that practically the ascent of Snowdon from Llanberis to the very top of the mountain can be accomplished on horseback. The summit, or Y Wyddfa, is a small plateau about thirty feet in diameter, on which a conical cairn, surmounted by a sort of cage, has been erected by the officers of the Ordnance I"], [172, "SKETCHES OF ENGLAND. 138 Survey as a landmark. A kind of dry stone Avail forms a parapet and enclosure, where two or three wooden huts, rejoicing in the name of \"Summit Hotel\" in the various guide-books and on maps, have been built to serve as shelter for the enthusiastic tourists desirous of witnessing the rising of the sun from Snowdon. From this place there is a magnificent view over the mountain, and the ridges and shoulders radiating from it ; these are so rugged and abrupt that the hollows appear deeper than they really are. A number of tarns and lakes\u2014 we were told that twenty-four can be seen, but we did not count them \u2014 glitter in all directions like bright gems set in dark metal ; and the various paths from Llanberis, Beddgelert, and Capel Curig, winding up the sides of the mountains covered with heather and wild flowers, look like thin yellow threads on a rich mantle of purple velvet. Between the spurs and buttresses of the mountains a large expanse of country with pretty valleys, intersected by streamlets running among dark green meadows, stretched before our eyes, and above, the sun shed its bright rays over hill and dale ; here and there light Avhite clouds intercepted the sunrays, sometimes suddenly show ing a gleaming lake where none was seen before, and sometimes darkening a hitherto sunny spot which seemed threatened with an impending storm. The accommodation provided for tourists in the three huts erected on the summit of Snowdon is of the most Avretched and insufficient kind, and the food offered to the hungry climber of the most inferior description, although the charges are simply exorbitant. Here again the comparison between SAvitzerland and Wales is as inappropriate as possible, for whereas in the former country little hotels, situated in well-nigh inaccessible places, where everything has to be carried on men's backs, manage to give tourists decent food, here on Snowdon, which can be reached by ponies, there is practically nothing to be had. After an ineffectual attempt to swallow a feAv morsels of nondescript food, for Avhich we paid at an enormous rate, Ave mounted our ponies again to return to Llanberis. The return journey was as pleasant as the ascent had been, but the view was not quite so beautiful, as the mist was pressing round and contracting the horizon. In some places the shifting of the shadows gave to particular spots a very different aspect to that which they had a few hours before ; some times this Avas an advantage, sometimes the reverse, as in the case of the green lake, which, owing to this cause, had lost much of its charm when avc passed it the second time on our way back. Having arrived within a mile or so of the Victoria Hotel, Ave dismounted, dismissed our guide, and went across the fields to the Ceunant Mawr Waterfall, Avhich is easily reached both from the mountain side and from Llanberis, that is, the tourists' Llanberis, not the village, Avhich is about two miles further. This Avaterfall is formed by a number of streams descending from the neighbouring heights, which unite in the valley, run through a pretty glen, and rush over a barrier of dark rocks into a deep chasm. The height of the fall is about sixty feet, and the sheet of water in its fall betAA'een the second ledge of rocks and the pool below is tAvisted into a curious shape, something like the blade of a steamer's screw.

Near the Avaterfall there is a small village or hamlet of miners working in the slate quarries. They live in very good and well-built cottages with a small garden in front, and seem to be Arery happy, Avell-contentcd people. We were greatly struck with the neat, comfortable appearance of their homes, Avhich are furnished in a substantial fashion. The rooms are well papered and carpeted, the furniture is of a very fair description, strong and good, and e\\*erything inside is as tidy, polished, and clean as the deck of a man-o'-war. The stairs leading to the only storey above the ground floor are covered Avith a carpet protected by strips of holland or oil-cloth and secured by brass rods as bright as gold. The men, their wives, and children look exceedingly healthy, and Avear very good clothes ; they appeared to us a very superior lot of people to the agricultural labourers Ave had met in this region. We were told that the Avages of the miners range between \u00a35 10s. and \u00a36 10s, a month, and the rent they pay for the cottages is on an average \u00a37 10s. a year. The slate quarries are on the other or north-east side of the lakes, and are a source of prosperity to the neighbourhood, as they give employment to some three thousand men, and are considered the largest in Wales with the exception of the Penrhyn quarries. The latter are part of the same mountain and are situated at the opposite end ; the result will be that some day the Avhole hill will have been retailed in roofs, billiard tables, door plates, and slabs, and that the miners will find their occupation gone, whilst the Pennant and the Smith families will be left to mourn the disappearance of this wealth-producing hill. This is a remote contingency, no doubt, and ive at all events will not see it ; but it is none the less certain. As much of course can be said of coal mines, and in fact eA**ery mineral produce ; but it is consoling to the present generation at least, and those that will immediately follow, to think that we can go on consuming steam and gas without stint, as the present supply is likely to last longer than any of us. As to our great-grandsons, they will have electricity and probably other forces as yet undiscovered, and may be, for aught we know, much better off than Ave are at the present moment. Therefore there is no necessity to make ourselves uneasy on their account. Electricity, however, can hardly ever become a substitute for slate roofing. But that is no matter of ours; we can trust our great-grandsons to look after themselves, and, as dear Louis XV., the Beloved, used to say, apres nous le deluge. But we are wandering from our subject and tbe slate quarries, whither we must return. Crossing the bridge over the streamlet AAdiich links the two lakes, a wide road leads to the gate of the quarries, on Avhich a notice board warns the intending visitor that if he wishes to go over the quarry he must be provided Avith a guide, as it is dangerous to go about alone on account of the constant falling of huge blocks of slate detached from the hillsides. Another notice strikes his eye as he nears the entrance. It is painted on the rock itself, and reads as follows : Stick no Bills ! The idea of preventing this arch fiend, the bill-poster and adA-ertising contractor, from defacing the mountains and rocks is a good one, and any attempt in this direction must be pronounced praiseworthy, but Avhen the notice emanates from those t 2"], [174, "SKETCHES OF ENGLAND. 140 who are the worst offenders, i.e. the workers of the quarries, it conies with a bad grace. Not that we object in any way to the working of the quarries. Better that all the hills in Wales and elsewhere were razed than we should have to go without slates to our roofs, but when a mountain is being cut into by the quarrymen, a large poster or two will not much spoil the general appearance of the rest. The slate quarries are worked in the following manner. The mountain is divided in ledges about fifteen feet high, having the appearance of steps, that is of steps made for giants, and in them the men are busy with the pick, cutting and splitting the huge blocks detached from the solid rock. These are obtained by blasting, which goes on every hour from morning till night. Before the blasts a horn is sounded to give warning to the workmen, Avho take shelter in holes made for the purpose in the rock. The explosions soon follow after the sounding of the horn, and huge masses of rocks weighing as much as fifty tons, or even one hundred tons, roll down the sides of the hill, Avhilst the loud report of the explosion is echoed and re-echoed through the valley in thunder-like rumblings. Along the ledges or steps tramways have been laid on which a number of small trucks are running. The slates are placed into them and transferred at given points to other waggons, Avhich run up and down the inclines by means of wire ropes passing over pulleys, and draAvn by steam machinery. At the bottom of the inclines the slates are again placed in raihvay Avaggons and sent by a special line on to Carnarvon, or distributed among the numerous steam and Avater mills in the neighbourhood, Avhere they arc fashioned into slabs for various industrial purposes. In the evening, after our return from SnoAvdon and Ceunant MaAvr, Ave had a little excitement thrown in, in order to relieve what might otherwise have been the monotony of a compaiativel)*- eventless excursion. The artist, as Ave have said before, had declined joining our cavalcade, and had soon left us, preferring to go his own way, with his sketch book in his pocket and his large portfolio under his arm. When we reached the half-wTay hut we inquired after him, and were told that he had been seen, and so he had, for he had had time to sketch the old gentleman who keeps the refreshment room and a girl Avho happened to be there. Through sheer modesty, no doubt, the old gentleman did not tell us that he had been sitting to our friend, and that we should be able to gaze once more on his benevolent features as reproduced by the artist ; but that was a pleasure to come, and our Avorthy friend of the refreshment room considerately refrained from disclosing the fact, so that Avhen we came to see the sketch a day or two after it came upon us as a welcome surprise, the like ness being excellent. But this is digressing again. Let us resume. We renewed our inquiries at Y Wyddfa, and there again we learned that the artist, easily distinguishable because of his entire ignorance of the Queen's English, and of his artistic paraphernalia, which seemed to be part aud parcel of his own self, had left the summit of Snowdon on his Avay back to Llanberis. On our return we had just caught a glimpse of his brown soft felt hat in the neighbourhood of the Green Lake, and exchanged a few shouts, at the same time frantically waving our"], [175, "LLANBERIS, SNOWDON, CAPEL CURIG. 141 pocket handkerchiefs ; and as Ave had Avandered from the straight road in order to see the Waterfall, we fully expected to find him on our arrival at the hotel. But we Avere mistaken; he had not been near the place since early morning. The day being fine and the light good, we came to the conclusion that he was sketching, and went our way rejoicing. Night came on ; the dinner bell rang and summoned the ten inmates of the hotel to the spacious dining- room, larger than a good many small churches, and as cheerless as possible. The scribe took his seat at his accustomed place, with a vacant chair \u2014 that of the artist \u2014 on his left, but the artist did not put in an appearance, and the scribe, questioned as to his friend, could give but a very un- satisfactory ansAver. He had seen the artist in the dis- tance, near the Green Lake, four hours previously, and that was the only informa- tion it was in his power to give. Then some one began to tell stories of tourists Avandering hopelessly and helplessly on the Welsh mountains, of terrible catas- trophes having overtaken them, and of their being found by search parties dead and with mangled limbs at the bottom of a precipice, or starved to death after dreadful sufferings, or mad Avith fright after a night passed in some dangerous The Green Pool, Snowdon. spot where they could neither move forward nor backward wdthout fear of being dashed to pieces on the rocks below. Every one of the guests was ready wdth a thrilling or flesh-creeping story, and a lady mildly suggested that the artist might even have met Avith foul play. Upon which two ladies of sedate appearance and of mature age, Avho strongly reminded one of Miss Pinkerton and her sister Jemima, and who certainly were"], [176, "SKETCHES OF ENGLAND. 142 connected with an academy for young ladies (unless we are sadly mistaken), together cast a silent but eloquent glance at the scribe, as much as to say, \"You miserable wretch, what have you done with your friend?\" Although inwardly conscious of his perfect innocence, the scribe began to feel uneasy ; the vacant chair by his side seemed to reproach him with his callousness ; he fancied he could see in the looks of the guests assembled round the hospitable board of the Victoria Hotel a lurking suspicion, and the questions showered upon him from all sides seemed to him to savour more of the cross-examination than of the benevolent inquiry. Here was tt terrible situation ! Were his fellow-travellers suspecting him ? It looked very much like it. The two Miss Pinkertons Avere eyeing him with increased suspicion and grasping their cheese knives with a resolute and defiant air highly suggestive of their innermost feelings toAvards him. Fortunately at this juncture the waiter, who seemed to take pity on the s.ribe, entered the room, and with the hotel-keeper's compliments suggested that a search party should be organised and start at nine o'clock if by that time the artist had not returned. It was then about twenty minutes to that hour. Of course the scribe jumped at the suggestion, and his earnestness seemed to make a good impression on Miss Jemima, although the elder lady with a stern look rose and left the room. Dinner being over, all the guests followed, and the scribe remained behind, alone ! Dismal were his thoughts as he sipped a post-prandial cup of coffee in the solitary room, badly lighted by a few gas jets \u2014 the others having been turned out \u2014 the dark corners of Avhich seemed peopled with shadows of maimed climbers flitting by in a weird procession ; he even imagined he could see a well-knoAvn brown felt hat in an indistinct form hovering in a corner, Avhen he was suddenly awakened by a voice exclaiming, \" Here he is, sir ! \" For the scribe after the day's exertions had fallen asleep in the dining-room, and the waiter had just rushed in to inform him of the return of the artist, Avho had lost his AATay, although he never Avould admit it. A sigh of relief passed the scribe's lips, as he really had become afraid some mishap might have befallen the artist, and Avithout uttering a word he rushed to the draAvin \"-room in order to inform the assembled guests of his friend's safe return. The Avelcome news was received with general satisfaction ; the Miss Pinkertons Avho appeared to be somewhat ashamed of their unfounded suspicions, smiled benifnantly to the scribe, Avho experienced a sensation very similar \u2014 so one might think \u2014 to that of a prisoner in the dock ou hearing the foreman of the jury returning a verdict of not guilty. With this exciting incident our visit to Llanberis terminated, and the next day found us on the wing, for, like the Wandering JeAV, there was no rest for us, and Ave Avere condemned to go on until we reached our destination. For the first time we found ourselves out of the track of the iron horse, but not for a long time, and the change was welcome. What can be more enjoyable than to travel in fine; warm, summer weather, through a lovely country, with pleasant companions, in a comfortable carriage draAvn by two good horses ? How delightful not to be cooped up in a stuffy railway compartment and whisked from one station to another without having time"], [177, ""], [178, ""], [179, "A MOUNTAIN EXCURSION IN WALES"], [180, ""], [181, "LLANBERIS, SNOWDON, CAPEL CURIG. 143 to look round or to stop in order to admire a bit of scenery, but, on the contrary, to be able to go our way leisurely, slowly or fast at our OAvn sweet will, to dally in the midst of shady glens by the way, to walk among the fields by the roadside when so inclined, to interrupt our journey when convenient, and for as little or as long as Ave chose, and to resume it Avhen so disposed, Avithout being hustled by a guard and shouted at by a porter and desired somewhat roughly to \"jump in\" and \"take our seat.\" This mode of travelling is by itself agreeable enough, but it is doubly so Avhen the way lies through the Pass of Llanberis. We had heard a great deal of the Pass of Llanberis, we had read all that has been Avritten about it, and the praises lavished upon it by enthusiastic writers had almost prejudiced us against it. Such at least is the inevitable effect produced upon us nine times out of ten by the lyrical effusions and fits of hysterical ecstasy in Avhich local historians and descriptive Avriters occasionally indulge. The result is generally that, if one has taken them at their Avord, bitter disappointment follows. Well, we most emphatically agree with everything that has been said, Avritten, or sung in praise of the Pass o\u00a3 Llanberis, for it is fully deserved. The pass Avas formerly inaccessible to carriages, the only alternatives to the tourist being to Avalk er to ride through it ; but uoav as good a road as can be found anywhere traverses it from end to end, to the great advantage of visitors in general, and of those lazy beings like ourselves in particular, Avho prefer driving to the exertion involved in either walking or riding. For we must make the avoAval, however humbly, and with every consciousness of our Avant of pluck and energy, Ave have never yet been able to understand, and probably never will understand, why, when there are two ways of doing a thing, some people should choose the more uncomfortable, uneasy, and unpleasant of the two. We are quite aware that that kind of thing is called testing one's power of endurance, which may mean anything or nothing. May Ave be allowed to suggest the latter as the more likely, and to give our reasons Avhy Ave think so ? We met on our Avay two pedestrians, fine strapping young felloAVS of about twenty years of age, in the conventional costume adopted by gentlemen who are in the habit of indulging in athletic pastimes and sports, flannel A'est and trousers, heavy boots, and the double-peaked cap obligato \u2014 in fine, the usual thing. On they went, under a broiling sun, at a tremendous rate, smothered in dust from cap to toe, perspiring and sweltering, looking very red in the face and very uncomfortable, and yet hastening forth as if the fate of the United Kingdom, nay, of the British Empire, depended on their reaching their destination at a certain hour or within a given time. They looked neither to the left nor to the right, all their energies being directed to the task they had so gratuitously, as Ave thought. undertaken. Noav will any one contend that those two men enjoyed the scenery as well as Ave did? Is it not self-evident that, tired and fagged out as they Avere, they could not appreciate the beauties of the surrounding country as we, Avho stopped and looked as long as we pleased, turned round Avhen we liked and so forth, could ? They did not turn round, they shot straight before them, like an arrow. That they arrived at their destination in as"], [182, "SKETCHES OF ENGLAND. 144 short a time as possible avc make no manner of doubt, but did they enjoy the scenery, we ask again ? No, certainly not. But, it may be argued, they proved that they were able to accomplish a certain distance in a stated time. What of that ? And if they did, of what practical use was their performance? If it was intended to be a test of their endurance, the best way to do that would have been to put on a private soldier's uniform, with all the accoutrements, arms, and paraphernalia, in a wTord, to array themselves in full, regular marching order, aud then their experiment might perhaps have had some practical result. A man may walk so many hundred miles in so many days, another may swim across the Channel, a third may shoot the Niagara rapids in a barrel, a fourth may fast for fifty days ; but for all that people will prefer the railway, the steamer, abstention from shooting the Niagara or any other rapids, and the usual breakfast, lunch, and dinner system, to these curious and uninteresting new modes of making themselves miserable, as the ordinary miseries of life are perfectly sufficient without any newfangled ones being added to the already long list the human race possesses. It is very possible that this opinion of ours will considerably injure us in the mind of our readers, who will at once put us down as indolent, slovenly beings. We nevertheless unblushingly stick to it, so utterly beyond the possibility of being reclaimed are we certain to be. The road from Llanberis to the pass skirts the smaller lake, Llyn Peris, and lies through the village proper, which is inhabited chiefly by miners engaged in the slate quarries. Not far from Llanberis there is a renoAvned spring, the well of St. Peris, whose waters, cool and remarkably pure and limpid, Avere in former times supposed to \\ai\\e Avrought miraculous cures. This well also was credited with supernatural divinatory and predictive properties, a silver fish being the usual channel through which the oracles were uttered. The narrow defile which separates the Glyder FaAvr mountain on the north from Snowdon on the south is then entered. The road, said to be the highest in Wales, is wide and good, although in parts very steep ; on either side rise the abrupt sides of the mountains, like formidable titanic granite walls ; on the precipitous sides of the heights there is not a tree not a shrub, hardly a blade of grass to be seen. On both sides of the road immense blocks of rock detached from the mountain sides are lying about; one of them, a huge boulder erroneously called a cromlech, which it resembles, was once used as a shelter by an old woman named Hetty, and from this circumstance derived another name, under which it is sometimes designated, Adz. Ynys Hettws, or Hetty's Island. Within a short distance of the \" Cromlech \" there is, on the top of the mountain a curiously shaped rock, looking very much like an old ruined fortress, and to which on this account the name of the castle has been given. So much is this rock like a stronghold of former times that one of our party naturally mistook it for such, and asked our driver what Avas the name of this old castle. This part of the pass is certainly the most desolate and wild, and it assumes a character of grandeur which is almost awe-inspiring. A little further the highest point of the pass"], [183, "LLANBERIS, SNOWDON, CAPEL CURIG. 145 is reached. GorphAvysfa, \" the resting-place,\" is the appropriate name of this spot, where a little vegetation is to be seen, agreeably contrasting Avith the wild and barren rocks rising on all sides. Here a narrow path turns off in the direction of Snowdon, and is the route to that mountain which is generally taken by tourists who make the ascent from Capel Curig. Whilst the horses Avere being baited we went along a very good road to a distance of about a mile or so, to a spot where a very good view of Snowdon is obtained, the slender peak being from this point remarkably sharp, and standing out very clearly against the blue sky. From Gorphwysfa the road descends and bends rather sharply to the left ; it then runs parallel to a fine clear stream, the vieAV over the valley of Nant-y-Gwryd being very pretty. On the right, on the other side of the stream, the landscape assumes a less desolate and barren appearance ; two small lakes are then passed, after which Capel Curig is reached. Capel Curig, which should be pronounced Kappel Kerrig (the mysteries of Welsh pronun ciation are truly unfathomable), is in a very con venient situation for anglers, and for tourists intending to make the ascent of Snowdon. As we had stopped at Llanberis and been up the monarch of Welsh mountains, we had no reason to break our journey there except for a few minutes, which enabled us to see that Capel Curig is a great resort for artists. This is not to be wondered at, for the scenery there is very beautiful and varied, and affords to landscape painters an excellent field for the display of their talent and abilities. There is a particular spot, opposite a small roadside inn, on the wooded banks of a stream, which seems to be verv much ' */ in favour among artists of both sexes, for we saw under the shade of a clump of trees more than a dozen of them, sheltered under white umbrellas, easels before them, busy with pencil or brush, An Innkeeper on the Snowdon Road. and apparently from their position engaged in sketching the same bit of scenery, the two lakes and a small waterfall. At Capel Curig we had the last glimpse of Snowdon, towering high in the air, and looking down majestically on the surrounding mountains. Shortly before reaching Bettws-y-Coed we alighted at the gates of the Swallow Falls, or Rhayadr-y-Wennol as they are called in Welsh. Although we tried hard to ascertain the origin of the name bestowed upon them we could get no information on the subject ; the reason why we made the inquiry was that we had heard the Swallow Falls spoken of as a wonderful sight, and our curiosity had been awakened by the praises lavished on them. Truth compels us to say we were somewhat disappointed when we saw them. Like many u"], [184, "SKETCHES OF ENGLAND. 146 other sights in Wales the falls are carefully kept under lock and key. A small wicket gate at the roadside, where a boy is stationed to receive the usual fee (the amount of which, if we remember right, is left to the generosity of the visitors), leads to a rough path which is a combination of very steep inclines and wide rocky steps. At first nothing is seen of the falls, as the path lies through a curtain of trees and shrubs, but suddenly a sharp turn brings you right in front of the higher fall and almost immediately above the middle one, for the Llugwy, as the stream is called, rushes down the chasm in three leaps. From this coign of vantage the waters are seen gurgling and bubbling over the jagged barrier of rocks and leaping in a wide foaming sheet into the pool below, and then, as it were, resting awhile to rush over the second obstacle before reaching the final step, after which it resumes its impetuous course over a bed of stones in the direction of Bettws-y-Coed. The sides of the ravine in which the falls are situated are C0Arered with luxuriant vegetation and fine trees, and here and there large projecting rocks make the slopes look Avild and rugged, the Avhole giving to this lovely spot a character of undeniable grandeur. After a heavy rain, when the waters of the Llugwy are high, the falls assume a remarkable aspect ; unfortunately when we saw them, after a spell of dry weather, the body of water forming the cascade was rather \" thin,\" which detracted somewhat from the beauty of the scene."], [185, "CHAPTER XII. BETTAVS-Y-COED, CONWAY, LLANDUDNO. ETTWS-Y-COED (the Chapel in the Wood) is, as its name implies, in the midst of a wooded district, and is in striking contrast to the desolate and Avild country extending between it and Llanberis. After crossing the Pass of Llanberis the charming situation of Bettws-y-Coed produces on the traveller an extraordinary impression of relief as the lovely landscape spreads before him in endless variety. Here are gracefully undulating hills clothed with luxuriant verdure, there fresh shady walks, pleasant secluded glens, pretty murmuring streams gaily winding their way between verdant banks and hastening towards some rocky narrow defile, where they coquettishly fringe themselves with the whitest of foam as they dash over nature's obstacles, which she has distributed with the most consummate art, so as to throw into greater relief the beauties of the scenery. Human art is after all but a poor thing by the side of nature's art \u2014 a very trite saying this, no doubt, but like all hackneyed remarks it is but the expression of the unanimous feeling of men; and why should one refrain from recording an impression for the insufficient reason that somebody has said the same thing before ? If this were carried out to the letter, we wonder who would venture to say a word or write a line ? Bettws-y-Coed is a small village or hamlet composed of a number of detached houses of modern build \u2014 the fancy Gothic style, with boAV windows and gables predominating, \u2014 stretching along the road for over a mile. In front of the houses runs the old Holyhead road, parallel to the Llugwy, and beyond the stream the valley of Llanrwst extends, bounded by a circle of low hills. It goes without saying that on account of its particularly favourable situation, and the varied scenery abounding in the immediate vicinity, Bettws-y-Coed is the head-quarters of quite an army of artists. As a natural consequence artists' colourmen, frame makers, and photographic dealers are numerous, and picture dealers abound. At the end of many of the gardens which separate the houses from the road, after the style of suburban localities, there are glazed show cases in which paintings for sale are exhibited, with prices affixed thereto. A few of these Avorks of art were by no means bad, denoting considerable skill and technical dexterity on the part of the painters. We were told that a goodly number of artists reside permanently at Bettws-y-Coed, and spend their life in reproducing on canvas every nook and corner of interest or picturesque aspect in the locality, thus acquiring a remarkable ability in the rendering of the peculiarities of Welsh scenery, atmosphere, and colour. David Cox used to frequent Bettws-y-Coed and to take up his quarters at the Royal u 2"], [186, "SKETCHES OF ENGLAND. 148 Oak Hotel, to which we repaired. During one of his visits he painted the sign of the inn (which has since been rebuilt and has groAvn into a large hotel), and our first inquiry on our arrival was about this painting. It is kept with great care and reverence in the hall of the hotel, and in every lease granted by the owner of the property a special clause is inserted with regard to it. The sign as it is now requires judicious cleaning. It represents a land scape painted in sombre tones, the most remarkable feature in Avhich, as a matter of course, is a tall oak in full leaf extending its branches over a considerable area. Under its shade, St. George, on a white charger, is slaying a dragon of some kind, dimly visible at the foot of the tree. The artist unreservedly praised the landscape and the oak, but seemed to criticise rather sharply the steed and its rider. Bettws-y-Coed is an excellent starting place for excursionists to all parts of Snowdonia, and during the season there is a stream of coaches, carriages, and A'ehicles of all kinds rattling along the road skirting the village; occasionally a shrill whistle is heard, and light clouds of steam hovering above the trees in the distance are evident signs that we are again in touch of the railway and in communication with the rest of the world. At Bettws also we saw what we had not seen for several days, flys plying for hire ; for neither at Llanberis nor at Carnarvon, nor indeed since we had left London, had we set eyes on a cab, or rather a fly rank, where the only trouble to obtain a conveyance was simply to step into it and bid the driver to go wherever we chose. An American tourist once entered the Louvre Galleries in Paris, went straight to one of the attendants, pulled his watch out, and looking at the time told him, with the accent peculiar to the citizens of the States, \"Look here, I have to catch my train at 4.30; shoAv me all you can in five minutes.\" We were not exactly in such a hurry, but time was to us a consideration, and, besides, the weather had been very fine for the last fortnight or so, and we were afraid that a change might suddenly come over us, Avith the consequence that we should have to give up our intended excursions. We first drove to the Falls of the Conway, which are about three miles from Bettws-y- Coed, and a very pleasant drive it is, for the route lies through the wide road shaded by glorious trees on the side of which the village is built, then across the fine iron bridge spanning the Llugwy in one single arch of very elegant design, with the following inscription worked in the iron lattice : \" This bridge was built the same year that the battle of Waterloo was fought.\" The road then skirts the base of a wooded hill clothed with luxuriant foliage ; there are in the neighbourhood a number of very fine and delightfully situated houses, and it was surprising to see so many of them advertised for sale or hire as one would have thought that such pleasant summer residences would never be allowed to go begging. Probably this is but due to the hard times we are now living in, and from the effects of which Wales, like other parts of the world, suffers. About half-way to the Conway Falls the road forks, one branch of it, called the upper road, going to the falls, the other or lower road, descending towards the Fairy Glen. We of course followed the higher section, and a sharp turn soon brought us to our destination. Down a narrow road we went and soon found ourselves in a deep gorge, and a few more steps brought us right by the side of"], [187, "BETTWS-Y-COED, CONWAY, LLANDUDNO. 149 the ravine into Avhich the Conway and Machno, having united their waters, leap over a barrier of rocks. Precisely in the middle of the cascade we noticed a sort of buttress, made of strong substantial masonry, which at first we took to be a kind of support to prevent the upper ledge from falling, and we were wondering why the builders of this curious object had not used rough blocks of stone so as to imitate the natural rock. But, alas for our ignorance, which we humbly acknowledge, the \"buttress\" was a \"salmon ladder,\" that is a \"flight of A Miners' Village. stairs,\" without steps, to enable the delicious fish of the genus Saltno to ascend the river at spring time for spawning, as is their wont. Having a weakness for salmon, we could not but be grateful to the owner of the river for his foresight and consideration for the fish, but as tourists we could not, on the other hand, fail to condemn the intrusion in the landscape of this most prosaic feature. Thus we Avere divided between our gratefulness as gastronomers and our indignation as artists ; there Avas a"], [188, "SKETCHES OF ENGLAND. 150 struggle in our minds between these two feelings, and as we are ashamed to say which proved the stronger, we beg to be allowed to drop the subject, leaving the reader to draw his own inference, and at the same time begging his or her forgiveness. At a short distance from the ConAvay Falls are the Machno Falls, easily reached by a narrow path across the fields. Here a sort of narrow peninsula has been formed by the meeting of the Machno and the Conway at the bottom of a deep ravine in a secluded and picturesque spot. The cascade is pretty, but not equal in grandeur and beauty to that of the Falls of the Conway. Both, however, are very inferior to the really admirable Pandy Mill and Bridge. This mill is an old structure, by the side of the stream, in a secluded and shady glen. The thatched roof, the ivy-clad walls, the roughly hewn stones of which it is built, the large moss-groAvn wheel, and the general tumble-down appearance of the whole, give to Pandy Mill an exceedingly pic turesque aspect. With its lovely luxuriant background and its rich canopy of verdure it was destined to be a favourite subject for painters to reproduce, and it is every year portrayed by a number of artists and photographers, amateur and professional. Close by is the venerable old Roman bridge, whose arch has preserved its graceful curve, and is now in almost as perfect a condition as when the victorious legions of C\u00e6sar overran Britain. It has stood the test of ages, and may possibly outlive its rival, a few yards further, just as the old bridge of Ayr, according to Burns, the Scotch poet, will be a\" brig \" when the new bridge is reduced to a shapeless cairn. The Roman bridge, to which leads a path showing traces of the old Roman military road, is now overgrown with grass ; creeping plants are climbing up its arch, and falling on either side in graceful pendentives which reach the surface of the rippling waters. A circuitous path leads to the water's edge ; huge stones rising above the water enable one to get dry footed almost to the middle of the stream, and to see through the bridge, as in a frame, the winding bed of the river, under an arch of foliage of the richest colour. Taking advantage of the low condition of the river, there were on the big stepping stones half a dozen photographers, busy with lens and camera, taking views of the bridge and its lovely surroundings. Waterfalls are very pretty things, but they are very much like one another. Having seen Ceunant Mawr, the Swallow, Conway, and Machno Falls all within a few days, almost within a feAV hours, we began to get tired of foaming sheets of water leaping over ledges of rock into dark pools of stone, the sight of which was becoming monotonous. There remained to be seen another of the \"lions\" of Bettws-y-Coed, and that was the Fairy Glen, so we were informed by our driver, in whom we trusted implicitly. Was the Fairy Glen very far ? No, it was on the road to Bettws-y-Coed. The name was pretty, euphonious, and we were in hopes that the thing would prove as pleasant to the eye as its name to the ear. At the Machno Falls and Tandy Bridge there was no gate. It is true, an old gentle man, who, it appears, always happens to be passing that way when strangers are in view, did not fail to volunteer valuable information, in exchange for which we volunteered a small gratuity, but there was no compulsory payment. At the Fairy Glen, despite this poetical appellation, things are managed differently and in quite a business, matter-of-fact if-you-don't-like-it-go-elsewhere sort of way. There is a wicket gate to the entrance of"], [189, "BETTWS-Y-COED, CONWAY, LLANDUDNO. '5' the property on which the glen is situated, a steep path leading to a small booth, in which a toll collector, in the person of a young lady in a double-peaked cap, per emptorily demands the entrance fee from the visitors. Opposite the booth is a small wooden gate, above which, nailed to a tree, is a board with the following in scription painted on it : \" The Glen is closed on Sundays.\" This startling an nouncement certainly made a deep im pression on us, and the idea of closing a glen on Sundays struck us as particularly ingenious and liberal. We knew that Sunday was a day on which Londoners were deprived of their correspon dence, epicures of their crisp morn ing roll, travellers of railway trains, either partly or wholly, as at Llan- Iberis, a place which on the Sabbath is cut off from all the world ; we knew the shops were closed, but we had never before heard of a glen, Enjoying the Scenery"], [190, ""], [191, "THE FAIRY GLEN, BETTAVS-Y-COED"], [192, ""], [193, "BETTWS-Y-COED, CONWAY, LLANDUDNO. 153 board in question the artist might have had a tragic instead of a humorous drawing to prepare for this very chapter. On our way back to the gate where our fly was awaiting us, a large board (yet another !) caught the scribe's eye. It must have been a large one, and a conspicuous one, for the scribe is as blind as a bat ; at all events he is so painfully short-sighted that one day in London he mistook a soldier for a pillar-box, and Avas going to place a letter in the astonished warrior's breast pocket when he discovered his error. Well, on that board Avas painted in large letters an announcement to the effect that the keys of Ffos Noddyn could be had on application to a farm-house a little distance off. The scribe, always desirous to improve and add to his small stock of knowledge, at once made for the house, where a good lady Avho was hanging clothes on a line told him that Ffos Noddyn was simply the Welsh name of the Fairy Glen. There is reason to believe that the artist made fun of the scribe on his return from his self-appointed mission. At the entrance of the glen, or rather at the wicket gate on the road, there is a good woman, a lace-maker, who seems to be driving a pretty brisk trade. Lace not being one of the articles usually manufactured in Wales, we as a matter of course asked a few questions from the lace-maker, who it appears is the daughter of a Frenchwoman from Valenciennes, Avho settled in Wales long ago, and taught her lace-making. We certainly were surprised to find that a Frenchwoman had settled in this country, for very few French visitors seem as yet to have discovered Wales. We carefully scanned all the visitors' books in all the hotels we happened to stay in \u2014 a tolerably long list might be made of them \u2014 and French names were conspicuous by their almost complete absence, as there was not more than one or two every two or three pages, a ridiculously small proportion. Now why is this ? The explanation is undoubtedly to be found in the Arery indifferent accommodation and food provided for visitors in Welsh hotels. It is all very well to -say that the true lover of nature does not care for physical comfort, that the grandeur of the scenery, the beauties of the landscape are sufficient for him ; but this is sheer nonsense. A man or a woman \u2014 for ladies in this case are no exception \u2014 who has comfortable quarters and a good table is much more likely to enjoy the beauties and the sights of the surrounding country than one who has a cheerless apartment and bad food given, or rather very dearly sold, to him by a surly innkeeper. And this is unfortunately the case in most Welsh places. Let it not be supposed that Englishmen are in this respect less alive to the deficiencies of Wales as a place to spend a holiday than foreigners ; on the contrary, we found them loud in their complaints, and in not a few cases intensely disgusted with the treatment extended to them, which they resented in no small degree and grumbled at in no measured terms. Bettws-y-Coed is a delightful place, no doubt, but we had to leave it, though regret fully ; our regret, howeA*er, was tempered by the weather, which had become misty, damp, and boisterous. A dark pall of black clouds hung over the country ; the hills could hardly be seen through it, and the atmosphere, described by an American in the morning when the x"], [194, "SKETCHES OF ENGLAND. 154 clouds were gathering and the mist rising as \" smoky,\" had become in the late afternoon quite overpowering. The wind was blowing with terrific force, it was cold and piercing, and when we ensconced ourselves in a comfortable corner in a well-closed railway carriage, we felt grateful that we were in touch of the iron road again, and were not compelled to travel in an open conveyance, a mode of locomotion that a few days, nay, almost a few hours before seemed to us so pleasant and enjoyable. Circumstances, they say, alter cases, and so we thought, with a vengeance. In spite of its boasted advantages, coach travelling for all practical purposes is and must remain as dead as Queen Anne ; rivers do not flow up to their sources, progress moves onwards, and with all due deference to and respect for our ancestors, their modes of locomotion were all very well in their days, but they are utterly unsuited to the present time. We may possibly be more fastidious, more difficult to please ; neverthe less we are, as far as locomotion goes, much better off than our forefathers. Such were our reflections, very different, it will be obserA'ed, to those we made a few days before, when traArelling through the Pass of Llanberis ; but it was fine then, the weather was mild, the sun bright, and noAV it Avas cold and bleak and dark and misty ; the birds had taken refuge in the trees and rocks, the clouds were being driven about by the approaching storm, and we Avere hurrying as rapidly as steam could propel us along from Bettws-y-Coed on to the sea board again. Like Mr. Sam Weller's knowledge of London, Llandudno is peculiar, but, unlike that gentleman's acquaintance with the metropolis, it is not extensive. Its peculiarity consists in its position, for it lies between two bays. The guide-books are fond of describing this as an unusual advantage, but to the untutored mind it is more likely to appear as an unmitigated nuisance. Everybody knoAvs, or ought to know (by-the-bye what a lot of things one ought to know and does not), that Llandudno stands between the two massive promontories, each formed of a gigantic rock, called Great Orme's Head and Little Orme's Head, at the narrowest point of the peninsula which separates the Bay of Beaumaris from Orme's Bay. Like many other watering places in England and on the Continent which have sprung up, mushroom fashion, in a very short time, it is of modern growth, and did not exist some thirty years ago, except as a little fishing Adllage to be found only on the most accurate maps. It is said that it was discovered by Mr. John Bright, and that Llandudno owes its prosperity to the great political orator, just as Cannes was brought under the notice of the world and made a famous winter resort by Lord Brougham. English statesmen have a knack of pitching their tents, figuratively speaking, in the most picturesque and pleasantest spots in order to recoup themselves after the arduous duties and fatigue of the English parliamentary season. Llandudno is built on a circular bay extending from Great Orme's Head to Little Orme's Head, the town itself being adjacent to and sheltered by the former rock, which affords excellent protection against the north winds. The good substantial houses, the fine wide streets, denote the recent origin of the place, and its highly plutocratic and essentially respectable and proper character. There are no old nooks and corners in Llandudno, no old hotels or taverns ; there is not, we think, in the whole place a single public-house, or, if there"], [195, "BETTWS-Y-COED, CONWAY, LLANDUDNO. 155 be one, how carefully it has been concealed from public gaze ! And how very rude of us to allude to such a place as a p Well, the fact is one is so much accustomed to see those establishments flourishing at street corners, even in the most aristocratic quarters of English towns, that we may be excused for noticing that at Llandudno they are conspicuous by their absence. Everything at Llandudno appears to be brand-new, so new indeed that the town is not yet built, except that portion of it which is situated near the beach, that is to say, the beach which is on the Orme's Bay shore. A fine Parade, crescent-shaped, lined with stately private houses and hotels, runs parallel with and follows the sweep of the bay. It is separated from the foreshore by a wide carriage way and a promenade for foot passengers, on which a band stand has been erected. Other streets, at right angles with the Parade, run in the direction of the Conway shore, Avhilst Mostyn Street, the Bond Street of the place, is parallel to the Parade. There are the best shops, some of which are really very fine, and seem to be very prosperous. Beyond Llandudno. Mostyn Street runs another street, to all appearances inhabited by the local population, small tradesmen, clerks, railway-men, and others, who eke out their living by letting apart ments to visitors during the season. The other quarter of the toAvn, which is destined one day to extend from one shore to the other, a distance of something under a mile, is as yet nothing but fields, through which roads have been mapped out at right angles with each other, on the most approved American anti-picturesque pattern. Ultimately it is expected that houses will cover the whole of this ground, Avhich has for the present a very Sahara-like aspect. The people of Llandudno have a very harmless mania which consists in bestowing upon their houses the most high-sounding names, although every house in the place is numbered. Every Englishman rejoices in the thought that his house is his castle, and in this respect the Welsh seem to be more English than the English themselves. The practice of giving names to houses in the country or in places where there are few dwelling houses is intelligible x 2"], [196, "SKETCHES OF ENGLAND. 156 and indeed indispensable, in order to enable visitors and postmen to distinguish one house from another. But why people should insist upon dubbing their abode Elm Villa, Stuckup Lodge, Gushing Cottage, or Bumptious House when they live in a street every house in which has its number, is a mystery to any one not gifted with extraordinary powers of com prehension. Again, why should they thus compel their friends and creditors, when writing to them or sending in their bills, to take the trouble of writing such long addresses, one half of Avhich is surplusage, perfectly useless, and the only object of which is to gratify the petty pride of the residents who delight in reading, on the envelopes containing a demand from their tradesmen for the settlement of long outstanding accounts, something in this style : \u2014 U. P. Hardup, Esq., Swagger Lodge, 764, Dunning Street. As an example of the length to which this kind of thing is carried in Llandudno, we saw in a back street a small cottage with one storey only above the ground floor, on the door of which could be read immediately above the number the name Wynnstay House, which, it is well known, is the name of the seat of the richest man in Wales, Sir Watkin Williams Wynn, also called the King of Wales. Could anything be more ridiculous ? And this is only one example out of many. There is no vegetation at Llandudno or in the immediate neighbourhood ; not a tree, not a shrub, hardly a blade of grass is to be seen, and in summer during the bathing season the place must be unbearably hot and oppressive. In September it is unpleasant enough when the sun is shedding its rays over this rocky promontory, for there is no shade, not even so much as would shelter Sarah Bernhardt herself. Perhaps this, however is an exaggeration, as there are two flagstaffs on the parade. This is a great drawback, but it is questionable whether the terrific wind which seems to be always sweeping OArer Llandudno is not the greater of the two. And this is how the fact that it has two bays, which is supposed to be an ad\\rantage, as people can bathe on one shore or on the other according to the state of the weather, appears to us to be a very objectionable feature. Llandudno is built on a narrow neck or strip of land, with a bay on each side, looking Orme's Bay to the east, and Conway Bay to the west, and if it is sheltered to the north-west and the south-east, it is exposed to the full force of the westerly and north-easterly winds. So that when the wind blows over one of the bays it reaches the other at the same time, the only difference to the bathers being that they have the wind in their face or in their back, but that they have it there can be no doubt. This we found by experience to be the case when going to the Conway shore. As to bathing on both shores, that seems a sort of Utopian dream, because the town drains in the Bay cf Conway, as every one can see at low water. At present bathing is confined to the Orme's Bay shore, and is likely to remain so for a long time. The propriety of Llandudno is something marvellous, the ladies' bathing place being situated at about half a mile from the place where gentlemen are allowed to disport themselves in the briny. But that even is not"], [197, "BETTWS-Y-COED, CONWAY, LLANDUDNO. 157 enough to satisfy the extraordinary sense of propriety of the town council, for conspicuous boards are placed on the promenade on which the following notice is \" writ large \" : \" Gentlemen are respectfully requested.to keep off the beach and foreshore on this ground during the time that ladies are bathing.\" Why not at once respectfully request gentlemen to keep indoors as long as a solitary member of the fair sex is in the Avater ? It is to be feared we shamelessly refused to comply with the request of the Llandudno town councillors, even though a solitary lady bather was courageous enough to bathe in spite of the rough sea a Sketching Party. and the boisterous weather then preArailing; in fact we think we can recollect that one of our party levelled his glass at that intrepid woman, in the hope of being able to discern the features of one so bold and so impervious to cold. But how very inconsistent of the Llandudno town councillors ! Whilst they request gentle men not to go near the ladies' bathing places, no such restrictions are imposed on ladies who may wish to see the lords of creation playing the part of Tritons in Orme's Bay. Now that is very unfair, and one cannot account for the injustice unless \u2014 horrible thought ! \u2014 the ladies at Llandudno have so little in common with the Venus of Milo that they"], [198, "SKETCHES OF ENGLAND- 158 object to being looked at. If it is not so, then the Llandudno toAvn councillors are libelling wholesale the fair sex frequenting their place, and they should lose no time in giving an explanation. The world is breathlessly awaiting a word from Llandudno. But the Llandudno councillors deserve unstinted praise for having prohibited bicycles and velocipedes on their Parade. A regulation of this kind is Avanted in many places besides Llandudno, for the two-wheeled and three-wheeled abomination is getting more and more objectionable, and is one ofthe chief dangers to foot passengers in large English toAvns. As we have said before, the place is decidedly slow, plutocratic, and stuck up ; the visitors who frequent it have a cold, repellent, how-dare-you-look-at-me sort of air which is anything but refreshing ; they walk with a dignified mien, like the jackdaw of Rheims after being excommunicated, and are equally untalkative, not only to strangers but among themselves ; they seem to have exhausted their stock of remarks and to have nothing more to say. At meal times, the temperature of the dining-room went down three degrees as soon as the guests assembled, and for this reason the artist, who hates cold, used to insist on having his meals before or after the other people who lived in the hotel. As a matter of course amusements are few at Llandudno ; there is a concert hall where performances are given in the evening, and during the day the iron pier is the rendezvous of the local rank, fashion, and beauty. The pier itself is a very light structure, so light as to make one wonder how it can resist the furious onslaught of the raging waves of the Irish Sea. There is fortunately a shelter at the pier-head, Avithout which no one could stand there for five minutes in weather such as we had. Not that it was rainy or misty, but the wind was tremendously high, and so violent was its force that the Liverpool boat could not land its passengers, and had to go on to Beaumaris without stopping. The attractions of the pier are soon exhausted, and are of little interest to the children who form an important part ofthe floating population, if we may be alloAved so to call the visitors, to whom, as they are as frequently in the water as out of it, the term may be appropriately applied. For the youngsters, there are the usual Punch and Judy shows, acrobats, and nigger minstrels to be found in all sea-bathing toAvns. But the peculiarity of Llandudno is that instead of giving their performances on the sands, the itinerant artists have established themselves on one of the slopes of Great Orme's Head, not far from the pier, and there in a hollow forming a kind of natural circus or arena, sheltered from the wind but not from the sun, boys and girls attended by their nurses and servants meet in the afternoon and enjoy the thrilling episodes in the Use of Mr. Punch, the feats of the gymnasts, and the ditties and comic songs ofthe niggers. On account of its position at the extreme end of a peninsula Llandudno is not a convenient spot from which excursions can be made, as it involves travelling repeatedly over the same ground, the road being the same for a considerable distance whatever the tourist's destination may happen to be. Conway Castle is one of the sights in the neighbourhood, and the only one Avithin easy distance. The favourite drive is round Great Orme's Head, along a very fine carriage road cut in the rock, on a sort of ledge having on one side the tall cliffs, on the other the sea. At the"], [199, "BETTWS-Y-COED, CONWAY, LLANDUDNO. 159 entrance to this road there is a tall house, an ugly Gothic building, where tickets are bought, to be given up on leaving the drive at the other end. The view of the Irish Sea from all parts of the road is very beautiful, and from the height above the town there is a bird's-eye view of the two bays and of Llandudno, the latter a most unpicturesque object with its blocks of slate-roofed houses separated by streets running at right angles, the whole having the appearance of an overgrown chess-board."], [200, "CHAPTER XIII. LLANGOLLEN, BARMOUTH, AND CARNARVON. E reached Llangollen one afternoon at five o'clock. From the station the first thing that Ave saAV Avas the Dee, rushing on a bed of rocks, over which its waters noisily dashed and foamed, before disappearing under the four arches of a fine old bridge, dating from tho fourteenth century and formed of four arches, three of which are pointed, whilst the fourth, that nearest to the town, is almost perfectly circular. Whether it was originally pointed and has assumed its present shape through some subsidence of the soil, is a question to which no satisfactory answer could be vouchsafed by the natives of Avhom avc inquired, and one which avc had no time to elucidate. As it is, the bridge is a very picturesque structure, and one of the features of Llangollen, a town which by itself is far from being an ornament to the lovely valley named after it. Llangollen is situated in a narrow vale, in the midst of Avhich runs the Dee, and enclosed by hills of moderate height, sometimes described as mountains by people who are carried away by their enthusiasm for the beauties of nature. It is a small place, with a popula tion of nearly 5,000 inhabitants, living in old and dilapidated houses, with slate roofs, forming irregular streets, narrow and not remarkable for cleanliness. Doctors, it is well knoAvn, do not always agree, nor do the authors of the guide-books with which we duly armed ourselves on setting out ; for whilst the red-book of the artist speaks of Llangollen as busy and well-to-do, the green-book of the scribe, by a stretch of imagination, describes it as lively. In this particular case the red-book has certainly the advantage over the green, for Llangollen is decidedly not b/vely, however busy and well-to-do it may be. There was really no need for bestowing on Llangollen the epithet lively, for one does not visit a small place in a mountainous region for the sake of its liveliness or animation ; on the contrary, such places are resorted to on account of their climate, natural beauties, quiet and solitude, and in this respect Llangollen leaves nothing to be desired, even by tbe most captious critic. At Llangollen began our acquaintance with Welsh hotels. If short reckonings make long friends, the inns of Wales must enjoy the everlasting friendship of numberless people, for the greatest and most ardent wish of the tourist in Cambria is to settle his account as quickly as possible \u2014 and go. Alphonse Karr, speaking of the varied assortment of govern ments which have in turn ruled over France, said : \"Plus 9a change, plus c'est la meme chose.\" That is exactly the case with Welsh hotels, which are all equally bad. On our arrival we were ushered to our apartments through a labyrinth of corridors radiating from a common centre, and leading in all directions in general and nowhere in"], [201, "LLANGOLLEN, BARMOUTH, AND CARNARVON. 161 particular. Certainly the corridor one followed never seemed to take one to one's sleeping apartment, but nearly always to somebody else's, who, as one touched the door handle\" gruffly, or sometimes softly, exclaimed, \"Who's there?.\" Upon which, looking at the number on the door, one hastily withdrew, to wander at random through the maze so cleverly planned by a local architect. This kind of amusement is not devoid of some charms, but it is apt after a time to seem monotonous to anyone who is not a born explorer, a Stanley or a Brazza. Yet it must be admitted that little incidents of this kind are rather pleasant than otherwise in modern travelling, which has become a very commonplace affair after all. In spite of the sun, Avhich shone brilliantly, we found the wind chilly and the air keen, when making our customary reconnaissance in the village. To our great soitoav, the national costume has completely disappeared from Wales\u2014 certainly from Xorth Wales. The women do not wear the conical hat we are accustomed to see in pictures representing or pretending A Grinding Mill. to represent Welsh women. It is true it is said that in Cardiganshire there are still to be seen Avomen wearing the national dress, but for the statement which we were unable to verify avc are not to be held answerable. In Llangollen the only approach to national peculiarity in dress is that the women nearly all Avear men's hats over their linen caps. This is peculiar but not pretty. On going round the village the surrounding hills presented a very fine sight under the last rays of the setting sun which flooded their serrated summits with diffused golden light, by the side of which the deep tones of the grass were remarkable for their intensity. The sky above Avas blue, and here and there a few white flaky clouds, rapidly driven by the wind, flew over the range of hills, their shadows being reflected on the slopes with pretty effects of alternate light and shade. v"], [202, "SKETCHES OF ENGLAND. 162 The hotel was separated from the Dee only by the road, beyond which a little garden sloped down to the water's edge. The river is very shallow just at this place, and its waters are of a very unpleasant yellowish colour, due, no doubt, to the sandstone through which they run : however, it appears that trout fishing can be enjoyed on its banks in the season. Whether the Llangollen people drain into the Dee or not we cannot tell, but the smell rising from the stream is particularly offensive. As we had been told to be in at a certain time to dinner, avc returned at what avc believed to be the appointed hour; but it turned out that avc Avere a few minutes late, and, in the large dining-room, Avith sunk ceiling, we found twelve very solemn looking persons seated at the centre table. A neat waitress directed us to a small side table, Avhere we could survey all our fellow-travellers without attracting their attention. The ladies had dressed for dinner, that is, they all wore elaborately trimmed silk dresses, with a superabundance of frills, sashes, laces, ribbons, flowers, and ornaments of all kinds ; the gentlemen had, as a matter of course, assumed the regulation black coat. This cere monious etiquette in a small place such as Llangollen someAvhat surprised the artist ; but Avhat staggered him fairly was the silence which reigned in the room. Not a sound Avas heard, not a voice Avas raised beyond a Avhisper \u2014 that is when any one spoke, Avhich Avas not often. Laughing, it is needless to say, Avas out of the question, and the serious countenances of the guests so strongly impressed the artist, that he inquired of the Avaitress if any one was ill or had died iu the house. On receiving a negative reply, he declared that something must have happened, as it was not possible for people to look so Avretchedly miserable unless there Avas some cause for it. Suddenly silence AATas happily broken by the Welsh harpist stationed in the entrance hall, Avho played a number of Welsh airs, such as \"Jenny Jones,\" the \"March of the Men of Harlech,\" \" Ar hyd y nos,\" and, after having exhausted his stock of national melodies, wound up the performance with \" Bonnie Dundee,\" and \" The Campbells are coming.\" This local artist, by name Jones, walks on crutches, and is designated as the lame AVelsh harpist. He is a talkative, obliging man, from wbom a good deal of information can be obtained about the country, with every inch of which he seems to be well acquainted. At every meal \u2014 breakfast, lunch, and dinner \u2014 he comes in and enlivens the monotonous hotel life with his national melodies, which he plays with much taste on a real Welsh harp, that is an instrument having no pedals, but furnished with three rows of strings, the middle row being for the half notes. A printed notice, curiously worded, hangs on the wall of the hall : it is to the effect that the harpist \" begs to inform the respective parties visiting this place, that he has nothing to depend upon but the subscriptions of those who may favour him with their patronage.\" Let us hope that the lame Welsh harpist is as well and liberally patronised as he deserves to be. Having had a chat Avith the harpist after dinner, Ave proceeded to the drawing-room, where the majority of the guests had repaired ; but there again the sight of ten or a dozen people in an immense apartment, seated as far as possible from one another, and engaged in reading, like so many school- boys or girls learning their lessons, was so depressing that Ave"], [203, "LLANGOLLEN, BARMOUTH, AND CARNARVON. 163 rushed out and into the street. But the bitterly cold wind soon drove us in again, and we were fain to take refuge in the smoking-room, where we blazed away a fabulous number of cigarettes, occasionally sipping Scotch whisky and soda-water, to which the artist took very kindly from the first. And so ended our first evening at Llangollen. With the daylight a very beautiful view could be had from the windows of our hotel. Immediately in front of us was the Dec, merrily running between its wooded banks, beyond extended the valley with its fine trees in full leaf, waving their foliage under the breath of a gentle breeze, and in the background rose the tall slate hill, crowned by the ruins of the Castle of Dinas Bran or Crow's Castle. This fortress, now a shapeless mass of stones, but picturesque enough when seen at a distance, has no historical interest attaching to it. A In the Reading Room, Llangollen. local legend has it that it AAras once the residence of a ATery beautiful lady deeply in love Avith a bard who, as is the wTont of bards in all countries,, wooed her in poetry, some pieces of which, it appears, are still extant, in Welsh language, of course. We cannot quote the effusions of the Cambrian bard, for we have no knowledge of them ; but we are able to gratify the curiosity of our lady readers as regards the bard himself, who rejoiced in the name of Hoel ap Einion Llygliw ; we can confidentially tell our gentlemen readers that the lady was called Myfanwy Fechan, a very pretty name, and euphonious, it seems, from a Welsh point of view, but on this we can offer no opinion. As we have already stated, the hills that encircle the vale of Llangollen cannot properly be termed mountains ; and, indeed, the heights in this region are only the spurs and buttresses as it Avere of the real Welsh mountains. Owing in a great measure to the misuse Y 2"], [204, "SKETCHES OF ENGLAND. 164 of the word mountain as applied to such hills, the first impression is one rather of dis appointment than otherwise, despite the beauties of the landscape. But if one expects grander scenery, on the other hand nothing can be prettier than the vale of Llangollen, which, in that respect, fulfils the most sanguine expectation. The great drawback of the place is, to express it in the artist's oavu words, that it is all foreground, and that there is an absence of background to this very pretty picture. The valley, being narrow, is squeezed in between two walls of hills, beyond which no other chain of heights is visible, the result being a A^ery limited perspective. The first thing we saw in our morning walk was the church, dedicated to a saint whose name would materially increase the cost of a sixpenny telegram. Here it is\u2014 Collen ap Gwynog ap Clyddwg ap Cowrda ap Caradoc Freichfras ap Llyr Merini ap Einion Yrth ap Cunedda Wledig. We give it in full, as it is the only curious or interesting thing about this monument. In the churchyard is the tomb, marked by a three-sided pillar, of the \"Ladies of Llangollen,\" and their faithful servant. These ladies of Llangollen Avere two Irish maiden ladies \u2014 Lady Eleanor Butler and Miss Ponsonby \u2014 who, in 1779, came over from Ireland and settled at Llangollen, where they lived in seclusion for OATer fifty years. Their object in leaving their friends was to avoid opportunities of matrimonial alliance, and to gratify an extraordinary desire to retire from the world. United by a romantic attachment Avhich Avas the more remarkable on account of the difference of their ages, Lady Butler being considerably her friend's senior, they lived in perfect harmony in their residence of Plas Newydd for half a century. They, nevertheless, kept up an active correspondence Avith their friends in Ireland and in England, who kept them Avell posted up in the world's eArents and the small talk and gossip of London and Dublin society. The two ladies were, as may lie supposed, of very eccentric habits, and carried their eccentricity so far as tu adopt, as their ordinary dress, the Welsh costume in all its purity, even tu tlie tall hat. A very good idea of them may be formed from the portrait drawn from life by a lady friend, and reproduced in engravings, lithographs, and photographs to be found throughout the length and breadth of North Wales. This portrait represents the two ladies in the latter part of their life. They are sitting at a table and wear a semi-masculine costume in perfect keeping with their grey curly hair, cut short, and the ribbon Avith a sort of decoration attached to it hanging from the neck of one of them. Their appearance is not by any means prepossessing, and is even grotesque, as is indeed that of all women who, by their costume or occupation, unsex themselves ; they look like overgro*wn and prematurely aged chubby schoolboys. The result of their eccentric and useless existence has been to secure for them an undeserved and unintelligible notoriety, but Avhich the natives of Llangollen turn to excellent account. A brisk trade is done in photographs and biographies of the \" Ladies of Llangollen,\" and their former residence, Plas NeAvydd, is the lion of the place. Plas NeAvydd is situated on an eminence behind the town. It is a cottage of irregular plan, having only one story above the ground-floor ; the lower part of the outer walls is hidden by a number of carved panels of black oak of different styles, periods, and origin"], [205, "LLANGOLLEN, BARMOUTH, AND CARNARVON. 165 brought from various places, and put together in curious confusion. Some of the Avood carvings are of great artistic merit, having been taken from old churches and antique furni ture, for in the medley of decorative panels portions of old sideboards or bedsteads are in juxtaposition with fragments of rercdos, organ screens, or church doors. The cottage stands in a garden fenced in by iron chains connecting carved oaken posts, and is entered through an elaborately carved porch of Japanese design. An old lady takes the visitors over the house, the rooms of which are very small and Ioav. The door and window-frames, as well as the mantel-piece, display the same carved oak decoration Avhich prevails inside and outside. On the tables, and on every available piece of furniture, are an extraordinary quantity of curios, antique or modern, Oriental or European, spurious or authentic, placed at random, and without any attempt at classification. The present OAvner of Plas Newydd cultivates a taste for ivory carving, and his productions occupy a conspicuous place in the show. We have a lively recollection of an ivory representing a lady in a voluminous crinoline, armed with a bow and arrow, and taking aim at some imaginary object, the Avhole beiug designated \" A Fair Toxophilite.\" Every room in the house contains curiosities of some kind, and even the staircase is crammed with knicknacks of all sorts. On account of its quaintness, Plas NeAvydd is well worthy a visit, but the artist, or collector, or simple man of taste Avill not find there anything to attract his attention. Before Ave have done wdth the \" Ladies of Llangollen,\" let us add that Lady E. Butler died in 1829 at the age of ninety, and Miss Ponsonby in 1830, aged seventy-eight. A large placard posted in the hall of the hotel intimated to the \" respective parties visiting this place,\" as our friend the Welsh harpist had it, that \" magnificent pleasure boats,\" starting from a place duly specified, at certain times Avent to the Chain Bridge and the Horse-shoe Fails, giving to tourists an opportunity of visiting Valle Crucis Abbey, and returning to Llangollen at stated hours, the fare there and back being fixed at the ridiculously Ioav price of 6d. or 9d. As no boat could possibly go on the Dee, we inquired where was the canal ; and we set out in the hope of embarking on board the \" magnificent pleasure-boat,\" at the same time Avondering what the Welsh Horse-shoe Falls were, and whether they had anything except their name to recall the famous American waterfall. We arrived on the banks of the canal before the appointed time, and as there was no boat to be seen, and no one to give us any information, we at once decided to walk to the Abbey and to return by boat, FolloAving the canal towing-path, we had the Dee on our left, merrily running on its rocky bed, between deep-wooded banks, and contrasting with the stillness of the artificial and appropriately named silent highway. Beyond the Dee rose the hills, clothed in verdure, which bounded the landscape, whilst on the other side a low ridge concealed from view the Bronfawr, at the foot of wdiich is situated Valle Crucis Abbey, and whose summit only could be distinguished. Once or twice we met natives, of whom we tried to ascertain whether we were on the right road; but they did not know or did not understand our question, for they appeared"], [206, "166 SKETCHES OF ENGLAND. not to know English, although they could ask for a penny in exchange for the information which they did not give. However, we reached the Abbey without further trouble than walking for half a mile in the wrong direction, which involved retracing our steps ; but as the weather was fine and scenery lovely, we enjoyed the contretemps immensely. Crossing a field or two, the western front of the church was disclosed to our view, consisting of a pointed doorway, above Avhich are three lancet windows surmounted by a Avheel window. The door was closed, but a tug at the bell soon brought an attendant, who admitted us and acted as our guide, philosopher, and friend. The church must hirve been a rather small one, as far as can be judged from the ruined Avails and broken pillars, the plan of Avhich is marked by heaps of fragments curiously arranged. It consisted of a nave and two small chapels, one on each side of the choir. In fact it Avas exactly in the shape of a cross. Of the roof and tower nothing is left, and the walls are in a most lamentable state. Some interesting carved and inscribed tombstones, however, are tolerably preserved, the ornamentation being still distinguishable as well as some of the letters and dates. In ansAver to an inquiry from one of our party as to who Avas the knight Avhose effigy we were examining, the guide, with a sly look, gave him the name, an essentially Welsh one, wholly unpronounceable, which Adsibly staggered our friend and provoked our laughter, in Avhich he good-humouredly joined. But this reply seemed to have thoroughly satisfied him, for he did not ask for any more names. The Chapter-house, a stone vaulted structure, still remains, and after having been long used as a farmhouse, is now uninhabited ; there is in it a finely carved mantel-piece made of a Norman tombstone. The most picturesque view of the ruins is to be had from the side of a fish-pond at the back of the Abbey, whose walls are reflected in the mirror-like water with excellent effect, as evidenced by the number of drawings, paintings, and photographs taken from that spot. In the garden behind there is a spring of brackish water called the Wishing Well, of which every visitor is expected to drink a cupful. In our case this expectation was not realised, as we have a decided objection to drinking water filtered through a churchyard. About a quarter of a mile beyond the Abbey is a shaft, about seven feet high, called Eliseg's Pillar, because it was erected in the ninth century by Cyngen to the memory of Eliseg, father of Brochmael, Prince of PoAvys. Originally the pillar was twelve feet high, but it was thrown doA\\rn during the rebellion, and an inscription records that it was replaced in its present position by Mr. Lloyd, of Trevor Hall, in 1779, that is to say, in the same year that the two eccentric maiden ladies of Plas Newydd came to Llangollen. There remained to be seen the famous Horse-shoe Falls and the Chain Bridge. We accordingly returned in the direction of the canal, where, near a roadside inn, was a small boat, about fifteen feet long, on board of which were two small boys, the elder of whom was about twelve years old, the other being two years his junior. To our inquiry they replied that theirs was the \" magnificent pleasure-boat\" we had read of at the hotel, and that they were going to start for Llangollen as soon as the \" missus \" returned, at the same time point ing to the \" missus,\" who was standing near the inn a few yards off. From the good lady"], [207, "LLANGOLLEN, BARMOUTH, AND CARNARVON. 167 we obtained the assurance that we had plenty of time to see the falls and the bridge before the departure of the boat. It is painful to have to record our sad disappointment on finding that the Horse-shoe Falls were only the result of the erection of a dam or weir on the Dee, and that the Chain Bridge was a little iron bridge like those in use on the stations of the Metro politan Railway to pass from one side to the other ! We at once returned and embarked on board the \" magnificent pleasure-boat,\" the crew consisting of the \" missus\" as captain, of the elder boy as helmsman, and of the smaller boy as signalman and steam whistle. The whistle was replaced by a bugle, and the steam by the lusty lungs of the young urchin, who managed to make a deafening noise with his brass instrument. We were propelled along by the exertion of a small, black, shaggy pony, and we arrived at Llangollen without any mishap, although we very nearly decapitated with our toAV-rope a lady who was rowing a small boat on the canal. And now we had seen all the lions of Llangollen ; we had \" done \" the place as thoroughly as the limited time at our disposal would allow, and nothing remained but for us to resume our journey onwards. But before Ave left we were invited to put down our names in the visitors' book according to the general custom. A curious institution that visitors' book ! Already at Dover we had noticed some very amusing entries ; the most comic of which was furnished by a Belgian gentleman, wdio styled himself Candidas notaire ; but here, in the midst of Wales, some of the effusions recorded by passing tourists capped everything avc had seen before. The attempts at wit, humour, philosophy, poetry \u2014 for some travellers cannot refrain from expressing their impressions in gushing lines in Avhich rhyme is very hard up and reason conspicuous by its absence \u2014 were for the greater part most ludicrous. Sometimes even the entries were absolutely offensive. The following is a specimen of the would-be-AAritty order. A party of a dozen visitors had signed their names and bracketed them with the mention, \"The happy family.\" So far, good. The Avitty man, hoAvever, was at hand, and in pencil had written this query, \" All of the same Pa and Ma ? \" The avenging gods could not let such an offence go unpunished ; and if the inquisitive tourist who wrote the above query has not had an opportunity of Arisiting Llangollen since scribbling his pretty remark, we can inform him that a third visitor's opinion of the witty man's conceit has been expressed in the following terse sentence, for the accuracy of which we can vouch, \" What a jackass ! \" The country to the west of Llangollen through which the raihvay passes on its way to Corwen, Dolgelly, and Barmouth, to which last-mentioned place we were bound, is much prettier than that which lies on the other side. The Dee winds its Avay between finely wooded banks and lovely green meadows, beyond which, on both sides, rise verdant or rugged heights, whose undulating summits stand out sharply against a second and higher range of hills faintly outlined in the distance. The serrated bluish tops of the farthest mountains seem at times to blend with the azure of the sky and form a splendid background to the picturesque and ever-changing landscape. The contrast between the dark green verdure, the grey boulders^ and the soft and hazy sky is one of the greatest charms of this Welsh scenery. As the valley expands, in the vicinity of Corwen, the aspect of the country"], [208, "SKETCHES OF ENGLAND. 168 changes and becomes less pleasant, but it soon assumes a more charming appearance as Bala is approached. The line skirts the lake whose waters lave the embankment on which the railway is carried, and a splendid view is obtained of this beautiful sheet of water, through Avhich it is said the Dee passes, as does the Rhone through the Leman, without mixing its Avaters Avith those of the lake. After leaAdng Bala Lake the scenery becomes wilder, rugged hills rising on all sides in successive gradation. Dolgelly we passed when the shades of night were already limiting the range of vision to the immediate surroundings, and soon Ave reached the wide estuary of the Mawddach, reached through a desert of sand and crossed by a long viaduct, at the end of which lies Barmouth. As it may be asked why we did not stop at Dolgelly and ascend Cader Idris, Ave may as Avell say at once that we had determined to go up Snowdon, the monarch of Welsh \u2014 and English \u2014 mountains, and that avc thought it unnecessary to see the second best when avc had seen the best. On our arrival at Barmouth avc were taken charge of by the tout of a hotel with an unpronounceable name and driven to tlie house, where i I to alight just at dinner time. This circumstance might, in other places, hav< ntageous, but not so at Barmouth, for having deposited our luggage in the enl c hall, the tout vanished and left us to shift for ourselves as best avc could. There was no r- to receive us, and avc might as Avell have been landed in the street. The waiters and at i n-dants, male and female, turned a deaf ear to our desperate entreaties, and an earnest appeal to a young lady Avith a remarkably curly head of golden hair had no better result. After three- quarters of an hour of fuming and fretting and, regretfully be it said, of using bad language on the part of at least one of our party, a very antiquated Welsh servant came to look at our luggage, Avhich she reasonably enough found too heavy for her to carry upstairs, and she Avent her Avay, taking, hoAvever, some rugs and coats, which she considerately distributed among various rooms, and for Avhich a chase had to be organized later on. But this is anticipating. At last we were shown upstairs and our luggage followed \u2014 not immediately, be it well understood, but in sufficient time to enable us to sit down to dinner some two hours after our arrival at the Hotel. After dinner we went out to have a look round, and walked in the direction of the river, and thence to the water's edge. The night was very cold, but not a cloud Avas to be seen on the starry sky; the moon shone brightly, shedding its pale rays on the broad MaAvddach studded with small boats, which looked like flies on a sheet of silver. To the right, on the other side of the estuary, barred by the black line of the viaduct, a chain of hills with vaguely outlined summits stood out, a vaporous mass on the luminous heaven, whilst by a marked contrast the tall sombre mountain, to the flanks of Avhich clung the houses of the town, rose like a colossal granite Avail. On the darkness of this mountain the white houses were dimly seen rising in rows, and here and there a gas-lamp or a lighted Avindow made a luminous spot like a glow-worm in a thick bush. Barmouth is in an admirable situation at the mouth of the river Mawddach, on a narroAV strip of land between the Llawllech hills and the sea. A part of the town is actually on the hill, its houses clustering in tiers on the slopes of the slaty heights which shelter it from the"], [209, "LLANGOLLEN, BARMOUTH, AND CARNARVON. 169 north-easterly winds. A long street, running parallel to the beach, practically forms the new town, the houses in which are very plain and commonplace. The shops are of a some what inferior order, and the general appearance of the place does not call for any remark, as it offers no peculiarity of any kind. The railway line passes between the town and the beach on a level Avith the roadway. This arrangement is rather objectionable, as there is no means of getting to the sands except by way of the railway bridge adjoining the station. The consequence is that one has to make a long detour or run the risk of being run over by the Off Baemouth. Out foe a Row passing trains, besides incurring all sorts of fines and penalties, duly notified in a number of notice-boards to be found all along the line, informing the tourist that all trespassers will be prosecuted. The beach is extensive and formed of very fine sand, sloping gently towards the sea. Bathing can be enjoyed there with the greatest facility, except in the vicinity of the station, which is considered a somewhat dangerous place. As a matter of course, there is a special portion of the beach set apart for ladies and gentlemen respectively, as it is considered z"], [210, "SKETCHES OF ENGLAND. 170 most improper in England, including the Principality of Wales, for people of different sexes to bathe within a considerable distance of each other. This distance varies according to the localities, and depends on the degree of prudishness from which the town councillors suffer. In some cases the worthy burgesses have only a mild attack, in others the disease sets in Avith great severity. We cannot say what is, in this respect, the condition of the Barmouth local authorities, as when we were there it was so cold that no one dared venture in the water. Walking on Barmouth Sands is no easy matter, as the foot sinks at every step, and when the wind blows, the fine sand fills the air through Avhich it is wafted, getting into the mouth, ears, and eyes in the most uncomfortable and painful manner. They say that at Barmouth sand is to be found even in eggs. It is not quite so bad as that, but very nearly, for the slightest breeze raises clouds of sand, which is carried into the street and the houses. The hills behind the town afford very commanding views of the environs. The way to the summit lies through a very steep zigzag path cut in the rock, and rather unpleasant to Avalk upon. As we ascended, the atmosphere being clear, the toAvn, the bay, and the hills at each extremity stood out in relief as on a raised plan with wonderful distinctness. On the other side the Avide valley of the MaAvddach, enclosed within a double Avail of rocky heights, could be seen for a long distance, the silvery river winding its way betAveen the tall hills and joining the sea after passing under the long railway viaduct, now a narrow, straight black line on the dazzling water shining like burnished metal under the rays of the morning sun. Beyond that could be perceived the bluish summit of the chain of mountains of which Cader Idris is the culminating point, Wishing to obtain a more extended Auew we continued our ascent, climbing over the rocks and those curious dry stone walls which are a feature in all Welsh landscapes, but unfortunately one of the sudden mists so frequent in this country had set in, and Cader Idris and the chain of mountains it commands, as well as the hills which enclose the bay of Barmouth, had vanished from sight. This is one of the great draAvbacks of Wales, where it is well-nigh impossible to rely on the weather, or rather on the atmosphere, Avhich in one instant from clear and bright changes to mist and sometimes almost complete darkness. Resuming our wanderings we soon came to a spot where a number of young ladies were engaged in sketching a farmhouse in a picturesque situation. We often came across similar scenes ; for there are what may be termed classical places, which eArery lady visitor or tourist who is able to wield the brush or pencil feels it incumbent upon her to draw or paint to the best of her abilities, and these, in many cases, are of no mean order. English ladies and young girls are, as a rule, very proficient in drawing and sketching in water-colours, as the prospectuses of boarding-schools elegantly express it, and there is hardly a well-to-do English home where the drawing-room walls do not bear testimony to the artistic skill of the mistress of the house or her daughters. Besides these amateurs, there was a good sprinkling of professional lady artists, easily distinguished by their peculiar \u00e6sthetic dress their assiduity, and their greater dexterity in handling the brush ; their general appearance"], [211, "LLANGOLLEN, BARMOUTH, AND CARNARVON. 171 also indicated that they were working for their livelihood, and not, as in the case of their more fortunate sisters, whiling away a few idle moments. At Barmouth, as indeed in most English seaside places, the beach, contrary to the Continental custom, is not the promenade par excellence. After bathing-time the sands are almost completely deserted for the neighbouring hills and the places to which excursions can so conveniently be made from Barmouth, such as the \" Panorama Walk,\" a lovely natural terrace, situated on the road to Dolgelly, and commanding a magnificent view over the valley of the Mawddach. In the town itself there is a good deal of animation, for the unique street of the locality is also the main road, and people pass it whether bound for Dolgelly and the Mawddach, or Llanaber. At different hours of the day streams of visitors go up and down this street, the men and women on foot, the children perched on donkeys, forming long cara vans having nothing very oriental about them save the cloud of dust they raise as they pass. The men, all over England, seem to wear pretty well the same kind of dress, but the Avomen, as if obeying some unwritten law, and submitting to the occult rules of some feminine freemasonry, or may be \u2014 and that would be a simpler explanation \u2014 folloAving the dictates of some local milliner, appear to us to adopt in various regions a kind of distinctive article of dress, chiefly a hat or cap. At Barmouth, nine out of eArery ten women, from the lady visitors to the hotel servants, wrore the hideous double-peaked caps with a little black top-knot, which are so unbecoming that even young and pretty girls do not look well in them. A matronly lady with gold spectacles, grey hair, and a kind of ulster very light in colour, had one of these things on her head, and what with her strange masculine gait, and the umbrella she wielded in the most unwomanly fashion, looked a very remarkable person indeed as she strutted up and down the street. Sea-fishing and boating are indulged in by many visitors, this being a most enjoyable manner of spending a few hours when the weather is fine and the sea smooth. The harbour is situated near the bridge, where boatmen are always ready to set out, and invite visitors in the most engaging manner to take a boat. \" Fine day for a sail, sir ; beautiful weather ! \" The wooden railway viaduct connecting the two banks of the Mawddach is used as a pier by the A'isitors, as well as a foot-bridge for crossing the river. It is nearly a mile in length including the two embankments (one on each side), between which extends the bridge properly so called. It is a wonder how the railway engineers have been able to construct these embankments on the moving sands, and how, having built them, they manage to keep them from being blown away by the wind or washed into the sea by the tide and Avaves. The bridge is narrow, the line being a single one all the way from Ruabon to Carnarvon, and this makes it appear even longer than it really is, although it takes about twenty-five minutes to get from one end to the other. From the middle of the viaduct, where we happened to be at sunset, the view of the Aralley of the Mawddach is most admirable, much finer, in fact, than from any of the surrounding heights. On each side extends a chain of mountains, some covered with a rich mantle of verdure, on which numerous flocks of sheep are seen grazing ; others bald and rugged, whose shadows fall on each other and give the landscape an everchanging aspect, the alteration in the colours and shades being most z 2"], [212, "SKETCHES OF ENGLAND. 172 interesting to watch. At the end the double chain of mountains seems to join and form a solid background, the broad MaAvddach having the appearance of a large lake or inland sea, enclosed in a semicircular range of capriciously outlined hills. Barmouth has its legend, of course, and tradition asserts that the bay in front of the town was formerly a large tract of land, and that immense fields and forests and valleys and towns, once inhabited by a prosperous population, were, in one night, submerged by the sea. Thus, it appears, was formed Cardigan Bay which has taken the place of a vast territory. The history of the disappearance of this Welsh Atlantis has, as may well be supposed, inspired many a national bard and poet, and it has been recorded in prose and verse. In commonplace prose the event may be told as follows : \u2014 The country being Ioav, it had been found necessary to erect sea walls provided with flood-gates, in order to alloAV the numerous watercourses to flow into the sea. Now the flood-gates were, it is needless to say, closed at high-water, and the duty of opening and closing them at the proper time devolved upon an important functionary who was styled Captain of the Gates. This official, after copious libations, one night, Avhen all the inhabitants were asleep, forgot to close the flood-gates, Avith the result above mentioned, that, between sunset and sunrise, cities and villages Avere destroyed, and thousands and thousands of men Avere drowned Avithout reckoning Avomen and little children, as says Rabelais. That was very sad, no doubt ; but everything happens for the best, and the people of Barmouth have every reason to congratulate themselves on this terrible calamity. In fact, if they were not the most ungrateful people on earth, they should have, long ago, erected a monument of some kind to Seithenyn, for such was the name of the captain of the flood-gates, to whom they are indebted for the prosperity of this pleasant little toAvn. For AA'hat would they and their place have been but for Seithenyn's drunkenness ? Nothing but dwellers in an insignificant inland little village, living a commonplace sort of life, far from all the blessings of civilisation and out of the track of railways and tourists, and unable to enjoy the adArantages resulting from the passing of the former, and the more or less prolonged stay of the latter. Instead of that, Barmouth is a sea-side place, a bathing resort much frequented by tourists and holiday makers, who stay there for weeks, to the delight and profit of the inhabitants who, during the season, reap a rich harvest, and are prosperous and well-to-do people, liAdng in a pretty and picturesque little toAvn, and so salubrious withal, that it is recommended to invalids for a winter as Avell as a summer residence. Many people to whom statues have been raised were less deserving than Seithenyn, and the people of Barmouth should lose no time in repairing an injustice which, if persisted in, would be a blot indeed upon their reputation. Whilst talking of reputation, it is painful to have to record that the Barmouth people, as late as the first few years of this century, were notorious for plundering Avrecks. And even in the year of grace 1886, the Welsh do not shine as hospitable people, for we read in the newspapers that, during the gale of October of the same year, some of them refused to supply shipwrecked sailors with the necessaries of life before they were paid for ; and, but for the kindness of Lord Dunraven, who sent to the"], [213, "LLANGOLLEN, BARMOUTH, AND CARNARVON. 173 poor men clothes and money, they would have perished from cold and hunger. At the same time some dead bodies washed ashore by the sea were despoiled of their clothes by the population, Avhilst a man, Avhose name we regret to be unable to transmit to posterity, actually organized a shoAV Avith the dead bodies, for the view of Avhich he charged so much per head. This is about one of the most ghastly and repulsive examples of rapacious savagery ever recorded, and in the latter part of the nineteenth century too ! Have progress, civilisation, humanity, not yet made their way into Wales ? Whilst on the subject of civilisation and progress, it is to be noted that the art of advertising, at all events, has attained in the Principality a certain degree of perfection, and been pushed rather too far. The very hills and rocks are pressed into the service of the A Triumphal Aech. Carnarvon. Avily advertising agent, who dishonours the work of nature with flaming coloured posters, announcing cheap excursion trains, concert and theatrical performances, and conveying the Avelcome information to those who are not versed in the Welsh language, of the continuation of English opening services by the Rev. Somebody, D.D. Some beautiful picturesque rocks in the neighbourhood of Porkington Terrace Avere thus covered with multi-coloured placards, AAdiilst a blank wall opposite rejoiced in spotless whitewash. That the Welsh have but a very hazy notion of the value of time, our experience of the Hotel at Barmouth was conclusive proof; but for downright want of punctuality, commend us to the Cambrian Railway. The train timed to leave Barmouth at half-past nine"], [214, "174 SKETCHES OF ENGLAND. did not start till a few minutes before eleven o'clock, and, for one hour and twenty minutes or more, passengers were kept waiting on the platform, where, fortunately, a wooden bench or form ran along the whole length of a sort of shed, which is the only shelter from wind or rain on the side of the line we had to start from. The people there did not seem in the least surprised at the delay, which they looked upon as a matter of course. Indeed our impatience rather amused them than evoked their sympathy, for such contretemps are so frequent that they are accustomed to them. To us, however, the contrast between the punctuality, comfort, and generally excellent arrangements of the English lines of railway Avas most striking and unpleasant. There is nothing A'ery remarkable on the road. At Harlech, hoAArever, a good view of the castle is to be had from the platform. The venerable ruin stands on an eminence, some tAvo hundred feet above the level of the sea. As far as can be judged from the station, it is some- Avhat small, but its situation, on the edge of a precipitous cliff, gives it an imposing air, and it is easy to realise how, in the fifteenth century, it was considered one of the most famous and formidable strongholds in Wales. As it now stands, the castle, seen from afar, is a picturesque looking fortress of quadrangular plan, flanked at its four angles by large round towers. The rock on which it rises was formerly laved by the waves, but the sea has receded and has left dry a strip of land, about half a mile wide, on which the railroad now passes. It is said that the popular and inspiriting \" March of the Men of Harlech,\" so well played on the national harp by our friend at Llangollen, Avas composed in the fifteenth century, at the time Avhen the castle was undergoing a siege which ended in the surrender, through famine, of the fortress to Edward IV. Harlech Castle is the property of the Crown, and there is at the present time a fortunate being who rejoices in the title and dignity of Constable of Harlech Castle. Who this lucky individual is, and what his duties may be, are questions we are unable to answer, not haAdng been able to obtain any information on the subject. It would greatly surprise us to hear that this functionary is overworked and underpaid, bearing in mind the onerous duties of the Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, for instance, who, it may be remembered, is also Constable of Dover Castle. At Afonwen Junction, the Cambrian Raihvay, which goes on to Pwllheli, transfers to the tender care of the London and North- Western Railway those among the passengers Avho are bound for Carnarvon. A remarkable fact in connection with railway travelling in provincial England struck us considerably, and that is the small number of second-class passengers. Nearly everybody travels either first or third-class, and it must be admitted that the difference in comfort between second and third class carriages is so small that it is certainly not worth the difference in the fares. Either the third-class carriages are too comfortable or the second class compartments not enough so ; but as it is, there is no room for an intermediate class between the first and third. As a matter of fact, in a long train of from twelve to fourteen carriages, there was not a single second-class compartment. The line between Afomven and Carnarvon passes through a valley where numerous herds of black cattle were grazing. They are a peculiar breed of animals, small, and looking very much like our OAvn Brittany cows. A remarkable feature in Welsh and English country"], [215, "LLANGOLLEN, BARMOUTH, AND CARNARVON. 175 scenery and life is that oxen are never used as beasts of burden, the English always using horses for all agricultural purposes, ploughing, carting, etc. Carnarvon is situated on the Menai Straits, at the mouth of the river Seoint. It is an old town, and was formerly the capital of the Segontiaci. Under the Roman domination it rose in importance, and became a city of considerable repute. At a later period Hugh Lupus, Earl of Chester, fortified the town, Avhich was then called by the Welsh Caer-yn-Arvon, the fort in Arvon, a name it has ever since retained, though in a slightly modified form. In the thirteenth century the castle and walls were built by Edward I., who made it one of the most important fortresses in the Principality. At subsequent periods Carnarvon underwent several sieges, notably in the fifteenth century, and also during the civil wars in 1646, Avheu it was captured by the Parliamentarians under the leadership of Captain Swanby. Carnarvon A Sketch in Carnarvon. is now the principal port for the exportation of slates from the numerous quarries in the district, and carries on an important coasting trade with London, Liverpool, Bristol, Glasgow, and Dublin. We happened to arrive at Carnarvon on the last day of the Eisteddfodd of 1886, which had been graced with the presence of the Lord Mayor of London on the opening day. An Eisteddfodd may be described as a musical and literary competition at which prizes are given to the best performers, instrumental or vocal, and for the best essays or poetry written in the Welsh language. The object of these competitions is to keep up the national art and literature, which, however, are fast disappearing. These meetings, it is needless to say, bring to the place in which they are held a great number of people from the neighbouring districts, and we therefore found Carnarvon bristling with animation and thronged with a"], [216, "SKETCHES OF ENGLAND. 176 great crowd of sightseers. In the narrow and somewhat tortuous streets there was a great display of flags and bunting, of flowers and evergreens, giving to the old city a gay and festive appearance, heightened by the fine sunny weather. Triumphal arches had been erected at various places, and curious things they were in the way of street decoration. They were composed of a light wooden bridge running from one side of the street to the other, on which three compartments, divided by a small partition and closed with wire fencing, formed so many cages, in each of which was a goat with gilded horns\u2014 the proverbial Welsh nanny-goat. It was a pitiable sight, that of these poor animals cooped up in a narrow space, with a scanty supply of food and water; and at night, with the gas jets considerately placed under the light structure, it seemed as if the unfortunate goats were in imminent risk of being roasted alive. Fortunately they all escaped with their lives, for the next day we saw them brought down none the worse, to all appearance, for their three days' stay in their aerial cage. As a matter of course these arches were decorated with festoons and garlands of floAvers, flags, bunting, and inscriptions in Welsh. One inscription, however, was in English, and was, no doubt, meant as a special compliment to the Lord Mayor, to whom it intimated that his lordship was \" Welcome to Carnarvon.\" Having been told that there were concerts and various competitions going on at the Pavilion, Ave hastened to that establishment, Avhich is approached by a steep road branching off from the main street, We arrived just in time to hear the applause which greeted the A'ictorious band on its coming out of the hall, the lusty musicians blowing away in their brass instruments with a will and energy Avorthy of all praise. This was a severe disap pointment, but fortunately there was in the adjacent grounds another competition going on. What the competition was about Avas not quite clear, as English, pronounced with a strong Welsh accent, is not easily understood by foreigners ; however, we hoped for the best, and going round the Pavilion we arrived at the spot Avhere Ave had been directed to go. On a slope of an eminence called, if Ave mistake not, Twt Hill, Avas a square enclosure round Avhich an attentive and very silent croAvd was pressing, five or six deep, and forming an impenetrable barrier. Every available coign of 'vantage, whether a wall, a wheelbarrow, a cart, a haystack, or a single block of stone or slate, had been seized upon by the eager spectators, whose attention was riveted to the sight within the enclosure, still hidden from our view by the people. From Avithin, a kind of hammering noise, not very loud, rose, and increased our anxiety to see what Avas going on there, as the excitement in the crowd had already awakened our legitimate curiosity. Our questions on the subject had been readily answered it is true, by those who understood us ; but, unfortunately, their replies were unintelligible to us for the reason above mentioned, and we were \"no forrarder,\" as a Scotchman once told the scribe, after smoking a delicious Egyptian cigarette, and taking up his pipe which he filled with the strongest Cavendish tobacco to be found in the United Kingdom. Of course this was most tantalising. At last we managed to climb up a ladder, the higher rungs of Avhich were occupied by as many people as it could bear without breaking, and we were just enabled to glance at the scene being enacted inside the enclosure. And what was there to be seen ? About twenty or thirty men engaged in the soul-stirring occupation of slate-cutting"], [217, "LLANGOLLEN, BARMOUTH, AND CARNARVON. 177 and splitting, for this was the object of the competition ; an interesting one, no doubt, to the native population, a great many of whom are working in the neighbouring slate quarries, but to us an unmeaning affair ; for, much as we appreciate slates on the roofs of our dwellings, the working of these slabs of argillaceous stone is an art with which we are wholly unacquainted. In the street there was a great crowd standing before the entrance gate of the Pavilion, awaiting the proclamation of the names of the successful competitors ; but the majority of the sightseers were slowly perambulating the various thoroughfares, and looking with unfeigned admiration at the floral and other decorations. These people had come from long distances to be present at their annual festival, and comprised among them men and women from every district in North Wales \u2014 miners, fishermen, agricultural labourers, farmers great and small ; in short a more representative assemblage of the various types of people in the country could hardly be got together. For this reason they Avere most interesting to us, and we passed a Carnarvon Castle. good deal of our time mixing among them. We were much struck wdth their unhealthy and puny appearance, their wan faces and sickly complexions. Instead of a sturdy set of men, such as are generally to be found in mountainous districts on the Continent, we' found a race of men of short stature, ill-built, and lacking that muscular power so much appreciated in England. The Welsh people we saw formed a most remarkable contrast to the stalwart men of Kent we had met with at Dover and Rochester, and the country around these places. Whether this is attributable to their occupations, mode of living, or any other cause, we could not ascertain ; and as to the climate, there is no reason to suppose that Wales is not as healthy a place as any in Britain. It goes without saying that the Castle is the \"lion\" of Carnarvon. The old fortress, begun in 1283 by Edward L, and completed nearly forty years later by Edward IL, stands on the right bank of the river Seoint, at the west end of the town. Viewed from the outside, Carnarvon Castle, whose external walls are in a perfect state of preservation, is one of the most splendid specimens of ancient military architecture to be seen in the kingdom. It is A A"], [218, "SKETCHES OF ENGLAND. 178 flanked by thirteen polygonal towers of different dimensions, surmounted by lighter turrets rising above the highest battlements. The principal entrance, called King's Gate, is approached by a bridge at the end of Castle Street, The moat is uoav only a sort of deep trench where a thick kind of grass grows abundantly, and where a quantity of rubbish has been shot. Over the entrance rises a large square tower, in which is a niche occupied by a statue of EdAvard II. The king is represented standing, his hand resting on the hilt of his sAvord. The statue is unfortunately in a somewhat dilapidated condition. Passing under the gate, one is confronted by an attendant, Avho collects the entrance fees, sells photographs of the Castle, and at the same time dispenses sundry non-intoxicating drinks. There is also a visitors' book, in which very witty persons have recorded their impressions in facetious entries, signed among others by a gentleman Avho subscribed himself \"Nobody\" and gave his address at \"Nowhere,\" Avhilst his companion, who li\\red at the same place, signed himself \" Nobody, junior.\" The interior is far from realising the expectations raised by the outAArard appearance of the castle, for nothing is left but the bare walls, enclosing an open space in which a feAv sheep are kept. The toAvers, so admirable Avhen seen from the outside, disclose enormous gashes and gaps, half hidden, in some instances, by creepers and iv}T, but in most cases the ravages of time are only too visible. The western towers are less injured than the others ; one of them has been repaired and fitted up for the local museum, having been provided with an iron and glass roof of a most incongruous effect. Near the museum is the Eagle Tower, the finest and loftiest of all. It derives its name from the sculptured eagles with Avhich it is ornamented. The ascent of the Eagle ToAver, Avithout being difficult, is nevertheless tiresome, as a good many of the hundred aud fifty-eight stone steps leading to the summit are in a sad condition, and it is necessary to be careful when going up, and still more so when coming down. The view from the summit is very beautiful. Immediately at the foot of the tower runs the Seoint, crowded with shipping, its right bank (on which stands the castle) being covered with a number of slate trucks, the contents of Avhich are being transferred to the holds of the vessels moored alongside the quay, whilst the opposite bank rejoices in luxuriant trees and verdure. To the west and north are the Menai Straits, on the other side of Avhich the island of Anglesey, low on the Avater like a dismantled ship, extends its line of sandbanks. The coast of the island is dotted Avith villages, whose white houses stand out conspicuously on the treeless ground. To the east the houses of Carnarvon cluster round the castle, and here and there portions of the old walls can be distinguished among the newer buildings, the toAvn having greatly outgroAvn its original limits. Beyond, on the south-east, the background is formed by the chain of the Carnarvonshire mountains, dominated by the peak of Snowdon. On whatever side one chooses to look an admirable panorama is disclosed to view, and on this account alone the ascension of the Eagle ToAver should by no means be missed. At night the toAvn Avas illuminated, the streets being well lighted by numerous \u00bbas jets arranged on the facades of the houses, and on the triumphal arches, which somehow managed not to catch fire, although every provocation was given them. The crowd was very well behaved indeed, exhibiting no signs of rudeness or drunkenness, and seemed quite"], [219, "LLANGOLLEN, BARMOUTH, AND CARNARVON. 179 contented Avith sight-seeing, without giving expression to their feelings; for, with the exception of the children, whose laughter, far from boisterous, was occasionally heard, the people were silent. On the open space at the foot of the castle, near the river, the animation Avas greater than anywhere else, for there was all the \" fun of the fair.\" Swings and roundabouts, moved by steam machinery, and driven at a furious rate, at the imminent risk to the holiday makers of being dismounted or thrown out of the carriages by centrifugal force ; shooting saloons, decorated with the most extraordinary paintings ever beheld by the artist, Avho went into a fit of rapturous laughter at the sight of a British soldier bayoneting an incredible number of Zulus, the drawing and colouring being excruciatingly funny. All these were well patronised until about half-past nine, when the glaring petroleum-lamps, with long flames, swaying to and fro in the breeze, and filling the atmosphere with an offensive smell, were put out, the fountain in the market-place or square ceased to play, and the people went home. The next day, early in the morning, we happened to pass that way ; but roundabouts and swings and shooting saloons had disappeared, and nothing was left to recall the rejoicings of the preceding night. Carnarvon had re sumed its normal appearance, and the excursionists who had not left the town by the late trains the night before were hurrying to the station, bound for the four corners of Wales. And we, too, Avere about to leave Carnarvon, Avithout regret, it must be admitted. The place has few attractions beyond its castle ; and the local inn-keepers certainly make things as uncomfortable as they possibly can. During our stay there we Avere reading in the daily papers an account of Signor Succi's fasting experiment : hoAV we wished for a phial of his liquor to enable us to live without having to A Carnarvon Character partake of the execrable food served in Welsh hotels ! What an invaluable boon his mix ture would prove to those Avho intend to visit the Principality ! Here ends the record of what has been, on the whole, a very pleasant trip to England and to Wales, if not the record of all our impressions. For having enjoyed English hospitality, we were enabled to form a fairly complete opinion of English life. Hoav far our impressions are accurate it is not for us to say, and we feel some diffidence in briefly summing them up. The reason is that although many foreigners have written about England, yet not one of them has ever been considered by English critics as having formed a correct judgment. The verdict generally \u2014 one might say invariably \u2014 pronounced is, \" Foreigners don't understand us \" ; and this seems to the English a sufficient explanation. We beg to be allowed to differ, and to express the opinion that it may be that, after all, English people are unintelligible : not so bold an assumption if Ave bear in mind that an eminent Englishman said that anomaly"], [220, "SKETCHES OF ENGLAND. 180 is the distinctive character of his countrymen. There is also another argument which has some bearing upon the question. May we not assume that if foreigners do not understand Englishmen, it is because, abroad, Englishmen are taken at their own valuation ; and that when foreigners come to England, they are surprised to find that the inhabitants of the British Isles are neither the very superior beings which they would like to be taken for, nor the eccentric and unaccountable people they are too often reported to be ? As far as we have been able to judge, it seems to us that the English, apart from certain peculiarities indigenous of the soil, and which are due chiefly, no doubt, to their geographi cal position and the \" silver streak\" which stands them in such good stead, are very much like other people, and swayed by the same feelings as men of other races. In other words, we left England Avith the deep-rooted conviction that human nature is very much the same everywhere, and that the United Kingdom is no exception to the rule, much as this may shock those who hold that the English is a superior race, and those, on the other hand, avIio think it is quite the reverse. Of course, wTe have purposely avoided touching politics, and as to commerce and industry, there can be but one opinion where England is concerned. Finally, we have a pleasing duty to perform, aud it is to record the extreme kindness, courtesy, and hospitality Avhich we met Avith in every place we went to. This is a superiority which no one Avho has travelled in England wdll deny the English, and which we gratefully acknoAvledge. P-t-NTUD BY J. s.
