Our yf'II^C community is still so small, and so very young, that six hundred quarto pages devoted -=g*S) to its history might appear a treatment not merely ample, but verging upon excess. The local reader, perhaps, will have enough of special interest in the pioneer details of the colony to feel no such disproportion ; but even upon a more cosmopolitan view, the story of Victoria, taken as a type of the nineteenth century offshoots of the Anglo-Saxon stock, has most decidedly its sources of permanent interest. For it is a comparatively safe prophecy that the historian of three centuries hence, looking back on the broad current of events, will see no movement of the human race so commanding in its predominance as the process by which the English-speaking race has encompassed the world in this epoch of ours. And to relate how these daughter-states first took their origin, what difficulties beset them, what manner of men were their pioneers, and what their vicissitudes and their triumphs, must ultimately have no little value in the records of our race. Of ordinary history we have none. Battles, sieges, and rebellions ; the deaths of kings and the changes of dynasties ; the dungeon, the axe, and the martyr's stake \u2014 all those incidents which form the picturesque in history are absent from our story. But in exchange we have those triumphs of peace which the world is more and more inclined to regard with Milton as being no less renowned than war. Though the largeness of the volume may be a surprise to the reader, its smallness has been the chief trouble of the writer. Quite a mass of details has been of necessity omitted ; names of scores of pioneers who made their mark in our early story, and many incidents both interesting and suggestive, have been reluctantly passed over, or but barely mentioned, in order to keep the volume within reasonable compass. In spite of care, there will of a certainty be found a little crop of inaccuracies. Indeed the writer will be glad if he discovers, as the reward for much labour, that no serious or fundamental blunder has been made. Whenever an error is detected, however, he will cheerfully acknowledge and rectify it when a fitting opportunity is presented. ALEXANDER SUTHERLAND."], [14, ""], [15, "CONTENTS OF VOL. I.

Pills &lfPl am* l'lc<*' \"' t'lc m,(1'st: r,f ''is ardent toils, was never privileged to set foot on it, 1 \u2014 ' never permitted to be within a thousand miles of it, while those who first saw it, whose feet first trod our soil, were careless men who knew nothing of the value of what they had found, and who, as a matter of fact, were ignorant that they had found anything. To men of this class it is impossible to attribute the credit of discovering Australia. These Dutchmen in their yacht, the Duyfhen, though the first of civilized race that pressed Australian soil, died in ignorance that they had seen a continent. No ! the honour of Australian discovery belongs to yonder worn and wasted Spaniard, who is gasping his last breath in the fevered heat of Panama; not old, though old in looks; the crowning effort of his life was near, but the vital force of that feeble frame was doomed to flicker out ere the life-long task was accomplished. This is the captain whom the Spaniards name with reverence as the last of their great list of noble mariners, Fernandez de Ouiros. In his youth he had sailed with Mendana, and brought back to Mexico the grisly remnant of that death-smitten colony; and on his return he laid before the Governor of Peru a memorial, proving that somewhere in the great ocean of the south there must exist a continent, the Terra Australis, as he called it. The Governor gave him letters for Phillip III. of Spain,' and there at the Court of Madrid he spent seven weary years of waiting and pleading; till at length the interest of the monarch was touched, and the sailor carried back to Peru instructions for the fitting out of a fleet. Accordingly three vessels, breasting the vast Pacific, sailed from the Peruvian coast in December 1605. The Capitana bore the flag of De Ouiros himself, the Almirantii carried that of his lieutenant Torres, and a smaller ship, the Zabra, accompanied them as a sort of tender. Month after month they picked their way in their small craft from island to island, but saw none of any great extent, 1 Dalrymple I., 9S. Vol. I. B"], [22, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 2 until they heard from some natives of much more extensive land to the south-west. Holding that course for a time they reached a shore, which they followed south for a day or two without reaching the end. They turned into a spacious bay, behind whose wide sweep of sparkling beach the tree-clad forests ran far up towards the clouds on lofty hills; the aspect of the place was continental, and De Quiros was convinced that here was the continent he had dreamt of. The land was beautiful, but many of the sailors were sick of the voyage; a mutinous spirit arose on board the Capitana, and De Ouiros had to send his second officer on board the Almiranta. But there was still a great body of disaffected left on board. One night the mutineers took possession of the ship, and in strict silence, amid the darkness, worked her out of the bay and sailed for Mexico. De Quiros, compelled to navigate the ship, saw all the toils of so many years fade into dimness and disappointment. The Almiranta, followed by the Zabra, coasted the land for days to discover the missing ship, and in so doing demonstrated that it was only an island, the largest of the New Hebrides, now known as Espiritu Santo. Torres and his men were more inclined to sail onward for the Phillipine Islands, where the Spaniards then had settlements. He held almost due west till he reached the extremity of New Guinea, whose northern shores had at that time been explored, but he was entering on wholly new explorations when he kept to the south shore. -However, by so doing he just missed the chance of discovering Australia, for he saw no more than the rocky islets that stud the sea round Cape York, and knew nothing of the great continent lying beyond. Torres was undoubtedly the first to sail through the strait that very properly now bears his name. But he was not a great navigator like his commander. He did not even know that he had sailed through a strait, and his work added nothing of importance to the knowledge of the world. De Ouiros, after landing in Mexico, found his way back to Spain, and, after more years of weary waiting, and many glowing descriptions of the supposed continent he had been privileged to see, once more obtained a commission for an expedition. With the precious scroll in his possession he fell sick upon the road, and under the palm trees of Panama he laid his worn-out bones. Meanwhile, a party of Dutchmen had actually seen and landed on the continent that was the unfulfilled dream of his life. The Dutch had long been settled in Java, and from their head quarters, Batavia, they sent out many little cruising expeditions. One of these on board the yacht Dnyfhen, after following the south coast of New Guinea, towards the east, seems to have been misled, probably during thick weather, along the chain of islets that everywhere break the waters of Torres Straits, the Dutchmen thinking that it was a continuous coast, and so they struck the eastern shores of the Gulf of Carpentaria, which they took to be a southern prolongation of New Guinea. When they reached the corner of the Gulf, and were just able to see that the coast trended west, some of the crew were imprudent enough to land unarmed, and were savagely butchered by the blacks. The aspect of the country was bare, the provisions on board the vessel were runnin-r short, and the fate of their comrades hung heavy on their hearts. They turned for home ; but they had nothing to say of any new continent; their talk was only of New Guinea, and it is by the merest chance that we are now able to compute that this otherwise unnoted expedition must have been the first to touch Australian soil in the early part of the year 1606. The Dutch in their East Indian settlements were so near to Australia that it is not surprising to find that in the course of half a century, many of their vessels on the way from the Cape of Good Hope to Batavia, sighted the coast of the unknown continent. In 1616, Dick"], [23, "THE EARLY DLSCOVERERS OF AUSTRALLA. 3 Hartog landed on the west coast; in 1618, Zaachen for several hundred miles skirted the north coast, and during the following year Edel made a rough chart of most of the western shores.- So, from time to time, the coast became known, and the knowledge gradually dawned on the Dutch that a great continent lay south of New Guinea. In 1627 Nuyts explored part of the south coast, and in 1628 General Carpenter sailed into the great gulf, which takes its name from him. But in all these accidental explorations the Dutch proceeded with such jealous caution that not a word of them was known in Europe, and so far as the real progress of knowledge was concerned, they might as well never have been made. Still it remains a fact that these were the first explorations of Australian coasts. For although the learned Mr. Major, with vast pains and ingenuity, has striven to show that some Portuguese must have seen these shores nearly a century before, his contention is founded only on a set of old charts, whose likeness to Australia is very remote, and which can be shown with much probability to have been merely early and distorted charts of the north shores of New Guinea. We do not yield the honours of discovery, however, to mere stumblers such as these Dutchmen were. But, in 1642, we find a Dutchman of a very different stamp, Abel Janscn Tasman Of his early life we know nothing. It is only at the time when he attracted the notice of Anthon)' Van Diemen, then Governor-General of the Dutch Settlements, that he comes into view. That restless governor wished to signalise his period of office by extensions of territory and new discovery; and he had the discrimination to select Tasman as the right man for his purpose. Hence on 14th August of the year 1642, the great square-sterned ships, of bulging sides and quaint devices, the Heemskirk and the Zeelian, were ready to sail from Batavia under Tasman's command. They swept the ocean for three weeks, south-west to the Mauritius, but meeting no land in all that course, they turned southwards and penetrated towards the mists and storms of the Polar Seas; at latitude 500 they desisted, and turning north-east had the good fortune after a time to come in sight of land, which we now know to be the west coast of Tasmania. It was high, and bold, and picturesque, but no way suited for landing on. So the Dutchmen held their way south along the surf-tormented cliffs, and on the chart the name \" Van Diemen's Land\" was inscribed in honour of the patron of the voyage. They found no opportunity of landing till they had rounded the three southern capes, and stood north into Storm Bay, and when they did land they were so filled by a foolish fear that had seized them of the gigantic stature of the people of these shores that they scarcely viewed the beautiful shores of the mouth of the Derwent. Nevertheless, though they feared to land, they took perpetual possession of the country in the name of the Dutch Republic, a performance that pleased them, and did nobody else any harm. Their further course carried them to the shores of New Zealand, of which Tasman was the first discoverer, and where they met with a variety of adventures which did not tend to make them prolong their stay. Their voyage then took them down among the Fiji and other South Sea groups, wherein they made notable discoveries ; but at length they turned for home, and keeping to the north of New Guinea reached Batavia, after a most interesting expedition of ten months' duration. The maps which Van Diemen transmitted to Holland, to report the discoveries made by Tasman, showed that in one way or another nearly half of the shores of Australia had been explored; their general outline was fairly well mapped; but New Flinders, Introduction to first volume."], [24, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 4 Guinea and Tasmania were marked as continuous with the continent. In 1664 Tasman was again sent out on an expedition. This we know, and we know the names of his ships ; but the rest we do not know. Whether he ever returned, and if he did, what were the fruits of his voyage, we cannot now discover. Possibly the Limmen and the Zeemien went out and came back no more; perhaps they returned with many new discoveries; but if so the jealous Dutchmen so carefully concealed their knowledge that not a breath of it is now to be obtained, though it is on the whole very probable that they did return, but that their charts and information were suppressed. The Dutch regarded this new continent as being theirs by the right of prior discover)-, and about 1660, while Charles II. was King in England, and the English nowise concerned with what went forward in these seas, the little Republic gave the name New Holland to the entire continent, and entered it upon the list of their possessions. But during the reign of the careless monarch, the first of that long roll of English navigators who completed the work that the Dutch began, was obtaining his training in a seafaring life. William Dampier had in youth deserted his pleasant Somersetshire home for a sailor's life, but in early manhood had returned to the green meadows of England. A year or two of inactive life made him glad to join in a venture to the West Indies. There he accepted a situation on a sugar plantation, but soon grew tired of the horrors of slave-driving. He crossed to Honduras to cut logwood in the tropical forests. Tiring also of this laborious life, he again turned his face towards England, and was already on board ship, when a buccaneering vessel entered the harbour. Therein was an old companion of his, who persuaded him to join the lawless crew, not pirates as we too often esteem them, but rather privateers who made war upon the Spaniards and gathered spoils whenever they could, irrespective of the policy of their country at home. Whether England and Spain were at peace or war was of no concern to them. They fought and stripped the Spaniard wherever and whenever they could catch him. What a life of adventure Dampier then entered on ! But also in many ways a hateful life ; for these men were outlawed by their country, and having thrown off all restraint the lives they led were such as soon disgusted the more scrupulous mind of Dampier. Together with forty-seven of the more respectable of the buccaneers he escaped from their license, and after a perilous journey across the northern part of South America, they found themselves compelled to join another band for their own preservation. But after a time a small vessel arrived commanded by Captain John Cook, an old intimate of Dampier's. Cook proposed to circumnavigate the world and plunder everything Spanish on his way, and Dampier joined the trip. They first ran over to the Gulf of Guinea. There the buccaneers saw a large Danish ship of thirty-six guns at anchor. Denmark was at that time at peace with all the world, and these Danes had no suspicions. They allowed the innocent-looking craft to run almost alongside, though her crew, armed to the teeth, were lurking behind the bulwarks. The buccaneers sprang on board, and in five minutes the ship was theirs. They put out to sea, and were cruel enough to set the Danes ashore on a lonely part of the African coast. They called their new vessel the Bachelor's Delight, and finding her strong and victualled for a long voyage, they started on a cruise round the world; but it was not long before the captain was killed, and the crew took the ship back to Panama. There they discovered that the Spanish Government had resolved to suppress these pests of their colonies, and had sent out a strong fleet for the purpose. The buccaneers gathered all their forces; there was a week of desultory skirmishing; the frothy courage of the freebooters vanished ; they scattered in all directions, and Dampier was"], [25, "THE EARLY DISCOVERERS OF AUSTRALIA. 5 glad to escape from his unpleasant companions and shift for himself in the West Indies. He was spending his time in enforced idleness when Captain Swan in the Cygnet came out to these parts. He had a staunch little vessel, well fitted out with a cargo for legitimate trade. It was proposed to do business among the Spanish colonies ; but the Spaniards refused to treat ; the crew grew sick of wandering up and down from port to port; and finally they threw overboard the whole cargo, and compelled Captain Swan to take them off on a plundering expedition. The ship sailed for the East Indies, but on reaching the Philippine Islands the crew, who thought that Swan was very half-hearted in the business, set him ashore with forty-five of the seamen who elected to stay with him. Dampier, who deemed their chance of survival very small, preferred to stay in the ship and wait for a more favourable opportunity of escaping. For a long time the Cygnet wandered up and down among the Dutch and Spanish settlements of the East Indies; but at length she required to be careened. She did not dare to seek an English port, and yet she had made the shores of all the East Indian islands too dangerous to venture a long stay on them. Dampier suggested the coasts of that new continent to the south, said to have been discovered by the Dutch, and accordingly in January, 1688, just on the eve of the great revolution in England, they warped their vessel ashore on the north coast, near the cluster of islands called after them \u2014 \" Buccaneers' Archipelago.\" At each low tide she was quite dry, and the crew spent these intervals in repairing and cleansing her. These were the first white men that ever made even a short stay in Australia, if we except the shipwrecked crew of Captain Pelsart sixty years before. They lived for ten weeks in tents ashore, and made assiduous efforts to cultivate the acquaintance of the blacks, whom they would have wished to compel to do the hard work that was necessary. At length they caught a few, put some old clothes on them, and gave them kegs of water to carry from the distant wells, wherein they found their only fresh water. The blacks, however, only grinned and nodded affably, put down the kegs, divested themselves of the clothes, and thinking the performance was over, sought their promised rewards. Nor could they be induced to understand that labour was wanted of them, and Dampier records in his travels that they are among the most senseless of men. This was the first time that the natives of Australia were observed by civilized men, and unluckily, the inhabitants of these parts are the least favourable of the whole continent. He states that they are a naked black people, who wear a piece of the rind of a tree tied like a girdle round their waists, and that the two fore teeth of the upper jaw arc wanting in all of them. He saw no bows nor arrows among them: nor did he notice any boats or canoes, and he says that the natives used no houses. Here, then, for the first time, our aboriginal population was described, and our national kangaroo for the first time seen by white men. As soon as the Cygnet reached the Nicobar Islands, Dampier abandoned his licentious associates, who continued their plundering cruise for a long time, till at length their ship, grown rotten, suddenly sank off the coast of Madagascar. But Dampier, after many and toilsome adventures, found rest on his native shores. In his absence the Stuart kings had been expelled. He was now the subject of King William the Third, whose active mind was easily stirred by hopes of glorious maritime discovery. Hearing of the field open for such work in the South Seas, he caused a small vessel, the Roebuck, to be fitted out, and he made William Dampier its commander. She was well provisioned, and her crew of fifty picked men was purposely kept small. This voyage was uneventful, till on the 1st of August, 1699, they saw the coast of Australia, and anchored in Shark Bay. They were in want of fresh water, but five days' search yielded them none. During all the remainder of"], [26, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 6 August they crept cautiously along the shore, frequently landing in search of water; but they found only a muddy puddle, that was of no use save for boiling oatmeal. Fresh water, however, they must have, or else bring their voyage to a summary termination ; and Dampier, with two men, started on a trip inland for the purpose of finding the blacks, and from them learning the position of a stream or well. But they were caught by an angry tribe, who would have massacred them all three had not Dampier shot one, when all the others fled. Dampier notices that the shores are sandy and miserable, with little vegetation and nothing fit for food ; and, unfortunately, this description is only too true of the land immediately along the northern coast. It could provide nothing to eat, and so far as Dampier could discover, not even water to drink. The natives were blinking creatures, with frizzled hair, and the chiefs made themselves handsome with streaks of white clay on their black bodies. After spending in all about two months on this coast, of which they examined about twelve hundred miles, Dampier turned his vessel due north for Timor, and his further explorations were prosecuted in other parts of the world. His voyages, published on his return to England, added much to our knowledge of many lands ; and amid his pleasant descriptions of favoured islands, the terrible barrenness and the miserable people of Australia , stood out with unpleasant prominence. He said that the only pleasure he had experienced was the satisfaction of having seen the most miserable spot on this earth, and the most wretched of its inhabitants \u2014 homeless creatures, starved and scorched, red and swollen in the eyes through the constant attacks of flies, a race beyond all others unhappy in themselves and in their country. What wonder that the widely-read volumes of Dampier were for years an effectual check on further explorations in Australia. About the time of Dampier's voyages a considerable addition was made to the world's knowledge of Australia by the visit of the Dutch commodore Vlaming to the western coast.3 This was not in its main object a voyage of discovery; it was intended to search for the crew of a Dutch ship that had for twelve years been missing; some of the unhappy seamen might, it was thought, be still surviving on the coast of the great South Land, but the commodore saw no traces of them or of the missing men. In his search he not only landed frequently and examined the country a little way inland, but also formed a very correct chart of almost all the west coast. His account of the country he saw was not flattering. It is therefore not surprising to find a great gap in the story of Australian exploration, both Dampier and Vlaming having reported so unfavourably of its coasts. But it was reserved for a much greater navigator to discover the prepossessing side of this great continent, and to direct public attention to its vast capabilities. Our celebrated Captain James Cook was not sent out for the purpose of visiting these shores. It was in the service of astronomy that he entered on our southern seas. For the scientific world was very anxious to find the distance of our earth from the sun, and the calculation was shown to be possible if the occurrence of a transit of Venus could be observed at two widely distant spots on the world's surface. That phenomenon is one that happens only at very long intervals, and the Royal Society of London urged the English Government not to let slip an opportunity that was rapidly approaching. It wished an observation to be made in the South Pacific Ocean, and the Government complying with its desires fitted out a vessel, the Endeavour, and appointed to it Lieutenant Cook. She was provisioned for eighteen months, and in her sailed a number of scientific gentlemen, including the astronomer, Mr. Green, and the naturalists, Mr. Joseph Banks and Dr. Solander. She sailed in July, 1768, and rounded Cape ** Flinders lviii., Vol. I."], [27, "THE EARLY DISCOVERERS OF AUSTRALLA 7 Horn some six months after. In the following June the expedition was at Otaheite, and made a most successful observation of the transit. The object of his voyage being thus completed, Cook resolved to return to England by the Cape of Good Hope, and so to circumnavigate the world; but on his way he proposed to explore the seas he should traverse. For nearly a month he ran south, finding only an occasional small island; then to the north-west, doubling this way and that in the hopes of striking some considerable portion of land; but more than a month had passed ere his wish was gratified and he sighted the wild mountain ranges of New Zealand. Along the lovely cocoa-fringed beaches and the terrible cliffs of that magnificent coast he sailed for six months, completely circumnavigating both islands, and forming a chart more accurate than anything of the kind that had ever been obtained of any of these southern lands; but at length, in March, 1770, his work in New Zealand was accomplished, and he held west over the unknown ocean, speeding before a fresh and favouring gale. When three weeks were passed away a small land bird perched upon their rigging gave joyful token of land ahead, and on the 19th of April they saw it, long and low, the Ninety-mile Beach of the Victorian coast. Running north-east they found the shore soon rise in a sandy hill, which was called Cape Howe, and thence the coasts ran almost due north. Cook kept close in shore and made a careful chart, but did not succeed in landing till he reached a fine bay a couple of hundred miles to the north. This land-locked sheet of water offered a secure anchorage for the ship, and plenty of fresh water, so a stay was made in it for a few days. The country was examined and found to be vastly different from that seen by Dampier on the west coast. The hills rolled away to the west in rounded outline, all forest-clad to the far horizon, where they stood backed by the faint blue of a great range of mountains. The grass was fresh and abundant, the streams were pleasant, and the woods full of strange animals and very beautiful flowers. Indeed, Banks and Solander here made so rich a collection of plants new to science that Cook in commemoration called the inlet Botany Bay, a name in after years associated with ideas of anything but flower-like innocence and beauty. On the 6th of May they sailed out of this inlet, and steered along the coast, now rocky, now sandy, now showing only long wood-clad undulations; then it began to present those monotonous lines of mangroves drooping their foliage into the waters, sure sign that tropic regions were at hand ; and soon they could perceive by the palms in waving clumps or picturesque groves, that they were within that zone. One moonlight night the Endeavour struck heavily on a coral rock, and the sheathing boards, as well as the false keel from her bottom, were violently torn off. All expected destruction, but by great exertions and skilful management, she was not only preserved from sinking, but eventually floated off, with an old sail wrapped round her to partly stop the leak. She was taken to the inlet called the Endeavour River, and there run ashore. When the tide left her dry, it was seen that four planks had been cut through, and a great hole made by a jagged piece of coral, but that the rock itself having broken off, formed an almost complete plug for the hole, and thus saved the vessel from immediately foundering. Whilst repairs were being effected, Cook and the scientific gentlemen made long rambles through a pleasant tropical country, making the acquaintance of the kangaroo, the cockatoo, the flying-fox, the dingo, and the emu ; but at first the natives were very shy. However, when they discovered that presents of fish and beads and so forth were to be had by a visit to the strangers, they lost their timidity and became friendly. This kindness, however, was wholly mercenary, and when they made a demand for two turtles intended for the white men's dinner, and were refused, they departed in a violent rage, and by setting fire to the long dry"], [28, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS : PAST AND PRESENT. 8 grass did a great deal of damage to the property of the expedition, which was now mostly on shore. A man had to be shot and seriously wounded before the blacks would desist from their malicious attempts ; and a cordial footing was not again established. After six weeks' stay in this place, they sailed with their vessel tolerably well repaired. They had the greatest difficulty in passing through the Great Barrier Reef, which lines the whole of this coast, and makes it so dangerous; but skill was triumphant, and the vessel safely made her way to the northernmost point, which was called York Cape. Here the hope animated every breast that a passage would be found into the Indian Ocean ; for at this time the world was utterly unaware of the fact that Torres had sailed through this very strait a hundred and sixty years before, so completely was that voyage forgotten until the discovery of some old charts, when the British bombarded Manila a few years afterwards. Their hopes were well founded. A broad passage led them west to the- Indian Ocean, and thence they sped homeward round the Cape of Good Hope, bearing to England results of the utmost value, not only to astronomical but to geographical science. Before leaving the continent Cook had landed and taken possession of the country in the name of George III. of England. He called this eastern portion New South Wales, from some fancy that entered his head as to the resemblance between the coast he had just surveyed, and that of the southern portion of Wales. Cook's report as to this part of Australia, which he was the first to see, was very favourable; the soil he said was not particularly marked by fertility, but it was a \"pleasant\" land of woods and meadows, and abundant streams. None of it was cultivated, for the people were but poor wanderers, men and women alike naked and untaught, with no houses, and only the rudest of shelters, unacquainted with bows and arrows, but clever in the use of the spear; adroit in the management of their very primitive canoes \u2014 a people not unamiable or without intelligence, yet low in the scale of the human family. In his second famous voyage Cook saw no part of Australian territory, and in his third, though he called at Tasmania and landed near Mount Wellington, it was only a passing visit. He was in a hurry to reach Behring Strait, which it was his design to pass before the winter came on ; but in spite of his haste he found it already blocked with ice, and retired to the Sandwich Islands to await the coming of another spring, a season he was destined never to see, for there at Hawaii the great navigator lost his life, in an unfortunate brawl among the good humoured natives of the island. Cook has no claim to be reckoned the absolute discoverer of any part of Australia, but he chanced to see the most favourable part of it. He stayed much longer on its shores than any previous explorer ; the work he did was infinitely more thorough and satisfactory than any done before his time, and therefore it is that his name in popular estimation is so closely connected with Australian discovery, more closely than those even of De Ouiros, Tasman, and Dampier. The French captain, Marion, called at Tasmania on his way to New Zealand in 1772, and in the same year Captain Furneaux, who took command of the Adventure in Cook's second voyage, being driven by a storm away from Cook's ship, the Resolution, visited the same coast on his way to the place appointed as the rendezvous of the two ships. But neither of these commanders added anything but a few names, as they explored no part of the coast that had not been already mapped out by Tasman. Furneaux was delighted with the land he saw round about the present site of Hobart\u2014 the soil was fine, the forests were <^rand, but the people of wretched condition. He hazarded the unlucky guess that there was no strait dividing Tasmania from the mainland."], [29, "THE EARLY DISCOVERERS OF AUSTRALLA. 9 The year 1788 was a memorable one for Australia, for then arrived its first white inhabitants, seven hundred convicts, with three hundred free people to look after them. The formation of a permanent settlement at Sydney not only made the exploration of these seas more important, but also attracted ships, and by furnishing them with a convenient base of operations made the process in every way easier. Accordingly it is from that time we must date the detailed and complete survey of our coasts. In 1789 Captain Bligh had navigated the perilous passage of Torres Straits in that whaleboat to which he had been consigned by his mutinous crew of the Bounty, and, acting on the information he supplied, the British Government gave him instructions to thoroughly survey the channel on the occasion of his going a second time to Tahiti for breadfruit in his ship, the Providence. This he did with great care and skill in 1792, and it is notable that in his ship sailed Matthew Flinders, then a lad who learnt the higher branches of the art of navigation from a competent master, and was destined to do more than any man for the complete survey of the Australian coasts. In that same year, 1792, the French admiral, D'Entrecasteaux, who was sent out in quest of the ill-fated La Perouse, came in sight of Cape Leeuwin, and followed the coast eastward. For hundreds of miles he sailed along those frowning cliff's of the great Australian Bight \u2014 so bare, so barren, so monotonous. There was nothing there to discover, and he could only corroborate the chart of the Dutch, who a century before had skirted the same coast. Had he but pursued his course a little further, very different would have been his experience; but he was in want of fresh water, and saw none on that crossed over to Tasmania, and left the exp to more determined navigators.

He therefore iloration of South Australia In the previous year a portion of this same coast had been seen by the English sailor Vancouver, who discovered and named King George's Sound.' But he was on his way to the North Pacific on a special mission ; and being constantly blown off the coast by gales, he abandoned the lengthy task of exploring these shores, and held his course for North America. In 1793 arrived the man who was destined to make the coasts of Australia thoroughly known to mankind. Matthew Flinders, after returning from his voyage with Bligh, had his imagination filled with the fascinating scenes of Torres Straits, and his mind aglow with the ambition of being renowned in the history of exploration. In all probability it seemed but a romantic dream to his friends; yet as the first step towards his purpose he obtained a place as 1 Flinders lxix. Vol. I. C"], [30, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 10 midshipman on board of the Reliance, when she sailed from England to carry Captain Hunter out to the colony of which he had just been appointed the second Governor. The surgeon of the Reliance, George Bass, was also ardently in love with ideas of exploration, and on their voyage out the two young fellows struck up a very warm friendship. When the Reliance anchored in Sydney Harbour these friends made a compact that together they should make a detailed exploration of the eastern coast of Australia, which Cook had only followed at some distance; but when they spoke of this proposal it was thought to be only an idle ambition, and there was no encouragement given them; not even an open boat could be borrowed for their purpose. But they purchased a dingy, a little tub of eight feet long; they secured a boy adventurous enough to join them, and the first holiday they got they stood out to sea. The little craft, which they called the Tom Thumb, crept round the South Head, past Coogee and Bondi Bays, and so into Botany Bay, of which they made a chart with that care and accuracy for which Matthew Flinders has always been distinguished, and remarkable in view of the fact that he had no instruments of any sort but a pocket compass. When this excellent piece of work was brought back as the result of their three days' holiday, the naval officers were less discouraging, and not long after Captain Hunter gave the two young men a longer holiday to search for a river said to fall into the sea south of Botany Bay.' But they had no assistance allowed them. They ventured out for a tolerably long voyage, on the dangerous Pacific, in their little dingy. Three days they sailed along the coast; three evenings they tried in vain to land for a night's rest; they had to sleep at the bottom of their boat as best they could. On the fourth night they got ashore, and found the sand a delicious bed beneath them. They could see no signs of a river, and turned for Sydney; the wind was against them. They had terrible work rowing against a stiff gale ; and the fifth night set in wild and dark. The sea rose and lashed the feet of the gloomy cliffs, and for two hours they were close in upon the rocks in absolute darkness, guided as to their course only by the hoarse roar of the surf. At last came a point they found it desperate work to weather, and their exertions could be continued but a little longer, when, on rounding the foam-lashed rocks, they found themselves in a calm recess, where they dropped the stone that served them for an anchor, and lying silent and thankful heard the storm whistle overhead, harmless so far as they were concerned. In the morning they explored and made a chart of Port Hacking, the inlet they had thus accidentally discovered; and after two days of hardship, but without adventure, glided safely through the Heads again into Sydney Harbour, where their pluck and skill won them hearty applause. Up to this time no mariner had ever beheld the shores of Victoria, except that mile or two west of Cape Howe that had dimly been seen by Cook. While almost all the rest of the Australian coast had been seen and roughly drawn, Tasmania had been only very slightly explored, and Victoria not at all. The first to enter on this work was George Bass. He had to enter on it singly, for, to his great regret, Flinders had to go in the Supply on a long voyage and missed the chance he had so longed for. During his absence, Bass obtained the loan of a good whaleboat and a crew of six seamen, together with provisions for six weeks. He sailed south along the coast ; discovered the Shoalhavcn River ; explored Jervis Bay, which had been seen from a distance and named by Captain Cook ; discovered Twofold Bay ; rounded Cape Howe ; and being then in want of fresh water, landed on the Ninety-Mile Beach of Gippsland, the first white man that ever trod Victorian soil. 3 Flinders xcviii."], [31, "THE EARLY DLSCOVERERS OF AUSTRALLA. 11 The opinion he gave of the country shows the unreliability of the first impression given by coast scenery. To his eyes it was all poor and sandy and barren. Little did he guess the Gippsland loveliness that lay but a few miles behind the sterile fringe upon the coast. For a time he sailed along that interminable beach, not ninety but 140 miles in length, till there loomed up in the misty west that great hummocky mass, then thought to be an island, but afterwards named by Bass, Wilson's Promontory. Here a wild gale drove him off\" the shore. He lost sight of land. For three perilous days and three awful nights they stood before the wind, dreading ever the unknown fate that should with horrid suddenness crash their open boat in pieces and leave them struggling in an angry ocean. But they had the good fortune to avoid all the rocks and islets that stud these waters, and though the boat was with difficulty saved from being swamped during the New Year's Eve of 1798, yet they weathered all dangers; and on 4th January, with returning fine weather they bore up to the north, and again caught sight of the Victorian coast. The entrance to a broad inlet was in view. They sailed into it, and found it partly filled by two islands. Here they landed and repaired the boat, which had been sadly knocked about; found the soil good but light ; on the mainland they found the grass luxuriant, and in the deep rocks of the forest were delighted by the abundance of ferns and the wealth of mosses. But Bass had started with only six weeks' provisions. He had now been out for seven weeks, and several more would be required for returning. With reluctance, therefore, he was forced to head his boat for Sydney. The night of 18th January was a wild one, and behind the partial shelter of Cape Liptrap they rode out the gale that blew with violence from the east. Next day they crept up behind the safer shelter of Wilson's Promontory, and there had to linger a week on short rations. That week the ardent Bass spent in ex ploring the promontory, whose great granite mass, the southernmost point of Australia, he considered worthy to be the foundation-stone of a great continent. He climbed among its rocks and dwarf gums to the highest point, 2000 feet above sea level, and thence surveyed one of the most charming prospects of Australia. All the grand panorama of Gippsland and its mountains ; the coasts, the seas, the rocky islets, lay beneath him ; and there, on the opposite side from his boat, he saw a wide bay to which he gave the name of Corner Inlet. His was the first eye that looked with the prescience of civilization on the scene of so much labour and prosperity that was to be. When the easterly gales had abated he brought his boat round the promon tory, noting the four Glennics as he"], [32, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 12 passed, and entered Corner Inlet to explore it. It was a great shallow expanse, left almost all dry at the ebb of tide. He soon had marked it out roughly on his chart and started once more for home. A rough gale caught him ere he could reach Cape Howe, and he risked running his boat ashore on the Gippsland beach. When the weather abated he was over three weeks in rounding Cape Howe and reaching Sydney, thus concluding the most marvellous exploit of maritime history. Shipwrecked mariners have performed long voyages in open boats, and thanked their fortune if they stood at length upon solid earth. But here was a young man who, deliberately and solely out of the ardour of his nature, left that solid earth which mankind in general prefer to keep under them, and trusted himself out on an unknown and stormy sea in an open boat. He had not made safety his one object, but had explored and mapped, and on a dangerous coast had run into a hundred perils unknown to those who rock only on the open ocean. It was a gallant and glorious feat, George Bass ! It was a conspicuous example of what a great soul will dare in order to promote the cause of human knowledge, and the world has been sadly unmindful of your name and your fame. In especial, have we Victorians failed in kindly recognition of the services of our first explorer. You bore your life in your hand, and half-fed, half-drowned, with your six stout-hearted comrades sat at the tiller of that wildly tossing boat through dangerous days and anxious nights, and so, for the first time added the outline of half our coasts to the sum of geographical science. When Bass got back to Sydney his friend had returned, and, eager for discovery, had volunteered to join a vessel that was sent down to Furneaux Island to search for the crew of a shipwrecked vessel. On his return his earnest entreaty was granted, Matthew Flinders for the first time was in command of a vessel. It was the Norfolk sloop of twenty-five tons, in which he was commissioned to sail round Tasmania, if it should prove to be indeed an island. He asked to be allowed to associate Bass with him, and the request was granted. How exultant must the friends have been as the sloop lay over beneath a joyous breeze that bore them rapidly south along the coast to Cape Howe in a staunch and well-found little ship. They crossed over to the north shores of Tasmania, which they carefully explored; entering the long recess of Port Dalrymple for the first time, and making an elaborate chart of its manifold bays and windings; round Cape Grim along the grand but formidable west coast, till they reached the place where Tasman's chart began; then round the South cape, and up the eastern shore, till past Maria Island they again picked up the unseen coast, and explored it till they reached their starting-point: thus for the first time sailing round Tasmania, and settling the long-vexed point as to its insular character. Then they sailed for Sydney with their charts; and the name of Bass was justly given to that strait which he had twice sailed through. In 1799, the following year, Bass found it necessary to return to England, and Flinders, ardent as ever, persuaded Governor Hunter to lend him the Norfolk again, and in her he carefully examined the east coast north of Sydney, going as far as Hervey Bay. This was done so well and wisely that Matthew Flinders was clearly marked out as the man to underdake a task that must sooner or later be undertaken, the complete delineation of the Australian coasts with minuteness enough to serve the purposes of navigation: in short, vague sketches were to be superseded by Admiralty charts. Accordingly, in 1801 we find him in London, preparing the Investigator, of 334 tons, for this important service, to which the English Government had appointed him, giving him the well-earned rank of commander. She carried a crew of eighty-three men, an astronomer, a naturalist, a landscape painter, a natural history painter, a gardener to gather plants and bring them back"], [33, "THE EARLY DISCOVERERS OF AUSTRALIA. 13 alive to England, and a miner to report as to mineral wealth. A pleasant voyage brought them all safely to Cape Leeuwin on 7th December, 1801. They spent five months in making a very careful chart of all the south coasts of Australia, and then made for Sydney Harbour, there to rest and refit. Being there joined by the Lady Nelson, to whose commander, Lieutenant Murray, he had brought instructions to that effect, Flinders continued his examination along the east coast, round Cape York, into the Gulf of Carpentaria, five months being thus consumed. Here the carpenter reported that the Investigator was so far decayed that in a strong gale she must founder, and that to continue the voyage in her would be very unwise. To Flinders this news came as a sad blow; and as he had a great quantity of valuable work on board, and many lives under his charge, he felt himself almost in duty bound to carry the ship back to Sydney. But to see the dearest wish of his heart frustrated was a painful trial. He would struggle on; and for five months more, trusting to the chance of fine weather, he went on with his work, and had half finished the northern coasts, when the condition of the ship and the ill-health of the crew compelled him to turn. He first made for Timor to obtain fresh water and provisions from the Dutch there; then held his course as smartly as possible to Port Jackson, round Cape Leeuwin. A number of the crew died on their way round of exhaustion, and the effects of a close ship and an unhealthy climate. The Investigator was surveyed and condemned ; and Flinders resolved to return to England with the results of his labours, in the hope of securing a second vessel to complete his task. He took his passage along with his officers in the Porpoise, which, accompanied by the Cato and Bridgewater, sailed in August, 1803. The three ships proposed to proceed by Torres Straits, but to avoid the dangers of the great Barrier Reef they stood well out to sea on their way thither; yet they had the misfortune to steer straight on a small reef two hundred miles from land. It was night; the Porpoise was leading; a fresh breeze was blowing, but the sea was clear; when suddenly the roar of breakers was heard, and, with scarce a minute's warning, the vessel struck ; her masts fell, and so sudden was the ruin that not a gun could be fired to warn the other ships. The Cato immediately after ran high on a pointed coral reef, and all but her forecastle was at once destroyed. The other vessel barely succeeded in shearing off, and as a high sea was running she stood far off from danger. The shipwrecked sailors spent a night of anxiety, but at daybreak found a small sandbank half-a-mile off. Partly by the boats, partly by swimming, they mostly succeeded in reaching this place of safety, but a few were drowned in the attempt. The captain of the Bridgewater next morning, fearing to again approach that dangerous quarter, held on his course and left his comrades to their fate. After spending some days on the sandbank, and, saving whatever they could from the Porpoise, it was agreed that Flinders, with the cutter, should return to Sydney for assistance. He successfully carried this small craft, overloaded with fourteen persons, a distance of seven hundred and fifty miles. A ship was sent with the required assistance to the shipwrecked people; but Flinders was allowed to take a small schooner, the Cumberland, of twenty-nine tons, for his own use, so that he might go on at once for England. What an hour of joy for the shipwrecked seventy on the reef when the relieving ships appeared on the horizon! What a cheer rang out as they ran up under the lee of the bank ! All were either carried to Sydney or joined the little Cumberland. This minute vessel had a formidable voyage before her; and as she could take but a small supply of water and provisions, Flinders was forced to call at several ports on his way. Among other places he"], [34, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 14 unluckily put in to Mauritius, where the governor made him prisoner. The treatment he experienced was excessively unjust ; for Flinders carried a passport from Napoleon, directing French officers to offer no hindrance, but rather assist him in his work as it was intended for the benefit of the human race. But the governor, on the pretence that this document referred solely to the Investigator, and could not be supposed to apply to the Cumberland, shut up the luckless navigator in prison, and kept him there for six years, although all his own officers protested against such arbitrary conduct. In 1810, when the expedition of General Abercrombie was preparing to descend upon the island, which indeed it subsequently captured, the governor gave him release, but without his papers. He returned to England at the end of that year, having been absent in all nine years. But these years had been years of toil and suffering; and the effects of ungenerous treatment for six years in a hot climate, and in an unhealthy town, had left him in a most unsatisfactory state of health. He was only fifty years of age, but worn and spent. He husbanded the remains of his strength to prepare his charts and journals for publication. Three and a-half years were spent upon the task, and then on 19th July, 1814, appeared in three large volumes, the results of his labours. Alas, that was also the day of his own decease ; he passed away, with his work completed, but with no share of gratification in the applause which has since then greeted them. His great work made the coasts of Australia as well known and as safe as almost an}- in the world. There, for the first time, was a faithful outline set forth of our Victorian shores. As for Bass, not being a professional seaman, he had turned to mercantile enterprises. He had greatly served the settlement at Sydney by procuring a cargo of pork from Tahiti.6 And in 1803, while his friend Flinders was busy with his work in the Investigator , he sailed from Sydney to visit South America, there to obtain cither alpacas or guanacos, which he proposed to acclimatise in Australia. From that point all trace is lost of the gallant Bass; and the industry of a zealous admirer of his services such as Mr. Rusden, has utterly failed to bring to light any further particulars of his life. But it is to be noted that the Spaniards were at that time only nominally at peace with England, and indeed declared war only next year; that they were excessively jealous of foreign intrusion into their South American possessions ; that Governor King expressed himself strongly at this time in reference to the dangers of trade upon the South American coast. So that on the whole we arc not unreasonable in yielding a willing ear to that rumour which reports him to have been captured, and to have spent the dreary years of lingering life in the slavery of the Peruvian silver mines. The labours of these two worth)- friends carried well towards completion the work that Tasman and Cook had courageously begun, and with them must their names be for ever associated. In after years, Phillip, Parker, King and Wickham and Stokes and Blackwood carried the Admiralty surveys round the remaindei of the north and all the west coasts which Flinders had been unable to examine; but their work, though accomplished with high professional skill was comparatively unromantic, and without that dash and intrepidity which make the work of Bass and Flinders so attractive. ' Rusden's History of Australia, Vol. I., p. 418."], [35, "ABORIGINALS IN CAMP. CHAPTER II. \u0152be Hboriginal Eva. TRULY savage race can have nothing that we may narrate as history. We may gather from them a few stories of individual exploits, or of tribal struggles, but these are without continuity, and each small tribe supplies its little share of incidents that are purely local and temporary. It is only when such a degree of civilization is reached that the race becomes welded into a solid nation ; when wandering tribes consolidate and own some unifying authority, that we can tell its story as a history. Hence it is not out of egotism, or from a contempt for his sable predecessors, that the Australian colonist dates the commencement of the history of his country from the arrival of the first white men. For, indeed, there is no history anterior to that occurrence. The thousands upon thousands of picturesque and not unamiable men and women who spread over all these lands, and formed their homes for untold centuries beneath our forests, have left not a trace for the historian to dwell on, of the time before the settlement of the European. They have left material for the antiquarian, their bygone ages may offer scope to the geologist, but of history they have none. And yet the story of Victoria is incomplete unless we have a notion of the condition of the land and its people before the white man chose it for his home. The larger part of the area of the colony was naturally of an open park-like nature, generally well grassed, and tolerably level. In many places these pleasant glades, where the trees grew thicker, passed insensibly into the sombre forest, where league upon league of rustling gum trees waved in lonely stillness while the ages passed like a dream. Through these the savage passed, but in them rarely made his home. Still less did he penetrate the awful recesses of the mountain ridges crowned with giant gums, and protecting in their silent hollows the nestling fern-tree groves, the haunt of lyre-bird and the shyest of four-footed creatures."], [36, "16 VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. He camped by the river side on the open lands, where game was plentiful and hunting easy. But his presence was hardly a feature in the scene. Over all this colony not five thousand found a home. In little tribes of a hundred persons, rarely more and generally less, they scarcely were a noticeable element in the vast forests. A single tribe of a hundred was lost in the immensity of the territory it called its own, and guarded with jealous exclusiveness. If three or four such tribes formed a confederacy, their lands were equal in extent to the whole of Ireland, and if one proposed to communicate with another a journey of several days generally lay before the messenger who passed from his own to the nearest camp. Let us imagine ourselves to be among the pioneers and penetrating the country among the first white men. For day after day we see no sign of human being, but at length, across the lightly timbered lands, we see a quivering column of smoke hard by the line of gum-trees that marks the course of some perennial stream. We advance, and perhaps our presence startles some dusky beauty, who precipitately retires ; there is a commotion audible, and manlier forms appear, with spear in readiness. Imagine that we can make known our friendliness and be admitted to see their homes and the manner of their lives. Here and there among the grass and bushes we can see their frail dwellings ; if it be summer, these are merely screens to break the wind ; made of boughs in the shape of half a dome, and well interlaced with leaves. Though slight, they are not unpleasing in aspect. Yonder is a woman busily weaving the boughs to form her evening screen, and singing some long monotonous chant at her task. But if it be winter, the dwellings are more substantial. Several strong boughs are made to lean on one another so as to form a pyramid or dome, in the centre of which a man may stand at full height. Smaller branches are laid on these, and over them a rain-proof covering of bark and grass and earth completes the roof. An opening is left which faces some rock or other shelter from the wind.1 Our sable friends now hurry from their varied occupations to gaze upon us, and, while they are wondering at our singular appearance, we may have an opportunity of examining theirs. They are men and women of medium height, spare of frame, dark coloured, but by no means black. Their hair is black, but though curly, it has none of the woolly aspect of the negro's. There is a great variety of countenance to be observed. In some, the thick lip and extended nostril give an appearance of ungainliness to the face that suggests unpleasant comparisons with the quadrumanous tribes; and that unfavourable impression is increased by the restless little eye deeply sunken behind a great shaggy ridge of an eye-brow. But alongside of these we may notice many faces that are very passable, and here and there a head that an artist might dream of for weeks. Among the men the elders are by far the most comely. Yonder is an aged chief with snow-white beard; his lips concealed beneath a curtain of white hair; his strongly-marked nose, his keen eye, his ample hair fast whitening likewise, held up by the band of bark that binds his forehead, and perhaps supports a feather or two. He stands in naked dignity: no garment breaks the outline of his lithe and shining limbs, that glisten with an ointment made of emu's fat. Nothing but a string tied round his waist from which hang two little bunches of strips of fur, one in front and one behind. Around his neck, perhaps, there hangs a circlet of teeth, arranged with careful pride, but there his toilet terminates. Take him for all in all as he stands there, from the view of animal grace and fitness, and he is by no means an ignoble creature. Indeed, his aspect has in it many elements of admiration. Yet 1 Dawson's Australian Aborigines, p. 10."], [37, "THE ABORIGINAL ERA. 17 not in all tribes do we see individuals of form so prepossessing; only among those whose lines have fallen in pleasant places, where water is plentiful, and the grass never failing; whence opossums and kangaroos are never driven by drought and the fierce heats of summer. But on the plains, where the arid breath of the north wind makes the Christmas season a time of bareness, and dries from everything its juice, there the savage may, by reason of generations of starvation and suffering, exhibit a poor frame, with spindle-like legs, and an altogether distressed expression, every rib and bone telling the tale of the famine-stricken seasons. The big head with prominent cheek-bones, the shaky knees, and the want of manly spirit, are vastly different from the general comeliness and vigour of the favourable specimen, who, however far below ourselves in the scale of being, is yet admirably in keeping with his life and its surroundings, and contrasts, to his own advantage, with the splitters and shepherds and others of the whites, who live a life as rude as theirs in the depths of the sullen forests, or out on the lonely plains. With the men, we notice that the older the individual the more favourable on the whole is our impression. Not so with the women. These are all perfectly naked, not even the slender apron of the men interfering with the outline of the limbs. But while the young are often comely, the elder are far from charming, and the old are positively repulsive. Yonder is a maiden of ten or twelve years, hiding behind her father; she seems almost full-grown; her limbs are rounded, and her attitude graceful; the bosom full, the head lightly poised, the long black hair falling loosely over her shining shoulders. All but the face is charming. And even that is often pleasant enough when the white and regular teeth are exhibited in a bashful smile, and the downcast eyes look up a moment and glance from their dark recess. But if you turn to this girl's mother, and see what she herself will be when another twenty years have passed over her agile limbs, the view is not so pleasing. The regular teeth have been ground down with coarse fare and rough work: the face has grown flaccid, and the lower lip has fallen ; there are also unsightly wrinkles, and the frame has lost its litheness, while the breasts are long and unpleasant to the view. The same woman at fifty years of age will her almost an outcast among her own look miserably decrepit, and her ugliness will make people. out a premature old age, are to be seen in the time to time killed off, as they grow too helpless A few of these elderly women, dragging camp, but the most miserable specimens are from Vol. I.

But so far as we can see on the surface, these children of the woods are capital company. They are now, we may suppose, in good condition: and things have been going well with them. There are frequent peals of a loud, jolly laughter; like children, they delight in little practical jokes, and simple things tickle their fancy till they roll with laughter. Here come a couple of late hunters who have wandered further than usual. They march into the encampment, throw down the opossums they have captured, or, better still, the wallaby or kangaroo they have succeeded in stalking and spearing. As evening draws on the fires are stirred up, and fresh wood applied to prepare the evening meal. The viands come forth from the larders of the various mi-mias or dwellings. It may be cranes, or emus, or native companions; or it may be ducks and geese, and wild swans ; perhaps the bandicoot, the wombat, the native bear and the flying squirrel may be seen ready for cooking; or a few rats, a few cockatoos and parrots, with smaller birds, may be laid out by the fire in readiness. A dainty dish may consist of a snake or two, and a few fish ; or it may be a tortoise, and its eggs ; or some favourite emu eggs, or a basketful of eels. All the living things of the woods around them enter into their bill of fare, and the males of the tribe have learnt to trap or spear or unearth all the furred and feathered and finned inhabitants of the forests. Here come some women bringing their vegetable food \u2014 a pile of the pleasant myrnong3 \u2014 in baskets. They look like little parsnips, and beside them are a few other roots of bulbous appearance, with various sorts of fungi and the roots of certain ferns. No ceremony is used as a rule in cooking. The animal is tossed on the red-hot embers, not even the fur or feathers being removed unless they are wanted for other purposes. But, when they are so inclined, they are adroit enough in cooking, and are able to prepare a duck, a fish, or an opossum with a succulence and flavour not surpassed in the average kitchen of the white races. They have no utensils, and no means of building proper ovens ; but they hollow out the ground, line the cavity with stones or dried clay, light on these a glowing fire ; and when the floor and walls are at a hissing heat they withdraw the embers and drop in a thin layer of wet grass. On this is laid the meat to be cooked ; and to keep it clean a few handfuls of grass are sprinkled on top. The whole is then filled in, first with stones, then with earth, and allowed to seethe until the cooking process is complete. Then the covering is removed, and there, reposing in whirling wreaths of steam, lies the dainty dish deliciously cooked. But, as a rule, this process is too slow for the hungry hunter. He prefers to throw the animal on the embers, perhaps staying his appetite by pulling out the entrails when slightly warmed, and eating them while the rest is cooking. When the feast is ready, each man sets himself down beside his own fire, his wife and children sitting behind him. His manner of eating is not dignified ; he tears the meat from the bones with his teeth, and crams great pieces into his open jaws. Occasionally he 'passes a share behind, which his wife or wives receive with a great deal of jabber. They furnish the infants and girls with their meal. As for the boys, if they are over seven or eight years old, they camp with the bachelors, and eat their meal beside the young men's fires. And so for an hour the camp is busy.

As a rule these are eaten at once when they arc taken out of the log, just as tourists cat the oysters one by one from the rocks; but, however they arc eaten, they arc reckoned a choice and dainty morsel. When the family tyrant has gorged himself, and the women have satisfied their own and their children's appetites\u2014 if the food were plentiful enough, or have gone without if the supplies ran short\u2014 there is a time of rest. The fathers of the families lay them down with slightly protuberant paunches ; the women tickle their children and fondle them ; the native dogs snap at the bones that are thrown them, or come up to feed from the women's hands ; then they too lie down by the flickering fire, or wander restlessly in the half-lit gloom. Perhaps at a distance we may hear the sound of jolly laughter, for yonder, round their blazing fire, the gamesome bachelors, who arc bound to camp apart, arc indulging in some practical jokes, and making the unseen glades of the woodland re-echo to their merry peals. But when an hour has been given to rest, the various families intermingle ; the women gather in little knots, the men perhaps enjoy an hour round one of the fires, and talking, boasting, joking, make the time pass pleasantly enough. Or, it may be there is some important matter to discuss. One of the ciders of the tribe rises and addresses the rest. He speaks so loudly that not only the circle at the fire but all the camp may hear him. He speaks with many gesticulations, and rouses his hearers to excitement. Others follow. To us it is all but dumb show, but to them a source of the utmost interest. There is an occasional shout, a good deal of bandying backwards and forwards of short words and jocular expressions ; then one by one they all retire to bed, whither some of the more grumpy members have long ere this betaken themselves. Each fire is arranged, the glowing embers stirred; the little logs neatly placed star fashion with only their ends in the fire, so as to give as much glow and as little flame as possible. A little dry grass is spread underneath the mi-mia, and the dusky forms creep in.' In summer they are naked, unless for the slight strewing of dry grass over their bodies, or the drawing of a small grass mat over their limbs. But in winter they make themselves cosy with rugs. An occasional growl from the men within, or from the dogs without, or perhaps the peevish outcry of a child, is all that disturbs the camp ; but soon even these die out and the scene is silent. The fires in silence glow. The dark cavern-like mi-mias scarcely show the dusky forms slumbering in obscurity, and the most noticeable feature is the group of three or four long barbed spears standing in front of each, ready for the fray should danger arise. But often, as the solemn night wears on, you will perhaps hear ominous sounds and then the long piercing cry of a woman follows \u2014 ya-ki, ya-ki, through the slumbering camp, to tell of some unfortunate wife who has roused the ire of her quick-tempered lord, who perhaps is beating her about the head with his club or wooden pick, or quite as likely has thrust a spear an inch or two into the calf of her leg as a mild piece of discipline.5 Shortly after daybreak they are all afoot, and prepared to make a breakfast of whatever has been left over from the evening's gorge ; or perhaps they have to scatter out and hunt for their morning meal. Very possibly they may have already found the game growing scarce in the neighbourhood, and so resolved on the previous evening to move forward. In that case the tribe prepares to decamp. Their few effects are soon collected. The women slip an opossum *\u2022 Mr. Le Souef's Account of the Natives of Australia, given in Vol. II. of Brough-Smyth's work. 5 A. C.

Into this the mother lifts her infant, swinging it over her shoulders.0 She has also her basket of woven bark, of which every woman carries at least one, to sling on behind upon her back. Then with a piece of lighted bark in one hand as a fire-stick, with which to make a fire at the evening's camp, and perhaps with a bark vessel in the other containing a supply of water for the march, she is ready for the road. But if any food or domestic implements are to be carried, beneath that burden also she has to bend ; and it is not unlikely that if she has another child of tender years too young to walk, she may have to find a place somewhere for that other burden, and stagger along under a load suitable for a small horse. But as with ourselves, so with the blacks; there is a wide diversity of temperaments. On a market night in one of our cities you may see one wife staggering under the weight of both baby and basket and bundles, while her husband strolls on with hands in pocket and pipe in mouth ; and yet another wife trips lightly and happily along beside her more considerate husband, who has taken the burdens as his share. So you will see many of these native fathers shine out in pleasant contrast to their fellows. Yonder good-natured man, with his babe seated stride legged upon his shoulder, is one of the more agreeable sort ; his wife keeps by his side and he helps her with her burden, while they lighten the road with friendly chat. Still, as a rule, the man stalks on ahead bearing only his spears and other weapons, while the woman, at a distance behind, sullenly follows his footsteps, tottering beneath the weight of her load. On their march the men keep a sharp look-out for game ; the emu and the kangaroo they stalk, stealing up towards them against the wind, with spear ready to be launched ; if the game stands in the open, too far from sheltering bushes, a leafy branch is broken and carried in front as a screen till the hunter is within throwing distance. Then at one motion down goes the screen and forth speeds the quivering spear, generally with a marvellous accuracy.7 Opossums they trace by their marks on the bark of trees, and follow by cutting notches for the support of the great toe ; the native bear also is thus pursued and dragged from his shelter-place. The wombat is either dug out or driven from his underground recess. A multitude of little contrivances are adopted for the capture of smaller game, and with such address that in a forest where a European would of necessity starve, the aboriginal can live in plenty. Wild ducks are caught in a manner indicating the singular boldness and delicacy of the native hunter's operations. Silently entering the river above the spot where the covey is busily engaged, he drops down with the current, only an inch or so of his face being exposed. When near enough he dives, and silently stealing under the ducks from below whips one or two of them under water, where they are at once killed.\" The natives are expert in netting birds and fish, but they use nothing resembling the hook and line. These avocations, however, are best carried on when the camp is stationary. Then the whole tribe starts to spend the day in hunting. An hour or two after sunrise,\" the women set out from the camp in single file, with sticks in hand, and often followed by a line of yelping dogs ; they spend four or five hours in digging up roots, and catching shrimps or rats. When they return, the men leave the camp to follow the more arduous toils of the chase; while the women settle down in the camp, and proceed to weave their baskets out of rushes or strips of bark, or to sew together the skins of opossums, by means of the sinews of the tail of the kangaroo. 6 Dawson, p. 39.

Le Souef, p. 298. \u00bb Curr, p. 255."], [41, "THE ABORIGINAL ERA. 21 The men on their return, as they straggled back in twos or threes with the spoils they had won, would perhaps lounge; or mend the weapons they had injured in their hunting. For that purpose they had a number of implements\u2014 most precious the greenstone axe, formed of a wedge-shaped piece of greenstone, fastened by strips of skin or by sinews into a cleft at the end of a hardwood handle, the joint being nearly covered by a cement made of gum and mussel shell lime. But these utensils were rare, and a tribe could generally boast the possession of only one or two. They were used to cut the notches when climbing trees in pursuit of opossums, which, on the whole, used to form the mainstay of the aboriginal diet. Knives and scrapers they possess, but these are merely splinters of flint and obsidian, or merely sharpened shells; and bradawls are easily made by sharpening the leg-bones of various animals. With these primitive weapons the naked hunter sits down to cut and polish and sharpen his weapons. First he must have his spears in order; for he carries three or four, or perhaps as many as six ; each for a special purpose. His war-spear10 is a long splinter of hardwood rounded and smoothed. The point of one is hardened in the fire, and ground down on a stone till it is as sharp as a wooden spear-head can be made, and on one side the wood is nicked for six or cio*ht inches. In another spear, a row of sharp pieces of flint or obsidian will be inserted by means of the cement they make of gum and lime. But the hunting spear is shorter, rarely reaching seven feet in length. It is sometimes only a smaller species of war-spear, but more often is formed of a reed with a point of hardened wood, or the sharpened leg-bone of a kangaroo. Then the hunter has to keep his ugly-looking liangle in good order. It is made of a piece of root, or an angle from the branch of a gumtree. One arm is two or two and a-half feet long, and is worked into a comfortable handle ; while the other of six or seven inches in length is sharpened at the point, so as to make a sort of wooden pick. It forms a most formidable weapon at close quarters, and none but a blackfellow's skull could endure a heavy blow with that cruel-looking point. Some of the natives carry what might be called a wooden sword, but it is a very subordinate weapon. The boomerang is more noticeable, being a peculiarly Australian implement, and of properties so singular that not even yet have mathematicians discovered the means by which it succeeds in striking a distant object and then returning to the feet of the thrower. It is made of heavy wood, thin and flat, and bent at an obtuse angle. A very delicate adjustment is made in the curves of its edges, and in the angles of its surface, these being imitated from one boomerang to another and perfected by experiment. The thrower requires much practice in its use, but when proficient, is able to kill a duck on the water without fear that the implement will be lost in the stream or lake beneath. Or in fight, he may heavily scar an opponent's cheek or skull, and find his weapon a couple of seconds later lying almost within his grasp again. Clubs of various sorts are in constant use, and the native keeps his hand in practice by using them freely on his wife, his children, and his dogs. A well-equipped native has two shields, 10 Dawson, p. 87."], [42, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLLS: PAST AND PRESENT. one a light oblong piece os wood, only about nine inches wide, though between two and three feet long; it is used only for intercepting spears. The other is a heavy wooden block, presenting the appearance of a triangular prism with one of the edges facing to the front; but above and below it tapers to a point, while in the side that faces to the rear, a hole is dug with a handle for the left hand. With this the native wards off the stout blow of the liangle or the heavy club. To keep these weapons in good order after the necessarily rough work of the chase employs such of the evening hours as the native ma)' not prefer to spend in lounging and chatting. These are the usual occupations of the camp; but the young folks make the time merry with their games, in which the elders do not always disdain to join. The boys make for themselves a ball of opossum skin, which they employ in a game of football.\" The girls play games with strings upon their fingers,\" or fondle odd-shaped pieces of wood as dolls, and dress them in opossum skins. The boys practise throwing their spears at a disk of bark trundled through the grass before them. Romping of many sorts makes the camp merry at times; and in warm weather, if a river is at hand, the laughter of the women and children resounds amid the splashing of the joyous bath. As a rule, the ordinary life of the tribe presented an outside appearance of very considerable happiness; the parents were ridiculously indulgent to their children, the women accepted their dependent position as a matter of course, and for the most part acted the part of willing and often enough cheerful slaves. But on probing a little beneath the external surface, the true state of affairs was more open to question. There is the utmost apparent discrepancy between the reports of different witnesses as to the general moral condition of the blacks. But the inconsistent accounts are mostly due to the very different standards that have been set up. One writer has compared the aboriginal ideal of right and wrong with the vastly higher ideal of his own people; accordingly he condemns the natives unsparingly. Another is content to weigh their general lives against the practice of the lower classes of our own countrymen, and pronounces the one not inferior to the other. And so two travellers, both writing the truth as they saw it, may tell two tales as contradictory as they could be made. There is no doubt the aboriginal took great pains to comply with his own standard of morality, but that standard was hopelessly inconsistent with our own. To look on the face of his mother-in-law was a heinous sin in his eyes, scarcely to be tolerated, and accordingly he was at the utmost trouble to avoid seeing or hearing her;'3 but he was at perfect liberty to dash out the brains of two or three of his children if he saw fit, and no one in the camp would have dreamt for a moment of stigmatising such an act as wicked. Men and women discovered not even the most rudimentary sense of shame at being absolutely naked ; but no man would hold his head up again if he had ever done anything so abominably wicked as to marry a girl of his own tribe instead of stealing or buying one of another tribe. It is therefore clear that to judge these people by our standard is unwise. We must be content to look upon their customs, their moral notions, as so many biological facts, without presuming to try them by laws which they do not own and have never dreamt of. To begin with, they have a wholly different estimate from our own of the value of human life. To us, that is in our highest developments, human life is perfectly sacred. The black forbore to kill another only so long as he had no particular desire to kill him. He would be good-humoured, \" Dawson, p. 85. \" Curr, p. 280. 13 Brough-Smyth, I., 95; Bonwick's Buckley, p. 26; Le Souef in Brough-Smyth, II., 291 ; Dawson, p. 32."], [43, "THE ABORLGLNAL ERA. 23 kind, self-denying sometimes, to those whom he had an inclination to please, but he was in no wise bound to pay the least respect to human life. If he felt inclined to lessen his family, he picked out the child that he liked least and either knocked its brains out against a tree and burnt the body, or else he dug a hole and with no compunction buried the little creature in it alive. Very possibly, after it was all over, and the piercing screams of the poor little picanniny had died down and become for ever hushed, a tide of purely animal affection might flow over him. He would then sit down and weep, as a child might lament over a broken toy, but in an hour it would be all forgotten, and none in the tribe would trouble himself further about the matter. As a rule the mothers themselves were the instigators of murder. They o*0t permission from their lords, and either slew the little things with their own hands, or, perhaps, found the fathers so ready to comply that, without the trouble of words, he rose and seized the babe forthwith, and in a minute all was over. All writers on the aboriginals agree that this was the custom. Those who treat of the Victorian natives consider that at least one half of the children were thus disposed of, and some place the estimate as high as two-thirds. The body of the poor little child was occasionally, though not as a rule, eaten by the family, the mother partaking in a repast that to our notions is the most disgusting that can be conceived. Indeed it is freely allowed by all recent writers on the subject, that the natives of Victoria were cannibals, not in a ferocious manner, but often enough out of friendship. We are told on good authority that the most perfect method of mourning for a deceased friend was to eat his body; but even on the same page we observe that they had an idea of its being an agreeable repast; for the body of a plump young woman is singled out as being the most suitable for the purpose, and of all parts of the body the palms of the hands were regarded as the greatest delicacies. All these and similar facts are now beyond dispute, and they at once indicate the impassable gulf that lay between their conscientious feeling and our own. But a man had not only a right to massacre some or all of his children if he liked, but it was his undoubted privilege to brain or spear his wife if he so pleased; and if he chose to kill another man's wife, he had to give up his own as an equivalent if he had one, or if he could not make good the loss of the aggrieved party, he had to allow some sort of retaliation on the part of the man who had suffered a loss. If a man found that his aged father or mother, but more especially the latter, was a burden on him, he very readily resolved on death as the easiest mode of ridding himself of a difficulty. He obtained the concurrence of his tribe, and the aged being was struck from behind when unawares, or was seized and placed upon a well-piled fire. The tribe looked on in a certain awe at the torments of the wretched victim, and when death was come they abandoned the encampment and never visited it again.\" But it seems that as a general rule the victim was mercifully strangled before being burnt. It is very difficult to determine how far the Australians should be regarded as honest in their habits. Some observers have remarked that they were singularly honest. Others have lamented the total want of honesty they exhibited. The truth seems to be that they had no idea of any abstract obligation to honesty, but that in practice they were not to any marked extent dishonest ; very possibly because they had little inducement to dishonesty. There could be little temptation to steal when the possessions of individuals were so few and so generally within attainment by honest means ; and the hungry man who should appropriate his neighbour's game, must lay his account for a fight or possibly a sudden blow on the head at some subsequent and unexpected moment from the injured party. Hence robbery from a warrior or \" Dawson, p. 62; Curr, 266."], [44, "VLCTORLA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 24 from his wife was not an advantageous process. But a man had no need to rob a weaker person, simply because the weaker knew it to be best for his own interest to surrender without complaint whatever the stronger wished for. The different tribes scrupulously respected each other's hunting grounds ; but judging from their habitual treachery and the savagery with which a stray individual of one tribe was generally butchered when he was met by members of another tribe, this custom was due more or less directly to fear, and not to any special feeling of considerateness. But, whatever be the cause, it seems certain that among themselves, and in the bosom of their own tribes, the natives were little troubled by thefts. In regard to lying the same difficulty arises, that in their daily lives there was little occasion for it ; and therefore their general honesty of word seemed somewhat admirable to the observer ; yet it was generally noticed that truthful habits prevailed only because lies were no wise necessary, and that they had no idea of any intrinsic wrong in lying. If circumstances arose in which it suited the purpose of a native to deny the truth, he did so with a simplicity and directness which showed that he recognized no exterior arbiter of his acts, and had an undoubted right to utter or conceal the truth exactly as it suited him. In fact, he felt himself as free from responsibility in respect to truth as belligerent armies do among civilized nations, when it is generally judged to be entirely within a man's own discretion whether to tell the truth or to lie to his enemy. The comparatively low standard of feeling that prevailed among them is perhaps best seen in connection with the position that women held in their estimation. Whatever variations might occur through individual affections, there cannot be a doubt that a woman was regarded as a possession. When a little girl she was the possession of her father, who generally bartered her for some girl of a neighbouring tribe, to be handed over to him eventually as his wife ; or, if he had enough of wives, he otherwise exchanged the little maiden for his own profit, and that as soon as she became an exchangeable commodity, about the age of twelve. She was not married, but handed over, or sold to be the property of a man of a neighbouring tribe ; who could deal with her as with any of the rest of his property.15 If she ran away from him he had the right to kill her; if he pleased, he could exchange her at any time for the wife of another man. Two young men could exchange their sisters; two old men would sometimes exchange their daughters, and so each obtain a wife. The men did not, as a rule, shirk a fair share of the work of providing food ; but they could do so if they pleased, for the women were their absolute slaves, to be treated just as they thought fit ; and a lazy fellow, if so he chose, might do nothing himself but see that his wives worked hard enough. A man was at liberty to have as many wives as he could acquire, but the number was generally not great, for the rule was woman for woman, and the number of wives he could take to himself was limited by the number of exchanges he could procure. But if the woman had lost her charms and grown beyond the age of usefulness, he would try, perhaps, to palm her off on somebody else, if possible for some sort of an equivalent, and failing that would make a gift of her. However, if no one would accept the unfortunate creature, even on the most liberal terms, he might if he pleased resolve upon her death. He would very likely talk freely of his intention, for nobody would see the least harm in it. If the woman knew of it she might, perhaps, plead for life; but as a rule, knowing how useless were words, she preserved a sullen silence, till at length her owner selected his time. He called forth from the dwelling the unfortunate partner \u25a0*\u2022' Brough-Smyth, Vol. I., p. xxiv."], [45, "THE ABORIGINAL ERA. 25 of whom he was grown weary, and brained her with his club, or sent his spear through her meekly obedient body. The aboriginals had no notion of chastity as an ideal. Promiscuous intercourse was perfectly allowable under many circumstances, and what a man might do or what a woman, was in itself a matter of no concern to anybody. Want of chastity was in no way wrong in itself; it was only when a woman had become the peculiar property of a particular man, and when he made it his business to see that his rights of property were observed, that any question of duty arose. But then it was not out of any regard for virtue, but out of fear for her possessor that the woman was circumspect in her conduct. The men were under no obligations to virtue whatsoever; but they respected the women belonging to other members of the tribe for the same reason as they respected his property \u2014 out of fear for his club and spear. But a man was always at liberty to steal a woman from another tribe and appropriate her if he could. A strong proof of this low ideal of women is afforded by the fact that young men could rarely find wives. It was not till he was nearly thirty that a man could obtain any place in the struggle for women. The old warriors appropriated all that were to be had, and while they had three, four, or five, most of them young enough to be his daughters or granddaughters, a young fellow of two-and-twenty had to remain a bachelor, unless his prowess in the field had so far intimidated his rivals that they shunned a contest with him. For it was a recognised principle that the youth who had no wife was at liberty to challenge the grey-beard who had several. If the challenge was refused, or if the grey-beard was beaten, he had to surrender one of the women to the youthful champion.1\" The result of this way of looking at women was that there were constantly arising quarrels and fights about their appropriation.\" It is thus very evident that there could be no real virtue among these tribes, inasmuch as there was no reverence felt for chastity; but there was a very good imitation of virtue arising from the jealously-guarded property in women that the men assumed. Yet, strange to say, the natives were in strict bondage to a morality of their own which forbade a man to marry any woman of his father's tribe or of his mother's class; and the somewhat intricate rules pertaining to this artificial morality were never relaxed. Though the natives generally roved in small communities, yet a number of these considered themselves to be consanguineous, and to form but a single tribe. In the summer they held their general meetings; messengers moved from one encampment to another, and their news were delivered and received with endless formalities. Provisions were then plentiful, and feasting was possible; a time was fixed, and likewise a place; and for a few nights the camp fires shone thickly over a considerable extent of country. When holding their conferences, the warriors of the various tribes formed a circle round a clear space, and a great deal of vigorous haranguing took place. Sometimes the inquiry would turn on the wrong-doing of some individual, the communities whom he had injured laying their complaints before the warriors of his own community. If his misdeeds were clear, his fellows acquitted themselves of all complicity by compelling him to stand forth, and either receive three spears from the hands of the injured people (a process which from the remarkable agility of these men in avoiding spears was no more than a formality), or perhaps, and this was a more serious matter, he was compelled to stand forth and receive a huge blow on the head from a club wielded by a strong right arm. If the community takes the part of the culprit, or if, for any reason, a feud exists between one camp and another, then the spectacle is offered of a regular tournament. The men face each \"- Dawson, p. 36. \" Le Souef, in Brough-Smyth, Vol. II., 291. E Vol. I."], [46, "26 VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. other and work themselves up into a rage ; the women stand behind yelling and goading the men to fury ; the neutral tribes at a distance look on. Spears and boomerangs whizz through the air ; the light shields are rapidly plied now this way and now that to ward off the incessant shower. When that portion of the fight begins to slacken, the clubs and liangles are prepared. A rush is made to close quarters ; the din of beating and smashing resounds on all sides as heavy blows are deftly received on the wooden shields. The women, too, get into close quarters, and batter each other with their long sticks, till the whole scene becomes maddening ; and the combatants, deaf to everything else, pound madly away. When their strength is exhausted, the neutral tribes step in and put a stop to the fray, and the warriors retire to look after their wounds. It is seldom that deaths occur in such conflicts, but cuts and bruises are abundant. Probably when evening has come the two communities are again on the best of terms. Feasting, or rather gorging, goes on all day long, so far as the provisions permit ; and during the day wrestling matches, or trials of skill, keep the men amused. Perhaps, in the evening, there is to be a wedding. A girl of one tribe, who has been promised to a man of another, is handed over with due ceremony. But the great delight of these tribal gatherings was undoubtedly the public dance or corrobboree. This was always performed after dark, and by one community at a time, each taking an evening for the display of its own accomplishments. During the day, the men who are to dance at night bedeck themselves in the most gorgeous style. Red patches of clay are spotted over their faces and bodies, and staring lines of white are drawn with pipeclay along their ribs and down the middle of each limb. A bunch of leaves is tied round each ankle, so as to rustle at every movement ; and other ornaments, such as double or triple necklaces of teeth, are carefully donned by the youth over his well-greased naked skin. But all these preparations go on in secret, so that when the spectators form their circle in the evening none may know of the treat that is in store. When darkness has fallen, the fire is kindled, and great piles of dry bark are thrown on it till the flames leap high and light the woods with a lurid glare. The audience seat themselves at a little distance, while the women of the tribe that are to perform make a half-circle round the fire and provide the music. They roll up their dry opossum rugs as tightly as they can, and make a peculiar noise by beating on them with open hands; some of them also clash one stick upon another in regular time, while the monotonous strains of some oft-repeated chant are being intoned in unison. The dancers are meanwhile concealed in the dark shadow behind some clump of bushes. Suddenly one glides out, and the dim flicker of the light in part reveals him. He moves his limbs and his body in rhythmic contortion, while the sound of the singers, before subdued and low, now rises with wild and plaintive wail on the evening air. All eyes are fixed on the single performer, when on a sudden, a second figure glides up to his side; the two are scarcely made out to be human forms, but the glaring lines of white reflecting the sombre light, give them the aspect of skeletons abroad for a ghastly frolic. And so a third and a fourth and a fifth glide out and join the row, till all the performers at length are in line. Now stamping the time and brandishing their weapons they advance, as though animated by one single impulse; but again they retire, and all eyes arc fascinated by the weird surroundings of the scene. So alternately advancing ami retiring, they at length move close to the camp fire, and opposite the singing women. The music, if such it can be called, grows wilder and quicker. The line of men, now thirty or forty in number,' stamp more vigorously, and deep guttural sounds in perfect unison come from their labouring"], [47, "THE ABORIGINAL ERA. 27 frames. The muscles of the front of the leg are made to quiver with convulsions that arc terribly exhausting to the frame; and the wave-dike motion down the thigh is of indescribable character. The fire is made to blaze up, and throw in strong relief their frenzied forms; the leaves round their ankles rustic with a noise like the ocean surge ; the voices of the women sound like some infernal incantation, when suddenly the whole line raises its row of spears, and rushes forward as if mad for blood, but with a terrific shout suddenly disbands, and again seeks the depths of the forest. The description given by the poet Gordon M'Crae is true in every detail :\u2014 \"Wild the device and strange the sign That stared in many a snowy line From beaming face and heaving breast And limbs that seldom paused to rest, Whilst all the rib-like lines laid on Made each man seem a skeleton. Nodded the feathers from the red And netted band that bound each head, And hoarsely rustling leaves of trees Shook round dark ankles in the breeze. The singers with their time-sticks rang The cadence of the song they sang, And every face and limb below, And tree above them, caught the glow That spread from lamp-fire's rising blaze, Lighting the yapeen's wond'rous maze Of feet and ankles in the dance, With fitful gleam or twinkling glance.\" When the performance was over, and the dancers had divested themselves of their ornaments, they mingled again in the general crowd. An hour or two passed in discussion and in boasting, and again the camp was still. In the morning games and feats of skill prevailed; in the evening these elaborate dances or long palavers filled up the time till a week or so was gone, and the gathering broke up, each community returning to its proper hunting grounds. So sped their annual gathering. But with the advent of the white man, all this, and even the race itself, were doomed to extinction. It has taken but half-a-ccntury for them to disappear. The vices of the white men, and the interference of regular settlement with the native hunting grounds, have had something to do with their extinction. But it may be surmised that there was no great vitality in a race that could be so easily swept out of existence. The fact that in all the centuries during which they had held these lands, they never became more numerous than the population of a single small town, and that in a land of excellent natural capabilities, which already contains at least two hundred times as many white people as it ever contained black, their scanty numbers remained stationary, would seem to indicate a feebleness in the race that must be largely taken into account in speaking of the causes that have swept it away. They had within themselves two customs which must have made their existence very precarious. Infanticide, and the prevalent custom of indiscriminate revenge, must of themselves have kept their numbers down to so unstable a level, that a very little determining cause would be sufficient to change the condition of equilibrium into one of steady decrease. The practice of infanticide reduced the children of one woman to at the outside three on an average. Now to continue a race at a constant number, a man and woman must leave two children to grow up to adult years in order to replace them; and if they have a family of three the extra one is not more than sufficient to provide for the exigencies of early death by disease and violence. Thus anything like increase must have been nearly impossible; and on the other hand, if their customs barely sufficed to maintain a uniform level, it is plain that a comparatively unimportant influence in an adverse direction would be sufficient to extinguish them, and as there were only four or five thousand in all to be extinguished, the process has not been slow. Next to infanticide, the practice of revenge was most active in keeping their numbers at a low level. No one, according to their belief, died what we call a natural death. Some one must"], [48, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 28 have wrought the destruction of the bod)-, if not by actual violence, then at least by incantations. If violence had been used, then was the taking of vengeance obli- gatory; but if the death was due to incantation, then va- rious spells were consulted to discover what neighbouring tribe or community had by its malignity done the evil. The corpse was stretched out on the grass, and a little trench dug all round. Busy searchers watched to see in what direction the first insect that came from within the little enclosure should cross to lie. this trench, and in that direction was the murderous tribe supposed The men were then bound to go and take the life of someone in that tribe. If they were slow or lazy in undertaking the task, the women by their taunts and wailings stirred them up to ferocity. The warriors, taking a supply of cooked food for several days, set out on their mission. As they approached the enemy's country they were careful to light no fires, and to lurk by day in the dark thickets. When their stealthy eyes had discovered the place where their victims were encamped, they lingered till nightfall ; then, stealing up in silence, they rushed on the slumbering camp. Sometimes they were content to spear the first man or brain the first woman that they met, but oftentimes the thirst for blood woke in them when it could be gratified with impunity. The sleeping tribe were stunned ere they could rise, or rising were slaughtered as they reached for their spears, or if, escaping from the dread scene, they succeeded in gliding into the shadows of the forest, they had there to lurk and listen to the dying screams of wives and children, or hear the moans of their wounded companions who were being turned by the assassins on their faces, while the knife was busily plied on their upturned flanks to cut out the kidneys of the victims. Then, bearing a number of kidneys as trophies of their manly prowess, the sneaking aggressors took their way through the forest. The victim tribe set up a new camp, and in their turn dreamt of some opportunity for future vengeance, whilst the victors returned to their friends to receive congratulations, and rub the kidney fat of the murdered people over their bodies as a sweet unguent; and the tribe partook of the kidneys themselves as morsels delicious for revenge. Such a race, with such customs, could never have been numerous, and in spite of a kindly feeling to them for their good-humoured ways, we can scarcely regret that scenes of lust and bloodshed and cannibalism have come to an end, and that where these hours of midnight diablerie once filled the air with lamentations, there is now the decent little church, or the neat state-school, with human beings that have some ideal to live for, and some justification to plead for their existence."], [49, "THE ABORIGINAL ERA. 29 As to the ethics of the question, there can be drawn no final conclusion. Whether the European has a right to dispossess these immemorial occupants of the soil, or whether it is wricked that he should use his superior might in furthering his own interests at the expense of others, is a problem incapable of absolute determination. It is a question of temperament; to the sentimental it is undoubtedly an iniquity ; to the practical it represents a distinct step in human progress, involving the sacrifice of a few thousands of an inferior race ; he subtracts that as a small drawback to a vast good, and finds the balance enormously on the side of the good. But the fact is that mankind, as a race, cannot choose to act solely as moral beings. They arc governed by animal laws which urge them blindly forward upon tracks they scarce can choose for themselves. If it is a divine law that the Anglo-Saxon people must double themselves every half-century, it must be a divine law that they are to emigrate and form for themselves new homes in waste lands. But every spot suitable for man's sustenance is held by some sort of human occupant; and, therefore, the Anglo-Saxon cannot choose but intrude upon the haunts of other races. When Victoria first felt the tide of immigration, England was peopled far beyond the then existing means of sustenance. Though trades extended and arts improved so as to yield employment for more and more, yet were there two hundred thousand human beings added to her population every year more than she could find food for. Had these stayed at home in deference to the claims which wandering savages might be supposed to have to forests that they merely hunted in, then for every savage so preserved, ten thousand human beings would have had to die by lingering deaths, the proximate causes many, but the ultimate cause the same distress from over-population ; and the gloomy prospects that clouded the horizon in 1830 might have been a catastrophe of desperation in 1850. No Reform Bill could have prevented it. In obedience to natural laws over which they had no control, seeing that they would not and could not brain their infants as the Australians did, the Anglo-Saxons sought these lands, and settled side by side with the natives. Their full justification lies in the fact that they recognized the claims of their sable brethren to subsistence from the soil, and though ruffianly individuals too often sullied the fame of their race by acts of cruelty, yet the wish of the whites as a community always was to secure, or, if necessary, to provide the means of subsistence to the aboriginals. Hence, as our future story will show, the appointment of protectors to guard the persons and rights of the native tribes ; hence the formation of stations wherein the state supports and cares for them. But the altered conditions, which the white man's presence brought, have proved destructive to these poorly recuperative tribes. The vices which purge the civilized community of its inferior organizations, seized like a plague on the natives, and carried them off, as the small-pox did in the earliest years of settlement. Yet the actual hardship inflicted was not great. It was less a case of dying off than of failing to be born. The black man, indeed, paid the ordinary penalty we must all submit to ; if he sadly regretted that he left none to inherit his blood we pity him, but our thoughts travel to the much harder scenes that would have been in city slums of the old world, and we are content with the balance. Yet will there ever cling a pathos round the story of a vanishing race; and when we think of the agile forms that once held dominion over these widely forested lands; when we see them vanishing with terrible speed to be but a memory of the past, the contrast affects our feelings, even though our intellects refuse to be moved, recognizing the working of a law above that which man makes for himself."], [50, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLLS: PAST AND PRESENT. In the first fifteen years of the settlement of the colon)- the natives dwindled away to one-half, and in the next twenty these again dwindled away to a half. Since then they have steadily declined until now not six hundred, even including half-castes, enjoy the easy life provided for them by the state. They arc housed and fed, clothed and educated, at the public charge, yet fail to reproduce their numbers ; and another decade will in all probability bring with it the extinction of the race within Victorian bounds. We should be well content if it had been otherwise, and doubtless the whole five thousand of them would have been welcome to a comfortable home among us, had it so been possible.

Zbe Exploration of the Coasts of Dictovia. the early part of the year 1798, George Bass had roughly examined the eastern half of the Victorian coast in that intrepid boat voyage of his. The charts he had taken to Sydney set forth the main features in a somewhat rude fashion, for he was not a trained seaman, but a surgeon. He had not that knowledge of nautical surveying, nor was he equipped with those nicely-adjusted instruments, which are necessary for even a moderately good outline of an unknown coast. Our admiration for his work is in no way founded on its accuracy or beauty, but rather on the undaunted devotion he displayed in it. Still, in a distorted guise, the eastern coast was laid down in charts that gave a vague idea of the Ninety-mile Beach, of Corner Inlet, Wilson's Promontory, and Western Port. The remaining part of the Victorian shores was plotted down in equally rude fashion by Lieutenant James Grant in the years 1800 and 1801, as the result of his cursory examination on board the Lady Nelson! That diminutive craft was built under the direction of Captain Schanck of the Admiralty, to test the value of an invention of his own, which he called a \"sliding keel.\" This consisted of three centreboards fitted into wells in the vessel, and capable of being dropped so as to form a very deep keel so long as the vessel was on the open sea. This keel being in three portions, it was possible to adjust them so as to improve the sailing qualities of the vessel when the wind was on the quarter. When it was directly abaft these keels were all raised, and the vessel became a flat-bottomed craft. Captain Schanck was friendly with Grant, and secured him the command of this ship when the Duke of Portland had it prepared for use in the exploration of Australian seas. The long rakish-looking schooner hauled out into the Thames on the 13th January, 1800, with a crew The narrative of this voyage was in 1S03 published with the following e The N Voyage of Discovery performed in His Majesty's vessel the Lady Nelson, of sixty tons burtt the years 1800, 1801, and 1802 to New South Wales,\" by James Grant."], [52, "32 VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. of fifteen men, provisioned for nine months. She seemed but a slight craft for so arduous a voyage, and her bulwarks amidships were less than a yard from the water's edge. It is scarcely to be wondered at that Grant found some little difficulty in keeping his crew together, and that it was not till 17th March that he lost sight of the English coast. The instructions he held from the Duke of Portland were to examine the straits between Van Diemen's Land and New Holland, which had recently been discovered by Bass ; then to proceed to the discovery and survey of the unknown parts of the coast of New Holland, under the general guidance of the Governor of New South Wales. His voyage was long and eventful. \" His Majesty's Tinderbox,\" as the Lady Nelson was popularly nicknamed, was nearly eight months in reaching Australia ; the provisions were running short, and all were tired of being cooped up in so cramped a space, rolling and heaving on these heavy seas, when on the 2nd December, 1800, there came drifting on the north wind an unfortunate horse-stinger, driven far from land, to hurl his shining wings against their swelling sails. All hearts were glad at the sight, for it meant the near approach of land, and accordingly when the daybreak lifted heavily next morning the mariners saw looming up in the distance some cone shaped hills, that were the first glimpse to them of Australian soil ; and after a few hours' sailing they sighted a bold promontory on a part of the Australian coast that had never yet been explored. This point was named by Grant Cape Northumberland, after the duke of that name who was then commander-in-chief of the British army and a benefactor of Grant's family. The two hills were named Gambier's Mount and Schanck's Mount, the former slightly altered being now the name of a well-known district of South Australia.2 Eastward the little Lady Nelson plunged past a long stretch of sandy shore, backed by lands of flat and scrubby aspect, or by the undulating lines of sand-hills. The shores trended southward, and became higher till they ended in the bold and weatherworn cliffs of a hill-shaped promontory, which Grant called Cape Bridgewater, after a member of the British Cabinet. All that evening he strove to weather the cape, but the wind was light, and in spite of his sliding keels he had to hold off for the night, keeping a careful watch on these lonely and wholly unknown seas whereon unthought of dangers might possibly lie. In the morning he succeeded, by keeping some six or seven miles off the cape, in rounding it safely, and then saw a second bold headland some fifteen miles beyond, to which he affixed the popular name of Nelson, then in the zenith of his fame, and after whose wife the little vessel was called. Between these two points the rocks retreated to form a pleasant bay, whose shores rose high and green, and crowned with woods that seemed refreshing to the somewhat weary voyagers. Grant would willingly have taken his vessel to anchor in the bay, but with the wind blowing as then it did, there was some chance of his not getting out again very readily. He, however, rowed in with his launch and sounded, but found the water too deep for anchorage. A few fires sent up their lazy blue columns here and there among the grassy hills, but the swell was too heavy to permit of a landing on these limestone rocks and cave-hollowed promontories. When he joined his vessel again the wind was freshening, but still so light that it required the launch to tow ahead in order to clear Cape Nelson. As evening descended the Lady Nelson was slowly moving before a south-west wind, along the shores of a deep '-' Grant, p. 68."], [53, "THE EXPLORATLON OF THE COASTS OF VICTORIA. 33 bay, and from league to league among the wood-clad hills, they still saw the thin blue columns of many native fires ; while under the leisurely dipping bowsprit, the porpoises tumbled, and an occasional seal looked up with wonder and made for the shore. So the evening closed in and they lost sight of the coast ; but at five next morning they came in sight of another point, to which the name Cape Solicitor was attached on their rough map, and off it lay two rocks which Grant called the \" Lawrence Rocks.\" Lady Julia Percy Island was then seen; but the name as given by Grant was Lady Julian's Island. From this point the land was seen to bend to the north in a broad bay, into which, as the wind was unsuitable, he did not venture, but held due east all night across the mouth of the bay, to which he gave the name of his patron the Duke of Portland. At daybreak, when they had run seventy miles, they were in sight of a hazy mass of high land ahead of them, and getting nearer, saw for the first time that long line of high and forbidding cliffs which has since then heard the crash of many a ship in full career, and the night-borne shriek of many death-doomed beings. But the Lady Nelson easily weathered the high forbidding promontory, and her crew looked out with wonder on those picturesque shores, rising into high ranges, thickly covered with gigantic timber, dipping into deep gullies beneath the gloomy groves of gum trees. To this point Grant gave the name of Cape Albany Otway, but it is now known as Cape Otway. Some ten miles further on, a rocky headland rose with a clump of fine trees upon its crest, and this was named Cape Patton.3 On they sailed beneath those shores of Apollo and Loutitt Bays, now so favoured of holiday-makers, watching the hills rise and the valleys unfold ; observing the height of the timber and the rush of the mountain streams. Grant would have been glad of some fresh water, and resolved to make an effort to land ; but as he approached the long sandy beach he found no shelter place, but only a line of tumbling surf to east and to west as far as the eye could see. He approached within a cable's length of the beach, but turned back \" much disappointed to be so near without setting foot on this beautiful spot;'\" and visitors to the district of Lome will understand his disappointment. At the high woody point which he called Cape Patton, Grant ceased to follow the coast, and as night came on made all snug on board for a smart run to the east ; but by doing so he missed his only chance of finding Port Phillip, for when he altered his course at daylight to the north and again reached land at a lofty and remarkable promontory, he was ten or twelve miles past the opening of that inlet. This lofty headland, three hundred feet clear from the surf that breaks round its curiously-shaped rocks, he named Cape Schanck, after his friend the Captain. He could see that the coast bent northward in a long sweep, and this hollow he called \"Governor King's Bay,\" but he was too far off to have any hint of the fine harbour that lay within it. On he went, beside the long basaltic cliffs, naming one that projected some distance Cape Liptrap and after a time came in view of the great mound-shaped mass of Wilson's Promontory There he discovered a row of small rocky islets which he called the Glenny Isles, after a friend in London. He tried unsuccessfully to land on one of them, then pulled in his boat among the group, examining them and giving them names. They were of rocky edge, but covered with bushes to the top, and they swarmed with sea fowl.5 As soon as he had reached Wilson's Promontory his independent discoveries were clearly over, for all to the east had already been visited by Bass, and indeed he had with him a 3 Grant, p. 72. \u25a0 Grant, p. 74. 5 Grant, p. 75. F Vol. I."], [54, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 34 copy of Bass's chart which Sir Joseph Banks had given him before he left England. The Lady Nelson arrived in Port Jackson on the 16th of December, 1800, and her crew seem to have been glad to find their voyage safely terminated after being cooped up nine months and a half on so small a vessel. It is clear from Grant's own narrative that he was by no means a genius in the way of discovery, but rather a capable seaman of a respectable but ordinary class. It is not at all improbable that had he possessed a small portion of the zeal, the devotion, the fearlessness of Flinders, he might on that trip have made known, in all its completeness, the whole length of the Victorian coast. Instead of that, he had left a gap at Portland Bay and a great gap from Cape Patton to Cape Schanck, and so entirely missed what has proved to be the most important inlet of all. When he reached Sydney he met with a friendly reception from Governor King, who seems to have been fairly well content with the work that had been done. But a fortnight later, on the last day of the year, the commission of the Lady Nelson expired. The crew were paid off and each received a gratuity in accordance with the orders of the Admiralty. Grant had brought his own recompense with him in the form of a promotion to be lieutenant on board His Majesty's ship Supply, which was stationed at Sydney. But he had the mortification to find on reaching Port Jackson, that that vessel had been condemned as too old for service and had been laid by as a hulk. He would therefore have been thrown out of service if Governor King had not arranged to keep him in command of the. Lady Nelson for some time longer. For there had recently been some inquiry from the British Government as to the possibility of finding two or three suitable positions on the Australian coasts in which to found new settlements. It was felt that the existence of a single small settlement at Port Jackson could not be a valid claim to the permanent possession of a whole continent, and in view of the restless activity of the French Republic, which was then fast gaining an ascendant position in European politics, it seemed wise to extend the British settlements in those seas. It is very probable also that the English Government thought it undesirable to gather too great a mass of convicts at one point, and therefore contemplated the formation of several new penal settlements. But, at any rate, it is clear that King had received instructions to look about and report on some favourable spot for a new colony. Western Port, as described by Bass, was the most inviting harbour on the mainland, and King resolved to make a careful examination of that inlet the first work of his newly-acquired exploring vessel the Lady Nelson. Lieutenant Grant, contrary to his original intention, took command of her, and Lieutenant Murray took second place ; as it was proposed to land and examine the country, a force of four marines under Ensign Barallicr was sent with the vessel ; but of her formcr crew only two would reship in her. Grant had been strict in his discipline ; the vessel had been small and was reckoned dangerous, while the pay offered on board the merchant vessels in the harbour was better than that of His Majesty ; so Grant, much to his disgust, had to be content with a crew of convicts who knew nothing of seamanship, and who lay down sea sick as soon as the vessel was out on the rolling Pacific.'' Mr. Cayley, the botanist, accompanied the expedition, and a Sydney native with his wife was added, in the hopes that he might find himself intelligible to the natives round Western Port. Grant took twelve days to reach Wilson's Promontory, and on the following evening, \" Grant, p. 85."], [55, "TLIE EXPLORATION OF THE COASTS OF VICTORIA. 35 2 ist March, 1801, he passed into Western Port through a narrow passage, its rock)- sides densely lined with seals and great sea-elephants, whose incessant grunting re-echoed up the lonely bay. As the object of the expedition was to determine how far Western Port was suitable for a settlement, the first thing to be done after anchoring was to find a river, or at least a fresh-water stream. Grant and Barallier and the second mate, Bowen, each made an ineffectual effort to discover a stream of even the smallest size. Subsequently Barallier and Murray occupied themselves in surveying and making a careful chart of the port, while Caylcy went in search of plants, and took some pains to determine the value of the surrounding soil. The land was thinly wooded, with timber of no great size, but often densely covered with a tangled brushwood; though in many places there were great circles and open spaces of rich, grassy land, quite like carefully-kept meadows whereon cattle would easily fatten. After a few days of toilsome search, Bowen at last found a small stream ; and on the 27th March Murray, Barallier and Caylcy explored it. The)- found it narrow and endless in its windings, but they traced it in their boat till stopped where a mass of fallen trees dipped their trunks and branches in the still, dark waters. On the last day of March, Grant arranged for a more extensive examination of this stream. He ascended as before, and then walked along the river bank, through a land of no little beaut)-. The trees grew larger as they procccdcd, but the soil more free from scrub, and in those long forest glades under which they marched they looked through pleasant vistas of luxuriantly waving grass, with sometimes a peep at the deep blue mountains away to the cast. As they ascended the stream the country became wilder, and the valley more enclosed. There they found sassafras trees and gums of stately aspect ; and deep in the hidden woods there sounded the silver tinkling of the Bell Bird ; while the loud Ha! ha! of the Laughing Jackass startled the ears of those but new to the colonies. During their stay in Western Port, which lasted over a month, the voyagers made a practical test of its fitness for agriculture. On a small island where the soil seemed free and tolerably rich, Grant found a situation which charmed him exceedingly. It was an open forest with a low growth of rather thick underwood, but it was pleasantly sheltered, and had a noble prospect of the harbour and some of its channels. Here he marked off a space for a garden some three or four acres in extent, and landed a party to clear and dig it. They felled a few of the larger trees, and burnt off the underwood ; with the trunks of the fallen trees they built a blockhouse of somewhat commodious size, the first white man's structure on Victorian soil. There was neither plough nor spade on board the Lady Nelson, nor even a hoe. The coal-shovel had to be impressed into the service of the first agricultural efforts made in Victoria, and after three or four days of work in the light and. open soil a moderate extent of land was ready to receive seed. It so happened that Grant, before he left England, had been supplied by a Devonshire gentleman named Churchill with quite a variety of seeds, including wheat, maize, peas, rice, and coffee berries. Grant in gratitude called his island Churchill Island, and proceeded to sow the seeds; potatoes also were planted, and round his blockhouse Grant placed the seeds of climbing plants, and dotted here and there those of a few fruit trees, delighting himself with the prospect of what this silent retreat would be on its rising ground, when the fields were in grain and the garden in bloom, and the dwelling wreathed with flowers. But he was not destined to see it himself, nor to eat of the fruit of those peach, and nectarine, and apple trees whose seeds had been bestowed on him in England."], [56, "36 VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. Near the end of April Grant worked his little vessel out of Western Port, and turned his course towards Sydney. He commenced to make a careful survey of the coast towards Wilson's Promontory; but, when only twenty miles were finished, he grew impatient at the baffling weather, and ran as smartly as he could for Port Jackson. Here ended the labours of Lieutenant Grant upon the shores of Victoria. His name will always be remembered in our history, with which it is inseparably connected ; but his position was by no means a great one. He did his month's work ever)- month for his month's pay, and showed no particular zeal, nor any notable enterprise in pursuing the duty he undertook. He had splendid opportunities of doing original work \u2014 such as would have fired a Cook or a Flinders to famous researches \u2014 but he let them slip. He thought that his chances of promotion were small if he stayed in the colonies. A better-paid position, with less trouble attached to it, was more suited to his inclination ; and so, after a month or two of exploring near the mouth of the Hunter River, he resigned his command, and took his passage for London, where he immediately made a claim for \u00a390 as recompense for his extra labours and some small losses he had incurred. He received his money, published his story of his voyage and his account of the behaviour of vessels with sliding-keels, and so disappears from history. Governor King reported of him that he was a \" sober, steady, capable officer,\" but without any knowledge of \" surveying and delineation.\" Let us be glad that he received the promotion he so ardently longed for. The Lady Nelson now passed under the command of Murray, who had been a lieutenant on board H.M.S- Porpoise, and the first use made of her was to carry on the survey of Bass's Straits. Governor King had reported to the Duke of Portland that Western Port was a place eminently suitable for the formation of a settlement, but he did not know whether there might not be a better, and he wished to have some important points cleared up about Western Port itself before taking on himself the responsibility of advising the sending of a convict fleet thither. Accordingly, on the 12th November, 1801, the little vessel left Sydney on her third voyage of discovery,7 and on the 6th of December reached the entrance to Western Port, which was entered the following morning. The vessel cast anchor at the mouth of the streamlet now known as Bass's River. On ascending it, the rich verdure of the banks, and the picturesque reaches of the stream, made even more impression than on the first visit. Next day Murray went ashore to look at the garden on Churchill Island. The wheat was waving 6 feet high, with stalks like young sugar-canes ; the onions and other plants were flourishing, but the potatoes had been rooted up by wild animals. Murray, though surprised by the luxuriance of the growth, was not inclined to take so sanguine a view of the place as Grant did. He considered that in the main the soil was too poor and sandy to repay a settler for the toil of actual cultivation.8 After a second careful examination of the port, Murray prepared to execute the remainder of his commission in regard to a survey of Bass's Straits. The winds being rarely favourable for sailing out of the long and narrow channel that formed the entrance to the port, he was forced to ' The authority for this voyage is the log-book kept by Lieutenant Murray, and now in the possession of the Admiralty at London. It was discovered there a few years since by Mr. F. P. Labilliere, who caused a copy of it to be made for our Public Library. That M.S. copy is in the possession of the librarian, but as it is not likely to be much referred to by the public, the references here given are to Mr. Labilliere's \" Early History of Victoria,\" Vol. I., wherein he has, with singular zeal for our early records, published most of these original documents almost in extenso. The log-book of Murray is there reproduced in all its important features, nothing being omitted that is of any evident bearing on our history. s Labilliere, p. 65."], [57, "THE EXPLORATION OF THE COASTS OF VICTORIA. 37 remain inactive for some time, the two efforts he made to leave the place being thwarted by the dying away of the breezes on which he relied. On a third attempt he had all but reached the open sea when a wild gale began to blow. The Lady Nelson was scarcely in shelter again when a furious hurricane, with thunder and lightning, raged overhead, and, even in that secure harbour, caused a severe strain on the three anchors by which she was held. Murray rightly judged that had the vessel been an hour earlier \u2014 had she just managed to creep round the corner when that hurricane blew dead against the formidable coast \u2014 nothing would have saved her from being dashed to pieces against those league-long cliffs. So the Christmas of 1S01 was spent in waiting, and for a fortnight after, the seamen had little to do but lie about, or vary the monotony by trips on shore, to catch wild swans and shoot the pigeons and crested birds of the woods. A pretty little well of water was found not far from the anchorage \u2014 a moist spot covered with watercresses and blackberries \u2014 a little digging brought plenty of water, which after a few hours was deliciously bright and fresh and cool. New Year's Day was dark, with a black squall of wind and rain, but the)- made themselves as merry as they could, and welcomed the season with three ringing cheers. Four days later they made their first acquaintance with the natives of the district. Their fires had long been visible, but too far inland for intercourse, till on the 4th January Mr. Bowen, who was on shore shooting ducks, saw a fire on the beach near the mouth of Bass's River. He returned to his boat, and rowing along to meet the natives whom he expected to find there, saw them sitting in a semicircle, each warrior grasping his bundle of spears. The seamen called out to them, and they returned the greeting with no signs of alarm. Between the boat and the beach there lay a shallow sandbank of some 200 yards across; and at that distance conversation was not convenient. Bowen got out of the boat alone, and waded through the shallow water to their position. The)' jumped on their feet, when he perceived that they were all clad down to the waist in opossum skins, and their leader was an elderly man with a long bushy beard, and a face set off by a pattern in red ochre. As he approached they threw off their skin coverings, and indicated to him that he also must uncover, which he readily did. When he was very near them they became uneasy, and began to finger nervously their bundles of barbed spears. Bowen threw them a tomahawk, and by signs begged them to sit down, as he himself did. They all, except the old chief, complied, but the)- threw him back his tomahawk. He then offered them a handkerchief, which they accepted, but when Bowen, in bluff British sailor fashion, wished to shake hands all round, that was a custom and a familiarity they could not understand. He ate some bread and offered them a share; they took it, and laid it down beside them ; some ducks which he gave them, they examined with much curiosity to determine how they had been killed ; but shortly after they expressed a wish that he would go back into his boat and show them how he travelled on the water, pointing to a sandy point a little distance off. So he caused his crew to pull gently along by the shore, whilst his dusky acquaintances walked upon the beach in company. When they had thus proceeded about a mile and a-half, they stopped and made signs for the boat to pull in. This was done, and Bowen had reason to imagine that their camp must be near at hand in the woods, for now, for the first time, three women made their appearance, each with a child on her back. Bowen again went ashore, and asked permission to warm his hands at a fine fire he saw burning a little way off the beach. As far as he could judge by their signs, they refused, and the women and boys seemed to be laughing at him."], [58, "38 VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. Hereupon the crew, imitating the conciliatory tactics of their commander, stripped themselves stark naked, and getting out of the boat, pushed their way through the water to approach the blacks more closely. The old chief, in a passion, ordered the boys and women to retire, while he got his spears ready poised for action, and seemed on the point of throwing. Bowen ordered one of his men to fire a musket over their heads; an instant of blank amazement, a rush, and in the twinkling of an eye, not a figure was to be seen but the parade of naked white men. Bowen took his boat back to the ship, and no more was seen of the natives; they kept well in cover of the bush, but after sunset appeared to have sallied out to extinguish their fire. So terminated the first interview between white and black in Victoria. It was not unkindly in its intention on the part of Mr. Bowen, and, in his rough sailor way, he did his best to be friendly; but it is not difficult to observe in his own account of it, that he had too little notion of managing such matters, and wholly failed in doing what Flinders and Sturt succeeded in doing with no great difficult)-. Next day, 5th June, 1802, the Lady Nelson was able to run out of Western Port, and stood for Cape Schanck, which was passed a little after noon. The cliffy shores here ended, and then the low sandhills were fringed by a long flat beach that continued for twelve or fifteen miles, and behind the sandhills there stretched a long line of wooded hills. But this was indistinctly visible, for a thin blue haze lay over all, lit up by the blaze of sunlight in the returning fine weather ; and there, in that sandy line, a glimmering break could be seen, and a faint gleam beyond seemed to indicate that it was only the opening to a wider inlet within. The wind was blowing straight for the opening, it would be easy to reach it, but possibly not so easy to get back again if it proved impassable. Down came the little craft, with spreading sails, with Bowen the mate and Barnes the boatswain's mate at the mast-head on the look-out for danger, and the man at the bows ready to heave the lead. When about a mile and a-half from that entrance to the unknown inlet, the cry from the mast-head was that broken water was in front, and at the same time the man at the bows called out a sudden shoaling to ten fathoms. That strong ripple, popularly known as the \" Rip,\" which is due to the outflowing tide and the in-rolling waves, and which makes the entrance to Port Phillip always a trifle awkward, seems to have alarmed Murray. He could see a sandy islet just inside the entrance, and he thought the broken water indicated a reef or shallows and bar across it. Murray thought he was quite near enough to an unknown coast, and sheered off to the west ; as he passed in front of the opening he caught a transient glimpse of the shining expanse within ; and so was the first to look upon the waters of our great harbour. He had, however, to postpone for the present the examination of his important discovery, and by pressing on all sail managed to clear the shore and stand south-west towards Cape Otway, keeping twenty miles off the formidable shores of the Loutitt Bay district. In the evening the land was only a dim haze to the north, and he took short tacks all night long. All next day he headed for Cape Otway, which he ncared in the evening, but did not see till the haze cleared away on the following morning. Murray tried to survey the coast west of the Cape, but once he was beyond its shelter the heavy rolling seas from the open ocean and frequent squalls of wind and rain frustrated his purpose, and he turned his ship for King's Island, which he wished to explore. He occupied a fortnight in sailing round that island and making the first careful chart of its shores; then on January 27th he"], [59, "THE EXPLORATLON OF THE COASTS OF VICTORIA. 39 stood northward for Cape Otway again,\" in the hopes of now being able to examine the coast in detail ; but still there raged the same unpleasant weather. He remarks in his log that he \" never experienced such a length of bad weather at any time of the year or in any country since he sailed the seas,\" and at the close of the month he again took shelter in Western Port. No sooner was he safely anchored there, than he sent Bowen in the launch with five armed men and fourteen days' provisions to sound and examine the important entrance they had seen a few weeks before ; Bowen was to return with a report as to whether the entrance would be safe for the Lady Nelson. He left at daybreak on the first of February, stood round Cape Schanck, without difficulty, for though there was a heavy swell that splashed violently among the rocks and roared in long rollers on the sandy beaches, yet there was little wind and the launch rapidly shot through the entrance into calm water under the lee of the sandhills of Point Nepean. Here he stayed two days, and sounded the channel ; finding a good passage, nowhere less than six fathoms in depth. To Mr. Bowen is due the credit of being the first European that ever floated over the broad surface of Port Phillip, and the date of his entrance, ist February, 1802, ought to be boldly marked on our Victorian calendars as one of no little importance.\"' During their two days' stay in the harbour, Bowen and his men lived to a considerable extent on swans which they found in great numbers over on the side that is now called Queenscliff ; on the 4th he safely navigated his little bark back upon the open seas, and late at night joined the Lady Nelson at her anchorage in Western Port. Murray was now most anxious to proceed to the survey of his new discovery, but again there were ten days of weary waiting, while the winds blew overhead from every quarter but the one that would have suited him for working out of Western Port. But the longest lane, as they say, has its turning. On Sunday the 15th the wind sprang up fresh from the south-east; anchors were at once heaved, sails set, and the Lady Nelson was merrily spinning out on the open, round Cape Schanck and through the Heads, without mishap, and at three in the afternoon was riding at anchor a quarter of a mile from a sandy shore, between the sites of the present villages of Rye and Sorrento, the pioneer of all those great fleets that now daily plough the waters of Port Phillip. The afternoon was spent in a pleasant walk of a couple of miles through the woodlands, on a fine firm sward underfoot, with handsome honeysuckle trees overhead; a few parrots were the only living things, but they saw- the abandoned huts of a native encampment. The great size of the harbour, the agreeable appearance of its shores, and the evident convenience it would offer to navigation, delighted the heart of Murray, who gave to the inlet the name of Port King, in honour of the governor at Sydney ; but King, who was always a modest man, subsequently altered the name to Port Phillip, which now it bears, in honour of the high-souled sailor who first bore sway in Australia. A hill to the north-cast, which seemed to be the termination of a moderately-elevated range, attracted his attention, and its appearance from that aspect presenting somewhat the outline of Arthur's Seat as seen from Edinburgh, Murray gave to it that name, dear to his younger days. On the following day he set out for a longer walk, taking with him a soldier and the carpenter of the vessel, who was to examine the value of the timber they were likely to see. In his log he tells us that he ascended to the top of a high hill, but he does not name it. To the top of Arthur's Seat is rather a long walk from the place where he was 9 Labilliere, p. 85. \" Labilliere, p. 86. G Vol. I."], [60, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 40 anchored, but there is no other hill of any eminence nearer, and we may therefore reasonably enough conjecture that it was along the level woodlands, behind the site of the present fishing village of the Rosebud, that he trudged that sultry afternoon. He doubtless climbed one of the southern spurs of Arthur's Seat, and there enjoyed the charming summer view. He tells us that the hills and valleys seemed to rise and fall with inexpressible elegance ; a great stretch of level lands all wooded lay to the south, till bounded by a line of dazzling sand hills ; and away beyond these the Southern Ocean in dreamy tints rose to the horizon, and melted there into the sky. There lay Cape Schanck to the left, and on the right the narrow entrance to the port, far away and faint with distance. Behind him he could just see the gleam of the Western Port ; but it was when looking over Port Phillip itself that he experienced the fullest satisfaction. There headland opened out after headland, and the slumbering waters lapped long lines of curving beach that swept away, first north, then eastwards and more eastwards, till lost in hazy forests of mist-like timber, where now spread the clustered mansions of Brighton. Delighted with the extent of the discovery he had made, he returned to his vessel, and next day brought her up nearer to the hill, where she anchored not far from the present site of Rye. In the afternoon he sent Bowen with the launch to find the natives, if possible, and open up communications with them. The boat had not proceeded more than half way to the shore when he had the satisfaction of seeing some eighteen or twenty black men issue on the beach and seat themselves on one of the grassy knolls that lie just behind the sand. Bowen and his men accordingly landed and proceeded straight towards them ; a friendly talk by means of signs ensued ; Bowen gave them a few trifles, and induced them to dance for him, when, in return, the British Jack tars showed them what a sailor's hornpipe was like ; the grass)- mound being thus the scene of quite a little pantomime. To finish this little entertainment, Bowen dressed out his forest friends in some cast-off shirts, and invited them on board. The)- naturally were a little shy, and declined, but gave hy, and declined, but gave him a neat straw basket. Bowen then returned to the Lady Nelson, but was sent back with a present of some bread, looking-glasses, a tomahawk and a picture, to induce them to give in- formation as to the nearest stream of fresh water. Bowen was again received in a friendly manner, and, sitting down in the midst of them, proceeded to eat his dinner in order to encourage them, for. Both he and the crew giving them a little os whatever they asked gave them nearly all the clothes they were wearing, and two lads in particular were rigged out in a complete nautical outfit. All this was well meant, but it is not to be supposed that the British tar beheld these sable counterfeits of themselves without many a loud burst of"], [61, "THE EXPLORATION OF THE COASTS OF VICTORIA. 41 noisy laughter; and as the blackfellows arc very sensitive, and, like dogs and children, cannot bear to be laughed at, we may imagine that whilst our jolly sailors were at their merriest, and in their most friendly mood, the blacks were darkly working up for a storm. When the sailors had finished their dinner, one of the youngest got up to go back to the boat, and caught a glimpse of a native behind a tree poising a spear. He called out to Bowen, who was in the act of dispensing his bread to the blacks around him, but, before it was possible to rise, a spear went whizzing through the crowd close by the bod)- of one of the crew. At once, and as if on a preconcerted signal, the natives fell back to right and to left, exposing to view a number of armed men prepared for conflict, who were issuing from behind the bushes. Spears came whistling from all sides, but Bowen contented himself with firing a single musket over their heads. They stopped for a moment in surprise, but, immediately gathering their self-possession, again urged forward a flight of evil-looking weapons. A volley was then poured among them, at which they began to run, when two of the sailors shot one of them through the back as he exposed it in his flight. Some turned at a little distance off to throw a few more spears, but a second volley, in which another was shot, sent them flying in panic into the recesses of the woods. One of them, probably wounded, was caught by Bowen and held by three sailors, but he wriggled out of their grasp and escaped, although, as he ran, two bullets were sent through his body by well-aimed musket-shots. Murray, from the deck of his vessel, not five hundred yards away, could see the whole affray, and watched their naked forms scampering through the open bush close by the beach. They were impeded by their efforts to throw off the garments in which the sailors had decked them. One in especial was seen struggling with a white shirt, which he vainly strove to throw off, and his appearance, as he dodged behind the dark stems of the honeysuckle trees, seemed to Murray extremely comical. To increase this panic, he fired a broadside of round-shot and grape into the forest where they were running, but, so far as he could see, did no execution with it. Meantime, the sailors were picking up spears, and skin-cloaks, and native baskets, till Murray signalled to them, and they rowed back to the ship. Thus ended the first affray between whites and blacks in Victoria. The sailors had no intention to fight ; their feelings had been patronisingly amicable. The aggressors were undoubtedly the natives, and to them be the blame. At the same time it is to be noticed that the British sailor was not likely to have fineness of feeling enough to sympathise with the views they were likely to entertain of such an interview, and when the attack was commenced they were, with the tone of mind natural to their class, much too ready to exhibit their power and display their skill as marksmen. In short, they displayed the commoner aspect of ordinary human nature, whereas their delicate position as pioneers of a superior race among suspicious barbarians would have required a much higher soul and a more elevated view of duty. The beach a mile or two beyond Dromana Lighthouse seems to have been the scene that drank in the first blood of the native tribes spilt in the war of races in Victoria. The next week was spent in short trips by land, and small boat excursions. The most important of these was that in which the launch examined the shores of the Queenscliff district, and found a shallow lagoon, which they called Swan Harbour, by reason of the immense numbers of black swans that breasted its glassy waters and tended their fledging young ones in its quiet recesses. The seamen caught no less than twenty without firing a single shot, so numerous and so tame were the)'."], [62, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT 42 Another fortnight passed in what we must regard as a very leisurely survey of the entrance to the port Nothing was done in the way of ascending the inlet to its head, and there is no evidence that in an)- of their trips the)- even got as much as ten miles north of the entrance. But certainly the visits of future vessels would be much facilitated by the extensive sets of soundings taken to discover the safest passage through the channel. On Tuesday, 9th March, the ceremony of taking possession of the port was duly performed. A flagstaff on a sandy point of the Sorrento shore was erected to carry the Union Jack, while the masts of the Lady Nelson also displayed the British colours. Then, expending most of the small quan tity of powder they had left in a grand salvo of artillery, with three vol leys of musketry, they declared all these lands the property of His Sacred Majesty King George the Third of Great Britain and Ireland. Two or three days were spent \"about and under the colours,\" and in \"overhauling the beach and woods,\" or in other words enjoying little picnics on shore, and then on 1 2th March, at daybreak, they rounded Point Nepean, were shaken up a good deal on the \"Rip,\" and so out on the open sea. They had been victualled for twenty-four weeks, and of these twenty were now gone. Hence the crew were doubtless in a hurry to see Port Jackson again, and greeted with pleasure the distant roofs of Sydney on the 24th of March, 1802. Mr. Labilliere has, with zealous industry, traced the future career of the Lady Nelson. She was employed in colonial surveys for over twenty years, and in 1825 was sent to assist in the formation of a new settlement in the north of Australia. She crossed to the East India Islands for a cargo of fresh meat, and on the shores of one of the Timorlaut group was surprised by Malays \u2014 part of the crew were destroyed, another part detained in slavery, but never rescued.\" What afterwards became of Murray and Bowen is not known ; but there is reason to believe that they made no great success in their profession. It is a singular thing that just six weeks after Murray left Port Phillip Heads, Flinders sailed through the same opening, and floated on the broad inlet with all the pride of a new and important discovery. In his ship the Investigator he had traced all the southern shores from Cape Leeuwin, making a marine survey of them superior to anything that had hitherto been done on any unknown coast. He had been the first explorer of all the coast of the present colony of South Australia, with the exception of a small piece at the extreme cast; for there he met with Captain Baudin, the commander of a French expedition of two vessels Labilliere I., p. ic"], [63, "THE EXPLORATION OF THE COASTS OF VICTORIA. 43 which had for some time been on these shores; but Baudin had, unfortunately for himself, spent so much of his time resurveying the coasts of Tasmania, which Flinders had already amply surveyed, that when he came to do some work on the unknown southern shores of Australia, he found he had been anticipated. Nearly a year and a-half ago Grant had examined all the shores of Victoria that Bass had left unvisited. Murray had already been in Port Phillip, the entrance to which Baudin missed as he passed along. It was not till he passed Cape Northumberland, as he moved westward, that he began to be on an undiscovered coast, and he had scarcely gone 150 miles ere he met with Flinders, who was coming in the opposite direction, and had done all that could be done in the way of discovery on the remainder of the southern coast. They reached each other in a long indentation, which Flinders, from that circumstance, called Encounter Bay, and after an exchange of civilities, each pursued his own course. Flinders knew that after passing Cape Northumberland he was on a coast already moderately known, for he had with him a rough copy of Lieutenant Grant's sketch map, which had been sent to England by Governor King; but he spent some time in surveying and charting it in his usual careful manner, and it was not till the 26th April, 1802, that he caught a glimpse of the narrow channel midway between Capes Otway and Schanck. On sailing towards it he could see beyond the heads a spacious harbour, and resolved to run for it. He did not hesitate, but about half-past one in the day gave the order to head the vessel for the opening. Every man was at his post ready to send the vessel about at the slightest hint of danger, while the lead was kept carefully going. On through the broken water dashed the Investigator in solemn silence, except for the splash of the waves and the monotonous chant of the man heaving the lead. So she moved till four miles within the entrance, and then the water shoaled rapidly. Flinders at once tacked to the cast, but without any warning the vessel drove upon a mud bank and stuck fast. It was not till late in the afternoon that she was worked off, and then she came to an anchor two miles off the sandy shore, whereon now stands the watering-place of Sorrento.'2 The bluff hill, which Murray had called Arthur's Seat, attracted the attention of Flinders, and as it was close to the water's edge, and over a thousand feet high, he resolved to ascend it in order to determine the shape and extent of the inlet he supposed himself to have discovered. Taking with him Mr. Brown, the naturalist of the expedition, he sailed in a boat, and after a pleasant run of nine miles landed on the beach of Dromana Bay. An easy stroll up the grassy slopes of the hill among shady groves of wattle trees, brought them to the crest of a hill well wooded and carpeted with delicately-tinted wild flowers. The view over the shimmering waters was fascinatingly beautiful, and he was charmed with the great extent of the inlet and the pleasant look of its shores. Western Port was seen, and that westerly branch of the harbour which is now called Corio Bay. A bluff headland at the entrance to that bay he called Indented Head, from the peculiar look of the three little hills upon it. Whilst Flinders was busy taking a series of observations for his survey, the rest of the party walked in various directions. They found many marks of native encampments, but saw nothing of the people themselves ; and in the evening returned to the vessel after a delightful day's trip. Next morning Flinders wished to carry his ship up the port and to examine all its shores ; but after a day of slow progress, he found the winds too light to allow of rapid work being done. He therefore left the ship with Mr. Fowler, giving him instructions to take \u25a0- Flinders' Voyage I., p. 211."], [64, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 44 her back to the entrance so as to be ready to leave the port at an hour's notice, and himself taking a boat with provisions for three days set out on a flying survey trip. Round the rocks of Mount Martha, he held his way, tacking now this way and now that along the silent shore. But as he neared the rocky headland now called Schnapper Point, the wind was unfavourable for weathering it, and there he landed and lunched among those tea-tree groves that have now-a-days mostly made way for the prosperous streets of Mornington. The wind being more suitable for ascending the harbour on the other side, he steered in the afternoon straight across the middle for Indented Head on the opposite shore, and there, at nine in the evening, he landed and set up his tent for the night. In the morning a number of natives were seen about a mile away, but being shy they decamped. Flinders left some strips of bright red cloth hanging near their encampment as a present, and started in his boat to examine Corio Bay. At noon, when at the entrance of the bay, he landed on the north side of Indented Head, and when three natives made their appearance, succeeded in gaining their confidence. They took a few presents, gave a few in exchange, shared with the white men the dinner that they partook of on the shores of the present Portarlington, and left them on friendly terms. Flinders regarded the hills of the You Yangs as being favourable for the purposes of surveying ; he judged them to be over a thousand feet in height, and not above sixteen or eighteen miles away. In the afternoon he crossed Corio Bay, sounding carefully all the way, and pitched his tent on the shore as near to the foot of the hill as he could, finding some difficult)- in those clayey marshes to discover a dry place for camping on, and still more trouble in securing dry wood wherewith to cook the savoury ducks and teal he had shot on the bay. Next morning at dawn, leaving a guard at the tent, he started with three of his crew to ascend the hills. At first the road was monotonous, being a plain of bare clay, but afterwards, a mile or two from the hill, they entered a wood and found some excitement in giving chase to a kangaroo and an emu which were too far off to be shot. A rough scramble of an hour or so took them to the top at about ten in the morning, and there they spent three or four hours on the breezy summit with a fair prospect stretching far away beneath their feet. Flinders took numerous observations and made rough sketches, so that, as he could not afford many days in the harbour, he thought he could plot in the outline of the inlet without further examination. Many hills and mountains were seen inland, but beneath them there were only the level expanses of water and almost equally level plains of slightly timbered, but mostly grassy country. In the afternoon, Flinders wrote the name of the vessel on a scroll of paper, and buried it beneath a cairn on the summit of the hill. It was between three and four o'clock when they again reached their boat, and pushed off for Indented Head, where they landed soon after dark. During the night fires were seen flitting to and fro along the shores, and a careful watch was kept round their tent; but there was no molestation from the natives. In the morning, Flinders sailed along the shore back towards the Heads; he turned into the shallow sheet of water which Murray had called Swan Harbour, and there caught three swans out of the stately flocks that dotted its surface. The Investigator was now lying three miles from the entrance to the port, ready to get away next morning, and in the evening Flinders reached her, fatigued, but well pleased with his three days' work. In his journal he remarks that it is very difficult to speak in general terms of Port Phillip. It is a fine harbour, but with a difficult entrance. It has no good timber, but the country has a generally fertile appearance : in particular he picks out Indented"], [65, "THE EXPLORATION OF THE COASTS OF VICTORIA 45 Head as being of favourable soil, an opinion that the great success of onion growing has in late years amply justified. On May 3rd the Investigator was carefully piloted through the channel, and when she was five miles outside, Mr. Westall the well-known landscape painter, who was on board, took a sketch of the opening as a means of identification when future visitors should approach it. Then they stood away for Cape Schanck. Flinders was in Port Phillip only six days, for that was all the time he could spare ; yet he had done much more in that time than Murray had in twenty-six ; for Flinders was made of the stuff that constitutes the great workers of the world ; his labours were nervous with life, and ardour, and devotion. It is therefore scarcely to be wondered at, that in speaking of the discovery of Port Phillip, Flinders' name is always mentioned on at least equal terms .with that of Murray, whose career both before and after his services in these waters was only that of a very common-place person."], [66, "46 lieut.-governor david collins and the bITE 0F THK FIRST SETTLEMENT CHAPTER IV. X\u00bbe 3First Httempteb Settlement HILE Captain Baudin was lying in Sydney Harbour at the end of 1S02, refitting his vessels and renovating his prostrate crew, the time passed pleasantly in the interchange of civilities between French and English. The two nations were at war in Europe, but hostilities were languishing, and matters were tending slowly to the Peace of Amiens, and a temporary period of quietness. But in Port Jackson, as Governor King remarked, the English would have no thought of enmity against an expedition planned for the sole purpose of advancing the cause of science. So, with only one little hitch of no consequence, French and English at Sydney were on the most' friendly terms, and the two commanders learnt greatly to value each other. But the Governor was at the same time a little uneasy as to the ulterior aims of the French, and viewed with no little alarm the prospect of a colony of a belligerent nation being founded on the Australian coast, not only as a permanent threat to his small community, but also as a temptation, an open invitation, for convicts to desert and strike for their freedom! He was too gentlemanly, too courteous, too considerate to breathe a word of such suspicions, while they were mere suspicions, except that he allowed, in an indirect way, the uneasiness he felt to be reflected in his correspondence with the home authorities. In several despatches he urged the British Government to anticipate any such French designs by forming small settlements along the coast at a few favourable localities; and in one communication he asserts that if he had officers suitable for the purpose, he might be inclined to take upon himself the responsibility of forming without delay one or two small subsidiary settlements of that kind ' 1 Quoted, Rusden's History of Australia, p. 326."], [67, "THE FIRST ATTEMPTED SETTLEMENT. 47 Baudin and his ships had scarcely left Port Jackson, when King heard a rumour that he had not been put in possession of some facts known to his officers, which would have converted his suspicion into a certainty. It was said that Colonel Patterson, the military commandant of the settlement, had obtained positive information on the subject. Between that officer and the Governor there had for some time existed a coolness, which in the case of Patterson degenerated into a somewhat spiteful feeling; and he failed to communicate to the Governor the fact that some of the French officers had, in conversation, explicitly avowed their intention of returning to found a settlement on Storm Bay in Van Diemen's Land, and had given him a singularly careful chart of that inlet, too careful, and too full of details as compared with the rest of the coast, to be a mere chart of discovery. On being formally questioned as to these points, Patterson admitted them, and sent to King the chart he possessed of Storm Bay, whereupon the Governor resolved to lose no further time, but to act without waiting for advice from England, and to make detailed examinations of such parts of the southern coasts as were likely to be useful for the purpose he had in view. A small schooner called the Cumberland, that in which, a year later, Flinders sailed to the Mauritius, was prepared for this service. The command of her was given to a smart young fellow of only twenty-one years of age, Charles Robbins, the master's mate of H. M.S. ship Buffalo. Colonel Patterson was requested to supply a detachment of soldiers under a captain, in order that a small force might, if necessary, be left in possession at any spot chosen for settlement. But the real command of the expedition belonged to Charles Grimes, the Surveyor-General of New South Wales, who had acted in that capacity for over eleven years. He was instructed to follow Baudin, and present to him a letter, in which King asserted the British sovereignty, not only over all Australia, but also over Van Diemen's Land, even though the latter was now distinctly proven to be a separate island; and Robbins was directed to see that the British flas? was erected wherever the French should land in the remainder of their voyage. Grimes was to survey and report on King's Island, Port Phillip and Storm Bay; and in order that the report might be more complete in regard to the contemplated settlement, an emancipated convict named James Flemming, whose behaviour had been such as to recommend him highly to the Governor, was sent to report on the quality of the soil at these places, he being reckoned somewhat of an expert in agricultural matters. So the little Cumberland, on the 23rd Xovember, 1802, left the frowning heads of Port Jackson on her memorable voyage.2 A pleasant voyage, marred by nothing more than a few tantalizing calms, brought the little ship in about a fortnight to King's Island, where Baudin's ships were seen at anchor in Elephant Bay, the officers being established in tents on shore. Robbins and Grimes at once presented their letters, and Robbins informed Captain Baudin that Governor King intended to found settlements on each side of Bass Straits, as soon as the return of H.M. ship Porpoise from Tahiti should place at his disposal a sufficient force. Baudin was guarded in his reply, and in the letter he sent to Governor King, he disclaimed all knowledge as to what the Government of the French Republic might or might - The authority for the facts of this voyage is the report written by Flemming, and published in 1S79 by the Victorian Government, under the editorship of Mr. John J. Shillinglaw. Governor King directed Robbins, Grimes and Flemming, each to write his own report, and doubtless they did so; but Flemming's is the only one now known to be in existence. It was discovered, along with Grimes's original chart of Port Phillip, by Mr. Shillinglaw in 1S77, after a protracted search in the Colonial Secretary's office at Sydney. Too much credit can scarcely be given to Mr. Shillinglaw for his ardour and self sacrificing zeal for our early chronicles. Vol. I. H"], [68, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 48 not do ; but, at the same time, he took pains to make it plain that the English were not the original discoverers of Van Diemen's Land at any rate, and so had no prior claim to that island. The conduct of Baudin throughout seems to have been sincere and honourable. Robbins went ashore and hoisted the English flag just behind the French tents, a proceeding which annoyed excessively the fiery republicans on board the Geographe; but \"Citoyen Baudin,\" courteous as gallant, refused to quarrel with his late hosts, and in return only asked the two leaders, Grimes and Robbins, to dine with him, once on board and once at his tent. The Geographe sailed on New Year's Day, 1803. Baudin did not live to develop the scheme he was said to be charged with, for he died at the Mauritius on his way home, and when the other members of the expedition returned to France, they found the condition of that country greatly altered during their absence. They had left it a republic ; they found it under the dominion of Napoleon, and soon afterwards the whole resources and genius of the nation were required to meet the great coalition of England, Russia, Austria, and Sweden, that threatened to overwhelm the empire. So no more was heard of the settlements of French in Australia ; they were too busy nearer home. After the French had left King's Island the Cumberland circumnavigated it, and for about five weeks the party landed and made excursions, often lasting several days, across the island and round its shores, acquiring a most complete idea of its soil and capabilities ; their report as to its fertility was by no means unfavourable, but they considered it a place of difficulty and danger for shipping, Elephant Bay being the only approach to a safe harbour, and that very indifferent. The Cumberland then steered her course for Port Phillip, and, after a two days' run, there was seen in the shore an opening like the entrance to a river. This was on the afternoon of the 20th of January, 1803, and at eight o'clock in the evening they were safely anchored within it, under the shores of Sorrento ; while over the broad waters of the bay came a hot and languor-breathing north wind, greeting them as it has since then greeted so many thousands of visitors to our shores. On the following day, Friday, the vessel was taken a mile or two further in, so as to lie very near the site of the present Sorrento hotels ; while Grimes, Flemming, and the surgeon, McCallum, went ashore to look at the country. They were the first to take that stroll now so much favoured by holiday-makers: from the inner beach at Sorrento to the fine amphi theatre-like stretch of sand called the \" Back Beach,\" whereon tumble the never-ending rollers of the Southern Ocean. It seems like looking back into an ancient world to take a peep at these visitors in knee-breeches, and stockings and buckled shoes ; in high stocks and great cravats, and frilled shirt fronts, and cut-away coats all ablaze with gilded buttons, plodding on, over their ankles in the soft sand-hills, or forcing their way through scrubs of the golden wattle and the honeysuckles. Saturday was spent in again exploring the land close at hand, while Robbins was busy sounding to find a course up the bay; and on Sunday the Cumberland was carried up to Arthur's Seat which was ascended and yielded a fine view of the whole district. While rowing back to the ship they received a salutary warning against rash bathing, for a shark sprang from the water and took off a coat which a seaman had hung over the gunwale of the boat. On Monday they explored all the Dromana district, and on Tuesday examined the hills that lie round about. On Wednesday the)- started earl)- on a longer trip, intending to"], [69, "THE FIRST ATTEMPTED SETTLEMENT. 49 cross by land to Western 'Port, which they had seen from the top of Arthur's Seat. It was a long walk there and back again, making not less than twenty-five miles in a straight line, and, turned from their course as they were by swamps and thicket-covered hills, it must certainly have been not less than thirty miles, under a burning sun, and with no fresh water. On their way back the doctor, McCallum, gave in, and lay down declaring he could go no further. A man was left with him, and the rest of the party pushed on for the vessel, intending to return with water to him. He did not wait for this, but sent off the man that had been left with him to look for water, and shortly afterwards himself set out to find his way to the ship, but soon was lost in the sultry bush. The man returned in safety, but it was two days before McCallum was recovered, greatly reduced by his sufferings. These two days had been spent solely in exertions to find their new-chum doctor, who was a wholly inexperienced bushman. But on Saturday a systematic survey of the whole port was commenced ; the first yet undertaken. Robbins had received from Governor King a copy of each of the charts brought back by Murray and Flinders, and had been instructed to make the outline complete and detailed. He was not to content himself with a mere marine survey ; but was expected to examine the land for a mile or two inland all round the harbour. Robbins and Grimes now commenced this task in a methodic fashion. Each day the Cumberland was to move six or eight miles along the shore; in the morning she was to land Robbins, Grimes and Hemming, and after a week of recover)- the doctor also, attended by three or four marines or seamen, and after these had spent the day in roving about and seeing all that was to be seen, while working slowly along the shore, the)- were to be received on board again in the evening. Their first day's work after this manner was on and around Mount Martha; and their second carried them through the district now occupied by the town of Mornington at Schnapper Point. On this day they reached the creek near Frankston, and spent their afternoon exploring it some six or seven miles up; during their work the)- had a meeting with fourteen of the natives, who were accompanied by their wives and children ; the interview was without alarming incident. The blacks accepted some biscuit, some old hats and a handkerchief, and seem to have been in a begging frame of mind, but quite devoid apparently of any hostile intention. On Monday they took up the exploration, going from Frankston along the beach to Mordialloc, but were prevented by the Carrum swamp behind them from going an)' distance inland."], [70, "50 VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. The weather being broken with showers the)- went aboard about mid-day, but on Tuesday they were again at work under a blazing sky, tracing their survey from Mordialloc through the tea-tree thickets, up to the shores where now the mansions, churches, shops and towers of Brighton make all the scene look populous. There our friends in uniform started a pair of large emus among the silent woodlands, and chased them through these Brighton solitudes. On Wednesday, 2nd February, the Yarra was for the first time seen by the white man; on that day Grimes, Robbins, McCallum and Flemming landed on the sandy soil, among that lonely tea-tree scrub which is now the St. Kilda esplanade, and after a walk of a mile or so came in sight of the swamp which has since been turned into the Albert Park Lake. On they went along a flat sandy waste till the)- came to a small sheet of saltwater, now known as the Sandridge Lagoon, and so to the banks of an important river. These modest discoverers affixed no names, and in Flemming's report it is referred to only as the Great River, or the Freshwater River. They walked up the bank for a mile in hopes of finding a fording place, but the river was much too broad to offer any signs of such accommodation. They had therefore to wait till the Cumberland arrived, for she came along very slowly, sounding all the way, at about a mile from the shore. So they sat down for lunch among the reeds that covered the level ground under the shade of tea-trees, and looked across a placid reach of a winding river, busy with the varied toils and sports of swan and duck and pelican. Before them on the other side rose the grassy hills where Footscray now rears its chimneys. It was not till late in the afternoon that the Cumberland cast anchor at the mouth of the river, after coasting along by the barren promontory which is now covered by the docks and wharves and buildings of Williamstown : so their work for the da)- was done, and they doubtless sought their crowded berths below with plentiful hopes for the morrow. The discovery of a fine river would put a new face on their mission to find a place suitable for a settlement, as it must have been abundantly clear that up to this time the)7 had seen no site that could be recommended. Next morning at six they were ready for their start ; the boat was got out with five seamen to form its crew, and Robbins, Grimes and Flemming set off to explore the river. After sailing two or three miles on a broad and sluggish current, lined with tea-tree scrub on either bank, they reached a place where two branches joined. They saw nothing to indicate which was the main stream, and chose that to the left, which is now called the Saltwater River ; after rowing a little way they landed on a hill, close by the site of the Flemington racecourse; a walk of a couple of miles took them to the Moonee Ponds, and then they returned to the river, noticing some good soil by the way. In their boat they again stemmed the easy current, stopping by the way at a little freshwater rill to dine. In the afternoon they reached the bend where Braybrook now stands, and there a line of rocks across the stream impeded the further progress of the boat ; but they landed and walked about two miles further inland, over flat-topped hills of stony soil, and almost treeless. From one of the summits they gained a fine view of the Macedon ranges, dark with their covering of unbroken forests. On returning they fonud it too near sunset to think of reaching the vessel, and as the stream was quite fresh above the rocky bar, they resolved to camp there for the night. In spite of a heavy thunder shower, they contrived to make themselves comfortable with a good fire. Next morning all were up at day-break and ready for a start at six o'clock. They dropped down the stream again to the place where the two branches united, and there they turned up the other, which they soon perceived to be the main stream. After rowing two or three miles they- landed at the foot of a pretty little hill, and, while dinner was bcin<>-"], [71, "THE FIRST ATTEMPTED SETTLEMENT. 51 prepared on the river banks, Robbins, Graves, and Flemming ran up to the top and viewed the prospect. There, in front of them, to the east, the gently-swelling hills and the shallow valleys lay basking in the heat of a February sun away to the haze-covered horizon, and all was wooded with sombre woods. At the foot of the slope a line of denser trees, and the green of the golden wattle, showed where a rocky gull)- ran, whose bed was a little stream. That gully now is Elizabeth-street. The person who nowadays stands on the same spot and looks in the same direction, takes in the long prospect of Bourke-street, dipping down to the Post Office and slowly rising on the opposite hill to the grey-looking mass of the Parliament Houses; and all that wooded expanse whereon the)' then gazed is now an undulating surface of roof-tops, and chimneys, and steeples, and towers. Behind them, glimmering in the midday sun, lay the West Melbourne swamp, surrounded by meadows of rich black soil whereon the grass stood long and ripe like a field of corn. And the hill whereon they stood, with the grass waving over their knees, is now the site of a great railway station. When they had dined they again embarked, and pulled leisurely up for a couple of miles on the glassy stream ; past the overhanging gums and the pendent wattles ; past the mouth of the little gully, and up to the little rapid, where now the first bridge spans the stream. There they stopped while Flemming took a ramble to examine the soil. How lonely seems to us that solitary stroll over the yellow grass and under the gnarled gum-trees of Melbourne, and the she-oak glades of Carlton, and the tea-tree thickets of Fitzroy ; sleepy, but filled with the drowsy buzz of the summer woods at noontide. In the afternoon they all gathered again at the boat, and now, with the current in their favour, pulling together with their stiff, straight oars, flinging the dark waters up with a will, we may imagine the blue-shirted tars, putting on all speed to reach their vessel, frightening the pelicans as they went past, and driving the natives from two huts upon the banks and from their frail bark canoe among the reeds. They got on board just after dark, and next day was spent as a holiday, except that Robbins took his water-casks up in a boat to have them refilled with fresh water. The next day was Sunday, and was not spent in any serious work. They merely strolled among the park-like lands that now are covered by the streets of Melbourne ; but on Monday business was resumed in earnest. Starting from the ship at daybreak, they breakfasted on Batman's Hill, now occupied by West Melbourne. Then, pushing up along the tortuous stream, through what are now the Botanic Gardens, they reached the mouth of the Gardiner's Creek, below the sunny slopes that are now crowned by the mansions of Toorak. There they rested and dined, and then on again round all the windings that lie, between Toorak and Hawthorn, scaring some natives by the way. Pleasant meadow lands lay on cither side, but the river was fringed with gum, and wattle, and honeysuckle, whose branches, strewn with grass, and leaves, and debris, told a talc of heavy winter floods. They rowed till sunset, then lighted their fire, and encamped for the night amid those Arcadian surroundings, not far from the present Hawthorn Bridge. In the morning they pursued their course, but now they found the banks grow higher; on the right side they rose in steep, sometimes almost precipitous slopes, that showed the lines of freestone strata. The river took a remarkable bend round what is now the Studley Park, and then their course was stopped; a bar of stone ran across the current, forming a fall of several feet in height, over which it was useless to think of lifting their clumsy boat. At this spot, now called Dight's Falls, the crew stopped, while the leaders went half-a-mile inland, and ascended a little hill. Robbins then climbed a tree, and looked out on a scene"], [72, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS : PAST AND PRESENT. 52 of unbroken woodland, stretching twelve or fifteen miles around on every hand ; wood-clad hills, and tree-filled hollows. In the afternoon they drifted pleasantly back down the shady stream, but landed again near Batman's Hill. There Flem ming went ashore alone, and rambled for a mile or two examining the soil, and meeting with seven natives, as to whom, however, he says nothing. At seven o'clock in the evening they were on board again, doubtless ready for a hearty supper. This completed their examination of the Yarra, and next morning they resumed their course round the bay. They walked through the site of Wil- liamstown and along the shores of Laverton Bay; but the wind being adverse, the Cumberland could not follow them, and they went on board soon after midday. Next morning they started along the same shore, but when they had gone some five miles, they perceived that the Cumberland was in vain struggling against a head wind, and that giving up the attempt she had brought to; so they had to walk back their five miles in order to be taken on board. As the wind was equally baffling on the next da)-, they resolved on a new plan of procedure, and on the 12th February victualled a boat with four days' provisions, which a crew was to row close to the beach while the land part)' explored the shores. Grimes, Robbins, M'Callum, Flemming, and seven men, started thus at sunrise, to commence at Point Cooke. All day the)- worked through treeless plains, well grassed, but very hot. For four more days they followed the shores down the western side of the port, discovering the Werribee and Little Rivers, and rounding Point Wilson into Corio Bay. On the evening of the fourth night they camped amid a plain so treeless that it was difficult to get wood for a small fire to cook the small remains of their provisions. When the sixth morning came there was a pound of flour left; this was boiled, and formed a breakfast for eleven men. After that was done they were without food. The Cumberland had, whenever a chance offered, worked her way down the shore, and could now be seen in the distance outside the entrance to Corio Bay. Robbins took the boat and, under sail, hastened over the shallow waters to reach the ship and procure a fresh supply. While he was gone the land part)- rounded the head of the bay, and stopped at the banks of Cowie's River. There they waited till the boat returned, when all enjoyed a hearty dinner near the present site of the Geelong Railway Junction. They had just reached the sparsely-wooded undulations of yellow grass, whereon now run the spacious streets of Geelong, when Grimes and Robbins agreed to terminate this prolonged trip. So the)- started in their boat to reach the Cumberland, and after five nights' camping under the stars were doubtless grateful for the softness even of a sailor's bunk. On the following day, the wind being more favourable, the vessel took them to the head of Corio Bay, where they landed on the shores of Geelong Harbour. As they disembarked, the)- met"], [73, "THE FIRST ATTEMPTED SETTLEMENT. 53 a party of eleven natives, whose conduct was most civil. A few things were given them, and the intercourse was pleasant enough, till in the afternoon some mean fellow among the blacks destroyed their character by stealing a few trifles from the boat. As they were not of much value, the white men took no notice, especially as a hoe, the article of most importance, was returned. On the following day the survey of the southern shores of Corio Bay was completed, and the party rounded Indented Head. Here two of the same blacks were met, and showed themselves very friendly, accepting a brass button each from Flemming's coat by way of memento. The next day, being Sunday, was chiefly devoted to rest, and on Monday the examination of the shores was carried round Swan Harbour to the peninsula of Queenscliff Thus the survey of the shores of Port Phillip was completed. Tuesday and Wednesday were occupied in finishing the sounding of the entrance. Thursday was spent in laying in supplies of wood and water for the home voyage. On Friday, Grimes and Robbins surveyed and sounded the shoal that lay right in front of the entrance to the harbour. On Saturday the Cumberland worked round to Point Nepean, and lying there at anchor was ready to sail next morning at daylight ; and a fine run of eight days landed them all safely under the old windmill in Sydney Cove. In their reports they all agreed that the Freshwater River they had explored at the head of Port Phillip was a most suitable place for a settlement, though none of them was in any way enthusiastic about the quality of the soil. But King had, during their absence, come to the conclusion that it was of primary importance to form a settlement on Tasmania, which he thought the French much more likely to occupy, seeing that it was now known to be detached from Australia. He wrote to England for instructions in regard to Port Phillip, but in the meantime prepared, on his own responsibility, to form a settlement at Storm Bay. Accordingly, Lieutenant Bowen, of H. M.S. Glutton, was sent, in June 1803, with the Lady Nelson, accompanied by a chartered vessel, the Albion, to occupy the mouth of the Derwent River. Bowen carried over his handful of soldiers and his gang of convicts, and formed a settlement at Risdon, where all things prospered. King had no intention in the immediate present of establishing any settlement at Port Phillip. But the preliminaries were now made ready. The chart that Grimes took back left nothing to be desired in the way of a survey of the port ; the soundings carried out by Robbins and his assistants covered all the bay where the water was in any way shoal, the parts left blank in Grimes' chart being absolutely free from all obstructions to navigation ; while Flemming's observations on the soil, and the careful examination of the Freshwater River, were in every way suitable to make any future attempt at settlement there of the simplest and most straightforward description. That was the natural expectation of what would be the case, but accident carried out the actual train of events in a very different order. For the Home Government had acted on King's early despatches, without waiting to receive the result of his exploration. It seems that a consignment of convicts was being prepared in the latter part of the year 1802, when the receipt of a despatch, which King had written in the May of that year, caused a considerable alteration in the arrangements that were being made. The convicts, instead of going to Port Jackson, were to be landed in Port Phillip, there to form a new settlement and so to keep possession of that inlet. A ship of war, the Calcutta, was chosen for that service, her captain, Daniel Woodriff, having already taken a number of convicts out to Sydney some years before and made"], [74, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 54 himself acquainted with the colony. Abundant provision was made for breaking the soil and commencing operations in a new country, and 299 convicts were taken on board, together with eighteen free settlers, and sixteen women, wives either of settlers or convicts. But so much space was occupied by these passengers that the Calcutta was unable to find room for the necessary stores and implements. The Government, therefore, had to charter another vessel and chose the Ocean, of 481 tons burthen, which was about to start on a voyage to China for a cargo of teas, but for a consideration, agreed to make a detour and land the stores at Port Phillip on her way out. So in the months of March and April of the year 1803, there was a busy corner at Portsmouth, where the convicts and settlers and fifty soldiers, with all their effects and the Government equipments, were being shipped on board the Calcutta and the Ocean. It is to be noticed that the Government had two subsidiary reasons for fitting out this expedition. Not only was there the political design of frustrating any projected French intrusion from the Mauritius, but there were also commercial objects in view. First it was hoped that the new territory would supply a quantity of that large, curved sort of timber required to make the ribs of vessels. The British Government was then looking forward to a renewal of the struggle with the French, in which the Peace of Amiens was but a temporary lull. It was well known that the primary struggle would be for the dominion of the seas, and that that struggle would have decisive results, a forecast which the battle of Trafalgar, some two years later, amply justified. With the prospect of a great maritime contest just at hand (and indeed it commenced less than a month after the Calcutta sailed), the English Government desired to commence ship-building on a scale never before attempted, but found an initial difficulty in the fact that the ancient oak trees, of which the ribs of her great line of battle ships had been made for centuries, were now hard to find ; and from the reports of Flinders and others, it was considered not unlikely that the limbs of the fine gum trees of the south of Australia would provide timbers of sufficient size, of the proper shape, and of even more durability than the oaken boughs, so long used in England. Hence the captain of the Calcutta was directed to return to England as soon as possible with a cargo of knee-timbers suitable for shipbuilding. The free settlers were induced to join the expedition, mainly by reason of the second commercial object. There was every reason to believe that Bass's Strait was the home of untold myriads of seals; Flinders had seen them disporting themselves among the kangaroos on Kangaroo Island. Grant and Murray had seen them by thousands at the entrance to Western Port, and one navigator estimated the number seen at one glance at Elephant Bay in King Island as at least five thousand. Hence the encouragement of the settlers to 0-0 out and prosecute an enterprise that was beginning to show signs of collapse in the northern hemisphere. The new settlement was not to be independent, but it was to have a Lieutenant- Governor, acting under instructions from Sydney. The gentleman chosen for this post was David Collins, who had accompanied the first fleet to Sydney, had remained there some years and returned to England, where his well-known book had given him a considerable standin\"*. He thus had some experience in the foundation of a convict settlement, and beino- moreover a colonel in the Royal Marines, and so able to command the small military force that was requisite, there was no hesitation in giving him the appointment.

With him he took the easy-goino-,"], [75, "THE FIRST ATTEMPTED SETTLEMENT. 55 comparatively illiterate, but essentially jovial and good-hearted parson, the Rev. Robert Knopwood, as chaplain, at a salary of ios. per day ; a surgeon at the same rate, while the surveyor and the mineralogist to the settlement were to receive only seven shillings and sixpence per day. David Collins, in whom was vested the whole responsibility of the expedition, was a man of no little ability, but vain and self-important; not by any means a strict disciplinarian, and being a trifle over-inclined to that cheerful glass, which promotes geniality but destroys respect, he made on the whole only a moderately efficient guardian of a community whose weaknesses required to be held peculiarly in check. In his daily orders, the Lieutenant- Governor is for ever lecturing his troops on their unsteadiness, due to excess of spirit, and preaching to the convicts as to the terrible sin of drunkenness, but there is reason to believe that both soldiers and convicts laughed at him, as well as his chaplain, and told many a good story of the festive pair that did not promote the discipline of the little community. However, the British Government relied on the discretion of the Governor, and conscious that the expedition was being sent out somewhat precipitately, gave him full permission to choose any place he preferred to Port Phillip, if, on experience, that inlet did not answer to the expectations of Flinders and Murray. So the Calcutta and the Ocean swung down the English Channel, and bade farewell to Britain on the 26th April, 1803, just two months after Grimes had left Port Phillip Heads, and of course long before the news of his exploration could reach London.3 A stiff gale tossed them roughly on their way out to the Atlantic, but calmer weather succeeding, the people settled down to the monotony of a long voyage. Mr. Tuckey tells us that most of the convicts viewed their fate with indifference, but a few of better birth and education than the rest were long unable to raise their heads from the disgrace that bowed them down. Two died on the passage across, and the fate of one poor lady, who also died, touched deeply the heart of the susceptible lieutenant. She was the wife of one of the better class of prisoners, and had nobly resolved to share with him the disgrace and exile that his weakness had brought upon him; but the strain of the trial and conviction, of days of anxiety and nights of weeping, had been too severe, and her worn-out body was consigned to the deep ere they reached Teneriffe. The expedition called in at Rio Janeiro; and many who had till then taken little interest in what was going forward around them, were wakened out of their stupor by the sight of that wonderful harbour, winding away up among the magnificent hills, palm clad, and delighting the eye with their wealth of tender greens, and the blaze of their gorgeous flowers. Therein lay charming islets, on which the groves of orange trees laden with the golden fruit were a delicious novelty to these northern exiles, and Collins, solicitous for the sanitary condition of his charge, rented one of these islands at a charge of four pounds a day, in order safely to allow some of his people to stretch their legs on shore, but more particularly to provide for the washing of the linen. The women were landed under the charge of a 3 There are several authorities for the facts of this voyage. I.

It was a pleasant interlude of three weeks, and then came another month of ocean till they anchored at the Cape, where a supply of live stock was taken in for the young colony. Then seven weeks across the southern seas till on the 8th October they were close to the shores of King's Island. There they would willingly have anchored, but that iron coast offered no shelter, the soundings were of great depth, and a wild gale came on that split their sails and sent the seas lashing over deck and poop. It was no place to linger in, and they stood away to the north ; it was a wild night, and the ships laboured heavily, but with daybreak came a calmer wind ; as the sun rose higher the storm died away, and when in the distance they saw the silver break that marked the entrance to Port Phillip, there was nothing but the rolling swell on the sea to indicate the night of fury that had passed. All that have left their impressions of that first view of the coast, speak of it as extremely beautiful, and doubtless so it was under these circumstances. The broken water at the entrance, which we call the Rip, alarmed the seamen for a time, lest it should somewhere conceal a reef, but without mishap they glided in and found themselves in perfectly calm water under the lee of Point Nepean. Tuckey declares that the face of the country bordering on the port is beautifully picturesque, swelling into elevations of the brightest verdure and dotted with trees as if planted by the hand of taste. At a mile off these pleasant shores the Calcutta glided along over the unruffled bay, and came to an anchor near the present site of Sorrento. On the following day several parties went ashore to search for a stream of fresh water, if such were to be found. Those who kept to the neighbourhood of their anchorage brought back a very unfavourable report, but Collins and Woodriff, who landed under Arthur's Seat and went to the top of that hill, found a pleasant stream with enough of water to suit all purposes,' but the approach to the shore was shallow, and the surrounding soil too sandy. From the very beginning, Collins seems to have been prejudiced against the port. There was undoubtedly a certain amount of reason for that seeling. There is very little soil round Port Phillip suitable for the growth of wheat, and in those days that was regarded as the matter of prime importance. No one had as yet suggested that Australia might offer wealth to the sheep farmer, and the splendid grazing land that bordered the harbour almost everywhere was regarded as only a poor sort of country. Many places they visited have since been shown to be admirably adapted for fruit growing, but for that they had no thought in those days ; corn to make bread was the one thing to be desired, and they made up their minds that this country was hopelessly unsuited for that purpose ; as if a man, landing on the granite coasts of Cornwall, were to condemn the whole of Great Britain as beiti\" valueless for agriculture! But there is indirect evidence that Collins was from the first, even before he sailed from England, disinclined to choose Port Phillip. The scenery around Storm Bay is undoubtedly more charming, and the general impression given by the land there, is on the whole more favourable from an agricultural point of view than that around Port Phillip. Besides this, the climate of Australia was warmer than these colonists cared for, and Knopwood is constantly chronicling the ominous height of the \" therrnomiter \" as he always spells it. 'Collins' report, as printed in Labilliere I., p. 131."], [77, "THE FIRST ATTEMPTED SETTLEMENT. 57 Collins spent two days in searching for fresh water on the Queenscliff side of the entrance, but found none. Three days having gone in fruitless examinations, and the cost of retaining the ship Ocean in port being from day to day a formidable item, he resolved to land the stores where he was, and so permit her to be gone on her way to China. A small bay was chosen about eight miles from Point Nepean between the points now called The Sisters.5 There the landing of the people was soon effected, and on a clear, but somewhat sandy space of about five acres the tents were pitched in three or four groups. Among the first duties on landing, was the burial of the first white man ever interred in Victorian soil, John Skilhornc, a consumptive cutler from London. Under a gum tree a copper was erected for cooking; and a few men were detailed to cut firewood, while the rest, clad only in a pair of trousers each, waded laboriously backwards and forwards from the beach to the boats which plied between the Ocean and the shore, to which they could not approach nearer than a quarter of a mile. Barrels of biscuit, flour, and salt provisions were heaped in great piles in the open air, while the kegs of wine and spirit, together with all the bales of merchandise, were gathered under three large marquees, and guarded by a body of twelve privates and two non-commissioned officers. Three weeks were employed in the task of unloading the Ocean, and on the 4th November she was discharged from His Majesty's service; but Captain Mertho was not, of course, prepared to sail for some time, till he had completed ballasting and watering his vessel, and for a fortnight she still lay at anchor. On shore the scene was a busy one. The convicts coming and going, the guards \u2014 those stolid British youths \u2014 patrolling with fixed bayonets round the tents, or before the wells, which were formed of five casks let into the soil and fitted with lids, which were locked down at night, but left open during the da)-; for, to prevent wilful pollution by the convicts, they could not be left unguarded while day lasted. Then there were the female convicts all day at the tubs washing and spreading the linen to dr)' on the bushes or hanging them on lines between the gum trees; and ere long two fires with great coppers were kept burning for the general cooking, while half-a-dozen smaller ones prepared the swan or the ducks and peas, or the occasional kangaroo, for the officers' tables. At seven o'clock the taptoo was beat upon the drum, and all the toils of the day came to an end. Then rose the cheerful hum of the evening meal, and in various ways the twilight hour was spent while darkness deepened and the tents began to shine with the lights inside. At eight once more the taptoo was beat, and the settlement was supposed to sink to rest. No light was permitted after nine \u2014 so said the regulations \u2014 but in many a tent the candles were furtively lit; and, while in the moonlight outside the red-coats marched up and down and studiously failed to see any breach of orders, while the parole and countersign from time to time broke the silence with their monotonous cadence, there, within, sat the convicts gambling for pence, or clothes and stores ; and at times the British soldier would put his head in to take a peep, or perhaps venture a sixpence, taking care to pass the word if any officers were at hand. At sunrise the beat of drums called out all the settlement on the shore, and work was briskly carried on till eight, when half-an-hour was allowed for breakfast; then once more to work until noon, when an hour was allowed for dinner; and finally a long spell of five or six hours of labour, till the sun had set. On the second Sunday after their landing the soldiers were drawn up in line, and the convicts gathered in mass to join in a thanksgiving service for their safe arrival; and on the 5 Gurner's Chronicle of Port Phillip."], [78, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 58 following morning the practice was begun of serving out to each his weekly rations \u2014 seven pounds of beef, seven pounds of biscuit, one pound of flour, and six ounces of sugar, and to each of the military in addition half a pint of spirits daily, which the Governor found it necessary to water carefully; and, indeed, to water more and more carefully, as he observed the unsteady aspect of his troops when the morning parade beat at nine o'clock, just after the issue of their cheering cup. On the 30th October the convicts were mustered to receive their half-year's supply of clothing, and four days later each was provided with a wooden bowl, a platter, and a spoon, of which the Lieutenant-Governor trusted they would take the greatest care, as they must be aware that everything was being done to make them comfortable.\" Meanwhile, lanes had been cut through the bush, and rough roads formed, on which two or three clumsy waggons were used for dragging timber to the settlement, some for the purpose of erecting log huts, the rest to be loaded on board the Calcutta, as part of a cargo for England. Under a spreading gum tree a small printing press had been set up, and there were struck off day by day the Governor's orders for the regulation of his little community. He was greatly concerned that in spite of his fatherly care of them, first three, and then five others of the convicts escaped into the woods. They had formed the absurd notion of walking to Port Jackson, but five were afterwards caught, and on 17th November, when a general muster was made to hear the chaplain read the Governor's commission, the ceremony of the day was concluded by the flogging of these five in the centre of the camp. A few days later the three others returned and gave themselves up; but in consideration of the wretched plight in which they dragged themselves into the camp, the Governor forbore the infliction of any further punishment. Meantime, Collins knew very well that the spot on which he was landing his party was quite unsuitable for permanent occupation. He chose it only out of some ridiculous notion about requiring to be near the entrance of the port ; and while he was putting the little settlement in order, Captain Woodriff was left to explore the other shores to the north. This work seems to have been done in a most slovenly manner. If a copy of Grimes's chart had been present in the settlement, it might have materially altered the course of events, but to any one reading with care the reports of the different exploring parties of the Calcutta, it is plain enough that though they spent weeks in their pretended search, not one of them saw the Yarra, or the Werribee, or the Little River. Several references occur to a freshwater river twenty-eight miles from the entrance, on the east side of the port, and from this stream the Calcutta took fifty-five tons of fresh water in her casks. This stream has been inadvertently identified with the Yarra, but there seems no reason for doubting that the small rivulet they thus employed, the most important they could find round Port Phillip, was the Cananook Creek at Frankston. In the clumsy report, furnished by the surveyor, Mr. Harris, it is stated that \" the northern shore is more numerously inhabited than any other parts, from which it is likely that water is to be found there, although no appearance of it was seen during the survey,\" a most astounding oversight, when two navigable streams entered the bay by a most conspicuous mouth in these same northern shores. The first exploration was made by Mr. Tuckey, the first lieutenant of the Calcutta, who took the launch and a smaller boat for that purpose, and was accompanied by Mr. Shillinglaw, p. 3,8"], [79, "THE FIRST ATTEMPTED SETTLEMENT. 59 Harris. After a nine days' trip they came back with a report that to us in these days reads like a singularly lazy production. According to both Tuckey and Harris, there were no streams on the west side, while we hear from Tuckey that he thinks there may be a river in the northern part of the port, but that shortness of time and squally weather prevented him from inquiring if there actually was one. Flinders in nine days would have compiled a chart that would have been practically complcte. Grimes, though by no means a genius, made an excellent map in a comparatives short time. Tuckey returned with some poetic sentiments, a few vague generalities, and an apology for a chart. He had found no stream of more importance than the creek at Frankston, and came back with a tale that exactly fitted in with the prejudices of the Governor. The cause of this inefficiency in his work may probably be summed up in three words: \"dread of natives.\" There was an unaccountable fear of the blacks, whom these settlers in their uncertainty regarded as of very great number and extreme ferocity; and there can be no doubt that the news of the successive arrival of Murray and Flinders and Grimes had attracted an unusual number of the natives to Port Phillip, and that the occupation of their soil by a large concourse of white men had made them jealous and suspicious. Tuckey had a memorable encounter with them on the west shore of the harbour, probably near the entrance to Corio Bay. The crews of the launch and cutter had landed and set up a tent as a sort of headquarters during the exploration of the bay. They were visited by three natives, who held some friendly conference, and were presented with fish, bread, and blankets. Tuckey soon after pulled away in one of the boats for the examination of some point that had attracted his attention, leaving the crew of the other boat to procure fresh water and cook the dinner against his return. No sooner had Tuckey gone than the three sable visitors departed, and after an hour had elapsed returned with about forty more. They were in full fighting costume, and were led by a chief of tall proportions, adorned with a necklace of pointed reeds, and strings of what the white men took to be human hair. On his head there waved a neat coronet of swan's feathers, and through the cartilage of his nose there stretched a thin bone of two feet in length, and he had his face intricately decorated with red, white, and yellow clay \u2014 altogether a most elaborate preparation, and indicative of mischief. A part of this native force surrounded the tent, wherein Mr. Harris, the surveyor, and most of the crew were busy, while another part proceeded to plunder the boat. The white men reasoned with them and tried to stop their pilfering, giving them bread, meat, and blankets as friendly offerings. But that made the aggressors bolder, and from the scrub there constantly issued by twos and threes more sable forms until a great crowd was gathered, which Tuckey estimates at 200, while other observers considered it at least 150. Tuckey approached at a critical moment, and seeing from a distance a surging and disorderly crowd, pushed forward as rapidly as possible, and observed a native trying to drag the master's mate out of the boat, and a tumultuous gathering in and around the tent. Two muskets were fired over their heads, and for a moment there was a pause, a few retreating behind the trees; but finding no harm done they sallied forth again, clapping their hands and shouting loudly. Tuckey and his crew had, however, been able to push up close to the shore, and they fired four muskets with ball and several fowling-pieces loaded with small shot into the very thickest of the crowd. A loud howl took the place of their warlike shouts; the)' dropped man)- of their furs and equipments, and disappeared behind the trees."], [80, "60 VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. Tuckey thought the adventure ended, and lest some catastrophe might at an unguarded moment occur, he struck the tent, and prepared to sail away for a quieter spot to dine in. They were still at work, when the blacks were seen descending a neighbouring hill in a compact body, each armed with a spear. There could be no doubt as to their intentions, so Tuckey drew up his men in line, their muskets loaded with ball. The natives halted, while the chief, with spear ready poised in its womerah, and followed by an attendant carrying a bundle of others, stepped angrily forward and made a long harangue. Tuckey likewise stepped forward, laying aside his gun. He returned to the chief all the cloaks, necklaces, and other articles that had been left by the natives in their flight. The man accepted them, but made no motion to retire; on the contrary, the whole band of natives now came forward, shouting, capering, and brandishing their spears at arm's length above their heads- The order was given to marines and seamen to present, and the two parties stood face to face \u2014 a line of musket muzzles, a mass of quivering spears. Tuckey hurriedly tried to let them know their danger; they listened to nothing, but came defiantly on. Tuckey did not wish to spill more blood than might be necessary; he pointed out to three marines a particular black, who in front of the rest was making himself conspicuous by his violence. They fired at once, and two of their bullets took effect in his naked body; he fell instantly dead. The rest looked at him a moment, then broke and fled ; the body was left for the white men to examine a minute before they embarked in their boats and left the angry natives to the enjoyment of their own country. This occurrence had an important bearing on the history of the settlement. The numbers of the blacks were greatly exaggerated; nowadays we know that the 200 they had at this conflict was about as large a number as they could ever have brought into the field, and that only by the gathering of half-a-dozen tribes could they have mustered so many; but to the white men there was nothing to indicate that this was not merely one of scores of similar tribes, and that they might readily enough have to encounter hosts of two or three thousands of these, naked warriors. That, no doubt, was the real cause why the northern shores of Port Phillip were not more carefully examined, for there, it was believed, the natives were in very large numbers. Collins, though a colonel of marines, was not a fighting man ; and he shared with his associates a particular horror of these ferocious cannibals. But beyond this feeling of timidity there was in fact a basis of reason in the distrust he felt of the blacks. He would have only fifty soldiers left when the Calcutta should sail, and these had to guard about 300 convicts, among whom there were a sufficient number of desperadoes to make a mutiny not at all an unlikely thing. Now if a couple of hundred of those convicts chose to strike for their freedom, he scared that he could not sufficiently rely on his soldiers, who were many of them very much of the convict class themselves, and inclined to sympathize and possibly even to fraternize with the unhappy exiles, who most of them could make out a specious talc which placed them in the light of martyrs, as indeed a few of them really were. He seems to have felt that if he could not place a perfect reliance on his own community, there might be the gravest evils to be expected if he intruded into a country crowded with ferocious natives, with whom, in spite of all he could do, the convicts might easily make common cause. He states in one of his despatches that were he to settle in the upper part of the harbour (where apparently he felt he ought to have settled), it was so full of natives that he would have required four times the force he then had to guard not only the convicts, but perhaps himself, from their attacks.7 ; Collins to Governor King, 14th November, 1803, printed in Labilliere, Vol. I., p. 132."], [81, "THE FIRST ATTEMPTED SETTLEMENT. 61 Collins was therefore anxious to be gone. Tasmania had all along been his favourite choice; but although he was himself vested with discretionary power, he felt that common courtesy demanded a reference to his superior officer at Sydney. He therefore prepared a letter for Governor King, in which he narrated all the occurrences of his expedition, and described the disadvantages of Port Phillip. Among other condemnatory opinions, he stated that the entrance to the port was so bad that it was impossible the place could ever have any commercial value. \"Every day's experience,\" he says, \"convinces me that it cannot nor ever will be resorted to by speculative men.\" Surely a man of dull insight and little enterprise! \u2014 this David Collins, who thus off-hand condemned a port that offers none but the most ordinary difficulties to navigation ; who settled down on a waterless sandy tract, as prudently near the Heads as he could, and so occupied the barest site that the bay afforded ; and who was frightened away by natives that were scarcely thought of by settlers of the truly pioneer description in after years. But not all of the little community were equally destitute of enterprise. The governor had a cousin \u2014 a Mr. Collins \u2014 in the settlement, who had been a master mariner, but had come out as a free settler, to sec what he could do in the way of sealing. This gentleman took the governor's despatches to Sydney in a voyage which for pluck and skill almost deserves to be placed alongside of that of George Bass. The Ocean had been discharged, and was ready for sea, and Captain Mertho proposed to run direct to China. Collins would have liked him to call in at Sydney with his despatches, but he declined to do so ; probably expecting a payment for that service, an expense which Collins refused to incur. On the other hand the Calcutta had still her supplies of timber to get, and, besides, Collins was afraid to be left without the protection of her guns and her marines. There was no other vessel, and in this predicament his cousin volunteered to proceed in an open boat to Sydney and there deliver the despatches. Six well-behaved prisoners accompanied him, and after a tempestuous voyage of nine days, they were within sixty miles of Port Jackson when they were overtaken by the Ocean, which after all was going to call in at Sydney, her captain's little stratagem having been intended apparently only to secure an engagement. The seven men and their boat were taken on board and carried into Port Jackson. They brought to King the first news he had had of the arrival of an expedition in Port Phillip. He agreed with Collins in his idea of transferring the settlement to Tasmania. That detached island seemed much more likely than any other part of the southern coast to be selected for a French colony, and King had himself but a month or two ago sent over Lieutenant Bowen with a very small party as a preliminary settlement; but he must have been aware that the numbers he had been able to spare were too few to make any stand either against the blacks or against even a small French force. He therefore wrote a letter concurring in Collins's proposals, and he also chartered the Ocean to return and assist in conveying the settlement to Tasmania. That vessel arrived on the 14th December, and Mr. Collins delivered to the Lieutenant- Governor the permission of Governor King to make all necessary preparations. But he also announced to Captain Woodriff that within two months of the time when he sailed from Portsmouth, war had broken out between France and England. The captain was therefore anxious to get back at once to England with his cargo of ships' timbers, and to make his vessel of use in the hostilities that were now raging. Collins urged him to remain and help to can-)- the settlement over to Storm Bay; but Woodriff refused, much to Collins's disgust, alleging, in addition, his disinclination to risk one of His Majesty's vessels now so much needed at home, in the dangerous navigation of a little-known"], [82, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 62 coast. So the Calcutta sailed for Sydney on the 1 8th, and there took in 400 logs, with which she reached the old country, after circumnavigating the world in eleven months. Just before she sailed Tuckey took a trip inland in search of some escaped prisoners, and what he saw in that expedition ought to have been a rebuke to Collins for his hasty judgment. Accompanied by several officers, and a party of convicts to carry provisions, he struck across country towards Western Port, at first over a sandy plain broken only by sandhills sparsely grown with bracken and wiry grass ; but as they approached Cape Schanck they found the ground delightful, with grass waving two feet high, and made to look like an ornamental park by evergreen shrubs and pleasantly-dotted trees. They spent the first night at a clear and rapid stream a mile or two beyond the cape, and next day reached Western Port; but the man who carried the bread having decamped, they did no more than walk four or five miles along the sandy shore, where the village of Flinders now stands. They proposed, on their way home, to follow a different road, in order to see more of the country; and accordingly, shaping their course by the compass, faced the ascent of the Arthur's Seat range from the south-west. But those seaward slopes of the hills are formidable to travel in. At first they entered a solemn grove of tall and stately bluegums, and found their journey easy and exhilarating, but ere long were stopped by the wildness of the country. The mountain dipped constantly into deep gullies with very steep sides. They had to descend difficult inclines down to where the little mountain rill found its way through ferns and mosses, under the tree-fern fronds, and then they had to climb through terrible thickets up to the summit of the rocky spur, only to plunge again into another gully. After passing eight of these in six miles, and spending four hours in the laborious and tantalising task, they abandoned the mountains, and in order to skirt them turned back towards the sea. In this walk they found well-watered land, with extremely rich soil ; many places clear of timber, forming natural meadows of fifty or a hundred acres each, with grass waving five feet high. They spent that night at Cape Schanck, and next day a walk of ten or twelve miles brought them to the settlement. They reported having seen herds of kangaroos, four dingoes, bronze-winged pigeons, and innumerable flocks of black and white cockatoos. A few days later the Calcutta cleared the Heads on her way to Sydney, and Collins was left to manage as well as he could with the Ocean and a small colonial schooner, the Francis, which Governor King sent round to assist. Meantime matters had moved forward in a very steady round at the settlement. On Christmas Day, a week after the Calcutta sailed, a public service was held, at which was christened the first child born in Victoria, the son of Sergeant Thorn. At the end of November the first wedding had taken place, when Mr. Knopwood had united Richard Garrett to Hannah Harvey. During the stay of the community at Sorrento twenty-one persons died, so that the funeral service was of unfortunate frequency, and the little cemetery \u2014 the first to be opened for the bodies of civilized men and women \u2014 grew to a noticeable size. The escape of prisoners was of frequent occurrence, and though most of them returned, looking very miserable, there were several that never were heard of. Two days after Christmas half-a-dozen of them ran into the bush, but were chased by the watch; one man was shot, and one caught. On the following day a cart was sent to bring back the wounded man, but he died a day or two after, and the others one by one dropped back into the camp, preferring to receive their floggings rather than undergo the horrors of the bush. On the 16th December Collins had announced in one of those garrison orders printed under the gumtrcc near the beach, that preparations were to be begun for transferring the"], [83, "TLLE FLRST ATTEMPTED SETTLEMENT. 63 settlement to Tasmania. That no time might be lost he directed that there should be no cessation of work on the Sunday. Two gangs of fifteen men each were appointed to supervise and hasten on the task, in order that all of them might the sooner be able \"to leave this unpromising and unproductive country.\" In order to be no more interrupted in that work, he announces on the last day of 1803 that he will no longer send to look for absconding prisoners, but leave them to perish or return as they please. Then for the next three weeks we must imagine them busy loading, as before they had been busy unloading; and at length, on the 24th of January, the Ocean had taken all she could, and on board of her went 120 convicts, with twenty marines to guard them. Two days before this the Lady Nelson had arrived to assist in the removal, and on board of her went the free settlers. On the 30th of January the wind was fair, and the two vessels stood out through the Heads, bearing about half the settlement to their new destination \u2014 the mouth of the Derwent River \u2014 which they reached in twenty days. It took a month for the Ocean to discharge, and twenty-four days to return to Port Phillip, where Lieutenant Sladden, who had been left in charge, had succeeded in managing the affairs of the settlement according to its old routine with no mishap, except the appearance of scurvy, due to the want of fresh provisions for so long a time. The remainder of the convicts and marines were taken on board ; then, after a tempestuous voyage of thirty-five days, they also reached their new quarters beneath Mount Wellington. And so the busy shore at Sorrento was again at rest; and the natives, doubtlessly, peered cautiously into the silent scene, with wells abandoned and tracks unused; with beach and grass strewn with the debris of civilization; but Port Phillip, for thirty years longer, was to be but the lonely haunt of the naked savage. Before Collins left he gave the convicts warning that if any were absent in the woods when the time of sailing, approached, there would be no delay on this account, and that if any had to be left behind, theirs must be the blame. Notwithstanding this warning, when the Ocean was ready to start on her second trip there were three men missing, who had absconded two or three months before and had not yet returned. Their story is of no great historical importance, but has in it an amount of romance which has made it a favourite with colonists. They wandered away round the bay, having some vague notion of perhaps reaching Sydney. They had a kettle with them and a small quantity of food, which sufficed to carry them as far as the Yarra.\" There the)- had to find for themselves a sorry subsistence of shellfish, and such small edible things as they could discover; and with these as their only sustenance they seem to have wandered on from day to day round the port, round Corio Bay, and so to Queenscliff. There they saw the Calcutta lying at anchor three or four miles off, but were unable, either by fires or by signals, to attract the attention of the crew. They then parted company. Two of them thought it best to return by the way they had come and to surrender at Sorrento. But they were nevermore heard of. One named Buckley declined to follow- them, and was left alone to some weeks of solitary wandering. At length, worn out with journeying to and fro and spent for want of food, he seated himself on a ' The chief authority for the main facts of the story of Buckley is Mr. Morgan, who in his \"Life and Adventures of Buckley\" has compiled a romance somewhat after the Robinson Crusoe style; but as he was well acquainted with Buckley, and professed to have obtained from him all the main particulars of his story, we may accept the outline as genuine enough, more especially as it has been checked by documentary and other evidence, and not in any serious point invalidated.

Sitting thus, he was discovered by the native tribe who were the friends of the departed warrior, and they, with a childish impulse characteristic of the aboriginal, jumped to the conclusion that here was their dead companion returned from the world of shades. With them he dwelt, but for how many years he was unable to say, as he lost all reckoning of time. Murders, affrays, and tedious marches filled the years; but occasionally when he chose to live by himself he was unmolested by the natives, from whom he had acquired the art of finding food in the bush. Once or twice he had an opportunity of seeing the crew of a vessel, but either his constitutional lethargy or their suspicions of him as a supposed native prevented his approaching near enough to obtain a conversation with them, and so the monotonous years rolled by while he for a generation was the only white man inhabiting the soil of Victoria, though, occasionally, the sealers who made the islands in Bass's Straits their headquarters ran for shelter to the inlets, or visited the coasts at times in their search for seals and sea-elephants. WILLIAM BUCKLEY,"], [85, "THE EXPEDITION OF HUME AND HOVELL CHAPTER V Zhc Exploration of IDtctoria. OR twenty years the history of Victoria lapses back into the unchronicled era of the forest wanderers; no white man lived upon her soil with the sole exception of the outcast Buckle)*, who was in truth absorbed into the number of its savage inhabitants, and was in no way a representative of a superior race. For twenty years the story of Victoria glides on a mere tale of seasons that came and seasons that went, while her dusky tribes, like the rest of her fauna, lived and died without record. But in 1824 it again had a little link to join it to the history of the civilized world \u2014 when an expedition of intrepid discoverers for the first time crossed it, and reported what manner of country lay inland from its coasts. On the arrival of Governor Brisbane to take charge at Sydney in 1 821, he was surprised to find how very little had been done to explore the great continent, of which the British nation had made itself the possessor. From Sydney as a centre there was a semi-circle of perhaps two hundred miles radius whose geography was known ; but beyond that the whole interior of the continent which was then ceasing to be called New Holland, and to receive its new name of Australia, was wholly unknown. He desired to signalise his period of office by discovering some great and navigable river, which he was sure must somewhere exist in so great an extent of land. In particular he was surprised that the southern portion of the colony, round Port Phillip, should so long have been left a blank upon the map, for he had heard that there was a fine river running into the port, and trusted that other and better ones were waiting to be discovered."], [86, "66 VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. He formed the idea of causing a party of well-behaved convicts to be carried round by a vessel to the shores of Bass's Strait, there to be landed with directions to strike northward for Sydney, observing the geographical features they should pass upon the way. A party of that sort would doubtless work hard, and show some daring in order to obtain their liberty, which was to be granted them so soon as they should reach Sydney. But a suitable leader was requisite, and every recommendation pointed to Mr. Hamilton Hume, a native of the colon)-, born twenty-seven years before at Parramatta. This young man had always been an ardent bushman, and at the early age of seventeen had gone with his brother and a black boy on several voluntary explorations, when tracts of fine land were added by his discoveries to the squatting areas of the colon)-. He had attracted so much attention in these trips, that he was requested to accompany Mr. Meehan, the surveyor, in certain more extensive expeditions, in which Lake Bathurst and the Goulburn Plains were discovered. There was probably no one in the colon)- of more experience as a bushman, and for zeal and enterprise it was impossible to find his equal in regard to that kind of work.' So the offer was made to Mr. Hamilton Hume, who was then residing on a small farm, endeavouring to turn his energies to more profitable account so far as concerned his own individual interests. He heard the Governor's plan ; learnt that he was to be landed on the south shores of Australia with three men and two bullocks trained to carry packs, and supplied with plenty of provisions ; that he was then to find his way to Sydney. He declined. He was then asked by the Governor to describe the course he would himself prefer. He demanded six men, and six pack horses ; with these he would start from Lake George on the outskirts of the settled districts of New South Wales, and he undertook if properly provisioned to reach Western Port, and return to Lake George. To this plan the Governor assented, but after some delay announced that he could not spare so many horses. Some time afterwards a gentleman named Hovcll, who had once been a captain of a merchant vessel, but had retired from the sea to live a squatter's life in New South Wales, hearing of the proposed scheme and its temporary delay, became fired with enthusiasm to become an explorer, and made use of some little influence he possessed to have the scheme revived, and himself included in it. Hume and he waited on the Governor, but received rather a cold encouragement, and came away disappointed. They talked the matter over between themselves, and resolved that the expedition should be carried out, though it should have to be undertaken at their own expense. They proceeded to make the necessary preparations, the Governor going the length of providing them from the stores with six pack saddles, a tent, a few utensils, fire-arms, and a pair of skeleton charts. The explorers themselves provided the horses, a pair of carts, and a supply of provisions. Hume having some difficulty in raising the sum of money requisite as his share, had to sell a fine new plough he had just bought for use on his farm. In October 1824 the party met at this farm prepared for a start. The two leaders were each attended by three convict servants, making a party of eight altogether. Their journey to Lake George and thence to the Yass Plains was easy and comfortable; three weeks after the start, they were on the banks of the Murrumbidgee, and found it a rolling and whirling stream of mountain waters, greatly flooded and swishing along at the rate of three or four miles per hour. After waiting four days for some abatement and finding none, Hume made a canoe out of Rev. William Ross's Introduction to Hume's \" Statement of Facts,\" Sydney, 1855."], [87, "THE EXPLORATION OF VICTORIA. 67 bark, but it cracked and proved useless. Hereupon the first of those quarrels occurred between the two leaders, which kept the expedition embroiled through all the rest of its journeyings. Hovel! regarding the stream as too formidable to be crossed with their cattle and baggage, was half inclined to return, or, at any rate, to merely trace the river without crossing. Hume was self-confident and opinionative; being smart and enterprising, he did not take any pains to conceal his contempt for Hovell's want of stamina. Hume regarded himself as the leader by virtue of his experience and knowledge of the bush. Hovell thought that his years and superior rank entitled him to be regarded as chief, even if he should be obliged to rely a great deal on the skill of his subordinate. Hovell was weak, yet inclined to stand on his dignity. Hume was dogmatic, and quite the reverse of conciliator)-. But this preliminary hitch was smoothed over when Hume, by imitating an ingenious contrivance he had seen on his trip with Mr. Mcehan, contrived to take the whole part)' over without mishap. He took the wheels off one of the carts, fastened the tarpaulin under the body of it, and so made a water-tight punt. Then he took with him one of the men, and they contrived to swim across, each carrying in his mouth the end of a short string, to the middle of which a fishing-line was attached. Having carried one end of this line to the opposite bank, they pullcd a rope after them, and made fast to the trees on either side; then with that as a guide, they took their improvised punt to and fro, until all their beasts and baggage were safely landed. When they had advanced a day's journey upon the other side, they found themselves hemmed in upon all sides by rugged lines of mountains; they forced their way into the heart of them, but at length were compelled to desist. The)- lay encamped for two days on a space of meadow land, seeking an outlet, and at last were forced to try the gully in which flowed the Coodradigby River. But the wildness of the country, the rocky ground, the dense and gloomy forests, made it impossible to carry with them their carts; and, loading up their pack-horses with a part of the provisions, they were obliged to leave the rest, with the carts and some of the utensils, in the depth of the forests. Travelling more lightly, they covered the ground more speedily, and crossed the Tumut River on a tarpaulin boat which Hume constructed; next morning, while the men were camped, the leaders went up the river a little to ascend a high hill they saw behind them, for the purpose of viewing the country they had to traverse. When they were half-way up a panorama greeted their eyes such as the)- had scarcely expected. For twenty miles they gazed over a wild tangle of ranges of moderate height, all covered from base to summit by eternal forests; but behind these the morning sun shone on a great semi-circle of snow-capped mountains, the highest the)- had ever seen. They were, in fact, looking forth upon what the)- named the Australian Alps, and possibly one of the glittering summits they saw, dark on its gloomy sides, but eleaminr/ with streaks of whiteness on its brow, was the peak afterwards called Kosciusko, the highest mountain of Australia. But while the view, by its magnificent beauty, roused their utmost admiration, it was also a source of embarrassment. The course they were following would certainly lead them into the very heart of that line of mountains, glorious to view, but, in all probability, impassable. Hume therefore proposed to turn to the west and avoid them. Hovell, for what reason it is difficult to guess, desired to go straight forward.\" Neither of the two seems to have had - The best authority for the narrative of this expedition is Mr. Hume's \"Brief Statement of Facts in connection with an Overland Expedition from Lake George to Port Phillip in 1824,\" Sydney, 1855. This statement being clear and accurate, has been followed throughout."], [88, "68 VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. a conciliatory temper. They had a violent and unseemly wrangle, each claiming to take the tent; it was proposed to cut it in two, but eventually Hume allowed Hovell to take it. A similar altercation arose as to which party should carry off the only frying-pan, and that useful article is related to have been broken in the violence of the altercation. They parted; but after a day's travelling, just as Hume and his men were camping for the night, Hovell and his party returned ; they had thought better of their project, and rejoined their companions. On again from day to day went the reunited party, and when they had been six weeks out, they reached a fine stream, now known to us as the Murray, but to which Hume affixed his own name, or rather, as he averred, that of his father. Again their tarpaulin-covered frame served as punt; they easily crossed this Hume River, and so stood upon what is now Victorian soil. As they had still high timber-clad ranges to the south of them, they followed the stream for two days, till they reached the Mitta Mitta River, and there camped a mile or two from the site of the modern Wodonga. Hovell objected to the notion of crossing the Mitta Mitta. Hume, after a violent explosion, and an exhibition of hasty temper, crossed with his own men, and left the others to follow or not as they chose. They chose to follow, having little confidence in their own skill. They then struck to the south-west across the Beechworth District, over the Ovens and then the Goulburn Rivers, seeing a fine range to which they gave the name of the Buffalos. For a while their progress was easy through the open park-like lands along a line where now the North-Eastern Railway follows almost exactly the track they took ; but they made a bend to the south too soon and found the country change. The forests grew high, and the scrub that filled the land beneath those forests became thick and tangled and troublesome. The land began to rise and assume a wilder aspect, and Hume was convinced that he was on the Dividing Range, not far from Port Phillip. But the country was too wild in the direction they were pursuing, which had they been successful, would have brought them direct to the head of Port Phillip. They were now in the wild ranges lying north of the Whittlesea District, and unable to make any progress; Hume one day was walking along the trunk of a fallen tree looking intently ahead for any sign of a passable opening, when he slipped and fell on a jagged limb, whose broken point entered the groin ; and by that accident he was incapacitated for a time. He had, however, been able before this to climb to the top of a high and densely wooded hill he saw from a distance. His hopes of seeing thence the ocean to the south proved vain, and calling the place that had deceived him Mount Disappointment, he guided his men slowly during his recovery back towards the Goulburn. Then striking west to the position of Kilmore, they crossed the ridge at a place where it is low and easy, reaching the site of the modern Beveridge, almost exactly by the course the railway follows now-a-days. Ere long they were in open country, then they entered the plains that lie between Bacchus Marsh and Port Phillip. A three days' journey through grassy country brought them to Corio Bay, ten or twelve miles from where Geelong now stands. On the following day they camped near the site of that city. The men for the last six or eight days had grown very much discouraged. They had lost faith in Hume's prediction that they would soon reach the sea, and could with difficulty be persuaded to continue. When they reached the beach a quarrel arose between Hume and Hovell as to the name of the sheet of water they saw before them. Hovell declared that it was Western Port; Hume asked him where were the islands that filled that inlet. He pointed"], [89, "THE EXPLORATION OF VICTORIA. 69 to the dim outline of Arthur's Seat across the water, and to the unmistakable ridge of Station Peak, or Villamanata, close behind them. He had often heard of these hills, and of the general aspect of Port Phillip during his rambles with Mr. Surveyor Mcehan, who, it will be remembered, accompanied Mr. Grimes in his visit to the place twenty years before. Hume, therefore, rightly maintained that the broad expanse of waters before them was Port Phillip ; but, again proving dictatorial rather than persuasive, the camp was rendered unsociable by the ill-temper of the leaders. \u2022 Two days were spent in resting and interviewing some of the natives; then, on the 1 8th of December, they turned their steps for home, and at evening encamped on the banks of the Werribee. Thence they made a rapid transit across country to Lake George. Their provisions were becoming scarce; time had to be economised, and Hume, abandoning their previous track, struck north-east in an almost straight line, reaching Lake George and its surrounding stations in exactly a month, having shortened the journey by 1 50 miles. They recovered their carts upon the way, and found them almost necessary, two of the men having become so completely worn out that they had to be carried in the carts for the last day or two. But all arrived in safety at Sydney. The convicts were rewarded with their freedom; Hume and Hovell obtained grants of 1200 acres each. And, certainly, they had deserved well. No trip of anything like equal extent had ever before been made in Australia. Oxley had, some six or seven years before, penetrated the western plains of New South Wales towards the Darling, and, so far, that was the only inland expedition of any consequence. But Hume had successfully carried his party three or four times as far, through regions absolutely unknown ; he had traversed lands whose aspect was as pleasant as those of Oxley had been unpromising. He had crossed the great river of Australia, having been the first white man to gaze on the full-volumed waters of the Murray; he had also discovered the Mitta-Mitta, the Ovens, and the Goulburn. He had crossed those plains, now so fertile and prosperous, whereon stand Albury and Wangaratta, Seymour and Kilmore, Kyneton and Geelong (which Hume spells \"Jillong\"), HAMILTON HUME. which then were lonely and silent, and struck fear into the hearts of some of the men by their remoteness, their stillness, and the danger of their wildernesses. Soon after the completion of Hume and Hovcll's trip to Port Phillip, there appeared on the coast of Australia a French expedition of discovery in the Astrolabe, under Captain D'Urville. This set the colonists in a flutter. What were the French doing in Australian waters? Surveying the coast? They were surveyed. Flinders had left nothing particular to be done in that way, unless on the north-west, which the French had not visited. It was clear that the French contemplated the formation of a settlement. Governor Darling recommended that his commission should be so extended as to apply to the whole continent, instead of being limited to merely the eastern half. Some correspondence ensued between the Governor and Earl Bathurst, the Colonial Secretary in London, and the result was that four settlements were immediately formed \u2014 one at Brisbane, one at Melville Island, one at King George's Sound, and one at Western Port. Only the first of these was permanent. The others were temporarily occupied and then abandoned. That at Western Port was the one on which most stress was laid at first"], [90, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 70 on account of the favourable account of these southern territories brought back by Hume and Hovell, and the former of these gentlemen was requested to go with the settlement and act as guide, for Governor Darling had adopted the idea that it was Western Port they had reached in their trip. But Hume was now very much inclined to stay at home and mind his own business, which had gone very much out of order in his long absence. He considered that Governor Darling had shown him little encouragement in his arduous trip, and taken no pains to thank him or adequately reward him for it. He declined to go, and the offer was then made to Hovell, who accepted. Captain Wright of the Buffs was selected as the commandant of the proposed settlement at Western Port, and under his control were placed eighteen soldiers and twenty convicts to occupy the post and warn the French off. Preparations were urged forward for the departure of the expedition, the warship Fly, under Captain Wetherall, being placed at its disposal for the transport of the men and animals, while a small brig, the Dragon, was loaded with provisions and all necessary supplies to last for six months. These vessels sailed on 9th November 1825, accompanied by the Amity, brig, which carried the smaller party destined to proceed still further as far as King George's Sound. The weather was wild. All three ships lost sight of each other. The Dragon was forced to take shelter at Twofold Bay, while the Fly lost some of its sheep and cattle by the severity of the weather. At last, after a voyage of sixteen days, the vessels were anchored side by side within the eastern arm of Western Port, off the shore of Phillip Island.3 Captain Wetherall fancied he could discern among the foliage of the island quite a number of European inhabitants, and soon after several nondescript creatures appeared upon the beach. They were sealers, who had been left upon the island to catch the seals, which were then so numerous. They were clad in sealskins, and had with them several black women, whom they had stolen from the mainland to be their partners in the free but lawless life of the lonely sealer. Among the trees could be seen their huts overgrown with gaudy creepers, and along the beach bounded some dogs barking at the new comers. Moving round into the shelter of the bay, some nine miles or so, the officers found a singularly lovely spot on Phillip Island, and there they determined to make a temporare settlement while examining the surrounding country for a place in all ways suitable. The pretty little meadow surrounded by its luxuriant woodlands was soon dotted by tents, and the rude huts of bark that were set up for the convicts. As the French were in the neighbouring seas, it was considered necessary to put the settlement in a position to defend itself. A flat-topped hill a little way inland was chosen as the site of a fort. It was cleared and levelled, and a pair of six-pounders hauled up the hill, to be posted beneath the flagstaff that was soon erected on the summit. There, with due formalities, the Union Jack was run up, and a long salute awoke the rolling echoes of the harbour, away up into its silent creeks and forests. The fort was named Fort Dumaresq, and proclamation made that these lands belonged to His Britannic Majesty. This place was found to be of fertile description, but disadvantageous by reason of the scarcity of water. Across the entrance on the mainland, there was the Bass River of 3 By far the best authority for this expedition is Bonwick's \"Settlement of Port rhilHp,\" which reprints all the letters and reports which appeared in the Sydney newspapers during 1826 and 1827. This would of itself make a complete and authentic narrative, but Mr. Labilliere, at the end of his first volume, has reprinted a mass of letters and reports contained in the Record Office at London ; and in the combination of these two sources of information, we possess ample and unexceptionable materials for relating the history of the effort."], [91, "THE EXPLORATION OF VICTORIA. 71 moderately abundant current, but it was salt for many miles up from its mouth, and yet too shallow, by reason of banks of sand and mud, for even a ship's boat to ascend with ease. After much scouring of both mainland and islands, a position was selected further up the port, not far from the modern township of Corinella. There a pleasant little stream and some meadow lands of promising aspect attracted their favourable regards ; their tents and huts were transferred to the new situation, and a new fort commenced. Here it was intended to remain permanently ; clay was dug out and bricks burnt for the formation of cottages ; some of the richest ground was fenced and broken with the plough, and seeds of various kinds duly sown ; while the process of unloading the Dragon went rapidly forward. There was no want of sport for those who had leisure for the gun ; for large herds of kangaroo were seen in the neighbourhood, and swans, ducks, and teal made populous all the recesses of the port, and all the marshes that lined its shores. Captain Wetherall returned to Sydney, bearing to the Governor a report that was, on the whole, of favourable tenor, while at the settlement the buildings and cultivations went busily forward. Captain Wright was by no means hopeful. He considered that very*- little of the land was rich enough for agriculture, while it was too scrubby for the depasturing of sheep, the grass)' patches being of no great extent. But before reporting, he sent Hovell out on an extended exploration. That gentleman had, with abundant confidence, guided the expedition to Western Port as being the fine and promising 'sheet of water he had recently visited with Hume, but, on seeing it, he was compelled to acknowledge himself in error, and was in the somewhat humiliating position of being a discredited guide. He seems to have been anxious to regain the confidence which had been thus impaired, and undertook two laborious journeys in search of better land. An eight days' trip towards Wilson's Promontory. was without result, beyond the discovery of a seam of coal near Cape Patterson. In a second trip of twelve days, he attempted to force his way round to Port Phillip, but, what with impenetrable brush in one direction, and successions of marshes and rotten ground in others, his progress was only slight for the time employed. However, he reported his having seen Port Phillip ; the shores of this bay were reached in all probability between Frankston and Mordialloc ; and then Hovell seems to have followed the beach for a day or so till he reached the neighbourhood of the site of Brighton. But in such a course, he is not likely to have seen an)- land that would at first sight give any suggestion of fertility; nor would he see any more prepossessing as he held his way back along the ridge of the low ranges that traverse the peninsula, between Port Phillip and Western Port, in order to reach the boat that was to take him across to the settlement. He reported in favourable terms of what he had seen, but considered that he had found no place superior to that whereon the settlement was being formed. There he considered that the only drawback* was the shallow approach for vessels, but he thought that a jetty 800 feet long would fully remedy that defect, and he wound up his official communication to the Governor with a glowing account of the shores of Western Port, in which he states that \" the land appears fit for every kind of cultivation.\" But Captain Wright entertained an opinion wholly inconsistent with this. He reported that there was only a very small quantity of good land, and that the \"sterile, swampy, and impenetrable nature of the country surrounding Western Port\" induced him to believe that it was unsuitable for colonization. Indeed, the captain was so little impressed with the prospects of the place that he resigned his connection with it, considering his \"continuance at the scttle- Vol. I. K"], [92, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 72 ment altogether unnecessary.\" He therefore delivered up the care of the settlement to Lieutenant Burchell, the next in command, and returned to the metropolitan joys of Sydney. Governor Darling, reporting to the Colonial Office in London, forwarded a copy os Hovell's letter, with a slighting remark as to the value of the information it contained, and speaking in discouraging terms as to the prospects of the settlement. The Colonial Office seems to have been divided in opinion as to the policy to be adopted. Some of the officials thought that its situation in Bass's Strait was of first-rate importance from a strategical point of view. Others took* up the position that it was useless, and that as it could not be self-supporting, every necessary would have to be carried round from Sydney at great expense to the British Government. Eventually the matter was left entirely at the discretion of Darling, who, in consequence, notified his intention of abandoning the place about a year after it had been formed. He considered that the original intention of the settlement was accomplished, for the French vessels had left Australian seas, and it had become clear that there had been no intention of forming any French colonies on these shores. In January, 1828, the Isabella sailed from Sydney to remove the settlement, and the work of embarkation was speedily and quickly effected; the live stock was carried in a second vessel across the Straits to Port Dalrymple; while the Isabella stood down the port with the settlers on board, bidding farewell to the sandy shores, the wooded ridges, the broad and sunny expanses of Western Port. Thus were the shores of Victoria once more abandoned of civilized men, and the little township, with its fist}* houses, stood silent and tenantlcss, while the roofs decayed and fell in, the floors mouldered, and the cultivated plots grew thick with saplings. Many years afterwards the foundations of some, and the walls of others, were seen standing in ruins; the verandah posts of the commandant's house, and the stump of the flagstaff, still marked the scene of this half-hearted effort at colonization. And yet there were men of a wholly different way of thinking anxious to embark their private fortunes in that ver}- spot which these official-directed settlers abandoned so readily. Hume's report, which had appeared in the Sydney papers, had given to several of the free settlers of Tasmania the hope that over on the southern shores of the mainland there would be found sheep-country superior to any that had yet been seen in Australia. Hume was an experienced sheep-farmer, and so were his brothers and his father; and that he spoke with so free and unqualified an enthusiasm of the \" Iramoo Downs,\" lying round the bay of \"Jillong,\" was a guarantee that could not be excelled. In January, 1827, just after the expedition had reached Western Port, Mr. G. T. Gellibrand and Mr. John Batman sent from Launccston an application to be allowed to join in the new settlement. They proposed to send over from Tasmania about 1500 sheep, together with cattle and horses; Batman himself desired to reside permanently at Western Port, while Gellibrand proposed only to embark his money as a partner in the enterprise. This application was sent to Sydney and received by Governor Darling, who declined at that period to make any grant of land for the purpose, and, in his reply, vaguely hinted at the possibility of the early removal of the settlement. A gentleman named Smith, of Hobart, and several others, made applications of the same nature, but had no success, as neither the Governor nor the Colonial Office had any definite idea us making the south coast the scene of voluntary settlement; their intention had been at best to hold the land against foreign intruders by means of penal stations, and it was sold)- by its suitability for that purpose that Western Port was judged and condemned by Darling. Mis adverse opinion was, however, of manifest advantage to"], [93, "THE EXPLORATION OF VICTORIA. 73 the country. A second time Victorian soil was abandoned by the convict-gang, and the overseer and the whipping triangle, by the somewhat sorry crowd which too often formed the military guard in such outlying stations, and by all the obstacles to progress presented by the reign of officialism. It was to lie unappropriated for yet another seven or eight years, ere the free settler, ignoring officials and military escorts, was to make his independent home in the midst of its grassy parks. But in that interval there was some additional enthusiasm kindled in the minds of the would-be settlers by the work of the heroic explorer, Captain Sturt. Until the year 1S29 it was unknown whether Australia possessed an)* great rivers ; it was unknown even if the great regions to the west of the Blue Mountains possessed perennial streams. Oxley had followed two of the most promising from their sources away to the west, and found, so far as he could discern, that they terminated in marshes, where they seemed to be lost in evaporation. Sturt himself, accompanied by Hume, had followed up the Macquarie \u2014 a dwindling stream with a scarce perceptible current \u2014 and found it abruptly end with no apparent outlet. He had discovered the bed of a river he had called the Darling, but it was dry \u2014 a mere sandy trough with only the marks of a running stream, except that, at intervals of miles, a pond or two of saline and undrinkable water occupied the bottom of the hollow. The idea of interior Australia began to be that of a great riverless desert \u2014 not without grass, not destitute of timber, yet for ever uninhabitable, as being without stream or lake or reliable water. Sturt's famous second voyage proved that, along the northern border of what is now Victoria, there flowed a long, full-volumed river, entitled to a fairly respectable place among the streams of the world, and that this river was navigable for craft of a suitable description. He gave to the fine current he traced to the sea the name of Murray, in compliment to the permanent head of the Colonial Office, he being then unaware that he was merely on the lowcr portion of that stream to which, near its source, Hume had given his father's name. The discovery that this great river and its many perennial tributaries watered the district north of Port Phillip assuredly assisted in fixing on that district the attention of the sheep-farmers of Tasmania, and six years later brought over both Gellibrand and Batman without official permission. Captain Sturt was an officer of the military force at Sydney, but, after the death of Oxley, the Surveyor-General, he had been asked by Governor Darling to take on himself the toilsome and dangerous task of continuing the exploration of New South Wales. Accordingly, in 1828 and 1829, along with Hamilton Hume, he penetrated further to the west than any. white man had previously done, and discovered the Darling River; but the report he had to make was discouraging. The Governor was grievously disappointed to find that those streams which set out from the Blue Mountains, so promising to view, were all eventually spent or dried up when they had flowed far enough into the scorching plains of the west. But he had faith in the Murrumbidgee; the head waters of that stream had been known for some years, and they seemed to hold out the hopes of permanence and utility. Sturt was directed in his second trip to follow this stream and determine its fate.' In November, 1829, he found himself at early dawn leading his horse through the gates of the barracks, speculating on all that might happen ere he should again re-enter them, but light of heart and proud of the noble mission entrusted to his zeal and care. He called at the house of Mr. M'Lcay, the Colonial Secretary, whose son, George M'Lcay, had 1 The authority for the following narrative is the second volume of Sturt's \"Expeditions in Australia,\" second edition, London 1S34."], [94, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 74 volunteered to go as his companion. Sturt had asked Hume to go with him a second time, but had met with a refusal, Hume having his harvest close at hand, and being too poor to pass his time without earning a living. The drays were loaded; the pack-horses equipped; and forth the expedition sallied through the turnpike on their memorable trip, Harris and Hopkinson leading the way, Eraser stalking after with gun on shoulder; then the vehicles, one of which was loaded with a whaleboat, taken to pieces, but read)' to be fitted together. Then came the pack-horses, with their attendant, and Clayton, the carpenter; and riding in the rear came Sturt and M'Leay. Through the settled districts their progress was pleasant, \u2014 through Yass and on to the Murrumbidgee, whose bold and romantic scenery left a vivid impress upon the diary of the explorer; a rapid current some eighty feet wide, eddying in dark whirls towards the middle, but on its rock)- banks foaming and fretting and gurgling against the boulders that here and there skirted them. The hills in picturesque curves, all waving with continuous forests, hemmed them in so closely as to make their progress with the drays a matter of some difficulty; and they had to force their way through a wild pass, to leave the river, and strike it again further down upon its course. How wildly grand seemed those successions of luxuriantly timbered ranges, and the deep, gloom)', solitary gullies that lay between ! But the travelling was laborious, and twice had the foaming stream to be crossed where it expanded into broad fretful rapids that could be forded ; and so toiling along by day, pitching their camp by night round a cheerful fire, smoking a meditative pipe for an hour, and then gladly stretching out their weary limbs, they struggled on from day to day, out upon the plains, where their cattle and their drays found easier passage; but the stream was still too much a mountain torrent to afford any hope of navigating it. On they went, past stony rapids and deep pools, and long quiet reaches overhung by arches of meeting gum trees. But day by da)' the stream grew calmer and deeper, and its breadth stretched out to 200 feet or more; the country on cither side being open grassy plains, dotted with clumps of sombre-tinted trees. A few black tribes were met with of no very engaging aspect, but they made themselves agreeable, and acted as guides in cutting off some of the interminable windings of the stream."], [95, "THE EXPLORATION OF VICTORIA. 75 After some time they found themselves on a great plain\u2014 dry, bare, and barren, with not a blade of grass nor a tree, nor a shrub; with no beast or bird or living thing that the traveller could descry. A hot wind blew, and brought, both day and night, interminable clouds of sand and dust to make the hours seem ages. To shorten their path across these dreary spaces, they left the river banks for a time, and then entered upon beds of high reeds\u2014 hot, dusty, monotonous; and when they sought the stream again, failed to find it. They camped that night in much distress. Sturt slept not a minute; he was nervously alarmed that the morrow would make all his labour of little use by showing that this fair promising stream also, like all the rest, was lost, and yielded no outlet to the sea. They found the stream again, but on cither bank the reed beds were too formidable to be traversed with drays. It was necessary, therefore, to send them back and take to the river. In four days the whaleboat was put together and painted, while a smaller boat in about a week was built by the carpenter to assist in carrying stores. On 6th January, 1830, the boats were loaded, and next day, at dawn, Sturt, M'Leay, and a crew of six men pushed out on the current, leaving the remainder of the party to travel back with the horses and drays and the balance of the supplies. All day they sped lightly along with rows of mournful-looking reeds standing on cither hand and blocking all the view, and at night they landed, squeezing their tents in among these beds of reeds with some difficulty. On the second da)', their smaller boat struck heavily, and instantly went down in twelve sect of water. They pulled it out, but some time was lost in recovering the necessary articles it had contained. Then on they went for days, with a broadening current beneath, but a terrible heat above, and little to sec but the waving reeds on cither hand. At length, this dreary course began to improve ; park-like lands, with grassy flats, from which came fine streams both right and left; and the gum-trees that lined the river banks grew higher and leafier, till they almost over-arched, and made of the current a shady avenue, down which the boats drifted pleasantly. After a time the current quickened ominously, and they were hurried into a tangle of fallen logs, and, for half a day, the utmost skill was needed to save them from destruction as they shot over or between the foam-covered logs, between high and gloomy banks. The men were momentarily expecting some adventure, and it came; but it was a pleasant one. Without warning, the rapid current shot them out on the broad and placid surface of a greater river. It was from 400 to 500 feet broad, and of noble volume; and, for the rest of their journey, they encountered no difficulties of navigation. They were on the Murray, and, with sail and oar, they dropped down its glassy reaches day after day, with no adventures save those arising from the natives. The tribes along the shore of this fine river were much more numerous than any that Sturt had anywhere seen. He speaks, at times, of gatherings amounting to several hundreds, and they might have been dangerous if mischievous. But they were firmly managed by Sturt and humoured by the facetious M'Leay, who had no fear of them, and tickled their childish sense of fun by his whimsical ways. On one or two occasions the voyagers were anxious, but there was no serious trouble; nothing more disagreeable than a somewhat rude degree of curiosity, arising from the desire of the savages to understand all about the anatomy and constitutions of the marvellous intruders. But, on the whole, the natives were of service; one after another the tribes took the expedition under their care, trotting patiently along the banks all day, and setting up their frail habitations close by the tents at night. And when a tribe had reached the limits of"], [96, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 76 its territory, it sent a few youths forward to warn the next tribe, and secure for the visitors a favourable welcome. Thus, by reason of a firm nerve, a kind judiciousness, a resolution not to be easily offended, or readily provoked to display the superior powers of civilization (a temptation often too strong for the commoner class of explorers), Sturt was able, at the close of his voyage, to report that not a drop of human blood had marked the progress of the expedition. After a time they passed the mouth of a tributary, which Sturt rightly judged to be the Darling ; they examined it a little way up, but returned to follow the main stream. The month of January, 1830, was spent in moving on from day to day, and camping on the river. The banks became high and interesting; for a time they seemed like long rows of lofty pillars, but afterwards presented the appearance of a great bed of human skulls, which, on examination, proved to be the shells of molluscs, bleached to a dazzling whiteness. Further on, the river seemed to flow through a pleasant glen of half-a-mile in width, grassy, and lightly timbered, and bounded on either side by the cliffs of sand and oyster shells that formed the flood-banks of the stream. Again the high cliffs approached the stream, which grew broader. It dashed its waves against the foot of precipitous banks, towering far up to where the overlooking natives seemed small as crows ; but these lofty heights rarely met the current on both sides; there was a pleasant glen, grassy, thinly tim bered, with pools, and occasional reed-beds; bounded on cithcr hand by the cliffs, and within this verdant enclosure winding from one side to the other, the river found its devious way. They had now been nearly a month upon its current. They began to anxiously reckon over their provisions and the rations that would be necessary to take them back. It was, therefore, no small delight to them to understand from the natives that the sea lay not far in front, and soon after a few sea-gulls crossed overhead, suggesting sanguine thoughts. The river was a third of a mile wide; and afforded noble prospects in its constantly varying bends. Suddenly they came in sight of a wide sheet of water\u2014 a broad shallow lake\u2014 to which Sturt gave the name of Lake Alexandrina. They sailed out on it and steered for the opposite side, but the wind blew strong, the waves were running high, they had to return and encamp till the weather should moderate. But next day they had a delicious run across the lake with a fresh breeze that silled their sail, and sent them onward at four or five knots an hour. On the western side they landed, and the scenery on the Mount Lofty Ranges, and the flats around them, appeared singularly lovely to the eyes of the voyagers; as indeed it still docs to the traveller who has"], [97, "THE EXPLORATION OF VICTORIA. 77 journeyed over the long levels of the Wimmera, and the dreary monotony that lies beyond them over the South Australian border, and then crossing Lake Alexandrina, refreshes his eyes with the sight of pleasant hills \u2014 green with constant showers and floating mists \u2014 around the pretty township of Strathalbyn. It was certainly not less charming to these first observers, who had been so many weeks passing through the unbroken plains. But the result of the expedition was disappointing. They searched for a day or two in vain to find the outlet from the lake to the sea, camping by night on the sand-hills with the lake behind, and before them the roar of the long breakers, which rolled on the beaches of Encounter Bay. Sturt would gladly have passed out upon the open sea and steered his course for Launceston, but it was impossible to force the boat over the shallows and mud flats that obstructed the only channel they could find. It was, therefore, necessary to turn back and row homeward along the stream by which they had descended. But they had already been nearly forty days from the place where they had embarked, and the provisions they still had would not supply them for an equal length of time, while it was scarcely likely that they would return up-stream as rapidly as they had dropped down. It was therefore with some considerable anxiety as to the result that they re-entered the river, and commenced their weary pull for home, Sturt and M'Leay taking their turn at these long, straight, clumsy oars along with the others. Very long and toilsome seemed those days; very short the succeeding nights, and all too scanty of repose, seeing that the natives troubled them more in their return than in their going, and watches had to be set and relieved throughout the night, and men had to patrol, who were utterly wearied with the labour of the day. At length, after many adventures, on the seventy-seventh day from their departure, they landed on the banks of the Murrumbidgee at the spot where they had embarked. Again a miserable disappointment; there was no one there to meet them as they had fondly hoped ; and they had now the prospect of striving to row with almost exhausted provisions up the strong and foaming head waters of a rapid stream. Seventeen days they toiled, with little progress. One of the men lost his senses. They abandoned the notion of sailing back on that swift current, and sent two of the men who were least reduced by privations and labours for help if they could find their way by land to the nearest inhabited station, seventy miles away, while the rest, on meagre rations, waited the return of drays to carry back themselves and their property. After waiting eight days, and consuming absolutely their last ounce of food, they buried all their belongings, and were beginning to drag their emaciated bodies along the track of their comrades, when the appearance of succour turned the bitterness of desperation into a sweet renewal of life; and the remainder of their journey was only the careful and, on the whole, comfortable transference of the invalids to the settled districts. Sturt eventually lost his sight, as a consequence of the trials he had undergone. Ninety- four days passed in a whaleboat beneath a blazing sun, and amid toils, privations, and anxieties, had left indelible traces. Three years later, when, in London, he was compiling those two volumes which contain the interesting narrative of his voyage, he sat in almost complete darkness, and was indebted to the kindness of friends for all the writing that had to be done. But he had rendered a vast service to the history of Victoria, and there is no name more honoured in the story of Australian exploration. In regard to the immediate interests of Victoria, he had traced her northern boundary, where it is defined by the River Murray, for a distance of over two hundred miles. He had shown the world that there, in these southern parts of"], [98, "78 VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. Australia, lay fine rivers, grassy plains, rich agricultural lands; and the appearance of his volumes awakened interest in the district, rekindled the zeal of Batman, and helped to send across to Port Phillip, a couple of years later, that band of settlers who were destined to make it a colony. He himself, however, was in his later life much more identified with our sister colony of South Australia, which also in a great measure owed its foundation round the lower course of the Murray to the appearance of Sturt's volumes just at the time when Wakefield was reaching success in his colonising projects. Sturt threw in his lot with the people of Adelaide, and by his advice and knowledge of Australia was of the utmost assistance to the early colonists. He became their Surveyor-General, and in that capacity, though in wretched health, conducted the famous exploring expedition which reached, or almost reached, the centre of Australia, and spent a season there amid the most formidable dangers and hardships. In 1849 he was the Colonial Secretary of South Australia, and on relinquishing that post he retired with a pension of .\u00a3600 a year, and public thanks as having been the early benefactor of the colony. He spent the long evening of his life at Cheltenham, in England, most of it in utter darkness. He stands in the front rank of the world's explorers, and is well worthy to be a national hero; \u2014 a modest, simple-hearted gentleman, kind yet firm, brave yet gentle, regardless of his own toils, yet ever considerate of others \u2014 his private character is as worthy to attract our affectionate esteem as his public services to command our admiration. To us in Victoria who have inherited some of the fruits of his labours and sacrifices, it ought to be with grateful remembrance that we recall the calm and dignified features of Captain Charles Sturt.

Ube lpovtlanb :Ba\\> Settlement T^M \u00a7J\u00a3*%\\ y^- first permanent homestead erected on Victorian soil overlooked the sunny ISfi*d P^ill i expanse of Portland Bav. It was there that Edward, Stephen, Frank, and John .Ma^i W3PA ' Hentv settled, to build up their fortunes on the promising shores of new lands. Psllj' |&|\u00bb| Their father, Thumas Henty, was a worthy gentleman of the South of England, \u25a0 - - ' a farmer of considerable means and good education, and well known through all England as one of the most successful breeders of high-class stock. Though sixty years of age, he had enough of fire in him to be moved by the reports that in the year 1828 were common in the newspapers as to the fertility of Western Australia, and the astonishing prospects held out by the new colony then recently formed at Swan River. The old gentleman had seven sons around him, the youngest seventeen years of age, who found some trouble in securing openings for themselves in the crowded community of the old country. It was on their behalf that the stout hearted old farmer proposed, in his declining years, to give up his comforts and become a colonist. He expended ten thousand pounds in chartering a barque named the Caroline, and freighting her with farm implements, ten draught horses, ten choice cattle, one hundred and eight}* pure merino sheep (then a great rarity in England), and in addition all that could be wanted in the way of stores and seeds. In charge of this first instalment he sent three of his sons, with about thirty farm labourers, hoping that in the fertile province of Swan River the soil would at once be broken, and ere a few months had passed the golden crops would be waving over gladsome acres of land. But alas the reality! In spite of the glorious predictions of Captain Stirling and Mr. Vol. I. L"], [100, "80 VICTORIA AND ITS METRO POLLS: PAST AND PRESENT. Fraser, there was no agricultural land to be seen, and the Swan River district was a hopeless disappointment. The three brothers unloaded their stock, dismissed their vessel, and proceeded to explore the country. For two whole years they examined it with painful care, but found no place that promised them any success for their intended operations. Time after time they returned to their temporary quarters, half-starved and emaciated with the privations of the bush, but without any hopeful news to tell. And each time they returned they found their precious stock disappearing; that little herd, that choice flock preserved with so much labour through a seven-months' voyage to be the foundation of their future operations was rapidly being destroyed by want of feed and by the ravages of a poisonous herb that was prevalent among the native grasses. The three brothers agreed that a further stay would mean a complete collapse, and, in 1 83 1, they sailed for Tasmania, having previously informed their father of their intention. The old gentleman was not induced to abandon his notion of emigrating. On the contrary, he chartered a second vessel, the Forth of Alloivay, loaded it with more sheep and cattle and horses, and set sail with his wife, his daughter, and his three remaining sons, together with twenty farm servants. But as he held a land order for 80,000 acres in Western Australia, he thought it wise to call there on his way and look after his interests in person. He formed an impression quite as unfavourable as that of his sons ; and, almost immediately after, he continued his voyage round the southern coasts of Australia on his way to Launceston.' On its way towards Bass's Straits the vessel put into Portland Bay, and the old farmer was pleased with the look of the pretty inlet. The soil seemed good, and he marked the place in his mind as one not to be forgotten. It was, at this time, not wholly unoccupied; for the sealing captains had found it to be a useful centre for some of their operations, and were in the habit of leaving men occasionally to live on shore, and gather sealskins. In this manner William Dutton had lived there for two months in the year 1828, and found the place so pleasant, and the work so profitable, that in the following year he had returned and built himself a hut, where he remained sealing for many months. In 1832 he had built himself a comfortable cabin, with a pleasant garden round it, and had established a station for whaling, for which the surrounding waters seemed peculiarly adapted. It was in this manner that the southern shores both of Victoria and of South Australia were occupied by men unknown to even local fame; some of them indeed by no means anxious to be known, lest the manner of their lives should happen to come within the notice of the law, which might not have taken an altogether indulgent view of it. The sailors were landed on islands close to the coast, or sometimes on the coast itself, and were supplied \u2014 generally once a year \u2014 with flour, tea, sugar, tobacco, and some slop-made clothing; and they lived a life of careless freedom, generally two together, in a hut, or even a neat little cottage, surrounded by a garden that supplied them with potatoes, onions, barley, sometimes a little wheat; they had their little herds of goats, or even a pig or two, or perhaps a few fowls ; they stole a woman a-piece, or sometimes two or three each, from the natives on the mainland, and often found these poor creatures devotedly attached to them after a few months of residence in their homes; for it was quite the prevailing fashion among the blacks themselves to steal their wives, and a woman did 1 The authorities for this portion of Victorian history are the volume entitled \" Australians, \" published by Mr. Richmond Henty in 1886, and Mr. Labilliere's \" Early History of Victoria,\" wherein, at the beginning of the second volume, there is printed quite a mass of documents relating to the settlement of Portland Bay; also a small brochure published in 1872 by Edward Henty; and Gurner's \"Chronicle of Port Phillip.\""], [101, "THE PORTLAND BA Y SETTLEMENT. 81 not resent the indignity so much as we, whose ideas of women are so much higher, might possibly imagine they would. They imitated their Sabine prototypes of Rome, and after a short sulky fit grew contented with the kinder ways and better fare of a sealer's home. They attended to the wallaby snares and the fishing lines, or even could pull an oar when occasion required. So there lived the sealer, a monarch in his way, and an Oriental monarch in the matter of wives. He needed no money, except a sovereign or two to make into earrings for his dusky brides. He manned his boat with the same brides once a year, and sailed for Nepean Bay, or whatever might be his particular rendezvous. There he delivered up the sealskins and the furs of wallaby and opossums, which he had gathered in the twelve months just passed by, and in exchange received some tea, tobacco, and a little grog with which to live a life of plenty in the coming year. Some of these men made for themselves good houses of stone, and most of them liked the life they led so well as to make no effort to return to their native lands. A few took cash for their skins and furs, and having gathered together a competency, bequeathed their wives to some worthy shipmate, and revisiting the lanes of Portsmouth or of Plymouth, settled down to patriarchal lives at home, discreetly silent no doubt as to the charms of a sealer's life abroad.\" These were the first white settlers of Victoria, but their advent was in no way the foundation of our colony. They dwelt upon the fringes of the land, but they did not occupy it, far less did they colonize it. Several men of that class had inhabited Portland Bay, but Mr. Dutton was of a superior character. He had once been mate of a vessel, and lived an honourable life at Portland Bay in the more arduous pursuits of whaling. Mr. Henty seems to have taken note of the whaling, the sealing, and the pasture lands of Portland Bay, and even then made up his mind to occupy the country at some suture date. But, in the meantime, he proceeded to Launceston, where he purchased a property on the banks of the Tamar. He tried to get some allowance made for the grant of land in Western Australia, which was of no use to him; but the authorities could not be induced to give any free grant in Tasmania. In that colony three of the sons settled. James began business as a merchant in Launceston; William, who came out from England by himself, became a solicitor at Hobart; while Charles entered the Bank of Australasia. Edward was sent by his father with the schooner Elizabeth to take a more careful look at Portland Bay, and to examine, also, the coasts in the neighbourhood, in order to discover some suitable place where the three youngest sons might form a home for themselves. In 1833 the Elizabeth anchored comfortably in Portland Bay, and Edward Henty explored the land for some miles inland. He seems to have been pleased with what he saw, for although he subsequently visited King's Island, Kangaroo Island, and Spencer's Gulf, he reported, on his return to Launceston, that Portland Bay was the most suitable situation for their proposed settlement. Accordingly, towards the end of the following year, he sailed from Launceston in the Thistle with five servants and a small quantity of stock; he landed at Portland Bay on 19th November, 1834, and erected tents for himself and men. The stock were landed safely, and the busy days began\u2014 up at dawn, toiling through the long day, and to rest when night closed in on these silent shores. The land was one great forest, generally open enough to permit of the growth of good grass underneath, but in places it presented dense masses of thickly-tangled scrub, through which it was difficult to pass if they wished to sec what the country looked like round those woody !

Before them the long sweep of sand and rocks ran out to the bold headland of Cape Grant on the left, and far away to the left an unbroken stretch to where the Lady Julia Percy islet reared its rocky head. The bay was beautifully blue, and its waters so clear, that from the shore it was possible to watch a school of whales come in, six or eight at a time, and to see the great black masses under water as they rubbed themselves on the sands to rid themselves of the There, in that scene of sylvan beauty, varied by all the charms of a summer-dreaming shore, the settlers raised their house, their sheds, and barns ; they sank their well into the turf-covered earth ; they broke up the soil, and made a hurried planting of vegetables, vines and fruit trees, ploughing being commenced on the 6th of December; and there, in the course of a month Frank Henty joined them with more stock and additional ser vants. EDWARD HENTY. At this time Stephen Henty was at Swan River, whither he had gone to finally wind up the family affairs in that colony, probably with a forlorn hope of possibly selling for a small sum the land order for 80,000 acres of \"sand and granite covered with grass-tree and xamia, and gigantic timber.\" But he not only wound up the family affairs, but also concluded a small affair of his own, being married to the daughter of a naval commandant before he sailed from Swan River. The vessel which he had chartered for himself called in at King George's Sound, where the captain was drowned, and he, though by no means conversant with navigation, was obliged to take command himself, and, with the assistance of the seamen, prosecute the voyage. The consequence was that they mistook Cape Otway for Cape Northumberland, and ran up into Port Phillip under the impression that they were at Portland Bay. But the place in no way answered to the description ; they turned and sailed out ; and, after some adventures, anchored in front of the grey weatherboard cottages of their brothers, where the three green paddocks of already cleared ground, well fenced and sown, ran down to the beach and the low cliffs that fringed the shores. It was in the month of December, 1836, that he brought his bride to her new home, and there, in August of the following year, was born Richmond Henty, the first white person born in the Western District of Victoria and the second born in the colony, being two months younger than another born in the then rising settlement at Port Phillip. In the meantime John Henty had brought over a new accession of stock from Launceston, so that now there were four brothers in the settlement, and about thirty persons in their employment. The miniature colony was thus growing in size, and yet they were all located on country to which they had no legal right. In the eyes of the law, the)- were merely trespassers. In their own they were pioneers in a worthy movement, and deserving of credit for their enterprise; but to the Colonial Office in"], [103, "THE PORTLAND BAY SETTLEMENT. 83 London they presented the aspect of provoking people, who would insist on settling beyond the recognised limits of settlement. Hence arose a dispute, which has always been the cherished grievance of the Henty family; a contest in which there was a great deal to be said on both sides; a quarrel in which the authorities of the time were perfectly in the right from their point of view, seeing that no possible spirit of prophecy could guide them as to the course which events were shortly to take; though we, looking back on our pioneers with some little satisfaction, and with half a century of experience to guide us, may perhaps wish that the founders of Portland had met with encouragement, and been dealt with in a generous rather than in a legal spirit by the colonial authorities of the day. The policy of the Colonial Office, which led to the discouragements shown to the Henty family, was founded originally on the views of Governor Bourke, who, in a despatch dated 1834, complained of the expensive character of the government he had to administer. Over that vast area then included in New South Wales there were scattered only the population of a third-rate English city, and the means of protection and justice had to be provided for widely detached townships of only a few houses each. But outside even of these thinly peopled districts, the wool-growers were accustomed to gather together their flocks and their shepherds, and to sally forth upon the great wilderness, where they fixed their abodes a hundred miles beyond the limits of ordinary settlement. Now, said Bourke, it would be unwise to throw any obstacle in the way of these people. Let them go forth and enrich the colony by converting the untouched grasses of lonely plains into wool for export. But by no means give them any sort of official recognition. If they go forth and settle, determined to protect themselves and manage their own affairs, they arc useful colonists. But, if the State gives them any official recognition, it will justify them in their claim for police and magistrates, and roads and posts, and so forth, and at such distances, with so thin a population, these \"squatters\" would be nothing but a drag on the colony; they would abstract from the public purse far more than they could ever contribute. Therefore, when Thomas Henty applied to the Right Hon. E. G. Stanley for permission to settle at Portland Bay, his application was met in the way suggested by Bourke's advice. No difficulties would be thrown in the way, but no legal rights would be granted. Henty proposed to abandon his land order for 84,000 acres at Swan River, and requested that in exchange he should be allowed to select 20,000 acres of waste land at Portland Bay, for which he would pay at the rate of five shillings per acre; and, as the first settler in the district, he undertook to see that the natives were treated with humanity and consideration. This proposal seems moderate enough, yet the English Government would give it no countenance ; not that they objected to the settlement of the family at Portland Bay, but that the selling or leasing of land, or any formal transaction in reference to it, would commit them to responsibilities which, at so great a distance from both Sydney and Hobart, would prove vexatious and expensive. Mr. Henty sent his eldest son James to London to add the influence of a personal interview, but nothing could alter the decision of the authorities. Colonel Arthur, who was the Governor in Tasmania, sympathised with the troubles of the old gentleman, who, after having expended a fortune in an emigration enterprise, as bold and spirited as any the colonies had yet seen, now found himself in poorer circumstances than if he had stayed at home. The Governor supported the application by writing that \" Mr. Henty and his family are highly"], [104, "84 VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. respectable, and deserve, so far as it can consistently be given, the support of the Government.\" Mr. James Henty presented several memorials, in which he showed that it was through reliance on the reports of government officers that his father had been induced, at so great an expense, to emigrate to Western Australia, which was found to answer so badly to the descriptions given of it. He pled that his father might be allowed to purchase, at a reasonable price, one-fourth as much good land in Portland Bay as he was authorised to select of bad land at Swan River. But the only answer was a cold reply that in all this the authorities did not see any grounds for altering their decision. Earl Surrey then took up the cause of his former Sussex neighbour, and wrote a personal appeal to the new Colonial Secretary, the Earl of Aberdeen, stating that the Henty family were bent on settling in Portland Bay, and that the)- had chartered a vessel in Tasmania to carry stock and implements across to that locality ; they wished no Government protection, they were prepared to protect themselves, but they would like a guarantee of priority of claim, lest, when the place came in after years to be settled in a regular way, the fruits of all their toil should be sold to others as being upon soil to which they had no legal right. The Earl of Aberdeen replied that such a guarantee was quite inconsistent with the policy of his department, which was to concentrate the settlers, as far as possible, not to encourage small bands to isolate themselves five hundred miles from the nearest settlement. But he admitted that if the place should subsequently be acknowledged as a settlement, and land should be sold there by the Government, it was not unlikely that an)' area under cultivation, or duly surrounded by a substantial fence, would be dealt with in a manner favourable to the claims of the family. At the same time he committed the Colonial Office to nothing, and left the matter in a state most unsatisfactory to the settlers. Old Mr. Henty was then residing at Launceston, waiting till some definite settlement of his claims should be arrived at, ere he should cross himself with the rest of his stock and property ; but, meantime, the seasons were stealing on, he was nearing his seventieth year, when a sudden quinsy carried him off from the scene of his busy speculations. His wife removed to Hobart, and left the prosecution of the family plans to her band of active sons. The four who had made their homes at Portland Bay were not daunted by the insecurity of their position. They laboured hard, and in a few years had formed a valuable property though not for themselves; for in subsequent years the Government made them pay for it all at the enhanced value given to it by their own labours, and the only concession given to them was the remission of \u00a31738 of the purchase money; that, too, when they were paying ;\u00a3ioo an acre for land as town land where they themselves had made the town by their own unaided exertions. In 1840 they had formed six sheep stations, three along the coast, and three some sixty miles inland on the Merino Downs, where the Rivers Wannon and Glenelg water these grassy lands. The township of Portland then consisted of one large house of twelve rooms, the residence of Mr. Stephen Henty, and round it clustered six decent cottages, while a few huts, and sheds, with barns, and stores, stables, dairy, and other buildings, together with a blacksmith's and a carpenter's hut, made the place look thriving. So thriving indeed that in that year Governor Gipps sent round surveyors from Sydney, and had the place proclaimed a township. The land was put up to auction, and the allotments in the town secured an average price of \u00a3551 per acre, and others in the immediate vicinity were sold for \u00a364 an acre; while farmlands two miles out of the town brought the remarkable price of \u00a311 per acre \u2014 remarkable when"], [105, "THE PORTLAND BA Y SETTLEMENT. 85 it is remembered that there were then not a hundred people at Portland Bay, though the population on the six stations was supposed to amount to six hundred. The Sydney Government realised altogether over seventeen thousand pounds for 537 acres of land that five years previously had been absolutely waste and useless. At that rate certainly the Government officials were not likely to find the settlement a drag on the taxpayers of Sydney, and they could afford, therefore, with a good grace, to send a police magistrate, Mr. James Blair, to administer justice, and a surveyor, Mr. F. A. Powlett, to act as Commissioner of Crown Lands for the district. The Henty Brothers had to pay somewhat handsomely for their pioneer enterprise, and had the mortification to feel themselves regarded, for a long time, as downright annoyances to the authorities; but, in 1846, their troubles came to an end; they asked no further favours or consideration, but forgot that they were the pioneers; they settled down to take their place with the rest, and prospered with the prosperity of the community. Even so early as 1840 more than 1700 bales of wool (worth some \u00a330,000) were shipped from the little port, and generally three, four, or even five vessels could be seen at anchor off the grassy slopes of the town. After that date the progress of the place was constant and rapid. In the early days of the settlement the Henty Brothers had relied to a considerable extent on the capture of whales as an accession to their income. They had three look-out stations on prominent points of the coast, and several boats with necessary gear, ready at a signal to attack the spouting monsters, of which a dozen, or sometimes even twenty, were captured in a single season. When the boats put off to race each other for the honour and advantage of the first harpoon stroke, there was excitement in Portland ; when the great leviathan drifted ashore, and the cutting and preparing of the blubber began ; when the blacks assembled for a gorge on unlimited whale slices; then the township of Portland was an animated place, and, though it sunk back a day or two afterwards into its usual condition of sunny dreaminess, it left the cheering result behind of some hundreds of tons of oil, that sold at an excellent price. Sometimes the place did not contain barrels enough for the oil, and wells were dug and lined with clay to contain it for a time. Thus, with sheep and cattle and pigs, with whaling and sealing; with pleasant gardens and a little cultivation, Portland soon made itself known as a place of promise; and its dignity was assured when it took undoubted rank as the seaport of the splendid pastoral plains of Western Victoria. These plains were the discovery of that industrious explorer, Sir Thomas Mitchell. He was, at the time of his memorable expedition to Portland Bay, only Major Mitchell, a Scotchman who had served with distinction as an officer in the Peninsular War, but who, in the long peace that followed the battle of Waterloo, turned his scientific acquirements to account by accepting the position of Surveyor-General to the colony of New South Wales. He was a worthy successor to Oxley. After making an exquisite map of the Blue Mountains, he traced, in 1831 and 1832, the courses of some of the upper tributaries of the Darling; and, in 1835, very nearly completed the examination of the whole of the Darling itself. It was in 1835 that he started on that expedition which proclaimed to the world the charms of the district, which, in his somewhat fervid enthusiasm, he called Australia Felix. With twenty-three men, he started, on St. Patrick's Day, in 1835, to trace the course of the Darling, and to examine the country beyond the Murray. Settlement was spreading so rapidly that for many hundred miles out from Sydney his journey presented not the smallest difficulty. He had two carts with horses, and four drays with bullock teams; he had boats"], [106, "86 VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. mounted on boat carriages; he had a doctor, a plant collector, a bird collector, two carpenters, a shoemaker, a cook, two blacksmiths, six men to drive bullocks, and three to drive horses; so that it was no flying expedition, but quite a little force that followed the Major out into the wilds. The expenses of equipment amounted to nearly a thousand pounds. They followed the Lachlan without trouble to the Murrumbidgee. With equal ease, and guided by Sturt's map, they reached the Murray, along whose banks they marched till they met the Darling. Leaving there the main body of the expedition, Mitchell, with a few men, turned northward to trace the Darling up to the spot where he had recently desisted in his descent of that stream, but, finding the water diminish till the bed was practically dry, and having proved beyond a doubt the identity of what he had formerly seen with the course he was now on, he returned, leaving a gap of a hundred miles and more still unexplored. There seemed little use in descending a stream so carefully examined as the Murray had been by Captain Sturt, and Mitchell thought it better to strike, at some convenient spot, across country towards the sea. For that purpose he returned along the Murray to its junction with the Murrumbidgee, there crossed the main river, and, ascending on the southern bank for some distance further, reached a spot which he called Swan Hill. The country he had travelled through in previous years, along the Darling, had been bare, arid, and forbidding ; all the more graceful, therefore, did the freshness of this fine country appear in that winter season, with its grassy plains and full-flowing streams and picturesque clumps of handsome timber. Beyond Swan Hill he found a tributary of the Murray, which he took to be the Goulburn of Hume and Hovell, but in that he was mistaken.3 He followed the course of this stream towards its source, but, having ascended a hill, and observed the great beauty of the country lying back from the stream, he shaped his course for an elevation he had seen from the summit, and to which, from its shape, he gave the name of Pyramid Hill. Two days later he stood on the prominent block of granite which forms the apex of that hill, and looked over a scene such as he had hitherto nowhere seen in Australia. The plains were great expanses of fresh and luxuriant green, and in the light of a fine winter morning they formed a perfect pastoral paradise. He was deeply struck by this wide view over \" a land so inviting and still without inhabitants.\" But he felt the pride of being the \"harbinger of mighty changes;\" he had a presentiment of that impending settlement which so soon was to roll over these very wastes. He had given his party directions to cross the plains in a course to the south-east. There he could see it like a train of ants away in the distance penetrating the solitudes where now a dozen townships fringe the course of a railway. After a fourteen miles chase, he overtook them, and they all camped by the edge of a box-tree forest; for day after day the country he traversed was all of the same character; a great deal of it open plains, covered with rich crops of that oat-grass so valuable for either sheep or cattle; while running streams interrupted their march at every few miles, and delayed them by the labour necessary for crossing, and on the banks of those streams fine groves of pleasant trees gave variety to the landscape. From these plains they caught glimpses of peaks to the east of their route, and leaving the rest of the expedition to hold onward to the south-cast, he took- several men with him on a flying trip to these hills, whose highest point, Mount Barrabungale, he ascended; but when he stood upon its naked granite peaks a great whirling mass of rain-clouds swept round them, and utterly obscured his view; the :l The authority for this portion of Victorian history is the second volume of Mnjnr Mitchell's \"Three Expeditions into the Interior of Eastern Australia.\""], [107, "THE PORTLAND BAY SETTLEMENT. 87 only fruit of the trip being to reveal to Mitchell that the course his expedition was following led into the heart of hilly country, with ridges highly timbered, and valleys of open undulation, richly grassed, and each with its stream of foaming waters. He did not turn out of his course, and found these wooded ranges in no way difficult to cross, while he experienced an unmeasured satisfaction in the delicious little valleys he constantly crossed. It must be remembered, however, that it was winter, and after a season of plentiful rains, when Western Victoria assumes its most agreeable aspect, but Mitchell declared that under no circumstances had he seen in any part of the world so wide an extent of beautiful pastoral scenery. In his journal he breaks into raptures on the 8th of July, when he camped by a splendid stream flowing bank high through a level tract of grassy land. This stream he called the Loddon from a fancied resemblance to the old-world river of early recollection, and the name is still retained, though in truth he was only crossing the upper water of that stream which he had considered erroneously to be the Goulburn of Hume and Hovell. A day or two later he is again enraptured with his camping place. For, after crossing the Loddon and some low quartz hills, he descended into a charming scene; the turf, the woods, and the grassy banks of a murmuring stream that went rippling onward with strong eddies through the vale, gave him the impression of a richly-ornamental English park, so perfect seemed the disposition of all its elements. To this stream he gave the name of the Avoca, moved, doubtless, by the \" clearest of crystal and brightest of green\" which Tom Moore has so sweetly celebrated in the Irish Valley. Here the oat-grass waved in little seas, and on it were pasturing herds of kangaroos, which were easily added to their provision supplies. For days together he held on his way through scenery varied in its features, but everywhere fresh and inviting. Just before crossing another charming stream, which he called the Avon, he went to the top of a hill of moderate elevation, whence he could see, away to the south, the summit of a range both bold in outline and notable in height. To avoid the outlying spurs of these ranges he had to alter his course more to the west, and had the satisfaction of still finding nothing but the most charming of prospects. He had no drawback to his satisfaction, except that the grassy lands were too soft for his heavy drays and carts, and especially for the carriages which carried his boats. The wheels of these continually sank to the axles, and what with unharnessing the half-dozen horses and fifty bullocks, and gathering their united strength to pull the vehicles out of soft places, or up from the beds of boggy creeks; what with harnessing and then unharnessing a dozen times in a few hours, their progress was slow, and the cattle showed signs of over-fatigue. Mitchell, therefore, left them on the banks of a stream he called the Doscasas, and while they should have a few days of rest he utilised the time in a rapid trip to the lofty peaks he had seen towards the south. The distance was between thirty and forty miles, but Mitchell reckoned on being able to see the coast from one of the summits, and so to form an idea of his future course. They rode through lovely forest lands, well grassed, and so fully watered that they generally crossed four or five streams each day; and pleasant little lakes at every few miles were seen sleeping in silvery expanses, beyond the sombre glades of sheoak and blackbutt. The mountain that la)- before them was nearly five thousand five hundred feet high, and promised a climb of some little toil. At first it was steep, but woody, presenting no difficult)-, but only labour; but the summit was everywhere guarded by lines of rock rising with precipitous front to a hundred and fort)- feet; and the faces of these cliffs were icy, and the broken ledges slippery with thawing snow. They had much difficulty in ascending these heights, Vol. I. M"], [108, "88 VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. MOUN r ARAI'ILES, and when they reached the top their path led through frozen bushes, and bare boughs, from which the icicles depended. An unpleasant ascent brought them to the aged-looking boulder hung with icicles, that marked the top of this high peak, to which Mitchell gave the name of Mount William. And now, when they stand on the topmost pinnacle, hoping to see for scores of miles and map out far and wide this lovely land of their discover)-, the mist-racks curl up along the mountain-breast and no view is to be had but wide extents of sullen clouds beneath them. But Mitchell could not easily bring himself to throw away the result of all their toil ; he resolved to stay the night on the summit; and they went supperless to rest amid the wetting mists, and the sloppy half-thawed snow. It was a night of . misery to all ; their wretched fire of wet wood smoked and steamed, but refused to burn cheerily; while a cold wind whistled sharply over that exposed situation. As the night wore on, however, they could see the stars come out, and the)' hoped for a clear to-morrow. The morning slowly broke; as a faint greyness stole up out of the darkness Mitchell mounted his lichen-tinted rock ; the sun rose rapidly over a bank of red clouds, the vast masses of vapour rolled up, and he looked for the first time on that glorious prospect of Western Victoria. To the south and east vast plains of level lands, all grassy, but intersected by belts of open woodlands ; to the west and south-west long ridges of loft)' mountains, bold and picturesque in outline; to these he gave the names Victoria Range and Serra Range, calling the whole system of ranges the Grampians, with the ardour of a Scotchman far from home. But there was no view to be had of the sea, and indeed the prospect he saw proved of short duration, the tumbling masses of cloud-rack drifted up and enclosed the mountain-top; and the party had nothing left but to descend cold, hungry, and wet. An eight-mile walk brought them to their horses, where a good breakfast and a blazing fire beneath a wide-spread"], [109, "THE PORTLAND BAY SETTLEMENT. 89 sheoak took away the sense of immediate discomfort, but two of the men were invalids for some time after as the result of that chilly night. That fleeting prospect on the mountain top had revealed to Mitchell the vast extent of the fine land he was traversing, but it likewise admonished him to keep well to the west if he wished to reach the sea, for among these rocky ranges there could be no progress for such an expedition as his. With cattle refreshed, he turned due west over plains of stiff clay \u2014 all magnificently grassed \u2014 keeping the bold masses of the Grampians always well in sight to the south; they passed the Richardson River, and the Wimmera flowing in five deep currents, the crossing of which occupied a whole day. The stream was very pretty; here with banks of rounded green knolls, and there with a fringe of mimosa bushes nodding over its dark waters. Then on they went through woodland glades that offered charming landscapes; but after a time the plains grew less inviting, and they began to see straight in front of them an abrupt mass of jagged sandstone throwing its head up out of a level country, which was green enough, though monotonous. Mitchell climbed to the top of this bold escarpment, less than eight hundred feet high, but remarkable for the way in which it throws its sandstone cliffs up from the otherwise unbroken plains. He ascended by its sloping side through pines and she-oaks and pleasant ever-green shrubs, and, from its precipitous brow, looked out on a broad level of sunny, pastoral tranquillity. A wide plain of grass and sylvan expanses lay far as eye could range, and, dotting it with an exquisite charm, slept the mirror-like faces of seven-and-twenty lakes, all circular, all of silver glimmer, unbroken but for flocks of duck and swans in tremulous patches. To this singular height, Mitchell gave the name of Arapiles, for it reminded him of the pair of rugged peaks from whose summits Wellington and Marmont bombarded each other at the opening of the battle of Salamanca. Strange to say, it was on the anniversary of that victory that Mitchell climbed the Australian Arapiles, and he lived over again that July morning twenty-four years ago, when at dawn he was roused from his couch by the angry guns to take his place in line upon those plains of Salamanca, to be covered ere nightfall with twenty thousand dead and wounded. It was a vastly different scene over which these rugged heights impended on that pleasant morning, rich and promising; even though, on the outskirts of the view, the travellers afterwards came upon a patch of the mallee scrub \u2014 that barrier so long opposed to occupation. For a couple of days they traversed open forest tracts, well grassed and of favourable aspect, but every few miles intersected by lines of bare sandhills. The White Lake was seen and named, and then they descended on a grassy flat, whereon the winding lines of mimosa and drooping gum-trees marked the course of an important river. This was called by Mitchell the Glenelg, after the feeble Secretary for the Colonies of those times. For some time the cattle had been forced to drag the carts over soft grassy plains, into which the wheels sank deep. They were showing signs of fatigue, and, to put them once more in condition, Mitchell resolved to leave them for a time while he sailed down the river to the sea. So the boats were unshipped, and, bidding good-bye to their comrades, their crews dropped down a fine current with the most picturesque reaches; but, after only two miles, the width of the river contracted. The foliage stretched across the stream, and they had to cut their way through. A mile more was all the)- could finish in the rest of the day, and then the)- camped in the most exquisitely green and refreshing country. Next morning they pushed off into a clear reach that promised well, but in a short time terminated in a rocky fall. Hence, they had to go about and return to the camp. Again the whole party was"], [110, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS- PAST AND PRESENT. go put in motion, and again the crack of the bullock-driver's whip, and the loud objurgations of the drivers themselves, woke up the silent echoes, as the cattle strained every nerve to pull the carts through the deeply-rutted grass. Often a dray would prove to be completely stuck, and a couple of drivers had to be left in charge till the evening camp should be formed, and all the teams brought back to extricate the unlucky vehicle. On some of these occasions the drivers had anxious times, and when they were relieved they were found sitting with carbines loaded and cart ridges laid out in rows in front of them, while a score or two of prowling forms could be seen indistinctly in the foliage wrapped in grey twilight. ON NIGHT GUARD. But all the land the)- passed through looked like a squatter's paradise \u2014 the unbroken sward, the timber dotted in ornamental clumps, the hills all grassy to their rounded tops \u2014 and when after a week of travelling the)- came upon a second river, and looked down into the valley where two charming rivers met, Mitchell's enthusiasm culminated. On that bright August morning the scent of hay seemed to waft up out of the luxurious hollow, and he felt proud with the pride of having added to the domains of man a region ready at once to receive him and make him rich. The stream that here joined the Glenelg he called by a native name, the Wannon. Still following the Glenelg, they entered on a less pleasant region \u2014 sterile moors, broken only by stunted clumps of stringybark, and in place of grass, frequent swamps of dark yellow reeds, and an occasional pool fringed by the melancholy she-oak. But still the river flowed majestically on between lines of graceful trees, always a hundred and twenty feet broad, and generally fifteen to seventeen deep. At the junction of a tributary which he named the Crawford, Mitchell again resolved to rest his teams, and forming a stockade, which he called Fort O'Hare he left the bulk of the expedition, whilst with his boats he once more took to the water. Down the stream he dropped, on cool and silent reaches \u2014 deep and dark flowing; the banks were high, and often showed limestone cliffs of great beauty. The creamy whiteness of these cliffs, carved out into architectural forms, or at times worn into fantastic grottoes, was reflected on the glassy breast of a current nearly two hundred feet broad ; where in these lonely expanses the wild ducks floated, and the duck-bill platypus dived. The stream still widened and deepened as they went, and Mitchell congratulated himsejf on the probability that he had at last found a river of navigable size. The water became brackish, which meant good news of the neighbouring sea, and on the great reaches the pelican was busy with clumsy bill. All at once the stream shallowed from thirty feet to four or five, and the sand that gleamed beneath told the usual tale \u2014 a fine river made useless to navigation by a fatal bar. Ahead of them lay lines of sandhills, broken by two rocky points, and between these points they steered till the roar of the surf was heard, and the long, pale green transluccnce of the breakers could be seen"], [111, "THE PORTLAND BA Y SETTLEMENT. 91 ON THE GLENF.LG RIVER, rolling up into crisp lines of foam on the sandy bar. The entrance to the stream had scarcely water enough to float the boats, and with a sense of disappointment, Mitchell turned to row back to the encampment. With his whole expedition he then turned due east, following up the Crawford River, through generally pleasant country. On what he called the Rifle Downs, he found much inconvenience from the immense size of the timber; for the fallen logs that seamed and interseamed the path were so vast as to be not easily moved to let the vehicles pass; and when they got down on the plains, where now stands the town of Branxholme, the carts were in country softer and more boggy than they had yet encountered. Mitchell left his men to superintend the process of getting the party safely through this difficult ground, and himself struck south on a flying visit to Portland Bay. First he ascended a gentle hill, which he called Mount Eckersley, and wading through oat-grass up to the thighs, he stood on the summit to look out on the pleasant Portland Bay district. He could just obtain a glimpse of the bay itself, a shining line away to the south. Descending again, and turning in the direction in which he had seen the sea, he came, after a ride of fifteen miles, on the shores of the bay, and saw four miles away to the west some grey rocks under the grass)- cliffs that had a remarkable resemblance to wooden houses, and while he was looking at them through his telescope, his companion exclaimed that there was a brig at anchor round the point ; on approaching a little nearer, they found that the grey rocks were indeed weatherboard sheds; and as they followed a well-marked track along the shore, they met a man who told them that the brig was the Elizabeth, from Launceston, and that round the point la)- the establishment of the Messrs. Henty. Thither they proceeded, and were kindly received ; there, resting on chairs upon a broad verandah, looking out on a good garden with plenty of vegetables, and down on the .bay, and the whale-boats swung on their stanchions, Mitchell for a brief time tasted the comforts of civilisation, and heard the story of the two years' toil and enterprise of the Henty family."], [112, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 92 They confessed that on hearing news of the approach of strange white men, they had been alarmed, and had loaded up the only blunderbuss of the establishment to give the intruders \u2014 supposed to be bushrangers \u2014 a really hearty reception. Mitchell could afford to join in the laugh, no doubt, for his appearance at the head of five fierce-looking unshaven men, in blue and red serge shirts and tattered pantaloons, with red feathers stuck in their ding)' caps, must have been as ferocious as that of any bandit who ever stepped out upon opera or melodrama. Next day he went on to Cape Nelson, and made some observations, and in the afternoon was about to take leave of the settlement when the appearance of a whale was announced, and he stayed to watch the dangers and excitement of the hunt. With a little flour to eke out their sailing supplies, Mitchell and his flying party reached the camp, from which a course was made north-east towards the southern extremity of the Grampians. The bold peak which he called Mount Abrupt attracted his attention as a likely place for a good view, and ascending its lofty brow, he enjoyed from a new point the splendid panorama of Western Victoria, behind him the grand outlines of the Grampians, \u2014 purple peaks one after another melting into blue, and then to hazy grey away to the north. But on every other side there spread a vast expanse of open downs, lightly timbered as though laid out for a deer park, and all richly grassed, awaiting only the arrival of the flocks that should make many a pioneer wealth)'. On the south, away beyond this open country, there lay the shining level of Portland Bay, with Lad)' Julia Percy Isle rising from the silver streak. As he stood on that breezy summit, looking on the plains far down below, Mitchell was careful to map out mentally his future course, so that he might avoid the swampy hollows and the land too green to be firm. So he descended, and moving still north-east, he traversed the charming country, seeing, as he says, to right and left, vales so sweet and inviting that it seemed a pity not to stay and explore them. But in spite of his care in selecting his route, the cattle after a week or two were exhausted by the toilsome work of dragging the drays by main force through the yielding soil. They must have a week of rest, and yet provisions were by no means over abundant in view of the long journey of short stages that lay before the expedition. Mitchell therefore determined to push on with a small part)', leaving his overseer to rest for a fortnight, and then to follow by slow stages; by that arrangement he could direct a supply of provisions to be sent back to meet them half way. Accordingly, he left the main body of the expedition pleasantly encamped at a spot due north of Warrnambool, and on the following day crossed a fine river, which he called the Hopkins. His course led towards that peak in the Pyrenees which he called Mount Cole, still over vast open plains fringed with forests and embellished with lakes, and from the brow of that peak, as well as subsequently from Mount Greenock, he looked with delight over a land which he says was the most favourable for colonisation that could be imagined. \" Flocks might be turned out upon its hills, or the plough at once set a-going on the plains. No primeval forest required to be first rooted out here, although there was enough wood for all purposes of utility and ornament.\" His course took him near the site of Clunes, and so to the situation of Castlemaine. There he ascended Mount Alexander, called by him Mount Byng, and from its summit he saw a much more wooded view. Especially he saw the great stretch of forest-covered hills that we now call the Dividing Range. These raised their sombre curves in long lines to the south, breaking the view in a seaward direction. Mitchell longed to stand on the ridge and see what la)- beyond. His wish could be gratified without interposing unnecessary delay, for in crossing some rock)- ground in the ranges near Ballarat a bolt of one of the carts had broken, and it was"], [113, "THE PORTLAND EA Y SETTLEMENT. 93 found necessary to wait a day to repair it. So he started at daybreak on 30th September to visit the mountains to the south. With a pleasant ride, crossing many streams, seeing and naming the Campaspe, a deep stream among level grassy uplands, he steered for a bold hill to the south-east, which he afterwards called Mount Macedon, a classical whim; the port being Port Phillip, he would call the mountain Macedon, and so commemorate the conqueror of Greece- Philip of Macedon. The richness of the country was shown by the size of the emu-herds\u2014 they disturbed one with twenty-nine birds\u2014 but they stayed for no hunting, and reached the southern slope of the mountain at the modern site of Woodend. The ascent offered no difficulty ; up the woodland slopes they rode to the very summit, with no impediment except from the vast thickness and length of the fallen timber. The top was not a peak, but a broad area of many hundred acres; it was, however, so densely wooded by mighty forest giants that it was a long time before a spot could be found from which a partial view could be obtained of the plains that lay to the south, and the glimmering streak that indicated Port Phillip. A dim cloudy line beyond it on the far horizon he recognised as Indented Head. At that time, if he could only have seen it, there lay behind those faintly nebulous woods of the lower course of the Yarra an infant settlement, whose cluster of huts and tents lay in pastoral quietness in the midst of that great extent of primeval solitude. After noting the fine gullies on the southern side of the mountain, with their tree-ferns and thickets of musk-trees, Mitchell and his companions descended at evening to the Woodend district, and there found a yard or two of dry turf to make their couch upon. He would have re-ascended next day, but the weather was cloudy and unpropitious, and the part)- returned to their companions, passing on their way the Cobaw Falls on the Barnard River, which Mitchell evidently in a mood of admiration, declared to be the most picturesque he had ever seen. The whole party now moved forward through interminable ranges of low wooded hills to the present site of Seymour, sometimes having to cut a track for their carts through the light scrub that covered the country; then across the Goulburn River through the hilly country behind Yea, and they gladly emerged on the level and only thinly-wooded districts around the present situation of Mansfield. Then they came in sight of Eeathertop and the Buffalo Ranges, and saw their rounded tops glistening with streaks of snow; and other snow-capped peaks to the south-east Mitchell called Mount Aberdeen. To avoid these ranges, a bend was made to the north, and they crossed the Ovens near the site of the modern Wangaratta. On this part of their journey one of the small party was drowned in a boggy stream while trying to swim a horse across. His body was buried in the wilderness, while his companions had to hurry on. They crossed the Murray, they crossed the Murrumbidgee, and so were in the regions of comparative civilisation. Mitchell caused provisions to be sent back to meet the overseer and his party. He himself went on to Sydney, where he compiled for publication the story of this important expedition \u2014 not dangerous, not romantic, not heroic, but of extreme interest, inasmuch as it made known a region of great natural beaut)- and advantages, lying ready for the advent of settlers; it corrected the gloomy and discouraging reports that had gone abroad as to the character of this part of Australia, and the descriptions given by Mitchell of what he called Australia Felix undoubtedly had a great effect in rousing' that enthusiasm for her attractions which afterwards was of so much service to the Port Phillip district in bringing population to her shores. In his map he sets down the name only on the western part of Victoria, from the Glenelg to the Goulburn, but in popular reference it vaguely described the whole of the colon)-, and in the first ten years of the colony's existence it was a term often employed both here and in England."], [114, "CHAPTER VII. John Batman. JIJHE settlement made at Portland had little in- fluence on the general history of the colony NATIVE CHIEF ESCORTING JOHN BATMAN. It was content to hide its light wholly under a bushel. The Henty family had no wish to found a colony, their only object being the occupation of land for themselves, their flocks, and their whaling parties. But the story of John Batman is very much more bound up with the history of Victoria; for, whether he so intended it or not, he certainly was the pioneer of a great wave of immigration, which in less than ten years converted the waste lands of Australia Felix into a well-recognised and prosperous colony. He was the son of a certain William Batman who had landed at Sydney in 1797, and had settled himself at Parramatta, where he had lived a life of quiet prosperity, gathering round him a respectable business and a little family of three sons and a daughter.' Two of the sons, John and Henry, are connected with the story of Port Phillip. Of these, the eldest, John, was born in 1800 in that sunny township, \u2014 dark with convict memories. There he grew to tall and somewhat burly proportions, was apprenticed to a blacksmith, but found his inclinations bent upon a life in the bush. He had many a time found his way far in among the lonely forest stretches towards the Blue Mountains, and had joined his fellow-townsman, Hamilton Hume, in some of his minor explorations. That free life of the woods suited his disposition, and at the age of twenty-one he abandoned his trade and went to Tasmania, where land was then easily to be had by people likely to use it. He got his grant of some thousands of acres upon the romantic banks of the Esk, and under those abrupt cliffs of Ben Lomond that throw their pillared front 5000 feet from the timber-covered plains. It was a land of beauty, but too rocky, too rugged, too densely wooded to be a chosen place for sheep. Nevertheless, he had a wide tract of ten or twelve square miles, and as he managed with care he was fairly prosperous. The wild life of rough riding adapted itself well to his young and buoyant spirits; but, in addition, he was in a colony which at that time provided many sources of excitement to an 1 The facts of the early life of Batman were gathered with assiduous care in Parramatta years ago by Mr. Bonwick, his zealous admirer, and are to be found related in several of the works of that careful writer."], [115, "JOHN BATMAN. 95 adventurous mind. First, there were the bushrangers ; up in the savage fastnesses of the mountain ranges they formed their haunts, whence they swooped down upon the settled districts. Many an expedition was organised against them, but for years they eluded all pursuit ; even when most of them, one after another, had paid the penalty of their crimes, the most notorious of them \u2014 Brady \u2014 for years continued his depredations and made his desperate escapes. Batman secured for himself some little reputation in the colony by following the outlaw, alone, up into the Western Tiers and down among the solitary lakes ; there, in the furthest depths of the forest, the wearied and wounded desperado surrendered to his pursuer. Another source of excitement was the war with the natives. The blacks in Tasmania were more determined in defence of their own rights than those of any other of the Australian colonies ; and so fierce, so frequent, were their attacks on the settlers, that a war of extermination was at length resolved on. The white men proposed to capture all their dusky predecessors and deport them to some island home, where their power for mischief would be gone. A number of parties were sent out by the Government, and a reward offered for ever)- black captured by their efforts. Batman, at the head of a party of ten crown prisoners, spent many months in this arduous work. Up and down the mountain ranges, they wandered far behind Ben Lomond in the untrodden wildness of forest-covered ranges and scared)' passable ravines. In one of those deep valleys he had to fight a sanguinary battle when suddenly attacked by a fierce tribe; but as a rule he adopted the most friendly tactics, and tried to win the confidence of a race whom he thought most cruelly used. He succeeded in one of his raids in capturing three women, with seven other natives, and he conceived the idea of training these women to visit their ill-starred countrymen, in order to explain to them the real views of Government in regard to them; to point out to them the miser)- they were bringing upon themselves by defiance, and the comfort they mi\"-ht secure by submission. Batman himself treated these poor women so well, at his home, and Mrs. Batman won so completely their simple confidence, that quite a body of warriors visited him and voluntarily placed themselves in his power. Another plan he suggested was to bring over some of the \"tame\" natives of New South Wales and utilise them after the same fashion. Eleven of these were imported by Government and placed under his direction, and although not altogether so successful as had been expected, still it was subsequently recoo-nised that Batman had been one of the two main elements in the eventual settlement of this difficult business. But, meanwhile, Batman had had his income to make by the more prosy work of sheep-farming, and he had likewise married after a romantic fashion suitable to the general tenor of his adventurous life. His forest lands were not well adapted for the industry he followed, and accordingly he heard with interest of the remarkably fine sheep country crossed by his old friend Hamilton Hume in 1824. Those open plains of rich and scarcely broken grasses, all lying ready for the advent of woolly flocks, fired his restless imagination; and so, as we have seen, in 1827, along with his friend Mr. Gellibrand, a solicitor of Hobart Town, he applied for a grant of land at Western Port, when the attempt was made to form a settlement there. The)- proposed to earn- over stock to the value of including about 2000 sheep and 30 head of fine Devon cattle, as well as some excellent horses; but their proposal was declined, as the Sydney Government had already determined to abandon the place. The voyage of Captain Sturt in 1829 seems to have re-awakened the enthusiasm of the Tasmanians as to the fine lands across the Straits. Those vast plains of the richest Vol. I. N"], [116, "96 VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. meadows, with rivers of never-failing waters flowing through them, seemed a land of fascination to the sheepowners, who found their flocks increased far beyond the sustaining powers of the somewhat narrow limits in Tasmania that were suitable for wool-growing. Hence we find\" eight of these gentlemen applying, in 1834, for tracts of this new land, of from five thousand to twenty thousand acres apiece, at five shillings an acre ; in their application they stated that there was then much difficulty in getting any extent of tolerably good sheep land in Tasmania. But this application was addressed from Launceston to the Secretary for the Colonies in London, and long ere an answer could return, John Batman and his friends had resolved on immediate action, reserving the question of Government permission until afterwards. At the close of 1834 Batman invited a number of friends to his home to spend the New Year holidays. An expedition was planned on the last day of the year to leave the hot plains, pass the night on the brow of Ben Lomond, and from that lofty eminence see the New Year's sun arise. It is said that on that merry trip, the talk turned greatly on the narrow limits of sheep lands in Tasmania, on the sunny plains of waving grass lying all lonely and unoccupied only two days' sail to the north, and ere they separated it was agreed that they would form an association to occupy these lands, even if they should go as mere \" squatters,\" without license or permission from the Government. But, as wise men naturally would, they agreed that some one ought to go over as pioneer to report as to the practical working of their plan. Batman was selected, or more probably volunteered for this service, and others promised to join the new association if his visit should prove satisfactory. Some little time was needed for preparation ; but early in May the Rebecca, of thirty tons was lying waiting for him at Launceston, and on Sunday, 10th May, he went on board, accompanied, by Mr. W. G. Sams, one of the association.3 Next day they dropped down the Tamar, but at the mouth of the river they were detained many days by the furious westerly gales that prevailed. Mrs. Batman, hearing of their detention, drove over and joined her husband, to make the most of the last few days of his company, ere he started on what she regarded as an enterprise fraught with danger. At length, on iSth May, the Rebecca stood out to sea, the devoted wife driving out to the lighthouse, and watching the fading sails till gone from sight. Yet still those wild westerly winds prevailed. Progress was impossible, but Batman had naturally some dislike to the idea of putting back again to the Tamar after a futile attempt, and chose instead the harbour of Port Sorell. The Rebecca had \"jumped about like a kangaroo,\" and Batman had been miserably sick; no doubt the calm waters of Port Sorell were at first welcome enough ; but after lying there a week with constant storms blowing outside, he became, Labilliere, Vol. II. p. 36. :' There are three documents which form the authorities for the facts of this voyage. First, Batman's Journal, now in the Public Library at Melbourne; it has frequently been published. Second, Batman's letter to Governor Arthur dated Hobart Town, 25th June, a fortnight after his return. This is to be found in an appendix to the sessional papers of the House of Commons under date 1836. Third, Extracts from log of the Rebecca, published in Bonwick's Port Phillip Settlement, page 198. The dates in this last document are wholly discordant with those of the two others, being generally a month later, but it is certain that they are wrong. For the extracts from the log give the date of Batman's return as being 8th July; yet the record office at Hobart shows that Governor Arthur replied on 3rd July to Batman's letter, dated the 25th of the previous month. Mr. Bonwick, whose accuracy is generally most praiseworthy, has made some mistake in regard to this document, which purports to be drawn up by Robson, captain of the Rebecca. Now we know from other sources that Robson was only the mate, and that the captain's name was Harwood ; hence the reputed log is in all probability only the memoranda of the mate, drawn up in after days when the facts of this voyage became the subject of public interest. Batman's Journal is by far the must authentic, having, as it shows under several dates, been entered from day to day."], [117, "JOHN BATMAN. 97 as he tells us, almost mad at the delay. On 26th May they faced the sea once more, but again had to take refuge eighty miles further west. The sloop, it must be remembered, was a very small craft for so stormy a passage, and few people now-a-days can rightly judge the difficulties and dangers of the voyage. At last, on the evening of 28th May, almost in desperation, they seized an opportunity, .and made a dash across the Straits; passing the shores of King's Island, they were, on the following evening, close to the entrance of Port Phillip. All night they lay off and on, but in the morning about nine o'clock sailed in and anchored in smooth water near the entrance to Corio Bay. Immediately they landed, and all was excitement in a chase after a dingo, the nine Sydney blacks whom Batman brought over, and his six dogs, delighting their stiffened limbs in a hunt, which led to the death both of the dingo and of a dog, which it killed. Batman, with the captain and some of his natives, spent his forenoon in a walk of four or five miles over the land where now stretch the onion fields of Portarlington. The sandy soil was rich in colour, and covered with kangaroo grass nearly a foot in height and green as a field of young wheat. On the shore were seen places where natives had quite recently been eating mussels, but they themselves were nowhere observed. He then turned in another direction for four or five miles, over gentle hills, all grassy, but studded with wattle and she-oak and stunted gums ; acres upon acres of land la)- waving with the rich oat-like grass, and not a tree upon it of an)- importance. The)- started some kangaroos, but failed to run them down, and after a walk of twelve miles in all, returned to the ship, pleased with their ramble in what was a perfect squatter's elysium. The Rebecca was then brought down to Geelong harbour, and anchored for the night. From the deck Batman looked out on the park-like lands that everywhere sloped to the pretty bay, and marked the bare but grass)- summit of the Barrabool Hills as being the object of his next day's excursion, whence he might view the land in wider prospect. Accordingly, on the next morning he was again on shore, wading over the knees in grass of astonishing richness, and so clear of timber that rarely could a dozen trees be counted to the acre, and these only small she-oak and wattle sufficient to make a pleasant shade for sheep in the sultry afternoons of summer. He walked over twenty miles through lands which, he said, seemed to have been \"laid out in farms for some hundred years back, and ever)- tree transplanted,\" and on returning to the vessel in the afternoon he made an entry in his diary to the effect that he was \"quite delighted with Port Phillip.\" In the evening the Rebecca ran across Corio Bay and anchored on its northern shore in a small harbour at the mouth of Hovcll's Creek. Inland a mile or two they could see through the twilight \"-loom the gleam of fires, and as Batman was anxious for an interview with the natives, they made preparations for an carl)- start next morning. Accordingly, they were all astir at two o'clock, in the hopes of reaching the natives' camp before daybreak. There was a starlight row, a disagreeable walk in the raw- morning on shores that were ankle deep with mud ; yet when the)- reached the still smouldering fires the blacks had all decamped, leaving their seven large huts still standing. Their track was plainly visible, and the Sydney natives followed it up, while the rest of the party spread themselves out in a line on either sidc. So the)- travelled for about three miles, when one of the trackers made a signal, and the line closed in to find that an old woman had been captured\u2014 a cripple who had lost all the toes upon one foot. The remainder of the tribe could be seen a mile further on across the level surface of the Werribee plains, and the white men gave chase. About one o'clock"], [118, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 98 in the da)- the fugitives were overtaken, a success to be explained only by the fact that the crowd of blacks consisted solely of women, twenty in number, and all but one of them encumbered with at least one child. The Sydney blacks were then divested of those habiliments which indicated their progress in civilisation, and, decorated only with a meagre toilet of beads, they advanced to the parley. Batman relates that the women partially understood the language of the Sydney men; but that could scarcely have been the case, any more than an English rustic would be likely to follow the words of a German stranger, however cognate the two languages may be in their ultimate origin. Probably, the conversation was rather one of signs, for which the Australian aborigines, like most forest peoples, display no small aptitude. The women explained that their husbands were absent on an excursion up the river, and were friendly enough to display their simple wealth, which they turned out of their various nets and bags. Batman then advanced unarmed, and made signs to signify his friendliness, and after a time succeeded in inducing the party of native women to return again to their huts, to which he had already caused a store of presents to be brought. They received a dozen looking-glasses, in which they doubtless scanned their features in admiring surprise ; eight pairs of blankets and thirty handkerchiefs, a tomahawk, a pile of apples, and six pounds of sugar, amazed and possibly puzzled them, and Batman concluded the ceremony by fastening on the neck of each a string of beads to lie on their dusky bosoms. The youngest of the women offered him in return a basket of her own handiwork, and two or three others came forward with their simple gifts. They then departed in evident surprise and excitement, and Batman turned his footsteps in the direction of the You Yang Hills. On ascending their bald summits he looked over wide-spread plains of grass, whereon 5000 sheep, the number he apparently thought of bringing over, would be simply lost amid the luxuriant pastures. A great number of turkeys were disturbed, but none were shot, and in the afternoon a violent hailstorm sent them back to their vessel, after a long and rambling day from the starlit hours before dawn. The thirty miles which Batman computed they had traversed was through uniformly good pasture land. Next day at dawn they were again afoot, and traversing the land at the head of Corio Bay, they struck inland up the banks of the little stream now called Cowie's Creek, far enough to find it first become fresh, and then degenerate into a mere line of rounded ponds, where duck and teal were shot. Having rested and dined by these pleasant pools, they crossed some five miles of well-grassed plains, and ascended those rolling downs called the Barrabool Hills, and again the prospect cheered their eyes, prophetic, as they were, of the woolly thousands that were soon to dot these wavy seas of kangaroo grass. The day was wet and cold ; a violent hailstorm caught them among the hills, and they were glad to make an early return to the warmth of their narrow cabin on board. Batman was satisfied with the extreme suitability of all the land round Corio Bay for the purpose he had in view; he wished now to see the head of Port Phillip, and in the morning the Rebecca weighed her anchor and stood along the western shores. The day was wet and cloudy, but whenever the fog for a time rolled off the plains, Batman, from the deck of the vessel, could view a long succession of the same level plains of grass running back for many miles to hills of equal verdure. In the afternoon they reached the mouth of the Yarra, with sandy shores of she-oak and tea-tree upon either side. Before them lay a bar with only six feet of water, and there, as they failed to find a passage, they cast anchor. Batman went ashore in the evening, and walked again through grassy lands, scaring from the"], [119, "JOHN BATMAN. 99 quiet river bends the pelicans and swans, the cluck and teal, that floated on their glassy surface. The quail were everywhere more numerous than he had ever in his life seen them m the most favoured spots. That night, on his narrow bunk below, there rested, doubtless, a head busy with dreams of the wealth these verdurous wastes would bring him in the prosperous future ; all unwitting that the hateful shears of fate were already preparing to close upon his thread of life, and that he should bring, from his forest home in Tasmania, all those loved ones of his to this newer and more hopeful home, only to lay him to rest, beneath those plentiful pastures that now gladdened his sanguine eyes. But with the morrow all was activity. A party was landed on the Williamstown shore to follow the river up its course, while Batman in the ship's boat rowed up the stream, sounding as he went. Hence it came that the walking party, cutting off the bends of the river, turned up the Saltwater instead of the main branch, and Batman followed them, without observing the other channel. When a little way up the stream he landed, and sent back the boat, keeping with him a strong party, and provisions for four or five days. There were Gumm and Thompson and Todd, and two of the crew, along with his nine Sydney natives \u2014 fifteen men all well armed. They travelled through those open lands, now dingy with the factories of smoky suburbs, for nearly twenty miles out upon the treeless plains. The river all this way was salt or brackish, and they had to scoop out a hole in a moist hollow when they camped in the evening near the present site of Braybrook. Under the moonlight it filled with clear water, and they spent the night in comfort. There was an early start next morning, and all day long they held on their way over grassy plains through a hundred thousand acres of land all ready to receive the flocks of the squatter. The)- followed the course of Jackson's Creek, and in a corner made by a loop of that stream, formed their camp for the night, not far from the site of Bulla. After tea Batman and four of the blacks followed the creek for some miles further before they returned to rest for the night. In the morning the whole party left the stream, and shaping their course over absolutely treeless lands richly covered with young grass a foot high, they reached the rounded hills where Sunbury now stands. In this course they crossed the woody banks of Jackson's Creek, which Batman called Eliza Creek after his wife, but for some reason nearly all the names he assigned to places on this trip were subsequently ignored.' From a grassy summit which he called Mount Iramoo, he looked for twenty- miles over verdant lands to the timber-clad ranges now called Mount Macedon. To the south and east and west he saw still the same verdant plains so suitable for sheep. As they all sat enjoying the prospect, the smoke of fires appeared in an easterly direction, and they set off at once to find them. But when evening fell they were still short of the position in which the smoke had been seen. They were now at the head of the Moonce Ponds Creek, and there in a tea-tree scrub they camped by the side of the little streamlet. A windy night blew over them in their thicket shelter, and with morning they were ready to follow the pursuit. For eight miles they pushed their way laboriously through grasses that reached their waists. Amid this tall herbage it was easy to see the tracks of some natives, and by following these they overtook a family, consisting of an elderly man, his wife, and three children. The blacks were not afraid ; the)- knew, as they explained, how well the women of the Werribee had been treated, and when Batman presented them with a pair of blankets, three knives, and other articles, the man grew friendly, and offered to conduct them to his tribe, a thing which Batman desired above all others. We must fancy the motley part)- on those plains by the Merri Creek. The naked warrior with the conscious pride of his long and"], [120, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 100 tapering spears on the one side, and his blanket bundle on the other; then the woman and her infants, and her burthen of miscellaneous goods; next came the goodly form of Batman, tall, stout, and a trifle florid, with dark hair clustering in careless curls round a handsome face; then his followers, each with a bundle on his back, two of them in sailor's costume, and three in the bushman's garb, while capering in and out with ever effusive spirits went the scraggy- featured natives in their baggy trousers and shirts. So the)- crossed the upper course of the Merri, and were holding their way over the plains when they were startled by shouts behind them, and looking back, saw eight men advancing with spears in threatening poise. Some yelling on the part of the guide was necessary to prevent an attack, but matters were soon on a friendly footing; and the naked warriors were good enough to accept a present of knives and tomahawks. The)- led the way to their camp on the Darebin Creek, where the tribe, numbering forty-five in all, gathered around the strangers. Batman and his part)- spent the forenoon among them, and made themselves as agreeable as possible ; eight stout looking fellows, whom Batman dignified with the title of chief, received an elaborate explanation of his intentions and wishes, of which they probably understood not one solitary item. Yet Batman flattered himself that the)' perfects comprehended his proposal to purchase from them the whole face of the counts)- over which he had been travelling \u2014 plains, hills, and rivers \u2014 \" about 600,000 acres, more or less,\" as he puts it in his journal. They agreed, as he thought, to sell him this vast tract, though on it there lived a dozen tribes as large or larger than their own; and in the afternoon he brought out two parchment deeds, with which he had duly fortified himself before leaving Tasmania. \" Know all persons that we, three brothers, Jagajaga, Jagajaga, Jagajaga, being the principal chiefs, and also Cooloolock, &c, do for ourselves, our heirs and successors, give, grant, enfeoff and confirm unto the said John Batman, his heirs and assigns, all that tract of country situate and being at Port Phillip, running from the branch of the river at the top of the Port,\" and so forth, the description including all the land from where the)- were to Geelong, and with a good!)- breadth in proportion ; while a second parchment set forth, in similar terms, that the)- surrendered to the same John Batman all the Indented Head Peninsula, with which they could not pretend to any sort of connection.1 But all due formalities were observed. A fallen tree was found by the side of a beautiful little stream of clear water, probably the Darebin Creek, near the site of Epping 'The originals of these deeds are exhibited in the Melbourne Public Library; they show that the greater part of the writing was prepared beforehand, leaving blanks, which are filled in with fainter ink, to express the extent and the bounds of the land sold, and also the names of the natives, who were supposed to be contracting parties. Eight sets of three snake-like strokes are there as the peculiar marks of these eight chiefs, and against each name a little seal of red wax gives the whole quite a formal air. And yet the British Government would have none of it ! The following is the full text of one of these deeds : \u2014 JHucito nil persons that we three brothers Jaga-jaga, Jaga-jaga, Jaga-jaga, being the principal chiefs, and also Cooloolock, Bungarie, Yan Yan, Moowhip, M.vnmarmalar, being the chiefs of a ceitain native tribe called Dutigalla, situate at and near Port Phillip called by us Iramoo and Geelong.

Then Batman signed, and James Gumm, Alexander Thompson, and William Todd affixed their signatures as witnesses. The natives, doubtless, grinned considerably, and were tickled by the little comedy ; but soon passed from these humorous proceedings to the serious business of accepting almost the whole of the bundles under which the visiting party had toiled these last few days. And when the bundles were opened the savages must have wondered at the open-handed generosity of the big white man with the curly black hair. Forty pairs of blankets and forty-two tomahawks, one hundred and thirty knives and sixty-two pairs of scissors, forty looking-glasses and two hundred and fifty handkerchiefs ; eighteen shirts, four flannel jackets, and four complete suits, together with one hundred and fifty pounds of flour \u2014 all for nothing \u2014 must have charmed the hearts of the dusky recipients; no wonder that they were, as Batman puts it, \"highly gratified and excited.\" The white men slept that night at the native camp. Next morning Batman spent in executing copies of his parchment deeds ; and, at ten in the forenoon, he was ready to start on his way back. He was considerate enough to leave one copy of each of the deeds with the natives; to study them at their leisure, no doubt, and detect any legal flaws. As he was bidding the natives farewell, two of them stepped forward and placed opossum rugs upon his shoulders, to testify their gratitude for the presents they had received. Batman now shaped his course south-west; for the first twelve miles through grass of three or four feet or thistles still higher, and generally with pleasant clumps of box, or gum and wattle on cither hand. Then he crossed the open, park-like lands now smoky with the brickfields of Brunswick, and down the slopes of the Royal Park, which still bear something of their original resemblance; through the lower ground of Flemington, down by the racecourse flats they trudged as the sun was dipping down to the western plains, and then they struck the Saltwater, which they recognised as the stream the)- had ascended, though they were now on the opposite side of it. This latter fact did not at first appear to them as of any consequence; they thought they had nothing to do but walk steadily on by the river side, and so to the ship. But they first came into a wide marsh, since then known as Batman's Swamp, and as they splashed along on its grassy margin they raised the quail in dense clouds; then they found themselves in a fork, with the Saltwater on the right hand and a the said tract of land with all advantages belonging thereto unto and To the use of the said John Batman his heirs and assigns for ever %o the intent that the said John Batman his heirs and assigns may occupy and possess the said tract of laud and place thereon sheep and cattle Tlidbing and delivering to us and our heirs or successors the yearly rental or tribute of Fifty Pair of Blankets, Fifty IOiives, Fifty Tomahawks, Fifty Pair Scissors, Fifty Looking Glasses, Tw.nty Suits of Slops or Clothing and Two Tons of Flour.

To reascend was out of the question, so weary were they all, but two of the Sydney natives swam across the Saltwater, and descended its banks to where the Rebecca was lying. It was now after dark, but the blacks attracted the attention of the crew, and a boat was sent up the river, too small to bring back the whole party, but large enough to carry them by instalments across the river, so that after another wear)' tramp of several miles they- were all taken on board. Batman and a native who had cut his foot enjoyed the luxury of a sail down to the Rebecca, where late in the evening they were all glad of something softer to sleep on than the grass, which had been their couch for four nights. Batman, doubtless, locked away those precious strokes and crooks of the brothers Jagajaga and Cooloolock and their fellows. He entered up in his diary that night the hope that his travelling on foot had now ceased for some time to come. On the following morning the vessel tried to work its way out of the river mouth, but the wind being foul it could not weather the point, and rather than be idle they got out a boat to examine the larger river that had been seen the previous evening. Round the Fisher man's bend they glided, and up the glassy vista, all so still, so dreamily rural ; till at six miles distance, where the stream was broken by a rocky ledge, they filled three casks and turned back to their vessel. That evening Batman, entering up his diary, noted down his opinion that \" this will be the place for a village.\" BATMAN*S HUTS AT INDENTED HEAD. Alt,-,- Wedge. On the following morning, Tuesday, 9th June, the vessel got under weigh, and with a light breeze sped down the Bay to Indented Head. Then the breeze increased ; the waters roughened, and it was with difficulty that they brought to for the purpose of landing a party to remain at Indented Head and keep possession of the land recently bought from the natives on behalf of the Port Phillip Association. Four boat-loads of provisions, amounting to several tons, were placed on shore for their use \u2014 potatoes, flour, and salt meat \u2014 enough to last for three months. Meanwhile, on board the Rebecca, Batman was bus)- writing out instructions for the guidance of the party to be left. They were to build a sod hut, and roof it with sods, so as to make it proof against spear or fire, leaving loop-holes from place to place ; they were to commence at once the formation of a garden, and for that purpose plenty of seeds were left with them, including those of fruit trees. Eight persons in all were to form this party, Gumm, Dodd, Thompson, and five of the Sydney blacks, Gumm, as leader, being entrusted with a formidable document, written by Batman himself, warning off all white men who might in his absence come trespassing on this land, his private property by right of lawful purchase. A whale-"], [123, "JOHN BATMAN. 103 boat was left with the party, and so after shaking hands all round, Batman and the people of the Rebecca ran across to Point Nepean. Next morning she slipped through the Heads, and in thirty-six hours after they were at the mouth of the Tamar. The journal in which Batman relates the story of this interesting trip is now in the Melbourne Public Library. Written in a poor hand, with, clumsy orthography, upon the cheap paper of a sixpenny note-book, it has nothing external to mark it as of value ; but that ink now fading with years is the same that filled up the blanks in the parchment deeds, and the form of the entries clearly shows in several places that it was entered up from day to day. It gives us every night, fresh from the impression of the march, a reflex of the sights and sounds of a silent land, so soon to be made populous and busy. On reaching Tasmania, Batman reported progress to his friends of the proposed associa tion, and under their advice a letter was prepared for Governor Arthur relating the story of his adventures. Mr. Gellibrand, the lawyer at Hobart, was probably the most active in preparing this document, and Mr. Wedge, the surveyor, who also belonged to the association, compiled partly from Flinders's charts and partly from Batman's verbal instructions, a map of his route. Unfortunately, both of these coadjutors departed from the plain simplicity that characterises the journal. The map does not tally with the diary, and not only is the letter made grandi loquent, but in many places the facts are exaggerated. Batman in his journal makes no special effort to induce the belief that the Port Phillip natives understood the language of the Sydney blacks ; but in the official letter, concocted with an evident purpose, this fact is brought into prominence. Thus, while the letter repeats in a vague way the substance of the diary, with occasional slips as to dates, yet in the manner in which matters are described, there is frequently added a little astute colouring, so as to increase as far as possible the claims of Batman's deeds to the recognition of Government, as being a genuine treaty with natives who fully understood the meaning of the transaction. At the conclusion of this letter the names are given of the association, and Governor Arthur is assured that they will do all that possibly can be done to secure good order and kindly dealing with the natives. They propose to take over 20,000 breeding ewes ; and many of themselves contemplate the choice of Port Phillip as their permanent residence. They will employ- as servants none but married men of good cha racter ; and they supply a copy of the indenture which they will make all their servants sign, according to which an)- person known to deal in any way harshly with the natives will suffer a heavy money penalty. Along with this letter, which, though prepared by another, was signed by Batman, there were sent to Governor Arthur copies of the two deeds, together with the cloaks and baskets presented by the natives. A week later came a reply from the Governor's secretary, expressing a kindly interest in the objects of the association, but advising them not to spend money in their project with any reliance on the agreement between Batman and the natives until the views of the English Government could' be ascertained. The Governor forwarded a copy of his own letter, together with Batman's report, and all the documents appended, to the Colonial office in London, where they attracted no little attention. For at this time the question of colonisation and of the manner of disposing of waste lands in new countries was engaging the minds of the most prominent British statesmen. From the year 1829, the bus)-, intriguing, indefatigable Wakefield, that brilliant theorist and pertinacious writer, had been spending all his energies in rousing the English people to some scheme of systematic colonisation. These were the times of dark days in England J of commercial distress following the great war; of agricultural distress so u Vol. I."], [124, "VICTORIA AND LTS METRO POLLS: PAST AND PRESENT. 104 severe that a royal commission appointed to inquire into it could suggest no remedy; of manufacturing stagnation, when the trades' unions first made a show of their power, and the Duke of Wellington ran up his twenty-nine heavy cannon into the streets of London, to clear them if necessary of the fiercely desperate mob. The redundant population of England presented a mass of seething danger. It heaved and chafed like a dark tide on an angry night against a long sea wall, and none could tell when that wall might break, and a wild inundation sweep over the land. Then came Wakefield and his books, his pamphlets, his inspired leaders, his Exeter Hall meetings, to urge upon the people the proper cure \u2014 emigration and the formation of colonies. But not the emigration of poor people who went to starve upon lands they had not the capital to make use of. He desired the English Government not to part with these lands, but at a reasonable price ; to induce men of means to go out and purchase this land, of which their capital would enable them to make proper use, and then these landowners would offer employment to countless thousands of the labourers of the old country, whose passage to the shores of the new communities would be defrayed by the price obtained for the land. These principles had many advocates. They were approved of by the British Parliament; and at the very time when Batman was landing at the mouth of the Yarra, the English Cabinet was appointing a Governor for a new colony in South Australia, to be conducted upon these principles. The application of the Henty- family for land at Portland Bay, and that of Batman and his associates for six hundred thousand acres round Port Phillip, together with similar applications from the West Indies and from Canada, arrived in London while the arrangements were being made for the foundation of colonies upon this \" sufficient price\" theory. A discussion took place in Parliament in the early part of 1836, of which the outcome was the appointment of a select committee on 8th June, 1836, \"to inquire into the different modes in which land has been and is at present disposed of in the colonies, and to ascertain that mode which would be most beneficial in practice.\" This committee consisted of fifteen gentlemen, and included Mr. William Gladstone, then a promising young orator, Mr. Childers, Daniel O'Connell, Mr. Roebuck, Sir George Grey, and others whose names are well known. They held many meetings, took a mass of evidence all tending to show that great blocks of land had been granted in the colonies to people so greedy of land which they could get for nothing, that they took thousands upon thousands of acres, which they could not possibly utilise; that thus the genuine settler was driven far afield for his small holding, while great tracts of unused land lay between him and the nearest convenient port. In Western Australia the granting of land had quite run riot in the hands of generous officials, to whom the addition of an extra cipher or two in the number of acres they were granting was a matter of no moment. In that ruinous experiment at colonisation, one man had been granted no less than 500,000 acres, a tract of land thirty miles long by thirty miles broad, and other wildly extravagant grants had been made, whose result was merely this, that the genuine settlers on small holdings were supposed to take up their residence in remote districts into which it was impossible to follow them with law courts, or police, or schools, or churches; every settler had to fight for his own hand, and in the process became hard and callous towards the black men and women who surrounded him, and put his life in danger. Even the system of allowing the colonial Governors to sell the land at what the)- thought a fair price was shown to be unfortunate, as there never was any fixed system, and oftentimes from an indulgent or interested Governor, great tracts could ' be got for small sums."], [125, "JOHN BATMAN. 105 The committee therefore recommended that in suture no land should be granted ; that all should be sold on terms of universal application, to be determined by the Imperial Government, and that the income so arising should be used in sending emigrants from the densely crowded British Isles to the new lands across the waters. The report of this committee, with all the evidence, was published in August, 1836, and a voluminous appendix was printed, containing fifteen documents relating to what is called the interesting and valuable exploration of Mr. John Batman, and to the application of the association which he represented. This application had reached England towards the end of 1835, at a time when the whole question of the disposal of waste lands was likely soon to be before Parliament It was seen and carefully examined by a weighty committee of the House of Commons, which took it into consideration before recommending that course, which was subsequently embodied in an Act of Parliament. Behind that Act the Colonial Office could not go. They did not and could not know that Batman was to be the founder of a great colony; and if they did, it was not their place to break the law for the purpose of rewarding him. Hence the criticisms often made, in which Batman is regarded as the victim of official indifference, are by no means just. His association received eventually a remission of seven thousand pounds of their purchase-money to repay their actual outlay in preparing for settlement, and with that allowance they had every reason to be satisfied. We shall see when dealing with their future correspondence, that the Colonial Office treated them with uniform courtesy, but firmly adhered to the policy determined by Parliament \u2014 a policy which had good points and bad ones, but was on the whole wisely chosen. But, meantime, in Tasmania the utmost excitement prevailed. Batman docs not seem to have in any way kept secret the results of his journey, and the colonists, who had for some years back been slowly learning that the shearing of merino sheep in Australia would be like the opening of a mine of gold, if only one could find sufficient stretches of warm, dry, grassy lands, to run them on, were everywhere roused by the discovery that not two days' sail from their shores lay vast unoccupied tracts of this very soil, millions of acres of the grasses that promised fortunes to the owner of flocks. Several writers who were in Tasmania at the time, have left their testimony that the feeling was in ever)- way quite comparable to the excitement fifteen years later, when gold was discovered \u2014 that uneasy feeling when men have the restless longing to be off upon adventure, yet wait for further news before they cast prudence to the winds. Some, however, were too eager to wait, and of these was Mr. John Helder Wedge, a surveyor in the employment of the Tasmanian Government. He applied for leave of absence to run across and examine the new lands on behalf of the Port Phillip Association, to which he belonged, and, when his request was refused, he at once resigned his position and started for Port Phillip, in order to give a professional report of the land and its capabilities. Along with him went Henry Batman, with his wife and four children. They landed at Indented JOHN HELDER WEDGE. From a PkotO. Head on the 7th of August, 1835, and found there on the grassy shores three sod-built huts, where the eight men left by John Batman had led an uneventful life until within the 'last few days. After building the huts they had dug up the soil on a small patch"], [126, "VICTORIA AND LTS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 106 of ground, sown some seeds, and made a few little excursions in the neighbourhood. The natives of the district had paid them a visit, and being allowed, according to Batman's instructions, a small supply of meat each day, had taken up their quarters in the neighbourhood; Wedge found no fewer than forty-six living close by the encampment, and on the most friendly terms with the white men. The)- had spent a very tranquil eight weeks; but a source of excitement had recently been supplied to fill their monotonous evenings with a little gossip. Up to the native camp had walked the strange figure of a man of unusual stature, naked but for a rug of kangaroo skins thrown round his shoulders and over his hairy chest; behind him his hair fell in long unkempt masses, and in front a widespread beard was tossed in brown tangles. His bushy eyebrows overhung the shadows, wherein there glanced a pair of small, suspicious eyes ; his forehead, low and brown with exposure, and his turned-up nose were both marked deeply with the scars of small-pox. He carried the spears, the shield and the club of a native, and advancing, sat down among the natives, at first taking little notice of the white men, who looked at his powerful frame with some concern, regarding him as a chief of note, and one whose enmity might be dangerous. But the natives, eager to give news, informed the settlers that this was a white man like themselves, and when Gumm went forward to make inquiries, he found it was even so. For, in truth, this was no other than that William Buckley who, a generation ago, had left the camp of Collins at Sorrento, and had spent these two and thirty years in the wandering life of the savages. He could answer no questions. His memory of his native language seemed completely faded; and the little that the white men gleaned was rather from the lively signs and ingenious pantomime of his black friends than from the hairy giant himself. This was the excitement of the station when Wedge appeared three days later. The worthy surveyor, though not a man of great education, was, in a mild way, fond of philosophising, and he made a study of this unusual phenomenon, whose story he transmitted to the Geographical Society at London. He gained the confidence of the uncouth giant ; had him restored to the conventional appearance of civilisation, and in ten days found him able to converse with some small fluency in his mother tongue. Then he received, little by little, the story of these long unnoted years, but the man was slow of thought and uncommunicative. Mr. Wedge drew out of him some vague idea of the life he had so long been leading, and some rude details of the manners and customs of the aboriginals. Indeed, Buckley at first promised to be of some little use in cultivating the friendship of the native tribes and rendering it permanent. When Wedge first landed at the encampment the men of the tribe were all away for the day on a hunting expedition, with the exception of one old native, who had stayed at home with his two wives and the young folks. Those who were at home welcomed him by shaking hands with him in European fashion, and by their cheerful loquacity, showed that they were on pleasant terms with the white men. In the evening the hunters dropped in by twos and threes with their kangaroos and bats, and were introduced to Mr. Wedge and Mr. Henry Batman ; but their attention was chiefly attracted to Mrs. Batman and her four little daughters, who particularly delighted them. A few days later Buckley had succeeded in giving Mr. Wedge a fairly good idea of each of the natives and his disposition ; information to which the watchful surveyor paid no little heed for future use. For it soon became plain that tact and discretion would be necessary in dealing with them. The quantity of bread, potatoes, and fresh meat that the clamouring blacks would eat at a meal astounded him, and he found that if an)- check was put on the"], [127, "JOHN BATMAN. 107 supplies, their resentment was quick and unreasonable. If a black saw knife or blanket or tomahawk which he coveted he first asked it, and then if refused coolly appropriated it ; when it was taken from him he might at the time offer no great opposition, but he was sure, sooner or later, to abscond with it, and after keeping out of sight for a time, would return without the article, but with an obtrusive air of innocence and unlimited assertions of honesty. In these difficult circumstances it was perhaps possible for a man of superior calibre, by the exercise of patient firmness and good-humoured tact, to avoid a conflict ; but unluckily the coarser natures of subordinates, ignorant, yet inclined to domineer when the)- had the chance, were not equal to the strain, and Mr. Wedge, from the very first week, was doubtful as to the possibility of preserving long that amity which then existed. After spending a week at the camp Mr. Wedge, accompanied by Thompson and two of the Sydney natives, with two of the natives of the district as guides, set out to explore the Indented Head Peninsula. He penetrated as far as the Barwon, and formed the opinion that it was the finest land for sheep-farming that he had ever seen, his only doubt being as to the supply5 of water in the summer season. He crossed and recrossed the Barrabool Hills, and skirted the marshy shores of Lake Connewarre, delighted with the great expanse of open grassy land on every side. On his return he was informed by the men at the station that the schooner Enterprise had passed up the bay on the day after he had left. He had heard before his departure from Launceston that this vessel was being prepared for some such expedition, and concluded that it brought over the pioneers of some new venture. However, he did not abandon his plan of making a complete survey of the peninsula he was on, and in a second trip, taking Buckley with him, he penetrated to the other side of the Barwon, where he found the family encamped with whom the wild white man had been sojourning of late. The meeting of the friends was affecting, but still more so their parting on the following morning, when the white men started back for Indented Head. Nullaboin and his wife shed tears when they saw their good-humoured associate quit them for ever. Wedge now had spent nearly a fortnight in his examination of the country round Geelong, and he was fully prepared to corroborate Batman's report as to its extreme suitability for the sheep owner. But he was now anxious to inspect also those fine rivers at the head of the port, and the plains that lay around them. Accordingly he embarked in the whaleboat which Batman had left, but finding her leaky and having broken her mast, he had to land and make the journey on foot. For three days he traversed those open plains of long and suc culent grass which skirt the western shores of Port Phillip, making a detour to avoid the You Yangs ; then he reached the banks of the Werribee, which his party crossed with some difficult)-, the stream being swollen, and running a fierce current of some twenty feet in width, with a rocky bottom. The river had some broader reaches of deep and placid waters, but with their loaded knapsacks upon their backs and their muskets of the heavy fashion of those times, they did not dare to trust to swimming. After turning down the stream for a mile they forded it, and camped on the open plains. Next morning they held on their course to the north-east, appa rently in not the slightest fear of natives, though there were but four of them \u2014 Wedge, Thomson, and two Sydney natives. After a march of three or four hours they struck the coast near the 5 Mr. Wedge's pocket-book is preserved in the Melbourne Public Library. In it are to be found, in a scrawling and school-boy hand, the records of these trips round Port Phillip, with many rude sketches of what he saw, and a quantity of miscellaneous notes and jottings, some having reference to his survey of the country, others not now intelligible."], [128, "108 VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLLS: PAST AND PRESENT. head of the bay, and passing through a narrow belt of she-oak, where now stand the streets of Williamstown, they emerged upon the shores of Hobson's Bay, startling five emus on their way. They were surprised to see the foot-prints of men, the marks of whose boots showed them to be no aboriginals, but seeing no one in the neighbourhood they made up their little camp for the night among the scrub by the wave-lapped shores that now are faced by the outlying dwellings of Williamstown, and by the side of their glowing camp-fire slumbered as lonely sojourners of the wilderness on the threshold of what is now so populous a region. Next morning they left the bay and struck to the north-east till the)- reached the banks of the Saltwater River, which they followed for some miles, finding it too broad and deep to be crossed. When at length it had shrunk from its width of twenty or thirty- yards to be a small freshwater steam only suffi cient in volume to turn a corn mill, and they were able to cross, the evening was at hand, and they camped for the night on the river-bank in a deep but grassy valley. At daybreak they began their journey down the stream, and reached the head of Batman's Swamp ; after having THE \"ENTERPRISE\" ON THE VARRA. followed ver)- much the course of the present Williamstown railway they ascended the fine grassy hills which are now West Melbourne, and traversed the pleasant glades of gum and wattle till they looked down upon the Yarra, a mile or so to the south. Its copious waters flowed in a channel some forty or fifty yards in width, and in the up-stream direction were parti)- obscured by the overhanging foliage. Amid the old fantastic branches rose the taper masts of a schooner, and the)- descended from their vantage ground to discover what intruders were thus located on the land marked out by Batman as the \" site for a village.\" There, in a broad basin of the river, just below the rocky ledge where Batman had stopped, they found the Enterprise, that clumsy craft of fifty-five tons which had passed Indented Head a fortnight ago. She was moored to the river's bank, but having alrcady discharged her stock and cargo was only waiting for the first fair wind to descend the river and return to Launceston. The people of the Enterprise received Mr. Wedge with civility, and made no unpleasantness when informed by that gentleman that the land on which they were intruding had all been bought from the natives by Mr. John Batman. They stated"], [129, "JOHN BATMAN. 109 their intention of remaining where they were in spite of Mr. John Batman, but offered to send with the Enterprise any letters Mr. Wedge might wish delivered in Launceston, an opportunity of which he availed himself. That night at the foot of the slope which now we call Queen-street, the rival parties camped side by side, the flickering fires lighting up the dark woodland recesses of gum and scented wattle. In the morning Mr. Wedge took breakfast with the settlers, and in a friendly conversation urged them to choose some spot in these wide lands other than that already chosen by Batman. They replied that in their eyes the treaty made with the natives was of not the slightest value, and were no way concerned when Wedge, on preparing to leave them in the forenoon, presented them with a notice, written in legal fashion, that they were trespassers on land belonging to another. In this notice he formally intimated that this was a portion of the land purchased by John Batman on behalf of an association, and trusted that the newly-arrived party would see the propriety of selecting such a situation as would not interfere with the boundaries described in the deed of conveyance, which he recapitulated for their benefit. There was no quarrel ; the party settled by the river treated the matter as one too trivial to cause the slightest trouble ; and they were magnanimous enough to give the server of this notice a supply of flour to enable him to continue his explorations. On leaving the Enterprise, Wedge followed the course of what is now the Sydney-road as far as the site of Brunswick; then turned a little to the left, and reaching the Saltwater, ascended it on its eastern bank to about the situation of Braybrook ; but, not wishing to traverse the same ground as Batman, he then turned to the west and crossed a plain of excellent land till he reached the Kororoit Creek, and halted for the night. Next morning he had a little variation to the monotony of journeying over the thinly-timbered plains. One of the Sydney- natives became sulk)-, and wished to go back to Indented Head. He was allowed to do so if he pleased, but on finding that he would have to travel alone, he sneaked after the rest as they turned to the north in order to trace the course of the Kororoit Creek. A range of woody hills which runs south from the main dividing chain, near Mount Macedon, attracted the notice of Mr. Wedge, who shaped his course for it, and after crossing several streams, camped for the night in the forest at its base. Next morning he ascended the ridge. He had proposed to hold on his way to the north-west, but now came in sight of the Dividing Ranges, blocking the way with their league-long waves of inextricable forest. He knew what toils would lie within those timbered ranges, so he turned to the south-west and again found himself on the plains, and after a few miles further reached the banks of the Werribee in its upper part. It was in flood, and though only ten or twelve yards wide, rolled onward with a current so impetuous that no chance remained of crossing either by swimming or by fording; and the white men were indebted to the experience of the blacks for the means of effecting the passage. A tree was found that bent some distance over the stream, and a log was stretched to join it to the other bank; over this, in the twilight dusk, the weary party crawled, and camped immediately beyond, but on short supply, for the ominous word was passed that the provisions were all but finished. Next day they took the nearest course for Indented Head, and after a long day's march struck their outward track. The)- had to camp with nothing to eat but the roots the)- could dig in the neighbourhood. On the following day the)- again traversed a wide stretch of land, but had to halt early on account of their having had no food but innutritious roots. Yet, again, a third day- was passed in a long march with neither breakfast nor dinner; but"], [130, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 110 it made amends by landing them in the evening at Indented Head where, no doubt, they emulated the natives in the extent of their supper, by the cheerful fire of a frosty evening. For two or three days Wedge and his foot sore companions rested from labour, and during that period, by the arrival of the Mary Ann from Launceston, they were put in possession of a free pardon for Buckley. All the members of the little settlement had taken a strong interest in that com mon-place mortal, whose romantic adventures were of a kind to seize upon the imagination; but Wedge had especially gratified his natural love of bustle on his behalf. From Mr. Wedge's Note-book. CROSSING THE WF.RRIBEE. Two days after seeing him, he had written to Governor Arthur at Hobart to secure for him a free pardon, for though thirty-two years had elapsed, Buckley was still in the eyes of the law an escaped prisoner, with a sentence yet unserved. Along with the letter which set forth his story and the prospect of usefulness which his knowledge of the natives presented, there was forwarded a petition drawn up in Buckley's name, but wholly the work of Wedge. In this document it was stated that Buckley had already done something towards the conciliation of the aboriginal tribes, and a promise was made that if pardoned, he would exert himself as far as he could to render permanent the good understanding that then existed. Governor Arthur had received this letter in the latter part of August, and had written granting the prayer of the petition. Three days later he caused a free pardon to be issued ; and it was this document which the Mary Ann brought over on nth September, to the delight of the whole party. The Governor, however, was careful to state that his action was not to be regarded as in any way an indirect recognition of the association and its settlers, whom he was bound for the present at least to treat as trespassers and adventurers. He wrote to Lord Glenelg, the secretary for the colonies, begging that the pardon he had issued might be ratified ; for, as he said, he knew by very dearly bought experience, how dangerous a foe such a man might be at the head of a tribe of resentful savages. To this request Lord Glenelg consented. During the four days he was resting at Indented Head, Mr. Wedge seems to have been ruminating over the evident anticipation of his association by those people up at the Yarra, and he considered that the sooner he put someone in possession of that fine site the better for their future claim to the district. Accordingly he joined the Mary Ann, which had been sent over by the association, and with her ran up to the Yarra, where he stayed a few days till Mr. Henry Batman arrived to take permanent possession ; for Wedge himself desired to make some further examinations, and almost immediately afterwards took the Mary Ann round to Portland"], [131, "JOHN BATMAN. 111 Bay to see what manner of country the Henty family had settled on ; and further to examine the land round Port Fairy, in order to be certain that the site chosen by Batman was in truth the best to be had for the purposes of the association. This occupied a fortnight ; then he sailed for Launceston, and was in his own Tasmanian home a week later, after an eventful ramble of over two months. The narrative of his trip, preserved in a show case at the Mel bourne Public Library, is contained in a long pocket-book, and is illustrated by nearly fifty rude drawings of what he saw, including a couple of delineations of Buckley, rather wild in regard to anatomy, but with an impress of truth as regards the features of the face. It is to Wedge that we owe the name of the Yarra. What the neighbouring tribes them selves called it, has not been ascertained ; but when Wedge, desirous of hearing it named, pointed out to a native boy the current that shot rapidly over the rocky ledge near the settlement, the boy exclaimed, Yarra, Yarra (or, as Mr. Gurner says it must have been, Yanna, Yanna), \"It is flowing! it is flowing!\" He took that to be the native appellation, and so the river has since then been called. During the years 1835 and 1836 the site of Melbourne was generally known as Dutigalla, that being the name inscribed on Batman's chart across the tract behind Williamstown. What it originally meant we cannot discover, but Batman thought he got it from the natives as their name for the district. John Holder Wedge is worthy of note as a pioneer of no little utility to the colony. Not only did he make the first rude survey of the country round Port Phillip ; not only was he among the first to bring sheep to its shores, and turn its fertile resources to profitable account, but it was he who by his kind-hearted exertions secured for Victoria the fair repute of having from the very first intended well for the aborigines, and of having made an honest effort to secure them from premature decay and to establish them in comfort. The early colonists as a community were anxious to give to the natives whom they dispossessed as much in the way of food and clothing as they could possibly have obtained from the soil in their own rude manner. Indeed, they would willingly have given them far more, and it is perfectly clear that our earliest pioneers would not have grudged to their sable neighbours a reasonable proportion of the wealth they drew from those smiling shores. They dreamt of civilising, converting, and educating them. It was not to be; but at any rate, the desires and aspirations of the community were such as we must look back upon without compunction or regret. It was largely due to John Holder Wedge that it was so. He it was who in the association always upheld the rights of the aborigines. He it was who, when the association's short-lived power was gone, stirred up the Colonial Office in London to sanction and arrange a plan by which a portion of the money received for land within the colony should be set apart for the use of the aboriginals. Comfortable homes were by his exertions provided for them in each of the great districts; and, if they sailed in all that was intended, they were at any rate an asylum for the aged and infirm, the weak and the oppressed \u2014 for all, indeed, among the blacks who chose to make use of them. It is pleasing to think that Wedge did not go unrewarded. He was the first holder of those lands on the Werribee since so well known as the station of the Chirnsides. There he prospered, and eventually returned to Tasmania to spin out the remaining years of a green and hearty old age. Vol. I. P"], [132, "FIRST STROLL ON THE SITE OF MELBOURNE. \u2014 See p. II CHAPTER VIII. 5obn pascoe Jfawkner \u2014 1835 To the untiring energy of John Batman, the colony of Victoria without doubt owed its origin ; and as we have seen, it was he who first marked out the banks of the Yarra as the site for a future city. It is true he removed his party to Indented Head, in order that on that peninsular situation it might be more secure from the attacks of hostile tribes, should any demonstration of force take place ; but it is clear both from his own narrative, from his map, and from the testimony of Captain Robson, then the mate of the Rebecca, that he had already fixed on the River Yarra as the head-quarters of the association. But to John Pascoe Fawkner must be ascribed the distinction of being the founder of Melbourne in this limited sense, that his party were the first who dwelt permanently within the city bounds, and that he himself built the first of its houses. And yet Fawkner had a far earlier acquaintance with Port Phillip than even Batman himself. As a boy he had played about the beach at Sorrento more than thirty years before, in the early part of the century. For his father having in London been convicted of receiving stolen goods, and having been sentenced to transportation to Australia, had joined the expe dition of Collins, which landed on the shores of Port Phillip in 1803. Mrs. Fawkner, described by Bonwick as a woman of most worthy character, was permitted to accompany her husband, and to bring with her her family. It was thus it happened that the future founder of Melbourne was one of that band of seven or eight children who gladly exchanged the confinement and sordid condition of a convict ship for a free scamper on the sands, and out into the unknown wonders of an Australian sorest."], [133, "JOHN PASCOE FA WKNER.\u20141835. 113 When the party crossed to Hobart the elder Fawkner served his time as a bondsman, but afterwards secured his ticket-of-leave, and settling down to the ways of respectable life, gathered something like comfort around him. The lad grew up to be a young man amid associations by no means the best for the formation of character.1 His intercourse at this time with people to whom laws and authorities were abominations, and whose talk was for ever directed against those officials, whose strictness they called tyranny, gave to his mind a rebellious flavour from its earliest days. He took the part of the convicts always against their rulers, and as he was bold and boastful, he soon passed into a condition of chronic opposition to all the rulers of the colony. His lawless temperament displayed itself in a restless change of occupation. In 18 14 he was engaged as a sawyer in a lonely district, where he took part in the building and equipping of a cutter intended for the escape of a number of Portuguese prisoners, then serving their sentences in the colony. The plot was treacherously revealed by two associates, and all who were implicated were sent to take their trial in Sydney. Fawkner was condemned, in addition to imprisonment, to be flogged, and the magistrate under whose care the punishment was administered, caused him to be strapped up in front of his father's door and there castigated. Doubtless the object of doing so was to suggest to the father the share he had indirectly had in the disgrace of the youthful lawbreaker. On his release, John Fawkner took up a farm of ninety-three acres some six miles out of Hobart, on the road to New Norfolk, and adjoining his father's farm ; but less than a year brought him to the end of that effort, his farm being sold under a bill of sale, and he sent adrift once more. Then he began business as a baker in Macquarie-street at Hobart, and again, though now six and twent)- years of age, he brought himself into trouble with the law and lost his business. The bitterness of his tongue, the unhesitating vehemence with which he threw himself into a quarrel, made enemies for him on all sides, and he removed himself to Launceston, where in 1823 he started a business as a baker. Here a more successful career began to open out for him, in spite of the fact that he posed as the convicts' friend, and took their part on all occasions against the authorities. At that time, of the two courts in Launceston, the inferior, in which were heard those causes that involved less sums than ten pounds, admitted anyone to plead in it whom the litigant or accused person chose to employ, this irregularity being due to a scarcity of lawyers. Hence Fawkner found ready employment on behalf of the convict classes in their legal experiences. The payment they made him could not be great, but the practice made him popular, and brought him well to the front in the little community. His glibness of tongue passed for eloquence ; his bounce was quite as useful in such a court as the soundest knowledge of law could be, and the audacity of his pleading, the pertinacity with which he often triumphed when a man of milder temper might have yielded to the magistrate, gave him quite a standing among the class in whose eyes he especially wished to appear well. The fruits of this popularity began to be seen when in 1826 he opened the \"Cornwall Hotel.\" For some years afterwards that was the favourite publichouse of the populace at Laun ceston, and as Fawkner had now taken to himself a wife, she conducted the business while he 1 The only authority of any moment for the early life of Fawkner is Mr. Bonwick, who has spent much time and exercised much care in gathering out of the Tasmanian newspapers and Gazette files all that can now be known, indeed all that it is worth while to know about these early days of his. For the story of the founding of Melbourne Fawkner's letter to the Digger's Advocate in 1853 has been mainly used, but checked and supplemented by materials from Bonwick's and Mr. Labilliere's books, from Mr. M'Combie's \"History of Victoria,\" Rusden's \"Discovery, Survey, and Settlement of Port Phillip.\" the \"Letters from Victorian Pioneers,\" and Gurner's \"Chronicle.\""], [134, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 114 was absent pleading in the courts. In 1829 he added to these two callings the profession of a journalist, and the Launceston Advertiser, a newspaper started and carried on by him in the interests of convicts, became the chosen reading of the multitude, who loved to chuckle over the sarcasm and abuse which was poured out on most of those officials under whom the bulk of the people had at one time or another been disciplined. It is not surprising that the autho rities took the first opportunity of retaliating. In that same year, 1829, he was fined for har bouring a runaway convict, and in consequence on the next licensing day his application was refused. Accordingly another change of profession was necessary. He opened a stationer's shop and a circulating library, whilst he still continued to publish his newspaper. But the hotel was the more lucrative business, and in 1830, on his making a public apology to Mr. Gordon, the police magistrate, his license was renewed. As the Cornwall Hotel was a favourite resort for the captains of ships which entered the port of Launceston, and as many of these captains were engaged in sealing or whaling enterprises, the landlord could not but hear a great deal about the surrounding seas and shores; and from time to time the praises were sung of the fine lands lying untenanted on the southern coasts of Australia. Captain Young, of the Flying Squirrel, a well-known whaler, related how he had in 1833 sailed up Port Phillip and seen sheep-land on either shore which he had not seen surpassed in any country. And the crew of the Kate, which had also anchored in that harbour through stress of weather, retailed across the bar of the Cornwall Hotel fine stories of the lands the)- had there beheld; and to each as he smoked his pipe and lifted his beer to his lips, Fawkner listened with especial interest; for Port Phillip was mixed in his earliest memories with a pleasant dream of a sunny land. But besides his hotel, Fawkner had his circulating library, wherein a copy of Sturt's Travels was received about that time, and being fond of reading, he had followed the gallant captain down the Murray, and viewed in fancy those great meadows and wide-spread grassy parks of which he spoke. Another frequenter of the Cornwall Hotel was Captain Hart, of the Elizabeth, who had carried Edward Henty over for his preliminary survey of the Portland Bay district, and P'awkner tells us that when the Henty expedition was starting in the Thistle he had all but made up his mind to follow sooner or later to the same shores. During the following year, 1S34, Captain Hart took the Elizabeth to Western Port for the purpose of gathering wattle bark. So successful was he that on his return to Launceston he proceeded to charter a much larger vessel in order properly to prosecute this profitable enterprise. And as he took his ease in the Cornwall Hotel, he told the landlord that he had there seen numerous cattle running wild, the descendants of some lost, no doubt, from the settlement of seven or eight years ago; he told how one white bullock had been shot, and found as fat as if he had been primed for the market ; and no wonder, for never had the captain seen such fattening grasses. George Evans, a well-to-do plasterer, who was accustomed to wash the dust from his throat with the beer of the Cornwall Hotel, was another listcner to the traveller's wonders of Captain Hart, and Fawkner's zeal found in him a ready second. The two agreed to make an exploratory trip on their own account, but as the process might prove expensive, four trusty friends were admitted to the scheme. Samuel Jackson, a contractor, much respected in Launceston, and his brother William, who was a carpenter; also another carpenter named Robert Marr, and a worthy old sea captain, John Lancey, retired from maritime pursuits, completed the company. Towards the end of 1834, Fawkner wrote to an agent in Sydney instructing him to purchase a suitable vessel, as there was at that"], [135, "JOHN PASCOE FAWKNER.- 1835. 115 time none to be had in Launceston. The schooner Enterprise, of fifty-five tons, was purchased early in 1835, and had she appeared at once in Launceston, Fawkner would have anticipated Batman in his visit to Port Phillip; but her owner had a contract for carrying coal from Hunter River to Sydney, and the contract had to be completed ere he could give up the schooner. Accordingly it was the 13th of July, 1835, before she reached Launceston, and by that time Batman had already completed his trip, and had left his party at Indented Head. It is said that on his return he stepped into the bar-room of the Cornwall Hotel, and seeing people there whom he knew, he called out in a jocular way that in him the)- beheld the greatest landowner in the world. Sitting down and joining them over his glass, he told the story of his travels, his adventures, and the deed of grant signed and sealed bv naked savages. Fawkner was all afire now to be off, and so become the second greatest landowner in the world, or perhaps the very greatest of all. He and his associates commenced operations at once when the Enterprise arrived at Launceston two days later, and in a little more than a week they had her loaded and ready for the trip under the command of Captain Hunter. The expedition was, in the main, Fawkner's own adventure. The vessel was his property, and the others only paid him for their passage across, besides contributing seven pounds each for the purchase of a whalcboat, lest any exploration of rivers or shallow bays might be necessary. One of them, Mr. George Evans, took with him a servant, Evan Evans; but Fawkner took three servants\u2014 Charles Wise, a ploughman ; James Gilbert, a blacksmith, who was accompanied by his wife Mary Gilbert; and lastly, Thomas Morgan, the man who was to make himself generally useful. Fawkner supplied the provisions, the horses, the plough, the grain and garden seeds, the plants, and 2500 young fruit trees, as well as part of a wooden house, which in their hurry the)- would not wait to complete. Besides all these things for their own use the}- took a supply of articles with which to purchase land from the natives. They took clothes and blankets, tomahawks and knives, handkerchiefs and coarse provisions. And so, with a full cargo, Captain Hunter, of the Enterprise, stood down the Tamar, having on board all the association of six, with the exception of George Jackson, who was unable to get away. There was George Evans the plasterer, and William Jackson the carpenter, and Robert Marr, Captain Lancey, and John Pascoe Fawkner. On 27th July they set sail from the mouth of the Tamar with a fair wind. Fawkner's lean little figure, five feet two inches of egotistic humanity, no doubt patrolled the deck and patronised the expedition. But with evening the wind ; arose, and the bounding waves flew under the schooner with increasing speed; they began to curl their crests with foam, and a wild night set in. Fawkner disappeared to undergo the agonies of sea-sickness in private. But when two dismal nights and three tempestuous days were gone, the vessel was still within sight of the Tamar Heads. Fawkner could stand it no longer, and at his solicitations the schooner ran for George Town once more, where he was landed with a horse to take him back to Launceston. Then the Enterprise headed again for the north, and after a prolonged voyage succeeded in entering Western Port on 8th August. This harbour had been chosen by P\"awkner so as not to interfere with the purchase made by Batman, as he intended himself to make exactly the same sort of bargain with the natives, and it was cvidcntly good policy on his part to throw no sort of doubt on the previous transaction, but rather to show the most scrupulous regard for the rights supposed to have been in that way acquired. But he was not himself on board to direct affairs, and his associates were not"], [136, "116 VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. much impressed by the wisdom of this policy. They wished merely for runs which they might hold on sufferance as squatters, and as Western Port fell very far short, for pastoral purposes, of what they had heard of the Gcelong district, they merely spent a week in examining it carefully, and on the 15th of August the Entei piise sailed out of Western Port and passed round to the entrance of Port Phillip. As she made her way up the channel a whaleboat pushed off from the Oueenscliff shore and met her. The crew consisted of half-a-dozen blacks in nondescript clothing \u2014 these being the Sydney aboriginals left by Batman at Indented Head ; there was one white man in command, who boarded the vessel, and in a civil way explained that all the western side of this bay belonged to John Batman, and warned the passengers not to trespass on these lands, as neither he nor the association he represented would suffer any interference with the rights they had purchased from the natives. The four members of Fawkner's association who were on board took the warning in friendly part, determined not to quarrel with Batman's company unless it happened to suit them eventually, and after receiving a welcome present of some fine fish from the party at Indented Head, they carried the Enterprise over to the opposite side of the bay and spent four days in examining the eastern shores, slowly ascending along the south channel. They landed from point to point, beginning at Arthur's Seat, and at each place pushed inland for three or four miles, but found no district that satisfied all requirements for a successful settlement, such as might be reasonably expected to grow into a thriving town. Fawkner had, in especial, cautioned them against selecting any spot that was not on the banks of a good freshwater river, and so it came that on the 20th of August they anchored in Hobson's Bay without having discovered a spot to suit them. They knew of the Yarra, and it was now resolved to examine its banks, with a prospect of making a selection there without further troubling themselves to respect the rights which John Batman and his friends might suppose themselves to possess. Next morning all four, George Evans, William Jackson, Robert Marr and Captain Lancey, with two of Fawkner's men, pushed off in the whaleboat to ascend the river, carrying with them provisions for the day. Again it happened that the wrong arm was followed, and they found themselves at length stopped by fallen logs at a place where the stream still consisted of brackish water. They found no spring or rivulet at which to quench their thirst, and in their disappointment gave the stream the name of the Saltwater, which it still retains. Evidently this was no place for a town ; they turned back, and in the evening reached their vessel, tired and fretful at their unavailing labour. Next morning the boat was once more manned, and forth they went to explore the other branch. On reaching the junction they kept to the right between low banks of marshy aspect, where the grey stems and twigs of the tea-trees lined the stream like a wall on either hand ; teal, duck, geese, and swans rose flapping from the silent waters at each bend, as they urged their rippling boat up the middle stream. After rowing for an hour and a quarter they found the river widen into a broad basin, beneath whose glassy bosom the depths descended to fully thirty feet. Before them, over- a rocky ledge, the waters fell some two or three feet in a little cataract, murmuring down into the tranquil basin. It was the time when wattles freely bloom, and their golden-tufted sprays made either side of the river gorgeously gay, and far down in the limpid river the tremulously reflected arches of green and gold made a delicate framework for a broad expanse of blue heavens down beneath, over which the glossy cloudlets dreamily crept. The banks were covered with a short green sward that looked like a flower-bespangled velvet, and to the practical eyes of these visitors it was a special delight to find the water three fathoms"], [137, "JOHN PASCOE FA WKNER.\u20141835. 117 deep up to the very edge of that turf. There was no dissentient voice, nor' any discussion. Here must be the site of the settlement, and an endless search could reveal no fairer situation. They landed, tied up their boat, and strolled up the hill to the place which the Law Courts now occupy, and there passed an hour or two of lazy enjoyment. It was near the end of August, when the unfolding warmth of spring brings a wonderfully balmy feeling over an Australian landscape, and every fresh breath of breeze that wafted up from the broad river came laden with the charming perfume of the wattle blossom, and from the dense thicket that now is Elizabeth-street the summer-birds and the parrakeets twittered at their spring-time tasks. Beyond the thicket they watched the sunlight flooding the dreamy woodlands of Bourke and Lonsdale and Russell streets. The afternoon was far advanced before they loosened their boat from its mooring in that pleasant spot, and evening was on them as they clambered one behind another up the sides of the Enterprise. Round their pannikins of tea that night upon the poop, the chat was cheerful and the omens hopeful. During the past two days Captain Hunter had sounded over the bar, and found the track close by the Williamstown shore that was most suitable for navigation ; a few crazy stakes and poles already indicated the course by which on the morrow he was to guide the Enterprise up the stream, the first of the tens of thousands of vessels which since then have made that water-way so busy. Next morning the vessel was towed across the bar, and a long day's work was occupied in pulling her by main strength up the river to the junction of the two branches ; the wind was unfavourable, and sunset saw them only three miles up, when they made fast the vessel to rest for the night. In the morning they rounded the bend, and then the breeze that had been useless overnight wafted them lightly and easily up, on that pleasant Sunday forenoon, into the basin that had charmed the explorers on the previous Friday. The Enterprise drew up to the bank, which is now the Queen's Wharf, just at the foot of William-street. The water was deep enough, but so close were the big gum trees along the edge that a few of the long gnarled branches had to be sawn away in order to admit the masts of the schooner. And when the vessel was drawn under her leaf)- covering, and the two taper spars of her masts were embedded in the maze of gum-tree branches and wattle foliage, a plank was laid from her bulwarks to the spring}- turf, and the passengers landed upon the soil of their new home. The two horses, which had borne up well through their six weeks' of voyaging and confinement, were slung out and deposited on the meadowy banks, when they evinced their delight by a scamper down the woodland glade of Flinders-street, and a roll on their backs on the short sweet grass where the Customs House now rears its massive front. All were pleased with the aspect of their new home; the three dogs, in the delight of liberty, dislodged a big kangaroo only a yard or two distant among the thickets of the Elizabeth street gully, and it hopped away before them over the open grass where now the railway station stands, but was run down where the Prince's Bridge at present crosses the stream. There it took to the water and was killed, its bod)- being borne back in triumph to provide fresh meat for the evening meal. The afternoon was spent in the enjoyment of idleness, and the party slept on board that night. Nor were they much busier on the Monday, doing little but setting up their tent on the hillside somewhere near the junction of William and Collins streets. But on the Tuesday all was activity, for the Enterprise must be released. The stores, the plough, the goods for barter were all landed, and carried up the slope, and a hut of turf walls with a roof of grass erected to cover them if rain should set in. On Wednesday a similar building was constructed as a sleeping place for the men, and it was on the evening"], [138, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 118 of that day that Mr. Wedge, accompanied by another white man, with two Sydney and two Geelong natives, a motley party, came wandering down the hill from the direction of Hotham. He and Captain Lancey had a conference, and, as we have already seen, he gave the captain notice that this land had been bought by John Batman, a piece of information which the captain took in good part, but without the slightest intention of paying attention to it. Wedge stayed with them that night and breakfasted with them in the morning; then having politely handed them a written warning, as we have already seen, took his departure. On this same day, Thursday, the Enterprise dropped down the river, took in ballast, and was ready to sail on the following Friday, carrying with her fawkner's house on the yarra. \u2014 See p, i2o. After W. F. E. Lianlet. By permission of the. Trustees of the Melbourne Public Library. Mr. Jackson and Mr. Marr. At the settlement there were left seven persons: Captain Lancey, George Evans and his servant, together with the four servants of Fawkner, namely Wise and Morgan, and James and Mary Gilbert. These were busy preparing a small area for cultivation. The sound of the axe for the first time echoed through these immemorial glades, and great flocks of white cockatoos rose screeching each morning as the woodmen first began to make"], [139, "sOHN PASCOE FA WKNER.\u20141835. 119 the tree tops tremble to their blows. But so clear was the land that a day or two sufficed to prepare five acres, and then did Charles Wise yoke to his pair of horses, and guide his furrows up the gentle slope from Flinders-street to the site of St. James' Cathedral. A little more than a week after their landing, five acres of land were sown with wheat, and behind that, between William-street and King-street, a kitchen garden was commenced. From that time onward the site of Melbourne has been continuously the dwelling place of man, and the little spot these men adopted as their home has formed the nucleus of the city. At that time we must fancy them awaking on the silent hill in the early morning Morgan gathers the firewood from the gumtrees of Collins-street, and descends to the riverl edge to find a log from which he can dip his bucket in the crystal waters of the Lower Yarra; while Mary Gilbert is busy with her open-air cooking; and, the breakfast over, the labouring men proceed to their farming and gardening tasks, while Lancey and Evans keep watch lest lurking savages might be near. At six o'clock, as the darkness is closing round, they gather on the hillside where the slowly curling wreath of blue tells of the supper that awaits them. An hour or two with the cards and the pipe, then early to rest with the silent forest all around. A fortnight of that lonely life was passed, when a boat arrived, bringing back Mr. Wedge, who had no sooner reached Indented Head than he withdrew most of the party left there by Batman, in order to place them in possession of the land which had all along been Batman's real choice for the site of a \"village,\" as he called it. For this purpose Wedge had employed the Mary Ann, which entered Port Phillip Heads two days after he got back to the huts; and that vessel was now lying at the mouth of the Yarra. A clay or so later the whole party ascended the River, and Henry Batman, who was to be left in charge of it, built a hut of sods for his wife and five children a little higher up the hill, and close to the present site of Menzie's Hotel. One or two smaller huts were made hard by for Gumm and Thomson and Todd and the six Sydney natives who belonged to Batman's party, and also for William Buckley, who accompanied them. The two establishments, though rivals, and a little watchful of each other, were friendly enough, and after Wedge went off in the Mary Ann for his trip to Portland, they lent each other frequent assistance, and each gave to the other a seeling of greater security if any trouble should threaten from the blacks. Meantime the Enterprise, with a rapid run, had reached Launceston, and Marr and Jackson had delivered their favourable news. Fawkner lost no time in completing his preparations for taking up his abode permanently in the new settlement. He even advertised in the Launceston papers, in order that any who wished to join in the new venture might secure passages in the Enterprise on her second trip. On 25th September that vessel was lying all ready on the mud at Launceston, waiting for the next tide to float her down to the Heads of the Tamar. She had on board Fawkner and his wife, together with Captain Lancey's wife and two children, as also three more men to be taken over in the service of Fawkner. Marr and Jackson both retired from Fawkner's association ; one going back to England, the other making a fresh partnership with John Aitken and James Evans, who chartered the sloop Endeavour, in order to cross and choose for themselves some portion of this fine unoccupied land, for the purpose of forming sheep stations. The Endeavour left the mouth of the Tamar immediately after the Enterprise, and as her skipper (Bellin) had never yet been in Port Phillip, he took advantage of the accident to follow the course of Captain Hunter, a fact which Fawkner, irritated at the supposed desertion of Jackson, in after years referred to as a sneaking way of crossing the Straits in the wake of other people. The Vol. I. o"], [140, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 120 Enterprise, without trouble, reached the mouth of the Yarra, and again ascended to the site of the settlement, which so greatly pleased the heart of Fawkner that in a letter written not long after to a friend, he exclaims, \"Please God here I will end my days.\" The self-satisfied little fellow was resolved that at any rate his name should descend to posterity, for he immediately christened the river \"Fawkner's River,\" and the little valley which now is occupied by Elizabeth-street, \"Pascoe Vale,\" a name which -was subsequently given to Fawkner's estate out at Essendon ; but neither of these appellations was used by anybody else. What the folks on board the Endeavour did on landing it is now impossible to learn, beyond the vague assertion that the}- explored the country in search of a sheep station. In all probability they at once travelled inland across the Yarra, and out into the plains to the north of the settlement. It was the ioth of October when Fawkner reached the encampment, and he seems to have lost no time in commencing the erection of the wooden house which had been imported partly in the previous trip and partly in this. But he was disinclined to go so far up the hill as the position chosen by Captain Lancey. He erected his dwelling on the land now occupied by the Market Square. Nor did he approve of the site chosen for farming purposes. He selected instead a situation on the south side of the river, where the land was more level, and the soil of richer aspect. There about eighty acres were broken up by the plough, and crops of potatoes, peas, beans, carrots, melons, pumpkins, as well as both wheat and Indian corn, were immediately sown. It was not long before the settlement was cheered by their appearance of vigorous growth, and eventually all but the Indian corn gave satisfactory results. The Association of Batman did not well know how to deal with this intrusion on their purchased domain. Wedge had given full information in his letters of September, and when he returned to Tasmania, towards the close of October, he found his friends much exer cised in mind as to the course to be pursued. A meeting had been held of such of the members as happened to be in Hobart, and there one or two of the more fiery spirits had talked of using force, and of inducing the natives to expel by violent measures these white trespassers on land which had been duly transferred to the association. But the wiser members vetoed these silly propositions. However, Wedge, in his home in the country, heard some vague reports of sanguinary proposals, and wrote to Batman a strong protest against them, apparently believing that both Batman and Gellibrand were of that way of thinking. This drew from Batman a manly letter disclaiming any notion of the kind, and stating that it ought not to be difficult to persuade Fawkner to cross the Yarra and settle upon the other side, beyond the boundary of the association's grant. What was eventually to be done the association did not decide, but in the meantime it was seen to be a wise policy to hurry forward the shipments of sheep that were to occupy the land. The Norval, a barque of three hundred tons, had already been chartered, and now arrived from Sydney to be fitted up at Launceston for the transport of the stock. John Batman himself, though in somewhat delicate health, superintended these prepara tions, and was daily on board suggesting means of securing the animals from damage if the vessel should happen to be caught by stormy weather. An extra boat was bought to quicken the landing of the stock on the shores of Port Phillip, the Norval being too large to cross the bar at the mouth of the Yarra. On the flowing tide of the 22nd October the Norval swung round the reaches of the Tamar, and anchored at the little port of Georgetown, near the mouth of the estuary. There five hundred pure-bred sheep and sift}- Hereford cows were waiting, and were rapidly placed on board. A wooden house was also shipped, and the passengers for Port Phillip took such berths as the)- could get ; John Batman himself going over to superintend."], [141, "JOHN PASCOE FAWKNER.\u2014 1835. 121 Dr. Cotter, for whom the wooden house was intended, went to be the manager on behalf of the association. Messrs. Ferguson, Cowie, Stead, and Steiglitz, who proposed to settle in the new district, though they did not belong to the association, obtained a passage on the understanding that they would not take up any portion of the purchased territory, but find new runs for themselves outside of its bounds. A number of men, including the remaining four of Batman's Sydney blacks, accompanied the expedition to act as shepherds in the service of the association. So equipped for the first squatting enterprise of Port Phillip, the Norval set sail with a brisk and favourable breeze, and in thirty hours after, on a pleasant spring morning, passed through the Heads and anchored a little way within them. The longboat was got out, and Batman ran across in her to Indented Head to see the men that still were there; but he soon returned bearing with him some fine vegetables grown at the little settlement, and auguring well for the prospects of farming in the new land. At two o'clock in the morning the Norval was safely anchored in Hobson's Bay; at sunrise, the boats were got out, four in number, and loaded with tents and stores. Then with all the passengers aboard, and Captain Coltish himself accompanying, they pulled up the river to the settlement. Batman in the foremost boat was guide, and took the procession by the proper branch up to the basin of the Yarra, and there selected a spot quite close to the falls as a suitable landing-place. P'awkncr, who had been settled close by for over a fortnight, and could not then have been far off, kept out of sight, prudently declining the altercation which might possibly have arisen. But the natives of the neighbourhood, who doubtless hovered round the dwelling of Henry Batman so long as rations were regularly served out, gathered to welcome John Batman, recognised by many as the munificent dispenser of gratuitous comforts. Two of the boats were sent back to the ship in the afternoon, but the other two, and all the passengers, waited for the night. Tents were set up, but the evening being one of tranquil moonlight, it was spent in open-air merriment. The blacks made the gloomy gum-tree shades of what is now Collins-street flicker with the fitful flame of their corroboree fires; and all night long their doleful music, the tramp of their dances, the ceaseless chatter, the abandoned laughter of the large native gathering rolled up the wooded valley and across the moonbeam ripples of the pastoral river. We can fancy the jovial Batman, out of sorts, but never out of spirits, joining in the burlesque jokes that tickleel the native merriment, while up in the unlit shades of the rising ground the lean little Fawkner, able, astute, and clever, but jealous and petty-minded, lookeel down with a watchful eye; those grimly tightencel lips of his prepared to threaten with the law anyone who dared to touch him or interfere with his property. Batman and his friends retired to rest in their tents, and at sunrise were up and manning their boats for a return to the Norval. That vessel was hauled as close in as possible to the beach, where now stand the piers of Williamstown, and the boats were employed all day in landing\" the stock. Load after load was swung out of the vessel and rowed ashore, to join the bleating crowd under the tea-trees, and the cattle followed them, the whole operation being completed without the loss of a single animal. In the evening a trip was once more taken up the river, to leave with Henry Batman's party at the settlement the remainder of the stores that had been brought for their use. Cowie, Stead, and Steiglitz remained to select runs for themselves, and chose their stations on the banks of the Barwon, outside of the association's estate ; while Dr. Cotter, intending to make the settlement on the Yarra his headquarters, caused his wooden house to be erected not far from Fawkner's, but a little higher on the slope of the hill. John Batman returned to Launceston, the Norval having a passage almost as smart as"], [142, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 122 that of our modern steamers. On his return, arrangements had to be made for the division of the association's estate among the various members, for they had never contemplated anything like a permanent partnership. They had lent each other mutual assistance in the expense of exploration, and still proposed to further each other's interest as far as possible ; but each was to have his own run, and manage his own stock. Wedge had brought over with him a rough map of the country round the port. On this the \" Dutigalla and Geelong estate,\" as the terri tory was called which Batman was supposed to have purchased, was divided into seventeen portions, each block being numbered for convenience of reference. Batman, as the originator of the scheme and the member on whom had fallen the toil and danger of its initiation, was CORROBOREE OE BLACKS. \u2014 See p. 131. allowed the first choice, and the others were to be assigned their shares by lot. Batman took for his selection the district north of the Yarra, including the whole of the present site of Melbourne and its northern suburbs, the limits of the district apparently lying some five or six miles beyond Essendon ; it was bounded on the west by the Saltwater and on the east by the Merri Creek. On the other side of the Saltwater Mr. Cotterill had his share, extending away to the west, and Mr. Collicott's lay south of that. Still further south, Mr. Wedge's allotment skirted the bay from Williamstown, which it included, down to the river Werribee. Mr. Gelli brand, Mr. Simpson, Mr. Connolly, Mr. Robertson, and Mr. Sinclair took portions round Corio Bay, while Captain Swanston, Major Mercer, Mr. Sams, Mr. Solomon, and Captain Bannister each received a block of the plains stretching north to Mount Macedon ; while Mr. Arthur, nephew of the Governor of Tasmania, had for his share a fine tract round the Plenty River."], [143, "JOHN PASCOE FAWKNER.\u2014 1835. 123 Thus each of them became, as he thought, the possessor of forty thousand acres of charming land in perpetuity. But while they thus complacently parceled out the territory among themselves, they were very well aware that the transaction would not be valid unless ratified by the Government under which they lived; and from the first no such sanction was in the least degree probable. In the previous August, while as yet there was nobody settled at Port Phillip but the small party left at Indented Head, Governor Bourke had issued from Sydney a proclamation warning them off as trespassers. He had heard from his subordinate lieutenant, Governor Arthur, of the pro ceedings and intentions of Batman and his association, and on 25th August he drew up a formal notice, headed, \" Proclamation,\" and ending, \" God Save the King,\" in which he said \" Whereas it hath been represented that divers of His Majesty's subjects have taken possession of lands of the Crown within the limits of this colony, under the pretence of a treaty, bar gain, or contract for the purchase thereof with the aboriginal natives, Now therefore I, the Governor, do hereby proclaim and notify that every such treaty, bargain, and contract is void as against the rights of the Crown, and that all persons who shall be found in possession of any such lands as aforesaid, without the license or authority of His Majesty's Government, will be considered as trespassers, and liable to be dealt with in like manner as other intruders upon the vacant lands of the Crown within the said colon)'.\" But though Bourke thus thought it necessary to vindicate the rights of his government, and to assert the necessity of regularity and the due compliance with law, yet personally he sympathised to a certain extent with the enterprise. He saw clearly enough that the colony hc ruled was destined to be a great wool producing country, and that only by a great deal of friction and costly repression could the owners of flocks be prevented from moving out into the wildernesses where the rich pastures afforded nourishment for their sheep. His only trouble was that any formal recognition of these \" squatters,\" as they then began to be called, implied Government protection, which would be expensive when men were so thinly scattered over so wide an area. He was at this very time confronted with a similar difficult)- in the south of what is now the colony of New South Wales. There, on what the)- called the Maneroo Plains, the sheep-owners were rapidly settling beyond the pale of government control, and Bourke had begun to see the necessity of forming a township at Twofold Bay, and of providing there the means of securing the proper administration of these pastoral regions. In October came the news that Fawkner and others were forming a settlement at Port Phillip, and from Arthur there arrived a letter stating that the association, in spite of the proclamation, were preparing to cross with their stock to the Dutigalla district. Arthur, whose interest in his nephew no doubt made him inclined to further to some extent the views of the association, gave an excellent character to its members, stating that they were a very respectable body of men, and in a pecuniary respect highly responsible. He explained that a considerable amount of capital was being invested, and commended the prudence and humanity of John Batman, with whom he was well acquainted. Moved by these representations, Governor Bourke, at the very time when Fawkner was in person joining the settlement on the Yarra, wrote to the Colonial Secretary in London recommending that in addition to Twofold Bay, Port Phillip should be selected as the site of a Government station. He forwarded all the journals, maps, and correspondence to the Colonial Office, and these appeared, as we have already seen, in the House of Commons reports nine months after. In his letter he mentions that he has thought it his duty to warn these people that as matters then stood the)- were simply trespassers, but he states that he proposes to take no"], [144, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 124 further action against them until he receives instructions from London. There is little doubt, he thinks, that Batman and his associates will continue to convey cattle and sheep to Port Phillip, and invest their capital there. Lie fears that without any properly constituted authority, while con vict shepherds are being brought over and scattered in lonely districts, it cannot but happen that a lawless and undesirable state of things will follow ; and therefore he would like to estab lish some sort of Governmental authority in the district. But if that is done he thinks the squatters themselves ought to defray the cost, by paying a small rent for their lands, and that allotments in a space to be marked out as a township should be sold in the ordinary way by auction. He would therefore express his dissent from the policy of the Colonial Office, which was to discourage the dispersion of the colonists ; he considered that no Government interference could prevent it. Had the development of affairs been guided by himself he would not yet have caused the Port Phillip district to be settled, but as the process is now going on and cannot well be stopped, he would recommend that a township be marked out in that istrict, and he has no doubt that purchases would immediately be made. The funds that would thus accrue ought in his opinion to be employed at first in the initiation of the settle ment in a regular and systematic way \u2014 in surveying the land, in paying the salaries of a police magistrate, of some constables, and of a customs officer. Eventually these funds might be employed in assisting the emigration of people from Europe, but provision ought to be made before that for the means of education, the land fund being employed in the erection and maintenance of undenominational schools of the kind then recently established in Ireland. In all this long and important despatch, the honest common sense of Sir Richard Bourke is fully manifested. It reads like the work of a gentleman, and by its kindly tone of sympathy with the colonists and their legitimate enterprises, renders plain to us the cause of that wholesome popularity which Bourke enjoyed in the colonies. Without knowing anything of this letter, which of course went direct to London, John Batman, a fortnight later, dated from Launceston a letter to Governor Arthur, requesting some provision for the maintenance of law and order at the new settlement. He states that the members of the association arc prepared to defray such portion of the necessary expense as the Government may think fair and reasonable; and that they are willing to pay that sum in addition to the quit-rent of about which they have already undertaken to pa)- to the natives. He informs the Governor that they have engaged two vessels for the transport of stock, and that before six months have elapsed, they expect to have sheep and cattle round Port Phillip to the value of twenty-five thousand pounds at least. Lie likewise relates the means that have been taken to improve the position of the natives, stating that from eighty to a hundred have been clothed and daily fed at the expense of the association, and also that when he and Mr. Wedge in a month or two, should cross to take up their permanent abode at Port Phillip, they would take with them a surgeon and catechist to attend to the aboriginals, both body and soul ; and that for this purpose they have already secured the services of Dr. Alexander Thomson. Arthur sent this request to his superior officer at Sydney, and Bourke placed it before his executive council, together with the letter he had addressed to Lord Glenelg, the Colonial Secretary, and the Council agreed with the Governor that he could not take any further action in the matter at present, he being as yet completely bound by the circular sent from the Colonial Office forbidding the dispersion of the colony. It was, of course, some months before any reply was received from London, and then it was not to Bourke, but to an earlier letter of"], [145, "JOHN PASCOE FAWKNER. -1833. 125 Arthur's. Lord Glenelg stated his regret that His Majesty's Government could not sanction the proceedings of Mr. Batman, and that while Governor Arthur's proposal to form a regular settlement at Port Phillip would receive every consideration, yet it was open to some ver)- serious objections. But the receipt of Sir Richard Bourke's letter seems to have altered Lord Glenelg's views; for, in a month or two, he wrote giving him permission to form the proposed township at Port Phillip, and to establish a local government of the kind he contemplated. He made no restrictions and offered no suggestions, relying on the discretion of Governor Bourke to carry out the necessary measures in a suitable way. Long before this permission was given, however, the association had resolved on making an ill-advised effort to maintain, by law, the validity of their purchase from the blacks. Major Mercer, one of their number, was about to proceed to Scotland to visit his friends, and to him was entrusted the duty of testing the legal value of their deed of grant. Towards the end of 1835 he reached England, and at once laid before four of the leading London barristers a case for their opinion. They were requested to state whether, as a matter of law, the Government had the power to expel them from lands as yet entirely in the occupation of savages; and also to explain what they thought the wisest course for the association to follow. Mr. Burgc, of Lincoln Inn, soon after stated his opinion in every point adversely to the claims of the association ; but recommended that it should apply to the Government, with a full statement of its case, for an indulgent treatment on account of its equitable and judicious treatment of the natives. This opinion, being submitted to Mr. Pemberton and Mr. Follett, was in all respects approved by them. Dr. Lushington then gave his opinion to precisely the same effect, and advised that the members of the association should approach the Government as memorialists, not relying on any claim they could set up, but desiring the co-operation of the State in their effort to institute a new* colon}-, and to benefit the natives of a waste territory. However, this recommendation was unnecessary, the association having already, through Governor Arthur, made some such request for indulgent treatment and for the sanction of the State in their purpose, and at the time when these legal opinions were being written, Lord Glenelg's polite refusal was being prepared and addressed from the Colonial Office to Lieutenant-Governor Arthur. Meanwhile the quiet little settlement among the gumtrecs of the Yarra was reaching the conclusion of 1835, all unconscious of the papers that were being drafted, corrected, copied, sealed, and transmitted about it and its future fate. As the Christmas time draws nigh, let us imagine we are taking a peep .it the nascent town. A ship is lying against the river-bank, the eighth that has visited the settlement since its inception; the trees at the landing-place have be\"en cut down, and the black soil on the water's edge trodden into a muddy consistency Behind the tree-fringed bank the slopes still rise in wooded gracefulness, but a few clear places can be noticed, and a stack or two of firewood, suggests the future fate of these venerable gums. Among the trees can be seen two houses, both of wood and both of small dimensions. The nearer one, a few hundred yards up the slope, is occupied by John Pascoc Fawkner, and displays a few bottles, a few glasses, and a barrel or two, for Fawkner is now the licensed publican of the place; and his wife dispenses the potations required in this December weather by the fist}- souls who constitute the settlement. Alas, Mr. Fawkner, this is not well! These squabbling blacks beyond the gully will possess themselves most assuredly of your fiery waters, and demoralisation then begins. Far other was the purpose of the association, who"], [146, "126 VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. stipulated that no sort of intoxicating liquor should be landed at Port Phillip, except for strictly medical purposes under proper prescription. However, it is now done; the dark man and the dark woman, are learning the mad excitement of what they are beginning to know as a \"\u25a0 big drunk.\" Less objectionable the few bags of flour and boxes of groceries that are to be seen around the house, for Fawkner is also general storekeeper for the settlement. Round his weatherboard cottage there stand some three or four huts of sods, roofed over with withered grass. There dwell the servants whom Fawkner brought over. If we climb the hill another two or three hundred yards, we are beside the weatherboard cottage, where Dr. Cotter resides when not superintending the operations of the association. He has by this time three stations to attend to; for Captain Swanston has landed something like a thousand sheep, and Mr. Connolly and Mr. Solomon have both sent over small flocks, which at present are situated near the site of Essendon under the charge of shepherds, while Mr. Wedge and Mr. Simpson have also sent over a few, which are nibbling the short sweet grass of Hotham, and the slopes leading down to Batman's swamp. Round Dr. Cotter's house there are half-a-dozen sod-built huts, occupied by Mr. Henry Batman and other employes of the association. Where we now stand on Batman's hill we can see the cultivated patch of Mr. Fawkner on the other side of the river, waving with yellow grain, or green with well-grown vegetables. Near it the formal lines are seen of the orchard he has planted. Over yonder, where now the St. Kilda road runs away to the south, a few sheep owned by Fawkner are ranging among the scrub. Half-a-dozen horses and some cattle wander up and down the slopes, which now are the streets of Melbourne; and such is the aspect of the town after it has been for three months the dwelling-place of Englishmen.

When the K\u00e6\u00a3&>f [\u00a9sea m^Si r\u00bbMJS beginning was fairly made, the influx of people was rapid and uninterrupted. BIot ' Ciovernor Arthur, in an official despatch from Tasmania, described the feeling \u2014 ' prevalent in that colony as a mania affecting all classes ; so strong was the desire to share in the potential riches which the new province opened out. If we, who look back on the matter with a cooler temper, and with all the wisdom left by two intervening generations, can scarcely see the grounds for so great an enthusiasm, let us remember that the experiment first started by John Macarthur thirty years before, had taken nearly all that time to fully justify itself; it was only within the last ten years that the owners of flocks had become conspicuously noted in the colonies for their prosperity. But at length Australia had taken its place as the most promising wool-growing country in the world ; and while wool continued high in price in England, it wanted nothing but the grassy plains such as Port Phillip offered to lead the settler on to fortune. Thus it happened that the land contemned by Collins and Grimes in 1803 was the source of boundless enthusiasm in 1836. These had looked only for a rich soil suited for cereals; while a later generation, with Macarthur's lesson duly learnt, looked on those widespread meadows of Port Phillip as little less than a golden harvest; seeing that with so little trouble it might be converted into bales of wool that would realise with ease their twenty pounds apiece in London. We know, alas, how many failed to reach that goal of competency. \\\\ e Vol. I. K"], [148, "128 VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. may look back over the vista of time, and see that two out of every three who sought the golden land either succumbed to their toils, or gave up the contest when the struggle of competition grew bitter, beyond their resources. But in 1836 and 1837 we have to chronicle the advent from week to week of bold hearts prepared to wrestle with fortune for the prize they hoped to bear away. The first party was that brought over by Mr. Gellibrand, the leading member of the Port Phillip Association ; it was he who with Batman had made application in 1827 for land at Western Port, and it was his support that Batman had especially sought in forming his association. The social position of Mr. Gellibrand at Hobart, his well-known character for fearless honesty, and his popularity with all classes, caused his connection with the association to lend it a dignity and standing that it could scarcely have commanded otherwise. He was, in fact, though not in any formal way, the chairman of the company. He did not intend to turn squatter himself, but there was his son Tom burning to carve out a path for himself, and the lad accompanied his father. In January, 1836, they sailed in the Norval, a barque of three hundred tons burthen, which for a year or two subsequently was devoted to the transport of sheep from Launceston to Port Phillip. Gellibrand took no sheep himself, as he only proposed on this trip to look at the land which had fallen to his lot on the shores of Corio Bay. And for the same purpose there sailed with him as passengers by the Norval William Robertson, one of the association, who afterwards settled at Western Port ; John Gardiner, who soon after formed a cattle station where Toorak now is ; Mr. Malcolm, who came over to select a station for Mr. John Sinclair, a member of the association, and soon had sheep running over the Indented Head Peninsula. There were on board over a thousand ewes and eighty four pure Saxon rams, belonging to Captain Swanston, the chairman of the Bank of Van Diemen's Land, but also a member of the association ; these being under the care of his manager, Mr. Mudie. Wild weather tossed the Norval up and down the straits for three days and nights, and in the heavy rolling 115 of the sheep were killed, and their carcases, worth over two pounds each, were thrown overboard. Unfortunately the hay, which had been taken on board in case their voyage might be protracted, was soaked with the seawater and rendered worthless, so that the sheep could not be kept long on board, and as the wind would not permit of their bearing up for Port Phillip at once, they ran into Western Port, and anchored about ten miles within the entrance. To save the sheep they were at once landed, among abundance of fine, sweet grass ; but no water could be found for them. As evening fell the poor creatures lay refusing to eat until they could first quench their raging thirst. Some shepherds were left to guard them, and the party turned in for the night, intending to start at daybreak in search of water. But in the morning not a sheep was to be seen. The shepherds, after their sea-sick tossing, had slept too soundly, and the sheep had disappeared in search of water. It was a hot day, but two thousand pounds worth of stock was not to be lightly lost, and the gentlemen set out to trace the sheep. After walking fifteen miles they returned at nightfall, having seen only two or three, in the agonies of death, who had failed to keep up with their fellows. The evening was a painful one. All were worn out with fatigue, and Mudie, who was responsible for the sheep, succumbed to a violent fit of hysterics. Late at night the news was brought that the shepherds had found 280 carcases lying in a muddy creek, to which the poor creatures had dragged themselves, and they seemed to have obtained tidings of the remainder. Gellibrand and the other passengers had now to choose whether to wait for the Norval to take them round to Port Phillip when the balance of Mr. Mudic's charge should be gathered, or to walk overland to the settlement' on the Yarra. The}- chose the latter course, rashly"], [149, "THE PIONEERS OF 1836. 129 thinking ,t would involve the least delay, and, each carrying a bottle of water, they started, eight in all, for what they imagined to be an easy little trip to the river Yarra They were carried across to the western shore of the port by one of the ship's boats, which, as ill- luck would have it, ran ashore on a sand bank, and the tide ebbing rapidly, they were left beyond all hope of lifting her off till return of tide. All night long they sat in sleepless d.scomfort till at six o'clock in the morning their boat floated, and they pushed on to the mainland. A breakfast on black swans revived them, and choosing John Gardiner as their guide they sallied forth into the bush.1 All were armed except Gellibrand, who was scarcely strong enough to bear the fatigue of a musket through a long march ; indeed, after nine miles the close heat of the bush on a hot day of January made him ill, and the party halted for the night, while he took some infallible pills of his. They were too hot to eat their dinner, and their heads were throbbing with the sun; and they went supperless to bed, each wrapping himself in his blanket and coiling himself up on the grass. In the morning, as their supplies of fresh water had been exhausted in the two previous days, and none was to be found where the)- were, they resumed their march without breakfast, and after a dreary walk reached the shores of Port Phillip near the present site of Dromana. There they found a small creek of fresh water, which revived them, and after a hearty meal they began their long walk round the bay to the Yarra. They trudged along all day, and camped towards sunset ; but a change had taken place in the weather, rain was falling. The)- made a blanket hut and crowded under it, while the torrents descended through the blackness of the midnight. Long before daylight they were glad to start again from the place where Frankston now is, and on they plodded till mid-day, when Tom Gellibrand and Mr. Leake lay down and said they could go no further. The}- were subsequently, however, induced to move up to a pool of brackish water, where they all dined and rested their weary limbs till four o'clock. Then they started again along the sands of Brighton and Elsternwick. A stack of wattle bark, somewhere near the present site of St. Kilda, warned them that they were nearing the settlement, but they could sec no habitation, and as night was upon them again they crowded with little comfort beneath the dripping shelter of their blanket roof. In the morning Mr. Gellibrand found his feet so badly blistered that after reaching the mouth of the Yarra he had to stop, while the others should go forward and procure a boat for him. Gardiner, Leake, Malcolm, and Tom Gellibrand went on, leaving the four others to wait in the tea-tree scrub. The)- had not long departed when a boat manned by the Sydney blacks passed down the river. They were on their way for a fishing excursion to the Heads, but at Gellibrand's request they took the part)- aboard and turned back for the settlement. The dozen huts on the Yarra bank now seemed like civilisation, and they had a plea sant spell in which to recruit. Gellibrand had long chats with the big and indolent Buckle}-, in which he strove to pump out of that uncommunicative authority all that could be gleaned about the natives, their ways, their numbers, their sentiments. He was not unmindful of the unfortunate Mudie and his flock round in Western Port, and was preparing to send round some help to save the property of his friend Captain Swanston. But the Enterprise, that had just entered the bay after calling at Western Port, brought the news that Mudie's troubles were over. He had succeeded in gathering only seventy-eight of the great flock entrusted to his care, the rest having died from thirst or having been speared by the blacks. In the midst of his distress and distraction, while he was re-embarking that sorry remnant, the rough weather upset the boat Mr. Gellibrand's diary is printed in the Transactions of the Royal Society of Victoria."], [150, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 130 that carried him, and he and two of the sailors were drowned. The seventy-eight surviving sheep were taken to Port Phillip in the Enterprise. After a rest Mr. Gellibrand took Buckley as a guide and started with Gardiner, Robertson, and Dr. Cotter, the association's manager, to look at section twelve of the Batman grant, which had fallen to the lot of Gellibrand. They record their delight with the scenery they saw in passing over what is now Essendon, and describe the view at the ford over the Saltwater as quite enchanting. On the third da}- the}- were on the tract of land the}- wished to view. It la}- round the You Yang Hills, and though drearily bare of timber was clearly a fine sheep district. Then on they went to the head of Geelong Harbour, none of them being now troubled as in the previous travelling, each having a good horse to ride. The}- reached the Barwon, where Buckley's former tribe received him with the liveliest joy and hung round him with expressions of warm affection. They viewed the horses with singular respect, and Mr. Gellibrand amused them by giving them their first experience of riding on horseback. Some took it without alarm, but a maiden of thirteen, when she felt the horse first move beneath her, could not imitate their semblance of indifference. Round the Barrabool Hills Mr. Gellibrand found what he describes as the finest country he had ever seen. He was equally pleased with Captain Swanston's station, and indeed with all the blocks which he examined on his way back from the Geelong district to the Saltwater. Thence he turned north to examine the country round the present town of Sunbury, and on his way back held well to the east so as to cross the land that had fallen to the share of Governor Arthur's nephew. In this detour the party at mid-da}- reached a full flowing creek, whose ample volume made their dinner less thirsty than it would have been on an}- of the dried-up creeks they had recently passed. It was from this circumstance that the pretty stream derived its name of the Plenty River. After a fortnight's travelling they reached once more the little settlement, where Gellibrand was distressed to hear that the natives were clamorous on account of an outrage committed by one of the association's shepherds stationed on the Keilor plains. It was clearly proven that the man had enticed a native woman into his hut ; had tied her up, and kept her so throughout the night ; that in the morning he had violated her person and dismissed her for fear of the vengeance of her friends. The man, to save his life, had returned to the settlement, and there the blacks accused him. His defence was lame, and there was no doubt that he was a low miscreant. No adequate punishment could be meted out to him, but he was kept till the next vessel sailed for Tasmania and deported back to that island. When this was explained to the blacks, they expressed their satisfaction with the penalty; and so the worthy Gellibrand, when he soon after himself returned to that island, could carry with him the reflection that his kindliness and tact had set a lesson to other white men who respected him and might be ver)- much inclined to imitate his actions. On reaching Launceston, Mr. Gellibrand hurried forward the shipments of his sheep, and in a month or so had 2500 sheep on the Werribee Plains, under the management of Dr. Clarke, about the mouth of the Little River. But meantime others also were hurrying sheep across as fast as the limited supply of vessels would permit. The Norval and Caledonia, each brigs of 300 tons burden ; the Chili, of 200, and the Henry, of 150, with several schooners \u2014 the Adelaide, the Champion, the Hetty, the Vansittart, all of about 100 tons ; the Gem, the Edward, and the Enterprise, of smaller size, made trip after trip during the first six months of 1836, amounting to a total of forty eight trips, in which they carried ver)' nearly 20,000 sheep. John Aitkcn, who had in the previous September followed the course of the Enterprise when she was bringing John Pawkner and his household over, now returned in March in the"], [151, "THE PIONEERS OF 1836. 131 Chili, which he had chartered to convey 600 sheep, the nucleus of a flock' afterwards famous. The Chili, in ascending Port Phillip by the South Channel, grounded opposite Arthur's Seat, and as it was at first impossible to get her off the sheep were laboriously landed in the ship's boats, the natives giving cheerful and unasked assistance ; the operation terminated without the slightest accident or collision, and then commenced the slow progress of the flock over unknown country, across the Yarra at the safest ford they could find, and so up to the district about the present site of Sunbury, where a station was formed at a hill since then known as Mt. Aitken. There in unobtrusive quietness John Aitken spent the bark-hut period of a squatter's life, toiling over the hot plains by day, folding his sheep at night, and retiring at sunset to his supper of damper and mutton and tea, and lodging on the floor within the seamy walls He prospered in six or eight years into the period of the sylvan cottage, with its vines, its orchard, and its flower-garden, and so, unmoved by troubles, taking to himself a wife and gathering ease and comfort round himself, he became a magnate in the land. Not so his friend Charles Franks. His hopes were destined to no fruition. In May of 1836, Franks and George Armytage crossed from Tasmania with a small flock of ewes, and landed at Williamstown. Finding great quantities of sheep running over the scrubby lands, which are now suburban allotments, waiting till their owners could decide as to their future locations, Armytage returned to Tasmania to send over more sheep, while Franks should find a suitable run. The latter, accompanied by a shepherd, drove their little flock across the plains till he reached the Werribee, and there decided to fix his abode. The two men were engaged in enclosing a piece of ground with a bush fence, to serve as a sheepfold, when the natives, who had been watching their operations, stole craftily up behind ; one blow of a tomahawk on the head of each left them dead on the spot with their skulls split open. Their sheep were driven away, and there, on the open plains, lay the two bodies staring up to heaven, while several days came and went till passers chanced to notice them. Their remains were carried into the little settlement beside the Yarra, and, followed by the whole population in procession, were taken to that spot in what is now the Flagstaff Gardens, where a simple monument still marks their resting-place among the shad)' willows ; one other body had already been consigned to that primitive cemetery, that of a little child, the first that died in Melbourne. Some of the natives, who were now always hanging about the settlement, often a hundred at a time, eagerly accepted the chance of gratifying their tribal hatreds, and securing the kidney fats of some of their fellow-natives. With these as guides and allies, some white men sallied forth on a mission of vengeance. The details of the expedition are not known, but some of the blacks were shot, and the avenging party returned with the arms and property of the murdered men. But the throng of settlers that poured into the country accepted such dangers with equanimity, and the scrubby shores of Williamstown, which was the favourite landing place, were crowded with sheep that arrived more rapidly than they could be provided for. Cowie and Stead had driven their flocks from that landing place down to Geelong harbour, and chosen a station round a little hill, whereon the)' erected a post with a ship's bell swung upon it so that at the sound of its tolling all the shepherds might gather from out the lonely plains, if danger should threaten from the blacks. Near this hill, called Bell Post Hill, Mr. Robert Steiglitz, who soon after followed them, formed the second of the Geelong stations. In March the Caledonia landed the representatives of two new companies that had been formed in Tasmania. The Clyde Company sent Mr. George Russell, and the Derwent Company Mr."], [152, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 132 David Fisher, to select stations for their flocks. Another passenger by the Caledonia was Dr. Alexander Thomson, who had been sent as medical officer and catechist by the Association. They were carried up the Yarra and strove to get accommodation at Fawkner's rude hotel; but the place was already crowded. They therefore occupied tents on the river bank, while Thomson, who had with him his wife and family, proceeded to build for himself a house of slabs. Russell went out to inspect the land that was allotted to Swanston and Mercer, while Fisher, who had already sent over some sheep before him, went down to the Geelong district to see what sort of land had been chosen there. He spent a day with Cowie and Stead on the Barwon, and proceeded to Indented Head, where his men had taken up their quarters. Two of them were recently missing, and it had been discovered that while TTACK BY NATIVE travelling down from the landing place at Williamstown with a dray load of provisions they had been massacred by the blacks. These natives had been supposed to be friendly, and some of them invited one of the shepherds to move a little distance away from his fellow in order to shoot a supposed kangaroo. When the two white men were thus parted, the one who had gone into the scrub to shoot was suddenly transfixed by a spear, and fell, to be pitilessly brained by the savages. The other man had placed his gun in the dray to avoid the trouble of carrying it; but now could be seen the folly of blindly trustino- the natives. He was separated from his weapon, at once surrounded, and could do nothing but submit to his fate. The horse was speared, and the dray load of provisions appropriated by the blacks. This story was told to Fisher, but nothing could be done in the matter without the risk of stirring up a general conflict. It is true that some of the native tribes offered to secure the murderers and give them up to justice, but as there were then no leo-al tribunals in the country, and the white men were not prepared to take the responsibility of shooting the murderers if captured, the matter was allowed to rest for the time. Fisher, on his way back to the Yarra, camped one night on the grassy slope where now the broad streets of Geelon\"- run upward from Corio Bay. He noted the beaut)' of the spot and seems to have"], [153, "THE PIONEERS OF 1836. 133 remembered it well, for when he returned with sheep he chose it for his headquarters, and early in 1837 fixed the site of the future city by building his house close by the Barwon slope\u2014 the first house of Geelong. He came as the manager of what was known as the Derwent Company consisting of Captain Swanston, Major Mercer, and Mr. Thomas Learmonth. The next trip of the Caledonia brought over John Batman with his family to form their permanent residence by the Yarra. Batman's brother, Henry, during these past nine months had been taking charge of his interests while he himself was selling off his place in Tasmania and winding up his affairs. He brought with him his wife, seven daughters, and their governess, Miss Newcome, and reached the settlement at the end of April. He had carried over the materials for a weatherboard cottage of two or three rooms, and this he erected on the hill behind his brother's hut, and some little distance above Fawkner's Hotel. There he enclosed ground for a garden and planted a thousand THOMAS LEARMONTH fruit trees which he had brought with him. His servants were now increased to thirty in number, and a few more turf huts were put up for their accommodation. Along with him in the Caledonia came Mr. James Simpson, another member of the Port Phillip Association, and the Rev. Mr. Orton, a Wesleyan clergyman, who took a trip over to see the new settlement. Dr. Thomson had for a few Sundays read the Church of England service in his tent to such as chose to attend, but now, on the first Sunday of May, advantage was taken of the presence of a clergyman to hold the first public service on Victorian soil. A few rude seats beneath the she-oaks upon Batman's Hill provided accommodation for this primitive congregation, which was enlivened by the presence of the ten Sydney natives, all in red shirts and snowy pantaloons, save one, who wore a cast-off uniform of Colonel Arthur's, surmounted by a cocked hat, nodding with a plume of feathers. The Church of England service was read, Mr. Simpson giving the responses, and then Dr. Thomson led off the first hymn that ever swelled its rude but earnest unison up from the site of Melbourne. Another circumstance that marked the establishment of civilisation on these haunts of the savage was the preparation made for the dispensing of a sort of justice. A dispute had arisen between Fawkner and Henry Batman about some petty matters, the destruction of some rabbits belonging to Fawkner by Batman's men, the worrying of one of Fawkner's calves by Batman's kangaroo dogs, and so on. Mr. James Simpson had been asked to act as arbitrator in this case only a day or two after his landing, and had nominated Dr. Thomson and Mr. John Aitken as his colleagues in that important office. They had awarded damages to Fawkner to the extent of \u00a32 15s., and had complimented him upon the forbearance he had shown.'\"' The success of this first arbitration had led the settlers to wish for some such arrangement as a recognised institution of the place until the time might arrive when a properly appointed magistrate should enforce the law among them. Hence came the first public meeting of the colony's history. The sixteen squatters then in the settlement met, and voted Mr. Simpson to the chair.3 The first resolution, which was carried unanimously, appointed Mr. Simpson the arbitrator for the settlement, he being permitted to choose two assistants for himself; the second gave him power to inflict any sine he thought proper.

The last directed the preparation of a petition to Governor Bourke. asking him to appoint a resident magistrate for the Port Phillip District. The agreements arrived at by this meeting were subsequently submitted to thirty-one men of the settlement, and signed by them, in token of their acquiescence with the substance of them ; and so Mr. James Simpson was, for the time being, the judge of the little community. But they were nearer the attainment of duly constituted authority than they had perhaps expected. At this very meeting there was present an officer sent by Governor Bourke to report on the condition of affairs at Port Phillip. The Governor, whose proclamation of nine months before had been a mere compliance with orders, and had in no way represented his own sentiments, no sooner heard that quite a movement was on foot for the occupation of these southern shores and that over 15,000 sheep had been landed, than he resolved to get more definite information before deciding what steps ought next to be taken. On the 4th of May he directed Mr. George Stewart, the police magistrate of the Goulburn district, to proceed to Port Phillip for this purpose, and two days later that gentleman sailed from Port Jackson in the Government cutter Prince George. A tedious voyage of nearly three weeks had brought him to Indented Head on the 25th of Ma}', and there he was met by Mr. Wedge, who escorted him up to the settlement, then known under the name of Bearbrass, or Bearpurt, an attempt to reproduce some native name supposcel to indicate the locality.' He found the township to consist of three weatherboard houses anel ten huts, two of them built of slabs and the rest of sods. But the population of the district amounted to 142 males 35 females. Nine of the members of the Port Phillip Association were in the colony, but only four of them were as yet on their land, the other five having only recently arrived, and being on their way to their stations. Twenty-four other stock proprietors, unconnected with Batman's enterprise, had taken up land on their own account ; and in all there were, so far as Stewart could learn, some twenty-six thousand sheep in the settlement, and these, with a few cattle, horses, and the farming implements that had been brought over, represented a total value of about .\u00a380,000. On his arrival at the settlement, Mr. Stewart announced to the natives that he had brought a supply of blankets for them from the Governor at Sydney. He gave them two or three days to gather for the distribution, but then was surprised at the small muster. He learnt, however, that there were not so many as eight hundred altogether in the district, and that the largest number ever assembled did not exceed four hundred. He dealt out the blankets to those who came, and doubtless suggested to them the impropriety of wandering in future about the streets of a town in that easy simplicity which might formerly be forgiven them, but now must be laid aside when they had blankets with which to clothe themselves. It was on the same day, the 1st of June, that the settlers held their first meeting, when Mr. Simpson was appointed arbitrator. Stewart was there, and no doubt was expected to take note of the last resolution, \" That a petition be prepared to Governor Bourke, praying him to appoint a resident magistrate at Port Phillip.\" Two days later he sailed for Sydney, which he reached in a week, and there prepared his report, in which he gave full particulars of the settlement, and described the settlers themselves as men of a superior class, who were, in the first place, taking ever)' possible care that no wrong should be done to the natives ; anel, in 1 The particulars of Mr. Stewart's visit are best gathered from his own report made lo Governor Bourke.

In regard to the blacks, it is stated that the Port Phillip residents showed them great kindness ; that they had withheld from them the knowledge of tobacco and strong drink, and were endeavouring to teach them civilised habits. As to the convicts, the new settlement wished to have nothing to do with them, and one or two who had smuggled themselves over in the Caledonia were being watched for, in order that if they presented themselves at the township they might be at once returned to Tasmania. Everything in this report was in favour of the settlers, and Bourke was informed that they were much gratified that he had caused an inquiry to be made into their condition, and that they would be greatly pleased if he could see his way to afford them the protection of his government. Nothing would have pleased the Governor more than to have complied at once with this prayer, but to have done so would have been to ignore the express wish of the Colonial Office. He had, therefore, to wait patiently for the receipt of a reply to his letter of the preceding October. That reply \u2014 to which we have already referred \u2014 was now on its way, Lord Glenelg having on the 13th of April sent instructions to Bourke to make no attempt for the repression of this laudable spirit of enterprise in which the new settlement was finding its origin, and implicitly giving him permission to do as he thought fit. Lord Glenelg's letter did not arrive till nearly two months after the receipt of Stewart's report; but, without delay, Bourke proceeded to act upon it. His Majesty's ship Rattlesnake was then lying in Port Jackson under the command of Captain Hobson. He was directed to hold his vessel ready for an immediate departure to Port Phillip in order to land there a government part)-. On the 9th of September a Gazette notice was prepared, stating that the Governor had been pleased to appoint Captain William Lonsdale, of the Fourth or King's Own Regiment, to be police magistrate for the Port Phillip district. This same Gazette notice intimated that land in that district would be thrown open for sale by auction, in accordance with the terms then customary. Bourke, being now free to act in regard to the disposal of these waste lands, was not forgetful of Batman and his claims, and sent a message by the Rattlesnake in which he invited the Port Phillip Association to send a deputation to Sydney, in order to lay their claims before the council there, and to discuss the terms on which they might be allowed to retain a small portion of the land they desired to possess.5 CAPTAIN WILLIAM LONSDALE. To maintain order in the district, Lieutenant King was sent with a force of thirty soldiers. A small staff of officers was appointed, consisting of three assistant surveyors (Robert Russell, F. D'Arcy, and W. Darkc) whose duty it should be to survey the town and prepare the plans that would be necessary before sales of land could take place. Mr. R. S. Webbe was to go as officer of customs, and J. M'Namara as his tide waiter. A district constable and two ordinary constables completed the equipment necessary for the new government, and, considering all the circumstances, it must be admitted to have been ample. Great was the delight in the settlement when on the ist of October, 1836, the Rattlesnake arrived at the mouth of the Yarra, and Captain Hobson escorted Captain Lonsdale up the river Bourke's report to Lord Glenelg, printed in Labillicre II., 143.

For a week or two Lonsdale accepted the hospitality of John Batman up on the hill, but as Mrs. Lonsdale was expected to follow him from Sydney very shortly, and the Captain would doubtless be better pleased with a dwelling of his own, a turf hut was commenced a little lower down, where now stands the Savings Bank. Many hands made quick work, and the dingy little place was soon prepared as the first Government House. There the lady soon after commenced her open-air housekeeping, and there was established the majesty of the law, though for some time public business continued to be transacted at Batman's store. Hobson had been directed by Governor Bourke to remain at the settlement for a time lest his services might be required, and he occupied the interval in carefully charting the entrance to the river and the bay into which it discharges its waters. To that bay the Governor subsequently assigned the name of Hobson's Bay, in honour of the worthy captain. Two other names are said to have been given during the subsequent exploration of the south channel of the port ; Mount Commandant's House, Melbourne. From the original sketch, by Captain (afterwards Admiral) P. P. King, R.N., dated March 1837. a Batman \u2014 Mount Macedon in the distance. b Captain Hobson, H. M.S.

Martha commemorates the name of Mrs. Lonsdale, Mount Eliza that of Mrs. Batman ; these being the influential ladies of the settlement.\" Before the Rattlesnake sailed on her return, a dinner was given by the settlers in honour of Captain Hobson. Lonsdale was there, and it was a festive affair, and the ladies graced it with their presence ; it began at the early hour of four o'clock, and terminated at six, the illuminating capacities of the settlement being doubtless insufficient for an evening entertainment. The company sat down to a \" splendid leg of mutton, a very fine shoulder of mutton, stewed mutton chops, real Irish pork, pig's cheek, and a variety of other delicacies.\" They had a dessert ; then came wine and toasts, and so passed off the first public dinner upon Victorian soil.' There had been, however, in the meantime, two meetings of a sterner character wherein business was both meant and transacted. Lonsdale had brought with him the news that land in the settlement was to be put up for auction, and this had gratified the residents ; 6 Gurner, p. 30. : Bonwick's Port Thillip Settlement, p. 424."], [157, "THE PIONEERS OF 1836. 137 but when they sound it taken for granted that the sale must take place in Sydney, iheir satisfaction was much diminished. There was not a Sydney resident in all their number; they were all Tasmanians, and to have to sacrifice a month or two, and a sum which they estimated at about \u00a390, in proceeding to Sydney in order to purchase perhaps a single allotment, worth only \u00a3\\o or \u00a320, seemed to them an undoubted hardship, more especially as it was not supposed that any one then in Sydney was likely to feel an interest in the place or to become a purchaser of its land. Hence, in less than a week after Lonsdale's arrival, they held their meeting and entered their protest. Before the departure of the Rattlesnake they held their second meeting, and had their petition drawn for presentation to Governor Bourke, who subsequently complied with their desires, to the extent of directing that the first two land sales should be held at the settlement itself. About the same time the deputation departed for Sydney to lay before the Government there the case of the Port Phillip Association. Mr. James Simpson, Captain Swanston, and Mr. Gellibrand were the three chosen for the purpose. These gentlemen appeared before the Executive Council of New South Wales, and stated that while they did not imagine themselves to have any legal claim to the possession of the land ceded to John Batman by the natives, yet they thought that in equity some consideration should be shown them as the pioneers in opening up a valuable province. They had spent money freely in transferring stock to the settlement, and eleven of their number, namely, Swanston, Gellibrand, Simpson, Waite, Connolly, Arthur, Sams, Sinclair, Batman, Solomon, and Cotterell, had now 13,600 sheep round Port Phillip, a fact which indicated their intention of properly utilising the land. They had treated the natives with studious consideration, and were prepared to pay them in goods a rental equivalent to Z'Soo a-year ; and in addition to that, they would contribute two or three thousand pounds annually towards the expense of governing the district, if they were confirmed in the possession of the land they held. The association might have succeeded in securing, not by any means what they asked for, but at any rate very favourable terms, had there not been at their heels two other deputations representing those who had transferred their stock to Port Phillip and occupied the country there without belonging to the association. Mr. John Dobson, a solicitor of Hobart, appeared on behalf of forty-three proprietors to protest against the claim made by the association to the possession of all that choice pastoral area of nearly a million acres, which they desired to monopolise. It was of course plain that if the association carried its point, all the land on the western side of Port Phillip, from the Yarra to the Barwon, and running up to the foot of the mountains, must be locked against all others, and it was well enough known that the eastern side of the port was very much less suitable; while as to the inland country very little could as yet be said of its capabilities. Major Mitchell, the explorer who was destined to give it celebrity under the title of Australia Felix, was even then only on his way homeward, and on the very day whilst Dobson was being examined, Mitchell was re-crossing the river Murray with his advanced party. Nothing, therefore, was known of the inland districts. The western shores of Port Phillip were the plains of rich dry grass that had attracted the sheepovvners, and it was there they all wished to choose their runs. Mr. Dobson explained that these settlers had all had equal opportunities of purchasing land from the natives, but that their desire not to infringe upon the rights of the Crown had restrained them. In conclusion Mr. Dobson urged upon the Executive Council, that whatever indulgence was granted to the association should be also granted to them. For they were to the same extent pioneers,"], [158, "138 VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. most of them having landed in the settlement before the members of the association themselves took up their residence there, and the}' had carried over stock to a still greater extent than the association. There was yet a third claim to be discussed by the Council. Seven other settlers \u2014 William J. T. Clarke, afterwards so well-known in the colony, R. Lewis, George T. Lloyd, Robert Sutherland, Joseph Sutherland, William Carter, and George White \u2014 sent in a memorial on their own behalf, stating that they also were occupiers of land at Port Phillip ; and expected to be placed on the same sooting as the members of the association. A week later the council met to deliberate on these applications, and drew up a long and careful decision. This document' sets forth that the association can make no pretence to the discovery of Port Phillip or even of the Yarra ; that its members are exactly on the same footing as any of the other adventurous squatters who were daily pushing out on all sides into the unoccupied wilderness ; that arrangements are being made by which, on the payment of a small fee for an annual license, these settlers might be permitted to occupy as tenants such lands as they wished for their sheep, but that to regard the purchase made by Batman from the natives as in an)- way valid would be to completely upset all the land regulations of the country. The council moreover pointed out that the association had transferred its stock and incurred its great expense in deliberate defiance of the Governor's proclamation of 26th August 1835, so that it could claim no indulgence from Government on the ground of its expenditure. But on the other hand the council thought it right to recognise the claims of the association to compensation for that part of its outlay which had taken place before the issue of the proclamation ; and the elelegatcs were asked to draw up a schedule of their expenditure up to 26th August 1835, including the value of property given to natives, and the cost of the preliminary trips of Batman and Wedge. The council decided that when, in the usual way, the land at Port Phillip should be put up to auction at a minimum rate of five shillings an acre, there should be deducted from the sum payable by the association, such an amount as would cover these expenses. As for the other claimants who had appeared at Port Phillip long after the Governor's proclamation was well known, the council decided that no indulgence whatever could be granted them. Swanston, Gellibrand, and Simpson made an unavailing attempt to secure better terms, but at the same time forwarded the list of expenses demanded by the council. These expenses were set forth with no niggardly hand, and ran up to the considerable sum of \u00a37000, which the council on the 1st of November ordered to be deducted from the purchase-money of any lands subsequently purchased by members of the association. Major Mercer in Edinburgh made a prolonged effort, lasting through several years, to induce the Colonial Office to reverse this decision. But Governor Bourke had in the meantime written informing Lord Glenelg that the association had put up no buildings on the land, and made no improvements on it that were more than nominal. lie stated that the list of expenses set forth by the association as having been incurred by them previous to the proclamation had been allowed by the council without any rigid scrutiny, and that the association had reason to be satisfied with the terms allowed them. He accordingly desired Lord Glenel\"- to approve and maintain the decision of the council, and that minister gave no encouragement to Mercer to continue his agitation, so that the matter was in the end settled as the Sydney council had determined. 8 Printed in full, Labilliere II., 221."], [159, "THE PIONEERS OF 1S36. 139 In the meantime, throughout all the year 1836, the stream of arrivals at Port Phillip had been without interruption. In April a new landing place for stock was added to that at Point Gellibrand, which had so long been the favourite. Sheep which were landed there, if intended for the Geelong district, had a long journey before them through land already occupied before the)- could reach their stations, and Captain Pollock in the Francis Freeling was the first to feel his way cautiously up Corio Bay, and use Point Henry, close to Geelong, as a place for landing sheep. The first shipment is said' to have been unfortunate. The sheep were the property of Mr. Joseph Sutherland, who accompanied them, with the intention of forming a station on the Barwon. Four hundred of them in their thirst rushed into the salt water and drank of it freely; most of these soon after died, and the remaining four hundred were carried off by the blacks. It was not until after a long chase that a part of them were recovered. But in spite of this mishap Point Henry was a chosen place for the landing of sheep intended for the Western district. In that district there were towards the close of 1S36, not only Cowie, Stead, and Robert Steiglitz, who had settled on the Barwon nearly a year before, but also Dr. Thomson, who besides holding his position as surgeon and catechist to the association, was occupying by means of shepherds a small station near what were called Buckley's Falls on the Barwon.'0 In July arrived Thomas Manifold, along with his brothers John and Peter ; they landed their stock at Point Henry, where on the same day John Steiglitz also landed his; and they all settled along the course of the Barwon. Mr. Wm. Roadknight followed them, and Mr. J. C. Darke, who pushed a little way out on the Barrabool hills. In September 1836 quite a rush of stock took place to the Geelong district, when Mr. Joseph Sutherland returned with his brother and a second large shipment of sheep; they took up a station on the creek which bears their name, a tributary of the Barwon. Then came George Russell as manager of the Clyde Company, who occupied the land on the Moorabool and Leigh Rivers between Geelong and Mt. Buninyong; and Henry Anderson and John Brown and Captain Pollock all settled on the Barwon and Sutherland's Creek; J. N. Macleod, and G. F. Read on the upper part of the Moorabool ; Daviel Fisher, on behalf of the Derwent Company, occupied all the peninsula from Ouecnscliff to Geelong, and William Sharp, on behalf of Colonel Kclsall, ran a flock of sheep over the district watered by the upper part of Sutherland's Creek; others followed, till at the close of 1S36 all the land for a distance of twenty-five miles on each side of Geelong was occupied by squatters, their shepherds and their sheep. The majority of these settlers were gentlemen of good birth and ample education ; but disinclined for the routine of conventional life, and much preferring the fine fresh feeling \u2014 the freedom, the sense of adventure that attended the squatter's life. LTp with the sun in the morning, the cheerful breakfast quickly over, rough, but always enjoyed, they soon were on horseback, and as they generally indulged themselves in animals of a spirited class, the feeling of scouring these grassy plains with a freely striding steed beneath them was of 0 Gurner, p. 28. 10 The adventures of these pioneers and the order of their landing are in the main drawn from the work entitled \"Letters from Victorian Pioneers.\" When Governor Latrobe, in 1S53, was about to leave the colony, he desired to place on record the story of the settlement of the lands of Victoria. He therefore sent a circular letter to the pioneers, and received some sixty answers, which he took with him to England; he made no use of them, however, and they were returned to the colony, where they were for years kept in the cellars of the Public Library. A year or so before his death Sir Redmond Barry called attention to their value; a committee examined them carefully; some were found to be wanting, but how lost it is impossible to say. The remaining letters, fifty-three in number, have been published by the trustees of the Public Library."], [160, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 140 itself a charm that dispelled all lingering care. Even when the hot wind blew with languid breath over the plains, those riders who rounded up the sheep, or gathered them into their fold, or galloped out after the straggling wethers, were cool on horseback in their slight attire. And when the long day's work was over, beneath the exhilarating lightness of an Australian sky, they returned, to no home of luxury perhaps, but certainly to a well-earned rest, and to those unconventional ways that form a fascination for young people in all ages and all countries. The billy was swung over the ample fire, and the greasy chops were fried. The big tin pannikins of tea were steaming on the table rudely built of slabs, and by it was the great damper from which they broke or cut with their jack-knives big lumps to be eaten with the swimming chops. Then on a rude form or two, made of a few slabs, roughly nailed together, they sat and talked and ate their meal with the ease and leisure of men who had nothing in the world to hurry them or worry them. As darkness steals on they gather in the twilight with glowing pipes, and a long, slow, argumentative smoke carries them to the hour for bed. For bed, but not for sleep. They light up their lamp, a pannikin filled with mutton fat with a wick of cotton, and one of them gets out the book or the scrap of newspaper ; each coils himself up on his blanket, and wraps around him his rug upon the floor, and so while each reads in turn the evening quickly passes. Or if their half-dozen books be voted I too well-known and too often read, and is no recent papers less than three or four months old be available, they fall back upon the inexhaustible \" yarn.\" Each tells his adventures, or touches up and im- proves upon the adventures of others. General talk, prolonged discussions follow, or perhaps with some apologies to conscience they indulge in the forbidden luxury of a final smoke in bed, and then at last to sleep, while through the cracks in the roof or the mud-beplastered walls the stars move overhead, and the breezes enter to sweeten their bedroom of tobacco smoke and the cooking odours of tlie day. Then with the mornin\u00b0- came again the open air, the broad plains and the gallop at full career. It was a life as rough and rude as it was free and glorious ; but many of those pioneers in the after days of affluence looked back with regret on the times when the world was so light and frolicsome. The visitor who travelled up from Geelong to the Yarra at the end of 1836 sound all the plains on the road thus occupied by the light-hearted pioneers; their huts and their hurdles in which the sheep were enclosed at nightfall dotted the plains at intervals. Dr. Clarke was"], [161, "THE PIONEERS OF 1S36. 141 there by the You Yangs managing the sheep of Mr. Gellibrand. John Helder Wedge had a station on the Werribce, then often called by settlers the Exe, and near him the flocks of James Simpson cropped the grass over the eastern side of that river. During the absence of Simpson his station was managed for him by Wedge, who was subsequently joined by his nephew from Tasmania. A mean-looking little hut beside a few stunted bushes, the only ones that broke the treeless plains for a mile or two, was for a long time the head-quarters of that station, from which in after years so much of wealth has been derived. Mr. Solomon and Mr. Cotterell had their flocks on the banks of the Saltwater. The companions of Fawkner in his first enterprise, , those earliest occupants of Melbourne, George Evans and Samuel and William Jackson, were at Sunbury, on the banks of Jackson's Creek, which took its name from the two latter of these squatters. John Aitken was their neighbour to the west, and to the north, a mile or two beyond the present site of Sunbury, three brothers of the name of Brock \u2014 Henry, Alexander, and James \u2014 were settled with the sheep which they had imported in June from Tasmania. On the whole there must have been, inclusive of the Henty family, quietly pursuing their own way at Portland, some hundred or more of sheep proprietors in the colony at the end of 1836, all taking up land without any license, but in expectation of arrangements in ths future by which they would be permitted to become Crown tenants on payment of a yearly fee. Their position would generally have been one of danger, situated so far in the wilderness, if there had not been so good an understanding maintained on the banks of the Yarra between the new-comers and the natives. And the squatters of these early days uniformly treated the aboriginals with kindness, even though their shepherds were sometimes more or less brutal. In after years reckless men caused mischief \u2014 wild spirits from the old country \u2014 but as a rule the pioneers of 1836 were en friendly terms with the tribes of their neighbourhood, although they well knew the folly of trusting too implicitly to kindness alone, and were generally carefully on their guard. Their life though in its way adventurous, had few excitements, the chief being the annual shearing, when, what with the securing of a few extra hands, and the placating of these men with rum, without which they would not work ; what with the washing of the sheep, the shearino*, the pressing of the wool into bales and getting it prepared for the market, a few weeks passed in a manner that formed a break to the usual routine. The first shearing effected in the colony is said tc have taken place near the Flemington Racecourse. The sheep belonged to an association consisting of Thomas Winter, Charles McLachlan, John Dobson, and James Clarke, of whom none were in the colony, but they had sent Mr. Kenneth Clarke as their manager. The brig Henry had required three trips to bring over their flocks, and by the time the sheep had moved up from Point Gellibrand to the Saltwater River the season for shearing was at hand. Accordingly eighteen days were spent in the operation, and then the sheep were driven up to what is now called Bacchus Marsh from its next occupant, two years later, named Captain Bacchus.\" Batman had at this time about two thousand sheep running over the grassy parks of Carlton and West Melbourne, and out to the site of Brunswick. Whilst the land was thus being occupied, the little township on the Yarra was certain to increase, and its three stores began to do a good business in supplying all the squatters with their various necessaries. Batman had his little schooner, the Gem, constantly plying to \" Labilliere II., 114"], [162, "142 VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. and fro between Port Phillip and Launceston, while Fawkner kept the Enterprise busy in the same way. There were over 300 persons in the district, and of these nearly a hundred were dwellers in the township, which still however presented a most temporary appearance. The land had, however, been fairly well cleared; the densely wooded gully of Elizabeth-street was stripped of its foliage for a quarter or half of a mile up the slope, and the rising ground on the west, leading up to the huts upon the hill, was mostly denuded of timber, and lay a broad paddock with the stumps of trees dotting the trampled grass. Amidst this clearing in the great forest, showing itself half way up the slope, stood the humble hut of Captain Lonsdale. Behind it there was a second sod hut, low in the roof and without a window. This was the lock-up of the settlement, an establishment of that sort being a necessary consequence on the presence of three policemen, the chief of whom, poor old Hooson, was long an institution of the town. He had been a soldier, and having been severely wounded in the head, was eccentric enough to be the source of much harmless amusement in the early settlement. His fussy interference with the natives, seeing that he had little else to do, was probably meant as an honest effort to earn his three shillings a day and rations of salt beef or pork; for there was little or nothing to be done, and it was quite a triumph for the three policemen when Fawkner's rum proved too much for a shearer or shepherd, and he had to be escorted in state to the lock-up. Fawkner was busy adding a couple of wooden rooms to his hotel, and Mr. Strachan had just erected a little wooden box of a house close to Captain Lonsdale's place, where Market Buildings now stand. There was one improvement then going on. It had been discovered that Buckley had been in youth a bricklayer, and his early training was now utilised by setting him to build chimneys for the frail dwellings. Another artificer had been discovered in the settlement, and that was a shoemaker, who doubtless was a prize. A blacksmith had his forge ablaze, and some experimental attempts at brickmaking were going on upon the other side of the Yarra. Dr. Thomson had started a subscription some months before for the erection of a church and school. The building was going forward close to the place where St. James's Church was afterwards built, but at the close of 1836 was not completed. The whole township had a most primitive air, and was more like the village of some uncivilised or semi-civilised people, more like what one would expect of the dyaks of Borneo or the hill-tribes in India, than the habitation of men who had already imported property to the value of \u00a3150,000 sterling. But they knew very well what they were about, and had no intention of laying out money on allotments which they would have to buy at auction in the future, when they would probably have to pay for their own handiwork. But they lived in hope that this rude condition of affairs would come to an end so soon as the town should have been duly laid out and the land prepared for sale. Hence there was much interest centred round these tents down by the river near the Falls, where Mr. Russell and his two assistants were busy making out the plans preparatory to those land sales to which they all looked forward. Russell had selected for his base line a street running parallel to the river, just below. Lonsdale's and Fawkner's dwellings, and he was laying out others cither parallel or at right angles to this at distances of a furlong each ; but the wisdom of the settlers in not dreaming of putting up permanent buildings was shown when they discovered that with only one exception all their huts and weatherboard shanties would have to come down, as they each of them stood in the middle of one or other of Surveyor Russell's fine broad streets. But their destruction could scarcely be much of a loss."], [163, "r**-\u2014 GOVERNOR JiOURKE NAMING STREETS OF MELBOURNE. See p. 152. CHAPTER X. . Zhe pioneers of 1837. fHROUGHOUT the whole of the year 1837 the stream of settlers continued to pour into the Port Phillip district. In February there were nearly a score of vessels busily engaged in bringing sheep from Tasmania, and taking advantage of the favourable winds which prevailed at that season; each brought from three hundred to a thousand sheep at every trip ; and the trips were now in quicker succession than they had been in the previous year, inasmuch as the ships were now able to obtain a clearance at George Town, near the mouth of the Tamar, without having to go for that purpose to Launceston at the head of the river. These sheep were bought in Tasmania at from twenty five to thirty-five shillings each; the regular cost for freight being five shillings per head, and the average loss in transit about fifteen per cent. Hence the flocks of our early squatters were expensive investments, each animal having cost on an average about two pounds before it landed on the shores of the new settlement. We ma)* therefore gather how anxious the owners were for their safety; how elaborately they were shepherded, how carefully folded when evening came on ; and yet the losses on land were very heavy, and scarcely half of the animals that were shipped from Tasmania made good their footing in the province. It was at this time that Thomas Learmonth and his brother brought over two thousand ewes, and drove them up towards the head of the Barwon, where they formed the first of their Vol. I. T"], [164, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 144 stations. It was at this time that James Clarke and the Whyte Brothers, Captain Bacchus and Mr. Powlett and Mr. Green took up the land round Bacchus Marsh and the upper waters of the Werribee. It was then that William J. T. Clarke brought over his two thousand ewes from Tasmania, and settling down on the fine plains beside the Little River began that quiet career which made him, a generation later, the first of our Australian millionaires. He records' that he had no trouble with the natives; that he saw his sheep double year by year until the tw-o thousand became eight}- thousand ; and in twelve or fourteen years after his landing, the produce of his flocks he reckoned to be worth some twenty thousand pounds a year; a man of shrewd and enterprising disposition, choosing the right moment to buy and the right moment to sell, he quietly made his way to wealth and a sort of influence. It was early in 1857 that the wave of settlement which had the Yarra for its place of debarcation, came in contact with that which radiated from Corio Bay. The Werribee Plains, all that district included in Batman's futile grant, were now fully occupied, and for a distance of twenty-five miles back from the western shores of Port Phillip, the land was stocked with as many sheep as it could carry. And now the tendency was for the new arrivals to push inland to Colac and Ballarat and over the mountains in search of unanticipated pastures. But this was sharply checked in the beginning of the year by the fate of Mr. Gellibrand, and the suspicions it aroused of the disposition of the natives, and of their power for mischief. Mr. Gellibrand, having accomplished his mission as a delegate to Sydney, had returned to his home in Hobart. But his interests at Port Phillip were considerable, and he wished to meet Sir Richard Bourke there, if, as he had pro mised, the Governor should himself pay a visit to the settle ment by the Yarra, and see the nascent township duly laid out. He brought with him a brother lawyer named Hesse, and they landed at Corio Bay at the end of February. All the settlers were anxiously awaiting the arrival of the Governor, but it was understood that he would not come for yet another month. Gellibrand and his friend resolved to see some of the outlying stations on the upper part of the Barwon, and they procured WILLIAM J. T. CLARKE. horses for themselves, while Tom Gellibrand, the son, went on in the brig to the Yarra. Gellibrand and Hesse took a look at Dr. Thomson's station of Kardinia, at Geelong, where they obtained the services of a guide named Akers. Led by him they visited Mr. Roadknight's and then Captain Pollock's station, both on the Barwon, and it was their intention after that to trace the River Leigh up towards its source till they reached the station occupied by the sheep of Captain Swanston. Thence they would turn to the east across the plains by the upper waters of the Werribee and so to the Yarra. But their plan was destined never to be carried out. By some mistake they followed the Barwon under the impression that they had turned on to the Leigh River, and all the next day they were moving westward, when they should have been holding in the main to the north, the bends of the river no doubt misleading them as to the general direction. At night they slept beneath the stars in a somewhat woody country. Next morning they set out again across that wilder district which lies between Birregurra and Lome. Before them lay those wide Cape Otway Ranges covered with giant forests that even ' Letters from Australian Pioneers, p. 166."], [165, "THE PIONEERS OF 1837 145 now are little penetrated, a mighty jumble of tangled brushwood and fallen logs of huge dimensions, where deep tree-fern gullies tempt the traveller down to murmuring waters, from which he will often find it difficult to force his way out again. Akers grew alarmed, thought he had lost his way, begged of the party to return, and when Gellibrand insisted on going forward, still thinking he was on the Leigh River, and that the huts of Captain Swanston's men must ere long be visible, Akers returned alone, leaving them to follow their own course. They never were heard of again. The settlers around Geelong thought they had gone by the round-about way they proposed, and supposed them to be safely arrived at the Yarra It was not till a fortnight afterwards that this was discovered to be a mistake. Then at once were vigorous measures adopted. Captain Pollock followed the river up into the forest ; Tom Gellibrand came down with Buckle}- and Dr. Cotter and a party of five men, and followed the tracks of the horses a mile or two into the outskirts of that formidable forest ; CAPE OTWAY RANGES. but it was all too late. The unfortunate wanderers had had no provisions with them, trusting to have spent the evening of that fatal da}' at Captain Swanston's. If they had not met with a hostile tribe and been spared the lingering distress of starvation, their bodies were doubtless by this time lying thin and pallid and emaciated in some forest corner. But a subsequent expedition, organised a month or two later, followed their tracks out again from the margin of the Cape Otway Ranges and back towards Lake Colac. It then seemed clear that when they had realised the nature of the country before them the}' had shunned it and turned to the north. That is the last glimpse we get of them -Gellibrand on his little grey horse, a man of medium age and bald of head; Hesse, a tall, spare man on his mare- -following an unknown track over country that is now so comfortably peopled. The natives of the Geelong district informed this larger party of exploration that two white men had been murdered by the blacks around Lake Colac, and a native captured on the banks of the lake was stated to have confessed that the two bodies had been thrown into the lake, and that the two horses had"], [166, "146 VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. galloped off with spears sticking out of their sides. No corroboration of any sort was obtained, and the truth of the story is certainly very doubtful; but the avenging party killed at least a couple of the Colac blacks, and vengeance having been exacted, there the matter ended. But it was long a subject of speculation, and many a story was told years after of a kindly white headed old man detained by the black tribes in the heart of the Otway Ranges. Gellibrand was so well-known, and his position and influence lent him so much the appearance of a patron of the new settlement, that his loss was the leading event in the history of Port Phillip at that time, and as the settlers were one and all convinced that he had fallen a victim to the savage instincts of ferocious tribes a little inland, the spread of the settlement for a time was checked, although not so the arrival of settlers, who appeared as numerously as ever with their flocks in the bay. But it was another stream of immigration, from the north, that was destined to open up these interior lands. For Major Mitchell, by the report he had carried back to Sydney in the previous year as to the charming country he had seen, had awakened an enthusiasm in Sydney of the same sort, though not so great, as that which had spread through Tasmania in 1835. The squatters of New South Wales, after having had a series of good seasons, were now beginning to experience the miseries of a drought which was destined to grow worse and worse for some time before their prospects mended. Some were finding the utmost difficulty in obtaining feed and water for their flocks. They were interested in the accounts they heard of that land to the south so green and so little touched by drought. And it was not long before the more adventurous spirits were on their way to occupy those favoured regions. The first party that so set out carried with them only cattle. It consisted of Hawdon, Gardiner, and Hepburn. John Gardiner had already been in the district, having crossed with Gellibrand in his former trip at the beginning of 1836. He had by his own inspection satisfied himself of the capacities of the Port Phillip district, and had then returned to Sydney, where he was making preparations for taking a party overland into the new country, when an enterprising cattle-owner named Hawdon, who had talked with Major Mitchell, agreed to join him ; they were ready to start, when an old sea-captain named Hepburn proposed to make a third. Hepburn had commanded and partly owned a vessel that traded from Sydney to Newcastle, but after having overworked himself he had unluckily taken a holiday for a week or two, and during that time his substitute in the command had run the vessel ashore, and so both the property of the honest old tar and also his occupation had disappeared. He thought he would try a venture by land, and spite of the fact that he knew nothing about stock and its management, he bought a few hundred cattle, and on the Murrumbidgee joined them with those of Hawdon and Gardiner. The party had a formidable task to carry their cattle over the whirling floods of the Murray, but, after that, though their progress was slow, they had few difficulties. Mitchell's line of heavy drays on their homeward journey had cut an excellent track, as good as most bush roads, and for years the \" Major's Line,\" as it was called, was the high-road for overlanders and their flocks into the Port Phillip district. A broken axle, the frightening of a native tribe from their camp of seventy huts, were the only incidents of a three weeks' march, and then they entered the Dividing Range to the east of the present site of Kyncton.2 A dispute arose as to their future course, for over those forest-clad ranges they could scarcely hope to go with cattle. But eventually they agreed to move eastward, and so they came out on the pleasant lands round the modern town of Daylesford. They were charmed with the appearance of the country, and Captain Hepburn carved his initials on a tree, declaring '' Letters from Victorian Pioneers, p. 48."], [167, "THE PIONEERS OF 1837 147 that there he proposed to cast anchor for the rest of his life. He had been buffeted up and down on many an ocean for one and twenty years ; now in this sylvan retreat he would gather his sons and his daughters around him anel make a home for his declining years. And though in the mean time he went forward with his friends to Port Phillip, he soon came back to this chosen spot. But for the present Hawdon and Gardiner and he held south-east over the ranges from whose rugged brow- they had their earliest view of the Port Phillip plains, and where they could descry a vessel at anchor far off in Hobson's Bay. Driving their mobs of cattle before them, they descended through the settled country round the Werribee till they reached the little township on the Yarra at the close of December 1836, the first of that long line of overlanders who did so much to make the district prosper. They sound a township of turf, or at best of slab-huts, with only a couple of wooden houses to suggest the presence of civilisation. There were 'then in the settlement no cattle for consumption ; even fresh mutton was rare, the sheep being strictly kept for breeding, and salted provisions being used instead. But now as Christmas was at hand the new comers killed one of their finest bullocks, and tough though it doubtless was after much and heavy travelling, the settlers appreciated it as being -a truly Christmas cheer, which they could not other wise have had. Soon afterwards the party crossed the Yarra at Dight's Falls, and rested their weary cattle over the park-like slopes of Toorak. This was the first cattle station formed in Victoria. Hawdon and Hepburn were inclined to think it too near to the township, and to fear that with increase of population their chance of occupying it without molestation would be slight; but Gardiner wished to settle there. He bought their shares of the cattle and they left for Sydney in the early part of 1837. The districts of Kew and Hawthorn and Toorak for a long time fattened the sine cattle of Gardiner, who, on the banks of the small stream called after him Gardiner's Creek, built a snug little cottage and furnished it neatly. There his wife and daughter joined him, and as the neigh- C. H. EBDEN. bouring township grew in size so did the beef he raised come more and more into demand, and Gardiner's prime bullocks became quite a feature of the infant metropolis. Meanwhile Hawdon and Hepburn had started back to Sydney to purchase more cattle and take up other stations further inland. But long before they could return with cattle there were many others on their way to the new province, generally with sheep, though some took a few cattle also. P\"irst came C. H. Ebden, afterwards a prominent man in our colonial politics. Leaving the metropolitan pleasures of Sydney, where he seems to have cut a dash,\" he gathered his 9000 sheep, his band of shepherds, his nine drays, and his thirty horses, and with this great cavalcade he started along the Major's Line. At first he settled between the Goulburn and the Murray on those plains where now the wheat-fields of Numurkah and Nathalia arc widely spread, but the evident advantages of being near a seaport induced him to go further south. His manager, Mr. Bonne)', went on with a portion of the sheep and halted on the upper waters of the Goulburn. Ebden himself soon followed ; clad in fur-skin coat and cap, delighting in the Crusoe life of the bush, he directed the march of his long procession over rivers and through the long woodlands till he joined the advanced guard in the Seymour Pamphlet printed by Bonwick, Port Phillip Settlement, p"], [168, "148 VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT district. Meantime Bonney had found his supplies running low, and with a couple of drays he had started for Port Phillip, which he duly reached in May 1S37. On his way back he was pleased with the look of the pleasant country north of Mount Macedon, where Woodend and Kyneton now form the centres of a busy district. Having heard his favourable report, Mr. Ebden moved his flocks forward for a day or two and fixed his headquarters where the township of Carlsruhe afterwards gathered. This was the first sheep station formed by the ovcrlandcrs, and the first station of any sort to the north of the Dividing Range. Throughout this year others thronged in quick succession. There was John Howie, who moved still further forward and settled his flocks south of the ranges at Gisborne, trusting there to make a happy home for many a future day; but he returned to Sydney, embarked with his wife and family to travel by sea to the new district, and the schooner in which they sailed was never again heard of. What stormy coast may have heard their final screams, what depths profound may have received their foundering vessel, none may know. With the last glimpse at Sydney Heads all knowledge of them ceases. But John Howie's brother, inheriting his property, came to Port Phillip and occupied the station. Captain Brown and Colonel White, a pair of old military officers, settled hard-by in the Malmsbury country. Harrison crossed the ranges and pastured his sheep round Romsey and Wallan Wallan. John Hawdon, when he arrived with his brother Joseph, went still further, and passing Melbourne took his stock to the Dandenong Creek, where Captain Lonsdale was then running a few cattle under the care of Mr. Alfred Langhorne. The Hawdons left their cattle also in charge of that manager, and returned to their main station on the Murray River. Captain Hepburn meantime had bought some stock at Sydney, and set out to form his homestead in that district which he had marked out before as his in prospect. Ewes at fifty-five shillings, and rams at six pounds each, did not allow the mariner, unfavoured of fortune, to supply himself with a great flock, and yet he had nearly a thousand, with a horse and cart and a number of ticket-of-leave shepherds. At the Murrumbidgee he met the two Coghills, who were on the same route as himself, and the)' agreed to travel together. They, in their turn, were overtaken by Bowman, who joineel the party for mutual defence, and now a grand procession of nine thousand sheep, with a dozen bullock drays and their steady-jogging teams, a few carts, and some thirty or forty men, either mounted or on foot, held on their way along the Major's track.* Bowman was the first to choose. They had all camped to the south of the hill which Mitchell had called Mount Byng, but which was afterwards famous as Mount Alexander. The site where their tents were pitched is now occupied by the Episcopalian Church of Castlemaine. Bowman liked the look of the country, and there determined to form his station. The others went on, and when they had reached the promised land where Hepburn had marked his tree, he too halted and settled down where the townships of Smeaton and Hepburn now show their neat but scattered dwellings. The Coghills went yet a little further and made their station not far from the site of Creswick. So month by month the settlers poured in from the north, and the waves of immigration steadily approached each other \u2014 the Sydney squatters spreading south from the Murray, the Tasmanians north from Port Phillip. The two Mollisons were among the earliest of these overlanders, and as the elder, A. F. Mollison, has left a full and careful diary of his journey, now preserved in the Public Library, we may take his experience as a specimen of the style of life and the sort of difficulties that prevailed in these expeditions. He had visited Port Phillip the year before by ship from 4 Letters from Victorian Pioneers, p. 52."], [169, "THE PIONEERS OF 1837. 149 Hobart and had seen the settlement in its very infancy ; he was assured of the excellent prospects of the district, and returning to Sydney had purchased stock with which to take up land in it. He mustered 5000 sheep and 600 cattle on the banks of the Murrumbidgee, and in the middle of April 1837 he commenced his march down that river, but with tedious slowness, the chief impediment being the drays loaded with provisions for his party, including an overseer and some twenty ticket-of-leave men. The drays had to be dragged through the boggy ground by eight and twenty bullocks and twenty horses, and the whole of April was spent in annoying delays ; the bullocks were frequently lost at night, and a day or two generally spent in finding them ; the poles and the spokes of drays were broken in crossing creeks or jolting over rocky ground ; long days were spent while the bullocks and horses were unharnessed and yoked in one long line of straining chests to haul each dray in turn through the soft clay into which they sometimes sank. Two or three miles a day down the Murrumbidgee brought them to Gundagai, where they had to cross. The stream was not deep ; but too deep for sheep to ford, and too rapid for ferrying the stock across; so the drays A. 1. MOLLISOl were emptied, placed in a line, and logs laid across; then hurdles and a layer of green boughs, and above these a long row of tarpaulins made the footing firm. Over this rapidly-improvised bridge the long array of animals easily defiled ; but then the re-loading of the drays took time, and May was well advanced when they started southwards again. It was hard work to keep all in order ; the convict servants worked well only so long as the master's eye was on them. Left to themselves they upset the drays through utter carelessness, the}- lost the bullocks at night, and the)- suffered the stock to stray, so that the better part of the da}- was spent in making up for the neglect of the night. But in so long a line, it was impossible to keep all the animals and drays together, and when the}- began to grow disjointed it was equally impossiblc to have an eye on them all; laborious days and anxious nights filled up the time for the owner till the)- reached the Murray ; which was too deep for a bridge of drays as before, but not too rapid for a punt. So a dray was dismantled, its wheels taken off, a tarpaulin nailed round it, and empty water-casks lashed at each side. This carried fort)- sheep at a trip, and after a long and fatiguing process the five thousand sheep were safely landed on Victorian soil. Then on the)- went upon the track that Ebden had followed only six weeks before, but they could average only two and a-half miles a day. The}- met Hooson, the constable from Port Phillip, with two soldiers, in pursuit of bushrangers who were reported to have robbed a portion of Ebden's part)-. The sheep had been for some time dying along the road in twos and threes, but now the}- began to drop a dozen each day, anel there were a thousand ewes ready for lambing which must have rest. Mollison resolved to leave them for a six weeks' spell at Indigo Creek, and on a grassy space thev were gathered together. Then came a busy day or two; some laid axes to the feet of the neighbouring trees to form enclosures; others dragged them into position and wove them with boughs into fences that might retain the sheep at night; 1 ethers were busy cutting bark to form huts for the shelter of the men in the coming weeks. The crack of the stockwhip re-echoed along the creek, and the shouts of men and the bark of dogs as the sheep were rounded up anel kept from straying till the enclosures"], [170, "150 VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. were read}-. It was a busy and a bustling scene for those natives to look upon who had all their lives long known these glades only as the haunts of silence and solitude. But it was likewise a harassing time for the stockowner, and yet it had its peculiar and fascinating pleasures. The day was one of fatigue; but it was mostly spent in cantering or galloping on a willing horse ; there was much to be looked to, but there was a glorious sense of autocratic freedom. The fare was rough and the bare earth hard, but the climate was delicious and the open air a constant delight. This was the time when all civilised men throughout the world were supposed to shave their faces clean. Not to do so argued a mind either given over to the fast ways of singers and actors or else innately depraved and defiant of public opinion. It was one of the privileges of our early pioneers to disdain the dictates of fashion. They grew their beards when it pleased them, and were beheld by civilisation when they came in contact with it as benighted denizens of regions of savagery. But our early pioneers rather rejoiced in their freedom from all these restraints. A broad brimmed straw hat, a bright coloured shirt, a couple of pistols stuck in the broad belt which fastened their riding breeches round the waist, a big pair of boots with prominent spurs, and above all their moustaches and their beards, gave them the aspect of bandits in the eyes of men who wore cut-away coats with brass buttons, stand-up collars with great black neckerchiefs, who shaved religiously, and crowned all with those tall hats then first brought into vogue. In the bush the squatter made himself comfortable after his own fashion. As provisions were running short Mollison started for the settlement at the Yarra, taking with him two drays and twenty-five bullocks to carr)' back the supplies he proposed to buy. He found Ebden settled on the Campaspe; and also, about the site of Kyneton, Yaldwyn and Eyre who had just passed him on the road. This was that E. J. Eyre destined to be afterwards so famous as an explorer but the object of so much obloquy when Governor of Jamaica in still later years. Mollison crossed the Dividing Range, passed through Howie's station at Gisbornc, then through Sams's station at the Saltwater River, where, he declares, the country was the finest sheep pasturage he hael ever seen in his life. He reached Melbourne a year after his previous visit, and was surprised at the change effected in that short time; he there filled up his drays with necessaries and prepared to start back. But his men had meanwhile filled themselves with Fawkner's grog anel were utterly drunk anel incapable. He waited three or four days that they might recover, but the)- seemed always to be only getting slightly better when overtaken by another attack of the same disorder; so he had to set out with a drunken crew, those half sober lifting the others who were wholly drunk into the drays, and so, stumbling on beside the bullocks for a mile or two, the revellers sound the fumes of alcohol take their effect, and one by one they fell fast asleep. Mollison, now that they were clear of the temptations of city"], [171, "THE PIONEERS OF 1837. 151 life, waited patiently till they were recovered, and then resumed his journey back ; having joined the main body of his party, a slow march succeeded as his flocks moved forward to the upper parts of the Goulburn River, till at last on a stream now called Mollison's Creek, she chose his station and named it Pyalong. It was by this time December, and there were a score of others, all overlanders like himself, settled on these northern slopes of the Dividing Range, living in tents or huts built of reeds and mud and roofed with bark. At the close of 1837 the settlers from the Sydney side had occupied all the southern parts of the modern county of Dalhousie, and were only divided by the Macedon Range from the Tasmanian squatters who had spread their flocks over what is now the count)' of Bourke. Meantime a great change had come over the appearance of the township by the Yarra. In the beginning of the year all those dwellers in huts were impatiently waiting for that visit of the Governor which the unfortunate Gellibrand came over to attend, but did not live to see. It was the 4th of March when the Rattlesnake, still commanded by Captain Hobson, brought Sir Richard Bourke to the mouth of the Yarra. SIR RICHARD BOURKE, GOVERNOR OE NEW SOUTH WALI He was accompanied by his friend, Captain P. P. King, son of the former Governor and himself distinguished in the exploration of Australian seas. A barge, manned by blue jackets, carried the vice-regal party up the stream, followed by a procession of all the boats in the place; the settlers turned out upon the banks to accompany the procession for the last mile or so, cheering at intervals and occasionally discharging their guns in the exuberance of their delight. The Governor stepped ashore at the landing-place which now is Queen's wharf. There on the hard-baked mud, Lieutenant King and his thirty redcoats were drawn up as a guard of honour, and there also were all the settlers and many natives, a motley but respectful crowd, waiting to see the dignitary land who was to set in train the regular administration of affairs in their colony.\"' The Governor being landed and welcomed by Lonsdale and some of the settlers, a procession was formed, the whole part)- traversing on foot the grass)- slopes, past Lonsdale's hut and Fawkner's poor semblance of an hotel; past the lock-up and Henry Batman's dwelling and up to the side of the hill a little beyond the present site of Mcn/.ies' Hotel. There Captain Hunter, the secretary to the Governor, attended to the erection of tents for the party, while horses were got out in order that the Governor might ride round and without a minute's delay satisfy himself as to the work done by the surveyors. He had brought with him Mr. Hoddle, of the survey department at Sydney, to inspect and report upon the arrangements made by the subordinate officers. Together they rode round the city boundaries as already proposed, and in the main approved of them. It was five o'clock in the afternoon when they returned from their ride, and on the hill a deputation was waiting with an address, which was duly read and replied to/ The addresses referred to the pleasure the settlers experienced in welcoming among them so popular a Governor, and expressed their obligation to him for having come so far to see personally that the site of their future town should be wisely \u25a0'\u25a0 A full description of this visit is contained in a letter from Captain King, still extant, and in possession of his family. An abstract of it has been given by Rusden in his \"History of Australia,\" II. p. 77, and by \"Garryowen\" in one of his entertaining sketches. The address and reply are given in full: Bonwick, p. 439 Vol. I. U"], [172, "152 VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. and carefully laid out. In reply, his Excellency said that he saw no reason to doubt the eminent suitability of the district for the most lucrative pastoral pursuits ; and that he had felt very strongly the necessity of at once determining the situation of the chief points of occupation. The Governor stayed the night in the settlement. After a festive dinner on the first roast goose of the colony, it is said that he went down to Captain Lonsdale's hut to see the plans proposed for the city, and discuss the various matters that were connected with it. We can fancy the rude little low-roofed chamber; two officers in military and one in naval undress uniform. Bourke's handsome and chivalrous face, with that scar upon it, the memento of battle, bends over the sheets of paper spread out upon the rough table. The tallow candles that light them up gleam on his fine profile, earnest with the purpose of disposing to the best advantage, the streets and wharves of what is to be so great a metropolis. Captain King, with pencil in hand, marks in roughly the changes that the Governor suggests ; Lonsdale is there to give the benefit of his local knowledge, and Hoddle is at hand with professional advice. One of the first topics of discussion was the name to be given to the future city. Lonsdale suggested Glenelg, the title of the Colonial Secretary for the period. There would have been a fitness in so choosing, for Sydney and Hobart had both been called after the Secretary for the Colonies at the times when they were founded. But Bourke did not care to follow the precedent, and chose for us the name of the Premier of that period. William Lamb was a name well known in politics in the early part of this century, but ere he reached the highest point in his career, and directed the affairs of a great empire as Premier in the cabinet, he had succeeded to the title which his father had chosen from the sleepy town of Melbourne. And so, by a roundabout course, the quaint little Derbyshire place gave its name to the rising township, destined ere ten years were gone to leave it so far in the shade. Lord Melbourne was popular, and the choice of his name was approved ; but Bourke was convinced that the site at the entrance to the river behind Point Gellibrand was to be the future metropolis, and to that he gave the name of the sailor king, then fast failing, tottering down the last few asthmatic months that were to end his feeble reign. Williamstown is not the metropolis, but yet it is perhaps as large as Bourke ever thought it would be. The Governor seems to have approved of the general plan of the town, a rectangle a mile in length parallel to the river, and half-a-mile in breadth. Mr. Russell and his assistants had arranged for the streets to be a chain and a-half, or nearly a hundred feet wide; they were to cross at right angles, at distances of an eighth of a mile apart, nine streets thus running back from the river and five longer ones across these. Bourke raised some objections to this plan, but finally concurred on one condition, that these solid blocks of ten acres each, formed by the crossing streets, should be divided into two by running a row of narrow lanes or \" mews\" across them half-way between the main streets. These would provide access for carts and cattle to the back entrances of the settlers. This being agreed to, the names of the streets had to be chosen. That which then seemed likely to be the leading thoroughfare, as the huts were clustered there and the three houses stood upon it, was named William-street, in honour of the King; and the next to it was called Queen-street, in honour of his consort. That which la)- to the west was called after the naval captain, who was there scribbling in the names upon the plan when they were selected. No doubt the collocation of King and William was duly noted and commented upon. The street that ran down the middle of the plan was marked Elizabeth-street, in memory of that wife whom Bourke had buried nearly five years ago at Parramatta, the loving companion of a happy life-time. The next in order received its name from Captain Swanston, the most"], [173, "THE PIONEERS OF 1837. 153 influential member of the Port Phillip Association now that Gellibrand was gone; and the next from Lord John Russell, still the hero of the Reform Bill passed five years before. Stephen street commemorated the Under-secretary of the Colonial Office, and Spring-street that Mr. Spring Rice, then a prominent politician, who had been at one time Colonial Secretary. Of the streets running the other way, that nearest the river commemorated the great and worthy Matthew Flinders; and the next that David Collins who had feebly managed the settlement at Sorrento. At the request of his colleagues Bourke allowed his own name to be written next, and then the compliment was returned by writing Lonsdale's on the one to the north. No further names were selected at that time, as these provided for fifteen blocks, or three hundred allotments, quite ample it was thought for the meantime. The vice-regal party slept in the tents on the hill, and next day rode out to view the surrounding country. The summer had been very dry ; the land was baked and cracked ; yet it looked exceedingly pretty. After a long ride the Governor, in the afternoon, dropped down the river again in his barge to the Rattlesnake, where heavy rains detained him on board next day. On the day following, however, the part}' landed at Point Gellibrand, and having viewed the site of the future town of Williamstown, proceeded to Melbourne on a second visit. Bourke pointed out to Hoddle the blocks that were first to be sold, and the situation to be reserved for the Custom House and other public buildings, and directed him to have a hundred allotments prepared for sale against the first day of June, which he had chosen as the date of the first Melbourne land sale. This sale was to take place on the spot, for though the Governor had at first intendeel to sell this land like all others in the colon}-, at the headquarters in Sydney, vet he had yielded so far to the reasonableness of the petition sent him by the settlers as to direct that the first two sales should take place in Melbourne. It had not been intended that Hoddle should remain in the settlement. He had merely come to inspect and advise. But it is said that the original survey party had been by no means excessive in their industry; the Governor thought that the seductiveness of kangaroo-hunting had drawn them away from duty, and that the work was less forward than it ought to have been. Hoddle therefore was directed to take charge ; it was clear he would require to return to Sydney and make ready for his change of residence, but he was informed that he must come back and undertake the command of the survey staff of the new district. Then the Governor set out for the purpose of seeing the outlying parts of the Port Phillip district. He was attended by Captain King and several others, all on horseback, and the stolid Buckley accompanied the party as guide. Behind them came a dray laden with their tents and provisions, for the)- were entering a region where, as yet, there were neither inns nor stores. Their progress was slow, the first day bringing them only to the Saltwater, but a broken axle here and the splicing of a pole there were the only events upon the road till they reached the Barwon, and were met by a deputation of the squatters of the Geelong district, at that time numbering about thirty. When their address was read and graciously replied to, the party set out under the guidance of Dr. Thomson for a tour through the Indented Head Peninsula and round Lake Connewarre. Then leaving the doctor, the)- went round by the Leigh River, and taking the course poor Gellibrand meant to have taken, they crossed the upper waters of the Werribee, and passed round by the Saltwater and Jackson's Creek to Mount Macedon. Up its rugged face they toiled through forests of gigantic timber, anel gazed from the summit on the prospect of Australia Felix. They reached Melbourne on 21st March, after a trip extending to nearly a fortnight; in the little township Bourke received"], [174, "154 VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT'. some statistics which he had ordered to be collected, anel from these it appeared that the district then had over a hundred thousand sheep, exclusive of those brought by the overlanders, on the other side of the ranges, and the population numbered in all about five hundred persons, The Governor seems also to have received from John Batman the detailed story of his grievances, but as he was on the eve of quitting Australia, his resignation having been already accepted, there was little he could do for him. However, Batman put his case in writing, anel the Governor carried it with him to be forwarded to Lord Glenelg. In the meantime Bourke directed that he should be unmolested in the temporary occupation of the land he had used for his orchard and garden. A few days later the Governor departed for Sydney. lie had been absent for more than a month and had put the new settlement of Port Phillip in the fair way of being systematically established. It was the last important transaction of his period of office, for in a couple of months he set sail for Valparaiso, and crossing the Ancles to Rio Janeiro, took ship again for the old country, where, being now sixty years of age, he settled in his charming Limerick home. There he cheerfully passed the twilight years of a beneficent life, anel having sunk gently to rest in church during service one Sunday, was buried beneath its floor. But before he left Sydney he did yet one other good office for Tort Phillip. He sent a long despatch to London describing in most favourable terms the district he had just been visiting, and making various recommendations for the benefit of the settlers. He thought that the place was likely ere long to become of such importance that it would scarcely be fair to leave it under the charge of a police magistrate at three hundred pounds per annum, and he therefore advised, that a Lieutenant-Governor should be appointed, not that he considered there was any necessity, for the present at any rate, to make the district an independent colony with a separate legislature but at so great a distance, over five hundreel miles from Sydney, it did not seem wise to expect the settlers to look to that city for the management of the public affairs belonging peculiarly to their district. lie recommended the appointment also of another judge in New South Wales who should be able to visit Port Phillip twice a year and there hold courts for the administration of law. But the services of Captain Lonsdale would still be retained under this scheme, to act as police magistrate for the dispensing of justice from day to da)- in the minor courts. He suggested that the Lieutenant-Governor should be paid at the rate of per annum, and that a clerk should be allowed him at additional. Truly this Governor looked well forward into the future of that little township of sod-built huts ! And yet he did not by any means guess the full measure of the progress it was to sec within the next five years. But he was a wise and straightforward man, whose recommendations were valued in the Colonial Office in London, and long after he was gone from the colonies his plans were being steadily carried out. He did not, however, depart until he had heard of the success of the land sale at Melbourne. That long expected 1st of June came at last to the waiting settlers by the Yarra. Hoddle, who had been directed to push forward the surveys, and see that the assistants did less in the way of kangaroo hunting and more in the way of calculation for the future, arrived in the revenue cutter Prince George only the day before that announced for the sale. Besides being appointed permanent head of the Survey Department at Port Phillip, he was authorised to act as auctioneer at the land sales, and he brought with him Mr. Cooper, the Comptroller of Customs at Sydney, no doubt to act as treasurer in connection with the sales. The place seemed wondrousl}- festive on the eventful morning. Nearly two hundred persons were"], [175, "THE PIONEERS OF 1837. 155 assembled when the worthy Hoddle took his place on a fallen tree to explain the conditions ot the sale, with Cooper in a tent behind him to take the deposits. The city of Melbourne, as then laid out from Spencer-street to Spring-street, from Flinders-street to Victoria-street, contained torty blocks. Of these there were ten prepared for sale, but only five were to be put up for auction on this occasion. Each block was divided into twenty half-acre allotments, with frontages of about eighty feet apiece to one or other of the main streets ; and the purchaser of an allotment would be bound to erect on it within the space of two years some substantial tenement, worth not less than \u00a320. The deposit necessary was two guineas on each allotment So the first allotment of block No. 2 was submitted to auction. The competition was keen but it fell to Fawkner for \u00a332. It was the half-acre at the corner of King-street and Flinders-street, on the eastern side. The allotment next to that was also knocked down to him FIRST LAND SALE AT MELBOURNE, 1ST JUNE 1837, when the bidding had reached \u00a325. Moss, and Willis, and Joseph Sutherland, and Lachlan Macalister, who had come from Sydney to attend the sale, each got an allotment at prices ranging from ,\u00a325 to \u00a329, and then came the half-acre allotment at the corner of Flinders and William street, opposite the present site of the Custom House. This was a coveted spot, being the corner block near the wharf, and apparently likely to be a business centre. The bidding rose to before John Batman secured it, though the next one, bought by William Harper, reached only \u00a335. Mr. Strachan, from Geelong, obtained the one to the north of that at .\u00a340, and then came another tussle for the corner of Collins and William streets. John Batman obtained this also for \u00a360. And so, one by one, the twenty allotments enclosed between Flinders, Collins, King, and William streets were all disposed of at an average of \u00a337"], [176, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 156 each, among the purchasers being David Fisher, from Geelong, and Eyre, the distinguished traveller, and John Helder Wedge, and Mr. Skene Craig, who had been sent from Sydney lo be commissariat officer. The next block was a little less in demand. It lay at the foot of Elizabeth and Queen streets, between Flinders and Collins streets, and its allotments averaged \u00a331, the corners being bought by Cooper himself, and Coulstock and Macintyre and Dr. Thompson, at about \u00a340 each. John Batman secured one for .\u00a323, and Michael Pender got the cheapest at only \u00a3\\g. Then came the block that subsequently was known as \" The Block,\" bounded by Collins, Bourke, Elizabeth, and Swanston streets, now the business heart of the city, but then less esteemed than those of Flinders-street, the allotments averaging only \u00a325 apiece. Howie, the overlander, who had settled at Gisborne, obtained what is now called Nicholson's corner, four allotments, making in all two acres, for ,\u00a3140, running from Collins to Little Collins street. Captain Swanston obtained a block in the street called after him for \u00a350; and Dr. Cotter paid only the same sum for the corner of Bourke and Swanston streets ; Fawkner got the site of the Royal Arcade for \u00a320 ; the whole block bringing the sum of \u00a3504. Half a century has now gone by and that same block would to-day be a splendid bargain at three millions of money. The block that lay next to the west, now partly occupied by M'Ewan's and George Robertson's warehouses, brought an average of \u00a332 an acre ; Hoddle himself took two of them for \u00a358. The block that lies next to that again, between Queen and William, Collins and Bourke streets, was the favourite, the average being over \u00a347 for each allotment. It was here that the most excited bidding occurred. The corner of William and Collins streets was competed for by man}-, but fell to Wilson and Eyre for the great price of \u00a395 ; Mr. Ebden got an acre and a-half of that land now so frequented of lawyers for \u00a3136, being three allotments in a row. Major Mercer paid \u00a370 for an allotment facing Queen-street, and Charles Wedge, the nephew of John Helder, obtained the site of Menzies' Hotel for \u00a367. Whoever it was that found the Bank of Australasia corner knocked down to him must have been frightened at the price he had run it up to, for he forfeited his two guineas rather than take it, and it la)- unappropriated till the Wesleyans applied for it and got it for church purposes. Then came seven allotments in Williamstown, and it shows how far the settlers shared in Governor Bourke's prognostication of its coming greatness when we find that while the average price in Melbourne was only \u00a335, in Williamstown the average was no less than \u00a346 for each allotment. The total sum received for the day's sale was \u00a33842, on which Mr. Hoddle's neat little commission of 1 y2 per cent, would yield him \u00a357, but being an officer in the service of His Majesty (then within three weeks of his death), he would not take money for unprofessional work such as selling by auction ; he took his commission in the form of the two allotments already mentioned, for which he had to disburse from his pocket no more than a single sovereign; he lived to sec them worth about a quarter of a million. The expenditure on account of the settlement was at this time very nearly balanced by the Customs returns, which already amounted to over five hundred pounds per quarter, so that all this land revenue was a clear surplus ; and that it might be devoted to the benefit of the district, the English Government shortly afterwards directed that a separate account should be opened for the receipts and disbursements of the Port Phillip district, so that the exact state of matters should at any time be discoverable. And a busy market for land mi\u00b0*ht easily be prophesied when people were streaming so rapidly to the new province. The squatters indeed at this time arrived so rapidly that fresh country had to be occupied,"], [177, "THE PIONEERS OF 1837. 157 and on all sides the outlying settlers were busy exploring the land as yet unseen. At the time of the land sales in Melbourne, Ricketts held the station furthest out on the Barwon, but immediately' after that date Mr. J. N. M'Leod came over and organised a party of new arrivals like himself. They penetrated to Lake Colac, already discovered some three months before in the search for Gellibrand and Hesse ; but they also pushed farther west so as to discover Lake Coran gamite. They walked round the latter and found the natives very numerous; at the mouth of every little creek they startled a naked group, who gazed, dropped their fishing implements, and fled, concealing themselves among the scrub or up in the stony rises.' At night they slept with a careful watch set, and their horses tethered round them, and the blacks could be heard through the hours of darkness at their excited deliberations, chattering, no doubt, over the advent of those horse-riding intruders. But M'Leod did not settle so far out. He selected a station in October of 1838 on the upper part of the Moorabool; but in the next month Hugh Murray went out with 100 sheep to Lake Colac; immediately after him came ' the two Lloyds and William Carter with 5*00. They agreed to GEO. ARMYTAGK join and form one station for mutual defence; and ere long came Pollock and Dewing anel Bromfield and Watson and Hamilton and the brothers Ware, till at the end of 183S the whole of the Colac district was to a certain extent occupied. The natives were troublesome, spearing the sheep, or driving them off at night and breaking their legs, a hundred at a time, to prevent their escaping from the coverts into which they were driven. The settlers were often greatly exasperated on finding the poor animals lying in the agonies of death from thirst and hunger, and the constant loss of valuable property, these sheep having always cost at least two pounds a piece, tended to give the squatters a thirst for revenge; but except on one occasion when a native was shot in an encounter, there was no serious collision between the two races. Ere long there came other squatters Henry Hopkins and Thomas Crutch and Dr. Morris and Messrs. Airey and Darnell (the former the brother of the celebrated astronomer) \u2014 till at length a little crowding took place and the white men began to quarrel occasionally among themselves; and bitter words often followed when one squatter sound that his self-appropriated boundaries were being encroached upon by a neighbour, or worse still, by a new arrival. A tacit understanding was then arrived at that no one was to settle within three miles of another, so that each would have a space of seven or eight square miles at least free from encroachment. But whatever they might arrange among themselves, they knew very well that they could not hope for permanent occupation except by permission of the Government, and no one dreamt of putting up a house. Frail huts of bark or of reeds, daubed over with clay, formed their dwellings, and the}- slept on the bare earth, wrapping themselves round in their blankets. They lived on salt pork and saved their sheep for breeding; damper was their bread, and the)- washed all clown with draughts of dark tea sweetened with treacle tinted sugar. As for furniture, it was unknown, except such as an axe could carve out of the surrounding timber. But the)- were pioneers, and had to purchase in this way that affluence which, perhaps, one in four of them actually succeeded in attaining. : Letters from Victorian Pioneers, p. i."], [178, "158 VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. In August some of the settlers round Geelong found their flocks outgrowing the limits of their land. Six of them went out to explore the country beyond Mount Buninyong, the only height that breaks the horizon to the north-west. Dr. Thomson, Learmonth, Russell, Anderson, Hutton, and Fisher, taking with them a horse and cart to carry their tent and provisions, travelled to the mountain in two days. On ascending it they found it grassy, but more woody than altogether suited them. Holding on for a day's march further, they discovered Lake Burrumbeet, but as its waters were salt and the surrounding country was inferior, and the unpromising ridge of the Pyrenees was in front of them, they turned and retraced their steps in some disappointment. But their expedition bore fruit in the early part of 1838, when some of them found it absolutely necessary to have more room ; the two Learmonths moved out and pitched their tents on Mount Buninyong, and ran their sheep over the whole tract that extended to Lake Burrumbeet and the hills at whose foot now stands the township of Learmonth. Soon after came Mr. Yuille, who occupied the site of Ballarat; and W. J. T. Clarke, whose flocks had quite outgrown the station he held at the Little River, moved out to a place beyond Yuille's, and took up a run which he called Dowling Forest. His shepherds wandering with their flocks over the lonely ridge of hills to the site of the modern Creswick, came in contact with the cattle of the overlanders \u2014 of Hepburn and Bowman, and the two Coghills, and also of Birch, who had recently joined them in the district from Daylesford to Creswick. And away behind these overlanders, fresh squatters were coming up and steadily filling up the space between the mountains and the Murray. By the end of the year all the district between Kilmore, Seymour, and Yea, was filled up by P'arquhar M'Kenzie, who took up the King Parrot Creek, and Murdoch who took up the Muddy Creek, and Peter Snodgrass and Hughes' with others in steady succession. To the west, north-west, and north of Melbourne, the land was occupied for a hundred miles, but on the eastern side of Port Phillip the progress was slow, the furthest station being that of Mr. Willis on the Yarra at the fork which it makes with its tributary the Plenty, that district of which Eltham is now the centre, about fourteen miles from the city. But the township itself was putting on a new appearance since the land sale. When the settlers each possessed his land in full title they began to build, and fences went up at a great rate. Building and bustle went on, and were increased in November, when Surveyor Hoddle got out his hammer for a second land sale. It was held on the first of that month, when eight)* allotments were offered for sale and secured an average of \u00a342, an advance of \u00a3? on the prices The largest portion sold consisted of the three blocks bounded by ROBERT HODDL obtained five months before, Bourke and Lonsdale streets, and by William and Swanston streets. But there was much more competition in the bidding for the block which now faces the railway station, and which contains the Port Phillip Club Hotel. John Batman secured the corner opposite the fishmarket but he had to pay 7ioo for it, a formidable price in those days. This was all the land offered for sale at that time, with the exception of half the block which is bounded by Flinders, Collins, William and Queen streets, the other half being reserved for public offices. The ten allotments of this half block were the first put up for sale, and we cannot prevent the suspicion that a little arrangement had been come to among the bidders beforehand with reference to these"], [179, "THE PIONEERS OF 1837. 159 portions, for D'Arcy, one of the assistant surveyors, got two allotments for \u00a323, and Webb, the Customs House officer, had to pay no more than \u00a37 for one, while his neighbour was forced by competition to bid as high as \u00a390. No doubt the settlers let these officers get an allotment each without opposition, but when Webb wanted to buy two more, the prices were run up to \u00a362 and \u00a378. Fawkner is said to have gone about at this sale representing that he had got no reward for being the founder of the place, and asking the people like good fellows not to bid against him, and this appeal secured him a good corner allotment for \u00a310. The cheapest of Batman's three allotments amounted to \u00a359. There were three ladies among the purchasers, but they had to pay full value. The central part of the city was now disposed of, being the portion included between Flinders, Lonsdale, William, and Swanston streets, and on every or almost every half-acre plot there rose a building of some sort; at first there was a little trouble through the want of mechanics, but in a month or two that was set right by a steady influx of workmen. Then came the difficulty that the work done and the payments necessary were far in advance of the coin in the district. The only means of settling accounts was by the drawing of orders on mercantile firms in Sydney, Launceston or Hobart. But the workman who was paid his month's wage by an order to receive so much money from a certain firm in Sydney could do little with it as it stood. Hence, in a very short time there were agents on the spot prepared to discount these orders on behalf of financial people in the other colonies. Their rate of discount was high, and everybody was glad when Captain Swanston, who was chief director of the Derwcnt Bank at Hobart, sent Mr. W. F. A. Ruckcr to open a branch of that bank in Melbourne. In a little store at the corner of Queen and Collins streets, where now is the Bank of New Zealand, he opened out his books and arranged his bags of coin, and took his station behind a make-shift counter, in appearance nearly equal to that of a third-rate greengrocery in an outlying suburb of modern times. There he commenced a busy traffic, the forerunner of all that army of bankers who occupy the palaces of Collins-street with their spacious banking chambers, their elaborate strong-rooms, and their highly decorated board-rooms. Soon after, he had a rival in business when Mr. D. C. Macarthur, crossing from Tasmania, opened a branch of the great English Bank \u2014 the Bank of Australasia. He rented a little two-roomed brick cottage in Little Collins-street, which stood well back from the roadway, with a garden in front. With a room to sleep in, and a room in which to meet the public and discount their bills, he laid the foundation of the largest banking institution of Victoria. With increased financial facilities and an increasing number of mechanics the little town began to assume a very different aspect. At the end of the year there were about a hundred houses in the nine blocks of which \"the Block\" is the centre, about one hundred of the allotments sold being already provided with a building of some sort; more than half of them were weatherboard cottages; the rest were as a rule neat brick cottages, but here and there a building of two stories raised its red brick walls and the heavy eaves of its shingle-covered roof above the general level. Had we stood on the banks of the Yarra where now the Flinders-street station lies, and looked up the hill about Christmas time 1837, we should have still gazed over a prospect of sunny paddocks, about a hundred acres of land all cleared save for an occasional gum-tree spared from the forest. Lines of primitive fencing indicated the streets, wherein a gang of men that looked like ordinary labourers, but who in fact were well conducted convicts sent from Sydney for the purpose, were busy cutting channels and extracting the more notorious dangers in the way of stumps and boulders. Not that they professed to make these broad streets good through all their width; a cart track down the middle being cleared and levelled, no more was then thought necessary.

Immediately behind it rises the bare two-story brick building occupied by Fawkner as an hotel. Higher up a similar two-story building is the house of John Batman, with its store of one story and sheds beside it, wherein he carries on his trade as an importer and storekeeper. On the slope of the hill the humbler buildings are dotted, each in the midst of its plot of grass, and on the brow of the hill there is another two-story brick building in process of construction. The noise of sawing and hammering is constant, and the traffic down to that punt in front of the Custom House is beginning to cut up the track in Queen-street to some extent. P'or all the bricks are being made over the river in the Emerald Hill direction, and as there is no bridge they have to be brought across in the punt and carted up the hill upon the unformed road, which in rainy weather soon yields to the strain upon it. Yonder on the hill is the small wooden church raised by Dr. Thomson's exertions, a poor-looking structure, and hard by it a gallows-like erection of posts, on which swings the only bell that tolls out its notes over the surrounding woods to welcome all of every denomination to the services conducted by the Rev.

Soon after O7I W HjL 5 Governor Bourke's visit to the district the squatters had held a meeting and (sZgT^-T'^ prepared a petition to request that a police magistrate might be appointed I\\Vr^EH^%j with a small body of troopers under his command. They stated that the depredations committed by the natives were constant and exasperating, and o v that though the forbearance of their overseers and servants until then had been deserving of all praise, yet it was doubtful how long they would be able to refrain from retaliation, and there was a prospect of the occurrence of serious collisions. All the squatters of the district signed this document, and undertook themselves to defray any cost that might be incurred. They were clearly not of the class who would willingly wring from Government all that is to be wheedled or extorted out of it, \u2014 these early pioneers, Swanston, Brown, and Learmonth ; Fisher, Yuille, and Stead ; Cowie, Sharp, Steiglitz, and the Manifolds ; Hopkins, Bell, Dobson, Morris, Austin, Murray, Russell, Roadknight, Lloyd, Thomson, and those others, to the number of forty-six in all \u2014 who put their names to the end of this document.' In compliance with their request Sir Richard Bourke appointed Captain Foster Fyans, late of the 4th Regiment, to be police magistrate at Geelong, and under him sent a clerk and three constables with a part)- of half-a-dozen convicts. 1 Labilliere, Vol. II., p. 174."], [182, "162 VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. These all entered Port Phillip in the first steamer that ever floated on our waters, though not on her first trip. The James Watt had already made one voyage from Sydney to Melbourne and back again. On this her second visit to the bay she brought as passengers not only Captain Fyans, but also Dr. Cussen, the first general practitioner of Melbourne, and several Sydney merchants on their way to settle at Port Phillip. Fyans had been entrusted by Governor Bourke with a quantity of goods for the natives \u2014 slops for the men and calico dresses for the w-omen, together with a blanket for each, and supplies of sugar and flour. On his arrival he brought over Buckley from Melbourne and gathered a total muster of 275 natives \u2014 men, women, and children. He records that when the blankets were distributed there were a few short of the number required, whereupon the naked warriors who had to go without set up a terrible yell, and as they stamped and danced with rage a wild uproar began. Fyans had behind him his two constables and his six servants ; these he ordered to load and present. The blacks knew what was meant by the click of the triggers, and so a little expostulation from Buckley had a speedy and happy effect ; they calmed down and retired, no doubt to do some breaking of heads in private. Immediately before the arrival of Fyans, Mr. David Fisher had completed his residence on the banks of the Barwon, near the site of the bridge \u2014 the first house of Geelong; and the James Watt, when she brought the police magistrate, also brought those who were to be the inmates of that cottage, the wife and children of Mr. Fisher, who formed the first family inhabiting Geelong. Dr. Thomson built the second house; but though a magistrate had been appointed and a house or two was rising there was no arrangement for the survey of a town, and no intention of selling land there. The little village that sprang up in 1838 and 1839 had a haphazard growth, and consisted almost entirely of two or three stores and as many hotels for the supply of the squatters in the neigh bourhood, and more particularly of their men \u2014 a very thirsty set when they had their cheques in their hands. These places were all of wood, and straggled over the grassy slope, one clump of stores and a cottage or two standing on the margin of the bay, while more than a mile away, on the Barwon, there gathered the dwellings of Fyans and his clerk and his constables, together with that of a customs officer sent down to the district. The name Geelong was at first given to all that wide district over which Foster Fyans wandered for the three years of his residence CAPTAIN FOSTER FYANS. at Corio Bay, constantly in the saddle, his duties carrying him as far as Colac on the west and Buninyong on the north, wherever difficulties occurred with the blacks. It was not till 26th October of 1838 that the Governor at Sydney proclaimed the township of Geelong, and that a sale of allotments in it was announced for the 14th of the following February. Unfortunately for Geelong this sale took place in Sydney, and of the fifty-three allotments sold no less than thirty-two were purchased by residents of Sydney, who had no intention of joining the settlement and helping to make it thrive. Their only object was to hold the land as a speculation, in the hope that Geelong would rival Melbourne in the rapid increase in the value of its land. Of the remaining twenty-one, eight were bought by residents of Melbourne, some of them also as speculators, and only ten allotments were bought by residents of the district. Dr. Thomson took two of them, his acre costing him \u00a36$ ; Foster Fyans took two for \u00a396;"], [183, "THE INFANT COLONY.\u2014 1838 AND r8jip. I6; William Kerr also two for \u00a3jg ; Felton Mathew also two for \u00a362 ; Charles Nicholson and E. B. Addis, one each for \u00a350 per allotment. Thus there were only six among the purchasers who proposed to utilise their purchases, and this system of holding sales so far away from the locality gave to Geelong in those early days a very different chance from that obtained by Melbourne. It is to be noted that with only one exception these Geelong purchasers chose their land on the banks of the Barwon, all of them being together in what was called South Geelong. But the Sydney and Melbourne speculators made a better forecast of the future when they took up the allotments along Corio Bay, in what was called North Geelong. For these the competition seems to have been keen, the average price rising to nearly a hundred pounds for each half-acre. The little town had a very quiet existence for a time, the life of a small up-country township in a squatting district. It saw the bullock waggons lumber up to Strachan's or to Champion's store ; when the cattle were unyoked the clumsy vehicles were loaded up with the flour, the sugar, the tea for the stations they had come from, while the teamsters adjourned to Mack's Hotel, an unlicensed shanty facing the bay, and there discussed the rum which formed their favourite potation. Thither also came the shepherd and the shearer to \" knock-down \" their cheques, and play their unsteady game of quoits for half a year's earnings, or to join a rEELONG IN 1842. few riotous comrades with pipe and glass to swear at governors, and magistrates, and squatters, and all sorts of people more cleanly than themselves. But Geelong began to gather a reputation as a port for shipping wool ; and though there was no pier the schooners and brigs of the Tasmanian traffic drew up close to the shore, and were loaded with many a bale from the inland districts. The traffic with Melbourne was carried on in the Lapzoing schooner, which made two trips every three weeks; but for postal purposes a more rapid communication was provided early in 1S39, when a mail cart began to run between the two places once a week. At that time, however, the second township of Victoria was certainly Williamstown, which even so carl)- as 1837 could boast of ten houses, and is said to have had rather an attractive look, its clustering cottages being bosomed prettily in the green of the encircling bush. There,"], [184, "164 VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. on its wave-lapped promontory, where a little wooden stage carried the lamp that was the only approach to a lighthouse then in Victoria, it looked neat and fresh ; though still primitive, especially in regard to its crazy little wooden jetty. The most notable dwelling in this little cluster was that of Captain Hugh M'Lean, who kept a boat with two men always in readiness for the purpose of conveying passengers across to the Sandridge side of the river. The usual mode of journeying from Melbourne to the ships at Williamstown in those times was to cross the Yarra in the punt opposite the Custom House, then to follow the sandy track walled on either hand by the dense tea-tree scrub, and so to that silent wilderness which now is Sandridge. On the verge of the beach, then lapped by en stal waters, the traveller had to light a fire with the boughs and branches of the tea-trees, and when the smoke became visible across the blue expanse in Williamstown, Captain M'Lean's boat would come dancing over the lipples with a couple of boatmen to take him on board and land him at the little seaport. There was plenty for this ferry to do, for Melbourne with its two hundred houses and its sour or five hundred people was now becoming quite a bus}' place, the metropolis of a population of about three thousand persons, anel full}- half its traffic was carried on through Williamstown, a large number of the vessels which traded to Port Phillip avoiding the necessity of crossing the bar and following the tedious river windings that led to Melbourne. Throughout 1838 the little city continued steadily to put on an air of coming greatness. It was even beginning to rejoice in the possession of a suburb, a few houses having clustered where Fitzroy now- extends. All the land lying beyond the limits of Victoria, Spring, Flinders, and Spencer streets had been proclaimed suburban, and on 13th February, 1838, the first sale of the suburban lands was held in Sydney. On that occasion there were sold forty blocks each of over twenty acres, comprising the district now covered by Fitzroy and Collingwood. The surveyor's lines at that time ran through sandy patches and thickets of scrub, and occasional glades of gum and she-oak ; but there were no streets laid out, the land being intended for agricultural not for building purposes. The first blocks put up for sale were those that fronted the Victoria-parade to the north. The}' extended for two miles, and reached to the river where now stands the Victoria-street bridge. These fifteen blocks brought a total of less than two thousand pounds, the average being about three shillings and sixpence per foot frontage, though the depth of most of them was over a quarter of a mile. In short, though each of the blocks was of about half the size of the Carlton Gardens, they realised an average of only \u00a3132 each ; that block which now contains the busy thoroughfares of Brunswick anel Gertrude streets brought only .\u00a3100, while the next one containing Smith and Gertrude streets secured \u00a3150. It was a great misfortune that this land was sold in these great blocks to speculators ; for each e>f them laid out a town in his own fashion, and subdivided his land, not in the way that would eventually be most conducive to public welfare, but in such a manner as to secure him the best return for his money. Hence when the little suburb of Newtown, as it was then called, began to spring up at the corner of Nicholson-street and Victoria-parade, the streets were without system and wholly different from those of the city. The lanes that crossed and recrossed some of the blocks were perhaps broad enough while still only grassy paths enclosed by panel fences ; but now they are narrow and mean-looking anel they run in the most bewildering way, for though strictly rectangular, they are rarely in the same line with one another, and the pedestrian who follows up a street laid out by Hughes and Hoskings will find it suddenly terminate, and he has to turn to right or left to find the beginning of some new street, laid out after the fancy perhaps of P. L. Campbell ; and so over the whole of this suburban area, each block being systematic within"], [185, "THE INFANT COLONY.\u2014 1838 AND 1839. 165 itself, but inconsistent with all the others. The blocks that were most coveted at the Sydney sale were those upon the river banks, for some of which over .\u00a310 per acre was given. Captain Lonsdale obtained one just beyond the Studlcy-park bridge for \u00a3150. The block which secured the highest price, \u00a3288, was that on which Abbotsford now stands ; all these river-frontage blocks were in demand as villa sites for the merchants of Melbourne, who even then were beginning to thrive. One of the busiest was that Mr. W. F. A. Rucker, who had come over to open a branch of the Denvent Bank, but now contrived to do a good business also as shipping agent and general storekeeper, his place in Queen-street, opposite the site of the Harbour Trust's office, being the emporium not only for groceries and wines, but also for clothing, hats, and boots ; not williamstown in 1840.

At first this wool was sent to Hobart to be there reshipped, but at the end of 1838 there sailed the first vessel, laden with 400 bales to be taken direct to the wool sales in London. But if stores were numerous, hotels were in still greater abundance. The Lamb Inn in Collins-street was a roystering place for shepherds with cheques, while the Governor Bourke of Michael Carr, close by the present site of Briscoc's, was likewise a place wherein the hirsute"], [186, "166 VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. stockman sat and rolled his morsels of strong tobacco Li his dirty hands and stuffed it into his short clay pipe. Hard by stood the sod-built hut for which a license was held by Michael Pender, and where his wife served the foam-mantled beer across the ricketty counter while he himself was busy on the roads with his bullock team. On the opposite side of Queen-street the Royal Highlander, kept by James Connell, raised its dingy front of wattle and daub out of the rocky pathway ; and there were many others. Indeed, it is recorded that before the end of 1839 Melbourne had no less than eighteen publichouses. The liquor laws were then very strict, as there were convicts in the settlement. No one was allowed to serve a convict servant with drink except by the express permission of his master ; and no one was allowed to serve a person of drunken habits with liquor. But indeed the settlement badly needed some such restrictions, for whatever the character of the squatters and settlers themselves, there could be no doubt that their servants, half of them ticket-of-leave convicts, were people who required to be a little looked after. The quantity of liquor consumed was excessive, and among the first public acts of the clergy when they came was the inauguration of a temperance society in October 1838, when three of them addressed the assembled crowd of rough-looking men, and after explaining the nature and blessings of the great movement tLat then was beginning to stir the masses in the old country, invited their hearers to save their money and spare their healths, by signing the pledge. But the leading place among the hotels of Melbourne was Fawkner's, the family hotel of the period. In it, as he notified, the traveller and sojourner could obtain for two guineas a week \" all the usual requisites of a boarding-house and hotel,\" and in addition he could find \"mental recreation of a high order.\" His hotel provided twelve newspapers, seven magazines, the three British Quarterly Reviews, and a choice collection of novels and poems, of works in theology and history and so forth. Thus in that community of men engrossed with business it was Fawkner who strove to kindle the spark of mental culture. He was a steady reader himself, and doubtless as he lounged in smoking-cap round his door, or in his parlor, or upstairs in the stuffy rooms, he poured forth a world of good advice, dogmatic and didactic and self-important, but extremely well-meant. It was to this care of Fawkner's for the mental condition of the settlement that it owed the institution of its first newspaper.\" On New Year's Day of 1838 there appeared the opening number of The Melbourne Advertiser. There was neither printer nor type in the township, and Fawkner had to issue it in manuscript. The first nine numbers consisted of a sheet of foolscap each, with four pages neatly written in a round clear hand. The first number opened with the grandiose remark \u2014 \"We do opine that Melbourne cannot reasonably remain longer marked on the chart of advancing civilisation without its Advertiser. Such being our imperial fiat, we do intend therefore by means of this our Advertises to throw the resplendent light of publicity upon all the affairs of this new colony.\" There was little in the way of news, but three pages of advertisements justified its name of Advertiser. In the second number there appeared the particulars of a tragedy, fully detailed, and also two verses from Lalla Rookh, eight lines of exquisite melody, suggesting the good taste of the chooser, and thus the little manuscript had the orthodox form, and displayed the requisites of a local newspaper \u2014 a leader, a horrid murder, a poet's corner, and abundance of advertisements. The little paper appeared every Monday, and was delivered gratis at the chief stores and public places. But as its circulation increased, the labour of writing out once a week thirty two copies of sour pages each must have been very considerable, and at the end of - Bonwick's Discovery and Settlement of Port Phillip, Melbourne 1856, p. 122."], [187, ""], [188, ""], [189, "THE INFANT COLONY.\u2014 1838 AND 1839. 167 February Fawkner saw with great pleasure the arrival of a supply of type from Tasmania But the compositor who had been engaged to come along with the type failed to appear, and Fawkner had to start operations with a lad of eighteen, who had in his tenth year been connected with a printing establishment. This precious printer having been secured, the tenth number of the Melbourne Advertiser was set up in type for the 5th of March, 1838; and so in a shed behind Fawkner's hotel there was worked off the first printed matter ever produced in Melbourne, a little four-paged quarto, on dingy paper, with two columns on each page. Half of each issue consisted of advertisements, but there was a very creditable supply of readable matter, and for some months it appeared with unfailing regularity every Monday morning. But alas for our first Victorian journal! The Port Phillip district was part of New South Wales, and throughout New South Wales there was in force a statute enacted by Governor Darling ten years before, according to which it was directed that no one should publish a newspaper without lodging at Sydney an affidavit setting forth the name of the printer, and without finding heavy sureties for the proper conduct of the paper. Fawkner being a Tasmanian, had not known of these regulations, and was probably mortified when Lonsdale informed him that according to instructions from Sydney he must put a stop to the issue of the little journal until all legal forms had been complied with. So the first Melbourne journal, like man)- another since then, suffered an untimely collapse. Fawkner could not proceed to Sydney and neglect his business, but after some trouble he obtained permission to register his paper in Melbourne, and also to find his sureties there. But some time had been required to secure this concession, and it was not until the 6th of February in the following year that the paper re-appeared under an extended title, The Port Phillip Patriot and Melbourne Advertiser. Even then its mishaps do not seem to have ended, for here and there we find among its early files whole pages upside down, and half columns illegible through rough and faulty printing. And in the interval, while Fawkner's journal was suspended, there appeared two journalists from Sydney to provide the rising township with a legalised newspaper. They had duly registered their names and found the necessary sureties before they left, and when they arrived in September 1838 there was no obstacle to an immediate commencement, unless it might be the small prospect that offered of a reasonable circulation for some time to come. As one of them remarked, it seemed of little use to issue a newspaper for kangaroos and tree-stumps. George Arden was to be editor and chief contributor to the new journal \u2014 a well-educated youth of about twenty years of age, a man of some considerable promise and literary taste, whose career might have been most honourable but for that weakness to which the abundant hotels of Melbourne offered every encouragement. Thomas Strode, who undertook to print and publish the new venture, had been employed in the office of the Sydney Morning Herald. He brought with him a quantity of second-hand type, and a sadly dilapidated little hand press.3 While Strode arranged his type and set up his press in a humble building near the site of the present English, Scottish and Australian Chartered Bank, Arden went out into the district and canvassed for subscribers. In spite of the primitive appearance of the township, he obtained orders for no less than 300 copies, and man)- of the colonists undertook to give the enterprising pair both advertisements and job printing. The first number of their paper, The Port Phillip Gazette, appeared on 27th October, 1838, and never sailed to present each week its four small pages of four columns each. It was better printed than Fawkner's and 3 Bonwick, Discovery and Settlement, p. 129. Vol. 1. W"], [190, "168 VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. conducted with much more ability. Its little leading articles were smart, and often very decidedly outspoken ; sometimes too outspoken. The youthful Arden had not been eight months in the editorial chair, not forty of his lofty compositions had enriched the literature of the world and castigated the weakness of the community, when he was challenged by the indignant Dr. Cotter, and had to make his appearance one winter morning down by the grassy levels where now the Fishmarket stands, his Byronic form being the target at which Dr. Cotter's unsteady pistol was aimed. But that gentleman was very nervous, and the shot was hopelessly wide. The magnanimous Arden then fired his pistol into the air, and having added a reputation for cool intrepidity to that for literary ability, he was no doubt glad to terminate the Pickwickian encounter without the shedding or the loss of blood. So terminated our first, though not our only duel. During this period of Melbourne's existence the Post-office was a very poor affair. Our first postmaster was Captain Benjamin Baxter, who was sent out from Sydney to be Clerk of Petty Sessions at Port Phillip. He had been stationed at Sydney, and when his regiment received orders to proceed to India he preferred, for the sake of the health of his wife and daugh- ters, to remain in Australia. He therefore had nothing to do till Governor Bourke gave him these two positions combined at a salary of ,\u00a3200 a year. But ere long it suited Captain Baxter better to take up land and strike out for himself. So the post-office was removed from his cottage in Flinders-street and transferred to Mr. Skene Craig's store in Collins-street. But early in March that gentleman resigned the COLLINS STREET, MELBOURNE, FROM A SKETCH MADE IN 18*38. responsibility Nor can we wonder that he did so. The fifty pounds a year salary he received might have been enough for the work that had to be done at first ; but the population increased at a remarkable rate. In one month there were 600 arrivals, and at the close of 1839 the population of the town had risen to three thousand, of the district to seven thousand. No wonder then, that the system of managing the postal affairs of the community on a counter behind the butter and cheese would scarcely suit its altered requirements ; and all the more so as these people were a singularly industrious set of folks at the writino* and receiving of letters. In one month no less than 13,000 letters and papers from Europe had to be distributed amongst this busy community, and it became clearly necessary to appoint a professional postmaster. For that purpose Mr. Kelsh arrived from Sydney, and opened a little post-office in Chancery Lane where the Selborne Chambers now stand ; and Melbourne began to find itself in touch with the great world by means of its postal services. The mails for England, however, were very irregular, and were made up only when a wool ship was about to sail for the old country, the first being the Louisa Campbell in June 1839. The mails for Tasmania also were dependent on the chance of there being a vessel bound across the Straits, and so also those for Sydney partook at first of the same irregular character. Indeed it then"], [191, "THE INFANT COLONY\u2014 1838 AND 1839. 169 often required three weeks for the coasting schooners and barques to go from Melbourne to Port Jackson, and sometimes their voyages lasted even longer. But Sydney was the headquarters of the colony and the seat of government, and an arrangement which left an interval of six weeks at least between the sending of an inquiry and the receipt of a reply would not long satisfy these energetic settlers. Now, it had so happened that in 1837, when Hawdon and Hepburn had left their former companion, Gardiner, at Toorak and returned overland to Sydney, they had speculated on the prospects of establishing an overland mail from Melbourne along their track. They had noted the road, and the most suitable stages upon it ; where the feed would be good for horses at some resting-places, and where fodder would need to be stored away at others. On reaching Sydney Hawdon proposed the establishment of an overland pony express, and though the Sydney Government at first objected to the expense, yet at the close of 1838 they agreed to the scheme, and invited tenders for the service. Hawdon himself tendered and obtained the contract for a fortnightly mail, to start on the first day of January 1839. His stockman, John Bourke, then in charge of some of his cattle at Dandenong, volunteered to ride with the mail-bag to and fro between Sydney and Melbourne. We can imagine no more venturous life than that of this humble Irishman, who spent his days in cantering through the long stretches of unoccupied wilderness over a rough bush track ; who every night la)' down all alone in the eerie darkness, a hundred miles at times from the nearest help, and with unknown dangers surrounding him in the murky depths of the far extended forests. His first hundred miles lay through the settled districts of Port Phillip, where by arrangement he stayed at the squatters' places ; then, as he followed the Major's Line, he had two hundred miles of unoccupied country to traverse, but after that could journey as before from station to station through the settled districts to Sydney. Very different was the mail to Geelong. Every Wednesday morning at seven o'clock the smart waggon turned out in front of Nodin's store in Lonsdale-street, and received its bag of mails, and its passengers for Geelong at \u00a32 each. It reached Geelong the same evening, and having given the passengers a day to transact their business, started back on the Friday morning for Melbourne. Hawdon was the pioneer of another mail route. In 1838 he had sent his manager, Mr. Bonney, with 300 head of cattle from the Goulburn over to Adelaide ; they had a long and eventful journey, but reached that settlement in good enough condition to realise a remarkable profit. The Port Phillip settlers saw their opportunity. Meat was at almost famine price in Adelaide, and E. J. Eyre and a score of others were not slow in following Hawdon's example. But it was the middle of 1839 before that gentleman himself paid a visit to Adelaide, and it was certainly a novel fashion of exploring he adopted. On nth July, along with a friend named Mundy, he started in a gig drawn by two horses in tandem style, and the settlers turned out in numbers to see him set off with the first overland mails for Adelaide. They were twenty seven days upon the way, and so clear and open were the grassy park-lands they traversed that they averaged their twenty miles a day through unexplored country ; they met with no adventures, though on one occasion they were beset by a yelling tribe of blacks. Mundy lashed his horses into a gallop, and the)- left the naked threateners far behind. While Melbourne thus was opening up communication with places all around, its internal prosperity never for a moment flagged ; and the news going abroad of its rapid increase the most astonishing mania for speculation began. So unaccountable was the rise in prices, that in 1839 the four allotments at Nicholson's corner secured \u00a34200, though only two years before they had been purchased for \u00a3140. In September land was valued in Collins-street at \u00a332 a foot, which"], [192, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT 170 two and a-half years before had been knocked down by Hoddle for less than ten shillings per soot. That allotment, where now is the office of the Australian Widows' Fund Life Assurance Society, had been bought in June 1837 by Wilson and Eyre for .\u00a395. On 12th August, 1839, they offered it for sale in nine small sections, and secured for it 191 5 guineas. Mr. Latrobe, in 1840, sent to Sydney a schedule showing that the hundred allotments sold in June 1837 at an average price of .\u00a335 each had been resold in 1839 at an average of \u00a32019, while of those allotments sold in November 1837 at an average of \u00a342 a majority had been sold before the end of 1840, the highest price being \u00a39450 for the corner of Collins and Queen streets. No wonder that when profits like these were being made the speculative instincts of men were roused to their utmost. The Sydney suburban buyers took advantage of the excite ment. That land along Victoria-parade, which they had bought in twenty-acre blocks a year ago, they now offered in small allotments at a grand sale to be held on 21st October, 1S39. A bellman paraded the streets for several days beforehand, announcing a free breakfast and a free ride into the country for those who wished to attend the sale of suburban allotments out at the corner of Victoria-street and Nicholson-street, and they were extremely successful in their venture. For several years after this the auctioneer's bellman was one of the prevailing features of Melbourne. Half-a-dozen could sometimes, on a busy forenoon, be heard banging their big handbells up and down Collins-street, and shouting out the merits of town lots and suburban lots. The free breakfast speedily developed into the champagne lunch, and ere long this became a well-recognised institution of the place. The emigrant newly from home must often have opened wide his eyes at the scene he entered on when he went to buy an allotment for his dwelling. There is the land \u2014 a piece of the ancient forest, slightly cleared, and not a house visible; but in a corner there is a tent, round which half the men of Melbourne seem to gather, and in which the popping of corks is incessant. On a few prostrate trees the ladies of the town are seated, eating sandwiches and sipping their half-glasses of champagne. Over their heads are floating a few gay flags, and a perfect gala feeling prevails around, till the auctioneer mounts the handiest stump, and with a little preliminary badinage introduces his glorious eulogium on the scrub-surrounded spot they occupy ; the men crowd round in a silent knot, and bidding begins at first very quietly, with a few cynical remarks, but with increasing excitement and a strange exaltation of feeling, till at last the new arrival hears the scrubby desert knocked down for a price at which he could have obtained almost any site in London, except the very heart of the city. For a time the public purse did not benefit very greatly by this increase of prices; for after the first two sales the auctions had been conducted in Sydney, where the bidding was confined to a knowing few. There, in a shed-like auction-room in George-street, near the foot of King-street, on 13th September, 1838, the capitalists of Sydney gathered for the sale of about seventy central allotments. There were a dozen buyers from Melbourne and a couple from Tasmania, but fifty-one of the allotments were secured by the Sydney purchasers. Dr. Thomas Black relates an incident characteristic of the times. He was a physician at Penrith, and was on that day down in Sydney for a holiday. As he strolled in idle fashion along George-street he was attracted by the sounds of an excited auction, and turning in for a moment to be a spectator, noticed at a glance that all the most astute people of Sydney were there, and that under a certain amount of assumed indifference there was a great deal of excitement. It was a sale of land at Port Phillip, a place he had never heard of; but there could be no doubt that the investment was considered a good one, and in a careless spirit"], [193, "THE INFANT COLONY.\u2014 1838 AND 1839. 171 he nodded his head cheerfully to Mr. Jaques, the auctioneer. At the close of the sale he found himself possessor of two allotments of that block in which the Argus office now stands \u2014 one of them a corner block. Subsequently he was asked to sell them again at a great advance. He parted with one of them which faced Russell-street for some \u00a31500, though it cost him only \u00a3129; but luckily for him he refused to part with the corner allotment opposite the Town Hall, and just below the Argus Hotel. It cost him \u00a3167 in that Sydney sale of 1838 ; he now draws three thousand a year as ground rent from it, and could secure for it a hundred and twenty thousand pounds if he sold it. The result of this sale was to extend the city on paper from King-street to Russell- street, so far as is included between Flinders and Lonsdale streets. Another sale at Sydney, on nth April 1839, carried the boundary up to Spring-street, almost the whole of this eastern part being bought by Sydney firms. The steady rise in value can be seen from a comparison of the average prices at the successive sales. At the first in 1837 \u00a335 for each allotment, at the second \u00a342; in 1838 the average was \u00a3118, in 1839 \u00a3124, in 1840 \u00a3445; but this does not adeqately measure the increase for the land sold. In the latter sales the allotments were steadily moving away from the envied business centre. Fawkner resold his corner ot King and Flinders streets, which cost him \u00a332, for no less than \u00a31600, and that only two years after his purchase. Ebden, at the end of 1839, when he sold his three allotments in Swanston-street, obtained \u00a310,000 for them, though their total price had been only \u00a3136. About the middle of 1839 the site of Richmond was put up for sale in Sydney in twenty-five acre blocks; Hoddle had in that year laid out due north and south two miles ot that long street which now runs from St. Kilda to Preston, nine miles in all, bearing his name in parts, in others called hligh-street, Punt-road, and Barkly-street. East of this was to be the new suburb, and all that part between Hoddle-street and Church-street was disposed of at this sale for about \u00a320 per acre. But it was not built upon, the buyers having taken it chiefly for speculative purposes. At the middle of 1840 there had been 463 of the Melbourne allotments sold for \u00a372,699, or an average of \u00a3157 for the half acre. It was quite clear then that people had ample faith in the future greatness of the city, and were willing to risk their money in it. And during the same period there were sold of suburban and country lands no less than 150,000 acres for \u00a3231,000. At that rate the district was not only self-supporting, but left a balance of a couple of hundred thousand pounds to make the Sydney finances, which before that had been for a time rather weakly, grow once more flourishing. But the Port Phillip settlers could hardly complain. Their prosperity was phenomenal. Never was a community of its age so festive. In the ample paddocks that surrounded their dwellings the empty champagne bottles were conspicuous among the debris, and the auctioneers had them stacked in little piles in their back yards. How many pleasant picnics out in the delicious sunshine of a land sale did these represent! A settler who arrived at the end of 1839 describes4 a land sale he attended at Sandridge. It was then known as \" The Beach,\" or afterwards \" Liardet's Beach \" when the first hotel had been erected on it. A carriage or two and numerous dogearts kept the punt at the Falls very busy, and when they were over the river they span along the track at a lively pace with scores of riders behind them on good horses. Arrived on the beach the company found several tents where luncheon was spread, where turkeys and hams abounded, where beer and champagne were in equal plenty. Then the ladies strolled upon the sands, and the gentlemen smoked their cigars in the shade of the fringing tea-trees ; 4 E. M.

Meanwhile a good deal of talk had been going on among the soberer folk as to town allotments and suburban allotments, and the surveyor's lines had been inspected, and the prospects of the place discussed. Thus these festive business people made their preliminary inspection, and a day or two after, when the allotments were put up for auction in Collins-street, they realised \u00a370 an acre for tea-tree scrub, with not a house within several miles. But less than a year later a similar sale of suburban land was held after much the same manner ; save that the site was nearer the town, and that a band of music played popular airs, to the sound of which intending purchasers could examine the allotments. And now, when a few months of interval had enhanced the value of land, the average price secured for these blocks was no less than \u00a3700 an acre. Never before or since in the world's history did a band of settlers in a new and untrodden land form their little town with so full, so exalted, so uncompromising a faith in its coming greatness and splendour. In this rustic-looking village the people familiarly spoke of it with easy confidence as the nucleus of what would certainly, in a generation, be reckoned among the world's great cities. Next to the joys of a land sale among the amusements of these sanguine pioneers, came the excitement of horse-racing. Melbourne was not a year old when it founded its racing club, and on 15th and 16th March, 1838, the first meeting was held, when sour races were run \u2014 the Town Plate for a prize of \u00a325, the Ladies' Purse for a prize of \u00a320, the Hunter Stakes for a prize of \u00a315, and on the second day the beaten horses competed for a prize of \u00a310. On the conclusion of the meeting all the members adjourned to Fawkner's hotel for what was to be an annual dinner. The second meeting on 20th March, 1839, was less successful, for Mr. Brown's \"Mountain Maid\" carried everything before it, and the newspapers chronicle in atone of disappointment that the hurdle race was a mere burlesque. Balls were frequent and quite brilliant for so young a place ; the cheerful strains of the polka were familiar to the forest glades when darkness set in at night. A cricket club was founded in March 1839, and in the following month our first cricket match took place, when the married men defeated the bachelors ; but in the following March the bachelors defeated the married men by an innings and seventy-four runs. In May 1839 there arrived our first professor of music, Mr. Jameson, from Bath, and next year Mons. and Mme. Gautrot took up their quarters in Little Collins-street and began a series of instrumental and vocal concerts in the largest room of one of the hotels ; they remained a year ; but in addition to their entertainments there were concerts given by amateur talent on behalf of the building funds of the various churches, so that throughout all the winter months those half-made streets were often musical with the songs of Bishop and the harmonies of Bellini and Donizetti. Other elevating forms of amusement were provided by frequent lectures, of which the first was delivered in the little temporary Scots Church ; and also by a circulating library established by Fawkner in a little stationer's shop which he had opened in Collins-street. But Melbourne for the first time showed to the full how festive it could be on the occasion of Lady Franklin's visit in April 1839. The wife of Sir John Franklin, the new and popular Governor of Tasmania, had in a year or two made herself singularly beloved by the colonists, and the Tasmanian settlers of Port Phillip were resolved to do her honour. She was on her way to Sydney, but had called at Melbourne, intending to go overland. On the evening when she landed the town was brilliantly illuminated, or at any rate as"], [196, "174 VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLLS: PAST AND PRESENT. brilliantly as the supply of candles would allow. Fawkner, at whose house the lady stayed, had his windows all ablaze, and having bought up all the fireworks in the place \u2014 no great matter as we may suspect \u2014 he entertained the town with its first display of that sort. Those who had in vain sought for fireworks to testify to their delight, were not to be found wanting in their expression of devotion ; so they paraded the street firing pistols and guns all night till far on towards the morning ; whereat Lady Franklin must have felt singularly content, as in the dead of night she tried to sleep off the weariness of a sea-sick voyage. Next evening the blacks of the district mustered to give an exhibition of a corroboree, and for the last time the streets of Melbourne were lit up to the leaping flame of their weird fires. Lady Franklin held on the following day a public reception ; and in the afternoon, when she started on her ' long drive for Sydney, her vehicle was attended for two miles along the sandy track by almost all the men of the place on horseback, who having seen her well out into the country about Carlton, fired a grand salvo to bid her God-speed on her journey. But Melbourne was still more exuberantly festive on another occasion, a few months later, when it had to accord its heartiest reception to its first Governor and his lady, on their arrival from England. Bourke in his last despatch from Sydney had urged on the Home Government the necessity of appointing a Lieutenant-Governor for the rising colony, and had suggested that Colonel Snodgrass, the military commandant at Sydney, would be found very suitable for the purpose. The Government had followed this advice so far as to appoint a gentleman as suggested, but they gave him the title of Superintendent only, and they fixed their choice on Mr. Charles Joseph Latrobe, a dilettante gentleman then well-known at the Colonial Office in London. He was the son of a Moravian clergyman settled in Ireland, but of French descent.' He seems to have been brought up to no profession, and though well educated he had spent his youth and early manhood in a somewhat desultory fashion ; he had taken to literature in that mild degree which consists of publishing records of everyday travel over well-worn ground. Thus in 1829 had appeared his \"Alpenstock,\" a series of sketches of Swiss scenery and manners \u2014 sweet, graceful, pretty \u2014 a book that pleased for a season, then disappeared. Again in 1832 he published \"The Pedestrian,\" the record of a summer's ramble in the Tyrol, in which trip he fell in love with a young Swiss lady. At this time he was acting as travelling companion to a youthful French nobleman, who proposed to take a tour through America, and it so happened that in Havre, while waiting for a vessel to sail for New York, they stayed in the same hotel with Washington Irving, who was greatly pleased with the modest, cultured, and singularly honourable character of this young Moravian Latrobe. Their acquaintance ripened into friendship during the voyage in the same ship across the Atlantic; and Irving induced Latrobe with his young charge to join him in his delightful rambles up the Hudson to the scene of Rip Van Winkle's adventures \u2014 a glorious country which the delightful inventor of them had never yet seen. All this intimacy was of much future advantage to Latrobe, who later on accompanied Irving in that \"Tour on the Prairies\" which formed the subject of one of his most charming books. Latrobe and the young count, as Irving says in one of his letters, joined him in galloping \"through forests and prairies, campino* in tents at night, and hunting deer, buffaloes, and wild turkeys.\" On his return to England Latrobe published in 1835 his book \"The Rambler in North America,\" and in the following year the last of his literary ventures, \"The Rambler in Mexico.\" These books, kindly and genial in tone, touched on a question that was then to the front in English politics \u2014 the treatment of \u25a0' M'Combie, p. 56."], [197, "THE INFANT COLONY\u2014 1838 AND 1839. 175 aboriginal populations by white colonists. The philanthropic party had just obtained a glorious triumph when with the last toll of the midnight bell, on 1st August, 1834, slavery was abolished forever in the British Empire. But it was now pressing ardently forward on a new movement \u2014 a worthy one, and of noble intention, though sometimes pushed to the extent of a craze. This Exeter Hall party was resolved to obtain for the aboriginal inhabitants of British colonies all the rights which their common humanity ought to secure for them ; and Charles Joseph Latrobe threw himself with some little ardour into the cause. His books gave him weight; he had seen something of the treatment of natives in America, and in 1837 the influence of his party secured his appointment when Lord Melbourne desired a gentleman to visit the West Indies and report on the condition of the negroes now that they had been free for a year or two. On his return to England he found that the question of the settlement of the Port Phillip district and the treatment likely to be accorded to the natives of it was a prominent one at the Exeter Hall meetings, and that the result of some little agita tion was that Lord Glenelg, the Secretary for the Colonies, had undertaken to send out a gentleman to act as Protector of the aborigines in the new settlement. What more na tural than that Latrobe should be selected for the purpose ; but on second thoughts, as it is asserted, he was advanced by Lord Glenelg to the more responsible position of Super intendent of the district at a salary of \u00a3800 a-year, as suggested by Bourke. In December 1838 Latrobe wrote from Dublin signifying his grateful acceptance of the post, which must have been very welcome, as he had no thing permanent to do, had no means, and had recently gone over to Switzerland to marry his Neufchatel sweet heart. Glenelg allowed him \u00a3400 for travelling expenses, and lest there might be no houses in the settlement when he got there, Latrobe caused a neat little Swiss chalet to be prepared and to be embarked along with him in March 1839. CHARLES JOSEPH LATROBE. He arrived in Sydney on 26th July of that year, and stayed with Governor Sir George Gipps for a couple of months to learn the mysteries of the business of governing colonies. But the news that a Governor had been appointed all to themselves had reached the settlers at Port Phillip at the end of June, and they spent the interval in eager anticipation of his arrival. At the end of August the papers announced that he was daily expected; at the beginning of September a committee was appointed to arrange for a grand reception, consisting of Captain Lonsdale, Mr. Rucker, Dr. M'Crae, and P. W. Welsh. All things were duly in train, but still the Governor's approach had not yet been announced when on the last da)- of September the Pyramns, from Sydney, slipped quietly up the port and, as those were still the days before the telegraph, she was anchored in Hobson's Bay ere her arrival was suspected. Latrobe next day came up the river quietly, and stayed the night with Captain Lonsdale ; but that sort of entry would not suit the loyal colonists. He had to return to the Pyramus and come up again in state on Thursday, 3rd October. A salute of nine guns is said to have announced the fact of his landing, and a great concourse cheered him as he stepped ashore in front of the Custom House. The Reception Committee welcomed him and took him up to Collins-street, where the Auction Room of Mr. Williams was considered to be the most suitable place for a public meeting. There in a crowded Vol. I. X"], [198, "176 VICTORIA AND LTS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. assemblage Mr. Webb, the Collector of Customs, read out the commission appointing Charles Joseph Latrobe Superintendent of the Port Phillip District of New South Wales. There was a Government land sale to be held that day in Williams' rooms, and Latrobe waited to see the humours of a sale of suburban allotments. This was the second of a new series of sales ; the last six had been in Sydney ; now there was a series of four going on in Melbourne ; and on this occasion forty-five suburban blocks of from five to thirty acres each were sold for a total of nearly \u00a311,000, at an average of nearly \u00a310 an acre. Then the Reception Committee took him over to the Melbourne Club, at the corner of Collins-street and Market-street, and there they read him an address of welcome, to which he suitably replied. In the evening Melbourne went wild with excitement, and the publicans had a profitable time. Several great bonfires blazed on the hills around the township, and the houses were illuminated. Fireworks added to the display in several quarters, and, as before, parties of men paraded the streets all night firing pistols and guns as a means of giving vent to their effusive feelings. The Governor thus welcomed no doubt took an early opportunity of moving about among the community in which his lot was to be cast for the next fourteen years. A strange place it must have seemed, stranger than any he had seen in his wanderings in America. It was then but sour years old, and only two years had elapsed since the first land sale, but already it had 2500 inhabitants, and its rustic streets were lined with 360 dwellings. Collins-street was, however, the only street that was continuous for any distance. A good view of the town was to be had by climbing its hilly slope, past the Town Hall site and up to the place where now the Scots' Church stands. Looking back from that vantage ground of grass and out-cropping boulders one could see the little town lying in the hollow and ascending the opposite slope. Collins-street was a broad expanse with properly made channels on either side and footpaths duly laid out. Some thirty houses faced it on each side, all of them surrounded by vacant ground enclosed by fences of various patterns-. Potato patches and kitchen gardens lay close to the street where now so many banks and stately buildings raise their pillared fronts. Some of the houses were of brick, but most of weatherboard ; about one in ten were of two stories; the rest were cottages, generally rather neat looking, but here and there a wattle-and-daub, or even a slab hut stood as a survival of the earliest times. At the further end of the street on the brow of the opposite hill stood the most conspicuous building, Fawkner's Hotel, crowned by what the proprietor called the obser vatory, a little promenade he had made on top of his roof, from which, as he regularly advertised, the dwellers in his house could obtain a view of Williamstown and the Bay. Collins-street was grassy in the middle, and marked by many stumps ; in rainy weather it became very muddy, and where it was traversed by the deep chasm of the Elizabeth-street gully it was a formidable bog. An advertisement of this time announced the finding of a Wellington boot in it, the owner probably having been glad to withdraw his leg and leave the boot. One of Latrobe's earliest cares was to set a dozen labourers to work with spade and pickaxe to improve the condition of Elizabeth-street. Down Collins-street, cropping the grass there wandered goats in considerable numbers, a feature oi the place ; and pigs likewise found a pleasant run in the street till they made themselves felt as a nuisance a month or two later, when a ferocious sow mangled a couple of children in Flinders-lane. After that accident it was decided that the settlers were to keep their pigs within their own enclosures. There was still a good deal of timber, even in the heart of the town, and it was not uncommon to see a tree just felled lying across the street ; a proclamation of Latrobe forbade the people to leave these after dark. As business hours bc\"*an, the seventy shops of the place, mostly \"general stores,\" unfolded their shutters, and the auction"], [199, "THE INFANT COLONY.\u2014 1838 AND 1839. 177 rooms floated out their crimson flags to attract their knots of customers. That old mounted bell man \u2014 Sullivan \u2014 grey-haired, astride upon an old grey horse, made his appearance, a well-known identity in the place ; on his head a small staff supporting a red flag with the magic word \" Auction,\" while sandwiching him were boards before and behind containing bills of the sale for the day,\" and three or four others on foot soon join him in the outrageous clatter, banging and flourishing their hand-bells on the sidewalks till the authorities are forced to interfere and suppress the practice. There were few women on the streets, not a quarter of the population being female ; but Latrobe must have been struck by the appearance of the men, who at this period of Melbourne's existence had discarded the dark suits and black hats of the old world fashions, and were clad as befitted the climate in white suits with broad-brimmed straw hats. No less strange would be the appearance of the youthful squatters clattering down the streets on frisky horses, whiskered and bearded, or with flowing moustaches, in blue serge shirts and cabbage tree hats, with belts supporting tobacco pouches and perhaps a couple of pistols ; in breeches, with Hessian boots and big spurs, they formed a class most characteristic of these high times though they soon died out when squatting lost its romance and became a prosy business. But perhaps the most picturesque feature in this pristine Collins-street is to be found in the natives who frequent the place. Yonder at a corner is a knot of two or three with a couple of scraggy dogs. They are selling besoms made of tea-tree twigs, and, in broken English, replying to the banter of the passers-by, who condescendingly address them as Jack, or Jimmy, or Polly, or whatever name happens to rise first to their lips. They are growing much more sophisticated, these children of the forest, and ask for grog and tobacco, or join in the comic songs of the day. Here comes a native woman, stark naked, down the hill of Collins-street, carrying her infant on her back, and singing \" I'd be a butterfly.\" There is a man squatted on the footpath, propped against the fence, with head dropping down upon his bosom. He has been learning the fierce attractions of strong drink. The Government has strictly forbidden the sale of liquor to these poor people, and a fine of \u00a35 is invariably inflicted on any publican known to supply them ; but in spite of that they get it, and as hostile tribes that formers roamed far apart are now congregated round the town, there are frequently heard out in the bush when the rum has circulated for an hour or two in the evening the diabolic shouts of men, the heavy thud of clubs on savage skulls, and the weird wailing of women. In the morning a dead man or two, or more often a number with gashes and raw wounds, would be brought into town for the white man's aid. Sometimes the natives affected European costume. A native in a cast-off sailor's suit was not uncommon, but as a rule the suit was wanting in more or less essential parts. One writer describes a black as clad in nothing but a claw-hammer coat, a string of kangaroo teeth, and a tuft of cockatoo feathers. Another feature sure to attract the notice of Latrobe consisted in the bullock-drays of the district. Down Collins-street they came with their lines of sulky bullocks. A broken place on the banks of the Elizabeth-street gully led them into the bed of the stream, whence they emerged up the banks of clay, straining and pulling, with many a \" gee-wo,\" where now the wooden pavement lies between Allan's music warehouse and the Bank of Victoria. But on that Friday Latrobe had some business to get through, and, doubtlessly, he was long closeted with Captain Lonsdale, learning the condition of affairs in the colony. It must have been a comfort to an amiable but not strong man like Latrobe, who had a constitutional fear of responsibility, that his predecessor was not to leave the place ; in the previous month \u25a0 Curr's \"Squatting in Victoria.\""], [200, "178 VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. Gipps had sent Lonsdale a letter complimenting him on his success during the three years he had been in charge, and formally appointing him police magistrate for the new district. Not long afterwards, however, he was promoted to be the sub-treasurer of the district, and Mr. James Simpson obtained his position as police magistrate. On the next day, Saturday, Latrobe and his wife were the recipients of a popular address, signed by 238 residents, in which they were heartily welcomed. Latrobe replied in an oration which was considered by a section of the community as being very pietistic ; but that was a matter of taste. He was a man of great and unaffected piety, while the earl)' settlers of Melbourne were not a church-ooinsr race. Not one in ten troubled himself to attend service o o on a Sunday. There were five churches in the place, but all miserable little buildings, though tenders had just been let for the erection of two that would be more creditable. Otherwise the Sunday was strictly kept ; all the shops were closed, except that the public-houses were suffered to be opened for two hours in the afternoon, only however for the sale of liquors to be carried away to people's homes. Visitors of that period have left on record the pleasant feeling of the Sunday mornings in the youthful town ; and from their descriptions we may imagine it as Latrobe saw it on that, his first Sabbath in the settlement, when a lovely morning of October was wakened with the fresh gum-tree scent wafted out of the all-surrounding forest ; when the notes of a score of bell-birds tinkled up to Lonsdale's house, where Latrobe was staying a few days, from the pleasant river banks below ; when white cockatoos displayed their sulphur crests along the fences of Collins-street, and parrots in gorgeous crowds settled on the stumps of Bourke-street, and the laughing-jackass startled the new arrival with his early-morning merriment. In the cool dawn the tinkle of the sheep-bells comes pleasantly up out of the park like knolls of Hotham and Carlton and East Melbourne ; then, as the dreamy spring morning rises high, the chimneys of the scattered cottages wreathe upwards their thin blue smoke, and the pretty little place awakes to the peaceful Sabbath life. A few hours later a crazy sound, re-echoing from the only church bell, swung on a gallows-like erection on Batman's Hi'l, summons the Episcopalians to their service, and warns those of other denominations that their services too are commencing, though not announced by the orthodox bell. The little church holds only some seventy or eighty people, and when room is provided for the convicts employed in the town by Government and for the choir, there is left accommodation for only a small congregation ; but about a month later Latrobe had the satisfaction of laying the foundation of St. James's Church, a structure which, if architecturally clumsy, had at least the merit of being large. One of the most regular of the worshippers in the primitive wooden church had been, when the year began, John Batman, who had subscribed fifty pounds towards its erection. It is said to have been a striking sight in the early days of Melbourne to see the founder of the colony, with his handsome family, ascending the hill among the she-oaks on their way to church ; his wife and eight daughters, who inherited the fresh and ruddy complexion of their father, attended him and assisted him up the little slope. For he was now no longer the hale and hearty fellow who four years before had traversed these wildernesses on foot with gun on shoulder. Disease had been making sad havoc with his burly frame, and now he tottered slowly up the hill to church when he was well enough to leave his bed. For the last few months indeed he had been drawn to church in an invalid's chair on wheels, and almost lifted into his scat within. He was still in the prime of life, being only thirty-nine years old, and might have expected to see the city grow and to have shared to the full in its prosperity ; but he had been reckless of his constitution in the labours and"], [201, "THE INFANT COLONY.- 1838 AND 1339 179 adventures of the past; with a liver out of order he should have shunned the festive board, and abstained from the wine-cup. But to a man of his jolly temper and instincts of social generosity, that was almost an impossibility. He sought instead to mend the evil by heavy doses of mercurial medicines, but found his health go steadily down from week to week. For days in bed, for weeks seated in the sunshine, an invalid before his door, he spent some weary months; and then being seized by a sudden cold he succumbed to these gathering maladies, and died on the 6th of May, 1839. Two days later a long procession numbering fifty gentlemen followed his remains up William-street to the cemetery where the English portion had not long before been consecrated by the Bishop of Australia on a flying visit from Sydney. Before his illness he had launched out into a number of enter prises, which, had he lived, would no doubt have made him a wealthy man, but during his two years of ill-health, he had been unable personally to attend to them ; they got none of that nursing care required for businesses in their embryo stage, and when he died his affairs were very much involved ; his wife and daughters were only slightly provided for; his only boy was soon after drowned in the Yarra, and only three of his daughters grew up to womanhood, these being happily married. His brother Henry did not long survive him. He had been appointed chief constable of the district, and he fulfilled the duties of that position for a year, when through festive propensities he lost it ; soon afterwards he died, within a month or two of his brother. For nearly fifty years in that grassy reserve, their dust has slept unconscious, while all around has been flowing the full-volumed life, and all around has rolled ever louder and louder each year the roar of the vast city they founded but never saw. No monument marked the site where the mourning party on that 8th of May laid to rest the body of John Batman. Not till 1 88 1 was any effort made to do that honour to the memory of the pioneer of our pioneers. It was then due to the exertions of Mr. John J. Shillinglaw that a handsome obelisk was raised by public subscrip tion over the spot where his bones had so long been at rest beneath the waving grass. For motto, as indi cating the life-work of the man, it bids the visitor \" Circumspice \" \u2014 \" Look around\" and behold the issue that in half-a-century has come of the toils, the difficulties, and the dangers, undergone by John Batman.

Not only was there a scarcity of men open for employment, but those that were to be had were in the main of unlovely complexion. For thouo-h Victoria, after two narrow escapes, had been saved the fate of becoming a place of direct transportation, yet, as it was a portion of New South Wales it was at first subject to the reception of convicts, and, to a larger extent, of prisoners who had served their sentences and had been duly liberated. The colonists who first peopled Port Phillip all of them crossed from Tasmania, and were precluded from carrying with them any convict servants, for Governor Arthur had no power to assign the prisoners of the Crown to persons resident beyond the limits of his own jurisdiction ; and any prisoners who crossed to the new settlement must have been treated as runaways. Now these early settlers had every inducement to cultivate the goodwill of the authorities in Hobart Town and they were, therefore, very careful that no such cause of collision should occur. Nor, indeed did they desire convicts as a matter of personal choice. There seemed to be a sturdy desire to make the settlement the abode of free men, and of free men only. Thus, in June 1836,"], [203, "THE ERA OF IMMIGRATION\u2014 1840 TO 1844. 181 when Mr. Stewart visited the district, he reported to Governor Bourke that there were but two convicts within its boundaries, and that these had been stowaways on board a vessel from Tasmania ; these men were then at large in the bush, but the colonists were on the watch for them, resolved to return them to Tasmania as soon as they should be captured. But the \"over landers \" who drove their flocks from the Murrumbidgee and the districts round about Bathurst had no such scruples. The new district was part of their own colony, and there was nothing illegal in carrying their assigned servants thither, nor would they have seen any reason why one portion of the colony should be kept more select than another. From the end of 1836, therefore, a stream of convicts accompanied the flocks that crossed the river Murray. Gardiner, Hawdon, Hepburn, Howie, Ebden, Mollison, and all those who followed the Major's Line in January, February, and March 1837, brought from ten to twenty prisoners each as shepherds or stockmen. But in the latter month Bourke became aware that this process was going on, and in alarm lest the distribution of prisoners over so wide an area might be the cause of eventual trouble, he published in the Sydney Gazette an order that no convicts were in future to be carried so far south without the express permission of the Superintendent of Convicts at Sydney. On his trip to Melbourne he seems to have recognised more fully the difficulty thus presented, and to have been sensible of the prevailing feeling in the township that the district should be kept as free as possible from the intrusion of the convict element. Not long after his return to Sydney he was fortified in his original intentions by the instructions of the Colonial Office in London. Lord Glenelg wrote on the 31st May, 1837, directing Bourke to \"abstain to the utmost practicable \" extent from the assignment of convicts to the settlers in the Port Phillip District. The \" objections to the system which at present prevails in New South Wales with respect to the \" assignment of convicts would exist to a still greater degree in a new settlement, where there \" cannot be the same means of conferring order and imposing restraint which are available in \" an older settlement. Nor at a moment when H.M. Government are preparing to put an end \" to the system of assignment in New South Wales should I consent without the greatest \" reluctance to its extension, even to a limited degree, to any new settlement.\" But Bourke was then leaving Australia, and it was reserved for Gipps to carry out these instructions. He at first contented himself by simply complying with the order to discourage assignment as much as possible ; but he found that this did not check the introduction of convicts into the new district. For the settlers who occupied the southern parts of New South Wales naturally carried their assigned servants with them when the)- moved across the Murray into the greener country to the south. The prisoners themselves had no inducement to object ; the further they went from Sydney the further they were from the Superintendent, from chain gangs, and from whipping triangles. It was therefore a difficult matter for Gipps to prevent this influx of convicts into the new settlement, and in October 1838 he complained to Lord Glenelg that \"it has been found \" impossible to prevent prisoners from being taken there, notwithstanding the desire expressed \"by your lordship to limit the number as much as possible;\" and he respectfully urged \"that \" if it had been intended to prevent altogether the assignment of convicts in that part of the \" territory, it would have been better to have made it a separate Government.\" That was very true; for it was quite certain that so long as the Port Phillip district was part of New South Wales the settlers would fail to sec any reason why the)- should not carry their servants with them into any part of it, and the idea of keeping one district uncontaminated would have seemed to them not only mere sentimental nonsense but also singularly unfair to all the rest of the colony. But the object of the British Government was a good one. The"], [204, "182 VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. need of encouraging emigration was then more urgent in England than it ever had been, and the Cabinet had not long before carried out two large movements for that purpose, resulting in the settlement of West Australia and South Australia. Port Phillip seemed to be by nature an excellent field for the same purpose. But the English artisan or farmer who was thinking of emigrating was generally loth to go to a convict colony. To be known as an inhabitant of Botany Bay or of Van Diemen's Land was in those days anything but complimentary among the working classes of England, and it therefore suited the Government to avoid as far as possible this objection \u2014 grounded on ignorance, no doubt, yet none the less difficult to conquer. The foundation of Adelaide had proved a costly experiment, and the English Government no doubt saw with satisfaction the growth of a similar settlement absolutely free of expense to itself, and equally adapted to the reception of thousands of emigrants if only the convict scare could be avoided. The action of Lord Glenelg is therefore perfectly comprehensible, and was in every way a wise one, but of course the squatters of the Murrumbidgee and Maneroo did not appreciate his motives, and each of them continued to carry his convict servants whither he carried his sheep and cattle. In December 1838 Gipps announced in the Gazette at Sydney that he had received instructions to discontinue altogether the system of assignment in the Port Phillip district. A fortnight later he issued a proclamation that thenceforward all assignment to towns in that district would be discontinued ; and in August 1839 another proclamation announced that no further convicts would be assigned to the district, whether for town or for country. Yet for a couple of years more the convict servants continued from time to time to accompany their masters down the Goulburn Valley, and the process only stopped in 1841, when the stream of \" overlanders \" practically ceased. By that time there had been introduced into the district 524 convicts, of whom 147 were the assigned servants of overlanders who had \"squatted\" close by the Major's Line in the valleys of the Goulburn and Ovens. There were 231 in private service south of the Dividing Range, the larger portion round Western Port. The remainder, consisting of 146, were in the service of the Government, busy with the construction of roads, and streets, and wharves. Melbourne, in those days, had over sixty of them. They lived in barracks where the Sailors' Home now is ; that block which is bounded by Spencer, King, Bourke, and Little Collins streets having been reserved from sale for this and other public purposes. They were all, however, of the well-conducted class. There never were an)' chain gangs in the streets of Melbourne. If a convict misconducted himself he was sent back to Sydney to undergo the degradation of toiling there in yellow coat and manacles. The convicts in Melbourne worked in ordinal-)' labourers' clothes at the ordinary tasks of labouring men. They wore no uniform save on Sundays, when they marched to attend service in the little English church. They seem to have been well treated, and to have attracted little notice in the settlement. But from time to time the overseers from the surrounding stations sent in their refractory servants to be punished ; and on several occasions the triangle was set up, and the woods of Batman's Hill heard the dull thud, the stifled moan, the muttered imprecation of some refractor)- prisoner. The inhabitants of Melbourne disliked the exhibition, and expressed their dislike freely enough ; it was not often repeated, for as no new convicts entered the Port Phillip district after 1839, except a few who were taken to Gippsland in 1840 and 1.841, while those already in the place were well conducted men with short sentences, who were rapidly liberated on the expiration of their terms, it naturally happened that even the faint appearance of convictism that had"], [205, "THE ERA OF IMMIGRATION\u2014 1840 TO 1844. 183 once been in the place rapidly died out of the settlement. The convicts who entered the boundaries of Victoria did not in all exceed 600, a number which made but a small fraction of the total population, and before the end of 1845 there were not 120 persons in bondage in the colony. There was a very much larger class of men introduced into Victoria in these early days during the scarcity of labour. These were the expirees, convicts who had served their terms and become perfectly free ; and ticket-of-leave men, those whose sentences were not yet completed, but who had been set free under certain conditions. These formed the bulk of the shepherds and servants of the squatters ; these were the mechanics and tradesmen for some time in the new colony ; and a troublesome lot they were. The general wage was from \u00a330 to \u00a340 a year, and occasionally a bounty was offered them for every hundred lambs reared by their care. It was thus a poor creature who could not secure at least his \u00a340 a year, and as all their rations were supplied them, and they were located in wilds where there was no great expense for clothes, nor any occasion for the little expenditures of more social dwellings, they practically managed to save their whole earnings. A few, a very few of the more prudent and cautious, laid aside their yearly savings, and when ten or a dozen years were gone found themselves the masters of well-stocked stations. But the great majority had no such thrift in their composition. It was a lonely life they led, even when two of them inhabited a hut together on an outstaticn ; lonely and altogether devoid of those pleasures which form the highest ideal of enjoyment that men of that class conceive. They lived their twelve months out in anticipation of a life of unchecked riot when their term of engagement should be ended. For twelve months their lives proceeded in the same mechanical round ; they got up in the early morning and shifted the hurdles of their fold, so that the sheep should not encamp two nights running on the same piece of ground. Then, whilst one did the little cooking that was wanted and took charge of the hut, the other dangled all day at the heels of about five hundred sheep, lounging over the pastures or under the she-oak shades till evening sent him home again to fold his flocks. Next day they exchanged duties, and so in long monotony the year whirled round. Sometimes a man held an outstation all by himself for months together, only seeing a comrade's face for a few minutes every two or three weeks, when some one called to see how he fared, and to bring him his supply of provisions. It was often noticed that after a few years of this life these solitary occupants of the outposts developed symptoms of eccentricity, or of that mild form of madness known as melancholia. It was not to be wondered at therefore that these men, without the pleasures of reading, without the mild excitements of work-a-day life among fellow-workers, without even the little distraction of social gossip, should look forward with a perfect craving to the month of carnival that would terminate their solitary confinement. At last the term was over, the cheque was received, and the shepherd was off upon his way to town. There were in Melbourne a dozen places ready to receive him, and he soon found residence in one of them. The landlord, with unfailing kindness, took charge of his cheque and promised to supply everything wanted till the amount should be all consumed. Then the foolish seeker after pleasure found more of his own description in the place all equally engaged in the process of \"knocking down\" their cheques. A glance into one of those places was a sorry sight. A long low room built of sods or slabs, with the cold black earth for a floor, was supplied with a long table down the middle, whereat there were seated all day and all evening two rows of slobbery fellows, each with a glass at hand ; some gambling, some smoking, some maudlin out Vol. I. Y"], [206, "184 VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. vows of eternal friendship, some in quarrelsome mood swearing at large and occasionally getting up on their unsteady legs to dare some offending party to the combat. Through the smoke-trailed atmosphere some boozy sleepers are seen stretched on the forms round the room, or a dirty heap wallowing in its own vomit indicates the wretch whose enjoyment is reaching the culminating point, that crisis when the landlord will declare his money to be all spent and drink to be no longer obtainable. Then comes the host, no longer in kindness, to expel him \u2014 to carry him out to a stable or shed where he can sleep off his potations with offence to nobody, and without attracting the attention of Captain Lonsdale or Mr. Simpson, who might perchance refuse a license to a place notoriously conducted on these principles. The constant presence of these festive shepherds with plenty of money to squander attracted to Melbourne a low class of women, almost all of them liberated convicts, who crossed from Tasmania, or sailed from Sydney to share in the dirty spoil. The western end of Little Collins-street became infested \" KNOCKING^DOWN \" CHEQUES.' with these characters, and was the scene of nightly brawls that soon gave to Melbourne, while still but a pretty country town, one at least of the features of a great metropolis, and that the most odious. Hence came work for the police and the necessity of a gaol, which was built of bricks on the Government block at Spencer-street. At first it was on a very modest scale, but in September of 1840 it had to be enlarged, and a year later the enlarged premises were fully occupied, no fewer than seventy persons being under sentence in it ; and at that date there was in course of construction a treadmill, though it did not begin to revolve under the weary tramp of its living freight until the April of 1842. The presence of this ex-convict population hurried on the assumption of a metropolitan aspect in other respects. In 1839 it was found necessary to have the streets regularly patrolled by police ; a regular bench of magistrates commenced to sit, with Captain Baxter as the clerk of sessions, and on the 1 3th day of May in that year Edward Jones Brewster held the first Court of Quarter Sessions, with Mr. H. W. Carrington acting as Crown Prosecutor.7 7 Gurner, Chronicle os Port Phillip, p. 46."], [207, "THE ERA OF IMMIGRATION- 1840 TO 1844. 185 There never was any record kept of the numbers of these ex-convicts who came to Port Phillip from the other colonies, but they certainly reached to a total of several thousands, the influx being greatest in the year 1841, when about 2000 are supposed to have entered the settlement; but as they all came over as free men there could scarcely be any register kept of them as a class. They were not bound to report that they had been convicts, and doubt less they did not volunteer any information on that delicate sub ject. But in no other year were they nearly so numerous, and after that date there was a rapid decline in their numbers, the consequence of a great change that had taken place in England with regard to transportation. For in 1837 a committee of the House of Commons had pub lished a report with voluminous EARLY MELBOURNE POLICE OFFICE. evidence on the subject of transportation ; the appendix contained details of the lives and treatment of convicts, which gave the death-blow to the system. We can scarcely regard the popular feeling that sprang out of this report as being the logical outcome of the inquiry, for the popular mind was most powerfully affected by the evidence relating to Norfolk Island and Macquarie Harbour, places whose horrors were attributed to the transportation system, though no more characteristic of it than gaol-confinement was characteristic of the average English life of the period. Of the convicts who arrived in the colonies, only those who were convicted anew, only those who had again committed some formidable crime whilst in their convict condition, were sent to these terrible places ; only a small proportion ever saw them, but these were ruffians of the most revolting description. It is still a question to be discussed whether it was not after all the better way to gather together all this foul moral cancer and let it rot itself away in its own horrible pollution, rather than suffer it to remain scattered among the better class of convicts and act as a leaven, for ever undoing the good effects that transportation was calculated to accomplish \u2014 for ever tempting those unfortunate exiles who, though somewhat balanced between the choice of good and evil, were yet a little inclined to follow the good. But certainly when the twice-distilled villainy of the British Empire was gathered in two or three small spots, the foulness of the odour they\" spread abroad was such as men could not escape observing. The result of the publication of this report was the creation of a strong and somewhat hysterical feeling in England against transportation, and though the Government did not see its way to at once discontinue the process, it checked to a considerable extent the numbers that were so sent out to Australia. In 1839 there was an almost complete cessation of the transportation of convicts under short sentences, and in the following year Lord John Russell, as Secretary for the Colonies, directed that transportation to New South Wales should entirely ceasc, and that convicts should be sent only to Van Diemen's Land. These however were"], [208, "186 VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. mostly prisoners under sentence for many years, or for life, and the result was a rapid diminution in the number of expiree convicts after the year 1842. The authorities in England had in 1S37 entered upon a new system in regard to criminals. Large penitentiaries, of which the great establishment of Pentonville was regarded as the type, were instituted for the \"primary punishments\" of offenders; many kinds of reforming influences were there to be exercised, and the prisoner, who for a few years received the benefit of these influences, and had satisfied the authorities of his intention to lead an honest life in future, was then to receive a ticket-of-leave, and to be taken at the State expense to one of the colonies, there to be set free, subject however to the necessity of reporting himself at intervals, and liable in case of misconduct to be deprived of his ticket-of-leave. According to this system, therefore, the worst of the criminals were never to be sent away. The lowest dregs of society were retained by the old country, and securely enclosed within prison walls; only those who, it was thought, might reasonably be expected to form desirable servants to the colonists were thus sent abroad. The system was, to some extent, the reverse of the transportation method, according to which the worse a prisoner was, the greater was the anxiety to send him abroad. This new departure in criminal treatment was not in working order till the year 1842, and the first batch of good-conduct prisoners was ready for transport beyond the seas in 1844. Port Phillip was then distressed for want of labour, and the English Government thought to confer a favour on it by selecting it for the reception of these exiles. Accordingly in November 1844 the Royal George anchored in Hobson's Bay freighted with a class of men undoubtedly superior as an average to the expiree convict who had been admitted to the colon)- in such profusion during its first five or six years of existence. , But the circumstances now were regarded by the colonists as being radically different. That convicts, when again become free men, should of their own accord seek the shores of the new settlement was a matter perhaps to be lamented, but certainly not to be interfered with by any known law. But when it was proposed systematically to land every year some three or four thousand prisoners who had served only a part of their sentences; when it was proposed to establish in the colony a large system of supervision of these people, there was every prospect that the settlement would be branded in the eyes of the British public as a penal colony, and that from that time forward there would be a check to the immigration of the free settlers, who were clearly the more desirable residents, and who, unless the stream were thus checked, promised ere long to overwhelm the convict element so completely that in so dilute a solution, its presence would be barely discernible. Some of the squatters, it is true, of the Western District were favourable to the scheme which would relieve them of the difficulties experienced through want of men ; but the general feeling of the community was against it ; and the English Government yielding readily and generously to its wishes, directed the captains of the next vessels then receiving new batches of \" Pentonvillers,\" as they were called, to proceed to Van Diemcn's Land. That island was regarded by the English authorities in those days as having no rights to conserve in this matter. It had been colonized solely for the purpose of being a convict settlement ; free people had never been asked or encouraged to go there ; if they had taken up their abode in it, they knew to what disadvantages they were subject, and the English Cabinet placed them on a very different footing from the free settlers of Port Phillip who had founded and formed for themselves a home upon waste lands. The \"Pentonvillers\" who were suffered to land from the Royal George increased the"], [209, "THE ERA OF IMMIGRATION\u2014 1840 TO 1844. 187 work of the local police, and treated the colonists to some choice and artistic effects in the way of forgery and burglary. But there never was more than the one shipload of them disembarked. Thus Victoria never was in any sense a penal colony. The distinction so far as the present constitution of her population is concerned, is probably one only in name, for the gold excitement of a few years later must have so shaken up the people of all Australia, as to have scattered its various ingredients with tolerable uniformity through all the colonies, and in the generation that has succeeded the process of percolation must have greatly increased this tendency to uniformity. Still it has been at various times of use to the colony that she has been free from the stigma which attached in popular notions to the convict colonies. It was a great advantage that from the first the English Government looked upon the Port Phillip district as being of prime utility as a field for emigration, and that to conserve its usefulness in that way it must not be regarded as a place for convicts. To Governor Bourke we are in the first place indebted for this view that was taken of the district. In a despatch written only a month after his visit to Melbourne he states that \" the general character of the country is such as to render it a very desirable position for settlers, whether graziers or agriculturists, and there is, I think, little doubt of its soon becoming the resort of emigrants from Europe.\" His successor, Sir George Gipps, in October 1838 asked that an emigrant ship should be sent to Port Phillip with carpenters, bricklayers, smiths, and farm labourers, and that after a lapse of four or five months another should be sent with the same class of emigrants.8 Strange to say a letter from Lord Glenelg crossed this of Gipps, announcing that preparations were being made for the despatch of an emigrant vessel direct to Port Phillip. The English Government had previously to this explicitly adopted the Wakefield principle of applying the revenue arising from the sale of land in a colony to the transport of settlers to that colon)-. And already over seven thousand emigrants had landed in this manner at Sydney; but it was also the wish of the colonial office in London that the land revenue of the three districts of Sydney, Brisbane, and Melbourne should be kept separate, and that the receipts of each district should be spent in assisting emigration to that district. Now, in 1837 and 1838 the Port Phillip district had contributed over \u00a340,000 to the land revenue of New South Wales, and had not yet received a single assisted immigrant. Governor Gipps, therefore, arranged to meet the wishes of Lord John Russell by sending from Sydney some of the emigrants who had been landed there, but were willing to go to Port Phillip. Two hundred were sent over by the barque Hope in January 1839, and in the following April the ship John Barry brought two hundred more.\" It was not till the 29th of October in 1839 that the first emigrant ship from England, the David Clarke, sailed directly into Port Phillip and landed her freight of 229 immigrants, so precious to a community where there were so many employers but so few labourers ; Lord Glenelg was better than his word, for ship followed ship, about one each month\u2014 the Palmyra with 43, the William Metcalje with 230, and the Westminster with 208 persons, and thus the year 1839 saw the arrival of over eleven hundred assisted immigrants, besides fifteen hundred who came from England on their own resources. But this influx was increased in 1840, for the sale of almost \u00a360,000 worth of land in 1839 within the Port Phillip district had placed extensive means in the hands of the immigration authorities. During that year there came fifteen ships, bringing 1382 assisted immigrants to our shores, who were rapidly absorbed into the community at excellent wages. A few possessed small sums, which 8 Labilliere II. 188. * Gurner, p. 44."], [210, "188 VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. they invested in purchasing farms for themselves, though with difficulty, as the land speculators were always in force at every sale, and raised the prices beyond the legitimate value of the allotments. Yet those who waited their chance and, suffering the land mania to subside a little, bought at from twelve to fifteen shillings an acre, generally did well on their land, and ere the decade was gone were men of some little means. But it was the year 1841 which was the most notable of all in the annals of immigration to these shores. The fact that no less than \u00a3217,000 had been obtained from land sales in 1840 had quadrupled the means at the disposal of the commissioners for emigration, and the)' spent \u00a3121,000 of it in sending people to Port Phillip. In that year there came no less than forty-four vessels, bringing nearly eight thousand immigrants. This almost doubled the population, which at the beginning of the year had been ten thousand, but at the end was nearly eighteen thousand. This immigration was mostly conducted on the bounty system. The shipping companies selected the emigrants, provided them with passage, provisions, supervision, and so forth, being reimbursed by a bounty payable FIRST LANDING PIER AT SANDRIDGE. in the colony for every person safely landed on its shores. The system in the main worked well, but very differently under the management of different companies. Some of them crowded their vessels, and took, not the respectable people they were supposed to take, but the scourin\u00b0-s of the streets of London, Glasgow, and Liverpool. A considerable amount of immorality was shown by voluminous evidence to have occurred on board some of the vessels, and on more than one of them the supplies of provisions had been shamefully bad. The worst case was that of the Salsette, whose stock of fresh water failed, causing much misery among the emigrants when placed on wretchedly mean allowance. On this ship the bread was disgraceful, and much of the beef and pork unfit for food. One-twelfth part of the emigrants on the Salsette died on the passage, and of those who embarked a few months later on the Argylc one-fifth were thrown overboard. Certainly the assisted emigrant never had a rosy time of it on his voyage, and sometimes had a life of much discomfort, but on the whole the commission of inquiry into these abuses considered that the service was fairly well carried out. The arrival of these ships kept Melbourne in a lively condition during the year 1841, for they came on an average once a week ; in one memorable week there arrived four of them, bringing over a thousand"], [211, "THE ERA OF IMMIGRATION\u2014 1840 TO 1844. 189 persons.10 Single men were at once engaged, single women not so rapidly, as they were hedged round by some precautionary regulations, not being allowed to go into service on the stations unless there was a mistress to take a kindly charge of them. The married men, especially if they happened to have large families of small children, were not so much in demand for service, the squatters not caring to place them on their outstations when so encumbered. Hence, towards the end of 1841 there was a period of considerable slackness in the absorption of these married men. A depot had to be formed, the first of our Immigrant Homes, and work was found for a hundred or two during several months in making a good carriage road from the falls of the Yarra to Sandridge. But of course in a young community they were not long in finding congenial employment. There came besides these assisted immigrants, a very considerable number of settlers of a superior class, who crossed the seas on their own resources, \u2014 men of spirit and enterprise, for it was a noticeable feature of English society at that time that among the young men of the educated classes there was a restless desire to be off into the wilds of new countries and live a life of more adventure and freedom than the old world afforded. Those who came to Port Phillip rarely regretted it. Richard Howitt, the brother of William and Mary Howitt, that quaint and genial pair of writers, who so much delighted that generation of Englishmen, was amongst the immigrants in 1840, and as he was himself gifted with some little literary faculty, he has left a vivid picture of the sights and scenes that met the eye of the newcomers at that date.\" He tells how the emigrants from the old world, in search of homes in the new, landed from the confinement of long months on shipboard ; how they perfectly revelled in the fine breezy delicious atmosphere of the place ; how they gazed on Williamstown with its neat cottages, and its smart stone jetty recently erected ; on the long clean beach of Sandridge, its hotel and its wooden pier, as being the charming fringe of a land of promise. Every one was in the best of spirits, hope and novelty and the bland feeling of sociality that had sprung up on shipboard made their landing and the first few weeks a perfect picnic. They first set foot on the beach of Sandridge, and took their way along the track that led through the tea tree to the Yarra. The city then had more than a score of hotels, but so great was the stream of arrivals that it was impossible to accommodate more than a fraction of them, and therefore there was always quite an encampment to be seen on the southern side of the river. There the immigrants set up their tents opposite the little city that straggled up the hill behind the buildings of Flinders-street and Collins-street, which were beginning to look continuous. 10 The names of these vessels being closely associated with the early lives of some of our now substantial citizens, or entwined in the reminiscences our younger people have heard from their parents who came hither in them, it may be of interest to many to record their names : \u2014 iS4i.-Frankfield.

The plants, the animals of the place, and the ways of its people were all novelties, and delighted the appetite for wonder of the new arrivals. And then occasionally their camp was visited by the blacks, smeared with fat, and fully equipped in red and white ochre, grinning blandly as they asked for sixpence or for tobacco, but very willing to sing the last new comic song imported from London music halls, often made much more really comic by their broken English and lively caricatures. GOVERNOR LATROBE'S HOUSE AT JOLIMONT. Howitt was present at the Government land sale of 1840, when a number of these immigrants gathered to bid for allotments. Mr. Brodie, the Government auctioneer, stands aloft with his hammer, and behind him Captain Lonsdale, as treasurer, is ready to receive depos'ts, while close at hand are the representatives of the three banks now in the town, watching the operations, and consulting with their constituents. The general public has mustered in large numbers, sandwiches and champagne being at hand, but a very lar^e proportion have come prepared to buy, for every one is assured of the future greatness of the place, and desires land in it. The first allotment put up for sale consists of 20 acres on the way to Richmond. Latrobe has had permission from Sydney to purchase land to that extent. He bids for it the minimum price. The settlers, though keenly alive to its value,"], [213, "THE ERA OF IMMIGRATION\u2014 1840 TO 1844. 191 and competitive enough for all other blocks, refuse to bid against him, and that fine property which his Swiss wife called Jolimont falls into his possession for only a fraction of its value. And so on a slope of sunny land, well grassed, and running down to the tree-fringed bends of the Yarra, Latrobe set up the cottage, the Swiss chalet he had brought with him, and for a dozen years thereafter this was the Government-house of the colony, the centre of society, while the second house, from a social point of view, was that wooden one of two storeys, and of heavy eaves, still standing at the corner of Spring-street and Flinders-lane, which Lonsdale built for himself, out in the bush among the bronze-wing pigeons. At this sale on the 16th of June, Howitt relates that the widow of a settler recently dead wished to secure the site of the dwelling she occupied, some 60 acres in all. When she had made her modest bid, some fellow present made another higher, when Lonsdale called out seven pounds an acre for the widow, the hint was taken and the opposition ceased, the land being knocked down at a very small part of its value to assist the widow and the fatherless. A large-hearted, generous sort of style is to be noticed in the ways of these early settlers. A year before this a contractor had been building a brick shop and dwelling, and had spent \u00a3800 on it, when the ashes from a boy's pipe set it in flames, and Melbourne saw its first conflagration, the place being utterly destroyed. The contractor was liable for the loss. He was a poor man, and this was his all. The settlers at once subscribed and made good every penny of the damage. This accident had a useful result, for it caused a movement to be set on foot for the purchase of our first fire-engine. In 1841, when the population of the town was still only some five or six thousand, it had its thirteen doctors, and all of them, alas, had plenty to do. During the summer months each, on an average, saw a patient buried per week, for there raged a perfect epidemic of typhoid fever and dysentery in the warmer weather of 1840, 1841, and 1842. There were then no sewers, and the drainage of six thousand people could not stagnate for weeks in the Williams Creek, as Elizabeth-street was then called, without some serious result ; and the drainage which found its way westward made Batman's swamp worse than it had been, though always bad enough when the summer heats had nearly but not quite dried its muddy bed. Then again, the people had to drink the water of the Yarra, clear enough and pleasant to look at, but tainted by being the ultimate receptacle of the drainage of the town. It was sold in carts about the streets, two shillings being as a rule the price for eight)' gallons, though it sometimes rose to six shillings. Dearness, however, was not its worst fault ; too often it conveyed the seeds of disease. The immigrants especially suffered in this way ; after the long confinement and not peculiarly suitable fare of their voyage they rapidly fell victims to this early insalubrity of Melbourne. It was in February 1841 that there came the Salsette, which had left England laden with men and women full of high hopes and eager to try their fortune under skies of a brighter omen ; but the miseries of their long voyage in a ship badly found by sordid proprietors, had taken the stamina out of them. They landed in a weakened condition unlikely to resist the attack of disease, and the typhoid which then was raging in Melbourne at once seized upon them as congenial food. Latrobe, in an official report, stated that they had most of them been engaged before leaving the ship, but few had had time to enter on their duties when they were prostrate with the deadly fever that from that time to this has always been a well-known visitant in Melbourne in the months of February and March. One by one the unfortunate people from the Salsette became languid and out of sorts ; their pulses steadily rose to raging fever heat, and the scourge was upon them, then known z Vol. I."], [214, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 192 as low fever, but now familiar as the dreaded typhoid. Having reached the distant shore afar from home and kindred, they found themselves on a sick bed, in rooms where the temperature was no\u00b0, where strangers nursed them in their delirium, and where busy doctors popped in only to shake their heads and make pretence of cheeriness, while they well knew that hope was gone or going. So the cemetery at the top of Queen-street rapidly filled, and before long it had its eight hundred graves. As Howitt observes, it was a solemn place to enter, where one saw inscribed on every hand the names of men and women so recently warm with the bounding pulse of hope in the prospect of new and prosperous homes, whose fever-smitten bodies found only a chilly resting-place in the land they had come so far to seek. Thereupon Latrobe appointed our first Board of Health to inquire into the causes of this mortality. It was mostly due to the unsanitary condition of Melbourne. Clearly the place must have a corporation to take heed to these things, to levy rates, and raise money wherewith to effect the needful works. There was no great difficulty in having this incorporation carried out; for the Colonial Office, then the final and only arbiter for all things Australasian, had in 1837 adopted a fixed policy of permitting, nay, even recommending the incorporation of towns when they had reached a population of two thousand persons. This policy had been proclaimed when the colonists of South Australia were busy with theories and speculations as to constitutions and forms of Government, and under it Adelaide had already been incorporated a city in 1840. The people of Melbourne had now only to ask the same boon, and it was granted. But they belonged to New South Wales, and the act of incorporation had to be the work of the Legislative Council of that colony. In its action it displayed a very satisfactory promptness. It was only at the end of 1840 that the first hint was given by the local papers of a wish for municipal institutions; and yet the bill to grant this desire was read a first time on 10th Ma)-, 1842, on the same day when a bill was introduced to incorporate the inhabitants of the town of Sydney. The many alterations required in the latter caused both bills to be deferred from week to week, but at last, on 12th August 1842, the \"Melbourne Municipal Corporation Act\" was duly passed by the Council at Sydney \u2014 only five years after the first land sale in the place. The Preamble stated that the inhabitants of the town and their successors shall be constituted a body corporate and politic under the title of \" mayor, aldermen, councillors, and burgesses of the town of Melbourne.\" The third clause directed that the town should be divided into four wards, to be called respectively Gipps Ward, Bourke Ward, Latrobe Ward, and Lonsdale Ward. In the first of these wards was included that rapidly growing suburb of Newtown, otherwise called \" Collingwood.\" The ninth clause directed the mayor of the town to set up durable boundary marks for the several wards, and to perambulate these boundaries every three years to prevent any alteration in their situation. The enrolment of burgesses was much restricted ; none could attain that enviable distinction save those who occupied a house of the value of \u00a325 a year, or who occupied a shop or warehouse of that value, and did not live more than seven miles out of the town boundary. Section 76 empowered the town council to provide lamps for the streets of the town, and to light them with gas or oil as it deemed most suitable. The formation and repair of all \"public roads, lanes, streets, highways, and passages\" was placed \" wholly under the management and control of the said council.\" And truly some such provision was wanted. For the streets were then in a deplorable condition. In 1840 Flinders-street was a bog of rich adhesive black mud lying between a row of houses and shops on one hand, and on the other that dense tea-tree scrub which lined the river bank. The winter rains made this so formidable that the residents subscribed eighty"], [215, "THE ERA OF IMMIGRATION\u2014 1840 TO 1844. 193 pounds for a tentative effort at its improvement, and a month later a society was formed to furnish and canvass for subscriptions to make a decent road through Collingwood, and out to the Plenty River. Ten days later the efforts of private citizens secured the re-opening of Collins-street for traffic, the bullock drays during the wet weather of July having so cut it up that on several occasions before it was abandoned for vehicles, carts had become so deeply involved in its composition of black dough that six, eight, and ten bullocks had tugged at them in vain, and only by the union of a couple of teams could they be hauled up from the bottom of -the road. In the winter of 1841 Bourke-street is described as being a series of gullies, rivulets, ponds, and bogs, and it had a number of well-known stumps, distinguished by special names, whereon the smartly driven gigs for which Melbourne was beginning to be celebrated had gone to pieces to the number of at least a score; and three or four serious accidents had attended these mishaps. But Elizabeth-street was the standing grievance. Though called a street, it was a creek \u2014 dry in dry weather, but after a day of rain, flowing with a formidable current. On many occasions the town was divided into two isolated portions, for when this creek was flowing bank high there was no means of crossing it, and foolhardy people who attempted the dangerful adventure were swept, horse and vehicle, or bullocks and dray, downward to the Yarra. On most occasions they were saved, there being always help at hand, but one or two fatal occurrences took place after this fashion. The bulk of the citizens were wiser, and if an evening set in wet and stormy, no matter how attractive the concerts, no matter how gay the ball on one side of Elizabeth-street, those dwelling on the other side contented themselves at home, and did not tempt their fate across the furious waters. But even in dry weather there was generally a pond at the corner of Collins and Elizabeth streets, and there lay the formidable gulf which the Melbourne citizen in his indignant moods loved to quote as the most flagrant instance of Government neglect. And yet the authorities in Sydney did not wholly forget the town. In the winter of 1841 the Legislative Council had voted a thousand pounds for the formation of a wharf along the edge of Flinders-street for nearly two miles. About six months later it was ready for the berthing of small craft up to two hundred tons or so, and also of the two or three small steamers that were now regularly trading up the Yarra, such as the Aphrasia, a paddle steamer, the first that provided steam communication with Geelong, and the Sea Horse, the first that was laid on as a regular trader from Melbourne to Sydney; the Vesta and the Governor Arthur, which sailed between Melbourne and Williamstown. But though the Government when roused to action did often spasmodically enter upon vigorous measures, the civic affairs of Melbourne were left to private enterprise, and consequently were badly done. In the matter of cleansing the city and disposing of refuse, absolutely no provision was made, and the festive champagne-drinkers were responsible for so large an amount of broken glass on the chief public streets as to make them dangerous for man and beast. Hence the pleasure, probably never since repeated, with which the citizens hailed the election of the first town councillors on Thursday, 1st of December, 1842. That was a day of revelry. In each of the four wards the tables were spread by the rival candidates, and the voters streamed in all day long for an hourly meal apiece, accompanied, as is usual, with such a drinking of healths as ought, if there were any efficacy in it, to have set the sanitary condition of the city on a sound footing for years. The most popular candidate was Henry Condell, one of the two brewers of the town. His ale was well esteemed, and being free for all comers, the consumption was amazing. There was, however, no disorder; though the"], [216, "194 VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. unlimited supply of drink for the labouring classes, even those who had no votes, resulted in a night of desperate intoxication. The day was kept as a holiday, and round the three or four bands of music, which the candidates provided to pipe and drum, but chiefly to drum, all day, good-humoured crowds lounged and bantered, enjoying the excitement of Melbourne's first election.'-' Nearly the whole of the seven hundred bur gesses voted. Those of Gipps Ward returned Henry Condell, John Dixon and George Beaver ; for Bourke Ward there were elected John Thomas Smith, William Kerr, and John Patterson; for Latrobe Ward, Andrew Russell, George James, and D. S. Campbell ; while the chosen of Lonsdale Ward were John Pascoe Fawkner, William H. Mortimer, and John Orr; most of whom were \"chaired\" or else carried shoulder high to their homes. A week later these councillors pro ceeded to the election of four of their number as aldermen, the successful candidates being Henry Condell, the brewer of Lonsdale-street ; William Kerr, the editor of the Port Phillip Gazette; Andrew Russell, and W. H. Mortimer, a popular butcher of Collins-street. At the same meeting they pro ceeded to the election of a mayor, and their choice fell on Henry Condell, who therefore bore the distinction of being the HENRY CONDELL, THE FIRST MAYOR OK MELBOURNE. first mayor of Melbourne. By direction of Sir George Gipps he was styled the \"Worshipful,\" and took rank in the community next to the Superintendent. On the following day his worship, at the head of the council, walked in procession from the hired room in Collins-street where the council met, to the court-house, near the corner of King and Bourke streets, and there took the oaths of his office. And so Melbourne was thenceforth an incorporated town, with a mayor to rule in civic matters and give its citizens an annual ball, the first of those popular dances taking place in July 1844, when five hundred folks in fancy dress, with an excellent band, and in a brilliant hall, whirled to the rustle of silks and satins and rich brocades, where just nine years before Batman had looked across that landscape of primeval woodlands. But the Town Council, though not averse from enjoyment, was also eager for work, and busy were the plans that were proposed and discussed in that little room in Collins-street ; the roads must be repaired, and among a score of other improvements a bridge of stout hardwood beams was thrown over Elizabeth-street in the line of Little Flinders-streets, so as to be passable for vehicles in all weathers ; water must be supplied, and schemes were asked for by which the water of the Yarra could be pumped up without returning to the citizens any of the drainage with which they had infected its current. There must be a town hall ; its site was a matter in which, as usual, a score of people offered different opinions, and each one stoutly maintained the foolishness of all but his own. Two positions, however, found most savour with the public\u2014 one upon the Eastern Hill, the other next to the Post Office, a wooden building with broad verandahs, which at this time was being built at the corner of Bourke and Elizabeth streets on the site now occupied by the handsome Post Office of our own days. There, in those days, a postmaster and three clerks scarcely sufficed to overtake the postal arrangements which five years before had been managed by Skene Craig behind his counter. The second meeting of the Town Council is described as being \" inharmonious,\" ,: The Garryowen Sketches, p. 47."], [217, "THE ERA OF IMMIGRATION\u2014 1840 TO 1844. 195 probably due to the fact that the erection of a town hall must enhance the value of somebody's allotments, and the difficult question to settle was whose allotments these were to be. The final choice of the present site was not made without many bickerings. But on the whole it was a most useful Town Council, and though there was something to criticise, and it was freely criticised, there can be no doubt that the civic fathers of the city, assisted by an energetic Town Clerk, Mr. J. C. King, soon made a vast improvement upon the appearance of the streets of Melbourne, and that with only very moderate rates, rarely exceeding eightpence in the pound. One of the earliest subjects that attracted its attention was the fact that there was no bridge across the Yarra, and that all approach to the town from the south side was over a punt ; this was an arrangement always awkward, and often dangerous when the river was a swollen mass of tumbling waters. The necessity of providing a bridge was first urged in April 1840, and in the same month the company which owned the punts across the river reformed itself into the \" Melbourne Bridge Company,\" with a capital of \u00a35000 in shares of forty pounds each, for the purpose of erecting an iron suspension bridge. Mr. J. A. Manton, a civil engineer in the town, tendered for the erection of such a structure for \u00a34500, to be completed in sixteen months, but the project fell SITE OF THE PRESENT ANGLICAN CATHEDRAL, MELBOURNE, IN I***-*.:*..

The property-holders of Elizabeth-street and those of Swanston-street formed two parties, each working for its own interests, and when a meeting was held to decide this critical question there was no great majority, nineteen votes being cast for the Elizabeth-street line and eighteen for the foot of Swanston-street. And so the people of Melbourne were still under the necessity of using one or other of the two punts which plied over the Yarra at the time when the corporation came into existence. But about a year later it became known that the Sydney Government was not unlikely at some early date to spend some of the local land funds in building a handsome bridge in the line of Swanston-street; it was then resolved to place there a temporary wooden bridge of trestles, to serve for the four or five years that must elapse ere the substantial erection of bluestone could be completed. Tenders and plans were at once called for, and four hundred pounds were spent on a structure 120 feet in length with a"], [218, "196 VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. roadway of seventeen feet wide and a footway of sour feet additional on one side of it. This the first bridge that ever spanned the Yarra, was opened for traffic in October 1845. But by that time the authorities at Sydney had shaped their plans into working order. Ten thousand pounds were to be spent on a single handsome arch, simple, but bold and graceful. To carry out the work an engineer, well skilled in bridge construction, Mr. David Lennox, was brought out from the old country, for this was to be the first important bridge of Australia. The early part of the year 1846 was occupied in preliminary arrangements, but at length on the 20th of March in that year the town became conspicuously gay on the occasion of the laying of the foundation-stone for this the first undertaking of national moment that the rising colony had witnessed. Latrobe was to lay the stone, but the eclat of the ceremony was due to the Freemasons, who graced the day with all the honours of their order. Melbourne had at an early date taken an interest in Freemasonry, and the Lodge of Australia Felix had been enrolled on the 25th March, 1S40. In 1841 it was in full working efficiency with a hundred members. It now, in 1846, had a goodly muster to join the procession with silk aprons and gloriously tinted scarves, and wands, and signs, and symbols, meaning much to the initiated, but only delighting the profane eye with their gorgeous tints and mysterious import. Collins-street was now a tolerably continuous line of warehouses from Oueen-street to Swanston-street, boasting one jeweller's shop of pawnbroking aspect, and dignified by a couple of cabs for hire. All the shops were shut, and each displayed whatever flags the place could supply. Down this holiday street the procession marched with a band of vigorous trumpets in front, and the Freemasons two and two behind. His ITonour the Superintendent and the dignitaries of the place succeeded, and a line of trade societies with floating banners closed the display. The procession turned down Swanston-street, and formed by the river's bank to see the stone well and truly laid. The name assigned to the bridge was in honour of that chubby little fellow of four years old whom his royal mother, the girl-queen, was then fondling in the bliss of newly-wedded life. But the Freemasons had more to do on that busy 20th of March 1846. They were to assist in laying the foundation-stone also of the Melbourne ITospital in Lonsdale-street. As early as 1840 the want of hospital accommodation had been felt. Shepherds in town knocking down their cheques were too often in the habit of also knocking each other down, or they fell into Elizabeth-street, or otherwise smashed their limbs and fractured their skulls ; wretched aboriginals were sometimes picked up in the outskirts of the town in a woful condition after a free fight following a debauch; immigrants were often stricken with fever in a new land where they had no friends. The result of a little agitation was that before the end of 1840 a small place, once the police station, had been temporarily fitted up with ten beds. This was maintained by voluntary subscriptions, and by the proceeds from occasional balls, picnics, amateur performances, pleasure trips, and so forth, which certainly provided funds, but always a little less than what were wanted. But after the municipal institutions were in full working order, the Sydney Government was more easily moved, and in July 1845 a site was chosen in Lonsdale-street, a pleasant spot on the outskirts of the city, and a month or two later a gang of men were engaged in filling up and levelling the half block granted by Government for that purpose. On this festive 20th of March 1846, after the foundation-stone had been laid of the Prince's Bridge, the Freemasons in procession walked up Swanston-street to the hospital site thus prepared, and there Dr. Palmer, the third mayor of Melbourne, laid the foundation-stone of that great institution, in presence of a dense crowd of citizens."], [219, "THE ERA OF IMMIGRATION. -1840 TO 1844. 197 A matter which early engaged the attention of the City Council in so warm a climate was the erection of public baths; an application was received from a private person in November 1843 for permission to establish swimming baths on the Yarra opposite the Custom House; and towards the close of the following January the first public baths of Victoria were thrown open to the people free of charge for two days. But in spite of that liberal effort to attract custom the venture did not thrive ; the citizens of Melbourne preferred to pay their half-crown each for a place in Fred. Liardet's omnibus, which took them down to the clean crisp sand of the sea beach at Sandridge, where a dip in the sparkling brine was more to their taste. So the baths were abandoned a year or two after. There were few of the institutions of a great city which Melbourne did not possess before the end of 1847. First in order came the School of Arts and Mechanics' Institute, founded in November 1839, whilst the town was yet very young. Its president was Captain Lonsdale, its vice-presidents the Rev. J. Clow and Dr. Farquhar M'Crae, and among the committee were Redmond Barry, John Caulfield, D. C. Macarthur, George Beaver, J. M. Chisholm, and Thomas Strode. The Rev. T. H. Osborne acted as honorary secretary, and Thomas Burns undertook the duties of librarian, while Dr. Wilkie volunteered for the task of gathering and arranging our first museum, which was to be connected with the little institution. A temporary wooden building was erected in the beginning of 1S40, and on the 16th of April in that year the inaugural address was delivered in it. In it also throughout that winter there was given a course of lectures by some of the professional men of the town. The first was delivered by Redmond Barry. This lively young Irish barrister, having found it difficult to make a start in Dublin, had emigrated to Australia. On landing in Sydney he was admitted to the bar there, and hearing of the flourishing place that was growing up at Port Phillip he had taken his passage for Melbourne, where he arrived on the 13th of November 1839, a day always afterwards kept sacred by him in hospitable fashion as the luckiest day of his life. Only a few months after his arrival he commenced his public career in the colony by giving the first lecture of the new Mechanics' Institute, his subject being the \" Art of Agriculture.\" How he came to be an authority upon that art it is difficult to say, but it was certainly a very useful subject for a young community. He first of all offered a quarter of an hour of speculations as to the kind of agriculture carried on by Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. Having exhausted that topic he spent an hour in an elaborate disquisition on the agriculture of the ancients, with cheerful extracts from Strabo and Virgil. To the end there was nothing said about the agriculture of modern days, but an eloquent exhortation was given to those present to study this useful art, and in conclusion the lecturer, warmly complimenting his audience on the country that had fallen to their lot, prophesied for it a great and prosperous future. Next month there came a lecture on colonisation, and in June one by that youthful journalist, Mr. Arden, on the \" Mechanical Agency of the Press,\" and in the following month the citizens of Melbourne gathered to hear the intrepid explorer, Captain Sturt, who was then on a visit from Adelaide, deliver a lecture on \" Australian Geography and Geology.\" And so from month to month until October the citizens of Melbourne gathered to hear the first culture-lectures of the town. The institution throve, and in 1841 it had 241 members. The committee then purchased that piece of land in Collins-street where now the Athen\u00e6um stands, the same institution, but under a different name. On that site in 1842 a stone building was erected, which, though poor enough to the eyes of a generation later, was then one of the half-dozen features which woke the architectural pride of the citizens. It was a most useful place in a young community, a worth)-"], [220, "198 VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. forerunner of the Public Library, the University, and the Museums that form our pride in a later day. Its large hall and its smaller rooms, being let for various purposes, were also useful in many ways. It was in one of those smaller rooms that the Melbourne Town Council met for several years after its formation, until it had a hall of its own. The floor of the large hall was good for dancing upon, and once a quarter the assembly balls of the place \u2014 gay affairs according to the inhabitants, dull provincial performances according to the new arrival fresh from London \u2014 were held with unfailing vigour. Balls given by the bachelors to the married men, by the squatters of the West to the ladies of Melbourne, by the gentlemen of Sydney to the elite of Port Phillip, and so forth, kept the hall of the Mechanics' Institute in frequent request. Music was in very early days a delight of the folks of Melbourne. The first musical society was inaugurated on the ioth of July 1840, and it styled itself the \"Philharmonic,\" but it was not till the end of 1845 that it was able to furnish the community with a concert of high class music. The first really ambitious effort of this sort took place two years earlier, in January 1843, when Mr. Clarke, who was then the leading professional musician in the town, gathered the local talent to do honour to the opening of the first Melbourne organ in the fine Wesleyan church that had recently been built at the corner of Collins and Queen streets. Governor Latrobe and his lady were present, and for the first occasion of so long and honourable a series the works of Handel, Haydn and Mozart rolled out their solid harmonies from a fairly numerous chorus, whom Mr. Clarke had laboriously trained by that system then called Wilhelm's, but now known to us as Hullah's. So brisk and gay a community could not long exist without a theatre. The first efforts to obtain a license in 1840 were fruitless, but in July 1841 Mr. Faction, the licensee of the Theatre Royal in Sydney and Hobart, obtained permission to open premises in Melbourne ; ere long however the license was withdrawn, as the proceedings were not orderly enough to please the authorities. Then an amateur committee, re gretting that the delights of the drama should be lost to the citizens because of the drunken frolics of ex-convicts, leased the building, took out a license on their own responsibility, and as they held the place solely for amusement and not for profit, the Royal Victoria Theatre in Bourke-street became favourably known for enter tainments of a quiet and select description, \"Rob Roy\" being the first piece produced under their direction. But the first theatre of any preten sions was the Queen's theatre, in Queen-street built in October, 1843 ; and the local papers declare that for scenery and equipment, for acting and management, this little theatre equalled what was then to be found, as a rule, in pro vincial England, though as a rule the theatre could only afford two performances per week. There the sorrows of \"Oliver Twist,\" the drolleries of the popular Lee as \"Billy Barlow,\" and the absurdities of \" Pligh Life Below Stairs,\" enter-"], [221, "THE ERA OF IMMIGRA TION- 1840 TO 1844. 199 taincd the busy settlers in their hours of relaxation. But when the ambition of the theatrical people soared to opera, their success was not proportionate. The first opera ever performed was \"La Sonnambula\" in April 1846, but the critics of the press sternly rebuked the presumption which murdered with inadequate resources what the taste of that age regarded as the priceless gem of the lyric drama. Those years, from 1840 to 1845, were busy with the formation of societies and companies. Early in 1839 there came the first of our great insurance companies, the Melbourne Fire and Marine Insurance Company. Its prospectus was issued in April 1839; the Company was formed in May, with a capital of \u00a350,000, and the business opened on the first of July. On this day our first local bank issued its pro spectus \u2014 the Melbourne and Port Phillip Bank \u2014 afterwards known as the Port Phillip Bank, with a capital of \u00a360,000 in \u00a340 shares. The shares, with five pounds paid-up, were rapidly bought, and under the management of John Gardiner who before taking to the rearing of cattle at Toorak had been a banker in Tasmania, the little institu tion at first throve well enough, and a year later declared a dividend of 12 per cent, with a surplus of \u00a369 12s. Two other institutions of the same kind appeared in the field, the Tradesmen's Bank, in April 1840, and the Scotch OLD UNION BANK, MELBOURNE. Australian Bank in January 1841 ; but they never got beyond the initial stage. The little town was already well supplied ; for besides the local bank, there were two branches of powerful English institutions. The Lmion Bank had in 1840 erected a fine two-story building, quite a spacious place of four and twenty windows, at the corner of Collins and Queen streets, while D. C. Macarthur, of the Bank of Australasia, had in the same year transferred his business to a new building, equally remarkable, considering the youth of the place. The Melbourne and Port Phillip paid another dividend, and then decided to discontinue business, the public being at no loss, but the condition of the shareholders being not so favourable. Numerous shipping companies and steampacket associations showed that Melbourne in 1842 had been seized by the mania then raging in the commercial world. Of more direct public value was the Pastoral and Agricultural Society, which held its inaugural dinner on 16th January 1840, the president being Mr. William Mackenzie, of Kinlochewe, and the vice-president Dr. Farquhar McCrae. Among the directors were the Rev. J. Clow, Captain McLachlan, Captain George Brunswick Smyth, Captain Baxter, Dr. Alexander Thomson, John Hawdon, James Simpson, F. A. Powlett, W. F. A. Rucker, D. S. Campbell, John Aitken, Major Mercer, and Peter Snodgrass. Under the direction of its busy secretaries, Andrew McCrae and William Kerr this society prepared and successfully carried out the first exhibition ever held in Victoria. It was in the month of March 1840, and from that date onward the annual show of the Society was held at Melbourne and at Geelong in alternate years. What with companies and institutions, churches, schools, and banks, the town was rapidly Vol. I. 2 A"], [222, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 200 assuming the look of a little metropolis. The Government had built extensive barracks in 1843 at the corner of Bourke and Spencer streets, and there had been fixed the head-quarters of a regiment, so that the people could now enjoy a little military parade on special occasions ; and uniforms became a daily source of brightness when the weather was fine along the smartest section of Collins-street. The police were more numerous, and patrolled the streets in a uniform of dark blue and silver; and in 1842 a volunteer corps of yeomanry for a time added the glamour of a cavalry troop to the martial glories of the place. In 1 841 there appeared also the town markets of Melbourne, to the great delight of everybody. They had first been proposed in 1840, but it was not till 15th December 1841 that they were completed and thrown open to the public. The first markets were on the Western Hill, on part of that reserve which had been left for public purposes behind the Custom House, but as the city moved steadily eastward those who dwelt in that direction began to find the distance troublesome, and in June 1846 they petitioned for another market upon the brow of the Eastern Hill The merchants of the town formed themselves into a Commercial Exchange in August 1841, the president being J. B. Were, and the vice-president John Porter, with George Arden, James Cain, D. S. Campbell, William Kerr, John Orr, Alexander Andrew, G. W. Cole, George Cavanagh, Andrew Russell, and William Locke among the committee. Signalling arrangements were made at their request, but at Government expense, on a mast erected on Flagstaff Hill. There floated the flags by which signals could be sent to Williamstown, and what was generally a much more exciting matter, at that post were received from Williamstown the flag signals that indicated the arrival of vessels from Europe with news of what was going on in the great world without. In 1 84 1 the people had their first botanic gardens. A certain Mr. Bunce arrived and proposed that, if allowed twenty-five acres of land rent free, he would turn them into a pleasure ground for the community, he being permitted to sell the produce of four or five acres, which he would convert into a market garden. In some such humble way the fine gardens on the St. Kilda road had their origin. What was there that a small metropolis should have that Melbourne was then without ? There was a fine building at the foot of Queen-street to do duty as a set of Government offices. For a couple of years Latrobe had used Batman's house on the Western Hill for that purpose, but now the structure which looked out on the Yarra, a square stone building, with two porches, and a roof with heavy eaves, was reckoned an ornament to the town. In July 1842 the Freemasons had attended in all their splendour to see the foundation laid of a new court-house, to cost \u00a34000 in its erection. It now presented a respectable appearance, and in the court that met there our first judge presided \u2014 Jud\"*e Willis \u2014 an honest, stubbornly upright, elderly gentleman, in silk stockings and old-world fashions, elaborately polite while all went well, fiery looking about the eyes when matters deviated a trifle in their course from what he thought proper, and overwhelmingly violent when the storm burst forth. Then beginning every sentence with a \" Sir,\" like thunder, he frightened witnesses and jurymen till they were glad to be out of his presence. There were four barristers pleading in his court \u2014 James Croke, who acted as Crown prosecutor, and Redmond Barry and William Foster Stawcll and Edward E. Williams, all men much younger than the judge, who never shrank from giving them a fatherly lecture in open court. One was too much given to racing, according to the judge, another was guilty of the foppery of wcarin\u00b0 a moustache, a third was known occasionally to make payments not in cash but in bills. The judge, in short, set them down as fast young men, whom it was necessary to brino- to"], [223, "THE ERA OF IMMIGRATION\u2014 1840 TO 1844. 201 reason, while they very naturally resented this interference with their private affairs. Then the judge became possessed of an idea that Captain Lonsdale and Mr. James Simpson had been guilty of dishonest practices while acting as executors of John Batman, the suspicion being, so far as we can now learn, quite unfounded ; and as in these and a dozen other cases he never sailed to express his feelings with most intemperate words, a strong antipathy began to gather against him.'3 The Port Phillip Gazette spoke out strongly against him, and gave reports of his arbitrary and exasperating conduct in court. The judge called up the youthful editor, Arden, before him, lectured him, fined him, imprisoned him. The position of the judge then became a warm one. He, however, cared very little for that, being a man who, conscious of his own uprightness of intention, could not for the life of him understand how anybody should fail to see things as he saw them. At length the matter came to a crisis. Lonsdale privately called a meeting of a few of those most exasperated against the choleric judge. They met in the Royal Hotel, prepared a round robbin, each signed it, and quietly carried it to a few friends who also put their names to it, and so a goodly requisition of more than 500 persons went to Sydney urgently desiring Governor Gipps to recall the cause of their uneasiness, and this petition was backed by a private letter from Latrobe to Gipps. Now Willis had been a judge for some time in Sydney, and had quarrelled with most people there, including all his brother judges and also Gipps himself. Hence there was a prompt answer in the form of a summary suspension of the judge. Willis was taking his seat in court one morning when he had to suffer the indignity of having the letter of suspension placed in his hands without warning, and to endure the ignominy of adjourning the court in presence of exulting enemies. But those who had not come into personal contact with the judge regarded this proceeding as extremely unfair. What ! said they, dismiss a man without the least chance of defending himself! Accept as absolute truth a private document drawn up by men, actuated, who can tell by what motives ! Hear nothing that could be said on the other side! Such a method of treating a British judge seemed monstrous, and the Mechanics' Institute Hall was crowded on the occasion of a meeting, presided over by Dr. Augustus Grecves, to express sympathy with him. And on the 13th of July when he embarked at the Queen's Wharf in the little river steamer that was to place him on board the Glenbervie to proceed to England, a company of four hundred bade him farewell. When he reached London a long appeal case began before the Privy Council, which, after three years of litigation, resulted in Gipps's conduct being upheld, the charges against the poor old judge being clearly proven. Willis then sent in his resignation. Earl Grey said that had he done so three years earlier, and saved the expense and annoyance of this long appeal case, he would have accepted his resignation. But as he had fought the matter to the bitter end he must accept the consequence of defeat, and so the eccentric judge had to suffer the ignominy of a public dismissal from his post.\" There were, however, doubts as to whether a Governor could of his own authority dismiss a judge, and on the strength of this doubt Willis received three years' arrears of pay, amounting to \u00a35000. He was succeeded by Mr. Justice Jeffcott, an Irish barrister, who was then practising in New South Wales, but after holding the appointment for a year and giving great satisfaction to the community, he retired and returned to his native country. Then came Mr. Justice Therry in 1845, a gentlemanly judge with no great ability but plenty of good sense. He also held the position for only one year, 13 M'Combie's History of Victoria, p 102. \" House of Commons Papers."], [224, "202 VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. when a more lucrative judgeship took him back to Sydney. Before he left the town the new judge assumed control of the court, Mr. Justice a'Beckett, in whom the judicial powers were vested for a much longer period. In 1845 Melbourne, with a population of over ten thousand people, had taken rank as the second place in Australia, being already of more importance than either Hobart or Launceston, and much in front of Adelaide both in population and in resources, though the two had been founded in the same year. It had even begun to be, in a mild way, a place of some manufactures, there being two or three large flour mills, the most notable that erected by a man named Dight, at the falls which since then have borne his name. He brought a shipload of bricks all the way from Launceston to build his place in the -midst of bluestone rocks, for it was not till shortly after his arrival that some wiseacre, more inventive than his fellows, discovered that bluestone could be cut and dressed, and that it made famous building material. There were also several sawmills at work in the town, the first having been started with a pair of marine engines, which the owner of a steamer landed and BOURKE STREET, MELBOURNE, IN THE \"FORTIES turned to more profitable account in sawing up the native timber. But perhaps the most notable place in the way of manufacture was the foundry started by two enterprising engineers, named Robert Langlands and Thomas Fulton. Their shop, at the foot of King-street, rapidly became a busy place, for there was much ironwork wanted for bullock teams, waggons, wool presses, and so forth ; and the papers chronicle with exultation the casting of the two first lamp-posts, which are declared to be most excellent of their kind. The first steamer built in Melbourne was a little wooden thing, named the Fairy Queen, launched on the 8th of April, 1 84 1, but there was much more pride a year later, when three thousand persons gathered to see Langlands and Fulton launch their first iron vessel, the Vesta, the second that was ever built in Australia. She was 109 feet long and of sixty tons burthen, and for years traded betwixt Melbourne and Williamstown, besides acting as the river-tug. Nay, the town had risen to the"], [225, "THE ERA OF IMMIGRATION\u2014 1840 TO 1844. 203 dignity of producing a book. It appeared in December 1841, the work of George Arden, the editor os the Port Phillip Gazette. The copy in the Public Library shows it to have been a well-written book, neatly enough printed, and extending to 118 pages, by no means a humble forerunner of the publishing activity of Melbourne. Indeed, in almost every department of enterprise this infant city was surprisingly busy and hopeful. Perhaps the story of its first town clock would tell a little in the other direction. In the very early part of 1S40 the citizens had decided that a town clock was a convenience they must have, and so in their lively way a meeting was called, and the \u00a365 necessary were at once subscribed. The town clock was bought in a month or so, and it was thought that it might go on the top of the new Custom House, which was then being built at the foot of Queen-street. But the design of the place had not contemplated a clock, and the plans, which had been drawn in the Sydney office, could not be altered to suit the whims of a few folks who had bought a clock ; so the unwieldy timekeeper was ignominiously locked away in the police-office, where it rested for a year and a half, till the Government completed the new post-office at the corner of Bourke and Elizabeth streets, when a niche was formed for the town clock, and the business men of the city were at rest. There, where all could see, was the public authority as to the time of day, and when public appointments had to be made, there was no longer the spectacle afforded by half a-dozen obstinate authorities, each maintaining the correctness of his own watch against all and every comer. In short Melbourne, by the end of 1845, had almost everything that a well-conducted town ought to have ; and with every thousand immigrants that landed on her shores her dignity, her bustle, had increased. But the influx of immigrants at length died out. It depended wholly on the receipts obtained by the sale of land ; for the British Government was resolute in refusing to spend any British money in the process ; but the land sales had been killed by the land speculators, and the receipts had rapidly dwindled away. In 1840 they had been close upon \u00a3220,000 ; next year they were less than a quarter of that sum. In 1842 they were reduced to \u00a321,000; in 1843. to \u00a38000; while in 1844 they did not even amount to \u00a31000. Accordingly, the numbers of immigrants fell off in the same proportion. In 1S42 there were less than four thousand, in 1S43 and 1844 they still continued to dwindle; till in 1845 only a single vessel was despatched from England with assisted immigrants, and with her the tide of arrivals came to a close ; that tide of immigration had, in all, brought nearly twenty thousand people to our shores, large numbers of them the right stuff for the making of colonies ; and their advent had changed a community of ten thousand persons into one of thirty thousand in the course of five years. We in Victoria are generally too little aware how much our colony owes to this full and generous stream of brawny arms and hopeful hearts. It was a process of beneficent results for Victoria. Alas that its close should have been marked by so sad a calamity! Of the hundred ships and more that had borne these people to our shores, all had reached their destination safely. Their voyages had been mostly long and tedious, but without disaster. It was reserved for the last to remind the voyagers that there were perils of the deep which they had escaped. This ill-fated Cataraqui, the last of the long line, had sailed from Liverpool with over 400 emigrants, but only nine of them ever reached our shores. After a long but fairly prosperous voyage she was close to her destination; another day would see her safely anchored in Port Phillip, and the emigrants were preparing for their landing on those new shores and for quitting that four months' life of berth, and cabin, and crowded deck for the fresh life beneath"], [226, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 204 an Australian sky. But there was one night to pass by; just one night. That Sunday night, however, was one of total darkness, a thickly-clouded sky of gloom above them, and a fresh gale with roughly-following billows behind. The captain, being uncertain of his reckoning, hove to, but the surgeon, anxious to land his charges at once, lest the outburst of any epidemic might diminish his bounty money, insisted on the setting of the sails, and the captain weakly gave way. And so they plunged straight on for King's Island, and in the dead of that winter's night the vessel flung herself in full career on a reef lying off the shore ; in a minute she was smothered in the lashing foam of the waves that urged on from behind and swept her decks. Those upon the deck who had not been quick enough to seize some object of sufficient security were borne headlong onward upon the foam to perish in the surf that lay between the ship and the blackness in front, which told of a high and precipitous shore. The ship below was densely crowded, family after family packed away in tiers of berths. The bows of the vessel being burst open, the waters poured in like a flood and drowned the people in their berths, or overtook the poor mothers while seeking to gather their little ones together. Others, apparently a little more fortunate, were in time to climb the stairs and there poured forth a stream of affrighted people out upon the deck, many of them to be instantly borne away by the sweeping breakers, and their shrieks, carried forth into the churning gloom, curdled the blood of those that kept their hold upon the rails. For a couple of hours they held their places on the heavily-bumping ship, and then the dawn began to break, slowly and sullenly. They were some distance from a cliffy shore, wild, forbidding, uninhabited. There was no human being in sight to render any aid or bring any assistance, and so as day wore on they clung to the vessel which was steadily heeling over. No boat could cross the intervening space of jagged rocks and rushing breakers. Their only hope was to carry a hawser ashore and to take the survivors over the wild jumble of surge. They got up four coils of rope with extreme difficulty from the battered hold of the ship, and for hour after hour did they try their utmost to carry one end of it safely ashore ; but every effort was in vain ; no swimmer could baffle the fury of the fast-succeeding rollers. The captain tried to cheer the hearts of his people by assuring them that he would yet get them all safely ashore, but when the evening closed in early after a day of distress, with weeping women and moaning children crouching behind whatever shelter could be improvised; when it became certain that another night of similar horror must pass over, all hope was lost ; as death became more certain so the noises and lamentations of families huddled together behind tarpaulins and to leeward of the deck-cabins died away, and darkness stole on. A night so dreary that no words can suggest its utter misery, crept on from hour to hour, to the dismal sound of crashing waves, and the shriek of wind-gusts overhead, and the bumping and crunching of the timbers upon the rock beneath ; and whilst a second day was dawning, at a sudden jolt the vessel parted amidships and dissolved beneath the feet of the emigrant families. Their sorrows were quickly over in that gulf of foam and tossing seaweed, and the cold eye of a chilly daybreak saw the lifeless gaze of long rows of faces strewn betwixt sea and shore. Over sour hundred thus met their doom in this, the first vessel that crashed upon the inhospitable shores of King's Island, though since then there has been a long and fatal array of them. Only nine survivors, most of them members of the crew, were left alive to drag their stiff and aching limbs over the rough island to a settler who had his home there, .and eventually they found their way to Melbourne, the last of that great stream of"], [227, "THE ERA OF IMMIGRATION\u2014 1840 TO 1844. 205 immigration which had trebled the population of the colony and effaced the convict element that had formerly been of noticeable proportions. In 1846 there was no immigration to any part of New South Wales, for there was no land fund wherewith to defray the expense of it. The Legislative Council at Sydney sent three petitions, one to the Queen, one to the Lords, one to the Commons, praying them to take steps for the relief of the misery existing in England by casting on the parishes the duty and the cost of sending labourers out to Australia. It was astutely pointed out that there were thousands of strong active fellows in the old country who through want of employment were a burden on their parishes which had at that time practically to support them from one year's end to the other. Now, said the Sydney Council, would it not be better for these parishes to make one expense of it, and ship off these people for this new country, where they will be not only no burden on any body, but actually a source of great satisfaction to every body, including themselves. The line was well baited, but the parishes refused to bite and the scheme fell through. Another attempt had a similar ending. The Sydney Council proposed to borrow a million pounds on the territorial security of the colony, and to spend that money in bringing out twenty thousand immigrants. This measure was passed in September 1847, but the English Government refused to sanction the arrangement, and it was never carried out. A year or two later there were schemes for the emigration of \"orphans;\" and a system by which an employer of labour in Victoria could pay a sum of fifteen pounds in Melbourne, and for every sum so paid could have a labouring man selected for him by an agent in the British Isles, and sent out to him under a certain degree of governmental supervision ; but these arrangements brought out numbers that were comparatively small, and speaking generally it may be said that the era of assisted immigration to Port Phillip ended with the ill-fated Cataraqui."], [228, "POINT HICKS, OR CAPE EVERARD, GIPPSLAND.

HE accession of so large a population from Europe had greatly altered the character of the colony. In 1839 the people of Melbourne and Geelong, though geographically and politically belonging to New South Wales, formed in reality a dependence of Tasmania; everyone there looked to Launceston or Hobart as the ' centre of commercial activity; only those in the Murray District looked to Sydney as to headquarters. At the end of 1845, the arrival of more than twenty thousand immigrants direct from the old country had completely overwhelmed the Tasmanian and Sydney elements, and the district became a direct offshoot from England \u2014 as distinctly a new English colony as that at Adelaide. Though politically dependent on Sydney ; though Latrobe constantly referred all matters requiring a responsible judgment to his superior at Port Jackson, yet the temper of the community was wholly different from what it had been in its three or four earlier years. Among those who came without assistance, there were numbered several hundreds of young men who emigrated each with a few hundreds or a few thousands of pounds to live the free life of the squatter. Many of them were the cadets of landed families in the old world ; young fellows who a generation before would certainly have gone into the army, but now desired some occupation a little more stirring ; for thirty years of peace had rendered an officer's life the tamest of all employments ; whilst a squatting life in Australia tempted them with all the glamour of romance. These men, on their landing, to a certain extent took up their runs in the districts already settled ; but as a rule they forbore to crowd upon those who had ahead)-"], [229, "THE PIONEERS OF GIPPSLAND AND THE WIMMERA.\u20141840 TO 1846 207 come. For there was plenty of unoccupied land beyond, and a man could use as much as he chose by merely paying ten pounds each year for a license to depasture his flocks over an extent of land which it would take a man a day to ride across. Hence, from 1840 to 1846, the extremities of the colony, the eastern part called Gippsland, and the western called the Wimmera, began rapidly to be taken up by those who could only find room enough by pushing out beyond the bounds of occupation. For, according to the broad and lordly notions of the squatters, such a county as Bourke, with Melbourne for its centre, was now fully occupied ; it had about sixty stations, and so there were allowed to each somewhat less than thirty square miles, but as that made a circle of only six miles in diameter they felt themselves quite a tight fit in that county. Then in county Grant, with Geelong for its centre, there were almost exactly the same number of stations, and as that county is of nearly the same area, the squatters there also considered themselves to be as many as could well be squeezed in. These were the districts mainly occupied by Tasmanians. Then there was the Murray District, chiefly occupied by overlanders from Sydney; it contained 112 stations in 1845. The progress of settlement had first been to fill up the land along the Major's Line between the Ovens and the Goulburn. Judge Donnithorne, Messrs. Munro and Jennings, had joined the pioneers in 1838, Jardine and Fulton had come a little later, and M'Lachlan, D. Cameron, Simson and Darlot, Lachlan M'Kinnon, Chirnside and Lyon Campbell all followed, extending the settled area as far as the Loddon. Barber, Mitchell, Fowler, Brodribb, Mackay, Docker, Bonney, Speed, Bolden, Bell, Watson and Hunter were the next that took their herds into this well-watered district. In 1839, 1840, and 1 841 other squatters came across the Murray till the whole district from the Ovens to the Loddon was fairly well mapped out among the different holders of crown licenses. But this process was not carried out without some attempt at opposition from the blacks, the immemorial holders of these woods and grassy meadows. Sudden assassination on their part, retaliated by a general slaughter when the white men were roused to vengeance, filled this district with violence for half a dozen years. The most notable case was that of the Brothers Faithfull, who crossed the Murray with stock in 1838. Mr. William Faithfull was in the van. His party of fifteen men on the 10th April had camped about thirty miles beyond Wangaratta in a somewhat denser forest than usually prevailed on that track towards the Goulburn which they were following. They had seen a good deal of the blacks, and on that night found them wholly friendly, visiting the camp fires without hesitation or appearance of malice. One of the shepherds, named Bentley, expressed some suspicion, not only because of their numbers, but also because of there being no women among them, and because they seemed to be better armed than usual. But the overseer, Crossley, deemed that the ordinary precautions were sufficient for safety ; the usual watches were set throughout the night round the watchfires in the sombre forest, and the night gave place to dawn with no cause for alarm. After breakfast, however, the party became more scattered, as the various operations necessary for a start were being carried out in different directions. The shepherds were gathering their flocks, while the drivers were yoking their bullocks. The blacks who to the number of perhaps two hundred had been lurking about all night now stole up in their crafty mode of warfare concealed by grass or tree trunks, and suddenly displaying themselves hurled a shower of spears at the shepherds, who, being unarmed, turned and ran for the bullock drays, where there were three men with loaded guns; the blacks pursued only a short distance behind, and when the shepherds had reached the drays, there were only three armed men to face the crowd of yelling savages. Bentley sired a shot over Vol. I. 2 B"], [230, "208 VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. their heads to frighten them ; they in no way regarded it, but advanced from tree to tree, gliding with subtle rapidity. One of them was poising his spear when Bentley shot him dead, but a momemt after three spears took effect at once in his own body ; he fell and was overpowered by a rush of the natives, but with the butt end of his gun struggled on till the bludgeons of the blacks did their work on his uncovered head. The other men fired several shots, but without driving off their assailants, who, in a circle of diabolical excitement, surrounded the disconcerted party. Their spears took deadly effect, and one after another six men were stretched in death upon the grass. The remaining nine gathered for a rush to burst through the deadly circle ; it opened at that desperate charge ; but as the little party ploughed through their enemies there fell from right and left a shower of spears ; all were wounded ; two of them sank never to rise again, but the others fled back on their tracks to meet the party of Mr. George Faithfull who was coming up a day's march behind. There one of the wounded men died of the hurts he had received in that fatal rush. The natives plundered the property on the drays and drove away all the sheep, but these next day with the exception of 130 were recovered by the second party. It would probably be mere sentimentalism to regard any such conflict as an indication of patriotism on the part of the blacks, a noble effort to preserve their native land from intrusion. Probably they followed their belligerent and predatory instincts, the hope of plunder being added as a stimulus to their natural love of fighting. But theirs was the tragic fate in the end, for on the petition of the squatters of the district Gipps almost immediately sent an officer and twelve mounted police into the district, and nine more soon after arrived. Mounted on choice horses, with sabres jangling and carbines slung so as to be ready for instant use, they were a vastly different enemy from the party of fifteen shepherds with three old guns; and they proceeded to give the district a scouring. Official reports are very exact about the number of white men that died at the hands of the blacks, but no great trouble was taken, at least in this district, during the year of 1838 to determine how many of the natives were shot in retaliation. A bullet sent after a naked black form that was madly urging its way for the nearest shelter easily brought it down, and the marksman too often felt much more of pride at the excellence of his aim than of regret for the death of a human being. It was this district of the Murray between the Ovens and the Goulburn that was the first scene of a determined warfare between whites and blacks, but it is fair to notice that though the blacks were incomparably the heaviest sufferers yet they were also the aggressors. Just a month after the massacre of Faithfull's men a shepherd on an out-station of Bowman's, near the Coliban, was murdered under circumstances of much atrocity, and in the course of the next year or two seven others met with the same fate, being suddenly surprised when out with their sheep or attending to their duties in their lonely huts. The blacks drove away the sheep and ate as many as they could, then broke the legs of the remainder to prevent their escape, and sent out an invitation to all their neighbours to attend a great feast, when the sheep that had been helpless for a day or two were slaughtered ; and what with mutton for eating and grease wherewith to smear their bodies the dark men and women had a time of much festivity. But the performance was always concluded in the same way. The troopers are reported, the blacks decamp in a hurry, and breaking up into their several tribes withdraw to the densest scrubs, the marshiest regions, the stoniest ridges, whither the troopers on their valuable horses will be unable to follow them. But the latter haunt the district for weeks and months, and watch the place of retreat as a cat mounts guard over"], [231, "THE PIONEERS OF GIPPSLAND AND TLIE WLMMERA-1840 TO 1846. 209 a mouse-hole, and one by one the lurking blacks, if they endeavour to steal out of their hiding-places in search of food, are shot down at long range by the relentless troopers. The authorities made a register of forty-three blacks thus shot in revenge for the loss of eight shepherds, but these are to be taken more as samples than as an actual list of cases. The number might safely be doubled. The result of this desperate warfare was that for four or five years the Murray district was a very unsafe one. The squatters had their homesteads carefully loop-holed, and loaded guns were always kept at hand, and the occupants of the lonelier stations, having their nerves somewhat unstrung by the tension of constant watchfulness and anxiety, became suspicious, and apt to shoot a native whenever he came within sight. We cannot perhaps realise the feelings which impelled the natives to this state of warfare ; but we can easily imagine the exasperation of a settler like G. E. Mackay, who brought his cattle to the Ovens in March 1838, and took up land in a quiet and peaceable way, working hard, herding all day, watching nearly all night till he had broken his cattle to the run, and seen his homestead reared, and then he settled down for two years of unobtrusive industry. The natives came about his station ; he treated them kindly, gave them food, and they seemed to be on friendly terms with him. At length, in May 1840, a much larger crowd gathered than he could satisfy. He gave them such food and clothing as he could spare, but they clamoured for more, and for three days hung about the buildings in a sulky state, with threats as to what they would do unless satisfied. On the third afternoon they began to stick their spears into the horses, and brained a calf or two ; Mackay expostulated, but they paid no attention ; they proceeded to slaughter some cattle, wantonly killing far more than they could eat. He did not like to fire on them, for the shooting of an aboriginal was announced by Governor Gipps to be murder unless in actual self-defence. The blacks then retired, and it was thought that they had satisfied their revenge, but next morning a hutkeeper on the out-station was discovered stark and cold. A poor immigrant just arrived from Cork, he had found his way into the country and taken up his lonely post only to have his head battered in through mere wantonness by the blacks as they passed upon their way. But twenty-one of the tribe returned in a day or two, and in Mackay's absence burnt his huts, his stores, all his wheat, killed his horses, speared 180 cattle, and left him half ruined. No wonder that he spent the next eighteen months in pursuit of his injurers in company with the troopers who came to protect the district, carrying with him a warrant for the apprehension of Jacky Jacky, Billy O'Rourke, Jimmy the Blanket, Old Man Larry, Old Man Billy, Ogle-eyed Jimmy, Jim Crow, Brandy, and others of equally undignified appellations, the law having no other designation for them than the comic names invented by the hands upon the surrounding stations. Mr. George Faithfull relates an incident very suggestive of the perils of this state of warfare. Along with two shepherds he was travelling in the bush from one station to another, when suddenly they were surrounded by a large tribe of blacks brandishing their spears. The suddenness of the pipeclay-painted apparition made the horses bound and quiver with fear, but their riders were resolute. Mr. Faithfull's life was saved by his horse in its terror tumbling into a hole just as a spear grazed the pommel of his saddle. A rush of the natives then took place and a general scrimmage began. None of the three white men fell ; but what a day was that they spent ! From ten in the morning till three in the afternoon slowly retreating, firing deliberately and with circumspection, keeping the blacks well away, and dodging the half spent spears that fell around them. Mr. Faithfull declares that ten times the value of the"], [232, "VICTORIA AND LTS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 210 station he then held would not induce him to undergo such another clay. But, as he tells us, in consequence of such occurrences, the squatters and their men often banded themselves together for a grand hunt for aboriginals, and the black man was always in the end the sufferer. He came to recognise that fact. In 1845, when there were over a hundred stations in the district, and the white men, increased to 800, began to have not only the advantage of superior weapons and more abundant resources, but also the advantage of numbers, there was left to the blacks not even their former chance of a temporary success. From that time they either kept themselves out of the way or accepted service in the employment of the neighbouring squatters. But while the central part of the colony was thus becoming settled, and the fresh arrivals who came were no longer pioneers, but pars of an orderly community, the same rough work the same life of adventure was going forward in Gippsland. That inviting district had been discovered in 1840 as the result of a southward movement on the part 01 the squatters in the Maneroo district round the head of the Murrumbidgee. The year 1838 had been one of extreme drought, and the succeeding year still worse. In most parts of New South Wales the grass had almost wholly failed, and only those favoured squatters who had chanced to settle along the courses of the permanent streams could obtain water for their flocks. To save the lean and unhappy remnants of their stock many of them began a process of forming out-stations down among the mountains, where, if any tract of level land could be discovered, it was sure to be green and moist with the rains that the overhanging crests precipitated even in the summer heats. In 1839 the furthest south of these out-stations was that of Mr. James M'Farlane, at Omeo, in the heart of the Australian Alps. How much toil and labour it had cost to find a path into that green and sheltered valley we cannot now tell, as these earliest squatting discoverers were generally silent as to their progress. The man that followed the tortuous course of the Mitta Mitta or the upper reaches of the Murray, where these streams tumble and fret through tangled masses of gigantic timber, and weary thickets of blanket bush"], [233, "TILE PIONEERS OF GIPPSLAND AND THE WIMMERA~-i84o TO 1846. 211 and dogbush and sword-edged grasses and the rasping stems of interweaving creepers\u2014 the overseer who, in obedience to instructions, carried sheep and cattle and provisions through the heart of a dozen ranges with peaks of four and five thousand feet in height all round\u2014 such a pioneer was content to occupy his lucky discovery in silence, to fatten his famished stock on the succulent grasses, and to shelter them from the brazen sky beneath rustling groves, by the side of never-failing rivulets of ice-cool water; but he wanted no others to follow his track and crowd the favoured spot : and when there was so widespread a distress among the squatters, some such result must speedily have followed had such a discovery been made known. Hence we have no particulars of that eventful journey. All we know' is that M'Killop, M'Farlane, and Livingstone were the first to force their way into this magnificent but formidable region, Livingstone pitched his camp on the creek that now bears his name; it flows into Lake Omeo. and waters a pleasant district. M'Farlane held a station further south at Corrawang, near the modern township of Omeo. Thither in May 1839 came Angus M'Millan, an overseer in the service of Lachlan Macalister, who, fearing that when the coming winter should pass he might have another summer of distress in 1840 such as he had just endured, had sent the hard-featured but bold-hearted overseer to the south to find a situation for an out-station. Scotsmen all the world over find their hearts warm up within them to a brother Scot, and doubtless M'Farlane had favoured Macalister with a little information that was not generally known; but of course if M'Millan was to find an out-station for his employers without crowding upon those already at Omeo he must go further forth. This district, however, lies in the corner of a great angle of the Dividing Range, whose peaks \u2014 4000 or 5000 feet high all round \u2014 were already streaked with their feathery lines of snow, and no passes of any great hopefulness lay within view. However, on the 28th of May 1839 M'Millan sallied forth on his expedition.\" He was accompanied by Jemmy, an aboriginal from the station at Maneroo, who had taken service with Mr. Macalister. He had with him a compass, a sketch of Flinders' outline of the coast of Victoria, and provisions for three or four weeks. And so for five days he held south-west, heading for Corner Inlet, though he knew there was no prospect of getting so far\u2014 for only those who have tried it can guess the labour of a day's march in such glorious specimens of nature's prodigious fertility as these mountain gorges afford. Crawling from log to log up the deep ferntree gullies; forcing one's body with shoulder edgeways into the sneezy thicket; extricating one's boots from the tangle of creeping ferns; stumbling here; sitting down suddenly and involuntarily there; slipping on this glossy boulder and sliding down that mossy brink; laboriously climbing over a great fallen trunk to drop on the other side and find another of similar largeness \u2014 the day goes by and sees but little distance traversed. M'Millan and his black companion travelled without a tent in order to lighten the toil ; they made at night a rude shelter of bark ; and they took with them their provision in the most concentrated form 1 Bonwick's Port Phillip Settlement, p. 4SS. '-'M'Millan has told his story several times over in compliance with the requests of various friends. His first version was sent to his employer in 1840 ; another was furnished to Mr. Latrobe in 1S53, and a third to Mr. Bonwick in 1856. M'Combie prints a speech made by M'Millan at Port Albert in 1S56, in which he again tells his story. All these accounts are strictly consistent, except in trifling deviations of date; details from each of them are here given."], [234, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 212 possible. But the task was one of the severest imaginable, and Jemmy's heart failed him. All the fifth clay he begged on M'Millan to turn back for home ; but that determined Highlandman was making for a hill from which he trusted to discover the nature of the country beyond, and during the course of the day he reached its summit. The spacious view that stretched southward below him ranged over the finely grassed and well watered district which is now the county of Tanjil, and it terminated in the shimmer of Gippsland lakes and the hazy brightness of the sea beyond. But before these broad plains could be reached, there were lower ranges yet to cross with unknown tangles and thickets ; and next day when they again set forth to plunge into the still valley, where an awful sense of being shut out from human kind is apt to oppress the spirits of the traveller, Jemmy grew sulky, and urged the terrible savagery of the Warrigal or wild blacks who lived in the region they were approaching. Still M'Millan refused to turn back, and the sixth day having passed without bringing them out into the open country, they lit their fire, made ready their boiling tea, and, their supper over, betook themselves to rest for a long night's sleep after the weariness of the day. It was nearly being M'Millan's last slumber, for at dead of night he woke suddenly to find his companion standing over him with up-raised club, adjusting himself for such a blow as would leave no need for another. M'Millan brought his pistol up in range, and Jemmy fell back ; and begged for his life, saying he had been dreaming that a blackfellow had been running away with his wife, and so suddenly started up. During the remainder of the night, M'Millan kept carefully awake and watched the motions of the fellow, who was evidently anxious to get rid of his master and return to safety. In the morning, he thought it unwise to trust his life further to the fears of the wily native ; and on the other hand it was impossible to go forward alone by reason of the difficulty of carrying besides his arms, a sufficient supply of provisions for any length of time ; so the seventh day saw them retracing with all speed their track over the densely wooded ranges. Four days were sufficient to carry them back to Omeo. Before starting to return to Macalister's station, he learnt at Omeo of some other attempts to pierce the region. Macfarlane's nephew, a Mr. Mitchell, had crossed the ranges more directly south, and had struck the Tambo, which, however, had already been seen by some of the settlers and named the Bowman River. Mitchell had forced his way down the valley of that river to where Bruthen now stands, but returned with the report that there was no land there of any extent suitable for squatting purposes. Edward Bayliss had a little before succeeded in reaching the Snowy River, and had got as far as what is now called Buchan. But both these explorers reported that the country was of indescribable wildness, and there is in that no wonder ; for even at the present day the region is still only half known. There are considerable parts still wholly unexplored, and on the best modern maps the courses of the rivers are set down with dotted lines, as are those of Central Africa and the jungles of Northern Burmah and the wild selvas of Brazil. But the squatters were in desperation. A summer of drought was again setting in, and there was every prospect that in the autumn of 1 840, as in that of 1839, the road from Sydney to Yass would be stinking with the dotted carcases of sheep. Before M'Millan left Omeo, there were several squatters, Buckley and Pender, and Ryland, hunting for a place in which to save their flocks. M'Millan was immediately sent back by Macalister to form an out-station across the ranges from Omeo at the head-waters of the Tambo, where it was said small tracts of grassy country lay among the ranges. He drove a number of cattle across the Australian Alps \u2014 a formidable task \u2014 though the labour was greatly lightened by the fact that Mr. Edmund Buckley had already traversed the same route a few days before, in order to settle about thirty"], [235, "THE PLONEERS OF GIPPSLAND AND THE WIMMERA.\u20141840 TO 1846. 213 miles from Omeo ; but on the other hand, he was terribly impeded by a great snowstorm on the ranges, through which he did not force his way till the end of three days \u2014 his dray being dragged through the snow drifts with great labour, and the men suffering much from having no tents. But at length they began to descend the range again. They drove the cattle down the crashing woodlands and along the dripping gullies, and so out upon the clearer country which lies between Mount Tongio and Mount Baldhead. There, about ten miles beyond Buckley's station, he settled at Numbla-Munjee in September 1839 ; but the district was not really suitable for the purpose, and M'Millan still dreamt of the land he had seen from the mountain top some months before. In December he acted as guide to a party consisting of Matthew Macalister (the brother of his employer;, Mr. Cameron, and a stock-keeper named Bath. They were mounted, and had a pack-horse to carry provisions. For three days they forced their way into the ranges, cutting their track with excessive labour. On the fourth day the pack-horse slipped on the steep side of a hill ; it rolled to the bottom, and on its way down was badly wounded by the sharp points of the saplings it broke and rolled over. This accident rendered it the wisest course to return to the station and make a fresh start, which was done a week later, on the nth of January\u2014 the party being the same as before, except that it was joined by two of the Omeo blacks. By the compass they steered their course for Corner Inlet, and therefore had ten or twelve wild ranges to cross, not very high, but densely wooded, and with deep hollows of silent scrub between them. Four days' of labourers' toil from sunrise to sunset carried them thirty miles"], [236, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 214 over this country, and then they had the satisfaction of finding the timber open out and the land assume a tamer aspect. On the evening of the fourth day they encamped beside a pleasant river, with grassy flats on either bank. Next day they followed the stream till it brought them to a broad expanse of water, fresh, though a trifle brackish, and they were the first to enjoy the beauties of the Gippsland Lakes. To this one the explorers gave the name of Lake Victoria in honour of the youthful Queen, then on the eve of her marriage. Next day they passed over a fertile plain covered with a thick sward, and with no drawback but the excess of water, which made the margins of the lakes too boggy for travelling, and sent them a good way north out of their course to find places for crossing the streams. The first of the rivers they crossed was called the Nicholson, in honour of Dr. Nicholson, the Colonial Secretary at Sydney. This was a still and glassy current ninety feet wide and twelve feet deep, with boggy banks. To cross it they had to travel all the rest of that day to the north, towards its source in the ranges, and having forded it, they rested for the night. Next day they once more crossed a fine grassy plain, invading for the first time the lands now fast becoming populous round Bairnsdale. Two weather-beaten Scotchmen, a smart Scottish youth, and a stockman in bush attire mounted on scrubby horses, and followed by half-tame blacks leading a pack-horse, were surely objects that the astonished Gippslanders had never seen before. As the procession moved along, the white men became aware of lurking forms among the long grass and under the clustering shrubs ; but with no hostile intention ; the terror of the natives was complete ; as the cavalcade approached them, they turned and ran, leaving fires burning, and suppers cooking, and huts all standing without an attempt to save anything. One tribe that was taken wholly unawares stood and stared with unutterable surprise at the advancing forms \u2014 a man on horseback being doubtless a perfect terror in their eyes. M'Millan relates that he dismounted to salute them cordially, when, at sight of the terrible beast breaking itself into two parts they turned with a yell, and howling all the way secreted themselves in the densest scrub. Next day the party rounded the head of the lake, crossing through meadows of prospect quite delicious to a man who had seen cattle and sheep die by the thousand on the plains of the north, so fiercely scorched by a summer drought. At ten o'clock in the forenoon they reached a river flowing broader and deeper than the last. To it was given the name of Mitchell, in honour of the explorer of Western Victoria. They had to turn up this river also, and again involve themselves in the ranges, ere they reached a spot where it could be crossed. Next night they camped at what were called the Providence Ponds, but now form the bed of Tom's Creek. Again they spent a day traversing what M'Millan calls \"the most delightful country I ever saw, well adapted for cattle, sheep or cultivation,\" an estimate which subsequent experience has substantiated, for he was now entering the district of which Sale in our days is the centre. Next day they reached a fresh-water lake which M'Millan then took to be a part of Lake Victoria, but which was subsequently called Lake Wellington. They rounded its shores over grass)' flats, backed by forests of great extent that ran northward to the ranges. Hordes of blacks from time to time started out from the reedy water edge where they were busy fishing, others from the banks of another river \u2014 the third they had discovered. This they named the Avon, and they found it large enough to compel them once more to make a long detour to the north ere they could cross with their load of provisions. From their encampment that evening they had a charming view of the ranges, and a prominent peak that lifted its brow five thousand feet high from the plains they named Mount Wellington. The plains themselves were called after that John Macarthur who was the father of the wool-growing industry in"], [237, "THE PIONEERS OF GIPPSLAND AND THE WIMMERA.-1840 TO 1846. 215 Australia. On crossing them they came upon another broad river which Macmillan called after his employer, the \"Macalister.\" This was a stream 120 feet wide, flowing with deep but rapid current through a fine country, mostly open and grassy, but intersected by belts of forest. An unsuccessful effort was made next morning to cross it, and as M'Millan fancied that it must fall into the sea at or near Corner Inlet, which it was his chief desire to reach, he did not care to turn up the stream ; he therefore turned down, past the present sites of Newry and Maffra, till the Macalister joined another stream, which was named the Thomson, after Deas Thomson,' the Colonial Secretary at Sydney. A few miles further and they found that the Thomson fell 'into a still larger stream, which M'Millan called the Glengarry, but which is now known as the Latrobe. This stream turned due east, and to have followed it would have been to retrace their steps ; but they were now in that angle of the Thomson and the Latrobe near which stands the town of Sale, and to go forward they must cross one river or the other. They halted to make a determined effort for that purpose ; but they had neither boat nor cart that could be converted into a punt, the opposite banks were too high for horses to climb if they swam across, and the two natives failed to find any bark suited for making a canoe. Hence their day's delay produced no result. They saw some scores of blacks in and around the marshy lands that lay close by, no doubt attracted thither by the ducks and black swans that were so numerous in all directions. To some the white men gave chase, but all escaped till a ver)' old man was run down. They gave him a knife and an old pair of trousers, and tried to use him as a means of opening up communication with the rest of his tribe; but it was of no use. The old man seemed grateful, and after shaking hands with the white men, as the)- induced him to do, he shook the horses' bridles also, to show equal respect for the larger and stranger animals. They noticed that his personal ornaments consisted of three human hands, dried and suspended from his neck. We know now-a-days from fuller investigations of the GUM-TREE, ITS BARK CUT OUT FOR NATIVE CANOE. customs of the blacks that these must have been his mementoes of departed friends that had once been dear to him. Though he took his leave in safety, none of his friends would approach the white men. Next morning an anxious consultation was held. The only means of crossing was to turn up the stream till they found it fordable. But that implied a journey of several days, and their provisions were now reduced to ten pounds of flour, a small damper, and a little tea, an amount that would have sufficed only to carry them as far up the river as they had already been. M'Millan wished to try it, at a very much reduced daily ration, as he thought he must now be quite near to the Corner Inlet, a mistaken notion of his, for they were sixty miles away, with difficult country to traverse after they should have crossed the river. But he was outvoted. The others thought that as the)' had brought only fourteen days' provisions with them, and twelve were already gone, it was time to take the homeward track ; so the)- turned, and Vol. I. 2 C"], [238, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 216 after a journey of five days reached Numbla Munjee again, at the head of the Tambo, whence M'Millan sent a letter to Macalister, describing fully the nature and extent of his discoveries, but that gentleman was careful to let none of it become public. The zealous overseer at once took seven men and a dray loaded with provisions to cut a track from that station through the ranges and out into the splendid land around the lakes. He had been engaged in this task for three weeks when word came from Macalister that he was to form no more stations till he had reached Corner Inlet. This message was brought by Lieutenant Ross, of the Royal Navy, a friend of Macalister's, who was to accompany the expedition in its further progress. So again in July M'Millan formed one of an exploring party, consisting of the same persons with the addition of Lieutenant Ross, and another stockman, John M'Larren. In twelve days they reached the Latrobe River again, but higher up than where they had formerly struck it. Many attempts were made to swim their horses over it, but the prospect was now quite hopeless ; for the winter torrent was rushing in a deep black gulf that no horse could stem ; and again the explorers had to turn back. But M'Millan considered it his duty to disobey orders, and occupy the fine district he had already discovered, and so in October 1840, after another three weeks spent in continuing the cut track, he started over the ranges from Numbla Munjee with the first draft of 500 cattle. In a few days he had formed on the banks of the Avon River at the head of Lake Wellington the first station of Gippsland. There he built the first homestead of the district, and was joined by Matthew Macalister and some stockmen. No sooner was he settled than he was off again on his desperate search for Corner Inlet. This time he crossed the Latrobe higher up the stream than where his former attempts had been made, but immediately beyond the river he entered into a region of dense woodland, where, from the fertile soil of ranges, not high but widespreading, the saplings grew straight and tall and so close that a horse could not enter the forest ; there was no way round that they could see, and so it was a clear case for axe and tomahawk. They worked until all the implements of that sort which they had brought with them were broken or disabled, and then they turned back for the station at the Avon. Leaving Matthew Macalister in charge there, M'Millan returned to the north to persuade Lachlan Macalister to acquiesce in what had been done and to get a squatting license for the new run. On his return he found the station at the Avon deserted. The blacks had attacked it with unexampled ferocity, and Matthew Macalister and his men had with difficulty saved their lives by flight, leaving the cattle to escape as best they could, or fall a victim to the spears of the natives. M'Millan made up a party of eight persons, all well armed, and started for the scene of trouble. He had what he calls a \"desperate skirmish with the natives,\" but he gives no particulars. Probably there was some blood spilt, though none of it was European, but at any rate he made good his footing again and reformed his station, the little party being far from civilisation \u2014 the lonely occupants of all that wide district which M'Millan in patriotic mood called Caledonia Australis ; a name which never became common. The name of Gippsland was due to a distinguished traveller who followed hard upon the heels of the dauntless and restless Scotchman. This was the Polish Count Strzelecki, who, after similar work in other parts of the world, was at this time in New South Wales engaged in geologic and geographic researches. Now it so happened that in the winter of 1839 Mr. James Macarthur, one of the family of that John Macarthur to whom the sheep-breeding industry of .Australia owes its origin, was on board H. M.S. Pelorus on its voyage from Tasmania to Sydney."], [239, "THE PIONEERS OF GIPPSLAND AND THE WIMMERA.- -1840 TO 1846 217 A heavy gale from the north-east prevented the vessel from weathering Cape Howe for several days, and during that period she stood off and on along the coasts of Gippsland, so that she gave the passengers upon her decks occasional glimpses, not of the Gippsland scenery, for they were not near enough, but of broad plains skirted by encircling mountains as a dreamy background. James Macarthur was convinced that therein must lie a district free from the droughts that were then the squatters' dread. On arriving in Sydney he resolved to organise an expedition for the exploration of that country, and mentioned his proposal to Count Strzelecki, who was even then collecting the materials for his well-known book, the \"Physical Description of New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land.\" The Count was delighted with a chance of examining what science could reveal amid those mountainous regions that formed the most romantic portion of Australia. And so the trip was put in preparation, the cost falling chiefly upon Mr. Macarthur, who expended in it not less than five hundred pounds.3 Macarthur was accompanied by his friend James Riley, and a servant ; Strzelecki also took a servant, and the party was completed to the half-dozen by the addition of Charlie Tarra, a blackfellow in the service of Macarthur. From Macarthur's station near Tumut they made a start with pack-horses and abundant provisions, and without difficult)' reached Omeo and pushed on to Numbla Munjee, where M'Millan had recently formed his station for Macalister at the head of the Tambo. He had just returned from that trip in which he had discovered Lakes Victoria and Wellington and penetrated to the River Latrobe. But he was again absent, having gone to the north to report progress at Maneroo. However, Macarthur and Strzelecki's party were hospitably received by Matthew Macalister, and after several days of rest were guided a few miles on the way to Lake Victoria. This part of the journey was comparatively easy ; the track had been blazed on the trees through the gloomy sorest by M'Millan, and the younger Macalister ere he left them gave them ample instructions as to the rivers to be crossed and the best fording places, and in general the main features of the country they had to traverse. But Strzelecki was a little uncivil to his predecessor. Forgetting that he was only the second to traverse this district, he reversed all the names given by his predecessor, and in particular ignored the name of South Caledonia given by M'Millan. In an official report which he sent to Sydney, he \"takes the liberty of naming it in honour of His Excellency the Governor, Gippsland.\" This party followed, as M'Millan had done, the course of the Tambo, which Strzelecki re-christened the Thomson, after Deas Thomson, the Colonial Secretary at Sydney, though M'Millan had already given that name to a tributary of the Latrobe. This river led them to the lake which M'Millan had called Victoria, but which Strzelecki now re-named Lake King, in compliment to Captain Philip Parker King. This name has been retained, and the name Victoria given to the long sheet of water which forms the connection between Lakes Wellington and King. Following the banks of Lake King, the party crossed the river called by M'Millan the Nicholson, and came to the banks of the larger river, which he named the Mitchell. Strzelecki called the former of these the Riley and the latter the Macarthur, after his companions, but M'Millan's names have rightly been preserved. Their course then lay south-west through pasture lands of grasses waving rich as corn, but pleasantly diversified by open timber, which gave them the aspect of a park of the greatest spaciousness. And so they struck the shores of Lake Wellington, which they followed, still with no difficulty, through 3 Macarthur published his account of the trip in the Argus during 1S56. Bonwick has printed this letter in full\u2014 \"Port Phillip Settlement,\" p. 406."], [240, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT 218 open parks. The first river they crossed was named the Perry, in compliment to Captain 1 erry, who was then temporarily at the head of the Sydney Survey Department. To the next was given the name of the Barney River, but M'Millan had already called it the Avon, and his name has been preserved. They were now at the head of Lake Wellington, and they turned their course again south-west, in a line that would bring them straight upon Corner Inlet. But at fourteen miles they reached a fine stream, the largest they had yet met. This was what M'Millan had called the Glengarry ; Strzelecki changed its name to the Latrobe, which appellation has been retained. They had already had a preliminary taste of what was awaiting them further on, in a desperate plunge for two days through a willow scrub which had turned them out of their course. On crossing the Latrobe they found the ON THE TAMBO RIVER, ABOVE BRUTHEN, aspect of the country quite altered ; the lightly-timbered plains gave place to a wildly exuberant forest of bluegum and blackbutt, magnificent to view, but terrible to traverse. It was only after crossing the Latrobe that Strzelecki was on fresh ground. Up to that point he had been preceded by M'Millan. But now it seemed as if the formidable nature of that splendid forest would make it impossible to add anything new to discovery. But with resolute courage they forced themselves into that region where M'Millan had toiled till he broke all his axes and then had turned back so grievously baffled. Strzelecki put his men on short allowance; each of the party was allowed a biscuit and a slice of bacon per day. The Polish count was a lean spare man of middle-size, and to judge by his aspect little likely to survive this rough work of that widespread forest. But his light frame was wiry and was stirred to restless energy by a"], [241, "THE PIONEERS OF GIPPSLAND AND THE WIMMERA.\u20141840 TO 1S46 219 nervous and excitable soul ; with all the ardour of an uncompromising enthusiast he flung himself into the task. But though they toiled and toiled they made but little progress. The bluegum saplings were often too close to permit of horses passing without the laborious cutting of a track, and the track when cut too often led up to a prostrate trunk, a mighty giant, impassable by horses. Then it became necessary to cut a road round the procumbent mass a hundred feet perhaps, through blanket bush and wildly overtopping grasses, and when the end was nearly reached another log of equal size was found perhaps lying crosswise, and so enclosing them within an angle. Then began the frightful labour of chopping a huge nick in some vast log through which the horses might step, and when the evening was come, a mile or two of progress was all that could be shown as the result of a day of ardent toil from dawn till sunset. The horses had no proper feed, and grew scraggy and worn ; they could go no further ; but the party had no provisions with which to return. It was as if they were caught in a trap. The six horses were therefore abandoned on the twelfth day, and it was resolved to make a dash for Western Port in the hope that the party might possibly save their lives. So there in the depth of the mighty forest they left their luggage and the Count abandoned all his laboriously collected specimens, and with such slight provisions as were left them, they turned from their south-west course that led to Corner Inlet, which they had designed to reach, but at which there was no dweller, wherein there lay no succour. They turned due west for Western Port, which was twice as far away, but there were settlers there, and their nearest safety la)- upon its shores. They had now no horses for which to cut a track. Where they could squeeze their own bodies through was track enough, and over these fallen logs they could quickly scramble when by themselves, but still there were terrible patches of scrub, a tangled undergrowth reaching a man's waist, through which they had to wade with steps of excessive toil ; and there were patches of saplings so close that only shoulder work could carry the body through, and then at the expense of clothing and skin. As the Count remarks,' \" Such were the difficulties encountered that with the utmost exertion, stimulated by the sense of peril, a progress of from two to three miles per day was all that could be accomplished.\" There was no exploration in all this. They were saving their lives. Their provisions were all spent, but by the exertions of Charlie Tarra, the blackfellow, many a Koala or native bear was dragged forth from its hiding-place to form a meal for the famished crew. For fifteen days this continued, but at length when they were well over that ridge now called the Strzelecki Range, the country became less heavily timbered, and they descended to the grassy lands and swampy plains that lie round Western Port. There, around the spot where the former attempt at settlement had been made, and where the cottages still stood, a twelve years' wreck, there were a few settlers with cattle, the vanguard of the onward pushing crowd. The wayworn party were received with kindly welcome, and after remaining some days to recruit their strength, they resumed their course to Melbourne. But that course was now merely from station to station, for all this land had been taken up. The first who had crossed the Dandenong Creek from Melbourne had been John Highett, who seems in 1836 to have taken his stock to the neighbourhood of the site of the present Frankston ; Terence O'Connor had followed, and three brothers named Ruffy were next in settling on the land between Frankston and Berwick. In 1838 John Hawdon had been the first to actually settle on the Dandenong, but he soon departed, selling his cattle to Captain Lonsdale, who left them under the charge of an overseer, Alfred Langhorne. The ' \" Physical Description of New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land,\" p. 64."], [242, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 220 hut erected for himself by the latter was the nucleus of the present township of Dandenong. In the same year the Rev. James Clow had taken up a station a little further on \u2014 a clergyman from India who was leaving clerical pursuits for squatting. And in that year also came an overseer of Charles Campbell, of Sydney, with 800 cattle ; he appropriated all the land from Cape Schanck to Point Nepean, and as far as Arthur's Seat. But in 1838 he sold out to Robert Jamieson, who made his homestead near Cape Schanck, while Edward Hobson formed a station at Kangerong, between Arthur's Seat and Schnapper Point, on what was then called the Point Nepean Road. These were all squatters; but in 1839 Anderson and Massie had formed a farm on the shores of W'estern Port, close to the Bass River, and close to the place where the settlement of 1827 had been formed and abandoned. There they grew produce for the Melbourne market, to which they despatched it by small vessels of twenty or thirty tons. It was to this farm that the weary band of famished explorers approached from their toilsome and dangerous experiences of the forest, a very thin and haggard party, but all there, none dead. They were well received, and a day or two of rest prepared them to go onward. On their march to Melbourne, they passed Armstrong's place at two miles distance, and five miles further reached Cuthbert and Gardiner's. Another twelve miles brought them to Mundy's station, and seven miles more to a place which Robert Jamieson had just formed at Yalloak, near the head of Western Port. Then came James Jamieson's station, and Manton's farm and cattle station. Charles Dodd, Turnbull, and Reoch came next, then Captain Howie, and Captain Minton ; then came Bath and Perry, and O'Connor and the brothers Ruffy (already mentioned), and Woolley; and so through settled land the travellers reached Dandenong, where Langhorne was, and Dr. M'Crae had a cattle run. Next came the home stead of the Rev. Mr. Clow, and Captain Baxter's land behind Frankston. Seven miles beyond Dandenong they reached the region of inns, the first being the \" No Good, Damper,\" a little roadside shanty ; and so through settled country to Melbourne. The arrival of Strzelecki's party caused much excitement, as they had been given up for lost, and there had been talk of organising a search expedition. But now that they were come with glowing accounts of that fine district of Gippsland, the enterprise of the speculative was at once stirred, and plans were soon on foot by which the capitalists of Melbourne proposed to share in the opportunities of the district instead of leaving them all to the squatters from the Maneroo. An accident had recently facilitated this design. Towards the end of 1S40 the Clonmel steamer sailed from Sydney for Melbourne well laden with goods, and carrying ninety passengers ; three days afterwards she went ashore on the coast of Gippsland ; she beached herself on one of the sandy spits that line the coast to the east of Corner Inlet. It was a spring-tide, and the receding waters left her little harmed, but without any possible chance of floating off. One of the ship's boats was taken by a volunteer crew, who proposed to sail in her round to Port Phillip, but they had not gone far on their dangerous trip ere they were picked up by a Tasmanian vessel. Several small craft of light draught were sent round to rescue the passengers, and save as much as possible of the cargo of the Clonmel. All this attracted public attention to the Gippsland district, and in Melbourne the general feeling was that there was money to be made by cattle-breeding in a region of rivers and succulent grasses, perhaps not dry enough for sheep, but clearly adapted for the fattening of bullocks. At the end of January 1841 a meeting of \"overlanders\" in Melbourne was held to discuss the matter. It was resolved to charter a vessel, to carry round a prospecting party, seeing that the route by land was so impracticable. Eight gentlemen subscribed for the purpose, namely"], [243, "THE PIONEERS OF GIPPSLAND AND THE WIMMERA.\u20141840 TO 1846. 221 Dr. Stewart, Mr. Rankine, Mr. Orr, Mr. Kinghorne, Mr. M'Leod, Mr. Kirsopp, Mr. W. A. Brodribb, and Mr. Macfarlane, 5 and the Singapore was chartered for three weeks for the sum of three hundred pounds, with permission to retain her beyond that time at the rate of twelve pounds per day. She took on board nine horses, with flour, tea, sugar, salt pork, implements, ammunition, and all things necessary for the formation of a depot, and in addition to the eight gentlemen themselves, there went an overseer and four men, while Strzelecki allowed Charlie Tarra to go with them as guide. So they sailed on the 4th of February, 1841. A dull voyage of nine days brought them to Corner Inlet, but that is a shallow expanse of intricate navigation, and they had the excitement of running on a sandbank, over which the rising tide lifted them into a narrow channel beyond, from which it was difficult to see a way out. While the vessel lay a day in this situation the party landed on an adjacent piece of land, which they called Rabbit Island from the fact that it was absolutely swarming with rabbits, the progeny of a pair which a philanthropic sea captain had formerly left there, rehearsing on a small scale what the colony at large has since then experienced to its cost. When the Singapore got properly into Corner Inlet the boats were taken by the pioneer party to look for a landing-place. Every morning for a fortnight were these two boats taken out in different directions in search of a place where horses could land, and every evening did the party return dispirited. It seemed as if Gippsland were to be as inaccessible by sea as by land, for Corner Inlet was then the only opening known to exist. All to the east was the sweep of the Ninety Mile Beach, in which there had as yet been no discovery of the narrow Lakes' Entrance. The time was already past the three weeks of the original charter, and the majority thought it wisest to abandon the enterprise and return to Melbourne. But the experience of the parties that had recently come from the Clonmel suggested that a final effort should be made in that direction, and the captain of the Singapore fitted out his long-boat and took charge of her for a longer trip to the east of Corner Inlet. But ere they reached the wreck the)- saw a long arm open between some sandy islands, and when the)' had followed it until the water became too shoal for the long-boat, it was their good fortune to find here two of the small boats of the Clonmel lying high and dry, but upside down upon the sandbank. \u00b0 Pleased with this discovery, they left two men well armed to take charge of the long boat, and, themselves in the lighter boats, they pulled twelve miles up the inlet, which to their delight they found open into two little rivers of cool, clear, fresh water. One of these they called the Albert, in honour of the Prince Consort, and the other the Tarra, in honour of their sable friend, the cheerful and obliging Charlie. Here it was easy to land ; the soil was rather heavily timbered, but the grass was nevertheless excellent, and kangaroos were seen in surprising abundance. They wished the captain to bring the Singapore round into this place, but he refused, alleging that as his vessel was insured only for a voyage to Corner Inlet, if he went further and lost her the insurance money would not be recoverable. They saw the reasonableness of the objection, and leaving the Singapore at her moorings, spent three days in the long boat, exploring for the best channel by which to lead future vessels up to the place they had chosen for their depot, to which they had already given the name of Port Albert. To form this depot they proceeded to land their nine horses and all necessary provisions by means of their three boats. The distance to be travelled at each \u25a0'\u2022 M'Combie, p. 7S. \" The story of this expedition is derived from the \" Recollections of an Australian Squatter,\"' by the Hon. \\\\ 7 A.

At the depot there remained five of the gentlemen, with the overseer, sour men, and Charlie Tarra, who set to work at once and built a good two-roomed cottage close to the beach at the mouth of the Albert River; at its door they mounted a small brass cannon, which they had brought with them, for the blacks were numerous and of an obtrusive friendliness that might be but the covering of intended mischief. The white men refused to let them come within a hundred yards of the house, but just a little outside of that distance a band of thirty formed a permanent camp ; their watchfire blazed all night in uneasy proximity, and they were restless in the midnight hours, so that the white men felt it necessary to have a good fire blazing also and a careful watch set day and night. But there was no collision, except on one occasion when the blacks tried to steal some blankets, and on being detected and driven off discharged a shower of spears into the canvas tent in which the gentlemen lodged. A few musket shots fired over their heads seemed to be a good enough cure. After a time the five gentlemen, tired of inaction, resolved to penetrate further into Gippsland and then find a way overland to Melbourne. The)- left the overseer with three men at the depot, all well armed and each with plenty of ball cartridge, while the cannon was mounted anew with special care. The five gentlemen, with a servant and Charlie, started one fine autumn morning on horseback, followed by three packhorses well laden with provisions. All were young and healthy, and in good spirits. The country was beautiful, the travelling easy, and the trip was of the pleasantest aspect. LTp at four in the morning, amid the call of the bell-bird and the whirr of the lyre-bird, down in some ferny hollow, they had a gay breakfast, and started on a pleasant ride through the long grass, amid which the kangaroos in scores were feeding, till, hearing the sound of approaching strangers, they stood in motionless astonishment on their tails and hind legs, then turning, hopped in gigantic bounds into their dew-cooled coverts. So they reached the Latrobe, which their horses found some difficulty in crossing, so steep were the banks ; then on through country that had all the look of interminable cornfields, with the young wheat still green in the blade, till they came upon Lake Wellington, and scared the black swans in clouds that darkened the sky above their heads. They had now to turn back, as provisions were running short; in four days more they had re-crossed the Latrobe fifty miles further up, and had set their faces to the difficult task of finding a way out of Gippsland to Melbourne. In a day more they knew what a task they had undertaken. Though they had kept well to the north of Strzelecki's course, they were now in the same region of densely wooded ranges. The trees were giants, and filled between with thick scrub all intertwined with creeping vines, and round the prostrate giants they had to cut their dreary way. Each took his turn at the hatchet work, and a second followed with compass ever in hand, so that in spite of constant deviations, the track should be held as nearly south-w^est as possible. Then came the party in single file with the patient horses behind them. It was a sorry place for these poor animals, as not a blade of grass was to be seen, and the gum-leaves were of little use for pasturage. But the party was at least more fortunate than the Count had been, for what had taken him twenty-two days to aeccomplish, the-)' by keeping a little further to the north had completed in nine ; but then, they had not found it necessary to abandon their horses, which they must have done"], [245, "THE PIONEERS OF GIPPSLAND AND THE WIMMERA.-1840 TO 1S46. 223 had they taken another day to reach the open * land round Western Port. It was poor and covered with heath, but a quantity of coarse grass they came upon saved the lives of their horses. In another day they began to see traces of cattle, and soon reached Dr. Jamieson's station. The Doctor was not at home ; the servants looked on the tattered crew as probable bushrangers, and it was not for some little time that they secured a favourable reception Then a proper meal, properly cooked, and beds with sheets on them to sleep in, made the station quite a corner of paradise to the worn-out explorers. A day or two later they were in Melbourne, delighted with Gippsland, but obliged to confess that they had found no route thither that was passable by stock. But it was in one sense a consolation to find that this failure was due to no fault of their own, for during their absence a strong Government party, headed by a Crown Lands Commissioner, had started from Melbourne to find a road to the new country and had already returned to the town as much discomfited as they were. Likewise a private party consisting of Edward Bell, Alexander Hunter, and Archibald Jamieson had gone out on the same quest, but had not reached the Latrobe River till after eighteen days of formidable toil over country quite unsuited for stock. If then there was to be any settlement of Gippsland from the Melbourne side it must, in the first instance at least, be by sea; and the association chartered a smaller and handier vessel, a schooner of sixty tons, to carry further necessaries to their depot. They waited as a deputation on Mr. Latrobe and requested that a township should be laid out and land surveyed for sale at Port Albert. When he agreed they offered, in order to hurry on operations, to give the Government surveyor and his party a free passage in their schooner and to carry round a dray and team of bullocks for the use of the survey party. Latrobe closed with the offer, and Surveyor Townsend sailed soon after, Mr. Brodribb and Mr. John Hunter proceeding with the schooner to attend to the affairs of the settlement. On arriving at Port Albert they found the party well that had been left in charge. The blacks had on one occasion made an attack, but a single discharge of the brass cannon before the door had sent them flying back into the bush. Whilst the surveys were going forward there arrived a vessel with a party of settlers and some stock from Sydney. Each party was a little jealous of the other, but worse than that, this vessel brought to Surveyor Townsend a letter from Sir Thomas Mitchell directing him to take no instructions from Mr. Latrobe, who had nothing whatever to do with the survey operations of the colony. Harassed by conflicting orders, the surveyor proceeded but slowly with his work, and meantime there came more settlers. The Seahorse, a well-known steamer at that time trading between Melbourne and Sydney, had called and landed Mr. Reeves and others, who increased the total number of persons encamped at Port Albert to nearly a hundred. Meantime the squatters from the Sydney side had shown abundant enterprise in pushing over the ranges. A regular track had been made from Omeo to the Lakes at a cost of about \u00a32000, defrayed mainly by Lachlan Macalister, who now had two fine stations at the head of the river that bears his name. M'Millan had by this time a station of his own at the head of the river Avon ; in June 1842 quite a crowd of shepherds and stockmen were gathering great numbers of animals at Omeo for a bold push together over the ranges to Gippsland ere the winter snows should descend. Raymond and Loughnan and Taylor were the three proprietors, and just as they were starting F. Jones added his flocks to the long procession, which defiled in a thin and winding line along the plashy paths in the gloomy forest.

Mason and Campbell and Bloomfield ; Curlewis and Hobson and Turnbull; Collins and Buckley and Scott, with many others, gathered, till in 1844 there were forty stations with 327 persons in Gippsland, and the stock introduced was reported by the Commissioner to consist of 20,000 cattle and 62,000 sheep.7 After a delay of a year the survey charts had gone to Sydney, and arrangements had there slowly matured for a sale of land in the new township of Alberton. The allotments were sold, but the place did not thrive ; the first enthusiasm had had time to cool, and in a year's delay, the intending storekeepers, and innkeepers, and mechanics had grown tired of waiting and gone off to places more readily available. In their stead had come a swarm of escaped convicts,8 noisy men and undesirable women. For a time Alberton had a reputation of no enviable kind, till the police recaptured the prisoners and drove out the free people of bad character ; but by that time the respectable folks had taken themselves off, and had begun to form a township on their own account on some land which Reeves had bought along the frontage of the River Tarra, whence the new place took its name of Tarraville. In 1845 Gippsland was a settled district with thirty thousand cattle and a hundred thousand sheep, distributed over about a hundred stations, and thus in the course of four years an important addition was made to the resources of mankind, and a fair and fertile region contributed to the inhabited portion of the earth. With equal pace the flow of settlement had spread out into the westernmost parts also of Victoria. Young men from England, cadets of ancient families, often of culture and education, continued to arrive with their small capitals with which they proposed to embark in the venturesome life on the plains. There was no room for them round Geelong. The land was all occupied up to Lake Colac and Mount Buninyong, and new-- comers must find fresh pastures. In 1839 the Watson brothers led the way across the Hopkins and formed a station at Merang ; in the same year came Thomas Chirnside to the Fiery Creek, and Donald and Hamilton and Hassel, and the two Macredies, M'Nab, Wright, and Montgomery ; Kirk and Wyselaskie, and Steele and Airy, the brother of the distinguished astronomer. In 1839 there came mostly by the same vessel a number of young men who settled on the lower course of the Hopkins. These were Neil Black and his partners of the Glenormiston estate ; Finlay and Gladstone, brother of the famous statesman ; there was Captain Eddington, of the First Royals, from whom a thriving township on the Loddon now derives its name, where subsequently he held a station \u2014 but his first venture was here to the south. At the mouth of the river, in a remarkably pretty spot, opposite the place where Warrnambool was destined to grow, three brothers named Allan formed the station of Tooram. Not far away, but nearer the site of Belfast, two brothers named Aplin were settled, and James Dawson \u2014 since then known for his researches on the aborigines \u2014 formed his abode at Kangatong and near him James Irvine, and Charles MacKnight, and Dalmahoy Campbell, and Robert Crawford, brother of Lord Ardmillan. On the Hopkins there settled two old sailors, Captain Webster and Captain Adams, both retired from the East India Company's service \u2014 weary of the sea, but keen for a life in the open air and with adventure to sweeten it.!' And certainly there was every element of a free and sturdy life that the most buoyant spirit could wish.

Then there was the choice of land ; the riding hither and thither in fine expanses of charming country, the occupation of some romantic spot as a homestead. There was the choice of a tree or two that would split straight for slabs ; the bringing of it to earth ; the cross-cut saw and the adze ; the rearing of ridge-poles and the setting up of walls and chimneys ; the boarded floor, the wall-plated ceiling, occupied some busy weeks ; the thatching or covering with bark, the dressing of doors and tables, and washstands and bedsteads, and chairs, out of slabs and \"round-stuff,\" put squatter's homestead in old and in new times.io the young heart in proud realisation of the Robinson Crusoe and Fennimorc Cooper dreams oi his boyhood. But these settlers, as has already been said, were mostly men of education, and in the natural course of things they steadily made their surroundings wear an air of greater civilisation. One noticeable feature was their gathering of books ; the libraries there to be met with in slab cottages often astonished the traveller who accepted the squatter's hospitality for a night, and great was the traffic to and fro for the borrowing and lending of books. There was '\u00bb Mr Chas Gray of Nareeb-Nareeb, Chatsworth, split the slabs for and built the above hut in 1840-41, and in building 'the chimney was assisted by Mr. George Bourciquot, who was afterwards proprieto*: of the Melbourne Daily News.

And after a few years, when the young squatter went home to see his people, some little scheme of his that had slept a quiet sleep in the rough life of the plains was revealed to the outer world when he brought with him the sweetheart who had been the lodestar of these pioneer days. Then rose the weatherboard cottage with glass windows and the neatness of paint ; then the picket fence in shining white surrounded the tasteful garden, and carpets appeared, and a piano could be heard, and a daintier table bore tribute to the blessings of womanly care and refinement. Instead of dragging for themselves all they wanted in bullock drays from Geelong, they found the storekeeper useful whom the progress of settlement attracted to the more populous districts. Then came the post-office and the regular supply of newspapers; and, in a word, the age of civilisation was fast spreading into the plains beyond Lake Colac and the River Hopkins. Portland was the distinct centre of a process of settlement still further to the west, along the courses of the Glenelg and its tributaries. For five years the quiet pastoral prosperity of the Henty family had been broken by no intruders. Edward Henty, at Muntham, and Frank Henty, on the Merino Downs, had practically held the district. In 1838 came Samuel Winter from Tasmania to settle at Tahara, on the Wannon, not far from Muntham, and after a time his brother George and his cousin Trevor joined him. In 1839 John Bryant came to form a station on the creek that bears his name, and he was followed in that or the next year by the brothers White at their station of \" Koonongwootong,\" and Addison and Murray at Dunrobin ; a little later by Savage and Dana, by the Corney brothers at Cashmere, by Thomas Tulloh at the \" Retreat,\" by Purbrick, by Wrentmore and Butcher, by the brothers Coldham, by Lang and Elmes and French. These all settled in the charming valleys of the Glenelg and Wannon, one after another taking up the land further and further towards the sources of these streams. They were met by a current of settlers who were beginning to cross the Hopkins, men who were driving their flocks from Geelong out into the favoured west. The first were the three Wedges, nephews of John Hilder Wedge, who formed a station which they called the Grange on that tributary of the Wannon called the Grange Burn, where, in the course of two or three years, an innkeeper of the name of Russell built his \" Grange Inn,\" which being central and well conducted became a noted place in the Western District. Mr. French, the police magistrate for the district, took up his residence there, and by degrees there grew round it that township then called the Grange, but now a busy centre with the name of Hamilton. After the Wedges came John Cox in 1840, and Dr. Martin, and Barton, and Aylward, and Norris, till all the country along the rivers Shaw and Wannon was fully occupied. This course of settlement naturally caused the growth of seaports in the most suitable situations. The first to be proclaimed as a township was Portland, to which Foster Fyans had been directed to proceed in May of 1839, in order to report on its suitability for that purpose. His report was favourable. He considered the situation one of the very best in the colonies. He found in the district about three hundred persons, and already there were two or three shanties occupied as stores at Portland Bay for their convenience. Accordingly, Assistant-Surveyor Smythe was sent round to prepare allotments for sale, and on the 15th October 1840, the first auction of Portland land took place in Melbourne; 40 half-acre allotments in the town were sold for an average of \u00a3250 each; 50 acres of suburban"], [249, "THE PIONEERS OF GIPPSLAND AND THE WIMMERA.\u2014 1840 TO 1846. 227 land produced \u00a364 each, and 267 acres of land for cultivation within two miles of the town brought \u00a311 each, the total being over .\u00a317,003. Captain Foster Fyans was directed to take up his residence there as Crown Lands Commissioner, and Mr. James Blair was sent round as police magistrate. Thus the little town was launched into existence, and began to assume the appearance of a neat little village. When Mr. Blair reached it there was a population of about one hundred persons in the township, and six good cottages had been raised in addition to Stephen Henty's mansion, but the bulk of the people were still occupying temporary huts. Five years later it had a population of 510 persons, and showed two or three regular streets which Dr. Lang, who visited it in 1845, declared to be of an appearance surprisingly creditable, no less a sum than \u00a330,000 having in that time been spent on private buildings, while the Government had raised a fine court-house of light grey granite and a good gaol. At that time a wooden jetty of three hundred feet was being formed for the convenience of the numerous wool ships that began to call at the port. The town had several good inns and two newspapers, so that it made quite a little metropolis for this district of Normanby, as it was then called, which was beginning to be fully settled. Indeed, almost all the country was now in a measure occupied that was not hopelessly dense with forest. There was, however, one great exception. All that north-western corner of the colony, known vaguely as the Wimmera, was in 1842 regarded by the squatters as a mere wilderness. Out on those dry plains which stretched westward of the Campaspe the \"overlanders\" reported that there was nothing but worthless saltbush \u2014 a dreary, wretched desert, scorched in summer, and barely wet by the winter rains. But in 1844 the squatters were pressing all round this area, and up to its edge the land was overcrowded, after the notions of the pastoral mind. Quite a crowd of settlers had pushed out along the course of the Loddon from 1839 to 1842. In the former year M'Lachlan had taken up Mount Cole, and H. Norman Simson sent his manager, J. M. Darlot, with 13,000 sheep, 4000 cattle, and a great crowd of mounted shepherds and stockmen overland from Sydney to occupy the land at the head of the Loddon ; he formed four stations from the site of Clunes to that of Castlemaine. Near the latter place M'Knight and Campbell formed a station about the same time, and subsequent comers had to go forward towards the Murray into drier country. Lachlan Mackinnon, Colin Mackinnon, Donald Mackinnon, M'Callum, Hodgkinson, Catto, Heap, Grice, and Charles Sherratt kept to the course of the Loddon, and covered with sheep the country as far as the present site of Inglewood. This was the limit of settlement in 1840, and there it remained for three years, while others came to crowd the district \u2014 Wallace, and Hope, and Bates, and Ballantyne. Then the pressure from behind sent out the stock upon the thirsty plains. In July 1843 Darlot, now on his own account, went down the Wimmera with 30x3 cattle ; he dwelt some months in the lonely solitude ; then Taylor and M'Pherson, Splatt and Pynsent, the Wilson brothers, and Major Firebrace went still further forward, and in 1844 the wave of settlement was lapping the foot of Mount Arapiles. Still further out on the parched and dusty plain went Carfrae, and Brodie, and Cruikshanks, till in 1846 Hugh M'Leod touched the furthest point when he took up his station of Benyeo on the boundary line of South Australia. Thus the prophecy of Major Mitchell was accomplished, when ten years before he looked from Mount Arapiles and foresaw these plains the home of industrious settlement. Meanwhile, along the Loddon and the Avoca the squatters were moving north over the wide plains that lead to the Murray. In 1840 Bear, and Booth, and Argyle, and Brain, and Williams, and Thorpe went out as far as there was permanent water in the Loddon, and"], [250, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 228 there the progress of settlement ceased for four years till M'Callum, and Collyer, and Green went further, and settled on that dry and uninviting country beyond the junction of the Campaspe and the Murray. In 1845 M'Callum, Curlewis, and Cowper went out to the end of the Avoca River and Lake Tyrrell, and finally in 1847 Andrew Beveridge touched the furthest point by reaching the Murray across the dense scrub of the plains ; but he paid for his temerity with his life, when the blacks by treacherous arts procured his death. Along with his brother and two shepherds he was occupying a hut near the Murray. While fencing and building were going forward the blacks came about the place and were well received, being paid for any services they rendered. On the 22nd of August 1846 half-a-dozen of them had slept on the premises, and in the morning were supplied with breakfast. While they were busy with their meal one of them \" cooeyed,\" and Andrew Beveridge went out to see what was the matter, when two of the blacks who were standing with their spears ready, discharged them, and both of them entered the young squatter's body, killing him instantaneously. His brother was absent at the time, and when the shepherds saw a mob of natives rush from the neighbouring scrub, they threw themselves on their horses and gallopped for their lives. The younger Mr. Beveridge and Mr. French, the magistrate from the Grange, subsequently captured two of the murderers, whose fate we shall describe hereafter. A branch of the stream of settlement had flowed west from the Avoca River, and Allan Cameron, Captain Harrison, Horsfall, Stewart, Cay and Kaye, Folcy and Cameron, Coutts, Rutherford, Donald and Hamilton, and others went out as far as they could go to the edge of the mallee scrub. Thus was the country covered from end to end with an industrious population, busy in their pastoral pursuits. In the middle of 1846 there were close upon a thousand distinct stations in Victoria, on which were engaged about six thousand men, and in addition 117 convicts whose term of bondage was not yet expired. That these stations were now becoming no longer the rude dwellings of young men who dwelt in bachelor fashion, is shown by the fact that nearly two thousand females were resident upon them, an unequal proportion to the six thousand males, no doubt, but indicating clearly enough that the squatting districts were becoming comfortably settled. Sometimes the ladies of these early days had opportunities of showing their nerve, and though there is no record of a woman having lost her life by reason of the blacks, they often enough had cause for alarm. Some of these resolute ladies who accompanied their husbands into the wilds were for several years accustomed to wear or keep near them loaded pistols for any sudden chance that might arise, and if they were inclined to grow remiss, the arrival from one of the out-stations of a stiffened corpse, all that was left of some unfortunate shepherd, whose head had been battered in, whose hut had been plundered by the \" tame blacks\" about the station prior to their disappearance into the bush, would stimulate their caution and remind them of the proximity of danger. In 1846 the squatters had nearly three millions of sheep ; they had more than a quarter of a million of cattle ; they had twelve thousand horses. In short, the country was settled ; we shall hear no more of pioneers ; in ten busy years a country more extensive than Great Britain had been converted from its loneliness \u2014 beautiful, but sad and full of regret while so many of mankind were starving \u2014 into the fairest pastoral region of the world, exporting its ten million pounds per annum of the most highly-priced wools that the markets of London had ever seen."], [251, "portraits of 16 aboriginals from coranderrk station taken in 1S86.\u2014 (See note at cud of chapter.)

They were first Ww3 illl-'J I col(,niscd in 1837, at a time when the prolonged agitation of the emancipation \u2014 ' party had just secured the freedom of the negro; and during at least the later years of that memorable conflict the question of the treatment of the aboriginal inhabitants of colonies had come prominently before the public. The atrocious evils of the past were brought out in all their horror, and the savagery shown by well-armed white men in dealing with comparatively defenceless savages was depicted from many a platform with eloquence that roused great audiences to righteous outbursts of indignation. All classes of men had shown this species of wantonness. The Catholic Spaniard, tamely submissive to his sovereign, had slaughtered the West Indians as heathens the world was well rid of. The New England Puritans, though sturdy in defence of their own liberty, enduring much to secure for themselves their rights as men, had gone out in grim array to destroy the Indian tribes with indiscriminate massacre, and had held prayer meetings on the scene of slaughter to invoke God's favour on what the)- considered to be His work."], [252, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 230 Vastly different was the tone of men's minds in the days when Victoria was colonised. In 1834 there could be no doubt as to the temper of the English nation. In the Address which the House of Commons presented to King William IV. in reply to his speech on opening Parliament in the July of that year, there occurs this notable passage: \u2014 \"Your faithful Commons in Parliament assembled are deeply impressed with the duty of acting upon principles of justice and humanity in the intercourse and relations of this country with the native inhabitants of the colonial settlements,\" and they humbly pray His Majesty that he would be pleased to take such steps as will secure a kindly treatment of the natives and the spread of civilisation among them. Such an expression of opinion compelled the cabinet then in office to take the most extreme care in dealing with this difficult question, and for six or eight years afterwards it was a prominent matter in the policy of the Colonial Office, all the more so as the genera feeling in England was so intense. That feeling destroyed its own usefulness in some measure by being hysterical. Those who maintained a general theory that the white men had no right to invade the territory of the inferior race, were expending their rhetoric in trying to convince practical men of a proposition to which they did not well know how to reply, but of which their common sense made them suspect the fallacy. If there is any justice whatever in the democratic position that an aristocrat in England or in France had no right to monopolize \u2014 all to his own use \u2014 a territory of twenty, thirty, or forty square miles, \u2014 if it was felt that however the ultimate good of society forbids the sudden and revolutionary alteration of the distribution of property \u2014 yet there was much to be said against the glaring disparity in the amount of territory of which a child became possessed by virtue of inheritance, \u2014 then what could the oratorical party urge as the reason why each adult black man in Victoria should remain in perpetuity the sole and indefeasible owner of three hundred and fifty square miles to support himself, his wife, and an average of two children ? If the white man could without difficulty contrive to make these three hundred and fifty square miles support ten persons to the square mile, there would be 3500 persons resident thereon, and it would amply repay so numerous a community to maintain the naked savage, his wife, and two children, in a state of comfort utterly unattainable when he had to hunt over so wide an area for their scanty subsistence. That, in principle, was the policy adopted in the early colonisation of Victoria. In practice it was a failure ; partly from causes that no one could have avoided ; partly, as we shall see, because the convict element in Australia did not suffer the attempt to be carried out under favourable auspices. Long before the experiment was tried, there had been an antagonistic element at work all along the sea-coast. Those sealers left by vessels on the islands were mostly men who had been formerly convicts, and those who were not, were at least of much the same class. They had no women with them. They lived a lonely life, in which the passions of their sensual and low-class natures would become motive powers of singular strength. To secure the native women they risked their lives with reckless daring, and by a mixture of courage, cunning, and ferocity, either secured the objects of their brutish desires, or left their own bodies riddled with spears at the native encampment they had invaded. We may say that such scenes were a disgrace to the white men. So they were ; but anyone who has the least notion of the back-slum life of cities, or of the moral notions of a seaman of sixty years ago, will regard them as the inevitable result to be expected. Nor would the natives themselves regard them as in any way unnatural."], [253, "THE TREATMENT OF THE ABORIGINALS.\u2014 1838 TO 1846. 231 Such a practice was the well-known and fully-justifiable custom of their own race from time immemorial. Unfortunately, the advent of this blackguard sort of crew upon our shores did not permit the natives to gather an elevated notion in the first instance of their white visitors. They saw only men of the same unlovely morals as themselves, who were willing to kill and be killed for the possession of females as property. Thus, each black tribe took up against the whites the same attitude of defiance and hostility that it exhibited towards its neighbour tribes. That the Port Phillip Association was able to make itself so friendly with the Geelong and Yarra natives, is mainly due to the address of John Batman and to the discovery of William Buckley. Its intentions with regard to the blacks were eminently philanthropic ; but when it failed to secure the monopoly it hoped for, there came a crowd of settlers who, though anxious themselves to secure for the natives a kindly treatment, were yet too little careful of the class of servants they brought over to have any great chance of success. John H. Wedge was the first of the settlers who actively stirred himself to secure for the natives something like fair-play. Immediately after his occupation of his run at the Werribee he wrote to the Colonial Secretary at Hobart complaining of a wanton attack made on the blacks at Western Port. Some low fellows, the crew of a vessel that had gone thither to collect wattle bark, had longed for the possession of women. They had stolen upon a native encampment at sunrise, and though they did not succeed in their desire, they severely wounded four of the natives before the tribe escaped. This same tribe complained that a year and a-half previously four of their women had been carried off from them by force.' It is difficult to see what the authorities could have done till the country grew more settled, for these fellows could land where they pleased, and act as their callous natures prompted them, without the least fear of their being convicted by any court of law, so long as they did not quarrel among themselves. Hence the experiment was badly prejudiced ere ever it was begun. And what chance was there of its being successful so long as the only class of servants to be had in the colony consisted of convicts, whose notions of morality, whose standard of female honour, had been gathered in the dens of London and Liverpool and Glasgow? Yet these men, in the nature of the case, had to be sent out some miles from supervision to live the loneliest of lives in the forest without women of their own, but visited from time to time by roving families with naked women among them. Under the circumstances it was impossible that these men could steal black women from the tribes as the sealers had done who lived on islands. Had they attempted it, and been strong enough to effect it, their employers would have summarily checked the practice. But they made conquests of their female visitors by wheedling ways and the display of enticing presents. It has often been asserted that the white men debauched and corrupted the innocence of the native women. That seems absolutely false. The evidence is perfectly conclusive that the women had no innocence of that sort. In answer to a circular sent out in later years by a Royal Commission of Victoria fourteen gentlemen reply, among many other questions, to one which begins\u2014\" Is chastity cultivated among the women?\" These gentlemen were all such as had known the natives well in all conditions. Twelve of them answer that there is no notion of chastity among them-; one declares that among themselves they have some modest)-, but with regard to white men none whatsoever; and the fourteenth, the guardian of the natives, who was with them from the very first, and fought their battle with fervid zeal, cannot bring himself to answer more 'Wedge's account is printed in Bonwick's \"Port Phillip Settlement,\" p. 506. Vol. I. 2K"], [254, "VICTORIA AND ITS METRO POLLS: PAST AND PRESENT. 232 favourably than that \" chastity is to a certain extent cultivated.\" In the House of Commons Reports, printed in 1844, will be found some three hundred and fifty pages relative to the blacks of Victoria \u2014 letters, reports, memoranda by hundreds of different observers, and all tell the same tale.\" One worthy missionary says that the \" conduct of the females, even young chil dren, is most painful.\" He declares that they are \" cradled in prostitution and fostered in licentiousness.\" Their conduct, even under his very instruction, was such as he could not dare to write for a respectable public. The missionaries, no doubt, always overdrew their pictures ; they were enthusiastic men of warm hearts, or they could not have remained at their posts, and that fervour of feeling makes them sometimes too sweeping in their testimony. We cannot doubt that there were many women among the blacks whose conduct was on the whole seemly, but as a rule they were ready enough to offer themselves to the shepherds and stockmen on the out stations. Unfortunately these latter were not men of gentlemanly feeling, but common fellows with common instincts. The temptation when it came would find in them no pretence of resistance, the only obstacle in the case being the discontent of the black men. But it seems clear from abundant evidence that this difficulty was easily enough removed, for the husbands and fathers accepted the white men's gifts as an ample equivalent. It seems not unlikely that the most desperate revenges taken by the blacks on the white men arose from the non-payment of this nefarious tribute by the shepherds, or from their inability to comply with the increasing tariff imposed by the males of the adjoining tribes. This state of affairs was well known to the authorities of the colony, but it is hard to see what they could have done to prevent it, so long as there was full consent among all the parties. It sometimes happened, however, that the white men would purchase or steal a woman and forcibly detain her. That was a matter in which the Government could interfere. In 1837 a proclamation was published, and in 1839 it was reprinted and made known to all the squatters, wherein it was stated that if the holder of a license, or his overseer, was known to have detained, or permitted his men to detain, the black women of the district at their huts, the license would be at once withdrawn. Unfortunately there were a few cases known in which the employers themselves joined their men in these degraded practices, for in the first year or two there came a few squatters here and there who had sprung from the convict ranks, and who set a bad example to those around them ; but sooner or later the majority of these had their licenses withdrawn. If we allow that there was really no corruption of the native women, the state of affairs becomes merely an illustration of the low moral tone prevalent in the inferior types of humanity, and any great city of the old world could have shown a hundred-fold more immorality than existed on these lonely stations. But the pity of it was that these convict shepherds were mostly men who had been steeped in the vices of these great cities, and brought out to this sunny land, not merely degraded minds, but also bodies tainted with indelible disease, which they transmitted to the unfortunate women of the tribes. Among these the poison spread with incredible virulence, and therein lay the first of half-a-dozen causes that marked the race from the very first for inevitable destruction. Unfortunately the disease spread so widely that it never could afterwards be stamped out, though so far as the white men were concerned it might have terminated in 1842 and 1843. For at that time the arrival of respectable immigrants by thousands cast a different complexion on the morals of the bush, and not only did the expiree convicts die of disease themselves and of their annual month of drunkenness, and so become a race not readily to be met with, but also by a - Report, 1844, P- Go*"], [255, "THE TREATMENT OF THE ABORIGINALS.-1838 TO 1S46. \u25a0> 1 ? preponderance of respectable men in the bush the evil ways of the past times were gradually discountenanced, and the blacks often saved from the dangers of their own ignorance. The second of the causes mentioned as having led to the extinction of the blacks was the shooting of the men in affrays that rose in various ways. But with only one notable exception the aboriginals who were thus shot met their death in fights in which, whatever the original source of contention, the first blow was struck by themselves. When Victoria was settled it was well known that a change had taken place in the views of the public as to the indiscriminate shooting of aboriginal races ; it was well known that the British Government was resolved to protect them, and the fact that early in 1838 eleven men in New South Wales were put on their trial for shooting blacks at the Gwydir River, and that, of these, seven had been hanged, made the convict servants and others understand that the killing of a black man, save for self-defence, would thenceforth be treated and punished as murder. But all the same, the black men were slowly exterminated in the war of races. If they drove off a flock of sheep from some station, the squatter pursued them ; they turned to defend the stolen property ; the squatter, aware of the state of the law, would endeavour by pacific means to obtain possession of his sheep ; the blacks would throw a spear or two ; the conflict would begin, and a crowd of blacks be left who could not be regarded as murdered, though they were none the less dead. The most notable case of this sort was the conflict between the Whytc Brothers and the natives on the Wannon. A tribe had appeared at the station and surreptitiously driven off some hundreds of sheep. The owners and some friends, five gentlemen in all, with four men belonging to the run, started in pursuit, but they were no sooner come within reach of missiles than a shower of spears was thrown, of which one passed through a gentleman's leg. It seemed clear that the blacks were resolved to defend the sheep they had taken. The white men fired a volley, and a general fight began ; it lasted about an hour, and resulted in the death of thirty-six blacks, none of the white men being seriously wounded. The Whytes duly reported the circumstance to the authorities. The matter was put into the hands of Mr. Croke, the Crown Prosecutor, but after due inquiry he came to the conclusion that there was no case. For it had been settled in the law courts that if the Crown issued to anyone a license to depasture his flocks in a certain district he had a perfect right to defend them with arms against robbers who came in arms to remove them. There was, therefore, no trial, although it was with some show of justice maintained that several of the blacks had been shot when the conflict was really over and the sheep recovered. This, indeed, was often the case in these skirmishes. However, it is not easy when sitting in comfort, with the blood stirred by none of that strong throbbing which attends a sense of danger, to say exactly where we would ourselves have drawn the line had we been involved in such a conflict. That was the worst collision which took place in Victoria ; but in the same year, 1840, Mr. Samuel Winter had a sharp skirmish with the natives, in which five of them fell. There were scores of minor skirmishes, each resulting in the death of two or three natives, but those reports are absolutely false which describe the settlers as being in the habit of shooting the natives in cold blood. There have been writers who, in an indiscreet sort of indignation, have allowed themselves to give currency to assertions with little foundation. Mr. G. W. Rusden, for instance, asserts that in some cases poisoning was resorted to, and that arsenic 3 was mixed with the flour given to the natives. He declares that a \" medical man, a pastoral tenant, gained bad eminence for perpetrating a wholesale murder of this kind near 3 \"History of Australia,\" vol. II., p, 224."], [256, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 234 the Eumeralla River at the North os Port Fairy.\" But he has nothing to rely on for such an assertion but the vaguest of rumours. In Latrobe's despatch of 17th March 1.843, he writes that there is some ground for believing that at Dr. Kilgour's run, near Port Fairy, a number of blacks had been poisoned, but that it was impossible to obtain more than a suspicion as to the settler whom rumour described as the perpetrator. It was asserted that three men, three women, and three children, had thus met their death and that their bodies had been burnt. But Latrobe sent a magistrate to inquire into the rumour, and that magistrate found nothing to substantiate such a charge ; at least he reported that \" the information in this supposed case of poisoning is very unsatisfactory.\" Yet Mr. Rusden is incautious enough to accept the story as true, though at the time there was nothing but rumour to support it. Moreover, it was the only rumour of the kind that was ever put in circulation. We may therefore dismiss the story of wholesale poisonings as being unwarranted. The origin of such stories and the manner in which they are fanned into vitality, is shown by an occurrence of the year 1841. A Wesleyan missionary, Mr. Hurst, a man of great worth but little sagacity, delivered a lecture in Launceston describing the horrors that were going forward from week to week among the natives of Port Phillip, and how it was the custom on Sundays for the men, and sometimes for the squatters themselves, to take out their guns, and under pretence of kangaroo shooting, to stalk the natives in the bush and lay them low like so much game. This lecture appeared in the newspapers, and roused the usual thrill in the breasts of humane readers. It caused some little sensation in the colonies, and necessarily attracted the attention of Latrobe, who was in ignorance of any atrocities of the kind. When Mr. Hurst returned to his mission station on the Barwon, Latrobe wrote to him asking for more specific information. Mr. Hurst replied, reiterating the charges, but stating that he spoke not from his own knowledge, but from information received. Latrobe demanded the name of his informant, in order that such scoundrelly conduct might be duly investigated. Mr. Hurst replied in vague terms. Latrobe insisted on having the name, when the missionary gave it, and the bubble burst. The gentleman, whose name it is not now worth while to drag from obscurity, was a noted boaster, the Falstaff of the Western district, whose braggadoccio conversation was wont to amuse and then disgust his neighbours of the Portland Bay district. Latrobe had heard of him and his Munchausen inventions. He did not think the matter would have seriously required refutation but for the public talk that had arisen ; however, he directed Mr. Blair, the police magistrate at Portland, to inquire and report. That gentleman first waited on the original informant, who stated that he had never told Mr. Hurst anything of the kind ; that what he did say had been grossly exaggerated by the missionary. However, the testimony of the residents of the district tended to exonerate the missionary from any such charge, for it was clearly made out that this talking fellow had been in the habit of amusing his acquaintances with stories of that very kind, in which he himself generally figured as a slayer of thousands. According to his own account his station was infested by blacks in incredible numbers, so that he, the valiant squatter, found it necessary to use at least a pound of gunpowder per day in merely thinning them off. There seemed to be no doubt but that he had actually told Mr. Hurst all that had been asserted in the lecture, and yet in conversation with a missionary he had been artful enough to suppress the record of his own prowess and attribute the horrors of the district to those ruthless demons \u2014 his neighbours. Mr. Hurst had, however, been glad enough to accept these stories without further proof, and had unconsciously coloured them in the redeliverance so as to produce a most sinister effect on the public mind."], [257, "THE TREATMENT OF THE ABORIGINALS.-1838 TO 1846. 235 When Mr. Blair had furnished his report, stating that the allegations of the lecture were utterly untrue, Latrobe wrote to Mr. Hurst a severe rebuke, which he concluded thus,-\"I deprecate in you, or any other really conscientious man, any imitation, even in appearance, of the claptrap unfortunately so much in vogue in our native country, where, in aid even of a holy cause, the most palpable fiction is not discountenanced if it ministers to the popular impulse.\" There was one good effect from this agitation. It cleared the Portland Bay settlers from accusations that might have still been blindly afloat. The evidence was taken of the leading residents. Stephen Henty said that he knew of no case where natives had been killed, except during attacks which they themselves had made on the white men. The first collision of that kind took place in 1839, when a number of natives approached a hut upon an out-station. The hut-keeper, distrusting their look, turned and retreated to the hut, but they chased him, and the foremost entered the hut along with him. He had just time to seize his gun when the black was upon him. He raised the weapon; the native seized it by the muzzle to push it aside and deal a blow with his club; but at that moment the trigger was pulled and the ball passed through the black man's body. The natives were checked for a moment; the hut-keeper took advantage of the pause to escape, and while they plundered the hut he reached the home station. When a relief party returned they found that the natives had decamped, all but the wounded man, who had carried a large damper out of the place, but had only gone a few yards with it when the wound took effect. He had sat down upon the damper and there died, still in a sitting posture. His body was sound already stiffening. In the next collision, it was a white man only who lost his life. The blacks had thrown him off his guard by a stratagem ; one of them asked to have his hair cut with the white man's scissors, and whilst the hut-keeper was humoring his desire, the others suddenly brained him. Two affrays had taken place due to attacks from the natives, but in these only they themselves had suffered. Mr. Blair took the testimony of twelve other settlers, equally well-known and as highly respected as Mr. Henty, and they had all the same report to give, that it was utterly untrue that any one in the district had ever shot blacks like kangaroos, and that all the deaths that had taken place occurred in conflicts provoked by the natives themselves. At a later date than this, however, there happened one case of wanton massacre near Port Fairy \u2014 a disgraceful affair that stirred the indignation of everyone in the country. It seems that two natives, with their wives, two other females and two children, were sleeping in a tea-tea scrub one evening, when six or eight white men rode up, surrounded them, and fired upon them with pistols. The men escaped, and a woman, though wounded, managed to carry off a child; but three women and a child were found dead next morning by a party of white men led thither by the fugitives. No trace could be found for a long time of the murderers; ;\u00a3ioo reward was offered, and pardon for an accomplice. It was then that a low fellow came forward and stated that he had been present and had taken a minor part in the murder, but that three persons named Hill, Bates and Beswicke had been the principals in the transaction. Hill was the manager of the station on which the occurrence took place. Bates and Beswicke had been visitors. The evidence against them seemed consistent enough, but the main witness was a man of the worst possible character. His testimony was shown in various details to be unreliable, and the jury, taking into account the fact that he was a kind of man who would not scruple to see three men hanged if it would bring him ,\u00a3100, gave the prisoners, though with misgivings, the benefit of the doubt."], [258, "236 VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. Judge Jeffcott, who tried the case, assured the prisoners that, had they been convicted, hanged they most certainly should have been, without the slightest hope of mercy. This threat had no doubt a salutary influence, but by this time, in the year 1843, there was but little need for it. Of the 24,000 people in the colony, at least 18,000 were immigrants from the old country, and the convict class was held in check by a more respectable body of sentiment. There was, therefore, only one case ever known in Victoria of the massacre of natives in mere wantonness; but their deaths from gun-shot wounds obtained in conflicts with the white men were distressingly numerous; no less than fifty-three were known to have thus fallen in a single year in the Portland Bay district alone. That, however, was in the days when none were shepherds but emancipated convicts. How rapid the change was, is shown by the fact that in the year and a-half ending January 1842 not a single black in all that district lost his life at the white man's hands. There were two good reasons for the change; one, that with a more respectable class of men there was less intercourse with the native women, and so less occasion for quarrels; the other, that the blacks had learnt the supremacy of the white man's weapons, and found that sheep were too dear at the cost which had to be paid for them. It is well that the early settlers of Victoria can clear themselves of the accusation of having wantonly destroyed the blacks. The utmost that can be said is that they sometimes, though not generally, were to blame for the quarrels that arose, and that when a fight took place they sometimes abused the opportunity which their firearms gave them. The wish of the community, however, was to save the native tribes, and deal justly by them. It will be remembered that when Batman's Association came over they brought with them Dr. Thomson as surgeon and catechist to take charge of the blacks in the Port Phillip district. The rapid influx of other settlers disarranged this plan. Dr. Thomson devoted himself to pastoral pursuits, although he did not altogether forget the interests of the blacks. But his place was at once taken by a missionary. Mr. George Langhorne arrived in December 1836, sent from Sydney by Governor Bourke. A NATIVE SHEPHERD. A piece of land on the south side of the Yarra, now occupied by the Botanical Gardens, was assigned him, and John Thomas Smith, afterwards well-known in Melbourne, was sent to be his assistant. But as the neighbouring township grew and presented fatal attractions to the natives, the situation was found unsuitable, and the establishment, after three years of feeble existence, was discontinued. The Wcsleyans made a much more determined effort of the same sort. At the head of the Barwon, beyond the station of Mr. Ricketts, out in the wild country\u2014 though now occupied by the township of Birregurra\u2014 they formed in 1836 their mission station of Buntingdalc. Mr. Hurst and Mr. Tuckfield laboured there for many years, zealously but in sorrow, for their labours were like those of him \"who limns in water or who writes in"], [259, "THE TREATMENT OF THE ABORIGINALS.\u2014 1838 TO 1846. 237 dust.\" The good they effected was only visible to the eye of faith, and that for a month or two at a time ; then even the most ardent heart had to confess that it was utterly evanescent. This mission station received in six years \u00a34500 of public money, and so long as it was thus assisted the missionaries had to render periodical reports. It is pathetic to read in these reports, from time to time, the slow decay of noble dreams and ardent aspirations. The missionaries at one time have a gleam of hope when half-a-dozen children have been induced to stay with them for a few months at a time ; these little folks are smart enough, and are learning steadily. Next report shows that they are all gone, no one knows whither. The usual process at the station was that a family or small tribe appeared in dirt and squalor; the good people of the place washed them, and put clean shirts and trousers on the men, gowns and white pinafores on the women. A daily ration was served to them. They stayed about the place for a month or two, perhaps three, or even four. During that time a few were induced to learn their alphabet, and all of them were taught, to some little extent at least, to join in singing a hymn. When they were tired of so long a habitation in one spot, the missionaries saw them, without a word of explanation or regret, pack up their effects. They defiled slowly out of view, leaving the missionaries and missionaries' wives to gaze from their verandahs in silent distress as they disappeared beyond the sunny expanses of woodland. For some months the mission station was probably empty ; or perhaps a stray black, or two or three children might be brought in by the exertions of Mr. Hurst or Mr. Tuckfield, or a wounded or sick individual might present himself unsought ; but the place was mostly deserted, until in the fulness of time the wanderers would return, looking draggled and woe-begone, their clothes thrown away, their blankets conglomerate with filth, and their bodies again in sad want of soap and the wash-tub. The patient missionaries received them again and again, but they were like spoiled and self-willed children. They took all that was given them without thanks, and followed their own inclinations without the least regard for the wishes of their benefactors. Strange to say, the mission station, in an indirect way, led to the destruction of the blacks. The native tribes, at the time of the white men's arrival, maintained the most deadly feuds among themselves ; but they had abundance of room to keep out of each other's way. A weaker tribe, separated by forty or fifty miles from the habitat of a stronger one, could preserve itself by constant watchfulness. Now, however, the white man's intrusion had completely unsettled all their districts; and the more aggressive tribes found their enemies an easier prey. The missionaries lament that the gathering of the blacks of many tribes to the mission station, even though they came but at times in the hope of rations, had the effect of laying the milder tribes at the mercy of the fiercer. That terrible superstition of the natives which made them believe that no one could die without the evil machinations of some enemy, led them to seek the revenge of blood wherever it could be shed, and the Wesleyan station at Buntingdale unfortunately formed a fixed locality wherein it was always easy to find a native for slaughter. Indeed, the blacks sometimes took their victims from the very heart of the station, from the very shelter of the mission walls. In July 1 84 1 the place was startled by the arrival of 200 blacks. They wished to avenge the death of an elderly man of their district, and must have blood. They wanted the kidney-fat of some one or other of the blacks about the mission station. The missionaries were unarmed. They could do nothing by moral suasion, and had to look on helplessly while one of their pupils for the time being was relentlessly thrust through and through with man)-"], [260, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 238 spears. And when the invaders were so far satisfied, they made a demand for women ; they wandered up and down brandishing their weapons and threatening the brains of all at the station if the women were not surrendered. At length the blacks then living at the station agreed to give up one woman, with whom the bullying crowd departed. For a long time an episode of this sort deterred the smaller tribes of blacks from approaching the station. They said they were safer in the bush unless the missionaries could defend them. And so the weatherboard cottages contained two missionaries, who had nothing to do ; the little chapel saw only six small boys brought in to morning service, and the row of sheds where the blacks were expected to camp stood empty for months, till at last the experiment was abandoned, Mr. Hurst acknowledging it a hopeless failure. But Mr. Tuckfield was not easily defeated in the task of kindness he had set before himself. He thought he could do more by taking up his abode in the midst of a single tribe, and isolating it from all others. At first he seemed to have some hopes of success in a scheme that involved such hardships as only the most exalted zeal could have induced any one to endure. He had some sort of result for a time from his labours with the boys and young people of the tribe ; but their tinge of civilisation was only a temporary phase in their lives. It passed away as they grew to manhood, and left but little trace.4 In 1845 the Baptists made an effort on a similar scale ; they built a schoolhouse at the Merri Creek, and tried to educate the black children of the neighbourhood. There the little boys and girls, neatly clad, were diligently trained in the subjects of an ordinary elementary education. It is recorded that an exhibition given in Collins-street, at the Scots' Church, delighted the public with the proficiency they exhibited in reading and singing. But this attempt also was futile. The good little children of tender years were no sooner grown to be on the verge of manhood or womanhood than they showed their descent. They became wilful savages, and betook themselves to the bush ; threw away their clothing, and joined the wandering lives of their kindred. And if private efforts were without fruit, as little result came of the great Government system which cost about \u00a360,000, and left the natives worse than it found them. And yet the attempt was meritorious, and the theory of it not unsatisfactory. In 1836 and the following years the constant burden of the instructions received by the Governors at Sydney had been to take great care of the aborigines. Glenelg never lost a chance of reminding Gipps of the wishes of the Government in that matter. Lord John Russell tells him \u2014 \" You cannot overrate the solicitude of Her Majesty's Government on the subject of the aborigines of New Holland.\" But Lord John Russell's instructions were written at a considerable distance from the scene of operations, and when he directed Gipps to see that the \" boys should be taught to di\u00b0- and plough, and should learn the trades of shoemakers and tailors, and carpenters and masons, while the girls should learn to sew and cook, to wash linen and dust furniture,\" the worthy Governor must have felt anxious for some sort of notion as to how it was all to be done. But the Colonial Office relieved him of that responsibility. It had a scheme of its own ; and accordingly, in December 1837, Lord Glenelg appointed five protectors who were to take up their abode among the blacks ; to act as their friends ; to use every means of protecting them and terminating their wars among themselves ; and to civilise them by every influence in their power. The expense of the scheme presented no difficulty, for at that period the land sales were flourishing, and some of the settlers, among whom were Mr. J. II. Wedge and Dr. Thomson had already suggested that a portion of that fund should be employed for the benefit of the House of Commons Papers, 1844."], [261, "THE TREATMENT OF THE ABORIGINALS.-1838 TO 1S46. 239 blacks. It was indeed settled that a sum approximately equal to fifteen per cent, of the total land fund should be set apart yearly for the maintenance of this protectorate scheme, which was to be on a somewhat elaborate scale. The position of Chief Protector of the Aborigines was given to George Augustus Robinson, a choice by no means wise, but easily enough to be understood ; for he had gained a great, though temporary, reputation by reason of his success with the natives of Tasmania. He had been originally but a bricklayer in Hobart, though one who had always shown a philanthropic desire to benefit his fellows, spending his leisure as a Wesleyan lay preacher among the sailors and expiree convicts. But he emerged from his obscurity on the occasion of his offer to go unarmed into the native camps and induce the tribes to surrender to the white men. He had carried out what was originally considered a boast. He had persuaded all that were left of the ill-fated race of Tasmania to lay down their weapons and accompany him to Hobart. No doubt his services were unduly magnified by that magic of circumstances which sometimes, in an unaccountable way, converts a commonplace-man into all the semblance of a hero. Years of labour and expense had already been spent by the people of Tasmania in their effort to capture the natives, and Batman had gained some reputation for success in it. Robinson, however, had all the appearance of bringing it to a successful issue, when he gathered the last one hundred and sixty natives in submission to the Government ; but, as has been remarked by Bonwick,\"' the expenditure of thirty thousand pounds in the famous \"line movement,\" when a cordon of men advancing across the island drove the blacks before them, though it did not succeed in the capture of more than one person, yet rendered plain to the hunted remnants of the black tribes the enormous preponderance of the power they were fighting against. However, it was the kindhearted Robinson who reaped the triumph, and conducted the natives to their asylum in Flinders Island. In recognition of his services he had been appointed to the command of the natives' settlement in that island, but he was not a man suited for any such work. Slow of ideas, but of many, and frequently tedious words; afflicted with a kindly egotism, and a slightly fatuous belief in his own importance, he failed to rule his little community with sufficient wisdom. This, however, was not realised so far away as in England, and Lord Glenelg, seeking for some one who might play the part of the natives' friend in the wider sphere of Port Phillip, naturally selected the man who had gained himself the title of the Conciliator in Tasmania. He was to have a salary of \u00a3500 a-year, and under him there were to be four assistant protectors at salaries of \u00a3250 per annum each, with allowances for maintenance and travelling. These were appointed in England, and landed in Melbourne during the course of the year 1838. That part of the colony which was then settled was divided into four districts, to each of which an assistant protector was assigned. Mr. Charles W. Sievewright was appointed to the Geelong and Western District; Edward S. Parker to the Mount Macedon district ; William Thomas to the Western Port District ; and James Dredge to the Goulburn River District. Their appointment was in some respects a matter of regret to Gipps and Latrobe, who would have preferred young and active men who could have traversed their districts constantly and with activity. On the contrary, the four assistant protectors were all men with large families, whom they were loth to leave for months together ; they seem to have been very ready to work as missionaries, and to have had every intention of giving the natives a large amount of good advice and plenty of instruction, if they would only be good children, and come to get it. But for the rough work, the 5 \" The Lost Tasmanian Race,\" p. 14S. Vol. I. 2 F"], [262, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 240 interminable travelling, the long, slow, year-absorbing patience of following up the wandering tribes, and humouring the wilful, unstable, and capricious men and women who composed it, they were all very indifferently adapted. Such a criticism involves no reflection on their general ability, but in the very nature of the case, it was impossible that men could be found really efficient who landed in the colonies as perfect strangers to colonial ways, and with roseate views of a missionary's life which in the first place could scarcely have been realised anywhere, and in the second place were wholly inconsistent with the views taken by the authorities in the colonies as to the function of protectors. Landing as they did with no knowledge of the native dialects, the first year or so was of little service; it was merely probationary. It was mostly occupied in building slab cottages and superintending the arrival of furniture in bullock drays over long journeys without roads. There were constant communications with the Governor \u2014 complaints as to amounts of money allowed for travelling ; pathetic descriptions of the woes they have come to, as contrasted with the comforts they left in England. Gipps, in one of his despatches, assures Lord John Russell that the quantity of correspondence forwarded by the protectors was in itself an evil of no little magnitude. Mr. Robinson, the chief protector, resided in Melbourne, and was supposed to manage the department. He mainly busied himself in writing reports. Gipps refers to one as containing 320 pages of foolscap, with copious appendices \u2014 that was Robinson's half-yearly report, enclosing others of more reasonable magnitude from the assistant protectors. It is said that on Gipps' retirement from office, there was found a considerable bundle of reports that had never been opened. The efficiency of the protectors manifestly improved at a subsequent date, but the system was from the first doomed to be a failure. Mr. James Dredge retired from the work at an early period. In February 1838 he wrote from the Goulburn River a long description of the hardships suffered on the voyage to Australia ; his disappointment in the colony ; the want of comfort he experienced with his large family on this remote station, and the inadequacy of his salary. He therefore resigned his position, stating that he had been dissatisfied with it from the beginning. Gipps wrote a sharp reply. He knew very well, he said, that Air. Dredge had been dissatisfied from the beginning. So, in fact, had been all the protectors ; but the position was not of his making. All the stipulations had been fully known to them before they left England, and had been fully complied with in the colony. Gipps stated that Mr. Dredge could resign if he liked, but he wished to point out that up to that date Mr. Dredge had cost from \u00a3800 to \u00a31000 of public money, for which he had as yet given no service ; nor could he do so until he had acquired a little of the native languages. It was therefore unfair that he should wish to resign now that there was a more reasonable prospect of his being useful. Nevertheless, Mr. Dredge resigned ; and in his place there was appointed Mr. William Le Souef, a younger and more active man, who made the protectorate more of a reality on the Goulburn River district than in any other. About \u00a31700 worth of provisions, blankets and clothing, were annually distributed among the natives, and so far as these attracted the natives they came under the influence of the protectors ; but only for short periods. For at the protectorate stations they were expected to do something in the way of work in return for what was given them, or at any rate they were placed under the restraint of some little instruction. But the towns afforded to the natives all they could get at the stations without any such restriction. Mr. Thomas complained in most of his reports that he could do nothing so long as the natives were allowed to visit Melbourne. If they went there they begged upon the streets, and the inhabitants gave"], [263, "THE TREATMENT OF THE ABORIGINALS.-1838 TO 1846. 241 them provisions and old clothing, and what suited the black man still better, they gave him sixpences. Then, though the law was strict against the publicans who served the natives with liquor, and their licenses were withdrawn if they were known to do so, yet the natives could easily contrive a hundred ways of getting it so long as they had money to pay for it. Mr. Thomas complains, therefore, exactly as the Wesleyan missionaries did, that the aboriginal tribes never visited him unless when provisions were growing scarce, or when they had become wearied out after a long period of drinking. The protectors were never acquainted with more than 860 natives, and of these there were at the close of 1840 about 400 hanging round the outskirts of Melbourne, camped in scattered parties near the Yarra from Hawthorn to Heidelberg. These subsisted by the sale of small articles in the streets of Melbourne, by begging, and by theft. Their depredations were then becoming intolerable, and a few who had obtained firearms had stationed themselves near the main roads and begun to demand sixpences with a saucy and sometimes with a menacing air, which made them practically robbers. This state of things came to a sudden close at the end of 1840. Major Lettsom had been despatched from Sydney with a corporal and three mounted troopers to inquire into the attack made on Mr. G. E. Mackay. While at the Ovens he heard that the large crowd of blacks on the outskirts of Melbourne were in a particularly restless condition, a number of wild natives having arrived from the east, and preparations having been made in consequence for a big fight. He had no instructions to interfere, but as there was nothing to be done at the Ovens, he thought it would be well to go forward to Melbourne and take command of a force to disperse the gathering natives. Latrobe was glad to see him, and gave him the services of twelve mounted troopers. Major Lettsom could also call out the military stationed in the place, consisting of Captain Smith, Lieutenant Vignolles, and twenty-five privates of the 28th Regiment. The)- marched out a mile or two to the north, but found the first encampment deserted. Here they were met by Protector Thomas, who asked the officer in charge : \" Were all these policemen and soldiers there for the purpose of catching a few blacks ? \" An altercation took place between the officer and the protector, who expressed his opinion that it was a \" sorry affair.\" Of course the diversity of opinion was natural enough. Mr. Thomas had, as yet, full belief in the merits of moral suasion. Major Lettsom, with military instincts, would have been glad if the blacks had only shown fight and made a little opening for some adventure. The soldiers came upon the second encampment, near Heidelberg, as cautiously as they could, but the blacks escaped ; some swam the river ; some dispersed into the tea-tree thickets ; but there were no prisoners taken, except some old men and a number of women and children. However, there were three muskets and a pistol found at the deserted camp, which was recognised as that of a singularly bold and threatening tribe which had twice fired upon the police during the last week or two. A day or two later, Major Lettsom heard that the blacks were again gathered at their encampments between the Darebin Creek and the River Plenty, on the Eltham road. At midnight, the streets of Melbourne again heard the tramp of the forty men, on their way to action. At daybreak they stole carefully on the sleeping camps, and effected a complete surprise. All were captured, and that with but little opportunity of resistance ; a few struggled desperately, but were overpowered : one who made a fierce attack on Lieutenant Vignolles, and was on the point of striking him down with a club, was shot dead by a trooper\u2014 the only bloodshed of the expedition. Then began a procession towards Melbourne, and that forenoon they marched down Bourke-street and up the slopes of Batman's Hill, four hundred natives\u2014"], [264, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 242 men, women, and children, a sheep-like mob in the middle, with a file of troopers on either hand acting as shepherds ; with red coats in front, and others bringing up the rear.\" APTURED NATIVE Mr. Latrobe did not well know what to do with the prisoners. He dissmissed the more inoffensive, the women, the children, and the aged men ; he put thirty-three men in goal \u2014 those who were known to be the most unruly. The rest were marched round to an empty store belonging to the commissariat department at the corner of Bourke and King streets. It was a brick building but not floored, and during the night the black men had ingenuity enough to dig beneath the walls, and come up on the other side into King-street whilst the constable who was left in charge had gone off under the impression that naked savages in a brick building were safe enough. In the morning there was not a sign of any of them. As for the thirty three in goal, they were kept there a few days, and then liberated. Although there was no severity exercised, yet the result was satisfactory. The blacks congregated in fewer numbers round Melbourne, and were much less aggressive in their conduct. Still, there was no great improvement on the protectorate stations. There, the blacks came and went as before, and the settlers complained that the protectors had in no way diminished the depredations, even of the blacks who occasionally haunted the stations. In 1840 there was a new development ; a number of leading squatters petitioned Gipps to assign large districts to the native tribes, as reserves for their sole use, and to compel them to remain within 6 Major Lettsom's Report. House of Commons Papers, 1841."], [265, "THE TREATMENT OF THE ABORIGINALS.-183S TO 1846. 243 those reserves, giving them clothing and provisions at the cost of the land fund. Immediately afterwards, Gipps replied that he thought well of the idea, and would make reserves as desired. Lord John Russell agreed to the proposal, something of the kind having occurred to himself. The Colonial office was much exercised in mind at this time, in view of the probable failure of the protectorate system, and various plans were being suggested by different experts. Captain Grey, who is still living, with a great reputation as Sir George Grey, had drawn up an elaborate scheme which was a good deal discussed at the time ; unluckily, it was much too elaborate. John H. Wedge had submitted a scheme, in which the plan of having large districts reserved for the natives was a secondary feature, the principal proposal being the payment of a bonus to every settler who should succeed in permanently civilising an aboriginal. It was very good of Mr. Wedge to take so unfailing an interest in the blacks, for they had been hard upon him. His nephew Charles, writing from the Grange, had informed him that the blacks had visited the station \u2014 which, though managed by the nephew, belonged in the main to the uncle ;\u2014 that they had taken out Mr. Wedge's favourite horse from the stable and eaten him, that they had carried off seventy ewes and one hundred and twenty-five lambs, that they had killed two cattle and wounded a great many more ; in short, they had done worth of damage in one year. Still Wedge was their friend, and said not a word against them ; but from his residence in England continued to stir up the Colonial Office in their favour. So well was the country settled at the beginning of 1841 that it was not possible to reserve a hundred square miles in each of the districts without evicting the pastoral tenants. There was a good deal of feeling evoked in the matter, as Latrobe took the choicest parts he could find, and the squatters, who held them, had to abandon their homesteads and improvements. Then in the centre of each reserve there rose the protectorate station ; a cottage for the assistant protector, his wife and family ; slab huts for the men in his service \u2014 an overseer, a bullock-driver, a carpenter, and so on. Round the dwellings there soon flourished trim gardens, and green paddocks for horses stretched out to their boundary fences.7 It was repugnant to British feelings to confine the free man of the native tribes against his will within even these spacious enclosures, but here at least was an asylum for him when in distress. Hither he could retreat if he pleased when overtaken by sickness or old age ; here he would always find food, shelter, and kindness. When the weather was good for hunting, when the game was plentiful, not a black would be seen near the station. When scarcity began to be felt they would wander in by tens or twenties from every point of the compass till, perhaps, two or three hundred would be gathered in their little encampments, and fires would burn all round the station. In the morning they were waiting for their breakfast and were allowed to defile one after another through a gate, each being supplied with a quantity of porridge as he passed. In the middle of the day they were drawn up in a long row, when they squatted on their heels to wait till the wheelbarrow came along full of pieces of beef cut to a uniform size. Each obtained his lump, watching his neighbours with suspicious eyes to see that none got any advantage ; if the meat had too much bone or too little fat they freely expressed their childish rage and petulance, and even if satisfied, they are described by an observer who saw them as being sulk)- and sometimes rebellious.\" There was a cultivation paddock attached to the protectorate stations, where the natives were supposed to assist in some useful labours, and if they had \" Curr's \"Squatting in Victoria,\" p. G6. \"\"Present State and Prospects of Port Phillip,\" by Charles Griffith, M.A., Dublin 1845."], [266, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 244 done so they might have fared more delicately, and been made more comfortable, but they never did more than a trifle, and their labour was so little to be depended on, that in farming, where everything must be done in season, they could be made of no use. In short the protectorate system was a failure. Latrobe in 1842 reported that in three years the sum of sixteen thousand pounds had been paid into the protector's department, but without any advantage to the natives. Gipps about the same time stated that the assistant protectors sent from England were most unfit, their career having been only one of feeble action and puling complaint, while the chief protector was quite unable to control a large and expensive department.9 Lord Stanley, in December of that year, wrote to Gipps that it seemed impossible any longer to deny \"that the efforts which have been hitherto made for the civilisation of the aborigines have been unavailing;\" \"that no real progress has yet been effected, and that there is no reasonable ground to expect from them greater success in future.\" He describes the complete failure of the various missions in different parts of Australia, and considers that the failure of the system of protectors has been at least as complete as that of the missions. He thinks that it is useless to continue the system, but in concluding his despatch he says, \" I cannot acquiesce in the theory that the aboriginals are incapable of improvement, and that their extinction before the advance of the white settler is a necessity which it is impossible to control. I recommend them to your protection with the greatest earnestness.\" Gipps was therefore to have the responsibility of devising something \u2014 Stanley knew not what \u2014 which was to save the blacks from extinction. But Gipps could think of no such scheme, and probably doubted if any existed. With nothing else to take its place therefore, he did not care to abolish the protectorate system, though convinced of its inutility, Protector Parker himself having reported after three years of labour, \" I see everywhere the same improvidence, the same degradation, the same gross and beastly sensuality.\" The protectorate system languished through a slow demise till 1849, when it came to an end, after costing very nearly sixty thousand pounds. Robinson returned to England with a pension ; only Mr. Thomas was retained with the title of guardian of the aboriginals, to act as agent for them, and in a certain degree to conserve their legal rights for them. There was one difficult question in reference to the blacks that was much discussed in these early years. What was to be done with the natives who were apprehended for injuries done to the white settlers ? To liberate them without punishment was unfair to the settlers, who were precluded from taking the law into their own hands. To try them after civilized fashion would be a farce, and to punish them for the infraction of laws they never knew, and did not recognise, would be injustice. It was a most complete dilemma. There could be no way out of it. And unfortunately it was one which often occurred. There was a body of police whose main business was the arrest of natives who committed depredations. In February 1839 Gipps had been greatly harassed by the receipt of reports of atrocities, and a wail from the settlers who were afraid or reluctant to shoot the natives. He then brought in a bill before his Legislative Council for the establishment of a new police force for these outlying localities. In each district of New South Wales there was to be an officer appointed with the title of commissioner ; he was to have thirty mounted troopers under his command, and with that force was to secure the settlers from depredation by apprehending offenders, but he was also to see that no atrocities were committed by the white men on the native tribes ; to hold an inquest on the body of every native who died by violence ; and to take care that native women were not kept at s House of Commons Papers, 1844."], [267, "THE TREATMENT OF THE ABORIGINALS.\u2014 1838 TO 1846. 245 the huts of shepherds. The cost of this, staff of commissioners and men was to be defrayed by a tax levied on stock, the assessment being one penny for each sheep (afterwards reduced to a half-penny), and three halfpence on every head of cattle. In 1839, when this act came into force, the only part of Victoria that was settled was the middle district south of the Murray between the Ovens and the Loddon, and stretching to the sea. This was constituted the Port Phillip district, and Henry Fysche Gisborne was appointed its commissioner at a salary of \u00a3500 a year. But ere long this district was divided, and Foster Fyans, F. A. Powlett, Peter Snodgrass, and others were appointed to smaller districts at slightly smaller salaries, and the outlying territories, as fast as they were occupied by squatters, were constituted into new districts to be administered each by a crown lands commissioner. The first duty of that functionary on reaching his district was to obtain a list of all the stations, and of all the white men connected with these stations, and with that register in his possession he was able to keep a check on the station hands even though they were somewhat removed from observation. These commissioners were not a charge upon the community generally, being paid by the assessment upon stock, and also by fees charged to the squatters whenever they took their troopers out to recover stolen sheep, or held an inquiry into outrages committed by the blacks. Unluckily in this latter way they had abundance of work to perform. For in the earlier years the deaths of white men were reported almost monthly, and the losses of sheep rendered several squatters insolvent. Amongst these was poor Mr. Waugh, who had affected the immigration to the colony a great deal by his attractive book, \" Three Years' Experience in Australia.\" But he added a fourth and dismal year to that experience. He had returned to England, published his book, and again settled in Australia, taking up a station in the Westernport district. He was a man who always showed great kindness to the blacks, and he reported afterwards that his men had invariably treated them well. John Kyly, an immigrant, and Edward Haly, an ex-convict, were his shepherd and hutkeeper, and they had been instructed to give their native visitors an occasional sheep. They were left alone for a time in May 1840. On Mr. Waugh's return he found the men gone, the hut pillaged, and on the table lay an open diary which Kyly kept from day to day. The entry for 21st May read: \u2014 \"The blacks paid us a visit to-day\u2014 were very saucy\u2014 I gave them a sheep; they did not appear satisfied\u2014 said they would pay us another visit.\" It was the last entry in that daily record. The blacks had paid them the threatened visit. The bodies of the men were never found, but the hat of one of them was picked up at a distance from the hut ; all the sheep, nearly six hundred, that had been under their charge, had been wantonly destroyed, and within a year of his settling in the district, Waugh had only 280 left of his thousand sheep. The mysterious disappearance of the bodies in these cases led to the belief that they were eaten by the blacks, and that idea deepened the feeling of horror felt by the white men on hearing of such occurrences. There may have been some truth in the belief, for when a man named Forman was murdered on a lonely station in the Portland Bay district, and the body was not to be discovered, a black who was subsequently captured, reported that though his tribe had killed and eaten forty sheep at the time, yet they had cut the murdered man's body into small pieces, and eaten it by the way, as an act of revenge no doubt. That the blacks occasionally indulged in cannibalism, when well enough supplied with food, is manifest from Protector Robinson's own account of a scene which he himself witnessed."], [268, "246 VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. When he was encamped with a tribe one night, a man from a neighbouring tribe entered the camp, crept to the mia-mia of a woman, and smashed her skull with two blows of a tomahawk. She was not immediately killed, but as the brains were protruding through two fractures her death was certain, and she never recovered consciousness. Her friends sallied forth for revenge, and succeeded in killing a woman of the neighbouring tribe. When they came back the woman of their own encampment was in her death agonies. Mr. Robinson said he could do nothing in the case, so he sat upon a prostrate tree not far off and watched. The blacks sat round the woman till she had breathed her last, then they rushed upon the body \u2014 men and women equally. They cut it open with sharp pieces of stone, and drawing forth the intestines, ate them still warm from the body. At the beginning of these revolting proceedings, Mr. Robinson judged by the frequent lamentations of the women that it was a wild and uncouth sort of mourning ; but when the liver was drawn forth, the fierce scramble that took place for its possession, and the silent ferocity with which the men lapped up the blood from the cavities of the body, showed that it could be no monstrous token of affection. The limbs were wrenched off and eaten raw, and the natives in their kindness brought Mr. Robinson a foot for his share. He did not wish to run the risk of offending them, but secretly buried it within the privacy of his tent. Cannibalism was certainly never practised to a serious extent among the blacks, but they looked on such a custom with very different feelings from those of Europeans ; and there was enough of it to affect the imaginations of the settlers, the newly arrived immigrants especially. It is not surprising, therefore, that the white population felt their demand to be one of virtuous indignation when they asked that the natives when caught should be tried and punished with the full severity of the law. In the space of only two months the Port Fairy settlers lost 3200' sheep ; there were three of their men murdered and eight desperately wounded, most of them having been left for dead with their skulls battered in. These all suffered in separate attacks, and the arrival of news from all sides of death and disasters left a very gloomy impression on the minds of the survivors. The appearance of a smart body of the new police in each district greatly mended matters ; but when they proceeded to take into custody the malefactors, when these prisoners were tried, and condemned to death for murder, the question arose what was to be done with them. The first notable case occurred in 1840, when Tallboy and Neville's Billy were convicted of the murder of white men under barbarous circumstances. Gipps refused to let them be executed till he heard from the Colonial Office, and indeed he recommended that their lives be spared ; Lord John Russell ordered that they be kept in detention, and carefully instructed, and that as soon as their education should be sufficiently advanced they should be liberated.'\" There seemed to be at that time some likelihood of the frequent appearance of natives before the courts in Melbourne, and the Government, in order to see that justice was done to them, appointed a standing counsel to defend them. Mr. Redmond Barry, then one of the two leading barristers, was chosen for that purpose, and his kindness of heart, joined to a Genuine zeal on behalf of these children of the forest, made him an excellent advocate of their cause. It must have been a spectacle worth seeing when the dignified Mr. Barry rose to move for a habeas corpus for the bodies of five natives, and in sonorous tones read to the court their high-sounding names \u2014 Cocknose, Jupiter, Roger, Bumbletoe, and Coldmorning ; or when a crowd of blinking natives filled the dock and wondered at the stately movements 10 Russell's despatch, House of Commons Papers, 1840."], [269, "THE TREATMENT OF THE ABORIGINALS.\u2014 1883 TO 1846. 247 of the law in wig and gown on all sides. Occasionally the natives were jocose, as when a stalwart rascal convulsed the court by pointing to Judge Therry on the bench and asking one of the by-standers \u2014 \" Give that fellow tickpence, make it all right.\" As a rule the blacks were discharged, on the ground that they did not understand the nature of the pleadings. Of thirteen who were arraigned for murder during the years 1841 and 1842 ten were so discharged, and three were executed. But of these three, there were two who could not be regarded as ordinary natives. They were aboriginals of Tasmania, Robert Timney and Jemmy Smallboy. The)' had been resident with Protector Robinson for eleven years, and had crossed to Victoria with his family. They were supposed to be thoroughly civilised, yet they committed a savage murder at Westernport. Accompanied by three women, also of Protector Robinson's household, Lalla Rookh Truganini, afterwards well-known as the last of the Tasmanian natives, Fanny Watcrpoordeyer, and Maria Matilda Nattepolenimma, together with another male Tasmanian, Jack Napoleon Tarraparraura, they had fallen upon two sailors near Westernport, and without provocation of an)- sort, had murdered them. It is thought that they had mistaken the white men for two others who had offended them, but the circumstances of the murder were treacherous and exasperating. Mr. Barry defended them with skill and patience, but the two prime actors were sentenced to death ; their execution took place not long after. One sulky and sullen, the other groaning and uttering heart-rending cries, they emerged from the darkness of their cells to ascend the scaffold prepared for them on the site where the Melbourne Hospital now stands ; there they expiated their deed of savagery. The third man who was executed was the principal murderer of Mr. Codd, the overseer of Mr. Wedge's station at the Grange. The Wedges were all noted for their kindness to the blacks, and they employed none but men of good character who would not be likely to injure them. But it was often not easy to satisfy the natives, and in spite of all that was done for them, a party of eighteen on one occasion approached the homestead for the purpose of plundering the store attached to it. Charles W'edge and his overseer, Mr. Codd, along with two servants, defended it resolutely, but the natives threw more than thirty spears into the place, when the white men were obliged to fire a swivel gun the)- had mounted, and frightened the natives away. Nobody, however, was hurt, and the marauders became more outrageous than before. A few days after this, Mr. Codd went over to Mr. Cox's station on a visit, and was spending the evening with his friend, Mr. Brock, the manager of that station. Some blacks came begging ; they were welcomed with kindness, received a good meal of bread and roast meat, and apparently departed. The two friends then sat down by the door of the hut to enjoy the coolness of the evening, and Mr. Brock got out his bugle to amuse himself with some music, when one or two other natives appeared, also begging. Codd left his friend still discoursing on the bugle, and procured a damper for the natives, but as he was proceeding to divide it among them, they suddenly thrust a spear into him. That was the signal for other natives concealed hard by to rush in. Codd fell pierced with ten spears ; his skull was battered in. A few of the natives turned their attention to the bugler, who had dropped his instrument and fled. He was frightfully wounded by spears, and even by clubs, ere he succeeded in breaking through the cordon of natives. He owed his safety only to his great strength and agility. But an unfortunate servant named Rooney, who was at a little distance, hearing the shouts, hurried up to render assistance. He was caught, and beaten on the head with clubs until the natives thought him dead. They then plundered the place and made off. When assistance came back along with Mr. Brock, Mr. Codd was found dead. Vol. 1. 2 G"], [270, "248 VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. and the still more unfortunate Rooney was sound alive, but with his jaw broken and his skull fractured in several places. He recovered after a long time, but never regained his reason, being an idiot for the rest of his life. Foster Fyans, the commissioner, a day or two later rode up with his troopers. The blacks who had committed the outrage were all well known by name, the leaders being Cocknose, Jupiter, Bumbletoe, and Roger, who had already been placed in the dock of the Criminal Court at Melbourne, but had escaped by the defence of Mr. Barry. A struggle took place, in which one or two of the natives were killed, and Roger was apprehended. Again Mr. Barry displayed ability and eloquence and zeal in the effort to secure his acquittal, but the evidence of Mr. Brock was conclusive. Roger was this time condemned, and suffered the last penalty of the law; the first native of Victoria that was executed after a trial in British fashion. For four years there was no other execution of a native; then in 1847 two were hanged. These were the last, and the total number of aboriginals of Victoria thus executed amounts to no more than three. These two were the murderers of Andrew Beveridge. They belonged to the natives of the Wimmera district, and they were difficult to overtake. Three of the Western port police undertook the task; they were joined by Mr. Beveridge's brother, by Mr. French and Mr. Kirby.\" But it was useless to think of pursuing the murderers out on the arid plains. The policemen disguised themselves as bushmen, and gave it out that they had come to the district in search of a run. The rumour spread, and word was passed from native to native that there were new comers in the district who were going to feed the natives liberally. A palisade was put up enclosing a small space, in the middle of which a large fire was lit, and on the fire a pot was swung, containing an enticing pudding of flour and sugar and water. The police then invited the natives to enter, but when they came up would allow only six to dine at a time, taking care to introduce the three murderers of Mr. Beveridge among the first set. Whilst they were eating, the police made a rush, and the three murderers \u2014 Bobby, Ptolemy and Bullet-eye \u2014 were thrown to the ground and secured with cords; all the other natives rushed yelling away from the place. The three captives struggled frantically for their freedom, but were carried to a neighbouring hut on Mr. Coghill's run. A general attack was to be anticipated, and a message was sent for assistance, but the settlers were so scattered that by nightfall only three others had arrived, making a total of nine white men to guard the hut and their prisoners. They stood to their arms all night, but the attack did not commence till daybreak. There was a great muster of the blacks in the scrub a mile away; but only about seventy, all picked men, advanced to the first attack. They came on stealthily, thinking they were not observed, but perceiving their error, they burst into a savage yell, and rushing forward, discharged their spears against the hut, sending some through the openings of the slabs, and wounding the sergeant of police. The white men then began to fire through the chinks in the walls, and man after man of the natives dropped upon the grass. They were very resolute, however, and climbing to the roof endeavoured to strip off the bark covering, but shot after shot took effect, and the aborigines felt themselves frustrated in their first assault. They withdrew to obtain reinforcements. There was a pause, during which the besieged white men had anxious anticipations ; so much depended upon their supplies of ammunition. But during the lull there galloped up to the scene a party of settlers who had ridden seventy-five miles to give assistance. The aborigines then lost heart and retired, while the police carried their three prisoners to Melbourne. The trial came on in due course at the Melbourne Criminal Sessions. Mr. Barry argued that as they could not M'Combie, p. 93"], [271, "THE TREATMENT OF THE ABORIGINALS.-1838 TO 1846. 249 understand the proceedings there could be no proper case against them, and he therefore moved for their discharge. But interpreters being found, the trial went forward, and resulted in the conviction of Bobby and Ptolemy ; the evidence which identified Bullet-eye as one of the murderers was inadequate, and he was discharged. On the 30th April, 1847, the two unfortunate natives were led out to the scaffold, prepared where now stands the Working Men's College. Clad in duck frocks and trousers, attended by a clergyman and one of the protectors, they stepped out of the gloomy gaol behind to meet their fate. They sobbed piteously when pinioned ; when the method of their death was exposed they shuddered visibly, but without a word submitted to their fate, and expiated with their lives the scene they had helped to enact by the banks of the distant Murray. These two murderers and the murderer of Mr. Codd were the only three whom the white men hanged out of the thirty or forty arrested for murder during these early years, and it cannot be said that the law dealt harshly or with vindictiveness against them. We might perhaps have been better pleased if no such executions had taken place, but the settlers who saw their friends and their servants murdered, yet did not dare to retaliate, were naturally indignant that the law dealt so leniently with those whom they regarded as treacherous murderers. It was a dilemma, and the authorities inclined to the side of mercy. But much greater was the dilemma when deciding what was to be done to the blacks for murders committed among themselves. Gipps had proclaimed them to be subjects of Her Majesty, and entitled to the protection of Her Majesty's laws. But it could scarcely be tolerated that Her Majesty's subjects should murder each other without hindrance. On the other hand, how could they be prevented from doing so? And if captured, how could they justly be punished when they had only followed the laws and customs of their fathers? The authorities found it wisest to interfere in no way with the blacks who still roamed as of old. They continued to exterminate each other as before. But blacks who associated with the white men, who dwelt at their stations, who took service with the squatters for a time, and then as before murdered other friendly blacks in the neighbourhood, of necessity attracted to themselves the notice of the law. It was a very hard matter to decide what was to be done with them when they appeared in the dock charged with having broken the British law while following their own. The case which formed a test was that of Bon Jon, over which a vast deal of legal discussion took place ; it was of value, however, as a precedent. Bon Jon had been adopted as a servant to Captain Foster Fyans, and a capital servant he made. Mounted on a good horse, he galloped all over the country beside his master, showing abundant courage and no little sagacity. But he belonged to a tribe from which the Colac blacks wished to secure a victim, and they hung about Fyans' house for a long time, seeking to kill him, and extract his kidney fat. He, however, eluded their pursuit. After a time he rejoined his tribe ; when happening by chance to see a Colac black with a lubra, he used the musket with which he was armed to shoot the man ; then he appropriated the woman. Fyans arrested him, to his great indignation and surprise. It never occurred to him that there could be the least objection to his shooting a man of a tribe which sought his life. However, he was mistaken; he was carried to Melbourne, and in July 1841 was put upon his trial. Mr. Barry utterly denied the competency of the court to try an offence committed by one native against another. Judge Willis, in a lengthy address, adorned with numerous quotations from Virgil, extending occasionally to ten or a dozen lines, expressed the same opinion. Barry on one side, Crokc on the other, argued and answered, and quoted cases for and against ; the matter was"], [272, "250 VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. most earnestly thrashed out, the decision eventually being that the court had no jurisdiction in such cases. Bon Jon, however, was handed over to Protector Robinson to be educated and improved. He was killed not long after at a corroboree. This case decided the point that the blacks were at liberty to follow their own customs among themselves as to murders and retaliation ; and their ferocity, reinforced by the possession of firearms, and afforded an ampler scope by the mixing up of tribes that had taken place with the advent of the white man, was a main cause of the decay of the race. There were in all six prime causes, anyone of which would probably enough have led to their extinction : the introduction of European diseases ; frequent affrays with white men ; increased facilities for the display of their own ferocity towards each other ; even more than any of these \u2014 drunkenness; the reduction of the birthrate, consequent on the immorality of the women; and, lastly, the increased practice of infanticide, the women, through some superstition, destroying almost all the half-caste infants who now made a large proportion of their offspring. The race, therefore, was doomed to destruction, and as it had never been more than barely recuper ative before, its decline was now mournfully rapid. Fifteen years after the advent of John Batman, the remnant that was left was of no material consequence in the community. Many of the settlers in those days dreamt of the possibility of training them to be useful servants. Sometimes they were very successful, and the natives showed themselves useful in man)- ways ; not that they ever were willing to do hard bodily labour, but in herding sheep, in riding messages, in driving waggons, they were often quite as valuable as the average European. But though an individual black was found thus capable, his period of usefulness was short. He was induced to rejoin his tribe, or killed by a member of some other tribe ; or he began to long for the freedom of the bush, and departed. We have very full infor mation on this subject, for in 1846, when there was a great dearth of labour, and when the protectorate system had proved itself a failure, Gipps thought of trying some scheme of converting the natives into shepherds. He accordingly sent a circular to all squatters asking their opinion. He received the stories of their various experiences in large numbers.'\" The two who arc most favourable to the experiment give their evidence first. The)- have been very sue- JEANIE FARIE, A NATIVE HELP Kmployed on Mr. Robert Hood's \" Merrang\" estate Draicn from life in 1887 by P. A.

But all the others agree in representing the scheme as being from '-Proceedings of Legislative Council of N.S.W., 1846."], [273, "THE TREATMENT OF THE ABORIGINALS.\u2014 1838 TO 1846. 251 their own personal knowledge, not capable of permanent adoption. Admiral P. P. King, who had long been manager of a large station in New South Wales, expressed the general sentiment when he said that the natives were often useful for odd work of a light kind, and that they might sometimes continue at it for months at a time, but that they could not be relied on, as employers would require their European servants to be, for any fixed time, or over any fixed period. Gipps was very much enamoured of his scheme, but the balance of evidence was decidedly against it. Yet it must be mentioned that some of the squatters did eventually train the blacks to make good shepherds. When the gold-digging fever at a later date drew' away all the white men, the natives on some of the runs were the only shepherds for a year together. But the squatters looked upon such a course as somewhat risky, and none of them could make it a permanent practice. Even native children who were adopted very young rarely made good servants. A few here and there were remarkable exceptions, and became smart and useful ; but that was not the c tsc with the majority. In short, there was no niche in the social fabric of the white man that the native was capable of permanently occupying. By far the most promising attempt to utilise them was the formation of a corps of native police. In 1836 that experiment had first been made; the blacks had been enrolled and found of some little use, but the protectors were opposed to the attempt, and on their arrival the corps was disbanded. In 1842, however, the zeal and energy of Mr. Pultency Dana made a second effort much more effectual. Twenty-five of the Westernport natives were enrolled, and a camp formed near Melbourne. A simple but efficient drill was invented for them, and they soon made a smart troop. They were utilised not only in suppressing the outrages of their fellow-country men, but also in the capture of white bushrangers. They were engaged in several conflicts and displayed courage and coolness. But it is difficult to decide how far their character was satisfactory. Those who saw them dash up in military style to a homestead that had been molested, and ask if the \" blacks\" had been troublesome ; those who saw their smart evolutions, their adroit pursuits, their patience and obedience, were charmed by the prospect that seemed to offer of engaging them cheerfully in a kind of service and a manner of life that was sure to be to their liking. But those who had long and intimate experience of them gave no very cxalted description of their private character. Protector Thomas says in his report for 1 843 that they arc as bad as the rest of the natives ; they rob, and drink, and fight among themselves ; and certainly the record of their careers bears out that description Six of them died of drunkenness ; two were killed while drunk ; nine of them, after deserting their corps, threw off their clothes and roamed the forest till they died or were killed. Only eight of the twenty-five are recorded to have been faithful till their deaths, and to have led quiet and respectable lives. Steadily and surely the dark tribes died out, till the census of 1861 showed only 1694 of them left alive, a diminution of a thousand in the ten years since the previous census. But at this point there began to be visible a slightly brighter prospect. In the first place, what English missionaries had failed to do, Germans seemed likely to accomplish. The Moravians in Europe, hearing the tale of aboriginal degradation and extinction, and moved no doubt by the correspondence of Latrobe, who was of their own persuasion, had started a small mission under Mr. Hagenauer and Mr. Spieseke at the junction of the Loddon and Murray in 185 1. Like other attempts of the kind it showed little hope of fruitfulness, till about 1858, when the Rev. F. A. Hagenauer, after a few years of experience, proved himself to be the first man equipped with all the qualifications necessary for the work. He formed the station"], [274, "252 VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. of Ramahyuck, in Gippsland, at the head of Lake Wellington, fifteen miles from Sale. W7ith unobtrusive beneficence he laboured for years unknown to the public, not dismayed by failures, not disgusted by ingratitude. Other Moravians joined in the work. Mr. C. W. Kramer, Mr. J. H. Stahle, and Mr. Hartmann, all showed a peculiar aptitude for dealing with a most difficult problem, and it is creditable to the Christian churches of Victoria that as soon as they recognised this fact, as soon as they were satisfied that these men, though missionaries of an- other denomination, were yet the most qualified for the work, so soon did they step forward with their voluntary assistance. The Presbyterian Church offered funds for the station at Ramahyuck, and for twenty years and more sup- plied three-fourths of the money required for its maintenance, while the Government gave the balance, the missionaries looking for their small stipends from their own brethren in Germany. The Church of England likewise supported one at Lake Condah, while the Moravians from their own funds maintained Mr. Hartmann, and afterwards Mr. Kramer, in what they called the \" Ebenczer \" sta- tion, at Lake Hindmarsh. A fourth mission station, supported by the Church of England, was eventually equally successful under the Rev. John Bulmer, in Gipps- land, at Lake Tyers, about five miles beyond the Lakes Entrance. It is to be remembered, however, that the numbers dealt with on these stations were small, each of the sour containing only from sixty to ninety natives, of whom two-thirds were generally children ; so that the experiment, though captain dana's native troopers. the total number thus provided for never exceeded 350, successful, was not successful on a large scale. In 1860 the office of Protector of Aborigines was abolished, and in its place was appointed a Board for the Protection of the Aborigines.

For some years this Board worked quietly and steadily, and under its auspices there rose two new stations \u2014 that of Framlingham, near Belfast, and that of Coranderrk, near Lilydale ; while the four missionary stations were assisted with funds, with stores, stock, fruit-trees, and so forth from a Government grant of about seven thousand pounds allowed each year for the use of the natives, and administered by the Board, while reserves of land were made round the stations amounting in all to 22,000 acres. So great an improvement was effected by its efforts that in 1869 it was resolved to give it by legislative enactment a greatly increased extent of power. As a supple mentary feature there were appointed forty-nine local guardians, gentlemen who undertook the honorary duty of keeping a kindly eye on the blacks of the neighbourhood, so as to discounten ance their indulgence in drink ; to secure the conviction of publicans who broke the law by providing them with it ; and to distribute blankets and occasional provisions to such of the natives as refused to live at the stations, but were in tem porary distress. :EV. F. A. HAGENAl'ER. From that time onward, though the natives continued to decrease, yet their diminution became slower. For a long time they came but little before the public eye. They now no longer entered into conflict with the whites, and according to the testimony of Mr. Hagenauer, their tribal feuds had died out ; many of the tribes were reduced to but a few men ; all of them were only the skeletons of what they once were, and the)' submitted to a general fusion, and lived in friendly fashion. Once a year a report was sent in from each station to the Board, which in its turn reported to Parliament. The record was one of slow and steady progress. For a time hopes were stimulated that were not destined to fulfilment. In 1871 the Board expressed its certainty that the race would be improved and perpetuated, so many of them had been converted from houseless wanderers smitten with disease, and degraded by drink, into families of diligent people, living in houses, owning property, and sending their children regularly to school. But these results were true of only half the aborigines ; there were always five or six hundred not under the control of the Board ; some of these were employed as stockriders. some as shearers, some as domestic servants. A certain proportion of these lived honest and decent lives, but certainly not the larger proportion; in the year already quoted, 1871, no less than 181 of them spent a portion of their time in one or other of Her Majesty's gaols, and even those who lived at the stations often took a fit of roving, and only returned after having passed through a time of trouble, frequently including a visit to the lock-up. In 1877 a Royal Commission was appointed \"to inquire into the present condition of the aborigines of the colony, and advise as to the best means of caring for and dealing with them in the future.\" They reported that the total number of blacks so far as they could discover amounted to 1067, of whom 527 were dwellers at the six stations, while 540 were wanderers. The former arc said to heave made most satisfactory progress in civilisation. \" They dwell in houses ; are decently and suitably clad ; live with their families around them ; polygamy is not known ; and marriage is respected. They follow the employments of civilised people with some"], [276, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 254 regularity ; the vices of drunkenness and prostitution, though not unknown, are exceptional ; while the young receive a sound education in the schools attached to the stations.\" The Ramahyuck station is placed in this report at the head of the six, and Mr. Hagenauer's labours are recognised with praise. There the visitors found thirteen neat cottages, a church, a pleasant school-house, with large dormitories for the accommodation of the children. These buildings formed three sides of a quadrangle, with a neat garden, with orchards and trim fences, all imparting to the eye a grateful sense of tidiness and comfort. The men worked in the hop plantations, and what with stock and a little farming, made the place in part self-supporting. The children formed a school which, under the enthusiastic labours of Mr. Kramer and his successors, took a prominent place in the list of those under the care of the Education Department. Inspector after inspector \u2014 Mr. Brodribb, Mr. Topp, Mr. Elkington \u2014 express the pleasure of seeing the black children so smart, so obedient, so intelligent. Up to the third-class standard their proficiency is reported to be excellent, and Mr. Brodribb gives expression to the delight he felt when a class of these little native voices sang some part songs, harmonized for two or three parts, in correct time and with a sweet intonation. The aboriginals on this station had even reached an unexpected phase of civilisation, the worthy missionary deprecating their excessive fondness for \" yellow-back novels \" from town. At Lake Condah the missionary had neat cottages and tidy gardens kept in order by the natives ; a good school and smart scholars, partly taught by two native teachers. At Lake Hindmarsh the Moravians had pleasant looking buildings of stone, gardens, ample orchards, all reported to be clean and cheerful, and inhabited by respectable and comfortable-looking people. At Lake Tyers the six cottages, the dormitories for children, .school-rooms and stores, were all attractive, and filled with cheerful parents and intelligent scholars. But the commission found the mission stations much more to be commended than those of Framlingham and Coranderrk, which were directly under government control. Yet even there the progress of the natives was noticeable. In these later years it has doubtless been easier, much easier, to secure success. The more vicious, the more quarrelsome, the more ferocious, those more easily enslaved by drink, were mostly gone. The tribal laws, with their strong influences adverse to mission efforts, were gone, and the remnants of the tribes made a comparatively inert mass that offered no active opposition. The white men held the country beyond hope of remedy, and the black man could no longer rob; nor yet could he secure his living apart from the white folks and without dependence on them. The spirit of the race was broken, and they at length accepted what the conquering race in all kindness offered. But at best the stations contained only half of the natives. The five hundred and forty who held aloof, and worked for their own living in their own way, are described by the commission as being mostly of a low description, the majority given to drink ; they earn good wages, but imitate the white shepherds in their periodic carnival, when a week of orgy destroys the labour of a year. Exposure after their drunken frolics, and the diseases incident to dissipated habits, carried off these unattached aboriginals, and even on the stations the deaths were more numerous than the births. So, in both cases, the natives declined till the census of 1881 showed no more than seven hundred and eighty, even including a laro*e proportion of half-castes.\" In 1885, almost all that were left were resident in the six stations; they numbered five hundred and ninety-four, and there were in all probability not so many as Hayter's Year Book 1887, p. 40."], [277, "THE TREATMENT OF THE ABORIGINALS.-1838 TO 1846. 255 two hundred more in the colony. They now are of no moment in a population numbering a million, and though the board for the protection of the aborigines still does excellent work, there seems to be no means devisable for arresting their diminution. Their disappearance is doomed ; but a careful retrospect of our colonial history does not suggest that the white men were the active means of their destruction, though the white man's drink and the white man's advantages in fight may have had a great deal to do with it. On the contrary, the community showed every solicitude to conserve their lives and secure their happiness. It made many mistakes in the details of its well-meant but sometimes ill-advised efforts for their good, but on the whole, it may be said with confidence that there exists no reason for remorse, though there may be for regret, in regard to the dealings of the colonists of Victoria with their native predecessors. Note. \u2014 The engraving placed at the head of the foregoing chapter (for the original of which we are indebted to Mrs. Anne F. Bon, of Wappan station) represents the portraits of sixteen aboriginals who went down from Coranderrk to Melbourne to bid farewell to the Hon. (now Sir) Graham Berry, on the eve of his departure for England to act in the capacity of Agent-General for Victoria. There is some pathos about this group of finely-made and intelligent-looking men, many of whom stand forth as the sole survi vors of a rapidly vanishing race \u2014 formerly the lords of fair Australia. The central figure of the picture is that of Barrack, the King of the Yarra Yarra Tribe, and its sole survivor, who, according to our informant, is held in high esteem by those amongst whom he lives, and no less by the whites who know him. He is said to have great influ ence over the people at the mission, and to use it only for their good, the old man being tion alluded to above presented Mr. Berry with a native-made basket filled with flowers, weapons of various kinds (including boomer angs, &c), and a handsome blue velvet and silver mounted album, and with it was the following letter, dictated solely, and without assistance, by the chief: \u2014 \"We have come to see you because you have done a great deal of work for the aborigine.

As his recollections date back to the time of Batman's visit to Port Phillip (when the old man believes he himself must have been about eleven years of age), a conversation with him is very interesting, as, though he speaks English slowly, the grammar used is good, and the wording most expressive.

(Signed) Barrack, Chief of the Yarra Yarra Tribe of Aboriginals, Victoria, Australia.' On the left of Barrack, with his hand resting on the shoulder of the old chief, stands Bertdrack, or \" Punch,\" by which name he is more familiarly known. He is the only son of old King Michie, chief of the Broken River tribe. He was born near where the town of Benalla now stands, that being a portion of his father's territory. When a little boy he went to Wappan, and remained in the employ of the late Mr. John Bon for many years. When Coranderrk was formed, he went there, married, and settled down. He is about forty-seven years of age, a powerfully built man, enormously stout, and a good workman. He possesses intellect of no mean Older ; is exceedingly shrew d and honourable in business transactions. He has had a large family, all of whom are dead with the exception of one daughter. In August 188; he lost a son aged seven teen years of phthisis, and ten days later a younger daughter died of the same disease. In January following, Eliza, the poor mother, Miccumbed to her sorrow, and followed her children to the grave. She was a member of the Presbyterian Church, and a true Christian. Bertdrack has had many trial-. and has on several occasions been subjected to what was considered by himself and his countrymen harsh treatment at the hands of his protectors. On such occasions he appealed to the Hon.

It was thi remembrance of these acts of kindness which prompted this deputation ol aborigines to wait upon Sir Graham, offer their presents, and wish him God. speed on his departure for England.

They spread the first thin stratum of civilisation over the face of the '^rff) <fi)l| land. They came with hopes and buoyant expectations, and every vessel that vr^^K landed its bleating cargo on our shores brought men in whose eyes a dream of fl fortune shone like a guiding star to carry them forward into the future. Some of them, but only some, acquired the wealth they dreamt of. Those who crossed the valley of the troublous days that filled the years from 1842 to 1845 \u2014 those who saw the better times, and gently ascended the green slopes that led upward to comfort and competency throughout 1846 and the following years \u2014 found Victoria to be indeed the land of promise, the squatter's paradise they had thought it ; but how many hundreds went down into that valley of commercial depression never to come up again. There were many causes that led to the disasters of these gloomy years. So cruelly had the droughts of 1839 and 1840 told on the flocks of Australia that owners were loth to buy fresh stock which they were so likely to lose ; and, indeed, most of them were anxious to sell a portion of what they had. Down went the values of sheep and cattle therefore, falling steadily month by month ; down, till the anxious squatters thought they had reached the lowest limit ; down again, and yet further down, till sheep that in 1838 had cost two pounds a-piece were not to be sold at five shillings. A pause gave brighter hopes ; but again a downward turn, until half-a-crown a sheep was the average price of flocks when they changed their owners. Many a fine station was sold for eighteen-pence a sheep, and a few desperate cases were known in which the sum realised was no more than sixpence each. The million and a-half of sheep which the colony contained were therefore depreciated in value at least two millions of pounds, and a similar decline in the value of cattle also contributed to the severity of the blow received by the pastoral interests of the colony. And when a depreciation of stock to the extent of nearly three millions"], [279, "THE SQUATTING ERA.\u2014 1846 TO 1851. 257 of money was distributed over a total of about six hundred stockholders, it gave an average loss oi ieSooo to each, a sum quite sufficient to absorb all the capital of the majority. Hence those who were not possessed of resources beyond the money invested in stock found it impossible to carry on. Those who had borrowed from banks or Sydney firms an advance of, say, five hundred pounds, on the security of two thousand they had themselves invested in stock, found their own cap.tal gone and the bank's almost vanished likewise. The stock, when sold failed to realise the amount advanced; the banks themselves grew tottering; one of the most respectable of them became insolvent, and so increased the monetary confusion. Added to this remarkable depreciation of stock there was the reaction which followed a period of excited speculation. That firm belief in the future greatness of Melbourne and Adelaide which possessed the colonists of 1837 and 1838 has been fully, and far more than fully, justified by the development of their history ; but at the time it led to a form of madness, and produced an absurd inflation of prices. Where every one wanted to secure allotments in towns that were to become so prosperous, the immediate effect of competition was to raise the prices beyond anything that a prudent man was likely to regard as continuous in the immediate future. A lull in the sale, the necessities of stock-owners forced to sell their land in order to hold their flocks, brought about one of those periods when buyers pause to see the course which events are about to take ; and in these times of speculation, when once the charm is broken, when once the electric circuit is disjointed by ever so little, when once the public begins to think, instead of following the lead one of another, and the constant succession of sales and re-sales that has gone forward so merrily becomes suspended for just a month, then comes the turn of the tide ; a little depreciation in value follows the pause ; it frightens the holders of land ; they wake from their AInaschar-like dreams ; they then are anxious to sell, and no one is anxious to buy just at that time ; the timid force a sale at a heavy loss rather than run the risk of further depreciation ; and speculators are like a row of dominoes set up on end: tip over a few at one end and down they all go. Thus, in two years, Melbourne witnessed a surprising reduction of prices. Much of its property had declined to one-tenth of its former value. No doubt all the land in the country, every acre of it, was still worth all that had been paid for it at the Government auctions. But that land had been sold and re-sold by many a speculator, and at each transaction the price had gone up with bounds. If a man bought a piece of land for five hundred pounds and sold it for five thousand ; if he carried off his profits and, like a prudent man, invested them elsewhere ; if the land then fell back to its value of five hundred pounds, the community was certainly poorer to the extent of four thousand five hundred pounds. And so the colonists of Victoria, at a time when all their capital was wanted in the initiation of new enterprises, found that capital largely carried away by the results of their own fervid speculation. After 1842, affairs began to mend. A season or two of well-timed rains made the stations in New South Wales look green again, and so long as a sheep's fleece was worth half-a-crown a year, if the squatter saw a prospect of keeping it alive, he was not likely to sell it at the prices then ruling. There was therefore at once a steady improvement in prices, and though they never again rose to anything like their previous amount, they at once set the squatting interest on a firmer footing. Nay, more than that, though the cases of individual hardship were many and great, the crisis had left a healthier tone, as the thunderstorm leaves a fresher atmosphere. The weak, the extravagant, the idle among the squatters were weeded out; those who avoided borrowing, who by careful or even by penurious living, scraped together all the capital they could gather"], [280, "258 VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. and bought up the flocks of their less prudent neighbours, were placed on the high road to fortune. A thousand pounds at the depth of the crisis could easily secure ten thousand sheep, from which the net profits, not ten years later, would certainly exceed ten thousand pounds per annum. Hence the foundation of many of those magnificent fortunes that have made the names of some of these cautious pioneers well-known throughout the colony. Strange to say, a very simple expedient, and one that to us appears very evident, had a great influence in improving the price of stock. At the time when sheep were selling by tens of thousands at two shillings a-piece, it occurred to a squatter of Yass, named O'Brien, that the mere tallow which the sheep could supply if boiled down must be worth at least six shillings in the London market, and that the skin and fleece ought to make a total value of at least eight shillings. Why, therefore, was it that stockowners could not realise five for them? It was not long before the timid creatures whose lives were of so little value were converted into barrels of tallow for export, and many a shaky station grew firm again by imitation. So frequent became the operation of boiling down that establishments were built for the purpose of carrying out the process more quickly and efficacious!}' than the appliances of the stations would permit. Thither are driven the ewes past bearing; a living crowd with anxious eyes, yet regarded only as worthless refuse ; they are slaughtered, skinned, cut into pieces, thrown into a great wooden boiler clamped with iron. Steam is admitted by a pipe, and its boiling breath licks around the mutton joints for some hours, till the tallow is ready to be run off by a pipe below. This tallow is refined by a similar process in a smaller boiler of iron, and the whitened mass is ready for export; the wool, the skins, the bones, being meanwhile prepared likewise for sale in London. The proprietors of these establishments charged one shilling a-picce for each sheep so treated, but there was a balance of at least six shillings, and generally more, to the credit of the squatter who thus disposed of the sheep his station was unable to support. That price there fore became the inferior limit of the value of sheep. ' This process could always be resorted to, and sheep need never be sold for less. As for cattle, there grew up a trade in salt-meat for the use of ships frequenting Australian ports; and a thriving export began of horses to the Indian market. While horses were worth \u00a360 each in Calcutta, and they could easily be reared in Victoria for ,\u00a315 of a quality to suit that market, there was an excellent margin to pay for transport, for risks, and losses, and yet to leave a capital profit. So the squatter's life became in many ways a less anxious one than it had been. He had still, however, a serious trouble to worry him, and that was the unstable nature of his tenure. He held his land only from year to year. When the twelve months came to an end he paid another rent of \u00a310 for a license, and had the land at his disposal for another year. Until 1839 it had been possible for him to buy it if he pleased at the rate of 5s. an acre, but in 1842, on account of the agitations of Wakefield and the South Australian Association, the price was raised to a minimum of 12s. an acre, a price at which very little pastoral land could then be bought with any immediate prospect of profit. Yet in the following year, 1843, the upset price was again increased ; all lands sold were to be put up to auction, but the State would take nothing less than \u00a31 per acre. The squatters could not dream of buying at that price, but it was hard for them to work upon stations which might be withdrawn from them without notice. The pioneer took all the risks, endured all the discomforts of opening the wilderness for settlement. He toiled hard to place his cottage perhaps, and his garden, and his little orchard in good order ; he fenced in a stockyard or two ; he \"Present State and Prospects of Port Philiip,\" by Charles Griffith, M.A., 1845."], [281, "THE SQUATTING ERA. -1846 TO 1S31. 259 made folds and cleared scrub, and for some years effected steady improvements on all hands. Some fine morning when he rode in to see the Crown Lands Commissioners, and pay for his license, he was told it was not to be renewed. The land was wanted for a reserve, or it was to be put up for sale. He had no redress ; he must gather together his flocks, and move out to some other spot, now no easy matter when the country was becoming well occupied. What he could carry he might take away, but the bulk of his improvements must be left behind him. Most of the squatters were therefore disinclined to lay out money on the formation of comfortable homes, and the rude bark hut in these early years was considered good enough so long as there was no reasonable fixity of tenure. But, on the other hand, the squatters were many of them utterly unreasonable in the position they assumed. Some of them talked as if in equity they ought to be the owners of the land. They had gone out into the wilderness, and converted to useful purposes those wastes that never before had been turned to profit. Whose, therefore, should that land be but theirs who made it of value? The Government heard of these ideas with alarm, and justly resented the supposition that men could thus appropriate for ever little kingdoms of fertile lands to the exclusion of everybody else\u2014 that a thousand squatters could complacently map out the whole of an immensely valuable province, and absorb it to their own peculiar use. The payment of a ten pound fee for an annual license was nothing to the purpose. It merely covered the expense of registration. In short, the Government regarded the sale of these lands as being the only reasonable way of disposing of them. If the squatters were willing to go out beyond the limits of the purchased land, and accept of a temporary occupation till there should appear occupants prepared to buy, they were welcome to the use of it, and their ten pounds yearly would supply the means of securing law and order and systematic dealing so long as they were indulged with the gratuitous use of the land. That they could not put up substantial dwellings was of course uncomfortable, but it was a drawback inseparable from the position of men who, though at liberty to buy the land if they liked, chose to occupy it without buying it, as a matter of favour and only till it should be otherwise needed. Thus it is evident that there was a great deal to be said upon both sides. And it was most certainly said. The wordy combat waxed long and warm ; and of something like thirty books or pamphlets published in those days to deal wholly or in part with this \" squatting question,\" not one discusses the matter in a fair or temperate spirit. Those who wish to preserve the public domain for future occupation by industrious millions condemn the squatters as selfish, miserable monopolists. The squatters, on the other hand, and their advocates, refer to Governor Gipps as a Nero, an autocrat, a tyrant, a servile instrument of a truculent ministry ; and so on both sides the eloquence of invective was freely employed. But Gipps, in April 1844, caused it to be very clearly seen that he was master of the situation. Many of the squatters were now possessed of great flocks ; they had rolled into one station twenty, forty, sixty thousand sheep \u2014 the stock which their unfortunate neighbours had been forced to sell for a trifle. These squatters, however, did not pay ten pounds a-year for each of the runs they absorbed ; they took out a single license for the whole, so that one man for ten pounds a-year was occupying two hundred square miles, and might proceed to the occupation of a thousand for the same sum. Gipps issued new regulations. No single depasturing license would in future be available for more than twenty square miles, or, if the land were poor, for more than would support 4000 sheep. If any squatter wished to hold more he should pay an additional sum of two pounds ten shillings annually for each area that could support a thousand"], [282, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS .- PAST AND PRESENT. 260 sheep. This was done by Gipps on his own authority, and it produced an extreme ferment among the more impulsive of the squatters, who described it as an act intolerable to the inhabitants of a free country. The Legislative Council, in the following month, appointed a select committee to inquire into the grievances of Crown Land tenants. It acquiesced in the justice of Gipps's new arrangement, which was surely evident enough ; but it advocated the reduction of the minimum price for land from one pound to five shillings per acre. It also urged that the squatters should be allowed long leases, and compensation for their improvements if the land were sold to new comers. These recommendations were eventually adopted by the Colonial Office in London ; but ere that could be, three years had to slip away in correspondence, debates in Parliament, and deliberations in the British Cabinet. The fiery squatters, however, were not the people to sit tamely by while the struggle was proceeding. They had something to say for themselves. An advertisement in May 1844 called upon all the squatters of Australia Felix to \"meet on horseback upon Batman's Hill. From the Murray to the sea beach, from the Snowy Mountains to the Glenelg, let no squatter be absent.\" On the 4th of June they met, and formed a procession headed by Captain Harrison. Down the slope of Bourke-street they rode, round Swanston-street, and up the opposite incline to the Mechanics' Institute. The hall of that building, however, could not hold the numbers that appeared, and the meeting was formed on the grassy slope of Collins-street, opposite the present site of the Argus office, the squatters tying their horses to the paddock fences. Mr. A. F. Mollison was chairman. He stationed himself behind the low parapet that then stood in front of the Mechanics' Institute, and thither came the pioneers of the colony to give to their woes the forcible utterance of burning words and descending fists. Captain Hepburn and John Aitken, Major Firebracc, Charles M'Knight, and John M'Credie, Dr. Kilgour, Captain Webster, Captain Harrison, James S. Johnstone and others, declaimed against the squatting regulations in general, and more particularly against the recent innovations made by Gipps. But the tone and feeling of the meeting was sensible and moderate, and the leading resolution which was passed was to the effect that \" the most simple remedy for the injury arising from the unsettled tenure of stations would be an equitable system of leases, with promise of compensation for improvements made by occupants if the State thought proper to resume.\" This resolution was in every way reasonable. The only pity of it was that at this meeting the Governor was roundly abused, though there was at that very time a letter of his, written in the preceding April, on its way to England advising the Colonial Office to adopt measures for the relief of their grievances. He proposed that any squatter who had been five years in occupation of a station should have the right of purchasing at a minimum of .\u00a31 per acre an area of not less than 320 acres, so that he could secure his homestead and its immediate vicinity, and that if he did so he should then have a lease of the whole station for eight years Latrobe, however, was adverse to any policy which would grant extensive leases ; for, said he, a large part of the land in question is fertile and well suited for agriculture, and if people continue to arrive in the colony as they have done of late a very large portion of this very land will soon be desired for purchase, and it will then be locked in the occupation of people who, even under the recent regulations, pay no more than a halfpenny an acre of rent for the purpose of depasturing sheep. Lord Stanley adopted Gipps's view, and in January 1845 approved of the new regulations as to the charging of separate license fees for separate runs. The Governor had made the"], [283, "THE SQUATTING ERA.\u2014 1846 TO 1S31. 261 necessity for such a change very clear when he showed that many squatters held as much as two hundred thousand acres each for the payment of ten pounds per annum. But as to the recommendation with reference to sales of homesteads and leases, though in the main he agreed with them, an Act of Parliament would be necessary. Such a bill was prepared by the Colonial Office, and read a first time in July 1845, but some opposition was offered, and when the session ended on 9th August the bill had not gone beyond the second reading. In the next year Lord Stanley lost his seat in the Cabinet ; Sir Robert Peel (his chief) had suddenly gone over to the popular party on the question of the Abolition of Corn Laws, and Stanley had resigned rather than support him. His place was taken by Mr. Gladstone, who, however, held office for only a short time ; for the enemies of Peel, though of widely different views on every subject, and utterly inconsistent in all their aims, had yet united for revenge, and, forming a league on the occasion of a bill for the coercion of Ireland, had expelled the Government from office. Then came new men with new views. The Premier was Lord John Russell, who, with some years of experience as Colonial Minister, could himself take an intelligent part in the direction of affairs ; but the management of the colonies was in the hands of Earl Grey, who decided in favour of long leases for the squatters. Almost immediately after his accession to office he carried through Parliament his Waste Lands Bill, in which the main provision was the granting of leases to the squatters for a period not exceeding fourteen years. To a certain extent the inconveniences which Latrobe had foreseen were avoided. For it was directed that the Oueen-in-Council should have power to make and establish from time to time such regulations as might be deemed requisite in regard to the duration and conditions of these leases. The squatters read the provisions of the bill with a satisfaction that was largely modified by anxiety as to what the Queen and her councillors might do. In these troublous times of the most violent party politics, the Queen did not at once give her attention to the uneasy situation of the colonists, and six months rolled by while the squatters waited with anxiety for the new regulations on which their prospects so much depended. It was an eventful epoch, therefore, that wintry morning at the beginning of 1847 when the Privy Council met in Her Majesty's house at Osborne, in the Isle of Wight Prince Albert was present, and Lord Palmerston and half-a-dozen of the great lords of the Court. There, on the 9th of March, the Royal assent was given to regulations which thenceforth were to be the law of the colonies regarding the disposal of land \u2014 regulations which have been widely criticised, and which have provoked in Victoria the most animated discussions in subsequent years. These regulations, well-known, and often referred to as the Ordcrs-in-Council of 1847, gave a substantial, yet by no means unqualified, victory to the squatters. They directed that New South Wales should be divided into three classes of land ; first, the settled districts, wherein the Crown land that was yet unalienated should be open for occupation by squatters on the same terms as formerly ; second, the intermediate districts \u2014 those as yet thinly inhabited, but likely in the course of a few years to be in demand for purchase. In these districts leases were to be granted for eight years, but on the understanding that if the land were wanted for sale it could be resumed at the end of any year on the condition that a notice to that effect should be given sixty days in advance. However, these two areas were inconsiderable compared with the third class of lands \u2014 the unsettled districts \u2014 with which the squatters were mainly concerned. There the leases were to be for fourteen years, and during the currency of the lease the land was not saleable to anyone but the occupant, who was at liberty at any time to purchase any quantity he pleased, if not less than 160 acres, at \u00a31 per acre. In all three districts the"], [284, "262 VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. rent charged was to be \u00a3\\o for such an extent as would support 4000 sheep, and \u00a32 10s. for every additional thousand. These provisions satisfied all but an indiscreet few of the squatters* \u2014 men who had formed the absurd notion that occupation of the land gave them an equitable right to the possession of it in perpetuity. The measure was, under the circumstances, a wise one ; no one could have foreseen how soon it was to be a source of disadvantage ; no one dreamt of that vast influx which was to commence only four years later, and precipitate the demand for land so suddenly that the presence of men with leases still good for ten or twelve or fourteen years seemed an intolerable barrier to progress. The squatters, however, were then in possession ; nothing but the grossest breach of faith could expel them ; but when ten thousand men were clamorous to enter upon these very lands as husbandmen, we can understand the fierceness of their cry \"to unlock the lands.\" And yet, but for the unseen circumstance of the gold excitement, this \" Order-in-Council\" would have been a wise solution of ever)' difficulty, for the succeeding twenty years at all events, whilst the \" intermediate district \" would have satisfied all the requirements of immigration if only it had continued at its former rate. The squatters were satisfied, but they never did justice to Sir George Gipps. They considered him to have been an enemy, working by underhand means against their interests. It is true that Gipps was less suited for popularity than most of his predecessors had been. They had been of a somewhat paternal description, with little about them that could be described as officialism. Gipps was the first of the new race who aimed at something like statesmanship, and cultivated a formal rather than a genial sort of intercourse with his people. He was by no means perfection as a Governor, but he was far from being the tyrant, the enemy of British liberty, that some of the squatters in their fervid denunciations declared him to be. Unfortunately, failing health, warnings of a heart in dangerous condition, forced him to leave his office and all its injurious cares and excitements before the settlement of this question was arrived at. Death-stricken, though he did not know it, he bade farewell to hostile factions in Sydney, praying that God would dispose the thoughts of the colonists to a favourable recollection of himself and his wife, who had laboured with unceasing sincerity for their advancement. While Earl Grey's Act was passing the House of Commons, Sir George Gipps, whose advice was eagerly expected in England, was being tossed in a long, wear}', protracted voyage. He landed at length in London and was appointed to a position in his old corps, the Royal Engineers. While the Oucen-in-Council was passing those orders that were to give peace to the squatters in Australia, Gipps was down at Canterbury enjoying a holiday in the scenes of his boyhood, prior to his entrance on his new duties. There, at the close of a cheerful da)', his heart gave its last flutter, and there his remains were interred beneath the fretted arches of the stately cathedral.\" Four months after the meeting of the Queen's Council at Osborne House the long expected order arrived, and from that period the squatters of Victoria dated their era of sunshine, their golden days of prosperity. Sheep were steadily rising in value, and though they never reached the prices of the carl}- days, yet their prodigious increase was far more than an equivalent ; while the price of wool increased and the London market became stead)- and appreciative. Fixity of tenure and the purchase of a homestead encouraged the formation of comfortable homes ; not the palaces, perhaps, of later years, but dwellings suitable for the - Rusden's \" History of Australia,\" vol. II,, p. 370."], [285, "THE SQUATTING ERA.\u2014 r 846 TO 1851. 263 housing of culture and elegance. The tumble-down edifice of bark and poles, surrounded by trailing clouds of dust from the sheep-trampled yards, had been for the last year or two the prevailing type of squatters' homes. These were, doubtless, now more comfortable within than they had once been. The walls were lined with canvas, and hung with book-shelves \u25a0 a few cheap pictures ; glass windows ; a verandah, perhaps, kept green with creepers ; a few chairs a polished table, and probably a sofa, made the interior look more home-like than the rough slab walls that had contained no decoration but guns, shot-belts, and riding whips. But with fixity of tenure, good seasons, increasing flocks, steady wool markets, the squatter found himself in a position to hand over his old residence to his men. He chose a comely spot, and on it reared his spacious cottage, possibly of brick or stone, but more generally of weatherboard, with broad STOCKRIDER ROUNDING CATTLE. verandahs, round whose posts the vine and the passion flower twined to keep the dwelling cool. From this broad promenade a step or two led down to a flower garden, wherein were cultivated the flowers which recalled the play-grounds of early days in the motherland. William Howitt mentions those he saw most abundantly in his \"Two Years in Victoria;\" roses, snapdragons, and larkspurs ; and pansies, stocks, and lilacs. Or the lady of the house, a bride from England, watched with wonder the geraniums and pelargoniums, little dwarf things in pots in the old country, grow into great shrubs and make the garden glow with colour. The borders of thyme, and box, and sage, and rosemary, were not forgotten, and plants which the settlers had seen only as high-priced curiosities in the old world, bloomed in fresh luxuriance. The arum lily and the brilliant cactus ; the pomegranate, the oleander, and the tobacco plant, derived from the gardens Vol. I. 2 1"], [286, "264 VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. of Sydney, excited the wonder of the new-comer who saw them flourishing in the open air. Behind the house the fig, the apple, the plum, the quince, and a dozen other fruits were to be found, and in half-a-dozen years there was left scarce a squatter's house out of a thousand and more that was not, to some extent, a landmark of neatness and garden-glow to the traveller when he grew weary of the long monotonous bush road through the sombre-tinted gum trees. But though the squatters now began to be comfortable and prosperous, they had still their troubles. The blacks no longer gave them anxiety ; shepherds were not murdered ; sheep were not mangled. But the squatter had to fight against the scab, the footrot, and the dreaded catarrh. He had the dingo pest and the kangaroo trouble to worry him, and the bush fire was an evil of unknown magnitude. The most pressing of his troubles was the scab. It was a time of ill-omen when the word was passed that the epidemic had appeared among his flocks. How far it would spread, how many he would lose, he scarce could say ; but the extermination of his stock could be averted only by laborious days and watchful solicitude. His sheep would be forbidden by law to travel except in the month of February, so that he might keep his trouble to himself and not pass it onwards to his neighbours; and the law was strictly observed. There were several prosecutions, and heavy fines were imposed on squatters who moved their sheep when diseased, contrary to regulations. If he wished to sell, or desired to send a part of his flock to the boiling down establishment, he must do it in February or not at all ; and in that month everyone was on the alert to see that his flocks were not brought into contact with the travelling contagion. When the scab had fairly entered a squatter's flocks he must engage new hands, run the sheep in much smaller numbers, and provide for frequent dressings. When the sheep were shorn their heads were fastened in a bail, then the shepherds had to examine the body of each, carefully watching for the scab, and cutting the outside of it away with a pocket knife. Meantime two tubs of tobacco juice were being kept warm ; the sheep was plunged into the first tub and kept there for four or five minutes ; then listed into the second, where it was rubbed with hoop-iron to take away the remains of the scab. After that process the sheep was allowed to go, and if it did not die of the cure, it probably had no return of the scab. But one sheep, imperfectly treated, would spread the old contagion again, and the toil, the expense, the worry of it all would have to be borne over again a year later. Some men never got their flocks really clear of this epidemic. In spite of periodic examinations, some unfortunate sheep would spread among its fellows the disastrous contagion ; or some sheep escaped from a neighbouring station, would start it over again ; or possibly one overlooked on the squatter's own station by a careless shepherd, would cause the same process to be necessary year after year, till the squatter could reckon up the expense, and show that the sheep had cost him more for their cure than they were actually worth in the market. Footrot was a trouble that occurred only in certain districts where the soil was too rich and the herbage too moist. Then came the constant dressing of the feet of the sheep with bluestone, or the squatter got out his \" butyr of antimony,\" another popular remedy; but loss and anxiety always followed the appearance of the disease. Catarrh was little known in Victoria after the first few years. It did some havoc along the Murray district for a time, but the climate of the country seemed unfavourable for its development, and with no great trouble the squatters found themselves practically rid of it. The dingo pest was also one that did not outlast the very early years. In those times the squatter would often find in the morning that a dozen or two of his lambs, or perhaps of his"], [287, "THE SQUATTLNG ERA.\u2014 1846 TO 1831. 265 sheep, were lying cold with bloodstained throats, having been wantonly worried by the wild dogs. Then would commence a crusade against the yellow devastator; he was hunted out of his lair and shot without mercy. At times the squatters would treat him like a fox, and enjoy the semblance of a day in the Leicester fashion, running him to earth with hounds. The dingos, however, were never numerous, and soon succumbed to the constant exercise of the white man's gun. But their destruction brought on a greater trouble \u2014 the kangaroo pest. When the black man was gone or going, and the dingo destroyed or scared away, there was no check to the spread of kangaroos. The white men had at first killed these animals frequently enough by way of sport ; but kangaroo flesh soon tired on the palate, and where the animals were numerous there soon ceased to be any great amusement in slaughtering them. Meanwhile, the blacks and the dingos that used to feed upon them were no longer acting as a check, the black man mostly living on the white man's rations. Then the kangaroos increased at a prodigious rate ; on some stations they must have doubled ever)- year or two, till the few hundreds which no one troubled about became many thousands ; and as ever)' full-grown kangaroo was supposed to eat as much as a sheep, each kangaroo that cropped the grass diminished by a sheep the number of stock the run was capable of supporting. There came, therefore, a time when the squatter found it necessary to take measures to restrain the numbers of his marsupial neighbours, and large sums had often to be spent in destroying them. It is said that on one station there were as many as ten thousand kangaroos killed every year for six consecutive years, and that even then the number left was ver)- formidable. On some stations, yards were erected to slaughter them in. Long lines of fencing converged to these corrals ; the stockmen moving in line across the station drove the kangaroo down the funnel thus provided, and having gathered them in a dense crowd within the yard, they proceeded to the slaughter. Sometimes two thousand would thus be destroyed in a day.3 But the most trying time of a squatter's life in those days was the latter half of summer, when bush fires were to be expected. From whatever cause it arose, the bush fire was always feared, for the fighting with a long wall of roaring flame and smoke that threatened to roll upon and devour the labour of years was a time of unremitting toil and sickening anxiety. The fire as a rule occurred when a hot wind was blowing, and when, beneath a blazing sun, the thermometer stood at a temperature at which ever)' sort of work was a burden. But then it was that the squatter, if a line of smoke became visible at a distance, had to prepare himself for the most painful labour, the most unremitting slavery of the year. Some match let fall by a careless fellow, the embers of some travelling stranger's fire, or accidental causes that never were discovered, would set the dry grass in a blaze ; the flames took hold of the dried branches and the scorched-up leaves, and ere the squatter with his men could be present, the rolling smoke, with its shooting tongues of flame, would be crackling and roaring and spluttering in a line so long that only the most laborious efforts would enable the opposing line of men to combat it with success. Each armed with the green branch of a tree, the station hands tried their best to smother the flames ; but, as water was not to be had, the process was usually slow. Oftentimes the line of arduous toilers were at their posts all da)- long, with the fierce rays of the midsummer sun beating upon their bended backs, while the atmosphere of mingled smoke and sickly vapours and dust, and the white ashes of calcined trees, blinded them, and turned the perspiration that clung to their faces into a thick coating of grime and dirt, while an occasional flare, when the flames touched a few dry ferns or brushwood dry as tinder, would blister or 3 Curr's *' Seiuatting in Victoria,\" p. 1S4."], [288, "266 VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. scar their bodies. When night came there was perhaps no possibility of leaving the spot where, between the long expanse of blackened earth and smouldering stumps on one side, and the waving grass or rustling forest on the other, that long snake-like line of smouldering smoking fire moved slowly forward, still unconquered. So all through that night, and perhaps another day \u2014 sometimes a second night and a third day \u2014 the weary squatter would be there, with scarce a mouthful of food, scarce a glass of water, till cases were often known wherein he fainted with the strain ; yet when the fire was conquered a careful watch had to be set lest a spark from some stump, apparently extinguished, but still smouldering, might set the place once more in a blaze; for a night or two afterwards there would be heard the frequent crash of blackened trees that had been half burnt through at the roots. When the squatter was prepared for fire the prospect generally meant more watchfulness but less labour. If caught at the very beginning the conflagration was always manageable. Yet the worst period of bush fires that the country ever saw was one that was looked forward to long beforehand. The month of January 185 1 had been very warm, with not a shower to cool the burning earth. The grass was yellow and dry, the leaves of the forest were brittle. Then came the morning of the 6th of February, 185-1, a Thursday, and long remembered as Black Thursday. It was close and sultry, and not a breeze was wafted over the gasping soil. On that day over all the country, at widely distant points, fires broke out within the bush. The hot wind that arose in the afternoon only helped to intensify the danger; for before it the flames swept onward at a speed never before observed. The whole Portland Bay district seemed to be on fire, and a great pall of black smoke hung over the country, and was carried out by the north wind to creep over the surface of ocean, and the burnt leaves that had been whirled high into the air in the upward rush of the fire draught descended on the decks of vessels far out at sea. It is said that some were even carried across to Tasmania. On very many stations the effort to stop the fire was at once abandoned, and all attention devoted to the homestead, where wet blankets were applied to roof and walls all day and all night. Sometimes the shepherds managed to save their sheep by the contrivance of burning the grass behind them, and then driving them forward upon the blackened ground before the main body of the fire could overtake them. But the loss of stock was enormous. One station alone lost four thousand sheep ; many houses were burnt, and the inhabitants forced to flee ; on many stations the homestead was saved only by concentrating all efforts upon it, and suffering the huts, the woolsheds, and the fencing to be destroyed. Many persons had very narrow escapes ; indeed, it was surprising that so few lost their lives when death had been imminent to so many. A number of shepherds, caught unprepared in their loneliness, were burnt to death or died afterwards from the effects of excessive toil in the midst of a dangerous heat. A settler named M'Lellan, who had a house on the Plenty River, went out to fight the flames ; in his absence, the fire swept round, consumed his dwelling, his wife and his five children, who had been so caught by a lateral spread of the flames that escape was impossible, and their bodies when recovered were terribly scorched and charred. But in most cases, even where the rushing wall of flame advanced and swept away in a few minutes the homestead, the furniture, the garden and the orchard, yet the inmates found some open spot, a paddock of short grass, a field of green stuff, where they could shelter themselves with the few things they had been able to hurry out of the burning dwelling. Some took shelter in the nearest waterhole, and there remained for twelve or fifteen hours. In many cases the men had"], [289, "THE SQUATTING ERA.- 1846 TO 1851. 267 to be so rapid in their flight that the animals were left to take care of themselves, and a wild stampede occurred in some places \u2014 cattle, sheep, and horses madly urging onward from the smoke-enveloped crackling that moved behind. It is said that occasionally a half-singed kangaroo could be seen amid the wild consternation bounding along in the mad flight of the panic-stricken crowd. That day was one of anxiety in Melbourne. All round the town at a distance of only a few miles the forests were burning in various places ; Mount Macedon was rarely visible, but when through the grey atmosphere of smoke a glimpse could be got of it, it showed a great column of ascending fire. When night came on, the streets were impassable, so thick, so suffocating was the atmosphere ; but those who looked abroad had a spectacle as of the whole country on fire, and a lurid glow playing in fits and starts over all the gloomy expanse of the heavens. A stead}' shower of burning cinders, however, kept the citizens in anxiety, and few expected that the night would pass over without a conflagration in the city, when, so dry were the dwellings, the larger part would probably have been consumed had the fire taken hold in an}- spot. At Portland the 6th of February had been the day fixed for the local races, and in spite of the heat the meeting was held in the morning. It is said that the majority of the visitors were so busy in the booths that they did not observe the fire till it was close upon them. The light sheds of timber were devoured in a minute or two, and it was with difficult}- that some of the crowd escaped with their lives."], [290, "268 VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. Next day the wind changed ; a cool breeze from the south-west drove the flames back upon their blackened course of the previous day. They had nothing to feed on. In some places, for fifteen miles in a stretch, there was nothing but coal-black earth and prostrate trunks all charred to cinder, while over all the land there was a smell as of some mighty roasting that had been going forward. The fire was extinguished by the hreeze from the south, but rain did not come for some time after. When at last it did fall it was copious and refreshing. The green grass was in a day or two faintly making its tint perceptible in the dreary landscape, and ere a month was passed the grasses were fresher and more succulent than they had ever been, and man)- a squatter who had lost heavily by the fire, recovered more than he had lost by the subsequent improvement of his run. Some of the poorer men whose immediate necessities were great, were assisted by means of contributions. Four days after the fatal Thursday a meeting was held at the Mechanics' Institute in Melbourne, and a systematic effort was made by the luckier colonists to assist those others whom fires had left in distress. Melbourne itself suffered more from flood than from fire. It was little more than a year since people had been able to land from boats in Flinders lane. There had been two disastrous floods, the first in October 1844, when the Yarra rose ver)- suddenly and, overflowing its banks, ceased to follow its proper channel ; spreading out into a wide sheet of waters, it entered the sea along the Sandridge beach. All the stores and foundries beside the river banks were submerged. From the Custom House there was nothing to be seen in front but three miles and more of rushing waters. In Richmond and in some of the lower lying parts of the city wooden houses were swept away, and several persons, but it was never known how many, perished in the darkness of that night in October. On 1st September, 1849, Melbourne saw what it has never seen since. Those who rose early enough in the morning found the streets covered with a foot of snow. But it lasted no great time. So soon as the sun appeared, the snow rapidly disappeared; but as the fall had been general over the district, the immediate effect was to overcharge the Yarra, which again played havoc with the property of Melbourne. Two grocers had to lament the loss of twenty or thirty tons of sugar each \u2014 gone to sweeten Port Phillip ; a large building, estimated to be worth fifteen hundred pounds, was swept away; and many small cottages, lifted from their slender moorings, started on unexpected trips down the river, sometimes with inmates in them, who were with difficulty rescued. Indeed, two of these unfortunate people failed to obtain assistance, and being carried off by the whirling floods, were drowned. A great quantity of poultry, together with cattle, and pigs, and sheep were drowned ; one man, a little way out of town, lost no less than 2300 sheep. The former flood, occurring with inexplicable suddenness, had caused a desire to know something more of this Yarra, whose origin was still enshrouded in mystery. During the following year, 1845, Robert Hoddle organised an expedition to discover its source. Accompanied by stalwart assistants, experienced bushmen all, he penetrated to that beechen forest high upon the Dividing Range, where the infant river takes its first leap seaward. It was only ninety miles to the north-east of Melbourne, yet he was five months in the trip, and he reported that the toil was incredible. Up in those tangled ravines of mighty timber, through those thickets with scarce an opening, those wild hollows that sleep so silent between Mount Juliet and the Baw Baw Range, they moved in a country where a progress of a mile a da}- was to be effected only by the most laborious of efforts. At times the only hope of advancement lay in abandoning"], [291, "THE SQUATTING ERA.\u2014 1846 TO 1831. 269 the forest, and in crawling on hands and knees up the slippery rocks, along the mossy ledges of the brawling stream, beneath high impending cliffs or steep slopes of impenetrable thicket on either hand. But the task was accomplished, and the river traced to its origin. The Yarra was not the only stream that occasionally caused devastation by the suddenness of its rise. The Goulburn and the Barwon at times carried off the flocks depastured near them, and more than once the Ovens drowned the settler or shepherd who had fixed his dwelling too close to the water's edge. But in those days fatalities more frequently occurred in the passage of the swollen streams when the winter rains had stirred them to a mad impetuosity. Not a bridge then spanned the river, and the man who had ridden a hundred times into a stream, or driven his trap across it in safety, sometimes was unlucky enough to try the ford yet another time, and that once too often. Very many were the deaths that so occurred in those days, when roads were not yet made, when a man might ride from Melbourne to Portland and see not a fence the whole way, unless he turned out of the track and chanced to notice the horse paddock or garden of some homestead by the way. And that two-wheeled open vehicle which formed the mail carriage, and started every Tuesday morning to carry on the entire passenger traffic from Portland to Melbourne, had an uneasy passage upon that broken track. Three passengers formed its limit ; one sat beside the driver and two sat behind, ready to leap for their lives when the vehicle threatened to overturn, or to be dismembered by the gum trees when the driver abandoned the bottomless mud of the track and endeavoured to pilot his way among the saplings. Yet that was the leading highway of the colony, with the sole exception of the forty-five miles from Geelong to Melbourne. The squatters' realm was thus a region of Arcady; in the sweet simplicity of primeval days, untroubled of bridges or roads, much less of railways or telegraphs ; but in that world of pastoral silence, in a restful seclusion, the squatters throve. In five years their sheep doubled, till the number was more than six millions, and the value of the station produce trebled. Meanwhile the squatter was beginning to be free from his old trouble, the dearth of labour. The news of prosperity at Port Phillip spreading through England in that time of great commercial depression which had culminated in the suspension of the bank charter, sent a stream of sturdy emigrants out to the colony. It is true that this was only a small trickle from the vast current that then was leaving the old country. After the terrible times of 1846 and 1847, two millions of the Irish had sought for other homes beyond the waters, and England and Scotland sent forth their tens of thousands. The vast majority landed on American shores ; but Port Phillip received a useful share. In 1848 there came six thousand, in 1849 twelve thousand, in 1850 seven thousand people, and these, with the ample birth-rate of the colony itself, doubled the population in five years. The squatter therefore found labour of all sorts easy to be had at rates that were not heavy upon him, though they seemed like little fortunes to the new arrivals. Meantime this prosperity had greatly quickened the shipping interests of the colony, which now saw no less than 555 vessels arrive in a year, with an average burthen of 216 tons a-piece. In 1847 the first attempt had been made to provide a regular steam communication with Europe ; the India and Australia Royal Mail Steam Packet Company issued its prospectus in May of that year, with James Cain, Robert Jamieson, and E. C. Hobson as local directors. but it had only a short and calamitous career. It accepted from the English Government a contract for carrying the mails to Australia, and after struggling for six months to get the first steamer despatched, it succumbed to financial difficulties, and entered the winding-up court. The first steamer that made the voyage from England to Melbourne was the Sarah Sands, and she"], [292, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 270 continued to trade backwards and forwards at irregular intervals for some years. But much more than this was wanted, both in the colonies and in England. In August 1850 the merchants of Glasgow and Plymouth petitioned the English Parliament to provide for a steam mail service to Australia. In supporting that petition Lord Naas stated that in 1848 the average length of time occupied in the transit of mails was 121 days; that the shortest time had been 99 days, the longest 159; a state of affairs which he thought ought not to continue. A good steam vessel under ordinary circumstances might traverse the distance in seventy days. A long and acri monious debate followed, for the universal desire in England was that speedier communication should be provided for; while the East India Company blocked the way and used its influence to cause the rejection of an offer by the Peninsular and Oriental Company, which was ready to run a branch line of steamers from India, by way of Singapore. These difficulties were eventually overcome, but it was not till September 1852 that the company despatched its first steamer to Melbourne, the Chusau, followed in two months by the Formosa. Meanwhile the Australian Steam Navigation Company had been formed. Its steamers came by the Cape of Good Hope, the first two being the Australia and the Sydney in 1853, while in that year also appeared the Great Britain, then regarded as a vessel of stupendous size and power. But long before that time the development of trade by sailing vessels had been enormous. During the year 1851 it increased nearly fifty per cent, and that year witnessed the arrival of 712 ships in Melbourne and Geelong. And to provide for the safety of this increasing shipping the Government at Sydney resolved on the erection of several lighthouses. In 1842 the matter had been taken in hand; funds could be provided for two lighthouses, and it was settled that one should be erected on Gabo Island, at Cape Howe, while a prolonged discussion took place as to the situation of the other. Some members of the Legislative Council argued for King's Island as the most suitable ; some maintained the superior claims of Cape Otway. The decision was in favour of the latter position, but nothing was done in the matter for four years, till the loss of the Cataraqui brought the indignant attention of the public to bear on the delay. Then forthwith tenders were called for ; Latrobe himself twice traversed on foot that wild and rocky coast, starting from Port Fairy and passing round to Geelong, the first to enjoy the pleasures of exploring that shore now so famous as a holiday resort, unless we except the four shipwrecked survivors of the Joanna, who several years before had forced their way through terrible hardships, eight days in succession, to a place of succour. Latrobe reported his observations to the Admiralty, and took a large share of personal interest in the construction of the warning light. The Queenscliff lighthouse had already been erected ; it was first lighted for the guidance of the inward-bound mariner in April 1843. The steady growth of the population of the colony, which in 1850 amounted to 76,000 persons, brought with it the formation of new towns and the growth of the seaports. At Port Fairy, where Mr. Griffiths, of Van Diemen's Land, had for several years kept up a fishing station, a small town was beginning to rise, which was first set down on the maps of 1845 as the town of Port Fairy; but in 1847 James Atkinson bought 5000 acres, and laid out a por tion in allotments, which he offered for sale under the title of Belfast, after the name of his native city. He brought round a shipload of Irish emigrants from Sydney, with their wives and families, and settled them upon this fertile estate, granting them leases at the rate of two and a-half bushels per acre per annum. But as the township increased, the proprietor refused to sell any more land, wishing to dispose of it on building leases, and in consequence of complaints the Government surveyed a second township on the other side of the River Moyne."], [293, "THE SQUATTING ERA.\u2014 1846 TO 1831. 271 This was Called Belfast East, but its site was never so popular as the other.' The harbour was unsafe, and a few scattered wrecks, showing their blackening ribs from out the sands, suggested that the sea took heavy toll of the traffic to that part of the colony. But Belfast made a very convenient port to those splendid pastoral lands behind, where a hundred squatters had their ten thousand bales of wool to ship each year. So the cottages of milk-white limestone rose on the space between the sea-beach and the stately forest that overhung the waters of the River Moyne, till in 1846 the little town had a population of 269 persons. In 1847 it rose to the dignity of a county town with an annual and popular race-meeting, and in September 1850 it saw itself lit with gas.5 But the fine agricultural lands across the water at the mouth of the Hopkins proved to be more attractive to settlers, and on the 30th of January, 1847, the first proclamation was made of town lands on the site of Warrnambool. In July of that year 166 allotments of half-an-acre each were sold by public auction at Brodie's rooms, in Elizabeth-street, Melbourne. With surprising rapidity the town sprang up on the undulating ground enclosed between the river and the sea. The little peninsula, all cleared of timber, was cut off from the forest beyond by a fence, which prevented the town cattle from straying.6 Its name was given it by Mr. Pickering, the Government surveyor, after the native appellation of a hill beyond the Hopkins River. The luxuriant herbage and the richness of the soil for farming purposes made the little place charming with its verdure to the eyes of the new-comer ; but a corresponding disadvantage arose in the excessive muddiness of the streets in wet weather. Steadily the town increased; the formation of a pier gave it an impetus, till in 1851 it was able to boast its first newspaper, the Warrnambool Examiner. Another of these agricultural towns sprang up on the Sydney-road north of Mount Macedon, where an area of 5120 acres was bought by a gentleman named Rutledge. He cut this district into small farms, whereon potato growing proved so immediately remunerative as to attract quite a little colony to this corner, where rich farms could be had in small blocks at a low rent. A township called Kilmore was marked off by the proprietor, and its allotments readily sold, but a government township also sprang up along the main road, where the usual line of buildings, an inn or two, a store, a blacksmith's shop, and so forth, straeeled on either side of the mud or dust of the highway. A little pastoral village had also sprung up on the slopes of Mount Buninyong, a sleepy place in peaceful seclusion, soon to be startled by the mad inroad of fortune-seeking diggers. There were other little townships forming the first nucleus of population. Ballan had a house or two beside its hotel. The Grange was now converted into South Hamilton, and a new township called North Hamilton was rising with all the promise of a prosperous suture ; a little suburb to the south of the Grange Burn being already in process of formation by some Prussian immigrants who had taken up small farms there. But the main concentration of town population still went on at Portland, Geelong, and Melbourne. Portland, in 1846, contained five hundred people, and supported two newspapers; in 1851 it had advanced to nearly two thousand, and had a large export of wool from the Glenelg and Wannon districts behind it. The appearance of the place began to be imposing, its handsome police court, its new post-office, its Customs house, its survey office, its gaol, all standing high ; two banks, and a benevolent asylum, a mechanics' institute, and some good hotels, giving 1 Bonwick's \"Western Victoria, 1858,\" p. 65. \u25a0 Rolf Boldrewood, p. 25. \u00ab Osburne, \"History of Warrnambool,\" p. 273.

Geelong was meanwhile growing, but in the form of five scattered villages, each round its own nucleus. There were the government townships of North and South Geelong, as already described, with a united population in 1846 of 1370 persons; but the high upset price of land, .\u00a3150 an acre, had driven the poor but industrious immigrant to settle on the suburban lands which speculators had bought at \u00a35 an acre and sold in small pieces at perhaps four times that rate. Hence there grew up Ashby, and Irishtown and Newtown, each about a mile from the nearest government township. The united population of these places amounted to 695, giving a total for Geelong in 1846 of over two thousand persons. But the northern portion, beside Corio Bay,, was that which showed the greatest concentration of people, for there, in 1840, had the convict gangs of Government built the first substantial wharf along the shore, and thither came many a fine clipper from England to load with wool, and thither traded four steamers with Melbourne; the old Aphrasia, after having seven years of the trade all to herself, being now joined by the Thames, the Kangaroo, and the Columbia. The first three-masted vessel that ascended the bay, named the Socrates, struck on the bar, and there was much difficulty in floating her off. This led to some efforts for the removal of the bar, which seemed likely to be successful, and some writers of the years 1845 and 1846 prophesied that, with that encumbrance gone, the prospects of Geelong were more hopeful even than those of Melbourne. But that remarkable town showed no signs of lagging behind in the race, or losing the ample start it had acquired. It was now quite a little city, with nearly twenty thousand inhabitants, and with five flourishing suburbs. That which most attracted attention was Brighton, where the successful men of business were already forming for themselves secluded retreats on the breezy shores of the Bay. The first year or two of its history are well chronicled in the blue-books of the period ; for, in regard to it, there was fought out what was then regarded as a notable battle on an important point. In 1840 the Colonial Office in England had extended to Port Phillip the principle of \" special surveys,\" which had for two or three years been in force in South Australia. Any person who paid the sum of \u00a35120 into the Treasury in London could thereupon receive an order to receive as many acres, or eight square miles, in the colony. The first who took advantage of this system was Mr. Henry Dendy, who arrived in February 1841, and presented his order to Latrobe. He could not have startled that gentleman more if he had presented a pistol at him, for on that order for the selection of eight square miles of land there was no sort of restriction, except that it must be in one block, and not more than twice as long as it was broad ; by it the fortunate holder was authorised to monopolise the whole suburban area of Melbourne if he liked, or to absorb into his sole possession the most likely township he saw in process of formation. How valuable this document was became apparent to the fortunate Dendy on his arrival, for he was immediately offered .\u00a315,000 for it. This was refused, and it is said that various increased sums were offered, till in the course of a month or two .\u00a360,000 was declined, the holder of the order considering it as equivalent to at least \u00a380,000, though he had paid only a little more than \u00a35000 for it less than a year before. Latrobe referred the matter to Gipps, who was equally dismayed. He refused to ratify the proceeding, and declined to allow Dendy to select his land until communication could be held with the Colonial Office. He immediately wrote, expostulating and utterly"], [295, "THE SQUATTING ERA. -1846 TO iSji. 273 condemning the new regulations, which he said would completely upset the land sales of the colony. If Mr. Dendy had come a little earlier he might have bought the whole of Portland for \u00a35120, whereas a very small area of it, about acres, had really brought in over \u00a317,000. If Mr. Dendy takes eight square miles in the neighbourhood of Melbourne, there is no foretelling what will be the loss to the public revenue. Latrobe offered him his choice if he came no nearer to Melbourne than ten miles, but he declined. Throughout the year a long and continuous correspondence was maintained, and a compromise was effected. The Colonial Office rescinded the regulations, but felt in honour bound to assert the validity of those orders already issued. Gipps, however, carried his point so far that Dendy was not allowed to choose his land nearer than six miles from the centre of Melbourne. He had thus to examine the land in a circle of that radius round the city, and he naturally chose the spot where that circle cut the shores of the bay. There, as he well foresaw, the villa residences must arise of those who sought the sea-air, and there he selected his eight square miles. His affairs, however, became involved in the depression of the times, and this fine estate passed into the hands of his lawyers, who caused that portion of it which lay along the shore to be laid out in allotments by Mr. H. B. Foot, while the parts more inland were surveyed for small farms and market gardens. The township was elaborately planned, and a few stores and shops ere long made their appearance at intervals on the spacious lines that were to be streets ; but the main feature in Brighton, as it was called, was the line of fine properties fronting the sea, whereon the Melbourne merchants one after another raised their handsome mansions or their comfortable villas. In 1846 the population was 509. A second suburb consisting of ornamental cottages and widespread villas of bungalow fashion, surrounded by fine gardens, at this time began to spring up on government land at what was called St. Kilda, a place where there was not a shop nor an inn, the distance from Melbourne being too short to encourage their growth in those days when the \" village,\" as it was called, was exclusively occupied by a score of rural residences.' In 1847 the inhabitants subscribed twenty five pounds, and the Melbourne corporation granted a like sum, to make the first road from the Punt to St. Kilda. Williamstown was not maintaining its early promise. The census of 1846 shows only 322 persons in it, and it was not perceptibly larger than it had been five years before. But at Collingwood and Richmond there were great changes. The working folks of the city had begun to find that it was a mistake to dwell on land that was worth three or four hundred pounds for the half-acre allotment. If they cared to go out upon the suburban land, not two miles away, they could buy or rent good, roomy plots whose value was not as many shillings. Hence the visitor who strolled by the banks of the Yarra found nothing but open park-land, except the Governor's sunn)- dwelling of Jolimont, until he had reached the hill in Richmond. Then as he looked down he saw the scattered wooden cottages in trim plots on the flat below ; and so, also, he who strolled through the hedgerow lanes of what was now called Fitzroy, in honour of the new Governor who succeeded Gipps, looked out upon another flat where the working men were building their cottages and forming the suburb of Collingwood. The only other suburb was that of Brunswick, so called after Robert Brunswick Smyth, the commandant of the mounted troopers of the colony. The land was originally sold in farms of ninety and a hundred acres for agricultural purposes, but as it was on the Sydney- ' \" Five Years' Experience in Australia Felix,\" by G. H. Haydon."], [296, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 274 road an hotel and surrounding buildings soon gave it a village aspect, and in 1846 it contained a population of 146 persons, including of course those who occupied the adjacent farms. Heidelberg was scarcely a suburb ; it was rather a favourite district for those who desired to have ample domains round their dwellings. Until 1S50 it was regarded as the distinctly aristocratic locality ; the beauty of the river scenery, and the quiet romantic aspect of the place, gave it an early reputation among the Melbourne men of means as the site for country residences. And, moreover, the land had been placed in the hands of one of the most fascinating and adroit of land agents. On behalf of Mr. Walker, the original purchaser, he advertised the districts in the most flowery language, and by the assistance of champagne lunches contrived to dispose of the land in estates of considerable size at a very sufficient profit. It was to him that the place owed its name. His enthusiasm as to the beauties he had seen in his European travels was so great that he was familiarly known as \" Continental Brown,\" and in one of his raptures he had likened the view from the hill overlooking the Yarra to that over the terraced slopes where the ancient Heidelberg nestles by the side of the silver Neckar.8 And Dr. Lang confesses\" that the resemblance is not wholly fanciful. Thither came Captain Robert Brunswick Smyth, and David C. Macarthur, and Joseph Hawdon, and John Bolden, and Dr. Martin, and Mr. Justice Willis, all local celebrities, who built good houses, laid out fine parks with pleasant drives and luxurious gardens, and made the place notable for its elegance; the finest house, however, being that of Mr. Thomas Wills, near the Darebin Creek, a handsome dwelling, with pillared front and ample balconies, and terraces sweeping down through a delightful garden. Thus Melbourne, in its twelve or thirteen years of existence, had assumed a goodly aspect ; its suburbs extending, its streets filling up with buildings, its pathways being formed, though not yet lit with gas ; the stumps all cleared from the roadways, on which handsome equipages were now frequently to be seen ; three or four cabs were ranged in row in Collins street for hire. The Scots' Church on the hill of Collins-street, St. James' Cathedral, St. Francis' Roman Catholic Chapel, and the Wesleyan Church were all buildings that surprised the visitor as being much finer than could have been expected in a city still but an infant among cities. It had moreover become essentially English in its ways and in its aspect ; and several of the writers who describe it as it appeared about 1850, speak of the strong resemblance it bore to a staid and steady country town in the motherland. It was now a place of quiet prosperity ; the days of its mad speculations were all gone, so its citizens thought ; it was a bright little town, with tranquil ways and sunny streets, not marked by any noisy bustle ; its future was full of hope, with years of steady but silent progress. So prophesied the visitor who saw it in these days, all unconscious of the wild excitement, the riot, the frenzy that was to possess the dreamy city ere another year should bring its revolving months once more round to the same date.

Nor was there ever any substantial reason why they should |^\u00a7|| flip1] have been annexed to New South Wales instead of forming, as the people of \u2014 Adelaide did, a new colon)* from the very commencement. That the Port Phillip settlement, which was in truth the result of a new and independent process of colonisation, should not have been regarded from the first as a new colony, was the result of merely verbal causes When Captain Phillip brought his first fleet to Australia, laden with exiles, he bore with him a commission that proclaimed him Governor of that half of the continent which lay to the east of the 135th meridian.' He was thus supposed to found a colony embracing an extent of territory equal to the unwieldy dominion of Russia in Europe. It was only a sort of figure of speech ; it was a form of words easily written upon a parchment commission, but meaning little enough in the way of fact ; it was intended only to assert the British sovereignty over that half of Australia which was then unclaimed, the Dutch being, figuratively, the possessors of the western half. That was when England was at peace with Holland, and when the newly-formed treat}* had to be sacredly conserved with no possible ground of offence given to the aquatic ' Flanagan, I. p. 30."], [298, "276 VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. republic. But in the Napoleonic wars, Holland for a time sided with the great dictator, and England stripped her of most of her colonies. After that date there was no pretence made of acknowledging the Dutch claim to the half of Australia. British control was tacitly assumed over the whole continent. But in practice it meant nothing. The convict colony, so far from exercising sovereignty over all Australia, was confined to a radius of twenty or thirty miles from Sydney. Indeed, a quarter of a century had to elapse ere the first intrepid explorers succeeded in crossing the barrier of the Blue Mountains, less than forty miles distant. And when another equal space of time was gone, though the Sydney settlers had spread abroad in wondrous manner, yet their outlying stations were no further away than two hundred miles from Sydney. And from these uttermost points of occupation there stretched far to the south towards Port Phillip four hundred miles of wilderness, only once traversed by the foot of civilised man, forming a most formidable barrier between the Sydney district and the new settlement. There was nothing then to associate the two but that mere chance of territorial union which arose from the vague terms of a commission drawn up in 1787, for a political purpose, by men who did not possess, and had never seen, a complete map of Australia \u2014 for that continent had then been only half discovered, and not half charted. Sir Richard Bourke, when he interfered with the intruders that were proposing to appropriate the lands around Port Phillip, found a legal justification in the terms of that old commission which clearly included the new district. But he does not seem to have regarded that commission as being more than a pretext for taking temporary charge. From the first, the tone of his despatches indicates that he considers the new settlement as practically an independent effort at colonisation, and he takes an early opportunity of urging on the Colonial Office the undesirability of treating it as an integral portion of New South Wales. It is too far away, it is too widely severed by unoccupied lands, to be so regarded. Indeed, he asserts that Launceston is the natural mart to which the inhabitants of Port Phillip will for some time resort. He therefore recommends the appointment of a Lieutenant-Governor with a separate staff and a new judge ; in short, Bourke's despatch contemplates the formation of a new colony, dependent, perhaps, on the Governor at Sydney, yet with a dependence merely nominal as that of Tasmania had for a long time been. But in the immediate present, the Colonial Office preferred to avoid expense, and to appoint only a superintendent who should be much more closely dependent on the authorities at Sydney than Bourke had intended. That Governor was now departed, and Gipps was new to the position. He was a Governor by no means inclined to give his advice unless when requested. He preferred to let the Colonial Office manage such matters after its own fashion. Yet that fashion most certainly contemplated the formation of a distinct colony so soon as the extent of its population would justify the expense of a separate Government. That such a step was regarded by Lord Glenelg as being by no means remote is shown in his solicitude that the accounts of the new settlement should be kept entirely distinct from those of New South Wales.\" In 1839 Lord John Russell assumed the administration of colonial affairs. His views as to the ultimate separation of the district seem to have been the same as those of his predecessor, Glenelg. On the 31st of May, 1840, he sent a despatch to Sir Ceorgc Gipps, instructing him as to the new regulations that were then being framed for the sale of land. The old principle of auction at an upset price of twelve shillings per acre was still to apply -Despatch, given in full, Labilliere, II. 151."], [299, "SEPARATION FROM NEW SOUTH WALES.\u2014 1840 TO 1831. 277 to the older parts of the colony, but the southern or Port Phillip district was to be made in its land regulations uniform with South Australia ; its lands were to be sold at a fixed uniform price\u2014 that \" sufficient price \" which the followers of Wakefield had declared to be one pound per acre. In this Southern District the land was to be sold in areas of not less than 320 acres at one pound per acre. This despatch of Lord John Russell's gives distinct boundaries for the \" Southern or Port Phillip District.\" It was to consist of all the territory south of the Murrumbidgee River, and therefore included not only the present territory of Victoria, but also the whole of the Riverina. The land sales for all this southern district were to be held in Melbourne, and all charts, registers, and documents connected with them were to be kept in that town. The arrival of this despatch was the first clear intimation of the purpose evidently entertained by the Colonial Office of converting Port Phillip into a new colony ere long. But it was very natural that the influential portion of Sydney society should object to such a process of dismemberment, which not only diminished the prestige of that city, but also promised to interfere with some of its trade. But nothing could be done to prevent it, and the only course they could follow was to circumscribe the area of the new district as far as possible by securing the withdrawal of the Riverina from it. Up to 1838 the finances of the Sydney Government had been in a very unsound condition, but in that year the revival of land sales had set them on a better footing, and the loss of a district such as the Riverina, whose value for land sales even at that time must have been more than five millions of pounds, was not a blow to be received without some effort at defence. Early in December Gipps announced the receipt of this despatch containing the new regulations, and at once called a meeting of his Legislative Council to consider it. A long discussion took place, but it led to a unanimous resolution that a petition should be sent to the Queen, praying her to reconsider this proposed dismemberment of the territory. A committee was appointed to prepare this petition, in which the suggestion of Bishop Broughton was adopted that, after desiring the Queen not to consent to this anticipated dismemberment, it should also be asked that if the separation should after all be carried out, yet New South Wales should not lose so large a part of her territory, that the Riverina at least should be left to her and that the boundary of the new colony, if new colony there must be, should be fixed along the course of the Murray rather than of the Murrumbidgee. The prayer of this latter part of the petition was granted. Before it could reach London Lord John Russell had yielded up his office to Lord Stanley, and that nobleman without delay consented to the proposed alteration, a concession which at once reduced the area of the Port Phillip district from 135,000 to 88,000 square miles, and as the new boundaries formed the basis of all subsequent negotiations in regard to the separation of the district, his action had the effect of permanently diminishing the territory of Victoria. However, it was clear enough in 1840 that in so far as the Colonial Office was concerned there was contemplated the early formation of a new colony, and there were no social ties in Melbourne to form an opposition to such a purpose. Had the population of Port Phillip come from Sydney ; had they there left their friends and relatives ; had they been disposed by custom to look on that city as their metropolis, the wishes of the Colonial Ministers would have met an obstacle in the tendency of their sentiments. But it was far otherwise. Of the twenty thousand people whom the district contained in 1841 not a thousand had come from Sydney ; three-fourths of them were straight from the old country"], [300, "VICTORIA AND ITS MERTOPOLLS: PAST AND PRESENT. 278 \u2014 men to whom Sydney was nothing \u2014 men on whose affections it had no hold, on whose allegiance it had no claim. Hence it is not in the least surprising to find the settlers of Port Phillip seizing with eagerness upon that idea of separation which Lord Glenelg and Lord John Russell had distinctly indicated. The first action taken by the colonists themselves occurred so far back as nth June, 1840, when a number of gentlemen met at the Auction Company's rooms to talk over the proposal to separate, which was then a common enough topic of daily conversation. They agreed to call a public meeting and prepare a memorial for presentation to the Queen, to whom another address was then being prepared by another committee, an address of congratulation upon her marriage, which had taken place in the previous February. The \" Separation Committee,\" as it was called, appears to have taken no immediate steps, but towards the end of the year the arrival of a preliminary account of the new land laws, with the provision for a territorial separation of Port Phillip from New South Wales, stirred them up to action, and they called the intended public meeting. It was held on the second last day of 1840, at the store of Mr. Isaac Hind,3 in Flinders-lane, near Queen-street, a wooden building, mainly consisting of a large shed, beneath whose frail roof there gathered frequent crowds to the auctions that were held by Mr. Hind. Here there was ample room for a crowd to stand, and merchants, squatters, and professional men gathered in considerable numbers to take part in this, the first incident in the struggle for separation. The chair was taken by William Verner, the commissioner of insolvent estates. The most important address was that delivered by Dr. Bernard, a gentleman of scientific attainments then resident in Melbourne. He is said to have spoken for fully an hour, and to have carried to his hearers the conviction that they were a race of men shamefully oppressed and despoiled by the Sydney Government. Such a position, of course, provided the means of declamatory effect, but it was one of those cries which naturally arise in times of political conflict, and wise men are too cautious to put much faith in them. Port Phillip had, as a matter of fact, received no unworthy treatment at the hands of Gipps and his Sydney Council, though there were points in dispute about which there might easily be two opinions. But the fact was that the colonists at Melbourne disliked the expense, the trouble, the delay incurred when the centre of local government was six hundred miles away, and it is true also that Sir George Gipps had not strictly complied with the instructions of the Colonial Office to keep the land revenue of Port Phillip distinct from the finances of New South Wales. He had entered on his Government with not only an empty exchequer, but, indeed, with a heavy deficit, and when debts had to be paid and there was no money to pay them with, the temptation to treat all receipts as being the general revenue of the colony, and to apply them to meet the exigencies of public business, seems to have been difficult to resist. But the extent of any such misapplication was slight, and the colonists at Port Phillip were indulging in hyperbole when they described themselves as labouring under any sort of \" oppression.\" However, they were entitled, under the circumstances, to form a separate colony if they so wished, and that declamatory eloquence was only an artifice to rouse the people to make an unanimous demand for that privilege which was theirs by right. After Dr. Bernard there came Redmond Barry, in the youthful persuasiveness of those mellifluous tones from county Cork ; and George Arden, then the journalist of the place, and burning to be its orator, fired off his fervid speech with tripping tongue ; and a few of the squatters \u2014 A.

The petition was duly prepared and signed by about two thousand inhabitants of the district. But the committee was not inclined to remain content with this ; they called another meeting in the following March. This was held at a different store, and was of a more formal character. A memorandum was drawn up, and ordered to be printed for circulation among the members of the British Parliament, before whom the question was likely to appear sooner or later. This paper is a highly argumentative document ; but, although in the main true, it is not always in the best of taste, and must have proved exasperating to the colonists of the Sydney district. According to this memorandum, the settlers of Port Phillip are deeply grieved at their enforced connection with a penal depot, with what Arden had described as the \" slop basin of the British Empire.\" This argument was an after-thought and an offensive one ; it was quite unnecessary, for the succeeding clause, which showed that from the first it had been intended that Port Phillip should become independent when its population should be ready to undertake the responsibility, as it then was, must have been quite enough to secure for it a favourable hearing without any of the somewhat ponderous reasons given in the earlier and more offensive paragraphs. This petition and its accompanying memorandum reached England just at the time when the ministry of Lord Melbourne and Lord John Russell was fighting for existence. A week or two later a motion of want of confidence was carried against it by one vote; the Government dissolved Parliament : a new house had to be elected ; and there the struggle was completed by the victory of Sir Robert Peel and the retirement of Lord Melbourne into private life for his remaining seven years of case and elegant leisure. Amid this part)- warfare, which was very keen, very bitter, and sometimes a little unscrupulous, there was no room for the affairs of Port Phillip ; but Lord John Russell at the close of one of his last despatches referred to the probability that Port Phillip would shortly be made an independent colony. This caused much gratification in Melbourne ; but it had little value, for Lord John Russell was immediately afterwards succeeded by Lord Stanley, whose views were materially different. He did not savour the idea of separation, but was inclined to preserve the unity of the colony ; and as a substitute he provided the settlers with a representative legislature. At his instance, the British Parliament in February 1843 enacted that there should be at Sydney no longer a merely nominee council\u2014 a body consisting of the Governor and half-a-dozen officers nominated by the Governor\u2014 but that a Legislative Council should be constituted, to consist of thirty-six members, of whom twelve were still to be the nominees of the Governor, but the other twenty-four were to be elected by the people, all colonists being entitled to vote who possessed two hundred pounds worth of freehold property, or who were tenants of a dwelling of annual value not less than twenty pounds. Of the twenty-four elective members, six were to be returned by Port Phillip\u2014 one for the town and five for the district. This was a very fair proportion, and quite consistent with the relative populations of the older and newer parts of the colon)-. Lord Stanley seems to have thought that the people of Port Phillip could now have no grievance; their representatives could explain their wants and secure their rights in the deliberations of this new legislature; and at first the matter was so regarded in Melbourne also. A few warning voices were raised; one K Vol. 1."], [302, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLLS: PAST AND PRESENT. 280 or two enthusiasts foretold that nothing would result from the change, but their forebodings were drowned in the excitement of the coming election. It was a very notable innovation, this Constitution of 1843. For before that time all the colonies were Crown colonies. They were directly and completely under the rule of the Colonial Office in London. The Briton at home had jealously guarded and stoutly defended his right to be taxed, his privilege to be legislated for, only by his representatives duly elected by the votes of the nation. But to the Briton abroad, all these glories of his race, all these liberties won by his fathers, were lost. He had no vote, no voice, no influence, upon the Government of his country. His destiny was moulded for him, so far as legislation went, in that office in Downing-street which owed a nominal deference to Parliament, but which, in fact, could be controlled but little by a bod)* which knew almost nothing of the colonies, of the colonists, of colonial wants, or of colonial ways. But now, for the first time, the colonist was to taste, to a mild extent, and in a draught carefully weakened down to suit his condition, some of the blessings of representative Government. The election in Port Phillip took place in June 1843, Melbourne being the polling place. There were six candidates for the five seats allotted to the district, and a poll had therefore to be taken. C. H. Ebden obtained the first place, Thomas Walker and Dr. Charles Nicholson being but a little way behind. Dr. Thomson, of Geelong, came fourth, and the contest for the fifth place lay between Sir Thomas Mitchell and the Rev. Dr. Lang. Both of these were Sydney residents, and so were Nicholson, a phy sician, and Thomas Walker, a merchant of that city. It was therefore an instance of what the shrewder observers antici pated when it was found that, in the first election, four out of six candidates were people who knew nothing of the dis- trict, and as little of the district's necessities. No man but one of wealth and leisure could afford to leave the province and take up his residence for five months in the year in a city six hun dred miles away. But the district contained, at that time, no persons of affluence. Men went there to work hard and make their money. If they had been blessed with competence, and had been able to enjoy a tranquil lei sure, they would have been in the last degree unlikely to take up their abodes in a new colon)- that was enduring all the roughness of its early years. REV. DU. LANG. (From photograph kindly supplied by Mrs. Lang.) Sir Thomas Mitchell had many claims. He was regarded at that time as the most notable explorer of the district, and he it was who gave it that popular name of Australia Felix; but he was opposed to the people of Port Phillip on the subject of separation. He had publicly said that New South Wales was like a spread eagle with one of its noble wings at Moreton Bay and the other at Port Phillip, and he was a violent opponent of any scheme that would diminish this gigantic spread. His views on that subject caused him the loss of the fifth seat, which was won by Dr. Lang, with a majority of nine votes. Dr. Lang had been in Melbourne in 1841 at the time when the agitation for separation was beginning; he probably had little sympathy at that period with the movement"], [303, "SEPARATION PROM NEW SOUTH WALES -1840 TO 185 1. 281 but he must have noticed how decided was the desire of the people. Soon afterwards he crossed to America on a self-deputed mission of inquiry as to the result of abolishing State aid to religion. In the course of his inquiries it struck him that the American system was a wise one, which provided for many states, each of which regulated its own local affairs after its own fashion, but left the control of empire to a general congress. In a territory so vast as either the United States or Australia, the attempt to manage all the widely different interests of widely distant people living under many varieties of climate, must, he saw, prove ineffectual. The more completely local affairs could be left to local management the better, he thought, for everybody. Hence, on his second visit to Melbourne, in 1843, ne was favourably disposed to the new agitation, and threw himself into it with all that zeal for which he was remarkable \u2014 a zeal which was too self-assertive, too acrimonious, too uncompromising to suffer him to be generally popular; but which on the other hand was so whole-hearted, so ardent, and so untiring as to entitle the sturdy old doctor to the remembrance of all Victorians. But the leading champion of the separation question was Edward M. Curr, who would have been* the chosen of the electors of Melbourne but for his quarrel with our other champion. Dr. Lang, among the many feuds he had on hand, feuds as fiery as those of his border ancestors, and quite sufficient to keep his life at boiling pitch from first to last, had a specially ardent battle to fight at this time. He was grieved to the soul at the vast preponderance of Roman Catholics among the immigrants. The public money had been freely spent in bringing out immigrants, but it was a sorry sight for so staunch a Presbyterian to sec those immigrants brought for the greater part from the south of Ireland. About two-thirds of them were so derived, and were Roman Catholics. And yet if the emigration agents could induce two thousand Irishmen to emigrate for every one thousand they could obtain from England and Scotland, it is difficult to see how they were to blame. The colony wanted labourers, and the labouring classes who were willing to emigrate were most readily found at Cork, whither the agents naturally went for them. But Lang was uneasy as to the prospect. In 1841 he had published a pamphlet entitled the \" The Question of Questions : or, Is this Colony to be transformed into a province of Popedom ?\" Those who know anything of Dr. Lang's controversial style will readily judge that it was trenchant, but not delicate ; that it expressed the honest indignation of the resolute combatant ; but that it was extremely hurtful to the feelings of the Catholic colonists. Now, Edward Curr was an English Catholic ; a man of education, no doubt, and of liberal sentiments, but still a consistent adherent to the faith of his fathers. He had been the manager of a land and agricultural company in Tasmania, but when it became embarrassed he had carried his stock across in the Eagle schooner in 1839; and in 1841 he had himself taken up his residence in Melbourne, where he had speedily become popular, and that the more readily inasmuch as he had thrown himself from the first into the separation movement with singular ardour, and with a prolixity which, though tedious to a reader of our days, was grateful enough to a public which wished to work up a sufficient crop of grievances to appear as martyrs with a claim to sympathy and redress. So in 1843, when Mr. Curr was nominated for the town of Melbourne, he was unopposed, and his return seemed certain. But then there came to Melbourne that polemic divine, that stormy partisan, Dr. Lang, whose very presence was an insult to a good Catholic, and Mr. Curr was resolved to call him to account in public. When, therefore, Dr. Lang announced a lecture on the popular subject of \" Separation,\" to be delivered in the hall of the Mechanics' Institute, Mr. Curr was there, and"], [304, "282 VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. starting up at the close of the lecture, flourished a copy of the obnoxious pamphlet in the air, asking the lecturer if he was the author of that effusion. An angry altercation took place, in which Air. Curr denounced Dr. Lang as a person wholly unfit to sit in a legislative body, and in the heat of the moment asserted that he would never take his seat in the same assembly with such a person. He reiterated that threat in a letter to one of the newspapers, and plainly intimated that if the community elected Dr. Lang, it must expect to be deprived of his services. The only answer to this menace was the nomination of an opponent, and for that purpose was chosen Mr. Henry Condell, who besides being the mayor and a popular brewer, was a staunch Presbyterian, brought up in the most orthodox circles of Edinburgh. The election was a hotly con tested one, and sectarian feeling ran high, but Mr. Condell was returned by a majority of 295 to 261, to the intense indignation of the Irish part of the popula tion, who regarded their champion as the victim of a mean conspiracy. Several hundred of them stood all the afternoon in Collins-street, clamorous, and inclined to mischief, and indulging in threats of burning the town about the ears of its people. Mr. Curr had some in fluence in pacifying them, but when it became necessary for Mr. Simpson to bid them disperse, they refused. He read the Riot Act. Still they kept their position EDWARD M. CURR on the hillside. The troopers made a mild pretence to charge among them and scatter them, but they formed a little lower down the street on the vacant allotment where now the Town Hall stands. There they held their ground, singing, hooting, threatening, till nightfall came, when a band of about two hundred marched out to smash the windows of the prominent supporters of Dr. Lang. Their most determined attack was made on the house of a Mr. Thomas Green, who carried on business in Elizabeth-street, opposite the Post-office. He defended himself, and they made determined attempts to wrench off his shutters ; he fired on the crowd, and two men were wounded ; one mortally, as it was supposed at the time, though he afterwards recovered. How much further the riot might have proceeded it was difficult to say, but the military had at last been called out ; a detachment of the 8oth regiment came down the Bourke-strect hill from the barracks, and the line of red-coats, without trouble, cleared the streets.1 This unfortunate squabble proved the prelude to a long series of sectarian troubles, culminating three years later in the Orange riots of July 1846, when the members of the Orange Society proposed to celebrate the \"glorious First of July\" at the Pastoral Hotel in Queen street. A grand dinner was there to be held, and the hotel was decorated with yellow flags. A crowd of several hundred Irishmen gathered, armed with guns, pistols, and pitchforks. After some time of street banter, they forced their way into the hotel, and met a number of the Orangemen on the stairs. A scuffle took place, and a few shots were fired from the upper story, when those outside poured a volley through the windows. It was returned by the Orange men from all the windows, and a regular siege was in progress when the Rev. Dr. Geoghegan ' M'Combie, p. 100."], [305, "SEPARATION FROM NEW SOUTH WALES.\u2014 1840 TO 1851. 283 arrived, well known and much respected as the first Roman Catholic priest of Port Phillip. He mingled with the riotous crowd, and endeavoured to persuade the attacking party to retire, while still the bullets frequently whistled from out the upstairs windows. The worth)- priest was in danger, when John O'Shanassy, his intimate friend, rushed in with another friend to carry him out of danger. The friend fell, pierced with a shot in the shoulder, and three others of the crowd were stretched with dangerous wounds upon the road, when the soldiers made their appearance and quelled the disturbance. A few of each party were taken into custody; but during all the night shots were heard, and brawls throughout a foggy winter's midnight kept the streets unquiet, and when the morning broke it was found that the Orangemen held the lower part of the town at the foot of Queen-street, while the Catholics were in force in the upper part of Elizabeth-street, where St. Francis' Church was then in course of completion. Mr. Latrobe had to resort to decided action. All the hotels were ordered to be closed; the police and the military were marched down to Market-street, where they were stationed for a time. They then proceeded to an hotel in Flinders-lane, where about sift}' Orangemen were gathered ; but these no sooner saw the red-coats than they decamped. The troops then marched up Elizabeth-street to the place where the Catholics, eighty strong, were posted across the road. After some little parley the rioters were induced to disband and return to their homes. The town was placed under martial law, and the soldiers bivouacked all night round their watch-fires in the middle of Collins-street, between Elizabeth and Queen streets. The end of the trouble was that a number of the ringleaders were bound over to keep the peace, and Melbourne never had to lament a recurrence of such sorry scenes. The Catholics were restrained by the influence of their kind-hearted priest, a man of austere piety and simple virtues ; and by that stalwart young Irishman, John O'Shanassy, who had come out as an immigrant with his wife in 18^9 in the third bounty vessel that arrived here, the William Metcalfe, and had already acquired the chief ascendancy over his somewhat boisterous compatriots from Tipperary. He had tried farming and cattle-grazing, but the bad times of 1842 had driven him back to town, where he and his wife were at this time keeping a little drapery store in Collins-street.5 His popularity and strong good sense were of service among the inflammable rioters ; soon afterwards the Orangemen built themselves a Protestant Hall in Russell-street, and thenceforth kept their celebrations in less obtrusive fashion. Meantime the elections in which these bitter feelings had originated had long since been completed, and the Legislative Council had gathered at Sydney. But there were only two actual representatives of Port Phillip present; these were Condell an J Ebden. The other, Dr. Thomson, of Geelong, had sailed in ample time, but the steamer was so delayed by unfortunate weather that the session was somewhat advanced before he arrived to take his seat. It was on the 1st of August, 1843, that this, the first assembly of Australia which was in any way representative, met for the election of its speaker, and chose Alexander Macleay. On the 3rd of August the deliberations of the Council commenced, and a busy session passed by, which left no opportunity for the discussion of any Port Phillip business. One of the Governor's nominees had refused to take his seat, and Sir George Gipps appointed in his place Mr. Robert Lowe then a young barrister in Sydney, but afterwards more famous as a prominent figure upon a wider stage. . ... Before the second session began, two of the three Port Phillip residents had resigned their scats. Mr. Ebden could not with safety dwell in Sydney and leave his flocks at Carlsruhc to the 5 William H. Archer, Melbourne Review."], [306, "284 VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. charge of servants. Air. Condell had a brewery in Melbourne that was a comparatively young business, and needed its owner's eye. Their retirement from the position, and the impossibility of inducing any other resident to accept the honour, showed to the people of Port Phillip how empty was their supposed privilege of election. A few persons, about twenty, nominated and elected two Sydney residents \u2014 J. P. Robinson and Adolphus Young. Soon after, Dr. Thomson also resigned, and a Sydney squatter, Benjamin Boyd, was elected in his place. Hence it came to pass in less than a year that in the representative assembly, the district of Port Phillip, which numbered nearly a third of the population of the colony, possessed not a single member who belonged to the district or knew its wants or wishes. It was therefore with a very good case to show that Dr. Lang on the first day of the second session gave notice of motion \u2014 \" That an humble address be presented to the Queen, praying that Her Majesty will be graciously pleased to direct that the requisite steps be taken for the speedy and entire separation of the District of Port Phillip from the territory of New South Wales, and its erection into a separate and independent colony.\" This motion came on for discussion on Tuesday, the 20th of August, 1844; and Dr. Lang addressed the House in a very long and unmistakably able speech. He recalled the early history of the settlement, and remarked that no one could ever have dreamt that so energetic, so capable, so self-reliant a community would have been tacked on to another six hundred miles away. Port Phillip was no offshoot from New South Wales ; and it was by a merely temporary arrangement that Sir Richard Bourke had assumed the control of it during its infancy. The arrival of men of means, education, and talent from the old country during the past four years had given the community an abundant claim to that independence which had from the beginning been contemplated. The land revenue of Port Phillip for the six years ending 31st December, 1842, had been \u00a3393,000, of which not more than \u00a3204,000 had been expended on immigration to the district. The balance was not used for any of the public works of the district, which were fully provided for by the ordinary local revenue ; it was all absorbed by the treasury at Sydney. Mr. J. P. Robinson, the member recently elected for Melbourne in place of Air. Condell, seconded the motion, and said that the very evident wishes of the people of Port Phillip should be consulted in this matter, and that he, for one, considered himself by no means capable of justly representing the community which had done him the honour of electing him. Air. Robert Lowe commenced that public career which eventually led him to the Chancellorship of the Exchequer in England by a brilliant speech in support of the motion, in which he said that a due consideration for truth and justice ought to lead the colony of New South Wales to grant without difficulty the proposed separation of a community which ardently desired it, and which had from the first been encouraged to hope for it. The opponents of the motion added little or nothing to the discussion. All the Sydney members, with the exception of Mr. Lowe, were fully resolved to vote against it, and the oratorical talent just displayed was wholly lost on them. When the votes were taken all the nominees but one, and all the Sydney members present, voted with the \" noes,\" who were nineteen in number. The five Port Phillip members, though residents of Sydney, voted with the \" ayes,\" to whom was added Robert Lowe, though a nominee member. The motion was thus lost, and a week later Mr. Lowe resigned his nominee position, to be returned by election not long after to the same council. Dr. Lang had lost his motion, but that only stirred up his combative qualities. He wrote to the Separation Committee in Alelbournc to keep up the agitation by every means in its"], [307, "SEPARATION FROM NEW SOUTH WALES. -1840 TO 1831. 285 power, and he himself drafted a petition for transmission to the Queen, and induced all the Port Phillip representatives to sign it. In this document, Her Alajesty was informed of the progress of Port Phillip ; of the misappropriation of the revenue ; of the ardent desire of its people for separation ; and of the complete state of preparation in which they were for the assumption of independence, without the necessity of any expense on the part of the Home Government. Towards the end of 1844 Mr. Edward Curr became the chairman of the Separation Committee in Melbourne, and under his busy zeal the matter was not suffered to rest in quietness- No fewer than four petitions were drafted by him in that year. The first was to the Legislative Council in Sydney, and was signed by 2194 inhabitants of Port Phillip, but was merely received in a formal way. The second was addressed to the House of Commons, and was presented to that body by one of its members. The third petition was from the people of the County of Bourke, and the fourth from the inhabitants of Geelong ; but all were equally the work of Air. Curr, who earned by his activity at that time the popular title of the \" Father of Separation.\" All this agitation could not but have its effect in England, and Lord Stanley seems to have had no wish to thwart the desires of the colonists in any way; but there were many interests involved. He therefore determined to refer the matter to the Executive Council at Sydney, indicating to Sir George Gipps, in clear enough manner, that his sympathy was now with the petitioners ; at first he had thought that the privilege of electing six members to the Legislative Council would have proved satisfactory ; but since that was a mistake, he desired the Executive Council to report as to the petition before steps should be taken to grant it. The Governor, therefore, called a meeting of the Executive, consisting of the Colonial Secretary, the Commander of the Forces, the Bishop of Australia, and the Colonial Treasurer. Various witnesses were examined, including the six members for Port Phillip, three of whom had, however, recently resigned on the ground that they could not adequately represent a district in which they had no interests, and of which they had but a scanty knowledge. The deliberations of the Executive occupied the early part of 1846, till, on the 1st of April, the matter came to the vote. The Colonial Secretary and the Commander of the Forces were in favour of granting separation ; the Bishop and the Treasurer were against it. The Governor gave his casting vote in favour of the measure, and transmitted to Lord Stanley the recommendation that separation should be granted. It was, therefore, now only a matter of a little time, and the colonists of Port Phillip were jubilant. In 1846 Dr. Lang came to Melbourne to gather information for a book upon which he was then engaged, with the title of Phillipsland. To the citizens he was the hero of the hour, and a grand separation banquet was tendered to him, \u2014 the first great public banquet of Alelbourne. It was held in the Queen's Theatre, of which the pit was boarded over, to make it level with the stage. Three hundred and fifty gentlemen took their seats at three long tables ; Air. Aloor, the second mayor of the city, took the chair. On his right sat the exultant Dr. Lang and Dr. Alacarthur. On his left Dr. Thomson and Henry Condell. They sat immediately under the dress circle, which was gaily decorated for the occasion, and over their heads was a painting by Opie of Prometheus bound to the rock, with a vulture gnawing at his liver, a subject supposed to have some allegorical allusion to the relations of Port Phillip and Sydney. And from the dress circle, over the picture and over the decorations, beamed the glad faces of the wives and daughters of the banqueters, who were drinking prosperity to the promised separation. Dr. Lang received a great ovation, and in replying to the toast of \"Dr. Lang and Separation,\" was compelled to ascend the table, whence he dealt to right and left a constant succession of jokes and telling points. lie was in his happiest humour, and the newspaper reports of his speech bristle with parenth-.se*, eel"], [308, "286 VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. \" protracted cheering\" and \" uproarious laughter.\" He referred to the money of Port Phillip as being wanted to cure a disease of the chest contracted in Sydney. He told his hearers that Sydney desired them to remember she was still but Botany Bay, and was but following an old instinct when she commanded them to \" stand and deliver.\" He described the simpleton who saw the great wheels of a carriage chasing the little ones, and vainly endeavouring to come up with them, and who called out, \" Well done little wheels !\" He assured his hearers that so would he call out \" well done little settlement\" if Port Phillip only obtained the separation it desired, for then would it soon make the bigger settlement the hind wheel in real earnest. After all his rough, but telling jokes, we can imagine the thunders of applause from the theatre full of people with good wine at their finger ends, loose boards beneath their feet, and a fervid cause to inspire them, in which they were unanimously zealous.6 But though they were thus felicitating themselves, there was a long time to elapse before their wishes should be truly realised. Ere the report of the Executive Council of Sydney could reach London, the Government had been defeated, and Lord Stanley had given up the control of the Colonial Office to Earl Grey, and this new Cabinet of Lord Russell's had on hand the potato famine, and Irish troubles, and chartism, and a dozen other complicated matters which must be dealt with. No wonder, therefore, that a year later, in 1847, Earl Grey wrote to Sir Charles Fitzroy, who, in the meantime, had succeeded Gipps, explaining that it was impossible to induce the House of Commons to consider the matter that year. He expressed his own conviction that local government should be conceded, and that the existing mode of representing Port Phillip in the Sydney Council was \" unreal and illusory.\"7 He stated that next year he proposed to bring a bill before Parliament for the creation of the new colony, to which, he believed, Her Majesty would be willing to give her own name. But the year 1848 was destined also to pass away without bringing the question to an issue ; and in that year the electors of Port Phillip were called on again to go through the mockery of an election of members to serve another period of five years. Only one resident of the district came forward to be nominated for Alelbourne \u2014 Mr. John F. L. Foster \u2014 his opponent being a Air. Boyd, of Sydney, a new arrival, unknown even by name in Melbourne. Mr. Foster was well respected, but a man of no eminence in the town, and the electors had no special desire to constitute him their representative. He was therefore persuaded to withdraw, and the electors agreed to abstain wholly from voting, and so to return no one. To Mr. Latrobe and the authorities this seemed a most objectionable proceeding, and they persuaded Air. Foster to carry out his first intention ; he was duly nominated, and though there had been only four or five electors intending to vote for him, yet if nobody else voted that would be sufficient to give him the seat. Those who wished the election to be void, as a protest against what they considered a sham, were in danger of losing the day, when Air. Thomas M'Combie proposed an ingenious expedient which in the end gave to the separation party a very great advantage. He nominated Earl Grey himself. A great deal of vigour was shown by both parties, and Mr. Foster's friends after all brought 102 votes to the poll, but the supporters of the non-electing principle were in a great majority, and polled 295 votes for Earl Grey, who, in spite of some protests, was declared by the returning officer to be duly elected. There was a great deal of animated discussion, and many meetings were held, at which Mr. Curr, and John O'Shanassy, and John Fawkner, and J. S. Johnston, and Captain Cole, and Colin Campbell, and Al'Combic, and Tort Phillip Herald, 12th February, 1S46. ; House of Commons Papers, 1850, IX. 42."], [309, "SEPARATION FROM NEW SOUTH WALES.\u2014 1840 TO 1851. 287 Duerdin, and others took part. But the election in the end was declared by the law officers to be valid. Latrobe was dismayed at the result. He considered this step as little else than an insult to Earl Grey \u2014 that head of the Colonial Office from whom he held his appointment. In his perturbation he wrote to Fitzroy, who communicated to Earl Grey the painful intelligence of this \" improper and unbecoming \" action of the people of Port Phillip. But their fears were groundless. Earl Grey took it in perfect good humour, and though a little joked about it in the House of Lords, he joined readily enough in the laugh. When Lord Monteagle \u2014 that Air. Spring-Rice who had once been himself Secretary for the Colonies \u2014 gravely asked the Minister in his place in the House if he knew who was the present member for Alelbourne, and what were his views, Earl Grey stated he had himself had the honour of being elected, but as he had not yet taken his seat he feared he would by that time have forfeited it. The Duke of Richmond asked him would he stand again, and Earl Grey replied with some banter. All this, though trifling enough in itself, was exactly of the nature to arrest the attention of a bus)- public assemblage, and in the end was of assistance to Port Phillip. The non-election party tried the same man\u0153uvre a second time, but failed in it. They had secured the election of Earl Grey for Alelbourne, but there were still five members to be returned for the district. The Government had been so much offended at the result of the previous election that they had transferred the polling-place from Alelbourne to Geelong. Thither went a committee of three, consisting of John Fawkner, J. S. Johnston, and Captain Cole, to watch the elections in the interests of the non-election part)-. But there were six candidates there \u2014 Lachlan M'Kinnon, James Williamson, John Dickson, Dr. James F. Palmer, Edward Curr, and Dr. William Macarthur. The committee therefore nominated six opponents \u2014 the Duke of Wellington, Lord Brougham, Lord John Russell, Lord Palmerston, and Sir Robert Peel. But the Portland and Port Fairy electors did not appreciate the tactics of the committee, and only a small minority of them voted for these distinguished candidates. Half of the voters refrained from voting, but that left the election entirely in the hands of about 240 out of 605 electors, and these returned five of the gentlemen first named. In 1849 the movement for separation began to take tangible shape in the councils of England. On the 4th of April in that year, when the Queen took her chair to preside over a meeting of the Privy Council in Buckingham Palace, the only business was the question of the separation of Victoria from New- South Wales. A long report was read from the Lords of the Committee of the Council, recommending the Queen and Parliament to grant the desired separation ; it was clear, they said, from the recent elections that the form of representation possessed by Port Phillip was of no value to it. They pointed out that former queens had given their names to colonies in America, and it would be a gratification to everyone if the Queen would consent to give her own name to this new and promising colony of Australia. The Lords of the Committee, however, desired to see some general provisions made for the better government of the Australian colonies ; they desired that each colony should have a Legislative Council of nominee and elected members, such as New South Wales then possessed; they would have preferred to recommend two separate Houses, one nominee, one elective, but the colonies seemed not yet ripe for so full a constitution. The}- trusted, however, that some one of the colonial Governors would have the title of Governor-General, and would be empowered at any time to call a federal council of all the colonies to adjust all matters relating to tariffs, posts, roads lighthouses, shipping dues, weights and measures, and to establish a general Supreme Court for the trial of appeal cases. The paper was very long, but Her Majesty signified her approval, and it was directed that a bill be prepared to embody these principles. 2 L Vol. I*"], [310, "queen Victoria in 1841. (After the painting by Sir W. Ross.)"], [311, "SEPARATION FROM NEW SOUTH WALES.\u2014 1840 TO 1851. 289 On the 4th of June following, this bill was introduced in the House of Commons by Air. Hawes, the Under-Secretary for the Colonies. Earl Grey had previously asked leave to bring it himself in the first place before the House of Lords, but the Commons were tenacious of their privilcges, and as there were references in it to taxation they refused to give their permission. Earl Grey therefore had to explain the principles of his measure through the mouth of his subor dinate, Mr. Hawes. It was a long bill, with many clauses and abundant provisos, but the four leading features in it were : \u2014 First, the separation of Port Phillip from New South Wales, and its elevation to the rank of a new colony, under the title of Victoria ; second, the granting of a constitution similar to that of New South Wales to the colonies of Victoria, Van Diemen's Land, and South Australia, and also to Western Australia when certain conditions should be complied with ; third, a provision for the alteration of this constitution whenever any of the colonies should feel so inclined, for it was intended that the constitution granted by the bill should be merely temporary \u2014 the house of twelve nominees and twenty-four elective members should simply carry on affairs until each colony should be able to decide for itself what was the peculiar form of constitution it most desired ; fourth, the provision for a federal council. Nothing more was said about a Governor-General, but the federal council was to appoint and control a Supreme Court, to manage a federal system of post-offices, to make such roads, canals, or railroads as traversed more than one colony, to superintend the erection of lighthouses, and arrange a uniform tariff. After Air. Hawes had moved leave to introduce this bill, Air. Gladstone rose, and, in a long and skilful speech, criticised some of its provisions. The franchise, he thought, was too restricted. This was a point that had long exercised the minds of the colonists. The man who owned real estate to the value of two hundred pounds, and he who rented a house for which he paid twenty pounds a year, had a vote for the elections to the Council. But the squatter came under neither of these clauses. He probably owned no land, and he did not pay twenty pounds a year as the rent of a dwelling, so he could not exercise the franchise. So early as July in 1843 the squatters of Port Phillip had met in the Royal Hotel and petitioned for the extension of the franchise ; other meetings of the same kind were held; their petitions were acknowledged by the Colonial Office as having been \" graciously received\" by Her Majesty, but there for some time the matter rested. When the new bill was brought forward the opinions of Governor Fitzroy and Superintendent Latrobe were asked as to the desirability of this extension, and great was the wrath of the Port Phillip settlers when it was discovered that Latrobe was antagonistic to their prayers, and hostile to the proposal to form a lower and more popular chamber of legislation. These causes had led to a bitter feeling against him among the squatters, and when, in 1848, he was found to have ridiculed in some of his despatches the favourite contention of the separation party, that the Port Phillip district was being robbed by the Sydney Government, their anger took the shape of a distinct effort to obtain his removal. A requisition signed by 700 residents of Melbourne called on the Mayor, Andrew Russell, to convene a meeting, and so many people were expected to attend that no hall in the town could hold them. They therefore gathered on a vacant piece of ground in Latrobe-street, about the site of the Alint, and in spite of the torrents of rain that fell three thousand men heard no less than seven speeches against the conservative disposition and the truckling subserviency of the Superintendent. An almost unanimous resolution was passed that a petition be sent to the Queen, praying for his removal. This petition also had been \" graciously received,\" but nothing further came of it. Latrobe's position was made very uneasy by it, but at that time he enjoyed the full confidence of his superiors, and in truth he had done nothing to draw down upon his head all the violent invectives of his opponents."], [312, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 290 Still the question of the franchise remained one of considerable soreness, and in January 1849 the squatters of the Geelong district made a new effort. They held a meeting one after noon, with Lachlan Mackinnon in the chair, and framed a petition praying that the franchise should be extended to lessees of Crown lands and to tenant farmers. Mr. Mackinnon forwarded this petition to Latrobe, who sent it to Fitzroy, who enclosed it in a despatch to Earl Grey, who laid it before the Queen, who \"graciously received it.\" But the squatters had likewise privately confided their woes to Mr. Gladstone, and he now became their champion. His first point of criticism therefore was that the bill made no provision for the extension of the franchise, though it was known that Governor Fitzroy had advised its extension to the whole body of squatters, whom he described as a singularly intelligent, careful, and industrious class of men, generally of ample education. Air. Gladstone next objected to the one chamber system of legislature ; and, lastly, denounced the proposal to give to a federal council the power to frame a uniform tariff. In so vast a range of climates, he said, a uniform tariff would be impossible, and would only raise prejudices and animosities in the minds of colonists whose interests were in conflict. Lord John Russell replied somewhat happily to these contentions, and leave was granted that Mr. Hawes, Lord John Russell, and Mr. Labouchere should introduce the bill, which was done on nth June 1849, and the first reading permitted to pass without debate. But the Government had been shaken by the criticisms of Mr. Gladstone as to the imposi tion of a uniform tariff. A week later they abandoned that part of their proposal, and moved for leave to bring in a new bill, the same in substance as the previous one, but with all reference to tariff omitted. This was read a first time on 26th June 1849, but a week later another blow was struck, when Lord Monteagle (Mr. Spring-Rice) read in the House of Lords a petition from the mayor and inhabitants of Sydney against the franchise regulations of the bill. The petition, he said, was signed by Mr. Robert Lowe, a gentleman whose talents and character caused his opinion to have much weight. He therefore demanded that the Government should defer this bill till the wishes of the colonists on all points of it were fully known. Earl Grey said that there was no finality in these proposed constitutions. They would do very well for a time, and so soon as the colonies were set upon an independent footing each could please itself as to the constitution it would choose, subject to no restriction but Her Majesty's consent. He urged upon Parliament the necessity of dealing at once with this measure, so long delayed. Lord Stanley then proposed that a short bill should at once be passed for the separation of Port Phillip, a point upon which they were all unanimous, but that, as the session was drawing to a close, all the other matters might be left over till next year. At this stage the subject was allowed to drop, as the bill was not yet properly before the House of Lords; but a fortnight later Lord Stanley made a second ineffectual effort to have the separation of Port Phillip carried at once without waiting for the discussion of the other provisions of the bill. It was already three years since he had given that district full hopes of a speedy settlement, and he was jealous of his own personal honour in the matter. It was not till the next session, on 1 8th February 1850, that the new bill reached the stage of a second reading, when a long and interesting debate occurred. Lord John Russell led off with a speech which occupies thirty-two columns of Hansard. He traced from its commencement the colonial history of England ; described the loss of the American colonies ; advised the House to remember that this was the turning point of England's colonial policy ; that the creation of a number of separate communities, all managing their own affairs under the direction of their own legislatures, and only under a nominal control of the Crown, would"], [313, "SEPARATION FROM NEW SOUTH WALES.\u2014 1840 TO 1851. 291 be an experiment such as the world had not yet seen, but such as augured well for the stability of the empire, inasmuch as it would secure the contentment of the colonists and assist in their progress. He concluded by moving \u2014 \"That better provision be made for the government of the Australian Colonies,\" and the House went into committee accordingly. The debate which follows occupies forty-five columns of Hansard, and the principal speakers were Air. Gladstone, Mr. Roebuck, and Sir W. Molesworth. When the House adjourned, in the small hours of that inclement February morning, and the members moved homeward through the slush of melting snow, they must have felt that underlying the comparatively simple provisions of a very formal looking bill there lurked a momentous principle which would have much to do with the future history of England's colonial empire. These Austral lands, then bathed in the warm sunshine of a February afternoon, were no longer to be infants fed, as it were, by a long spoon handled by the Colonial Office in London. They were to step out on the arena of nations, as buxom lads and lasses, with a golden suture all before them. The House, on many subsequent evenings, settled down to the discussion of details with assiduity. Mr. Scott made an elaborate attack on the principle of providing nominee members for the legislature ; Air. Labouchere replied ; Air. Roebuck, in a somewhat violent speech, attacked the whole system of the constitution proposed, and desired the creation of a body of nobility in the colonies, so that two houses \u2014 one of Lords and one of Commons \u2014 could be instituted, and the constitution so made to approximate to that of England. Then the venerable reformer, Joseph Hume, still full of fire, though bowed with years, rose to urge the speedy passing of the bill, for errors in detail could be easily rectified at a subsequent date ; and Air. Monckton- Milnes, in an eloquent speech, made the same request, and expressed his warm gratification that the Government had framed so generous a measure, which certainly introduced a new era in the history of colonisation. A score of speakers followed. On 22nd Alarch the House went into committee to discuss the question as to whether the colonies should have two chambers each in their legislatures. The debate was carried on till midnight, and then Mr. Gladstone rose and spoke for about an hour. He wished to see a complete constitution of the English type assigned to each colony; but the Government were firm in their idea of allowing each colony to suit itself after it had been set fairly going as an independent community; and it carried its way, the division, far on towards daylight, giving them 198 votes against 147. Many long and interesting, but always good-tempered debates filled up the months of March and April, till at last the bill reached its final stage, and was passed on the 13th of May, Mr. Gladstone again dealing eloquently with some of its minor details in a speech which occupies fifteen columns. The House of Commons could then proceed to the dubious consideration of the bill that embodied that startling proposal of Prince Albert's for a great international exhibition, while the Australian Colonies Bill was sent forward to the House of Lords. There it was again elaborately discussed by Lord Brougham, Earl Grey, Lord Granville, Lord Monteagle, and others, but its troubles were over on 10th June, when it was finally passed, though stripped of all allusion to a federal council. On the 5th of August it received the mystic touch of the Royal sceptre, and from that moment the District of Port Phillip became the COLONY OF Victoria. The news reached Melbourne by the Lysander on the nth of November, 1850. Mr. Curr, the father of separation, then lay dying, and by a melancholy coincidence he breathed his last just as the community was commencing its rejoicings for the consummation of a struggle in"], [314, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 292 which he had been so ardent a participator. For four days there was observed a general holiday, and on the second night Melbourne was illuminated, if not brilliantly, at least very generally. An enormous heap of timber had been gathered in anticipation on the Flagstaff Hill, and thither the mayor walked in procession to fire it with all due solemnity; it added its blaze to the general effect, and answering bonfires crowned the distant suburban heights. Many festivities marked the gladness of the time \u2014 Separation Concerts, Separation Fancy Dress Balls, and Separation Races, kept the people busy in their holidays. The last day was reserved for a stately ceremony, the opening of the Prince's Bridge. It had been four years in building, but was at last completed, and on a lovely spring forenoon the procession formed with banners, and waggons gaily decorated, and horses tricked out with ribbons ; the trades were there in little groups, and the societies, the officials, the military, defiled across the bridge thus first opened for traffic ; and so over to the grassy knoll called Emerald Hill, where athletic sports and games were celebrated to mark the close of the public rejoicings. But there were many formalities to be completed ere the colon}' could be an actually separate State. The English Act of Parliament had left to the Legislative Council at Sydney the duty of arranging the details for the new legislature of Victoria, only stipulating that one third of the members should be nominees. The manner in which the Legislative Council completed this task gave some offence in Alelbourne. It was decided that there should be ten nominee and twenty elective members. Melbourne, with a population of 23,000 out of a total of 77,000 in the colony at that time, was entitled to six members ; no more than three were assigned to it. Geelong, with 8000, received two members, or exactly its fair proportion. Portland, with IOOO ; Belfast, with the same number ; and Warrnambool, with 383, had one member for a total of 2372 persons. This latter proportion, if applied to Melbourne, would have given it ten members instead of three, and its citizens, ever fiery and inclined to be suspicious of the Sydney Council, regarded the arrangement as being intended as a sort of punishment for their agitation. An indignant meeting was held in the hall of the Mechanics' Institute. Dr. Palmer, Dr. Alacarthur, J. S. Johnston, John O'Shanassy, John Fawkner, Thomas M'Combie, William Westgarth, Alajor Alercer and others addressed it, and a resolution was passed which declared that on the basis of its population the country should be divided into twenty equal parts and a member assigned to each portion, an arrangement which would have given Alelbourne six. But the Council in Sydney would not yield. They assigned the members according to their own plan, giving three members for Melbourne, two for Geelong, one for Portland, Belfast and Warrnambool; one for Kilmore, Kyneton and Seymour; two for County Bourke, one for County Grant; one for Normanby, Dundas, and Follett; one for Villiers and Heytesbury; one for Ripon and Hampden; one for Grenville and Polwarth; one for Talbot, Dalhousie and Anglesey; one for Evelyn and Mornington; and one for Gippsland. The three remaining seats were reserved for districts which, so far, were solely squatting settlements \u2014 one for the Murray district, one for the Loddon district, and one for the Wimmera district. The Act of Parliament had chosen the Murray as the northern boundary of Victoria ; Dr Lang now made another effort to induce New South Wales to carry the bounds of the new colony as far north as the Murrumbidgee, but his eloquence and his diplomacy were alike without avail. There was also some discussion as to the western boundary. In the early days of the colony the inhabitants of the Portland Bay district had made some little talk of moving for separation and forming another new colony ; but, with better roads and more rapid mails, they had forgotten that idea, and now they would have liked to see the western boundary carried out as"], [315, "SEPARATION FROM NEW SOUTH WALES.\u2014 1*40 TO 1831. 293 far as the mouth of the Murray, so that that river, from its source to the sea, should form the northern boundary of the colony. But the bounds remained as fixed by the English Parliament and the electoral districts as determined by the Sydney Council. The actual independence of Victoria was dated from the 1st of July, 185 1, when the writs were issued for the elections of the first Victorian Council. Mr. Latrobe was sworn in on the 15th of July as Lieutenant-Governor. Taking his station on the steps of the Government offices, at the foot of William-street, he listened to Captain Lonsdale, who read the commission in public ; he took the prescribed oath, a salute was fired, and from \" His Honour\" he had become \" His Excellency.\" The colonists were generally pleased, the little troubles of the past were blown over, the people had obtained their wishes, and could afford to be magnanimous, and they could scarcely fail to remark that in the heat of the conflict they had been more or less unjust to the Superintendent, whom they had accused of acting deceitfully. They must now in cooler moments have allowed that, though sometimes weak, and often undecided \u2014 though much more able in the drafting of a despatch than in the practical management of actual business \u2014 yet he was a man of a high and ideal sense of honour. On that same day he issued a Gazette containing the names of our first responsible officials. Captain Lonsdale was made Colonial Secretary, while Alastair M'Kenzie became Colonial Treasurer; C. H. Ebden was our first Auditor-General, and William Foster Stawell our first Attorney-General; Redmond Barry became Solicitor-General, and H. F. Gurner Crown Solicitor ; Robert Hoddle was made Surveyor-General, Alexander M'Crae Postmaster-General, and James Simpson was made the Sheriff. The elections were completed on the 1st of October, and among the twenty who were returned occur the names of John Fawkner, John Thomas Smith, Henry Miller, Dr. James Palmer, Francis Murphy, William Rutledge, and Peter Snodgrass. Alelbourne returned John O'Shanassy, J. S. Johnston, and William Westgarth. Latrobe appointed his ten nominees \u2014 five official : Stawell, Lonsdale, Ebden, Barry, and Pohlman ; and five non-official, that proportion being required by the Act. The first meeting of the new Council was held on nth November when Dr. Palmer was chosen to be its Speaker; but the business transacted in that first session was only formal or financial. It was only to a certain extent a satisfaction of the wishes of the community, this Council one-third nominee, and two-thirds elected by a decidedly limited body of electors. Only those who had \u00a3100 worth of real estate, or who were the occupants of houses of the annual value of ten pounds, were possessed of the right to vote; but it was as free a constitution as most communities in those days could boast, and it was to be only temporary, so that there was little to alloy the general content, and the community might have settled down to a period of quiet prosperity and steady-moving progress, but that as soon as the separation agitation was completed, there was precipitated upon it the excitement, the mad prosperity, the intoxicating bounds of progress of the gold discovery. It was but sixteen years since Batman had wandered over a silent land; it was but fourteen years since the first allotment had been sold; and now the community of 77,000 persons formed a little state, independent and autonomous; it had its flourishing capital of 23,000 persons, and another handsome town of 8000; but it was a com munity that was of its own class, a community where all were industrious, and hard work was the everywhere prevalent feature. Yet already there was no other community in the world that could exhibit the same general average of prosperity ; though no one could afford to live in the leisure of even moderate competency, yet everyone had the means of filling his home and his"], [316, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 294 daily life with a degree of comfort that even favoured America could not equal, nor any of the colonies, save perhaps South Australia alone. When 1851 began, there was every prospect that Victoria would continue to develop her pastoral resources, and add to them those of agriculture, and form a little nation, a pattern of good order and industry and solid growth, when on a sudden in rushed the flood of fortune-seekers on its quiet seclusion, and in a twelvemonth all was changed.

Robertson, 1883)."], [317, "CHAPTER XVII. Zhe of (Mb.\u2014 185 1. SWffiT was a notable epoch in the financial history of the world, that autumn morning of | September 1847, when on the banks of the Sacramento Captain Suttor commenced his >-nt5; mill-race for the new saw-mill he was erecting. Almost the first shrub that was pulled up out of the silent wilderness revealed a shining treasure at its roots, and a little search gave ample stores of gold. The news went forth. The township of San Francisco poured out its population to stir the soil for miles around. A hundred thousand people came from afar to join the crowd of fortune seekers. The total gold supply of the world before that date had been but four or five millions per annum ; now in California alone the yield was about thirteen millions, and the finances of the world were permanently put upon a new footing. But while the crowds of adventurous gold-seekers were pouring from every part of the habitable earth, to toil by the banks of the Sacramento, how could Australia escape the fever? Her inhabitants were more characterised than most others by a love of change and an inclination for adventure. An exodus therefore began which threatened speedily to undo the benefits of all that expensive immigration which had been carried out but a year or two before. In 1848, 1849, and 1850, several thousands left each year; in the latter year Melbourne saw the spectacle \u2014 a son-)' one for it \u2014 of five vessels lying together at her piers loading with passengers for California. It was natural, therefore, that many thoughts should turn to the possibility of finding that precious magnet in Australia, and people began to notice various prognostications which had been made. Strzelecki had in 1840 reported the discovery of traces of gold in ores obtained among the mountains ; and the Rev. W. B. Clarke, one of the Chaplains of New South Wales, and a zealous amateur geologist, had in 1841 stated in print his reasons for supposing that Australia would be found auriferous. His arguments were by no means of a cogent character, being mostly in the nature of analogies, which the state of geologic science at that time did not render convincing. In 1844 the specimens taken to England by Strzelecki Vol. I. 2 M"], [318, "296 VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. had formed the basis of a paper read by Sir Roderick Murchison before the Royal Geographical Society. In that contribution he remarked the similarity between the Urals and the Dividing Range of New South Wales, and as the Ural Mountains were then the source of half the gold in the world, he hazarded the speculation that this metal would probably be found in Australia ; in 1848 a gentleman named Smith gratified him by forwarding a piece of gold enveloped in quartz, which had been procured in these very mountains. However, all these had been regarded very much in the light of scientific facts, useful to put in text books, but not affecting the great world as it rolled on from day to day occupied in its daily tasks. But the news from California, with the stories of splendid fortunes realised by unskilled labourers in a week or two, put a practical point on these theories that the least scientific readers could understand, and the desertion of the colony by men in crowds made it a matter of extreme practical importance to follow up these speculations and determine their truth. Many a shepherd varied the monotony of his lonely existence by poking up the earth of the streams around his hut, in the hopes of repeating in Australia the lucky experience of Marshall in California; and some of them came very near to finding what they sought for. One of them brought down to Melbourne in January 1849 a secret specimen he wished to be tested. He submitted it to Mr. Richardson, the dentist of the town, who examined the metal that specked the creamy quartz. It was gold, and in such quantity that if there was much of the same stone to be had, California would soon have a rival. The shepherd, a slow and illiterate fellow, took his precious specimen over to Brentani's, then the chief jeweller's shop in Melbourne. There a proper assay was made, and the dilapidated shepherd, who gave the name of Chapman, was taken into Brentani's house to lodge until a party could secretly be organised for the purpose of proceeding to the district; they set off in a dray, which it is said' they proposed to load with gold before they came back. The story of their expedition is shrouded in mystery. Chapman disappeared, and came no more before the public. Brentani and his assistants found two pieces of gold, valued together at more than a hundred pounds; but probably laboured long and hard without finding more, and were dissatisfied with the return yielded for the time expended. They seem to have hit upon a spot between two places that afterwards were famous goldfields, but failing to secure any startling results returned to their ordinary avocations in Collins-street, and forgot their day-dreams. Other similar attempts, all futile, occurred both in New South Wales and Victoria, but at last there appeared early in 185 1 the man who was to make the discovery of gold a practical success. Edward Hammond Hargraves was by education an Australian. Born at Gosford in England, he arrived in the colony when a boy, and passed his youth near Bathurst. On striking out for himself he tried a farm at Illawarra, and then at Broken Bay, but finally settled on a small cattle station of his own on the Manning River, where he married and gathered round him a little family. For a while the business went well, but 1847 and 1848 were years of drought in the north of New South Wales, and the price of stock fell very sadly. When the anxious Hargraves carried to market the seventy cattle whose sale was to make his year's income, and when he saw them disposed of for one pound each, he went home in disgust, and said he would try the diggings in California. So leaving wife and children on the station, he made one of the stream that was setting in towards San Francisco, and found upon the tent-covered 1 M'Combie, p. 210."], [319, "THE DISCOVERY OF GOLD.\u2014 1831. 297 slopes of the Sacramento a party of eight Australians, whom he joined. They soon learnt the mysteries of pan-washing, and when they had earned a few pounds, bought a \"cradle\" and a tent. But the work was hard, and as theirs was not a lucky patch, the proceeds were small ; and a North American winter came upon them with terrible severity. Thoughts of more genial days in Australia filled his mind, and he had a notion of returning. He fancied that the aspect of the valley where they had wintered was very much like that of a gully he had seen somewhere among the Blue Mountains in his earlier days. He at last recalled the place ; the silent bed of a little stream some miles from Bathurst. It was fifteen years since he had seen it, but it floated like a vision before his eyes, and it was similar \u2014 ver)- similar \u2014 to the scene that lay around him. The more he dreamt of it the more vividly he seemed to see the gold in the bed of that Summerhill Creek; a fortune, only waiting the arrival of some one who should have acquired, as he had done, a little knowledge of the gold-digger's art. So, as soon as spring had made the roads passable, he returned to San Francisco, disconsolate, but with a secret corner in his breast where he nursed a cheering hope. In January 185 1 he landed in Sydney, and succeeded in borrowing a few pounds for the venture he was meditating. He got a horse and took his lonely way across the Blue Mountains ; on the third night he lodged at the Guyong Inn, not far from the Summerhill Creek. But he had grown doubtful of his ability to find his way after all these years of absence, and the landlady agreed that her son, a lad of fifteen or sixteen, should be his guide next morning. And so, in the cool of the day, ere the fierce glare of that 12th of February could harass them on their way, they sallied forth on horseback on that expedition so memorable for Australia. They struck at once into the sombre forest, with the fresh gum scent wafted past their faces by the breath of dawn, and ere the day was up they were down in the bed of the Lewis Ponds Creek, which they were to follow to its junction with the Summerhill. The sharp cone-like hills that rose abruptly on either hand caused the actual course of the stream to be the easiest means of travelling, though it was much encumbered by fallen trees; and their ride of fifteen miles was one of slow progress. The blazing mid-day was past when they reached the junction of the streams that valley which had floated for so many months before his eyes. It was not altogether what he had thought it, and yet the likeness to the Californian scenery was sufficiently striking, and he scarcely could sit in peace to eat a little of the lunch the lad had brought, so eager was he to find a good place for commencing upon. It was a valley of two or three hundred yards in width, the level part a sandy river-bed, bordered by flats that once had been a river-bed, but now were grassy with yellow dried-up grass. On either hand rose the precipitous cliffs of clay slate, intermingled with quartz, and lifting their bold escarpments four"], [320, "298 VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. hundred sect up into the blue air. All the aspect of the country was poor-looking and barren, but there, just below the junction of the streams, was a natural dam, a sort of alluvial bank, a quarter of a mile in length, where the two currents had for years agreed to deposit the sand they had brought clown from the hills in their first impetuous rush. That was the place for gold to gather in, and Hargraves unstrapped his trowel and his tin pan. A little of the sand and red clay was soon washed out, and to the boy's eyes, as they eagerly peered in, there became visible a couple of specks like yellow pin-heads glittering in the corner. Five more attempts were made in various parts, and four times did gold appear. A long and exciting day was spent in various trials up and down the stream, and all with results which showed that gold was more uniformly distributed there than Hargraves had found it in California, though he failed to light upon any startling deposit. But he considered his success practically assured and that evening, at his late supper in the inn, he could not refrain, in the exultation of his heart, from prophecies to which the cautious inmates listened with most doubtful ears. However, he was in no especial hurry, and resolved upon a wide, yet careful search. All the rest of February and the whole of March were spent in exploring the district. The united waters of the Summerhill Creek and the Lewis Ponds flow into the Macquarie, and a large tributary, the Turon, joins that river on the northern side. All the upper courses of these streams, and the various headwaters of the Macquarie, were examined. Hargraves, with his former guide, and another lad who had joined him, traced the courses of the streams, and tested the soil from mile to mile, till he was assured that gold was uniformly present in the beds of all the creeks over a distance of at least a hundred miles. Leaving his two lads to visit a place on the Turon, where it was said an old shepherd named Macgregor had once seen a piece of auriferous quartz, he himself turned westward down the Macquarie to the neighbourhood of Dubbo, and after several days of examination, in which he found gold still uniformly but thinly distributed, returned to find that the lads had secured ten or twelve pounds worth of gold on the Turon for half a week's work. Hargraves now began to fear that any further delay would leave him open to the possibility of being forestalled, and he started on his homeward journey to Sydney, leaving the boys still busy. On arriving in the city he obtained an interview with Deas Thompson, the Colonial Secretary, and offered, for a suitable reward, to point out a locality that would prove a rich goldfield. The matter was referred to Governor Fitzroy, who replied that no such bargain could be made, but that if the discoverer chose to reveal the spot, and it proved to be what he anticipated, a suitable reward would then be given to him in proportion to the magnitude of the result.\"' On 3rd April Hargraves wrote asking for at least \u00a3500 as a preliminary, but the Governor refused, suspecting the possibility of a hoax. After a long delay, on 30th April Hargraves wrote' accepting the terms that were proposed. Now, it had so happened that the Government had just imported a geologist. For Fitzroy, alarmed at the exodus of people from the colony, and instigated by the prophecies of Strzelecki, Clarke, and Murchison, and moved to action by frequent rumours of gold discovery, had written requesting the Colonial Office to send out a good geologist, so that a thoroughly scientific search might be made at the expense of the colony. Mr. S. Stutchbury had accordingly been sent out. He had been in '-'\"Tales of the Goldfields,\" by George Sutherland; also \"Australia and its Goldfields,\" by Edward Hammond Hargraves. The story is also in part compiled from details derived from the discoverer himself. All the correspondence will be found in the House of Commons papers, printed 1852."], [321, "THE DISCOVERY OF GOLD.-1831. 299 the colony a month or two, and had commenced his work, but as yet he had discovered nothing of importance. To him was assigned the duty of accompanying Hargraves, and reporting as to the value of his discovery. A letter was forwarded to him among the mountains, directing him to proceed to Bathurst, and there meet the practical digger. But Hargraves was there before him, and as the rumour of his discovery had spread, there was some excitement in the little town. The editor of the local paper gathered a meeting in a small hall, and Hargraves addressed about sixty people. He assured them that in their own district a second California was lying asleep, and it wanted only a few taps of pick and shovel to wake it to life. He was met by a good deal of banter and nonsense, and, like the prophet in Galilee, had little honour in his own country. But, over night, a few of his audience thought better of the matter, and in the morning a party of nearly thirty volunteered to accompany him if he would lead. They were all mounted, and after a wild scamper, they reached the promised spot, each with the most suitable tin dish he had been able to find in his kitchen at home. They set to work, at first in jocular humour, but when the golden specks began to appear in the corner of each tin dish, a grim and earnest silence settled down ; and they had it \u2014 they were smitten \u2014 -that strange gold fever had worked its sudden infection, which they were to spread over the length and breadth of Australia, and thence to the uttermost parts of the world. On the 8th of May Mr. Stutchbury arrived, and three hours later sent to Governor Fitzroy a preliminary memorandum stating that gold was there most assuredly, but whether in remunerative quantity remained to be seen. A day or two later that point was settled ; each man, with only a spade and a milk-pan, was securing on an average an ounce a day. That made a return of between eighteen and twenty pounds a week ; and as unskilled labour was then worth no more than thirty shillings per week, it is not surprising that the labouring classes, and even those of a superior grade, deserted their occupations through all the neighbouring districts and made their way to the Summerhill Creek. On 19th May, about a week later, there were four hundred people in the bed of the creek, occupying that alluvial bank which lay at the confluence of the streams. There they stood from early morn till the sun set at six o'clock, stooping all day in two rows about a mile long on either side of the current, working their tin-dishes with that circular motion which was to dissolve out the clay and leave the lumps ; then bending down to dip their vessels in the current, and see the muddy water washed away, till after repeated washings the grains lay thick in the corner. Some preferred the more speculative but less laborious task of picking out little nuggets, often of about the weight of a sovereign ; sometimes that species of industry procured a rich result ; sometimes a day of searching yielded nothing after all. A single lump of gold being sold in Bathurst for thirty pounds by a labouring man, completed the excitement; and on 25th May Stutchbury reported that a thousand persons were on the diggings. Most of these camped out at night, but a few tents began to appear on the slopes. It was a most orderly scene ; the gold was well distributed ; there were no quarrels ; every man, though excited, was in silent earnest, yet when Sunday came they all ceased, and the majority gathered to hear a sermon from the Rev. Mr. Chapman, a Wesleyan, who rode over for the purpose of holding divine service. But it was not known how long this good order would last, and Governor Fitzroy appointed John Richard Hardy to be crown commissioner for the goldfields. A proclamation was issued, asserting that the ownership of minerals found upon unalienated land was vested in the Crown ; but a second proclamation notified that the Government would issue licenses authorising persons to dig for and remove gold from Crown lands on"], [322, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 300 payment of thirty shillings each, such licenses to be renewed monthly. Mr. Hardy, on 3rd June, began the issue of licenses, and about 200 were taken out each day for a time. There were then 2000 people on the diggings. But the excitement received a check on 31st May, when torrents of rain began to descend. Many of the recent comers had the disappointment to find the soil already exhausted; ten or twelve thousand pounds worth of gold had been extracted from that patch which Hargraves had first examined, and beyond that space there was no more to be made than about ten shillings a-day, and that by severe toil, quite unsuited for the old and those not robust in body. Damped, therefore, in their hopes by day, and very much damped in their bodies when they had to lie out at night, with no shelter but the rocks, under a pitiless drizzle, a great number took the homeward road, and a counter current began. Mr. Hardy estimated that about five hundred came each week, but about two hundred left ; and the silent bush had grown a noisy place, where an unmade track had become a yard deep in mud, through which drays now began to plunge with flour and provisions for the diggers. A few enterprising people had gone out to the scene of all this excitement and erected wooden places for stores, and others had taken up tents for sale to the diggers, so the little town of Ophir grew up on the spot, and became the centre of widespread curiosity throughout Australia. From Melbourne, both by sea and overland, a tide of workingmen began to flow, and it is reported in the newspapers of the 31st May that neither in Melbourne nor in Geelong could a spade be bought, all having been carried off to Bathurst. At a meeting of the Executive Council, held on 3rd June, a sum of five hundred pounds was voted to Hargraves for his services, and Fitzroy stated his intention of increasing that sum to five thousand pounds ; but for that purpose he must ask the permission of the Colonial Minister in London. Meantime, Hargraves was appointed a gold commissioner at \u00a3\\ per day, with allowances for two horses, his business being to look for fresh goldfields. But he had already indicated a wide enough area, and on one of the places he had mentioned in that wide open valley wherein the Turon flows upon its broad bed of sand, a crowd of miners were gathering. On 19th June the commissioner reported that grain gold was there distributed, in perfect regularity, so that any able-bodied man could be sure of ten shillings per day, but that one pound per day was the average. Hence the movement of the labouring classes to that district became continuous ; the commissioner reported that at times no less than from twenty to thirty bullock teams could be counted in a row splashing along the wintry roads. The district had about four thousand diggers in it, and the yield became so great that the Government found it necessary to establish a gold escort. Each week a van with about .\u00a312,000 worth of gold started from Bathurst, and on either side a file of troopers, with jingling scabbards, galloped along the road for its protection. In Melbourne, the prospect was one of dismay. The universal talk among the labouring classes was that when the winter was over, and the rainy season past, they too would take the road for Ophir; or perhaps that for Sofala, as the two clusters of tents on the Turon were called. Victoria in a month more would be an independent colony, but what would that avail if her people should leave by thousands immediately after. She must have a goldfield of her own ; and the* rumours that had been afloat made people hope that one might easily be discovered. A public meeting was called on the 9th June, 185 1, and that useful hall of the Mechanics' Institute, in Collins-street, again contained an anxious crowd of citizens. After a long discussion it was decided to offer a reward of \u00a3 200 to anyone who should disclose the situation of a profitable goldfield not more than two hundred miles away from Melbourne. A committee"], [323, "THE DISCOVERY OF GOLD.\u2014 iS 51 301 was appointed to gather subscriptions and receive applications ; among other names occur those of John Fawkner, Andrew Russell, William Westgarth, John O'Shanassy, Thomas M'Combie, and Dr. Greeves. But this stimulus was scarcely needed. Men's minds were already sufficiently on fire, and even then the ranges were being scoured by seekers after fortune. One of the most notable was Dr. Bruhn, a German geologist, who had in fact begun his peregrinations in the beginning of the year, before even the advent of Hargraves. He was very poor, a refugee from the political storms of the old world. Up and down he wandered, asking to be informed where anybody had seen a white stone called quartz ; riding on his sorry pony out into all the wilds whereto he was directed on his wild-goose chase ; suffering much from having to sleep out under the stars, or worse still under the rain-clouds in his lonely nights ; half-starved, but filled with enthusiasm, and hopeful that in that scenery gold must somewhere occur. The discovery of Hargraves gave him fresh heart, and with all-devouring excitement he wore out that poor frame of his, and his dumb companion, in toilsome days among the Pyrenees and the Jim Crow Ranges. In May 185 1, while the rush was beginning to the Ophir diggings, he found a rich piece of quartz such as nowadays would be prized, but in those days, when stamping machines and crushing rollers and a great quantity of complicated machinery would have been wanted, the discovery was thought of but little value.' In June he was busy in the ranges beyond Buninyong, and inquiring of the squatters and their shepherds if they had seen quartz in the neighbourhood. He was told that on the station of Donald Cameron, called \"The Clunes,\" there had been discovered a piece of gold bearing quartz more than a year and a-half before. On making further inquiries he found it was even so. Mr. William Campbell, of Strathloddon, at the beginning of 1850 had picked up a handsome lump of auriferous quartz ; he had shown it to Donald Cameron, and also to his friends, Mr. Graham and Captain M'Lachlan. But as these were all in the squatting interest they agreed that it would be better to let the matter drop. It would ruin the country for sheep, they said, if swarms of diggers came up to the place, and they were likewise of opinion that little good resulted to the working-classes, who were drawn from regular avocations to follow the will-o'-the-wisp attractions of gold-mining. But Dr. Bruhn got indications enough to know where to look, and there, sure enough, not half-a-mile away from Donald Cameron's house, the auriferous quartz was to be seen in abundance. Just then there came the news of the reward offered for the discovery of a goldfield, and Dr. Bruhn forwarded a fine specimen of stone. It was analysed by Mr. Hood, the chemist, of Collins-street, who said that gold was certainly there, and in considerable quantity, but that, with the appliances then in the colony, such stone could not be profitably worked. This report was made in the first week in July, and was adverse to Dr. Bruhn's claim. Just then there occurred the most sensational discovery of gold the world had yet heard of. Dr. Kerr was a squatter near Bathurst. On the 8th of July, 185 1, he was seated at dinner with his family, when an aboriginal, employed as a shepherd on the station, burst into the room without ceremony, his eyes sparkling with excitement. He shouted, \" White fellow pick him up little fellow, me see him big fellow.\" This enigmatical announcement was followed by an explanation a little more lucid, from which Dr. Kerr imagined that the man was labouring under a delusion ; but as he was very much in earnest, Dr. Kerr left the table and got out his horse to accompany his excited informant. The)- travelled for eight miles, when the black ' Evidence of Royal Commission on Gold Discovery."], [324, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 302 reined up and threw himself from his horse. He ran to a place where the weather-stained quartz had been broken off with the back of a tomahawk, revealing the white stone within, and there, in the midst, lay a mass of gold of the size of a man's head. Dr. Kerr was beside it in an instant, and after some work detached the mass, but with so much quartz embedded that the whole weighed about three hundred-weight. A vehicle was soon brought, but they could not lift so great a mass into it, and Dr. Kerr therefore chopped it into three parts, destroying the look of the specimen, which had been very lovely when imbedded in its milky matrix. What was the excitement in Bathurst next morning when a trap drove up to the door of the Union Bank, drawn by two greys driven tandem, and a man was seen staggering under a load of 75 lbs. of gold, and two other pieces, broken from the same mass, were seen to follow. When the gold was melted down and the quartz rejected there was left a total of 106 lbs. of gold, valued at about four thousand pounds. The local papers chronicle \" Bathurst is mad again.\" But there were other places besides Bathurst that went mad. Melbourne had a violent relapse of the gold fever. A committee of the City Council had been arranging for the drainage of the streets, and their engineer, Mr. Blackburn, had just commenced upon a sanitary scheme that was to cure the place of its bad reputation for fevers. But this was a fever he had not reckoned upon, and in the inflammable material of Melbourne it spread with rapidity. The first rush was to the Plenty Ranges, but that was a mild excitement ; it was rumoured that someone, it was not known who, had seen gold-dust there, and in July a hundred men at least were scouring the slopes in hungry haste, each in desperate eagerness to anticipate his fellows in the discovery of the hundred-weight of gold that might, perchance, be lying somewhere about. But there was no such fortune in store for anybody, and though eventually the Caledonian diggings were opened in that district, they were not discovered till too late for the reward, and their reputation was always one of second-rate quality. How many others all over the colony were engaged in furtively tapping the rocks or panning out the clay of the valleys it is impossible to guess, but a favourite evening or holiday occupation of the Melbourne working-man was to scour the outlying districts in the same absorbing pursuit. Two of them at length were moderately successful. John Michel and William Habberton, sixteen miles from Melbourne, found grain gold in Anderson's Creek. That was on the 16th July ; they lost no time in proclaiming the discovery, and some members of the gold committee, together with Mr. Fenwick, the crown lands commissioner, and Mr. Walsh, the jeweller of Swanston-street, set out under their guidance for the goldfield. The news had spread, and forty eager men were there waiting to follow and strike for fortune. So the procession left Melbourne, through Richmond, out by the paddocks where now is Kew, and so through Doncaster to the creek, where fine grain gold was certainly obtained on panning out the mud which occupied the bed of the creek \u2014 the debris of those rocks of slate that formed the banks. This was the first payable goldfield opened. In a few days there were four hundred people there at work, and the district would have made a name for itself but that other much more lucrative fields were soon after discovered ; while at Anderson's Creek the best that could be said was that a hard-working man could make very reasonable wao-es there.5 But the men whose discoveries really set Victoria before the world as a gold-producing country were James Esmond and Thomas Hiscock. The former had been for several years the driver of the mail coach from Buninyong across the Pyrenees to Horsham, where a little inn then made the centre of a thinly-settled pastoral district. His hundred miles' drive each way once a \u25a0 Report of the Select Committee of the Legislative Council, on the claims for the discovery of gold."], [325, "THE DISCOVERY OF GOLD.\u2014 183 1. 303 week had made him well acquainted with the scenery. He had heard that there were rumours of gold having been discovered among these hills, but he had never seen any, nor had he ever heard that anything came of the discovery. But the world in 1849 was filled with the fame of California, and Esmond, like many another, threw up his situation to try his fortune there. But the richer claims had been mostly appropriated when he arrived. He found little gold, and was glad to take a situation as overseer for a man who had a really rich claim. After a year of drudgery he thought he would be happier in Australia, and, strangely enough, he sailed back to Sydney in the same vessel that carried Hargraves. He stayed for a month in Sydney, and in March 185 1 returned to his old district at Buninyong. But his seat on the mail coach was filled. There was nothing ready for him in the district which he cared to accept, and so to fill up time till something better should appear he took a contract to construct some fencing for a squatter, and employed a man named Pugh to assist him. It was a very lonely place \u2014 a green glade in the heart of the hills, where not a human face was seen from week to week. But at length there came a queer enthusiast on a broken-winded pony \u2014 Dr. Bruhn, with a few scientific implements strapped to his saddle. JAMES WILLIAM ESMO He talked a great deal about gold, and in his broken English told of the reward offered by a committee, and of the quartz discovered on the Clunes station by Mr. Campbell. Learning that Esmond had been in California, and knew something of the practical work of gold-finding, he advised him to try. The German enthusiast passed on his way, and the two mates talked the matter over at copious length between their pannikins of tea, the result being that they gave notice to their employer for the end of the month, and on the 6th of July set out on their memorable expedition. The forests had recently been sadly scorched by the fires of Black Thursday, but the hill-sides were green again at Clunes. There on the grassy slopes they saw the out-cropping quartz of which there had been so much talk, and after a little search they found a piece with those glittering specks whose attraction is so wonderful- Esmond's Californian experience now stood him in good stead. He knew to descend the stream a little way and to try for gold in the sands, but more especially in the clays of the river-bed. The first washing in their tin dish revealed the gold in moderate quantity. They spent the day in other trials, finding nothing startling, but always discovering gold, and when they got home to their tent, far on in the evening, they resolved to give the district a proper trial in Californian fashion. For that purpose a party was necessary. Esmond knew two decent fellows, sawyers, named Barnes and Kelly, resident at Burn bank, which was then the name of Lexton. He went over and persuaded them to join. The four men settled down for a couple of days and gathered about thirteen ounces of gold ; enough to give them each \u00a3$ per da)-. Then Esmond, leaving them at work, set off for Melbourne, to lodge an application, and obtain more suitable appliances. He took with him the gold that had been obtained, and left it with Mr. Patterson, an assayer of Geelong, to be tested. The latter, announcing it to be virgin gold, was curious to know where it had been obtained, but Esmond was naturally disinclined to impart any information at so early a date.\" He stipulated for a week's start in order that he might Esmond's evidence before Committee of Legislative Council Vol. I 2 N"], [326, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 304 secure a good choice before a rush should take place to the ground. After that he intended to proclaim his discovery and apply for the reward. This was an unlucky move; for during the course of that very week many others were on the trail, and a rival, Hiscock, was to spring to light, who received half of the two thousand pounds which Government would otherwise have given to Esmond. A few days were spent by Esmond in laying in a stock of necessary implements and a supply of provisions at Melbourne, and in superintending the construction of a gold-digger's cradle, the first ever made in Victoria. It was towards the end of July when he started back on the road to Clunes. As he passed through Geelong, he, after all, disclosed the situation of his discovery, and a considerable amount of excitement began to gather. Some thirty men, who were then prepared to start for Bathurst, resolved to wait, and to proceed to Clunes instead, as soon as Esmond should pass the word that he was ready.' When Esmond again reached his party, the inefficient work of the last two or three weeks was converted into gold-digging in the most approved Californian style ; one dug the earth out, another carried it in a wheelbarrow to the creek, another mixed it up in a tub and shovelled it out into the cradle, which Esmond himself rocked ceaselessly, pouring into it water from the creek, and from time to time withdrawing the gold left by the process of washing. The result of a fortnight's work was no more than eight ounces, which would yield about \u00a3i ios. per week for each man ; no startling result, yet twice as good as the current rate for labourers' work. The thirty diggers lost no time in joining, and there was a busy little corner down upon the banks of the deep creek. But the place was soon worked out. Esmond had got the only moderately good patch ; for though the place has since yielded mines of wealth, yet it has all been in the form of quartz that had to be crushed ; there was little alluvial gold, and therefore it was by no means the \" poor man's diggings,\" for which the)' were all in search. Towards the end of August, Commissioner Wright visited the place at Latrobe's desire, and reported that, while some of the men averaged ten shillings a day, the majority had only five, and they had taken the notion that all the gold was round, or under, Mr. Cameron's house, which they seemed anxious to undermine. The commissioner forbade them to dig within a mile of the house, and this circumstance led to a proclamation of Latrobe's, forbidding all digging for gold within a radius of half-a-mile from any inhabited dwelling. But long before this a second gold discovery had been made which led to important results. There was a resident at Buninyong named Thomas Hiscock, who, as a steady-going newspaper reader, had taken an abstract sort of interest in the gold question. He had been interested in reading of the Rev. Mr. Clarke's predictions. He had read and enjoyed the journalists' stories of California. He had been specially delighted by the exploits of Hargraves and the wonders of the Bathurst district. But it had never struck him as a matter of personal interest till he read of the reward offered, and heard that there were many people exploring the neighbouring hills for gold. Why might he not make an attempt for himself? He knew nothing of gold-prospecting, but he re-read some of the accounts of the manner in which it was carried on in California ; and so in the afternoon, when work was done he occasionally sallied forth to try for an hour or two in the surrounding gullies. The little town of Buninyong had acquired a certain degree of local importance; its little church, where the Rev. Mr. Hastie officiated, was the church of a vast district, and its school of sixty boarders, though but a collection of weatherboard shanties, was the educational establishment \" Tales of the Goldfields,\" by George Sutherland, M.A."], [327, "THE DISCOVERY OF GOLD.- 1831. 305 of the interior; on the side of the mountain a few neat cottages, Mrs. Jamieson's inn, a couple of stores and a blacksmith's shop, made quite a sociable little town; but all around was the silence of the bush, broken at intervals of six or eight miles by the squatter's house or the shepherd's hut. There were many gullies running out from the main spur into this pastoral region, and Hiscock tried them in turn. After a time he came upon one that yielded the yellow grains he had been dreaming of, and a match-box was filled with them after a few hours of work. But were they gold ? They were discovered on the 8th of August, and on the 10th of that month he was assured upon this point, for Mr. Alfred Clarke, the reporter of the Geelong Advertiser, was up among the hills trying to glean information. To him Hiscock showed the match-box and its shining contents. He assured him the metal was certainly gold, and very pure gold. With the consent of Hiscock the news was sent to the Geelong Advertiser, and therein published. Now, it so happened that this was during the week which Esmond had solicited as a fair start, and Hiscock's discovery was, in fact, announced the day before Esmond's was made publicly known, so that the two were ranked together as having been neck and neck in the race for discovery. But of the two, Hiscock's discovery was for the time the more popular. The road, or rather track, in the forest, which led to Buninyong, was soon invaded by a shovel-shouldering stream. But the weather was very bad \u2014 a soaking rain, and a week of cold and leaden skies. After plashing in muddy ruts for three or four days together, with wet clothes and only the soppy earth to sleep on, they were disinclined for camping out in Hiscock's Gull)', and this \"rush\" took a new form. The diggers invaded the house of \"Mother Jamieson.\" as they familiarly termed her, and the little inn had to accommodate about forty diggers, who sallied out in the morning to the gully, a mile away, carrying their spades, and \" Mother Jamieson's\" pie dishes and basins; they toiled all day, and returned steaming at night to sleep all over the place on tables, floors, verandahs, wherever a clear five feet of space were to be had. But they made very little profit out of it. The gully was by no means rich, and they earned less than ordinary wages by much more than ordinary labour, and a great deal of extraordinary discomfort. Hence they began to drift away off in the direction of Clunes, which was about thirty miles distant. With the restless disposition of gold-seekers, they were filled with hope that the other place would prove more fortunate. But the miners at Clunes were passing through precisely the same stage. They were working very hard and living in tents, with a limited supply of provisions, and making after all but a few shillings a day. They also were dissatisfied, and inclined to think that this new place, this Hiscock's Gully, near Buninyong, was the proper spot. They began to stream southward, and out of the meeting of these two opposite streams came the much more important discovery of Ballarat, and the origin of that famous goldfield which to this day remains the most notable the world has ever seen. It is impossible to decide with any feeling of certainty who was the first to discover these rich deposits. There were many claimants of that distinction ; for at least a score of men were at work within a couple of days of one another over a comparatively limited area, and when the only means of determining the question of priority is the evidence of gold-diggers who in vain tried to remember whether it was a Monday, a Tuesday, or a Wednesday when they first set to work on a particular spot, and who had only a very vague idea as to dates, the chance of unravelling the truth is in the last degree inconsiderable. But the Committee of the Legislative Council, which gathered such evidence as could be had, assigned the priority to three men of the name of Brown, Regan, and Dunlop. These men, however, were"], [328, "306 VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. not allowed to participate in the Government reward, which was thus distributed:\u2014 Hargraves was awarded \u00a35000, but of this sum, only \u00a32381 has ever been paid; he obtained \u00a310,000 from the Government of New South Wales ; other testimonials, public and private, raised the total of his reward to the handsome sum of about sixteen thousand pounds. From the Victorian Government the Rev. W. B. Clarke received \u00a31000, and Louis John Michel \u00a31000; Thomas Hiscock \u00a31000, and James Esmond .\u00a31000; Dr. Bruhn \u00a3500, and others \u00a3500 among them. But Golden Point at Ballarat was its own reward. Those who were there for a week before the rush set in were amply repaid for their exertions. The first to occupy the ground was Dunlop, though he failed to make any startling discovery. He had toiled to little purpose at Buninyong, and in a despondent fit had wandered down towards the valley of the River Leigh. That shallow current lay beneath his gaze, winding like a silvery snake with sinuous folds in the midst of a broad flat. A few sheep were dotted here and there, and a couple of shepherds' huts stood on that patch more verdant than the rest, which occupied one of the projecting tongues of land, round which the stream ran cheerily in its strong ripples a limpid current of two feet deep. It was the spot so soon to be well known under the name of Golden Point. Thither Dunlop had wandered, and there he had found an encouraging prospect, about \u00a32 worth for the day's work. Returning in the evening to the inn he tried to persuade his acquaintance, Donevon, to accompany him, but the weather was bad, and the latter thought it only another wild-goose chase, so Dunlop made his second offer to a fellow-lodger named Regan, who accepted, and the two departed down the hill to be soon lost to sight among the wattles that grew in feather)- clumps out upon the pretty little plain. What they did down there they never made public, but when they were gone for some three or four days, and there was no sign of their reappearance, Donevon suspected he had made a mistake. There was little hope of riches at Buninyong, and he thought he would sneak off and see what the truants were after. But there was a fourth visitor at the hotel who was destined to take a prominent share in the adventure. His name was Charles Brown. He had been a workman in a tallow chandler's place at Geelong, but with two others from the same shop had decamped one morning without notice. A friend joined them with an empty lemonade bottle in his pocket, and his proud ambition was to fill that bottle with gold-dust as a present to his sweetheart. They had a weary trudge to Buninyong, a wet and profitless time there of solid labour, and there was no beginning made in the filling of the sentimental bottle ; the trifle of gold they found was all too little even for expenses. Now, Brown had made the acquaintance of Donevon, as his fellow-lodger upon the same floor; and to him Donevon was something of an oracle, having been a couple of weeks longer in the profession. But, indeed, it was usual for unsuccessful diggers to keep a very sharp eye on the movements of their mates, in order to be ready to strike in whenever and wherever a promising spot should be discovered. And on hearing that Donevon had gone off down to the flat with a party of four whom he had secretly gathered, the man of the lemonade bottle being one, Brown grew anxious lest he should be likely to miss a good chance, and started off in pursuit. The disappearance of so many men set half-a-dozen others on the alert and they, too, packed up to go in search of Brown. Now Dunlop and Regan had built themselves a little hut on Poverty Flat,\" the first beginnings of the handsome city of Ballarat. But then it was lonely enough; modestly nestling among wattle trees, far from inviting observation, it kept strictly in the background, and it was \"\"Tales of the Goldfields,\" by George Sutherland, M.A., p. 3S."], [329, "THE DISCOVERY OF GOLD.\u2014 1831. 307 by a mere chance that Donevon and his three friends came upon the place. But when they saw it, they were certain that fortune would now befriend them. The aspect of the place fulfilled the conditions then sought for by the practical miner, for out of those scrubby hills that rose around, the quartz peeped through the grass in many a glistening patch of white, and beneath their feet the soil was a rich conglomerate of clay and gravel and quartz fragments. From out the neighbouring hills the rains of many a bygone hundred centuries had washed down the quartz, and with the quartz its veins of gold. But the metal is much too heavy to be carried by water unless with a rush down a rapid slope. On such a broad flat as this, with but a gentle fall, the mud, the clay, the quartz would roll away to the Barwon, but the gold must have gathered in ever-accumulating quantities. Donevon and his party informed Dunlop and Regan that they were come to join them. The pioneers would have preferred a few weeks of loneliness, but as it could not now be avoided, they welcomed the new comers, but with only sparing information as to their progress. However, the new comers made themselves comfortable in preparation for a commencement on the morrow, and the little camp was settling down for a quiet tea at sunset, when in came Brown, determined to see what was going forward. He resolved to stay, much to the disgust of the others, who wished to know if there were any others coming. Brown gave the information that they were, in truth, to be cheered by fresh society, as there were at least half-a-dozen on the road ; and when evening deepened they came in \u2014 Connor, Woodward, Jeanes, Smith and Thornton. The last arrived far on in the night; he was heard blundering about in the thickets where now is the Ballarat Town Hall, and many a loud cooee did he utter unanswered, the diggers at first intending to keep themselves quiet, and attract no more visitors, but as the time advanced towards midnight they relented, and by answering calls led him to their camp, which was now of moderate dimensions, a dozen men in all being there wrapped in slumber through that winter night, the 25th of August; and from that time forward Ballarat has been the constant habitation of men. But a dozen men could not in those days concentrate upon one spot without drawing many eyes towards them. Buninyong was a failure, and at once three other parties moved out to the new ground, with tents and proper appliances. Mr. James Oddie was the first that used a cradle ;' but soon the diggers from Clunes, who were then exploring down the river valley, heard of the gathering at Poverty Flat and the rumour that the parties there were doing well. Down they came to join the crowd ; Esmond himself was there with Pugh and others, making in all a party of nine, including a man named Cavanagh, destined to figure prominently before long. So the little camp on the flat at the foot of that gully, where the peppermint and stringybark forest made a pleasant glade, grew numerous and hopeful. For here at last there was money to be made \u2014 not sudden riches perhaps, but yet an excellent return. Esmond and Cavanagh worked together, and theirs was the best result. They sank a little pit of six feet in depth, and reached a bed of pipeclay, the mud formed from quartz ground down in bygone ages ; on this rested a thin stratum of a bluish-tinted clay. This latter substance proved to be as much gold dust as clay, and two days' work with the cradle took out of it a great fat bagful, half-a-hundredweight in all, under which one of the lucky owners fairly staggered when he attempted to carry it. Three thousand pounds for two days' labour of two men was the first sensational discovery made in Victoria ; but the neighbours of Esmond and Cavanagh were also extremely successful. The excitement that sprang up was intensified by the discovery hard by, of the famous Golden Point. Charles Brown, the tallowchandler, on arriving at the site of Ballarat had 3 Withers's \" History of Ballarat/' p. 29."], [330, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 308 joined with Connor and four others in making a party to work upon Poverty Flat, the only prospect yet made upon the Point having been considered poor, and not encouraging. But after he had been working a few days, he happened, while taking his evening walk, to kick a piece from off a quartz boulder that cropped up out of the flat ground towards the Point. A yellow gleam attracted him. The stone was thickly filled with gold. He concealed the fracture under earth, and put a few pieces of brushwood upon it in hasty stealth, for he knew there was a fortune there, and he must be the first to work it. But he had no appliances of his own, and he had no intention to share his good luck with Connor and the rest of his party. So, declaring he was tired of gold digging, he bade good-bye to his mates and returned to Geelong. But his only purpose was to buy apparatus and hire men to work on his account ; but he had no money, and precious time was lost before he could persuade a chemist to lend him twenty-five pounds for a month at a hundred per cent, per month interest. But what was that? He had a fortune waiting him. So off he went with a dray to carry himself, his tent, his cradle, his wheelbarrow, his provisions, and six stalwart fellows hired at twelve shillings a day. Their appearance at Poverty Flat must have had to the little digging community the look of business, but in the evening, after tea, when Brown went out to identify his discovery, he could nowhere find it ! He could see no sign of the bush or two he had placed as an unobtrusive mark. He hunted up and down, but saw nothing of the goldfield he had expected to open. He returned to his tea, which the men had kept for him, and took his meal in gloomy silence. He had that loan to pay back double, and he had six men to pay for a week at nearly four pounds each. How on earth he was to do it was a mystery, unless he could recover the lost traces. He retired with the others to rest, but not to slumber. His mind was filled with anxieties as to what six strong deluded fellows might do in a lonely place. He got up and paced the neighbourhood round by the Point, under the silence of a frosty moonlight. Yet no sign could be seen, and after a long effort he returned to rest till morning. As soon as daylight was gathered sufficiently to make his search more promising, he was up and at it. A fallen trunk gave him the first clue; he followed it up, and saw once more that centre of his day dreams. He soon had his men at work upon it ; and with fervent energy he set to work himself. The ground was wondrously rich. A hundred pounds a day for each man was the average yield, and five out of his six employes deserted him. But with the one that remained faithful he went on, and by the end of the week found himself the possessor of a thousand pounds worth of gold. He had a large tent which he pitched across the mouth of his claim to conceal his operations, but, in spite of that, his neighbours began to close around him, and in especial that party of nine from Clunes were close alongside, two of them, Esmond and Cavanagh, as we have already seen, proceeding at once to distance by a long way the good fortune of Brown himself. Indeed, Brown's share was almost confined to his first thousand pounds, for after that his claim seemed nearly worked out, and there was then quite a concourse of people occupying all the most promising spots around. In an ill-advised humour he wandered off in search of fresh goldfields, and missed his chance of the much greater wonders that were to come. The month of September saw at least a hundred men at work at what they began to call Balla-arat, a name meaning \"resting-place,\" given by the native shepherds of the district to the green retreat on the river bank at Golden Point. They all crowded on that treasure hiding spot, and it seemed as if quarrels might arise ; but with a strong good sense and love of order that characterised these early adventurers in spite of their eagerness and suspicion"], [331, "THE DISCOVERY OF GOLD.\u2014 185 1. 309 they agreed to measure out the ground and assign it by lot. Eight feet of frontage to the river was the limit, but each allotment ran indefinitely back and up the hill. No more match-boxes as at Buninyong for gathering the gold in. Stout bags were made and rapidly filled. Connor had his well bulged with twenty pounds weight, which he sold for a thousand pounds before the end of September. Others were equally fortunate, and it became a very busy corner that \u2014 very busy indeed. From dawn to sunset the wheelbarrows trudged with heavy loads to and fro from the claims to the water's edge: the tubs, made out of casks sawn through the middle, stood there, with brawny arms and stout poles mixing up in them the soil and the river waters ; the cradles, a dozen of them, rocked all day with creak and bump, and poured forth their streams of villainous mud that already left a clay-stained streak for a mile or two down the stream ; and Victoria had its first great goldfield in full operation.10 But a week before the discovery of Ballarat, Governor Latrobe had been convinced that a time of gold and gold excitement was dawning for the colony. He was greatly relieved when he was able to report that gold had been discovered at the beginning of August in three places \u2014 at Clunes, at Buninyong, and at Anderson's Creek ; for he had looked on with alarm while a couple of thousand of his small population were gone off to Bathurst, and while several thousands more were preparing to be off likewise so soon as the pleasant spring weather should set in. He was pleased, but anxious. For this was a new development, and what he might do, or what he might leave undone, would probably have a prominent influence in moulding the future history of the colony. Now, Latrobe's great failing, amid decided abilities and unswerving honesty of purpose, was an excessive anxiety lest he should incur the censure of his superior officers ; lest some of those rough rebukes and summary suspensions might be his share which had lately befallen the Governors of Tasmania. Here was a sudden emergency, too pressing to permit of his seeking advice in London ; yet he was now not supposed to be subordinate to the Governor at Sydney. Though pleased, therefore, at the prospect of a golden era for the colony, he was worried by the weight of responsibility it brought, and in all his subsequent despatches one may read the feeling of anxiety, of irritability sometimes, beneath the weight of a responsibility he feared to incur. His tone continually is that he trusted his Lordship would not be offended ; he had done all he had done with the best of intentions. He humbly trusted his Lordship might not think that, under the trying and singularly perplexing circumstances, he had acted unwisely. Latrobe's tenure of office was clearly coming to an end ; for his own despatches, clever though they were, and worthy of all the praise which the Times bestowed upon them, revealed his want of self-reliance, and more than hinted his want of administrative capacity. To begin with, Latrobe contented himself with a simple imitation of the policy adopted by Fitzroy in New South Wales. He issued a proclamation in the same words, asserting the right of the Crown to all gold found in unalienated lands. On the 1 8th of August he announced that persons would be authorised to dig for that gold if furnished with licenses, for which they were to pay thirty shillings a month. The licenses were to begin from the 1st of September. Matters at Ballarat, therefore, had barely begun to turn out prosperous when up rode two commissioners, Armstrong and Doveton, to issue licenses and collect the fees, and lest there should be an)- mistake as to the intentions of Government, there came also Captain Pulteney Dana, with eight or ten black troopers, carbines slung, sabres jangling. The commissioners pitched their tent on the brow of a little hill behind the Gulden Point, \"Tales of the Goldfields,\" p. 55"], [332, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 310 and the troopers camped close by. Then the commissioners sallied forth to see if there was really any production of gold to justify the imposition of the fee. But the diggers were mostly prepared for the visit, and kept the gold well out of sight. However, their proceedings were ill-advised ; the commissioners, always on the spot, could not fail to learn the truth, and it was a matter of no moment that Connor was the first to give the troopers a hint of it. He had incautiously left a pannikin full of gold-dust outside his tent, and the troopers saw it ; but that merely made the difference of a day or so. However, the diggers affected to be very much disgusted at the carelessness of Connor, and when they heard that the old man had gone up to the commissioners' tent and paid his fifteen shillings for the half of September that was still to run, some of the rougher ones ill-treated the poor old fellow, pelting him with clay till he was cased in yellow, when the more moderate diggers released him from their clumsy jocularity. Then the diggers held a meeting, and one of their number, named Swindells, got upon a stump and harangued them, calling upon them by the glories of their ancestors, and their rights as men, not to pay the tax of the slave to the tyrant. It was resolved that a deputation consisting of Swindells and Oddie should proceed to the commissioners and expostulate with them, and if necessary state their firm intention of paying no license fee, at least for September. The commissioner was a man of few words. He said he had not made the law, but had been sent to enforce it. If they declined to pay the tax he would very soon compel them to do so.\" The black troopers lounging around looked an ominous crew, and it certainly did not seem worth fifteen shillings to provoke a conflict. So one by one, each seeking to conceal his defection from the rest, they made their appearance, paid the fee, and were licensed to the end of September. In the course of a day or two the road through Buninyong became thronged with people on their way to Ballarat. Seven hundred were at work before a week after Esmond's lucky discovery, and on the 1st of October the commissioners issued 500 licenses for the ensuing month.'\"' But within a week 800 others took out licenses ; and as the people still surged up it was found necessary to reduce the area allowed for a single claim. The commissioners marked off for each new arrival a piece eight feet square as his allotment, and the arrangements thus made were generally adhered to. On 2nd October the Melbourne papers reported that a general movement was taking place towards the goldfields. The Daily News lamented the loss of all its compositors, and so serious was the disappearance of bank clerks that one of them was apprehended and tried under the Masters and Servants' Act for deserting his position ; but the magistrates decided that the Act did not apply to clerks ; in several places the clerks of courts ran off to the diggings, and the progress of the law was stayed. But the chief excitement, as might be expected, was among the working classes, who learnt with eager interest from the papers that the average earnings at Ballarat were four pounds per man per da)-. That of itself would have brought them in great numbers, but the sensational good fortune of a few lucky diggers had a much greater attraction. For the first few weeks the claims had never been tested to a greater depth than about ten feet. The diggers had gone down through the red earth and gravel, through the streaky yellowish clay, through a layer of quartz gravel, through a thinner stratum of blue and white clay, and then they had \" bottomed,\" as they called it, on pipe-clay. In all the strata as they descended the)' found gold till they reached the pipe-clay, where not a grain was to be found. There they desisted therefore, and hurried off with feverish anxiety to make the most of their time and open up new ground. Withers's \" History of Ballarat,\" p. 35. '- Latrobe's report, House of Commons Papers, p. 44."], [333, "THE DISCOVERY OF GOLD.\u2014 183 1. 311 But that companion of Esmond's, named Cavanagh, thought it might be well to try what lay below the pipe-clay; he tried in one of the deserted pits, carried it a few feet deeper, and unlocked one of the secrets of the earth. There lay treasures as yet unequalled ; so concentrated was the gold that these places, when opened through the pipe-clay all around, became familiarly known in the district as the \"jewellers' shops.\" In far distant days, in the dim geological ages of a few millions of years ago, the heavy rains of the silurian epoch had sent a mighty river through this valley, and in its bed the golden pebbles had lodged wherever rocks or other obstacles provided a quiet corner for them to settle in. There they had formed \" pockets \" of gold, in pieces from the size of a pea to that of a plum. But when the long cycles of time had run their course, with physical changes there came the sea, rolling many fathoms deep over all the scene; an ocean slumbered over all the continent or lashed the little islets left where the highest mountain tops still raised their rocky heads. Then the river gorge had its hundred thousand years in which to fill, and the golden pockets were buried far out of view. The waters retreated. The bare bed of the sea renewed its foliage, and the landscape in slow re covery waved once more with verdure. The hills were timber clad once more, and once more they poured their streams down into the grassy valley ; but not the flood-like deluges of bygone epochs ; the river was' now but the ghost of that which once had thundered past. It carved its narrow bed, it filled in flood time its adjoining flats with mud that was rich in gold, but never to OFF TO THE DIGGINGS ! be compared with the wealth of the far-off cycles, that wealth which nestled beneath the many feet of sea-strewn clay. Cavanagh is said to have gathered ,\u00a31800 worth of gold in four hours, picking up the nuggets, and filling a tin dish with them till he could barely lift it. Very soon it became the fashion to carry the diggings deeper ; many failed to light upon a suitable patch, but others had the delight of revelling for a day or two in a \" jeweller's shop,\" and there were not a few who could exhibit a thousand pounds worth of gold as the result of a day's work. When all this was recorded in the daily papers ; when a four-column article could scarcely chronicle the wonders of the past week ; when the marvels of the journalistic phantas magoria dangled a daily temptation before the eyes of the community, how was it possible that there could fail to be an all-absorbing excitement? Latrobe reports on the 10th October that for the last ten days the streets of Melbourne and Geelong have been encumbered by drays along the kerbing, all busy loading at the shops with necessaries for the diggings. An unusual bustle pervaded the streets; and shopmen, artisans, tradesmen, clerks, with a sprinkling Vol. 1. 2 O"], [334, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT 312 of the doctors and lawyers, were bundling up their bedding and their linen to join a party and a dray. Then came a period of depressing stillness \u2014 the men were all gone ; the schools were closed for want of teachers, the stores for want of salesmen ; the Government works were all stopped, for the contractors had not a man left to go on with them. That this is no exaggeration, a little calculation will show. The colony contained about 75,000 persons, of whom 45,000 were males ; about 30,000 of these might be assumed to be of adult years, or perhaps 25,000 able-bodied men capable of work. Now it is known that within a week of the date of Latrobe's despatch there were over 10,000 men at Ballarat ; but these came mostly from Melbourne, Geelong, Portland, and Warrnambool, for the news and excitement were slower to reach and slower to move those on the stations and outlying districts. It is therefore well within the bounds of sober truth to assert that very much more than half the able-bodied men of these towns had abandoned them for the diggings. Hence the silence, the aspect of desertion, which prevailed where haunts of busy men had been but a fortnight ago. Latrobe had himself been an early visitor to the goldfields. He went in the first week of October, ere the luckiest discoveries had been made, and when there were as yet but 2500 men at work. However, he passed, as he computed, between one and two thousand on the road. He saw about four hundred cradles at work, and he stopped to watch the process, and saw worth of gold washed out of a claim. He saw two tin dishes of blue clay washed and yield worth. But of course it was evident that in process of time these lucrative yields would diminish, for the people were coming at the rate of a hundred per day ; the ground must soon be all taken up ; each person would have but the one claim to try his fortune in, and when that was worked out some other field must be discovered or all must go back again to their avocations. Latrobe expected the reaction, and it came. At the end of October, those who had drawn a blank in the lottery, and those who were physically unfit for hard labour, were already on their way back. And yet there was no diminution of the ten thousand diggers round Golden Point ; for the fever had touched the neighbouring colonies, and the arrivals by sea alone were at the rate of over 1500 per month, which more than balanced the numbers that departed from the diggings. But the flow of men and the counter-flow made a wonderfully busy scene upon that many-rutted track they called the road to Ballarat. Suppose we take a trip in fancy along that road and see the humours of the time:'3 There are a couple of four-horse coaches running daily to Ballarat; but these are not the popular conveyances. Those who can afford to take the means of making themselves comfortable like to hire a dray for their property, and while one drives, the rest walk alongside ; thus parties from three to seven are there trudging with merry step and light hearts, enjoying the open air and the gathering spring. The dray jogs steadily along, down into ruts and up over rocky ridges, with tents and boxes of provisions and bedding well piled, and conspicuous over all, the cradle of the party. Here are a few with hand carts pushing and pulling as if life and death were in the race. Yonder goes a stout-hearted fellow trundling his wheel barrow before him. But as numerous a class as any are the \" swagsmen,\" trudging along on foot, bent under the weight of their goods that are strapped upon their backs, and with a clinking accompaniment of tin pot's and pannikins. The scattered travellers close up ; we are in a crowd, and conscious that there is a block in front. It is a river, and the drays must be unloaded, the goods carried over, and the jolting \"This description is partly drawn from \"Australian Sketches,\" by Thomas M'Combie, who, in October 1S51. left his business in Melbourne and betook himself to the goldfields; partly from William Howitt, partly from other sources."], [335, "THE DISCOVERY OF GOLD.\u2014 1831. 313 BALLARAT IN .855, AS VIEWED FROM BATH'S HOTEL.

Many of these stoppages occur, and the days are consumed, and not till after five or six are past are the ranges encountered. There are, as yet, no properly constructed roads. The good-humoured crowd occasionally put their shoulders to the wheels of the drays and take them up the steeper pinches ; but in spite of that the willing beasts have much straining of the muscles of their hind legs and a wilderness of shouts and oaths to experience before they reach the corner named of Inglis, where the descent begins down to the valley. Here the road is densely crowded, like that to a popular race meeting. We are but four miles off, and before long a deep hum is heard that grows louder and louder in our ears at every minute. At length there is a turn in the road, and, looking downward, we have our first glimpse of it, while the full roar, as of a hundred busy streets rolled into one, bursts upward from the spacious valley. It is a scene that must make a life-long impression, and many, in spite of their eagerness, wait a little to enjoy its picturesque effect. The multitude of toilers gives that strange sensation of an ant hill, as if the very earth were living and in turbulent commotion. Thousands of men are trotting busily to and fro with barrows ; a thousand cradles rock with a roar that is loud as a giant foundry, but unlike any thing else. The ground is dotted with holes, out of which and into which the little forms of men below us are ceaselessly popping with restless motion. Ten thousand heaps of earth rise over all the scene, red and yellow, white and grey, with occasional patches of green left undisturbed, and a few forlorn trees yet standing here and there, and the shining white of the pointed tents interspersed all over the scene. The first feeling of glamour a little subsides when we descend and lose the general view of the whole extent. Yet even when we are in the very heart of the bustle there is an exhilaration in it all \u2014 the men are so eager, the work so brisk, the open air surroundings so cheerful. At six o'clock, however, it slackens off, and a lull is distinctly audible ; in a few minutes the din has ceased, and only the wide-spread hum of voices is heard. Then rise innumerable wreaths of bluish-tinted smoke ; then crackle the brushwood fires over many an acre, and a thousand steaming pots are swung each in the midst of its circling blaze. The little groups are seated in the open air, for the evening is pleasant, and the gathering twilight cool and tranquil. There is many a burst of loud laughter to be heard above the hum of conversation. The twilight deepens into darkness. The knots disperse, the tents are all aglow, and seem of yellow translucence when the lamps and candles are lit within. And now begins the dropping fire of musketry, shot answering shot in quick succession over all the field. For the miners have adopted the fashion of discharging their arms each night after sunset. Some say it is to see that no one has been tampering with the charge, and that it is good to have the weapon reloaded before retiring to rest with so many unknown people close around. Some say it is to let the evil-disposed know that weapons are at hand and in good order. But however the custom arose, it is in the main a mere fashion which the digger follows out of exuberance of feeling. If he has been fortunate during the day, it relieves his exulting mind ; if unlucky, it bids defiance to fortune, and serves to keep his courage up. A noisier sound than usual from one of the shining tents shows where some enterprising law-breaker has brought forth his ten-gallon case of brandy, and is selling it at three or four shillings a drink; very cautiously, however, for the black troopers are sharp in detecting what are known as \"sly grog shops.\" What with drinking and gambling for matchboxes full of gold-dust, and for little nuggets, and greasy notes, the commoner class of diggers keep the place lively till midnight. But then the noises cease, save a festive stave or two from a home"], [337, "THE DISCOVERY OF GOLD.\u2014 183/. 315 returning digger, who has been keeping up his evening till a late hour. Then the lights are gone; silence deep and impressive spreads over the scene, and the very brawl of the stream that is striving to wash itself clear of the terrible stains of the day is heard through all the slumbering camp. At six in the morning, as if by common consent, the bustle of the day begins. Again the slender blue columns, again the circles round the steaming tea; and about seven o'clock the toil and turmoil recommence. Up yonder on the hillside, where the twenty government tents make a goodly show, there is a constant traffic of men. If it is the beginning of the month, they wish to take out licenses ; or if it is Monday, they are more likely anxious to consign their gold to the commissioner for transport by the escort, which leaves every Tuesday morning at daybreak. Leading up to the government quarters is a long line of rather handsomer tents than the average. They form a perfect street of some width. This is what is known as \"Regent-street.\" It is inhabited by the aristocratic folks of the diggings, mostly young men who wear red scarves round their waists, but dig up little gold. Each one of them has a flag flying at his door. This street descends the hill towards the creek, and there expands into a square, called by its occupants Belgravia, but known to the diggers as \" Swell Square,\" being the abode of the clerks, the doctors, the merchants, the surveyors, and so forth, who have come to Ballarat to try their fortune. Up yonder on that timber-clad hill there is a new rush beginning. There are a thousand miners there. It is called Brown Hill, after one of the crew from \" Mother Jamieson's\" at Buninyong, who first opened a claim on the hillside. His name was Brownbill, but that was a syllable more than the diggers had time for.\" But the people who made most money in the end were those astutcr persons who undertook to provide this vast crowd with necessaries. The man who bought a flock of sheep from a squatter hard by at nine shillings each could cut them up into mutton and sell them for very nearly as many pounds; and though flour and other provisions cost a great deal of money to carry to the diggings, yet the holder of the temporary store could get all that and half-a-dozen times as much again restored to him by charging a preposterous price, which the reckless diggers freely paid. However, as yet, there were no permanent buildings erected, not even a weatherboard place, for no one knew when the field would give out and the district be deserted. And soon the turn of events showed the wisdom of that policy. For in another fortnight not six hundred persons were left at Ballarat. A newer and more surprising goldfield had \" broken out,\" as the diggers called it. The Mount Alexander goldfield dated back as far as the 10th of September, but it took some time to assert its prominence and attract the multitude. It had its origin in an accidental discovery by a shepherd named Christopher Peters, who was employed on the station of Mr. William Barker, in the heart of that smiling country round the present site of Castlemaine which had so taken the fancy of Captain Hepburn when he traversed it fifteen years before. In his lonely days, dawdling among his sheep, Peters had fallen in with the prevalent fashion of chipping and scratching in search of gold. After some profitless weeks of that sort he at length, on the 10th of September, chanced to light on a thin slice of gold-bearing quartz, lying as if sandwiched between two beds of slate. He broke out a piece of it, which he spent his evening in powdering with a hammer outside his solitary bark hut. There was plenty of gold left when he washed away the light grey powder ; he secretly communicated his discovery to three of \" Withers, p. 30."], [338, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 316 fryer's creek, near castlemaine, 1852. (After sketch by S. T. Gill.) his comrades on the station \u2014 George Robinson and Robert Keen, who were both shepherds, and John Warley, who was a bullock driver. They gave notice of leaving to their employer, and said they were going off to the diggings ; but they took the road, not to Ballarat, but to the scene of Peters's discovery, down in a hollow, which they called Specimen Gully. There they kept themselves concealed for a month, laboriously tunneling with imperfect appliances into the slaty hillside, and extracting, with a wasteful rudeness, the gold that was contained in the thin, but rich, stratum of quartz. Keeping their efforts as quiet as possible, making a fire but seldom, they toiled and worked their way some forty feet into the hill. They then had between four and five pounds weight of gold, and, in their ignorance, they feared to conceal their operations any further. They knew that, from the ist of September, all who took gold out of Crown lands were bound to have a license, and they had none. Of course, there had been no one in the district from whom to secure a license, but they thought that some evil might happen to the gold they had got if they continued to work unlicensed. Peters, therefore, wrote to the Argus, in Melbourne, relating in a few words the story of their discovery, and asking the editor to inform the authorities that they were willing to pay anything reasonable that should be asked of them. Thereupon Mr. Powlett, the commissioner, rode over. As they had no licenses, he demanded a royalty, and they had to pay him besides thirty shillings apiece for permission to continue at work. After this deduction they netted about \u00a3225 for about twenty-five days' work, which gave them something over \u00a32 a day each, nothing very startling, perhaps, but, still a good return for their labour, and from their own story it was plain that they might easily have doubled or trebled that amount with skill and a few proper appliances. So in the middle of October a stream of diggers began to cross the ranges from Ballarat and traverse the gloomy woodlands and wattle scented parks that lay for fifty miles on the way to Forest Creek, as the diggings were at first called. It was a great scramble, the prevalent impression being that he who was first on a goldfield"], [339, "THE DISCOVERY OF GOLD.\u2014 1 8 31. 317 had all the best place to himself, and was sure of a fortune, while those who came late might have a claim marked out for them where gold was utterly absent. So they posted up the hills and down the gullies, and over grassy flats, in an impetuous race, and each, as he arrived, traversed the ground with eager quest, unwilling to lose a minute lest someone else might pick the likeliest locality. In a couple of days there were 250 on the spot, and the commissioner had issued 170 licenses. Latrobe, who was then visiting Ballarat, rode over to this new scene of excitement. He saw a party secure several pounds weight of gold in a few hours, and in this locality the treasure was easily reached. The gravel that filled the bottom of the gully was loose, and rich with the scales and little lumps that spangled the bed of the creek wherever upturned. It was a characteristic of the gold-diggers that three-fourths of them were always ready at any moment to abandon the field they were on in the hopes of finding somewhere else a chance like that which was making their lucky neighbours wealthy. So the larger part of the Ballarat diggers in a month or less had beaten deep the track that led to Forest Creek. But the first small area could not contain the crowds that poured into it ; they followed the creeks up and down, and spreading themselves over an area of twelve or fifteen square miles, they lined with their tents both sides of all the creeks of the district. Barker's Creek, which joins the Forest Creek at the present site of Castlemaine; Campbell's Creek, into which they pour their waters before joining the Loddon; Fryer's Creek, which enters the Loddon a little further up, all had their lines of tents, making altogether some seven or eight miles of flapping canvas, generally a little dirty after a month of use at Ballarat. The district as a whole received its name from Mount Alexander, that eminence called Mount Byng, by Mitchell, which stands behind Castlemaine. In many places the deposits of gold were much richer than any yet discovered even in Ballarat, though that district was yet to recover its pride of place. At the beginning of December Latrobe reports that the gold is being received by the commissioners in hundredweights, that the escort each week brings away about two tons of it ; that while the total yield from Ballarat up to date may be estimated at about \u00a3270,000, that from Mount Alexander for a period of a month less is about \u00a3360,000. It was not surprising, therefore, that the gold fever of the colony was renewed in intensity, Many who had resisted the temptations of Ballarat succumbed to those of Mount Alexander; and when the eager flood of prospectors unearthed the still richer deposits of Bendigo Creek, some twenty miles to the north, the last touch was given that upset the stoicism of the coolest head. The turnkeys of all the gaols resigned, the warders of the lunatic asylum decamped. Out of forty police who were stationed in Melbourne, thirty-eight sent in their resignations for the end of December; and the New Year's holidays found a city of twenty thousand people with two constables to keep order. There were fifty-nine vessels lying in the bay. They had 1029 seamen ; 521 of these disappeared for the diggings, and the others had to be watched; the ships kept a couple of miles from the shore, and elaborate precautions were taken to prevent the departure of the half crews left ; but many of these found opportunities to desert, though they left their clothes, or carried with them only a little hand-bundle. Some vessels that had only two men apiece offered \u00a380 a man for a crew to take them home, but that could induce nobody; \u00a3100 had as little effect; and it was only by the payment of \u00a3120 that a vessel which was bound to return to England within a given time, could bribe a common seaman to ship for a voyage, for which the ordinary rate would have been \u00a3$. The resignations of those in the civil service flowed in at such a rate that Latre.be had on his own responsibility, and with many misgivings, to increase the salaries all round by about"], [340, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS .* PAST AND PRESENT. 318 a half ; and he threatened that all who embarrassed the Government then would never be allowed to return to its service. Nevertheless, the survey branch and the public works department had practically to be closed. To increase the excitement, there returned to Melbourne for their Christmas holidays some two or three thousand successful diggers, either to enjoy that joyous season with the families they had left ; or to allow themselves the dissipations of a city in return for a month or two of rough life. They scattered their money and their gold dust with reckless freedom. Mr. H. C. E. Childers, afterwards a Cabinet minister of England, but at this time immigration agent for the Government at Melbourne, reported on the second day of the year that the prices of all articles had doubled, and some had trebled, while the remuneration for labour of all sorts had nearly quadrupled.'5 But meantime the neighbouring colonies were being equally infected with the fever. Tasmania sent over four thousand of her scanty population, and the traveller in that island can still, to the present day, be shown the pile of bricks intended for some spacious mansion, which the workmen commenced, but left when only commenced, and never returned to finish. He may still see some ruined mill which he is told the miller and his men abandoned and never returned to. The numbers who came from New South Wales and South Australia could never be determined, but Latrobe estimates them at many thousands. Certainly the fields at Ophir and Turon were almost wholly deserted, the diggers being attracted over the border by the fame of Mount Alexander. Governor Fitzroy reported that Sydney wore an air of evident desertion, and that crowds of people were going off to the diggings who had neither the strength nor the constitution for the life of the miner. Latrobe was in a state of extreme anxiety. No one could tell what new excitement would occur without a moment's notice; and with expiree convicts pouring in at the rate of some seven or eight hundred a week, frightful disorders might occur for which he would be responsible. He saw with dismay the police all gone with the crowd. He had forty-four soldiers in the barracks at King-street. These seemed true to their colours, or knew too well the penalty of desertion from the army, but they were not sufficient for ordinary police duty, as only five policemen were left in all the colony. He wrote asking Fitzroy to spare him as man)' soldiers as possible ; in reply there came thirty to increase the force at his command. He wrote to Governor Denison, in Hobart, who found he could spare no troops, but raised a body of one hundred and thirty men, \u2014 old soldiers, and pensioners all of them, who were induced by the extra payment offered, to take service with the Government of Victoria. But Latrobe looked with dreadful suspense to that flood of people who, as California's experience had shown, would pour upon Victorian shores when the impetus had had time to spread to foreign lands and send back its answering currents \u2014 a mighty host \" owning no allegiance to Great Britain.\" He urged that Melbourne should be made the head-quarters of a regiment and the station for a man-of-war. Sir John Pakington, who was now at the head of the Colonial Office in London, replied that four companies of the 59th Regiment would be directed to. proceed from Hongkong to Melbourne, but that Victoria would be expected to provide their barracks, their pay, and all costs of their maintenance. But as the necessity, according to Latrobe, was pressing, the British Government altered their arrangements and sent 400 men direct to Melbourne from the 40th Regiment, under the command of Lieut. -Colonel Valiant. A man-of-war was also despatched to lie in Hobson's Bay for a time and observe the progress of events. Sir John \u25a0i Latrobe's Despatch, January 12th, 1852. Enclosure 8."], [341, "THE DISCO VER Y OF G OLD. \u20141831. 3 , g Pakington also offered to send out fifty picked men of the Irish Mounted Constabulary, from such as were willing to volunteer, and Latrobe accepted their services with many thanks. They were a valuable accession. But before any of these aids could arrive some anxious months had to pass, and Latrobe tried by legislative means to lessen the danger. A stringent proclamation against the illicit sale of liquor on the goldfields, against gambling, against obscene language, was intended to hold the miners well in check. A fine of five pounds was to be imposed for a first offence on all persons found mining without a license, fifteen pounds for a second, and thirty pounds for a third offence. It was in the beginning of all this excitement that Latrobe met his first Legis lative Council, on the nth November, 1S51. Its earliest duties were financial, and Latrobe had to announce the greatly increased scale of payments that would thenceforth be neces sary; while as yet the revenue had not seriously benefited by the gold discovery. The fourteen thousand pounds received for licenses had failed to pay the Government expenses on the goldfields. The Mount Alexander district required 179 officials and troopers to keep the 20,000 people in order, and all these required horses, whose forage, carted at thirty pounds a ton, amounted to quite a fortune. If the license fee could be rigorously exacted, even then the goldfields would only pay their own expenses, but in such a crowd not half were reached by the troopers. And then there were all the in creased salaries and payments of the general Government; there must be a larger revenue raised in some way. The Council took the squatter's view of the difficulty, and asserted that there should be no increase of taxation for such a purpose. The gold diggers had LICENSING DIGGERS \u2014 FOREST CREEK, 1S52. (After a sketch by S. T. Gill.) brought the difficulty, let them pay for it. The squatters wanted no gold excitement ; why should they and the quiet people who stayed at home be taxed for their benefit ? Let the diggers pay a bigger license fee. They were well able to afford it, so it was believed. And thus it was recommended that the license fee should be doubled. Latrobe, therefore, on the 1st of December, issued a notice that from the first day of the new year the license fee would be three pounds per month. This proclamation aroused the deepest execration of the people on the goldfields. The fee had always been unpopular. It seemed an indignity that a man should have to go off and have himself licensed before he could by his heavy toil remove from waste land the gold that was the property, as they considered it, of no one. And besides, out of twenty thousand miners, there were probably but a couple of thousand who actually drew wealth from the soil. There might be ten thousand who Vol. I. 2 P"], [342, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 320 made excellent wages, but still not so great but that three pounds a month would be a considerable fraction to them; and the remainder were to a greater or less extent unsuccessful, large numbers of them not earning so much as three pounds per month. And, moreover, Latrobe had announced that not only diggers, but all persons residing on a goldfield \u2014 storekeepers, tent-makers, butchers, every man in fact\u2014 would have to pay the license. No wonder then, that when an indignation meeting was called at Mount Alexander, it was large and emphatic. The speakers were strong in their language, and menacing in some of their allusions. The general feeling on the goldfields was unanimously with them. Latrobe heard with alarm of their attitude. The reports of his officers were far from reassuring. He had unwittingly provoked an ill-feeling which might burst at any moment into a violent explosion; and what could he do when it occurred? The diggers were all armed. WThat if a thousand, what if only five hundred banded together and marched on Melbourne? He had only his forty-four soldiers, and could not rely on so many as ioo men ; for the reinforcements from the neighbouring colonies had only then been asked for, and could not arrive for some time- Latrobe was well-meaning, but over-burdened with responsibility, kindly but not decisive. He hastily withdrew his first proclamation, less than a fortnight after its publication, and afforded the more turbulent spirits among the diggers all the triumph of a victory. He fell back upon the land fund, though with many misgivings, for his instructions were strict that he was not to employ that fund in payment of current expenses ; but he trusted that the circumstances of the case would form a sufficient excuse. And certainly the land fund was in a healthy enough state to endure a little diminution without harm. The speculative among the population had no sooner perceived that the gold excitement was likely to be permanent than they at once calculated on the arrival of great numbers of immigrants whose presence they easily foresaw would cause a great demand for land. But nineteen-twentieths of the land of the colony were locked from sale by the long leases of the squatters. Those parts named \"settled\" and \"intermediate\" would not long suffice at this altered rate ; the price must increase, and these people of much foresight at once commenced the process of buying land, and at the close of the year the treasury had received over two hundred thousand pounds as the proceeds of land sales, an amount only exeeded in 1840 among past years, but destined to be more than trebled in 1852. In two months the sales of Melbourne land realised fifty thousand pounds. Everybody was in expectation of the crowds that were to come. For there was clearly no abatement of the attraction. On 2nd March, 1852, Latrobe reported that fully thirty thousand men were scattered over the Mount Alexander district. Ballarat was held by a small band of not more than two hundred, but as these were said to be averaging six pounds a week per man, there was commencing a return flow of the less successful diggers from other parts. Other diggings were offering counter attractions. The M'lvor Creek, where now stands Heathcote, was for some time a favourite district ; and all round it, that pastoral region where A. F. Mollison had pitched his camp at Pyalong some thirteen years before, was overrun by prospecting crowds. Away towards the Broken River, in the Benalla district, gold had been found as early as the end of September, but not till the beginning of April was there any great public notice of it; then it began to assume the aspect of a gold field. The fears of Latrobe were therefore groundless when he had gloomy thoughts of his position if the gold should suddenly fail and a great population of disappointed men should be left starving, perhaps, after a period of dissipation and extravagance. So anxious was he on this point that in the previous October he had requested the Imperial Government to send him an experienced"], [343, "THE DISCOVERY OF GOLD.\u2014 183 1. 321 geologist, whom he could employ in looking out for new goldfields and directing the search of the miners by scientific indications. In response, the Colonial Office on 25th May appointed Mr. A. R. Selvvyn, who arrived some months later; but his presence, though needed in many ways, was not necessary for the discovery of goldfields. They were, indeed, discovered with distracting frequency, and kept the miners in a perfect fever by their conflicting attractions. But Bendigo Creek, in the extreme north of the Mount Alexander district, was at this period by a long way the most popular. There a lucky miner had taken out in a single lump about fourteen hundred pounds worth of gold, and cases were frequent enough in which each man of a party of four secured \u00a3200 for a single day's work. Sometimes, however, the freaks of fortune were most tantalising. One case was known in which a party of four Irishmen opened no less than twenty-nine pits, and carried them all down to the bed-rock without getting an ounce of gold. Their resources were gone, their hopes dissolved, their bodies worn out with unremitting toil. They resolved to go home again if they could. But one of them proposed to make their number of attempts the even thirty. They once more sank their shaft, came upon the wash-dirt, carried up enough to fill two casks, and out of these two casks took five thousand pounds' worth of gold. When the month of April, in 1852, came to an end, the colony had exported over two million pounds worth of gold ; but the real production had probably exceeded three millions. For that month the number of licenses was only twelve short of twenty thousand, and that was com puted to indicate a population of about forty thousand as the aggregate for the goldfields; and the monthly yield at that time exceeded half a million, or six times the total previous rate of production of the colony in all its various pursuits. Meantime the rate of production was steadily increasing ; in May it was not far short of a million pounds for the month, a sum equal to the annual exports of the colony in the most flourishing years it had ever seen since its birth. No wonder, then, that the people continued to troop over the borders \u2014 from New South Wales at the rate of a thousand a month throughout the early part of 1852 ; from Tasmania at the rate of two thousand a month, and from South Australia even more than two thousand. But every one knew that this was but the prelude to what was coming. Some with fear and some with hopeful anticipation ; some with dread, as they calculated the rising prices and balanced them against their fixed incomes ; some with exultation, as they saw their chances coming nearer every day of selling property of all sorts at ten times its previous value. The holder of sheep or of cattle ; of flour, or timber, or spirits ; of land, or houses, or shops, made more money by the gold discovery in very many cases, than the luckiest digger that ever opened out a claim. And all were eagerly awaiting the turn of fortune when the news should have had time to work like leaven in the teeming, the restless, the discontented millions of Europe. And even then it was at work. Even then the young fellow in a thousand provincial towns of England, in a thousand quaint old places of the continent, read in his daily paper or drank in at his workshop bench, or picked up in the resorts of his fellows, the golden stories of a land which to them was all romance. Never before heard of! All the more romantic for that. A land of sunshine \u2014 too sunny perhaps, but that was a pleasant thought to men who had passed through several foggy winters and sulky summers. The young fellow had his dreams ; he would toil no longer for twelve or fifteen shillings a week, \u2014 not he. He would start for the Golden Victoria. He would find the secret spot where the earth enfolded her nuggets. He would prove himself as much a man as any of them, and return with his well stuffed bags of gold. Perhaps it was his old mother he was thinking of, who should thenceforward"], [344, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 322 suffer no more the penury of those hard times. Perhaps it was the sweetheart, whom he longed to marry, but that he feared to risk so much on fifteen shillings a week ; with work uncertain at that. Ten thousand dreams held captive a million of dreamers. The cautious dreamt, but did not act. The bolder packed their boxes and made for the nearest port. The desperate, who had gone down, and could not raise their heads in that time of bitter depression, scraped and borrowed and starved to gather the \u00a316 that were needed ; and when that was done, and a passage paid in some crowded steerage, where they slept like a solid cargo, and cooked their own food, and rocked and rolled and pitched through a dreary four months ; when they were once well out on the deep they reckoned their fortunes made, and they spent their idle days in the doldrums speculating as to the castle, the mansion, the park, or the spacious manor they should purchase when a year or so should have brought them back as men of ample fortune. What crowds of dreamers did the three hundred vessels even then afloat contain within their wooden hulls ! What a transcendent mass of visionary wealth were they to be possessed of, those thirty thousand voyagers, then moving all too slowly for their wishes over the ocean in one part or another of their path of twelve thousand miles to the scene of their hoped-for exploits. But not all of them were moved by the zeal for wealth alone. There were many who were stirred by hopes of freedom ; they longed for liberty, and the news of gold made them think of seeking a newer and freer land. The year 1848 had been all over Europe what Justin M'Carthy calls \"the year of unfulfilled revolutions.\" In France, there had been the fall of Louis Philippe ; it set republican hearts in France throbbing. But soon the crafty Napoleon had seized the vacant seat, and France was no republic. In England, the chartists had been filled with rosy hopes of the better times that were to dawn; but ere 185 1, the streak of sunrise that had gilt the clouds had vanished again in the chill gloom. In 1848 the Young Ireland party, foolish perhaps, but high-spirited, and filled with an ardent enthusiasm, had failed in its sanguine expectations, and a clay-cold feeling of disappointment had settled on many hearts that had been warm with hope. In that year of political aspirations there had been insurrections in every part of Europe. Berlin had seen the blood of its citizens redden the trampled snow where the military had ridden in furious charges down the hoarsely resounding streets. Vienna had raised a shout of triumph as its Emperor fled from the palace of his fathers. In Hungary the people were in arms for freedom ; Spain was one fomenting mass of hatred to the dissolute Queen Christina, and fierce intestinal wars were the results of unsuccessful efforts for constitutional freedom. Italy was insurgent from the Alps to the Straits of Messina, and the Pope had fled from Rome. Everywhere there were fierce struggles of the poorly-paid, half-employed, soldier-ridden peoples to better their positions by revolutions. But the time was not yet ready. There were great armies behind the thrones and the patrician privileges. All the power that concentration and organisation give was wielded by the supporters of the existing state of things. It easily crushed the shapeless mass, however vast in extent, that blindly groped for political liberty. The hearts of myriads were sad. For 1850 saw every government practically what it was in 1848. A few unimportant advantages had been gained for popular liberty, but in the main there was no advance. A cheerless gloom had settled on the once ardent reformers as night might gather around a shipwrecked crew, who deemed that they must go down ere ever that night should rise. Then at the end of 1851 and at the beginning of 1852 there came the mails from Victoria, with news that made many a heart beat fast. Where was that land of gold, was the cry ? It was a colony, bright in climate, hopeful in prospects, newly sprung into independence,"], [345, "THE DISCOVERY OF GOLD. -1831 323 with a Constitution free by comparison with any known in Europe. It was a land where the daily wage of the workman exceeded the weekly wage of the toilers in Continental Europe ; and now it was a land where thirty thousand diggers earned on an average twenty pounds a month, or as much as a hard-working man on the Continent of Europe would earn in a year. And besides that, there was a chance for every man of a prize in the lottery. A hundred-weight of gold sticking up out of a hillside ! That was the land for a man to seek who had grown sick of disappointed hope in the three years that had just passed away. And thus all over Europe there were then making themselves ready to depart those ardent thousands \u2014 the busy, the fiery, the energetic, the idealistic spirits \u2014 that have helped so much to make Victoria what it is. They came with hopes far too sanguine to be realised; they had their twinge of disappointment here ; but they survived it. Some returned with the wealth, or part of the wealth, they had dreamt of. Some returned without it. But a very much larger number found the colony after all to their taste, and remained to help it in its upward progress. It was for this that the people of Victoria were waiting in the early months of 1852. In the month of May it began \u2014 a little vanguard of the army that was coming, \u2014 and from that time forward, for many a year, Victoria was to welcome from month to month thousands upon thousands who hailed the rocky cliffs of Cape Otway as the margin of the land of promise, and who could scarce restrain their impetuous impatience when the ship had reached its anchorge in Hobson's Bay among three hundred others till the grating sound had ceased and the cable was duly paid out.

Zhe Era of (Solfc\u2014 1852 to 1855 HE despatches which Latrobe sent to the Colonial Office every month were more picturesque than politic. He delighted in describing the marvels of the goldfields, I but laid too little emphasis on the fact that a trip to the goldfields was like a subscription to a raffle. The man who wins stands out in bold relief; the ten J whose money vanishes and is no more seen are very much in the background. Now, Latrobe gave the average yields in favourable spots, and in favourable weeks ; he gave full details of remarkable discoveries. He constantly reiterated that the goldfields were practically inexhaustible, and that success, moderate at least, if not extraordinary, awaited every man of proper bodily strength and industry who chose to sink his pick into that gold-besprinkled earth. These reports were received with great interest in London. Latrobe was specially thanked for the vividness with which he had described those events of world-wide interest. He purchased for the Queen a beautiful specimen of native gold in its snowy crystals of quartz, and Her Majesty sent him her special thanks, and a message conveying her great interest in the news that came from her youngest colony. All the newspapers in the United Kingdom copied these despatches, which were freely communicated to them by the Colonial Office as a check upon the wild exaggerations of irresponsible rumours. Thence the news spread, little by little, through all Europe and America ; through India and China, and the East Indies. It was a pity that Latrobe was quite so roseate in his descriptions ; for though the facts he stated were facts indeed, and not even so strongly expressed as they might have been, yet by dwelling somewhat too slightly on the background, by yielding too much to the feeling of romance, he shed a glamour over the gold discovery which eventually wrought his downfall. His"], [347, "THE ERA OF GOLD.\u2014 1832 TO 1833. 325 words were official. They were relied on as the absolute truth in ten thousand homes, and tens of thousands of adventurous men, acting upon them, voyaged far from their friends, only to find themselves greatly mistaken. They cast their execrations on the head of the honest, kind-hearted, but impolitic writer of the popular despatches. And truly it was a great stream of people that came, impelled partly by the pressure of hard times at home, partly by the galling of political chains, and partly by the distant glimmer of the golden nuggets. In July of 1852 there came 5000 ; in August, 5400 ; in September, 12,700; in October, 16,000; in November, 14,000; and in December, 14,000. There came, in all, 94,000 persons into the colony during the year. Of these there were 48,000 from neighbouring colonies, of whom 27,000 returned to their homes ; but of the 46,000 who came from Europe less than 800 returned ; thus there was an increase to the population of 66,000 persons ; which, with the additions made during the latter half of 1851, raised the numbers from 77,000 to 168,000 in about a year and a-half. And they came from many a widely distant land. On the 6th March of that year the Argus had published a little poem by Henry Halloran, the gifted writer of Sydney ; an invitation to the poor and suffering of all the earth to come and share the fortune of Australia. \" Australia to the people who groan in every land Would send a friendly greeting, would give a brother's hand, She calls the poor of England, who toil so hard for bread \u2014 Bread scant enough yet salt with tears, the memories of the dead And the poet summoned the disappointed citizens of France, the patriots of Spain, the sadly wakening dreamers of Germany, \"the trampled ones of Italy,\" the \"children of brave Poland.\" \"Come then, ye sufferers of the earth; Australia bids you haste, To make your homes within her wilds, your cities in her wastes.\" And they came. In the five years beginning 1852 there arrived about 100,000 from England, and 4000 from Wales ; 50,000 from Scotland, and 60,000 from Ireland. There came 8000 from Germany, and 1500 from France; while Italy and Spain and Poland and Denmark and Norway and Sweden together sent 5000; the United States contributed 3000 ; China furnished 25,000 of her Tartar labourers, the British colonies scattered abroad sent 3500, and India sent of her dark-skinned races about 300. These mingling crowds raised the population in less than six years from 77,000 to 463,000. Large numbers of these arrivals were disappointed ; and as a rule vented their spleen upon Latrobe. But the great majority found the colony on the whole to their taste. Of the 102,000 persons who came from Europe during 1852 and 1853, only 4000 departed. And yet, though most of these people came out to toil upon the goldfields, many of them found it equally profitable to remain in the towns. There the skilled mechanic was in constant demand at six pounds per week, and the stalwart labourer at three pounds ten. Why, then, should he trouble himself about the goldfields? To the man who never earned fifteen shillings in any week of his life before, a place that offered eight times as much was goldfield enough. So Melbourne grew' with rapid pace. In eighteen months she was converted from a small provincial town of 23,000 people, into a bustling metropolis of over 70,000, and became the largest city of Australasia. Geelong leaped at a bound from 8000 to 20,000; Portland, Warrnambool, Belfast, Kilmore, all felt the impulse, and woke from the sleepy times of pastoral peace, into the excitement, the bustle, the prosperity of the golden fever. But a city which, like Melbourne, was converted from a place of 23,000 inhabitants to one of 70,000 in the space of a year and a-half could not possibly provide house-room for all. At"], [348, "326 VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. the lowest reckoning, such an inundation implied the erection of five thousand houses per annum, and all the mechanics the colony afforded, whether trained or improvised, could not pretend to cope with the demand. Hence the luxurious wages of the tradesman. Hence also the most astonishing increase of rents. A pound a week per room for wooden cottages run up in three days was quite a cheap rate; a decent four-roomed cottage averaged (as official returns still show us) about six pounds per week. And with the enormously increased demand, all things doubled and doubled in price till a loaf of bread was not to be had for less than three shillings, nor a pound of butter for less than four; and every species of provisions was at a similar rate. The inevitable result was a state of lamentable destitution alongside of all the remarkable prosperity of the queen's wharf in 1853-1 colony. The gold-seeker, who had scraped together enough to pay his passage to Melbourne, and who landed with four pounds, perhaps, in his pocket, was practically destitute for the time being. He had shipped for the colonies in utter ignorance of their geography. He probably considered Sydney a place to which he could run over in an afternoon and yet be back before midnight. As for the diggings, he thought he would be practically there when he was at Mel bourne. But he found himself distant an eight days' journey; he learnt that provisions must be paid for at extravagant rates. If he had a box of clothes and a few necessaries to take with him, he found the cost of carrying them to Bendigo to be ,\u00a332 a ton if he came before June 1852, but \u00a360 a ton if he came much later. He probably saw no way of getting to the diggings at all. He stayed a week in town. A boarding-house received him as a favour, it being already crammed from cellar to attic; every room but one was a bedroom, and every floor"], [349, "THE ERA OF GOLD.- 1832 TO 1833. 327 an expanse of improvised beds. The one room not so occupied was a dining-room, used in relays for meals from dawn till midnight; and for that accommodation the lowest sum that any landlady would hear of was three pounds ten shillings per week. Of course the immigrant soon was without money. He proceeded to sell all he could not carry, and started for the goldfields on the chance of managing to walk thither in some way, and to pick up a spade and cradle when there. That was an easy process for the single man, and though sleeping out on the spongy grass through inclement nights sometimes gave rise to a plague of dysentery and fever and rheumatism, yet the single man eventually reached the goldfields, and if he could dodge the police for a week, supposing he had no money for a license, he probably enough began to see his prospects mend. But if he were a married man with a family around him, Melbourne was a terrible place for him to set foot in. He paid fifteen shillings a ton to bring his property from the bay, and a pound for each member of his family. No carter would deign to take his luggage to his temporary home for less than three or four pounds. Five pounds a week for rent, and extraordinary prices for provisions, soon made his slender resources vanish before he could discern how he was to transport his household to the diggings ; for it was in no way a feasible plan to leave them in Melbourne at these ruinous rates while he went off to make a fortune for them. And when his money had abruptly come to an end, he had to turn out into the parks. He had to sell his effects and sleep with his family on the wharves, or under Captain Cole's big shed, or out among the tea-tree scrub. Man)- never reached the goldfields. They accepted work in the towns. But supposing they belonged to trades not specially wanted ; supposing they were weavers, or potters, or cutlers, or skilled in one small branch of some manufacture not known in the colony, they had to accept labourer's work at three pounds ten shillings per week \u2014 work for which they were physically unfit ; yet they had to pay exactly that sum for board and lodging, or if the)' resided in houses they had to pay thirty shillings a week as rent for each room they occupied. It was a time of difficulty from which the energetic, the prudent, the industrious, eventually emerged to float onward on the full tide of the colony's prosperity. But the first pinch was severe. And, unfortunately, there came a great number \u2014 quite a noticeable proportion \u2014 who were neither energetic nor prudent nor particularly industrious. Latrobe, so early as October 1852, asks : \u2014 \" What is to become of the multitudes of decent men of small means and large families ;' decayed or unfortunate tradesmen; half-educated clerks; young men of no decided calling or character, professing their willingness to do anything, without the power of doing anything well ; to say nothing of the horde of weak or irregular characters, whose expatriation has been advocated and assisted by their relatives for the sake of their connections, quite as much as for their own?\" What these people, the unstable and the unthrifty, are to do with little means in a country where the)- will find a sovereign go no further than half-a-crown used to go in the old country, is a problem that Latrobe finds himself unable to solve. But what they did, of course, was mostly to suffer, and there was therefore a vast amount of distress at the very threshold of the land of gold, wherein ninety thousand diggers were gathering fourteen million pounds worth of gold per annum, a rate which yielded four times the average wage to be then obtained in the most favoured European country. The greatest source of difficult)- was clearly the exorbitant rents. Latrobe knew that there were crowds of people sleeping out at nights because they could not pay the rents demanded. But there were at the same time man)- vessels lying idle in the bay for want of crews. He vol. i. 2 y"], [350, "328 VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. chartered two of them ; caused them to be brought close in, and converted them into floating boarding-houses, where sleeping accommodation was granted for five shillings a week, and ship-fare at rates which were not excessive. A private individual took the hint. The captain of the Duke of Bedford, a vessel of some six or seven hundred tons burthen, pulled up to Sandridge pier, and there, as he could not get away for want of a crew, he made an excellent revenue by stowing away some hundreds of m;n every night in his steerage and forecastle at two pounds a week. But these were only trifling expedients, when there were ten thousand new-comers every month, and of these at least three thousand required help for a week or two, while a thousand or more every month were left quite helpless. Latrobe cleaned out the old abattoirs, and crowds made up their beds every night in that unsavoury site. Two or three philanthropic people put large sheds and stores at the disposal of the houseless. But the destitution at last became a matter of urgency, and the Wesleyans of Melbourne commenced a subscription to erect a \" refuge for the homeless.\" They secured the sum of \u00a3\"2000, to which Latrobe added and a shelter was thus provided for several hundreds. But more was wanted ; and yet again that useful hall b2hind the Mechanics' Institute contained an important public meeting to discuss the matter, with William Westgarth in the chair. Mr. William Foster Stawell explained the purpose of the meeting. It was to raise the sum of ten thousand pounds. The Government would give land and roofing materials ; the sum raised by subscription would provide a temporary structure to contain two thousand persons. He said that already the Government, in addition to the abattoir, had given an old barrack, an old depot on Batman's Hill, and had in various ways provided wholesome, though airy, sleeping accommodation for about one thousand two hundred persons. The Wesleyan scheme provided for four hundred more, and the Benevolent Asylum could make room for three hundred ; so that altogether there would be quarters provided for about four thousand persons. But that he considered to be far from sufficient for the necessities of the misguided thousands who landed in Melbourne without a pound in their pockets, and who did not discover till then that in Melbourne they were not at the goldfields. Fawkner, and Langlands, and Johnston, Captain Cole, Mr. Rusden, and others addressed the meeting, and then it was resolved that immediate action should be taken. A committee of eight was formed to gather subscriptions, and the list was handsomely headed by those present. The scheme was carried through, though the public subscribed only ,\u00a33000. The Government gave \u00a36000, and so on the St. Kilda Road, just beyond Prince's Bridge, a long row of wooden buildings was constructed, called the Immigrants' Home. While the people were arriving at the rate of two thousand a week, it gave them accommodation for a week or two, and so allowed them a few days to look about them and determine their future course, without in that short space being stripped of their resources by the exorbitant rents of the colony. Yet even all these efforts did not fully meet the difficulty. There were hundreds who landed with sufficient money to pay for all they required, who yet could not obtain either houses or lodgings, for the simple reason that there were none to be had. Every place was completely occupied; the building trades toiled at their utmost speed, but could not supply a quarter of the dwellings required. It became a perfectly common sight to see tents scattered in all vacant allotments, and in the parks, and even on the quieter suburban streets. There were many objections to that practice in the midst of a city, and Latrobe preferred to assign a definite situation for these frail coverings. The site chosen was that grassy rise between the city and the sea, and known as Emerald Hill. There the new arrival, on payment of five shillings a week,"], [351, "THE ERA OE GOLD.\u2014 1832 TO 1833. 329 CANVAS TOWN, SOUTH MELBOURNE received permission to pitch his tent. Quite a little city there grew up. It was known as Canvas Town. The tents were placed in strict alignment, and streets appeared of goodly length, and from these branched less spacious lanes. Down the central thoroughfare there gathered shops of canvas, and restaurants and boarding-houses, still of canvas. But what a motley place it seemed ; for all cooking and washing, and half the incidents of domestic life, had there to be performed in the open air. And eight thousand people of many nations, all recently landed from ship-life, were gathered there \u2014 the younger son of the English squire, and the negro cook who had absconded from some barque in the bay ; the lady of taste and education, and the loud-voiced slattern from some old world alley \u2014 all were thrown into close proximity. They housed side by side, and mingled in their daily lives on that breezy sward which was the universal back-yard of the whole settlement. At five shillings a tent the weekly receipts were considerable, and the Melbourne Corporation competed for a share by leasing out the two market reserves, one in West Melbourne, the other in East Melbourne, for the same purpose and thus two smaller canvas villages appeared beside the streets of the city. All these presented scenes that were not readily effaced from the mind of the beholder \u2014 scenes of extravagance and of squalor ; of quiet suffering and of noisy vice. Another institution of the time was that sarcastically called \"Rag Fair.\" So regular had become the custom among the immigrants of selling their superfluous property that quite a market was held each forenoon on the southern side of Flinders-street, near the Queen's wharf ; there the costly outfits chosen with much care in the shops of London, the warm wraps which the loving fingers of mothers in Europe had selected for the comfort of their fortune-seeking"], [352, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 330 sons \u2014 the guns, the pistols, the watches, the desks, the trinkets, the books\u2014 all things in short which the immigrant found too cumbersome to take to the diggings, were there ranged upon the ground, while the owners stood behind in long rows ready to take the trifling sums to be had for them from the dealers who frequented this novel mart. What with immigrants arriving and diggers returning to spend the proceeds of their good fortune, Melbourne then presented a most singular aspect. The bay in March 1853 had 138 vessels all recently arrived; in one week of May there came 388S immigrants. The streets became excessively busy in the heart of the city. Ten thousand people there patrolled. Here was the newly-arrived immigrant of the week preceding, who had as yet nothing to do, and there was the successful digger, down for a holiday, with no object on earth but to spend some of his superfluous gold. The Argus of 1852 remarks how picturesque is the grouping on the streets. The bushman in his blue serge shirt, his belt and cabbage-tree hat, was utterly cast into the shade by the Californian who affected a Mexican style \u2014 his showy shirt, his gorgeous scarves, his broad sombrero, his peeping pistols, blending well with his face and hands of wrinkled bronze. The Lascar, the Chinese, the negro, passed and repassed, spending the hours in a ceaseless promenade. In Bourke-street and Elizabeth-street the commotion was great while lines of drays, a quarter of a mile long, against the footpaths were being loaded with boxes, casks, barrels, bales, and packages. The noise of the rolling and crunching wheels, the shouts of bullock drivers to their teams ; the dull murmur of the jostling passers ; the shouts and drunken songs from bar and parlour, from window and balcony of the public-houses ; the din from the auction rooms, where extreme efforts were being carried on in order to make hay while the sun shone ; all blended into one wide roar that filled the streets from ten or eleven in the morning till far on to the evening hours. The little post-office was generally surrounded by a great crowd, and postmaster M'Crae could so little overtake the work of his department that in despair he tumbled the newspapers out into an empty room, or upon the balcony, and let each man scramble for his own. The two banks were held in absolute siege. In a year they had grown from little provincial establishments to places of an amount of business second, it was said, to none in the empire save the Bank of England alone ; and in their slender banking rooms the crush was formidable. One of the humours of the place was what was called the \" digger's wedding.\" Many of them were no weddings at all, the digger having a wife at home, perhaps, and not caring to run his head into danger. But a wedding was the prevalent fashion of treating his friends ; he accordingly went through all the festivities of the occasion with the accommodating goddess who had accepted his invitation to share his gold while it lasted. Many of the weddings were real enough, but in any case they were strange spectacles. The fashion was to celebrate them on Sundays ; the regulation number of carriages was six, all open, and the horses decked with pink rosettes. Lolling in high-born ease were the diggers, each with his \" diggeress,\" as she was called. But the short clay pipe and the black bottle, handed from mouth to mouth, just sufficed to mar the resemblance to the carriage occupants in Hyde Park. The jolly crew paraded all the streets half-a-dozen times over, and as the rival processions defiled past one another the occupants exchanged some humorous oaths or a few indelicate witticisms, and at the fun rolled back on the cushions, the digger in hoarse guffaws, the diggeress in hysterical screams. The proceedings generally terminated with a champagne supper at St. Kilda or Sandridge; and when the hire of a carriage and pair was six pounds a day, when champagne was worth three pounds a bottle for"], [353, "THE ERA OF GOLD.\u2014 1832 TO 1833. 331 the cheapest, it is not surprising to find the cost of these entertainments estimated at from two hundred pounds to a minimum of about one hundred pounds apiece. Fortunately the taste for these spectacles was one that did not outlive the years 1852 and 1853; towards the end of the latter year the incongruous fashion died out. Down by the wharves the roar and traffic on week days made the new arrival wonder if he had ever heard so great a commotion in the heart of the dock district of London. And certainly when he looked about him he saw such a sight as he could not have seen anywhere else. The lighters lined the river banks three abreast, and their cargoes were discharged in a ceaseless stream; the goods could not be removed fast enough by all the cartage facilities within the city, and there they gathered in great heaps. But the strangest feature of it was that a large proportion of these goods was thrown out upon the open ground below the Custom House, without an owner, and there allowed to lie unclaimed. For, soon after the news of the gold discoveries had gone to England, there had gone likewise the news of the prices ruling in Mel bourne. People who could not leave their businesses, still had a terrible itching to share in the golden pie of which the crust had just been broken. They made up consignments of what they thought would sell best; or, often they gathered together whatever they found it impossible to sell in Europe, and shipped it straight for Melbourne, under the strange delusion that anything could there be sold at a remarkable profit. So eager was each of them to be first on the field, that those who knew nothing of the colony, and did not know the names of any of its merchants and very often merely got a glimpse of a Melbourne newspaper, chose the most likely person whose name he there saw in the advertisements or in the reports. To him the goods were consigned and duly shipped. But the Melbourne merchant had been much too smart to let the opportunity slip. He had himself sent home for the goods that would suit the market, and he wanted to make the extra profit for himself. When his stores were crammed and his men unable to overtake the overflowing business they already had, it was no part of his policy to spend time in the poor operation of selling for a commission those most unsuitable goods sent out by his unknown correspondents. So he generally never troubled to look after them. There they lay till at last, on the receipt of inquiries from England, he deigned to send down an auctioneer to dispose of the heterogeneous pile of merchandise. That potentate made quick work of it; to the noisy crowd that gathered he knocked down the articles for a fraction of their original cost. In the year 1853 there came six million pairs of boots, or twenty-four pairs for each person in the colony. Of necessity the great bulk of these were sold for a trifle. All this was as yet unknown in Europe, and still the crowds arrived in numbers that showed no diminution. In 1852 there were 46,000 who came from foreign parts ; in 1853 no less than 56,000 were landed on our shores. But it was otherwise with the stream that came from the neighbouring colonies. In 1852 there came 48,000, but 29,000 returned. In 1853, though only 34,000 arrived, there were 38,000 who departed to the adjacent colonies. At first there was consternation in Sydney, Adelaide, and Hobart. Sir Henry Young, the Governor of South Australia, estimated that 16,000 men had left his colony in the six months ending May 1852, a number that represented more than half the able-bodied men it had contained. Nothing could be done to prevent this exodus, and the politic Governor made the best of the trouble he was unable to cure. He offered \u00a31000 as a reward for the discovery of a payable goldfield in South Australia, and as it would do good to the colony if the gold dug up in Victoria should go to Adelaide for export, he resolved to establish an escort between that city and Castlemaine. In February 1852 he sent his Deputy Surveyor-General, named M'Laren,"], [354, "VLCTORLA AND LTS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 332 with a party of sappers, with drays, bullocks, and horses, to make a practicable route. It was no easy task, for much of the two months' labour was over the waterless tracks of the Western Wimmera territory. But at length it was completed \u2014 a roughly passable road of 338 miles was ready. It made a straight line from the head of Lake Alexandrina to Castlemaine, passing slightly south of Lake Hindmarsh. In June a party of the mounted police of South Australia set out from Mount Alexander on their long trot in charge of the gold which the South Australian miners readily consigned to their care, our i\\ustralian poet, Adam Lindsay Gordon, being one of the escort. In the first three trips this escort took to Adelaide 5 3,44 1 ounces, and a steady stream of gold to the value of over a hundred thousand pounds a month thus poured into that city, and restored to some extent its business and its activity. Moreover, the annual cost of the escort was less than .\u00a36000, while the receipts were .\u00a310,000, arising from a fee of is. 4d. per ounce, which the diggers cheerfully paid in order that the proceeds of their labour might go directly to their homes. Thus the public revenue benefited; and as Young established an assay office, which also yielded a reasonable profit, he seemed to have greatly lessened the evil results to the colony. But it was a goldfield to themselves that the South Australians wanted, and the reward offered sent many a competitor prospecting over the face of the country. A man named Chapman at length found gold at Echunga, twenty-two miles from Adelaide and two miles beyond the Onkaparinga. For six or seven months the district was laboriously pierced \u2014 at one time there were four hundred at work \u2014 but though gold was found it was too thin to yield a decent return for the time it absorbed, and in April 1853 the field was abandoned as being unprofitable. But by that time great numbers of the South Australian diggers had cither gone back to invest their profits, or had returned disgusted with their ill-fortune. Meantime the gold escort continued. South Australia, indeed, maintained a special commissioner at Bcndigo for the convenience of its people. He was subordinate to Latrobe, was paid by him, and complied with all Victorian regulations. But all expenses were refunded to the Victorian Government by that of South Australia. Had all the arrivals from the neighbouring colonies been of the same class as those that came from Adelaide \u2014 as orderly, respectable, and law-abiding \u2014 Victoria would have been saved much trouble. But the gold fever attracted a most undesirable crowd from New South Wales and Tasmania. All the ex-convicts, all the ticket-of-leave men, and many escaped prisoners were among the thousands that came monthly from these colonies; and a gaol-bird aspect was commonly noticed in the bundle-carrying visitors that stepped ashore at Sandridge. Square of jaw, shaggy in the eye-brows, low in the forehead, with strongly marked bumps beneath the close-cropped hair, their very appearance was a source of alarm to the respectable citizens. Many of these found no inducement to take them out of Melbourne. The foolish diggers who came to town laden with gold, and who then made themselves drunk, were an excellent goldfield to these old professionals who, many of them, with the aid of a little garroting, gathered large sums with no great trouble. An official return sent to Latrobe by the police shows an astonishing amount of cash and gold as having been found on the persons of men arrested during the latter months of 1852. If these sullen-looking fellows got out upon the road they found an amount of wealth travelling backwards and forwards which tempted them to remain upon the road. Parties of ten to sixteen spent their time prowling up and down, plundering tents in the absence of their owners, pilfering, cheating, and setting traps for the lucky but foolish digger on his way to town. A favourite practice of theirs was horse-stealing. Not a horse could be allowed to wander a hundred yards from the encampment of the carrier or of the travelling party who spent the night"], [355, "THE ERA OF GOLD.\u2014 1832 TO 1833. 333 by the road. A horse taken to the diggings was an everlasting care to its owner. On one morning in April 1853, the Argus contained no less than twelve columns of advertisements for stolen horses.' Mr. Redmond Barry, who was raised to the bench in 1852, signalised the commencement of his judicial functions by strongly calling public attention to the frightful evils this flood of convictism was causing to the colony. In October 1852, when opening the first criminal sessions at Castlemaine, he pointed out that in the previous three months there had been sixty-six of these people tried in Victoria for serious offences, and that this was but a small proportion of the number that ought to have been arrested had the police force been of its proper strength. But the evil was patent enough. Every man who had property on the goldfields lay down to sleep in imminent danger of his life. It was the custom for storekeepers, when they laid themselves on their stretchers at night, to keep two or three candles burning around them and their fire-arms laid out in convenient array. A large number of the meaner sort of convict visitors became \"fossickers\"; they watched by day the holes where gold was being gathered most abundantly, and at midnight they visited the spot in a band to carry off the auriferous earth in bags in order that they might wash it at their leisure on the morrow. And if the owner of the claim detected them, they scrupled little to silence him with a blow or a shot. In September 1852 Latrobe reports that several large bands of bushrangers are busy on the main roads. They have spies to warn them of the approach of the police, whereupon they scatter up into the woody ranges, to sally out on some other part and rob the passers. But merely to harass the outskirts of the roads would not satisfy some of these folks, though sometimes a single man's share of booty amounted to as much as a thousand pounds a month. They became more daring in their aspirations. During the night of 2nd April, 1852, two boats, loaded with twenty-two of these ex-convicts, sailed from Sandridge with muffled oars. They reached the barque Nelson, which was lying three miles out upon the bay. The captain was ashore, as they well knew, and no watch was being kept. They silently boarded the barque, in the broad moonlight, some of them with crape or black handkerchiefs over their faces. Having entered the forecastle, they surprised and secured two men and a boy, who were sleeping there, while a detachment descended to the cabin, where were the mate and three others. Some shots were fired, and the mate was wounded ; but the odds were too great, the four men were soon secured. Then the robbers deliberately threw overboard all the fire-arms and the swivel gun of the barque. They next made a search for the gold which they knew was on board, and passed down the boxes with Si 53 ounces into the boats. They then returned with muffled oar, leaving all on board still bound. They beached their boats near St. Kilda, where they had a dray waiting for the gold. This was only the most glaring of several audacious robberies that had taken place, and it woke the community to resentment. Next day a public meeting was called. It assembled, as usual, in the Mechanics' Institute. Among the speakers were Fawkner, Kerr, David Blair, Westgarth, Henty, Stevenson, Nicholson, and Captain Harrison, who asked how long was Victoria to be plagued by this stream of villainy ? Was the colony that had kept itself clear of the stain of convictism to be afflicted with the accumulated felonry of all the colonies ? A resolution was adopted that Victoria should protest against this danger to her peace and to her reputation ; and another expressed the determination to resist by every means the further influx of convicts. There was a difficult)- in the way of dealing with these men. Many of them were absolutely free, having completed their sentences ; others possessed tickets-of-leave, which gave 1 Howitt's \" Two Years in Australia,\" p. 199."], [356, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS : PAST AND PRESENT. 334 them a legal right to go where they chose in Australia, though it did not permit them to return to the British Isles. Now Victoria had recently offered a stout and successful resistance to the entrance of this very class of people within her boundaries. Three times, indeed, had she to fight the battle, and three times did she win it. The first occasion has already been described, when Earl Grey sought to force the \"Pentonvillers\" on the colony in 1844. Then the cargo of the Royal George had been landed ; but in face of the determined opposition shown by the colonists, the Minister had yielded and sent no more. But, four years later, Earl Grey had made a second attempt. Free immigration had then, in 1848, almost wholly ceased. The colony was certainly in want of labour ; England was loth to abandon the system of sending out her less hardened criminals to new lands where they might have a chance, if they chose, to lead decent lives apart from old associations and old temptations. He had therefore obtained from the Queen-in-Council an order directing the transportation to the colonies of ticket-of-leave men who had served a portion of their sentences. In the beginning of 1849 the people of Melbourne had held a great meeting, addressed by O'Shanassy, Fawkner, Kerr, Richard Heales, and others. Resolutions had been carried condemning the proposed introduction of convicts, and asserting that the attempt to force these people on the colony was a distinct breach of faith with the thousands of free immigrants who had come thither on the express understanding that Port Phillip was not to be a convict colony. A meeting of magistrates was subsequently held to urge the Governor not to admit these felons if they should reach the shores of the colony. On the 8th of August, 1849, the Randolph approached Port Phillip Heads with the first detachment of the promised host. Instructions were then transmitted to him that he was to go on to Sydney, where it was understood that Governor Fitzroy was not averse to the reception of convicts. The captain declined to comply. It was for Melbourne his vessel had been chartered, and to Melbourne he would go lest he should incur the risk of losing his insurance. When the ship cast anchor in Hobson's Bay, and it was known that the convicts were preparing to come ashore, a very excited feeling prevailed in Melbourne and there seemed to be some likelihood of a violent explosion, perhaps of bloodshed, if the captain insisted on landing the men. Latrobe in that crisis took the responsibility of re-charter ing the Randolph, paying the captain .\u00a3500 to proceed to Sydney. There they were received without difficulty, the authorities being all favourable to their admission ; but the transaction was completed quietly and with speed ; when the people came to know of it, they did not regard it with much satisfaction. For in truth all the colonies appear to have been hostile to Earl Grey's plan. They had all been informed that transportation to their shores had been discontinued ; it was a breach of faith to send thither convicted felons on the pretext that they were not sent as a punishment, but only for reformation. Tasmania, in especial, which had rejoiced to have been at last freed from the moral sewerage that had so long been cast upon her shores, offered to join hand-in-hand with Port Phillip in resisting the new attempt. The Rev. John West, a minister in Launceston, was the originator of what was called the \" Australasian League.\" He and another delegate crossed to Melbourne in the early part of 185 1. William Nicholson, who was then the mayor of Melbourne, Dr. Thomson, the mayor of Geelong, William Westgarth, and William Bell, became the delegates for Victoria. At a meeting of these delegates, together with other influential citizens, held in Melbourne, it was resolved to form the \"Australasian League,\" all the members of which should undertake to employ no person sent to the colonies under sentence of transportation; to agitate for the repeal of the"], [357, "THE ERA OF GOLD.- 1832 TO 1833. 335 obnoxious regulations ; and to support with money and assistance any who should suffer through being prominent in the cause of anti-transportation. A somewhat significant fact followed the inauguration of the league. A new banner, well known since then as the flag of Australia, was unfurled, and saluted with ringing cheers. It was a deep blue flag with the Union Jack in the corner, but with its azure-tinted field marked with five white stars to represent the Southern Cross. It was a delicate hint ; but the constitution stated that \" The object of the league is to secure by moral means only the abolition of transportation to the Australian colonies.\" The conference issued an address to the colonists of Australia, and another to the inhabi tants of the United Kingdom. It held a great meeting on the 1st of February, 1851, in the Queen's Theatre. An ardent feeling of enthusiasm prevailed, and more than five thousand pounds was subscribed at once for the purposes of the league; no less than thirty-five persons gave a hundred guineas each, and forty others gave sums exceeding twenty pounds. Stirring speeches were made by Nicholson and Moor and Stawell; by Westgarth and West and Bell; by Dr. Greeves and Heales and Fawkner. Three resolutions were carried with loud acclamations, the assembly pledging themselves to use every peaceful means in their power to resist Earl Grey and his measure. The mayor called for three cheers for the Queen, which were heartily given, and the meeting broke up. If Earl Grey intended still to persist in his policy, he must have been made aware by the strong feeling and fervour of this meeting, and by the deep deter mination of another held in St. Patrick's Hall a fortnight later, how earnest, how solemn was the antagonism he would have to overcome in the colonies.\" A second shipment of convicts landed at Sydney Cove alarmed the people of New South Wales, who bitterly reproached their Legislative Council and their Governor for having accepted the unwelcome arrivals. The feeling in Sydney ran very high. In deference to it the Legislative Council passed a resolution praying Earl Grey to send no more convicts. That nobleman had tried a shipload at Cape Colony. There the people had refused to receive them, and sent them on to Tasmania, where the Governor accepted them amid the deep execration of the people. Meantime letters, despatches, reports, petitions, protests, had been interchanged in great numbers, enough to fill a goodly volume of House of Commons papers. The feeling' of the English Parliament was on the whole one of sympathy for the colonies, and Earl Grey gave way in a somewhat sullen fashion. He offered no explanation, but in future sent convicts only to Brisbane and to Western Australia. Thus, when Victoria became an independent colony on the 1st of July, 1851, the battle was won. She was not to be the receptacle of any part of the felonry of Great Britain ; there was a general congratulation, when suddenly the gold discoveries upset the calculations of the rejoicers, for Victoria became the point on which all the convict population already in Australia was precipitated. Most of these men came to work in a quiet and orderly manner on the diggings, but there was a formidable proportion of incurable ruffians. A visitor like Martin Cope, the notorious bushranger of Tasmania, kept the small police force in hot water whilst they followed his movements up and down the country to observe where he was likely to break out into lawless ways. Hence the feeling in Victoria took a fresh shape. Twice it had fought against the entrance of convicts sent directly from England. Now it had to resist their entrance from the other colonies. A bill, called the \"Convicts' Prevention Act,\" was passed at the close of 1852, and assented to by Latrobe in February 1853, whereby it was enacted that no man who was not '-' Pamphlet : \" Inauguration of the Australasian League.\" Melbourne, 1851.

Shillinglaw, Esq."], [359, "THE ERA OF GOLD.\u2014 1852 TO 1835. 337 actually free should be permitted to land in Victoria. Those who held tickets-of-leave were supposed to be at liberty to go where they pleased, so long as they did not go to England. But this Act declared that, wherever else they might go, they were not to come to Victoria. Any ship captain introducing to the colony a person whom he knew to be a runaway convict, or a man with only a conditional pardon, was to be fined one hundred pounds, and as the Act was strictly carried out and heavy fines levied, the process that had occasioned so much dis satisfaction was at once checked. The English Government, however, received this measure with some disapprobation. What right had a colony like Victoria to interfere with the Royal prerogative of pardon ? What authority had it to alter the terms of an Imperial regulation ? The Queen was advised to refuse her assent. The bill was sent back, and the colonial legislature directed to strike out some of the clauses. Latrobe accordingly prepared and submitted to his Legislative Council a new bill, drawn up with the objectionable portions left out. But neither the Council nor the people would tolerate any alteration. There had been some glaring outrages quite recently, and public feeling was just then peculiarly strong. On the 20th of July, 1853, a gold escort from Heathcote, on the M'lvor diggings, had been attacked and robbed under audacious circumstances. Eleven of these convict fellows had formed an ambuscade on a narrow part of the road just beyond the crossing-place of the Campaspe. On one side there was a high bank with dense scrub, on the other the bushrangers erected a screen of boughs and foliage. As the horses carrying the gold came on, with three troopers riding on each side, a volley suddenly rang from the leafy screen, and four of the troopers fell from their horses. The other two replied to the fire of the robbers from a distance till their ammunition was spent ; they then turned and spurred their horses to seek assistance. Meanwhile the robbers had secured the gold, about two hundredweights, valued at over \u00a3\"8000. The news was in Heathcote in less than an hour. Three hundred armed diggers were soon scouring the country, but without success; the robbers were well away into the ranges. Subsequently, however, five of the ringleaders were arrested, of whom one committed suicide, and three were executed. The troopers all recovered, though the bushrangers had left them as dead, one miscreant indeed having placed his pistol against the breast of a fallen man as he lay moaning, and shot him through the lungs. About the same time the career of O'Connor and Bradley likewise attracted attention. These worthies were ticket-of-leave holders in service near Launceston. They took to the bush, and called at a house they wished to plunder, each with a double-barrelled gun. They tied up all the inmates they could capture and thrust them into the bedroom of the young ladies of the house. The proprietor of the place, however, succeeded in escaping to give the alarm. They fired at him as he was getting over a fence, but missed him. They then returned, and putting the muzzle of a gun against the neck of the only other gentleman of the place, fired into it, leaving the man shattered and weltering in death at the feet of the horror-stricken ladies. They plundered the place and passed on, robbing as they went, and shooting a constable on their way, their main idea, however, being the hope of crossing to Victoria. For that purpose they proceeded to Circular Head, where the schooner Sophia was lying. They signalled to be taken aboard. The master, suspecting nothing, sent a boat for them. When on deck they suddenly levelled their guns, one standing close to the captain. As those on deck had no arms they had to submit to the indignity of having their hands tied. The rest of the crew were one by one called from below and also tied up. The two desperadoes then explained that they were \" lifers,\" with conditional pardons; that they were striking for full liberty; that they were going to release the"], [360, "338 VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. crew again, but that one of them would constantly stand by the captain in order to blow his brains out at the least sign of deviation from their orders. Under this compulsion the crew weighed anchor and the schooner set sail against the strong protest of the captain, who said the weather was so heavy that she could not be expected to cross the surf at the bar. The vessel, as he expected, lost steerage way among the breakers, drifted ashore, and stranded. There she lay for a day while a crowd gathered on shore, who fired occasional shots at the two robbers on board. But the distance was too great, and meantime the ruffians compelled the crew to throw all the cargo overboard, when with the rising tide the schooner floated off again, and the captain headed her for Port Phillip, one or other of the felons standing all the time with the muzzle of his gun ready for the captain's head. So they reached Cape Schanck, where the two of them took a boat and sailed for shore along with two seamen. The boat and the seamen were not again heard of, but Bradley and O'Connor most certainly were. They first visited the house of a Mr. Balcombe; they plundered it, but shed no blood. Then they proceeded to the outskirts of Brighton, entered the house of a Mr. King, tied him up as well as his son, and asked where the horses were, as they wanted a pair for future operations. The son went as guide to show them where their only horses were being used for ploughing. On coming up with the ploughman they ordered him to take the horses out. He thinking it a joke, said he was busy just then, they could come again after dinner. They at once shot him and left him mortally wounded. Mounting the horses they rode off to commence business on the Kilmore road. There they robbed in a cool and impudent manner, and if any one provoked them in an)' way they shot him without mercy. Of course the police were soon upon their tracks; but they were cunning and active. At Clunes and at Gisborne they had been all but caught, but it was at Kilmore that the fight took place. On a station there they had tied up seven men, shot one dead, and shot at two others who escaped. The police arrived soon after. The ruffians were almost surprised, but shot two of the police, of whom one died subsequently. They then dashed off at full speed, the troopers after them. The robbers contrived to escape, and had the coolness towards midnight to enter a tent near the road, tie up the sleepers, and plunder the property. But it was their last exploit. As the)' rode away the police again caught sight of them. There was a three miles' chase, and then the outlaws turned to bay. They fired and slightly wounded one of the attacking party, six in number. After a considerable amount of firing, which in the darkness took no effect, the two robbers were secured. The)' were both hanged, accepting death with a vulgar levity and cheap bravado. These were the worst specimens of a bad class. But while it was known that nine thousand convicts had entered the colony in eighteen months, including a fair proportion of demons from Norfolk Island, the general feeling was one of exasperation, and the people were not likely to submit tamely to the alteration of the law that was to protect them from this influx ot ruffians. The Council again passed the \" Convicts' Prevention Act \" without change. Latrobe, placed in a difficult corner, withheld his assent, leaving the bill for the consideration of the Queen. But there was a clause in the Constitution Act which provided that, unless Her Majesty formally signified her disapproval within two years of the passing of a bill which had been assented to by a Governor, it thereby became law. The British Cabinet silently let the victory pass to the side of the colonists. Pier Majesty never signified her disapproval ; the bill, having been originally assented to by Latrobe, had the force of a temporary law, and at the expiration of the two years it ranked as a statute of the colony. Its effects were good, and so satisfactory that a year or two later South Australia also placed an almost identical act on its statute book"], [361, "THE ERA OF GOLD.\u2014 1852 TO 1833. 339 without protest from the English authorities. An increased police force assisted the operation of the Victorian Act in restoring good order. In January 1853 the colony had 875 constables; in June of the same year it had 1589. That increase, together with the infliction of a fine of \u00a3100 each on careless captains who brought over convicts, soon made a vast difference in the aspect of the colony. But it was perhaps a pity that Victoria had occasion at that time to come even slightly into collision with the Imperial authorities, for she had just been the recipient of a graceful concession on the part of Her Majesty's Government. A despatch of Sir John Pakington's, dated 2nd June, 1852, renounced all claim on the part of the Empire to the gold fund or to the land fund of the colony. To our ears in the present day this sounds like no great concession. But when, up to that time, had any nation waived all pecuniary claims on its colonies? Had not colonies always been regarded as existing solely for the benefit of the mother country ? England, for the first time in the world's history, had in part entered on this new policy about fifteen years before. She had then ceased to have an)* pecuniary interest in the Australian colonies, but she still retained control of their land revenue, though spending it for their benefit. The Crown also had still a legal claim to a royalty on all minerals found in the colonies, which, at the rate of only one per cent., would have been worth per annum in Victoria. All such revenues were handed over unconditionally to the colonv, to be expended under the direction of the Legislative Council. On 7th September, 1852, the Speaker of the Council transmitted to Sir John Pakington the thanks of that bod)- for \"the kind and conciliator)- tone\" of his despatch, which it regarded as being calculated to \"foster and encourage those feelings of loyalty and attachment to the Crown and institutions of the mother country with which it is so desirable that the minds of Her Majesty's distant subjects should be imbued.\" The concession of full and unrestricted control over the gold fund was perhaps no more than justice, but when accompanied by kind words and a courteous manner it gave much satis faction to the colon)-. It was a matter of no little value at a time when the yearly yield of gold exceeded a hundred and seventy tons, and when the total proceeds of less than eight years amounted in value to over a hundred millions of pounds. At the end of 1853 there were 75,000 persons on the goldfields; in June 1854 the number had increased to 116,000; but at the end of that year it diminished to 92,000, through the departure of many who, though fairly successful, had discovered that in the general work of the community there were various openings for them that offered greater profit. Next year, however, it had recovered, and stood at the large total of 125,000. For the first two years the population of the goldfields was a very inconstant one. A rumour passed from mouth to mouth, and in an hour some hundreds of tents were struck, and a long procession was on its way to the magic spot that formed the latest source of excitement. From day to day the remainder would toil as usual, but by degrees the)- would yield to the fever of speculation, and depart by tens and twenties and fifties, only to come straggling back again in a week or two perhaps. But some of these new places were of more permanent value. In November 1852 the \"rush\" to the Ovens was at its height, and twelve or fifteen thousand people were gathered there before the end of the year. Gold was first discovered on the Ovens itself near Wangaratta, but there was no excitement attached to the discovery. But on the May Day Hills, a little further east, gold was discovered in April 1852, and these lonely granitic ranges soon began to be populous. The yield from Reid's Creek created some excite-"], [362, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 340 ment in the colony; but the discovery of better ground at Spring Creek, still in the same district, caused a great current of miners, many of them from New South Wales, to set in towards the Ovens Valley. Within ten days of the opening of the Spring Creek mines there were many thousands on the ground, and Latrobe sent up two commissioners, with ten troopers ; a party of foot police followed, and a Government camp was formed in the May Day Hills, the first foundation of the pretty town of Beechworth. William Howitt has left us a vivid description of the scene. He reached the diggings at Christmas time, with his two sons, one of them being Alfred W. Howitt, the well-known geologist and police magistrate of Sale. On reaching the brow of a hill' they looked down into a gently sloping valley filled with tents. Through the middle ran a broad strip, over which all the earth had been turned up, till it looked like a desert of pale clay. Dusty ground, fallen trees, deep wells half-filled with water, and accompanied by their heaps of clay, surrounded a dirty little stream called Spring Creek, with rows of men washing their tin dishes and their cradles into the trickling current. With rude windlasses, a crowd of men on the hillside were hauling up buckets of earth from holes of thirty feet in depth ; but most of the work was done in holes of ten or twelve feet in the bed of the creek. These were partly filled with water, which soaked through from the creek. It was black as ink, and smelt like a tan yard, by reason of the bark of the timber used to keep the sides from falling in. One digger spent his time in bailing out this stench-breeding stream, while a second scooped up the sand from the bottom and passed it overhead to be puddled ; watchful eyes were intent to see where the golden results were best, and when a nugget came up, or a pound of dust came out of a single dish, a hundred diggers abandoned the holes they were in and a rush of men with spades and picks took place to open up claims as near as possible to the lucky one. Each of them, with his eight feet square marked out, began to sink his pit until he reached the level of the waters, and then came toil and trouble, when he had to brace up the walls with timber and throw out the water with pannikins and buckets. It was a terribly rough and dirty occupation, but there in these pits were hundreds of men well-born and liberally educated cheerfully toiling like galley-slaves. Undoubtedly there was a great deal of gold to be found in the Beechworth district; as much as 13,000 ounces often left by the weekly escort, but there were no instances of very surprising good fortune. These diggings proved permanent, and in the course of 1853 the township of Beechworth was laid out, and land was freely bought by storekeepers. In the early part of that year several secondary fields in the same neighbourhood were opened. The clear waters of the Yackandanda Creek no longer murmured through their romantic valley in the quiet seclusion which for so many ages they had made musical. A miner named Braidy had stolen away from Spring Creek, and found the golden grains well sprinkled in the sands which lay beneath the sward in that mountain valley, shaded by huge gum trees, white and red and blue. At the close of 1853 another rush took place. An American, named Pardoe, had found a promising spot sixty miles away, in a wild, romantic mountain gorge, yet he had only ten days of it to himself ere the stream of diggers began. It was a region quite inaccessible for vehicles, and indeed for horses also. It lay up among the Buffalo Mountains, where the River Buckland broke from the confinement of its precipitous gorge. Even where the diggings were formed there was no room for working except in the actual bed of the creek, and even that did not always allow the digger his regulation width of eight feet. But when it was rumoured that the average gains of the first comers were nearly fifty pounds a day, up the diggers tumbled, hauling their tents, their beddings, their imple- :l \" Two Years in Victoria,\" p. 118."], [363, "THE ERA OF GOLD.\u2014 iS 32 TO 1833 341 ments, with incredible labour over boulders, blocks of granite and heavy logs, till in a month there were five thousand of them occupying thirty miles of the creek ; and at New Year 1854, Latrobe reports that the rush was still continuing. At Easter, however, it had fallen off. The want of provisions, the prevalence of dysentery, had driven back the army of diggers, even though the rumour ran that there still was plenty of gold to be had. A few wanderers had crossed Mount St. Bernard and found gold at Omeo, whither a smaller rush had taken place ; but it soon died away, the difficulties of access being so great that nothing but an extraordinary field of gold would induce the miners to undergo the privations necessary. That spot where Chapman, the mysterious shepherd, had asserted some years ago that he had discovered gold, had during these times of excitement become a source of interest to the dwellers of the district. Brentani's party had found gold, but not enough to repay the labour of getting it. The neighbours, however, were now disposed to think he had been too hasty, and they kept a watch for favourable indications ; in August 1852 a labourer and his son gathered sixteen pounds weight of gold, worth .\u00a3800, by merely stripping the surface of the soil close to what had been Chapman's hut. The result was a rush to the spot, and the diggings \"broke out\" that were then known as the Daisy Hill diggings, on the site were the town of Amherst was subsequcntly surveyed. But a more popular rush took place three or four months later to Mount Korong, and then to Mount Kerang. In December 1852, when a commissioner and constable galloped thither to take charge, they reported that about three thousand diggers filled the road between Sandhurst and Korong. The rush was of no great duration, for though gold was found with ease, lying on the surface in lumps of great beaut)-, embedded in crystals of quartz, yet it was soon all gathered, and the disappointed crowds spread out. In February of 1853 the diggers were wandering south from Mount Korong and north from Daisy Hill. They met at what was called Jones's Creek, where now stands the town of Dunolly, and all the surrounding district being found of considerable richness, a great number scattered out over all the country from Maryborough to Inglewood. In February gold was found at Mount Moliagul close to Jones's Creek, and a rush took place, but the season being very dr)', and the streams shrunken, the miners were forced to withdraw. In July, however, a dray passing over the ground near the Mount cutting into the boggy soil with its wheel, revealed rich deposits of gold below ; then the rush began afresh ; the first party that arrived gathered over twenty pounds weight in two days, and ere a week was over 3500 persons were there collected. It never became a place where \"diggings\" in the orthodox fashion were carried on. It was devoted to \"nugget-hunting.\" With pick and pocket-knife the miners examined the soil, getting small pieces from time to time, to keep up their spirits, and if these began to flag the rumour that some one had found a nugget worth a hundred, two hundred, occasionally five hundred or a thousand pounds, kept all up to tension. And so Mount Moliagul was the savoured goldfield for a time till other attractions drew the diggers away; after some months a handful only were left at a place which was regarded as worked out. How bitter the tricks that fortune plays ! From that very district, in after days, many a handsome deposit of gold was unearthed, and there it was that the biggest nugget the world has ever seen was pierced, fifteen years later, by the pick of the lucky Cornishman. The \" Welcome Stranger,\" weighing two hundredweights, and worth .\u00a310,000, was dug out of a little hill to the west of Mount Moliagul. It cropped out of the hill side in that district which for fifteen years had been more or less frequented by diggers. Mean while, in these early times, the whole county of Talbot and the southern part of Gladstone became filled with little mining townships: Inglewood and Wedderburn, at Mount Korong; Dunolly,"], [364, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLLS PAST AND PRESENT. 342 Tarnagulla, Moliagul, around Jones's Creek ; Maryborough, Carisbrook, Amherst, Talbot, and so on, round Daisy Hill; and smaller townships joined this district to Clunes and Creswick, and so to Ballarat. This latter place had for a time been very quiet. At the beginning of 1852 it had only a few hundred miners. In September there were a thousand, obtaining only moderate but steady yields. The prevalent opinion was that the place was worked out, but it was regarded as a central town for all those scattered diggings that lay for fifty miles all around. Hence in the middle of 1852 a township was surveyed opposite Golden Point, once so busy with diggers, now mainly frequented by storekeepers. The diggers who were still at work were men who had taken to mining as their trade; they built huts, or even weatherboard dwellings; they erected fences and enclosed little yards wherein they could secure some privacy. They gathered their wives and families around them, and were tempted by no new rushes, content to earn a steady wage by steady toil. But in the month of May, a medical man resident among the diggers found gold in quantity at a gully two or three miles away. He called it the Eureka Gully, and thither came diggers from other districts, till in a few months it had over six thousand people in it. Latrobe, who visited it in November, was wholly surprised by its aspect. For two miles the gully was occupied by busy miners, who raised as much as 10,000 ounces a week, or a return of nearly seven pounds sterling per man. One nugget was found of the value of \u00a3450, and a party of four men deposited at the escort office, as the result of a week's work, an amount worth about eleven hundred pounds. In the following February all that had ever yet been done in the way of gold-mining was eclipsed by the operations in Canadian Gully. That hollow had been called after a Canadian named Swift, who first opened a claim there in September 185 1.' For a year and more it was worked with varying success to shallow depths. But in February a party named Evans, Lees, and Green, carried their shafts down to about seventy feet, and were rewarded with the largest nugget known until that time. It weighed 1619 ounces, and by its side lay a smaller companion of sixty-five ounces. It was a pleasant morning's work, worth nearly six thousand pounds. Immediately afterwards, Bristow, Sully, and Gough went down also, and on reaching the same stratum were rewarded with a pair of plums equally engaging to the sight. One weighed 11 18 ounces, and the other 1005. 5 They made together a value of \u00a37500, and assisted in raising the reputation of the Canadian Gully. Their neighbours immediately began also to sink deeper, and Joyce and Welsh also came upon a pair of golden prizes, one weighing 368, the other 144 ounces, worth about \u00a31600. Before long there were again 8200 miners in Ballarat, all anxious for a corner in this rich Canadian Gully, from which hundreds of smaller nuggets of varying value were daily drawn. But these were now no longer mere adventurers; they brought with them 3150 women and 3100 children, making for Ballarat a total of 14,450 people; and as their dwellings were somewhat more substantial than tents, Ballarat began to assume the aspect of a city. Then came the wonders of Little Bendigo Gully, and Sailor's Gully, and Dead Horse Gully, exceeded in August by the Prince Regent's Gully, where the miners, on descending from sixty to hundred feet, entered a thin bed of tough clay that had all the appearance of solid gold, so thickly was it mixed with dust and little nuggets. A party of eight men took out in a few weeks very little less than \u00a38000 worth of gold. Then in the carl)- part of 1854 the Gravel Pits Lead was opened out with famous results, and Ballarat once more took rank as the richest goldfield of the world. By the middle of that 'Withers, 69. --Eatrobe's despatches, 2nd March, 1853."], [365, "THE ERA OF GOLD.\u2014 1852 TO 1833. 343 year the population had doubled, there being 27,500 people there, including 4700 women and 4100 children. And these people now mostly lived in a regular city, which had its streets of houses, though still much intermingled with tents. There were churches visible, and theatres, and shops of every sort, many of them spacious establishments. The diggers went out to their work in the neighbouring gullies, one mile, two miles, or three miles away, and returned at even ing to their homes in the township, thus saving themselves the discomfort of living among holes and heaps of clay. Two years more and Ballarat was a handsome city, with mile after mile of properly made streets, with six banks, a newspaper, a hospital, and a coaching office, with extensive stables. This latter establishment belonged to a Mr. Cobb, a man whose name is familiar in the colonies, and whose enterprise was a prominent factor in the history of these times. He was a Californian who arrived in 1852, and about the middle of that year organised a service of coaches to the goldfields. He brought some capital with him, purchased the best of horses, imported American coaches of the smartest model, and with them imported still smarter Yankee drivers. Good horses, strong coaches and experienced drivers were needed on THE \"GREAT LEVIATHAN\" COACH.' those terrible roads ; the traveller, if the weather was a little wet, could only get a mile from Melbourne before he had a taste of what was coming. There, where the Haymarket now stands,\" the two roads branched, that to the right going to the M'lvor and Ovens diggings along the Sydney road, that to the left leading through Flemington and so to Mount Alex .ander. There was the first \"glue-pot\" where many a party, after tugging and pushing at their drays for an afternoon, were content to take their horses out as evening fell, and then to camp all night where now is the University reserve, trusting to get the loan of other animals in the morning. And when the bounding coaches had struggled through a quarter of a mile of clay deep enough to cover the axles, they faced a road in formidable condition. Where it was unfenced the straggling vehicles had spread out over a mile or more of width, each seeking firm ground ; where it was enclosed the whole of the tumultuous traffic was narrowed into a thirty feet width. There, dead bullocks and horses, and the debris of carts that had come to pieces, bore witness to the severity of the toil that was necessary to pass upon an unmade road where already a hundred thousand vehicles had passed. In the year 1853 Latrobe spent \u00a3300,000 in setting the roads to the diggings in good order, and from the end of 1854 they were as \" This famous Coach, owned by Cobb and Company, ran between Geelong and Ballarat before the railway was constructed. It was built to accommodate 72 passengers, but has frequently carried 100 persons. Vol. I. 2 S"], [366, "344 VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. excellent as any that could anywhere be seen. But it was while the roads were still in their condition of alternate bogs and bumpy miles of out-cropping boulders that Cobb made himself a blessing to the colony. His line of coaches was admirably equipped for this rough work, but he received handsome fares, and in two years' time had acquired a fortune, when he sold out his interest and returned to America. His presence was, therefore, but of short duration, but his name long lingered, as a favourite word, and when the roads were mended and the coaches bowled over them with easy smoothness, a line of \" Cobb's Coaches \" was laid on to many a place that Cobb had never seen, and which Cobb never as much as heard of. But in 1853 and 1854 Cobb was a name of power on all the goldfields, and every miner in Ballarat kept a look-out for the coach with the four galloping horses that dashed madly past the rows of wooden shops and dwellings on its final spurt to deliver the mails in good time.' Close to Ballarat there began to spring up the town of Creswick in the course of 1853. It received its name from Creswick's Creek, where it was situated, not far from the fine house wherein Captain Hepburn now resided, a man of ample means and abundant comfort. The diggings at first attracted about 5000 persons, who generally succeeded fairly well in claims of thirty or forty feet in depth, though with no sensational results. Castlemaine, some twenty miles further on, had seen strange vicissitudes of fortune in these earlier years. At the beginning of 1852, when it was known as Forest Creek, it was thronged with multitudes as an ant-hill with ants, and at once in a central part the nucleus of a town began. Some refreshment tents were opened ; then a hut was erected for the sale of vegetables, a post-office rose, and tents for a druggist's, a barber's, and a grocer's shop.8 A hut arose for an Argus office ; others for eating-houses ; a rude erection contained the horses of the enterprising Cobb; four coaches a day entered and four dashed out of the busy place. By degrees the tents were replaced with weatherboard buildings, and when the Government laid out the township of Castlemaine, better buildings began to appear here and there on land which the storekeepers and hotelkeepers readily bought at .\u00a3232 an acre. There, in December 1852, was held the first of the goldfield Assizes. Mr. Justice Barry took his seat on the Bench and proceeded to the trial of forty prisoners, the diggers servino with great satisfaction on the jury, an unusually intelligent and patient set of jurymen, as the judge described them to be. They were delighted with the prospect of being rid of those worthless characters that brought discredit on their community, for a dozen scoundrels unchecked could disturb the peace of ten thousand orderly folks. Twenty-five of them were now removed for various periods of seclusion ; sixteen of the least desirable being withdrawn for periods of from three to twelve years. The diggers felt the era of civilisation approaching, and on others of the goldfields the same system of conducting trials on the spot, where witnesses were at hand and jurymen present who knew the places and the circumstances, did much to remove the lawless and disorderly element. But in spite of this fair commencement, Castlemaine was sadly deserted in the beginning of 1854. The diggers had moved away \u2014 out into the gullies all round, or out into flats beyond these again, ten, fifteen, twenty miles away \u2014 and though Castlemaine was surrounded by acre after acre of upturned earth, yet its army of diggers was gone. Only a kw, here and there, and these mostly Chinese, were occupied in again washing out the soil that had been left in loose heaps. But there was the Government camp consisting of large solid houses of stone ; there were shops, hotels, offices, two or three banks, a brewery, all of good stone; and excellent houses for * M'Combie's \"Australian Sketches.\" \"Correspondent of Argus, I*'eb. 1S52."], [367, "THE ERA OF GOLD.\u2014 1832 TO 1855. 345 'LD STURT-STREET, BALLARAT (1859). doctors and other professional men. It was, therefore, certain that Castlemaine would remain and prove the centre of the district, and while the miners left it, there came the merchant and the mechanic, and all that crowd of people required in the county town of a populous district.\" Bendigo, also, was a scene of varying fortunes. In September 1852 it was by far the most populous field in the colony. Over 55,000 persons were congregated there, as a rule an orderly crowd, women and children forming about a quarter of the whole. The people seemed mostly determined to make themselves comfortable in a permanent way. Many made log-huts after American fashion ; others made slab huts ; even the tents generally had a chimney of timber attached, and these, with small bottomless barrels on top for chimney-pots, looked picturesque after a manner. The women of the settlement, five thousand in number, mostly young wives, recently married, and content to share the fortunes of their husbands, cooked and washed, split wood, swept out their tents, and made all things tidy against the return of their clay-stained husbands for meals. In the afternoon, smartened up, often with the innate tastefulness of ladies, they went down to the main road, where for four or five miles a long range of weatherboard shops had arisen, or warehouses held in large marquees, in front of which great canvas signboards told in glaring letters the marvels of the display within ; there almost every shop floated its two, three, or four flags, a gay effect upon the long but muddy avenue.'0 Early comers had all been successful at Bendigo. Those who secured their claims in Eaglehawk Gully, or Pegleg Gully, or Golden Gully, or Adelaide Gully, became rich without trouble ; and for months the road through Five Mile Creek, as Woodend then was called, was one mighty \u25a0' Houiti's \"Two Years in Australia,\" p. 267.

The visitor who came to the \" Porcupine Hotel,\" the nearest inn, found it a little township wherein the landlord made his forty-thousand a year; and when he emerged upon the edge of the valley, and looked out on the winding course of the Bendigo Creek, he saw the most spacious goldfield which has ever been concentrated on one spot of the earth's surface. A vast multitude toiled in their deep pits of white clay, or were busy at the windlasses, most of them clad in blue serge shirts, with Jim Crow hats. Eaglehawk Gully was an absolute mass of people, dense as they could be crowded, with scarce room to walk between one claim and another. There fortunes were made every day, and for a long time the total yield of the Bendigo diggings was of the value of over half-a-million pounds a week. The average return for each man was about twelve pounds a week, and that for a whole year together; but unluckily, it was very unevenly distributed, one man got fifty, six got fifty among them, a dozen had two pounds a week, and another dozen had to be content with a pound or less \u2014 perhaps nothing at all. Alas ! how many there were whose golden dreams dwindled down to the mere hope of finding enough to keep the spark of life within their enfeebled bodies ! Many a poor fellow, watchful for a chance, a dozen times, and yet a dozen more, shouldered his slender effects and joined the hurrying crowd ; now to this rush and now to that. The stronger, the rougher, the more selfish pushed past him and elbowed him out of the way. Often he started with trembling eagerness in hopes to be among the first ; as often he came in when the lucky spots were already all appropriated. How sick the heart grows that is fed with hopes whose fruition is for ever coming but never comes ! The early digging years are full of tales of the silent, solitary stranger who made no friends ; who toiled from sunrise to sunset ; who trembled and shook with excite ment when some promising spot was reached among the wash-dirt ; \u2014 a man with some far-off purpose ; a toiler with some talisman, ever seen by him, never known by those that dwelt closest around him. The end of these poor fellows was too often a grave in alien soil. When men rushed to places wherein was no convenience for living ; where drinking-water was scanty or bad, where the cold earth was their couch through winter rains, where ten thousand people crowded with no proper drainage, there was always an excessive amount of sickness. Deaths from dysentery, and that fever called \" colonial,\" now very generally regarded as identical with typhoid, were distressingly frequent ; and rheumatic fever carried off its hundreds and its thousands. These eager, restless spirits, whom ill-luck constantly pursued, were the men most certain to be affected by the prevalent diseases, and on all the goldfields the cemetery was an early institu tion, and the rough carpenter who could knock together a few boards to make a rude coffin was as thriving a man as the diggings contained. But hundreds of men left their bodies in silent places, the scenes of temporary rushes. Down by some creek in the forest, signs had been discovered of gold. Thither had gone a score or two of men ; among them some of those who were perseveringly waiting for fortune to turn. They dig up the bed of the creek ; they pile its banks with mounds of clay and sand : one by one they drop away, all but that little band destined never to leave the scene. It very rarely happened but that a few sickened and died. Some morning when the stranger failed to leave his tent or his tarpaulin shelter, rough mates would look in to see how he fared ; rough hands would make him a bit of a pillow, or bring an extra coat to keep him warm ; well-meaning neighbours would bring him something to eat, and tell him that if he could only take his victuals he would soon be right as the bank. But after a few days the word would be passed that the sick man was dead, and work would be suspended by men who came to view with mournful eyes the silent figure that had once"], [369, "347 THE ERA OF GOLD.\u2014 1852 TO t8s5. toiled by their sides. In the evening his neighbours all lend a hand ; his grave is dug, while some one gathers his papers and, if aught can be discovered about him, volunteers to send the sad news to his native town. The body is laid in the forest, a rudely-lettered board, or an inscription cut on the overhanging tree, marks the chilly receptacle of extinguished hopes. Often in the present day the traveller may come upon one of those scenes of far-off illusions There are the claims, all is still, and silent, now ponds that sleep and cold, and there all cold and clear be neath the moonlight. There are the mounds, overgrown with grass Yonder are still the marks where the dig gers made their fires.

A DESERTED CLAIM. But in every sort of life there are these dark undercurrents. On the diggings they were more noticeable and more remarked only by reason of the open-air life and the absence of domestic privacy. Yet the new-comers on a large gold-field found the general appearance thriving and cheerful. The evening hours, when the steaming pannikins of tea had been disposed of, were generally rich with music. A few cornets at different corners of the valley blended their varied tunes, and their discordant keys. A few fiddles and a legion of concertinas kept the digger happy in his leisure hours. Bendigo was a favourite field for Germans, and when their work was done, if they got together, they would often roll out upon the dewy air of twilight the people's songs of the never-forgotten Fatherland, or perhaps a few sailors in good spirits would join in a \" Haul on the Bowline \" chorus. But one could not be long upon any of the goldfields without discovering how deeply rooted was the antipathy to the authorities. Here in Bendigo good order was preserved Quarter Sessions had been established only a month or two later than those of Castlemaine, but only seven persons were brought up for trial ; a township had been surveyed, and called Sand hurst ; a police magistrate ; an efficient post-office, and many other blessings of settled government were there. Still in a quiet way the diggers had a grudge, and one by no means unreasonable, against the manner in which they were ruled. If we loiter about among the diggings for an afternoon we shall soon perceive the reason. Yonder from the Government camp comes an assistant commissioner. He is ablaze with a gold-braided habit and gilt epaulettes. Behind him comes an orderly, and then there are half a dozen policemen; as they turn their steps hither subdued cries of \"Joe\" are passed among the crowd. It is a nick-name for Latrobe. Charles Joseph Latrobe appeared at the foot of so man)- proclamations that the diggers had at firsl derisively called all Government interference by the name of Charlie Joe, and latterly by the single word Foe. It is universally understood as a warning that the police are out upon what was"], [370, "348 VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. called a \"digger hunt.\" Those who have no licenses with them, or perhaps have no licenses at all, are thereby cautioned to disappear. The commissioner then dashes up : \" You fellow, show your license.\" \" That will do.\" He looks down a claim fifty feet deep, \" You fellow, come up and show your license.\" In vain the occupant below pleads that he has been up three times already to-day for the same purpose \u2014 to show his license to one or other of the officials or the police always prowling about. Up he comes, perhaps a gentleman, with too much spirit to take insolence calmly. He has to stand by with a menial air whilst the official duly scans the paper, and hands it back with never a word of apology for the trouble caused. Here is another man who has no license. He showed it twice, he says, this morning already, but left it in his other jumper when he went home at mid-day. The official sarcastically informs him, that of course it is in his other jumper, but that it is his business to have it at all times in his possession. So the police take him in custody. Here is another man in hiding. He is seen, and brought out. He has no license; he was \"cleaned out,\" he says, and had no money to pay for one. He must come along also ; and so the police gather a procession of defaulters, with whom they start for the camp, followed by the hooting of the crowd. That the diggers were not unreasonable is shown by the fact that commissioners like Mr. Gilbert, who displayed tact, and insisted that civility should be shown to the men, became popular, and had no trouble. But unluckily, Latrobe appointed a great number of quite another character. When people of good position in the old country wanted to get rid of their extravagant sons, or nephews of fast tendencies, they sent them off to Victoria with an introduction to Latrobe, who, zealous to oblige his influential friends at home, could always give these young fellows a commissionership at one or other of the diggings. In fact he appointed a great deal too many ; forty-one made a long list ; and those he selected were too often pert and forward youngsters, who had never learnt to do anything in the world for their living, and came out with an inclination to look on diggerhunting as a kind of sport, and to show the choiceness of their breeding by a haughty and contemptuous air to all who wore the plain clothes of a miner. The Jackanapes manners of these idle young scapegraces caused a deep-rooted resentment to gather on the goldfields, and the diggers, who would otherwise have sided with the authorities in their efforts to carry out the law, were inclined to sympathise with the law-breakers. It was clearly the interest of the diggers to sec that if some paid the license fee, all should pay it. Their natural position would have been that if thirty thousand paid the fee, then the other ten thousand should also pay the fee if they could, or if not, they should go away and leave the field to those who had paid for the right to extract its gold. But the folly of Latrobe's junior appointments drove the current of sentiment in the opposite way. The gentleman who was six times in one day rudely ordered up to show his ticket never forgot it; nor did the honest fellow ever forgive the commissioner who marched him to the police tent, chained him there to a tree all night, and next morning fined him \u00a32 for having lost his license ticket, even though the books of the commissioners would have shown, if they had been consulted, that the fee had been duly paid. It was his business to have his paper about him, said these smart officials. It was no part of their duty to hunt up the books and see if he had paid. Hence the deep dislike to commissioners and police. The diggers threw every obstacle in their way. The cry of \" Joe \" set them all on the alert to mislead their persecutors and screen the paperless. Amusing tales are told of diggers, breaking suddenly away when the police succeeded in surprising a corner of the goldfield ; of an exciting chase for a couple of miles, the miner dodging in and out among the claims till he got a start out into"], [371, "THE ERA OF GOLD.\u2014 1832 TO 1833. 349 the scrub, where he let himself be caught quietly, and then produced his license to the baffled police, who, on returning, found all who were left on the spot duly provided with tickets, the others having taken a holiday on some other part of the field. Others tell of men who kept a woman's apparel in their tents, ready at a moment's notice to play the part of some busy housewife, a trick not so difficult in those days when faces were shaven clean. If the junior officials were foolish, petulant, and rude, even the elder ones, who had less ostentation, were rarely pleasant in their manner. Not that they were consciously offensive, but they had a mistaken notion of the circumstances. They regarded the diggers as a common set of fellows with whom they, the officials, were bound to take a high hand if discipline was to be maintained. Their proper attitude, in their opinion, was that of the officers of a ship towards the men in the forecastle \u2014 any politeness would only serve to make the dogs mutinous. That was a position the diggers resented. A good half of them were decidedly above the rank of common seamen. Large numbers had been trained mechanics, with a fair amount of self-respect, and expecting to be treated with proper courtesy. A certain percentage were gentlemen, whose blood boiled too hotly at these indignities to permit them to take the side of the authorities, as they would otherwise have done. But in truth, it was difficult to see how some such feeling in a mild form could have been avoided. The great bulk of these people had been accustomed in the old country to enjoy the order and peace which the police provided without ever coming in contact with them, and if they did find occasion to meet a policeman, that officer was probably their inferior ; certainly not their superior. When they reached the diggings they were for ever in contact with the police, who assumed all the airs of superiors, and dealt with regard to licenses and claims and other matters with the most autocratic of airs. Secondly, there is no more unpopular visitor than the tax-collector. We all dislike him, even when he appears but once a year. But if he came once a month for our money, and then made a practice of calling twice a week to see if we had actually paid, and each time demanded to look at our receipt, the mildest tempered of men would sometimes be tempted to remember there was a poker in the house. And when police and tax gatherers were identical, the odium of the position was so much the more intense. And then there was that camp of soldiers \u2014 twenty, fist)-, or a hundred \u2014 up upon the hill, not intended to protect the miners, but ostentatiously placed there to threaten them if they should dream of resisting the payment of the fee. The fact was, that the rule of the goldfield was too much that of autocratic officialism, backed by a menacing force of military. It could not be at all palatable to a high-spirited community. Hence a restless feeling on all the goldfields ; the diggers were as a body desirous of law and order, and willing to comply with regulations, but they freely expressed their discontent. Latrobe had occasionally obtained a hint of the ill-judged conduct of the officials on the diggings, and he was annoyed at their foil)', but he did not resolutely attack the evil ; he expressed his vexation in his despatches, but he did not dismiss the offenders, and the commissioners too often took pains to stifle the complaints of individual miners. In February 1853 the first collision took place at the Ovens diggings. A constable, while dislodging a party who had no license from out the claims they were working in, by accident shot one of them dead. Great excitement ensued ; an assistant commissioner, whose manners had been offensive, was roughly handled, and the riot seemed likely to take a serious turn. Latrobe reports that \"the first excitement over, there did not appear to be any real disposition to resist the law; but a general feeling prevailed that the authorities had not conducted them-"], [372, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 350 selves properly.\" With that opinion Latrobe coincided, speaking of the \" ill-judged if not improper conduct of the authorities.\" But, unluckily, he was not a man of sufficient firmness to see that snch conduct did not occur again. Naturally, the whole odium of the situation gathered upon the head of the inoffensive Latrobe. Four months later the tone of his despatches shows that he is cruelly wounded by the criticisms of the press. The Argus took the lead in a general crusade against him. It used the most unsparing language, and the proprietor inserted this notice for some time daily, as an advertisement: \u2014 \" Wanted a Governor. Apply to the people of Victoria.\" In July came a second disturbance. A storekeeper at Castlemaine, named M'Mahon, had been accused by an informer of \"sly grog\" selling. . In spite of his protestations that he had no liquor in his house, his store was burnt down by the arbitrary sub-inspector Christian \u2014 a summary way of dealing in these cases, which the police had acquired on the diggings. But with it he had burnt down a boarding-house belonging to M'Mahon, and also the stores of two other people, supposed to be implicated. An angry scene occurred ; a Baptist minister, named Jackson, spoke up for the rights of the people, on which Christian threatened to arrest him. Three hundred diggers gathered as if to protect their champion. They agreed to see that the matter should be set right, but that their agitation should be peaceful. During the night, however, some inflammatory placards appeared, calling for the death of trooper Christian and of the perjured informer Mangan; and violence would have been done had not the magistrate next day decided that the accused had been innocent, that the informer had committed perjury, and that the Government ought to compensate the sufferers. In the end there was awarded \u00a3350 as compensation. The perjurer was sentenced to five years' imprisonment, and the storm blew over ; but it left a very bad impression as to the power and temper of the police. Through out the remainder of 1853 a very strong feeling gathered against Latrobe, and what had been a vague discontent began to exhibit the more tangible form of an antagonism to the license fee. On the first of August 5000 of the diggers of Bendigo and Castlemaine presented a petition praying that the tax should be reduced to ten shillings a month ; that quarterly licenses should be issued if the miner so desired ; that new arrivals and invalids should be allowed fifteen days' grace before the levy of the fee ; and that the practice should be discontinued of sending an armed force to exact it. A deputation took this petition to Latrobe, who received them pleasantly. He said that the license fees, though amounting to \u00a3474,000 per annum, did not cover the expenses of the goldfields. To this the general reply of the country was that the management of affairs was absurdly costly, and that there was little supervision of ridiculous charges. There could be no doubt that among some of the officials the most impudent laziness was combined with a rapacity that evidently relied with bold confidence on the feebleness of the administration. He promised to refer the matter to the Legislative Council. He could not promise to reduce the fee, but the other requests he was inclined to grant. In reply to a general charge against the manner in which the officials on the goldfields discharged their duty, he stated, as the result of his inquiries, that no misconduct on the part of his subordinates had passed without punishment, and that he \"believed it was the general wish of the officers entrusted with the government of the goldfields to act rightly.\" Three days later a meeting of diggers was held at the Protestant Hall, in Melbourne, when a motion, proposed by Dr. Owen, was carried that the meeting \"viewed with regret the fast-spreading disaffection against the Government, and considered that this was caused by the residents of the goldfields being denied their political and social rights.\" A second resolution pledged those present to secure a reduction of the license fee and the enfranchisement of the"], [373, "THE ERA OP GOLD.- ,852 TO 1S33. 351 miners. On the 20th August the miners of Sandhurst met and passed a resolution that none should pay more than ten shillings as a license fee. If the authorities refused that sum, all the diggers should offer themselves for arrest, when their overwhelming numbers would paralyse all action against them; and such as the police failed to arrest should place a placard on their tents \"No license taken here.\" Seven days later they held a second meeting at Sandhurst, and agreed that every one who wished to abide by their previous decision should wear a piece of red ribbon in his hat. From the Goulburn diggings, called Waranga, there came resolutions of the same character; and Latrobe saw those visions vanish of that perfect order and ARRIVAL OK GOLD ESCORT AT THE OLD TREASURY, QUEEN MELBOURNE contentment which he stated to the Secretary for the Colonies to have been, through God's providence, the results of his administration of the goldfields. He then adopted a feeble measure. A vacancy had occurred in the Legislative Council. Now, it was one of the grievances of the diggers that they had no votes and no one to represent them in the Legislature. The vacancy was that of a nominee member. Latrobe informed the diggers that he would appoint a gentleman to represent them. It was a fatuous idea; the diggers informed the gentleman nominated that he must not regard himself as being in any way a representative of theirs. Latrobe thereupon thought that as his kindly offer had been dismissed with disdain, the diggers must of necessity mean mischief; they were disloyal; they meant revolution, anarch)', and heaven knew what. There were a great number of foreigners amongst Vol. I. z T"], [374, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 352 them. That was a bad sign. He ordered eighty more soldiers to march upon Sandhurst, so as to concentrate there a total force of 154 military and 171 police. At Waranga a collision took place. The police arrested a number of miners for having no licenses ; an attempt at rescue was made ; a rough fight ensued, though no one was seriously wounded ; the unlicensed diggers were released. Next day a great demonstration was made at Sandhurst. Four thousand men gathered ; after harangues and resolutions two thousand of them formed a procession to march to the Chief Commissioner's tent. A few somewhat feeble instru ments led the way ; then came an immense banner, the green harp of Erin ; a Union Jack, the French tricolor, the German revolutionary flag, black, red and gold ; the stars and stripes of America, and so forth. They formed a meeting close to the commissioners' camp, round a platform from which floated the \" diggers' flag\" \u2014 blue, with a southern cross in white. Some speeches were made ; some cheering and shouting took place ; about forty or fifty pistols were discharged into the air ; and then the formal proceedings began. A deputation of thirty went forward to the commissioners' tent and offered ten shillings each for a license, while the main body of the meeting remained in orderly fashion outside the fence. Commissioner Wright answered that he had not made the law, nor could he unmake it. He could not receive less than the legal sum. The deputation politely withdrew. But that evening Commissioner Wright forwarded to Latrobe a report, in which he stated that it was useless to hope that the full fee could ever again be exacted on the goldfields. The diggers were organising a passive resistance, and when twenty thousand men were prepared to surrender and be taken into custody rather than pay, it was clear that the authorities were checkmated. Mr. Wright anxiously requested instructions. The next month's fee would be due in four days; was he to attempt a compulsory levy? An orderly galloped into town with a letter containing this enquiry, and next night Latrobe replied that the license fee would be abandoned, and an export duty on gold established in its place ; that a bill to that effect would be laid before the Legislative Council ; that in the meantime the commissioners were to take no measures to compel the payment of the fee for September. However, the miners were to be informed that it was out of the Governor's power to alter the law ; and that until the Council should meet the miners would still be under the obligation of paying the fee prescribed. Latrobe handed this memorandum to be transcribed by a clerk, so that a copy might be sent to each of the goldfields. The lazy fellow, in transcribing, seems to have omitted all this latter portion in the copy that went to Bendigo, the most important goldfield of all. There the commissioner posted a notice that the license fee was to be abolished, and (a matter that was intended only for his private instruction) intimated that no effort would be made to compel payment for September. The diggers hailed this as a complete triumph ; the obnoxious fee was abolished. For two days mutual congratulations passed, and the cheering cup circulated. But then it became known to the authorities that a mistake had occurred. The Chief Commissioner of Police galloped down to town and received a supplementary proclamation to be posted on the goldfields. This was forwarded, and duly posted. It informed the diggers that whatever might be the ultimate decision of the Legislative Council, all miners must in the meantime pay their license fees as usual. 'The Governor intimated that he relied on the good sense and loyalty of the community. This notification was received at Bendigo with anything but satisfaction. Commissioner Wright informed Latrobe that he could not now attempt to compel the payment of the license without breaking the implied promise contained in his previous announcement to the diggers. However, Latrobe was injudicious enough in his"], [375, "THE ERA OF GOLD.\u2014 1852 TO 1853. 353 alarm to send to Bendigo all the military then in Melbourne, 145 in number, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Valiant, while he obtained the loan of a body of marines from Her Majesty's ship Electra, which was then in the Bay. These were employed to mount guard over the Melbourne Gaol. This movement did not tend to conciliate the diggers, of whom the vast majority desired to agitate for what they conceived their rights in a strictly constitutional way. The fact that a few were anxious to play at revolutions, that a number of melodramatic spirits chose to float banners and march with a cracked fife ahead of them, did not convert the great body of diggers into contumacious rebels. On the contrary, at all their meetings the miners concluded their proceedings with three cheers for the Queen, and on goldfields where any of the commissioners had been considerate in their manner, they also received a hearty cheer, which showed the general good feeling that prevailed. But Latrobe was deeply offended at the turn which affairs had taken. He was fully aware that he was surrounded by a vast mass of unpopularity. He was fully conscious that he had honestly and uprightly striven to do. his duty. But he was half conscious that he was not robust enough in character for the position he held at that juncture. Ten years sooner he had suited very well. Ten years later he would again have been successful. But at this transition period, when he had to take the management and responsibilities of all departments on himself, he was incapable of meeting the needs of the sudden expansion that had occurred. He appointed forty-one commissioners, assistant commissioners, and junior commissioners, each with four or five hundred a-year. To these was entrusted unlimited authority on the goldfields. Many of them would have required a decidedly sharp rein ; some of them spent the public money as freely as they had used to do their own in London ; and Latrobe, bewildered by the sudden growth of a goldfields department that numbered a thousand individuals, a public works department of about 1500, a body of militia of about 613, with greatly swollen departments for police, and customs, and law, and lands, and so forth, had allowed all things to adjust themselves to a great extent. The management was haphazard, and while he thought that by the multiplicity of the reports he was receiving monthly he was kept fully alive to all that was passing, he was obliged afterwards to confess that he had known but little of what was going on in some parts of his public departments. He now was terribly anxious; he thought that at any moment he might have a force of twenty thousand armed diggers marching on Melbourne, so little did he really understand the temper on the goldfields. In his haste he sent off Lieutenant Andrew Clarke, of the Royal Engineers, with a steamer, to proceed straight to Hobart, and bring away as many troops as Governor Denison could spare. He brought back with him 200 men from Hobart and forty-five from Launceston, and these made a total of 858 soldiers in the colony. But that did not satisfy Latrobe. He wrote to Sydney asking that Melbourne should be made the headquarters of the 40th Regiment ; that Sir Robert Nickle, the Commander-in-Chief for the colonies, should come to Melbourne with the remaining 200 men of that regiment. They came, and raised the total to more than a thousand regular troops in the colony, with cannon and all requirements, and under the command of an officer, old indeed, and slowly dying of incurable disease, but full of experience, and with no little vigour. All this made Latrobe feel safe, but he was mortally wounded by the attitude of the colonists. Immediately he called a meeting of his Legislative Council. In his opening address, after referring to other matters, he pointed out the necessity of reviewing the legislation in regard to the license fees, and concluded by intimating that he had sent home his resignation of"], [376, "VICTORIA AND ITS METRO POLLS: PAST AND PRESENT. 354 his position. He expressed the satisfaction he felt in having seen that slender settlement of Port Phillip, which he had come to rule only fifteen years before, converted into the great colony of Victoria, but he must now surrender his charge into other hands. The Legislative Council appointed a committee to inquire into the question of the license fee. It took some evidence ; discussed the matter : resolved that an export duty on gold was inexpedient ; but that the license fee should be reduced to twenty shillings a month, and that if the miner was willing to take out a license for a longer period, the fee should be only two pounds for three months, three pounds for six. months, or five pounds for a year. Holders of annual licenses should have the right to vote in political elections. In the meantime, on the 14th September, Latrobe had obtained from the Legislative Council a temporary act, allowing him to issue a license for the three months beginning 1st September at the reduced rate of two pounds for the three months. This measure of relief, for the time being, satisfied the diggers, who freely paid their forty shillings each, and waited for the report of the committee for such further relief as might be granted them. In all there were 47,380 icenses taken out for the three months, and on 7th October, Chief Commissioner Wright reports that \"a more than ordinary degree of tranquillity prevails\" over all the goldfields. But Latrobe's resignation had gone. He was only waiting for permission to vacate his post. He had sent his wife and family to England, and was now anxious to be away from the scene of his annoyances. He did not, however, neglect his duty meantime. He brought up a bill before the Legislative Council based on the report of the committee, but with many changes. The fee for six months was to be four pounds instead of three ; for a year it was to be eight pounds instead of five. And all storekeepers and others who carried on any trade were also to take out licenses at fifty pounds a year ; while leases were to be given of land for mining purposes. At the beginning of the year the great mass of the diggers took out the three months' license at two pounds. There was no inducement to take that for six months at four pounds, or that for a year at eight ; for Latrobe was too conservative to think of extending the suffrage, as had been recommended by the committee, to diggers who had merely paid a year's license fee. But 258 persons signed a petition against the very heavy fee of fifty pounds to be exacted from any one who wished to set up a business on the goldfields. In reply, His Excellency regretted that he was quite unable to comply with the prayer of the memorialists. There was, therefore, a new agitation to keep the body-politic warm till Latrobe should depart. But shortly afterwards he received the permission he had been waiting for, and on 1st May he penned the last of his despatches as Lieutenant-Governor of Victoria. Four days later he embarked on board the Golden Age.\" The news had just reached him of the death of Mrs. Latrobe, three months before, in England. He was departing in grief and disappointment. A kindlier feeling of the colonists welled out to him, and they did not allow him to leave without many testimonials of regard. Addresses from public bodies were numerous, and when the barge of the Electra took him on board to row him down the river, he was heartily cheered by crowds of people who knew him to be amiable, upright, hard-working, and well-meaning ; who liked the man, and thought highly of him, though they had criticised with free tongue the administration of the Governor. On reaching London he had the mortification to find that the Colonial Office took the same view of his manner of governing. They thought it feeble. Although only fifty three years of age he was never again employed in any public capacity. Very probably he \" M'Combie's \"History of Victoria,\" p. 255."], [377, "THE ERA OF GOLD.\u2014 1832 TO 1835. 355 never sought to be. He had somewhat lost heart. His property at Jolimont had risen in value from the few hundreds he had paid for it, to be worth some forty thousand pounds. He was possessed of other property, and probably preferred to spend the calm evening of his days in literary pleasures. The loss of his eyesight must have been a severe deprivation in his later years. He died at the age of seventy-four, on 4th December 1875, a man of singularly upright and amiable character, whose name is indelibly associated with the history of Victoria, a Governor whose pure morals and whose devotion to intellectual pursuits formed a beneficial example in the early days of the community while it proudly floated onward upon the waves of a material prosperity. He was a staunch advocate of the rights and of the dignity of the colony with whose growth he had been identified. Two of his last public efforts before leaving the colony had been to secure the recognition of her pre-eminent position in Australasia. In the Act passed by the British Parliament in 1850 for the better Government of the Australasian Colonies, it was provided that one city should be chosen as the supreme seat of government, and that the Governor there resident should be proclaimed the Governor-General. At the time it had been fully understood that Sydney should be that seat of supreme government, and, by courtesy, though not by any express instructions, Sir Charles Fitzroy had been generally entitled the Governor-General. But the discovery of the goldfields, following so soon after, with its immense influence in altering the distribution of the population, had caused the Home authorities to delay the choice of a supreme seat of government. On the 17th of September, 1852, the Legislative Council at Melbourne petitioned the Queen to assign to their city that honour. Latrobe threw himself heartily into the project, and showed that Melbourne was, even then, half as large again as Sydney, and theiefore the largest city of Australia. But the Duke of Newcastle, who, in 1853, was Secretary for the Colonies, was a mild man, and inclined to shirk all squabbles and contentions. He advised the Queen to appoint no seat of supreme government, and communicated to Latrobe that decision. But one little change resulted from the effort. Latrobe was only Lieutenant- Governor. When his successor was appointed, the word Lieutenant was omitted, and he ranked as equal with the Governor at Sydney. The second agitation was connected with the establishment of a branch of the Royal Mint. Sydney had been permitted in 1852 to erect an establishment of that sort. Buildings had been constructed, machinery and officials were on their way from London. Was it to be tolerated that Melbourne, the larger city, and the city of gold, should be without its mint if Sydney had one? Latrobe, in 1852, sent a request for permission to erect a Royal mint. The Legislative Council joined in the application, and forwarded a petition to the Queen. The Mayor, Aldermen, and Citizens of Melbourne also sent home their petition to the same effect. No direct answer was ever returned. In England, the petition was referred to the authorities of the Mint, who were adverse to it. Though they had exacted from Sydney the most ample guarantees that the coins there struck off should be of the same weight and same degree of purity as the Imperial sovereign, yet they looked with suspicion on the possible results. The Duke of Newcastle, a well-meaning man, who complained that he very often lay awake all night thinking what he ought to do, but who often feared to do it after all, seems to have avoided all responsibility in the matter, and to have made up his mind not to interfere unless there came a second application. But the people of Melbourne were not now quite so anxious. It was possible to pay too dearly for a shadowy honour. The Sydney folks had spent fifty thousand pounds on"], [378, "356 VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. their mint; the annual receipts were twelve thousand; the working expenses fifteen thousand. It was therefore a costly dignity. But what was the value of it? The British authorities refused to recognise the Sydney sovereign as legal tender anywhere in the empire save in New South Wales. If one of these coins went home to London it was weighed as merely so much gold, melted up, and recoined in the Imperial mint. Under these circumstances none of the other colonies showed any disposition to accept the Sydney coin, and unless the gold colonies could coin for the empire, their mints were likely to prove small and costly institutions. In Melbourne, therefore, the agitation died out. Latrobe, its originator, was gone. Nobody was enthusiastic, and there was no further talk about it till, in 1859, the Imperial authorities conceded to the Sydney sovereign the right to pass current all over the British dominions. If these had been abortive efforts, there was another in which Latrobe had been most successful. Governor Bourke, in laying out the city of Melbourne in 1837, had made no provision for parks. What did a little country town, cut out of the all-surrounding forest, want with parks? But the unprecedented growth of the city had made the omission a matter that in the end would have had serious consequences; and, in 1852, when it began to exceed all bounds, Latrobe reserved from sale an almost complete belt of land round the original city. Suburbs were laid out beyond these lands, but ample room was left for recreation grounds. Great pressure, was brought to bear by land speculators and others to secure the sale of these valuable sites, but Latrobe remained firm, and the existence of the Flagstaff Gardens, Royal Park, Prince's Park, Carlton Gardens, Fitzroy Gardens, Yarra Park, Fawkner Park, and the Botanic Gardens Reserve, is due to the wise foresight of Latrobe. To him also must be ascribed in part the credit of institutions for mental and moral progress which have yet to be recorded in later pages, and we have in our midst a thousand things to remind us of his long connection with the colony. He was not a great man, nor a man of heroic cast. It was rather his opportunities for good than his own commanding merits that have secured for him our grateful remembrance. But in proportion as these early times grow distant; in proportion as Victoria becomes more populous and gathers round her more and more of a national feeling ; in proportion as the value is recognised of institutions once humble but now growing large, which were laid on wise foundations in these early days ; so there will appear in our annals in ever bolder relief the simple, unostentatious, genial and gentlemanly figure of Charles Joseph Latrobe. GOVERNOR LATROBE IN LATER LIFE."], [379, "DVERNMENT H USE, TOORA CHAPTER XIX Zbe Era of H)emocrac\\\\\u2014 1854 to l86o Ps@ N 1853 the constitution of Victoria was far from being democratic, though the \"\u00a7\u00bb< Ol general temper of the great majority of its people was decidedly so. During the LsSLJjLkJ three or four years that followed, there occurred agitations, on one occasion of lamentable violence, in order to adjust the machinery of government to the wishes of the community, and in the end Victoria was converted from an approximate oligarchy into a State which ma)*, without exaggeration, be called the most democratic the world has yet seen. For though, in form, its government is less apparently built upon the power of the people, than that of the United States, yet, as a matter of fact, there is no community in existence, where legislation and State administration answer so fully and so easily to every wish of the masses. Fortunately checks are not wholly wanting ; but these are light \u2014 so very light that in a community less generally prosperous, disaster might occasionally be expected from popular caprice ; but where property is so widely distributed, in a community whose working classes possess a very large proportion of the real estate, the results of a perfectly unhampered rule of the people have been by no means unfortunate. Many of those who landed on these shores from 1852 to 1856 had visionary hopes that could not find their realisation on any spot of mortal soil. These ardent souls were longing for a light that never was on sea or land, for an ideal happiness which was to be attained through constitutional reforms, though unattainable unless man should be of a sudden renovated, his animal nature transformed, his weaknesses and his passions, his meannesses and his follies all deleted from his character. The)- found no Utopia, such as they had dreamed of, but the)- saw in a few short years a very great movement in the direction of their fervent hopes."], [380, "358 VICTORIA AND DPS METROPOLIS PAST AND PRESENT. In 1854 the men who actually had a vote were not a tenth part of those in the community. Those who possessed freehold property to the value of one hundred pounds were not numerous, and it was a constant complaint that the successful diggers who would have wished to invest their earnings in land, and so might have entered the circle of the franchised few, could obtain no land on account of those regulations which left the squatter an inviolable lease extending to fourteen years. A remarkable result of this state of affairs was that the pastoral tenants were converted into the aristocracy of the land ; and those who but five years ago had been living in bark huts, cutting their tough mutton with jack-knives, and baking their own dampers at an open fireplace under a mud-daubed chimney, were now the representatives of those lords of the manor whose hereditary rights and privileges in other lands had stirred to anger these patriotic visitors to our shores. The Government strictly adhered to its bargain, though bad as it could be, in reference to the lands, and cases are related such as that of a squatter who paid but twenty pounds a year as the rent of a great run, and yet when hay was wanted from it for the Government camp at a neighbouring goldfield demanded and received five hundred pounds a year for the right to cut hay from a single paddock of that run. One man paid ten pounds a year, yet received at the rate of two thousand for the vegetables he raised on a few acres ; another, who paid twenty pounds a year, allowed the use of his run to the State for five thousand ; another, who paid ten pounds, secured four thousand a year from the diggers and carriers who turned their horses out into his paddocks at ten shillings a week each. Again, there was a regulation which stated that on any run the land should be saleable only to the occupant during the continuance of his lease, the sole stipulation being that the minimum price should be one pound per acre. The squatters had not at first freely availed themselves of this provision, but when the gold discoveries put a different aspect upon affairs, they bought up the land in large quantities, well knowing that in the districts where they bought it the value would double and quadruple in a year or two. Hence the Orders-in-Council, though wisely conceived at the time, were, by the accident of the gold discovery, converted into a vast source of expense to the State, at the same time that they caused a very great loss of revenue. The squatters were not a numerous body; their total number was certainly under a thousand. Fawkner computed it at only 660. These were all converted into men of valuable properties, and now occupied the position of the capitalists of the community ; and also of the land monopolists. Against them was the fierceness of democratic ardour directed ; and the fight upon the land question grew more and more bitter as the years rolled on. But in regard to other matters of popular clamour, all were won before a very few years had passed away. Manhood suffrage, the ballot, abolition of property qualification for members of Parliament, the equality of electoral districts, short Parliaments, the eight hours' system of labour, and other ideals of the Chartist party at home, had been secured ; protection to native industry in the interests of the working classes, and legal enactments for the exclusion of cheap labour, these and other measures, which showed very clearly whither the preponderance of political power had gone, followed close upon the agitations that filled the years from 1854 to 1860. Latrobe had foreseen the troubles that were coming and had fled before the storm. He had been kept at his post many months after he had wished to leave, for the English Government was anxious to secure a peculiarly suitable Governor for this new colony that had risen into so sudden and so critical a degree of notice. It had itself offered a salary of fifteen thousand pounds per annum in order to secure the best that money could induce"], [381, "THE ERA OF DEMOCRACY.\u2014 1834 TO 1860. 359 to accept the office. Also, there was perhaps a hope in the colony that if a man of genuine ability should arrive, poor, weak, gentlemanly, used-up Sir Charles Fitzroy, at Sydney, would have to take second place, and the Governor-Generalship would in effect, if not in name, pass to the occupant of Government House at Melbourne. Victoria had taken care also to make that house consistent with the grandeur that was to be of their new Governor. A fine estate had been purchased at Toorak, or Tourac as it was then spelt, and a hundred thousand pounds set apart for erecting on it a handsome mansion. The gentleman whom the Colonial Office chose for the position was a captain in the Royal navy. For six-and-thirty years he had fought in many quarters of the globe, and carried the thunder of British guns over many seas. He had drawn to himself special attention, and had obtained the honour of knighthood for the skill with which he had conducted an expedition \u2014 the first warlike operations carried on in steam vessels \u2014 up the river La Plata, against the restless General Rosas, dictator of the Argentine Republic. In that he was completely successful, and on being despatched six years later as plenipotenti ary to the same portion of South America, he managed his diplomatic duties with so much care, and secured for the commerce of England advantages so material, in the way of opening up that continent to European traffic, that the Colonial Office, in recognition, bestowed upon him the lucrative position of Governor in Victoria. Though fifty years of age, he married just before sailing. He and Lady Hotham were to have been conveyed to Melbourne in a ship-of-war with all due celat ; but the date of his departure was almost ex actly that of the declaration of war against Russia, and all the navy was at that time wanted for the Black Sea, or for the Baltic. SIR CHARLES HOTHAM When the Queen of Ike South, bringing with her the long-looked-sor pair, was signalled on 2 ist June 1854, at the Flagstaff Hill, Melbourne was in excitement to give a worthy reception to him whom it regarded as, in a manner, the first of its Governors. He landed from a ship's boat at Sandridge, and a great crowd waited there to receive him. It fell in behind his carriage and formed a long procession that extended a couple of miles along the road.1 It crossed Prince's Bridge under a triumphal arch, whereon the letters were worked, in blue on a white ground, \" Victoria Welcomes Victoria's Choice.\" At the Government offices he was duly sworn in and installed. A smart trot back, through streets and roads lined with welcoming faces, carried him to the pleasant villa at Toorak overlooking the Yarra. He was very much interested in learning all he could about the colony he had come to govern, and in a hearty sailor-like fashion took the cause of the diggers under his care. They were certainly, he thought, more worried than benefited by the swarm of officials who took so much charge of them. He would be glad to sec the unpopular license fee abolished. But of course he did not publicly announce an)- of these views, it being his duty to administer the law as he found it until it should in due course be altered. Meantime he would go and sec for himself these goldfields and these diggers whose 1 M'Combie, \"History of Victoria,\" p. 256. Vol. I* 2 L"], [382, "360 VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. interests must form so large a part of his care. In the month following their arrival, Sir Charles and Lady Hotham were at Ballarat. They spent three days there, and were surprised at the remarkably good order prevailing among these dwellers in tents. They arrived very quietly, and for some time they walked unknown among the canvas streets, observant of the novel sights that surrounded them. They stopped to watch the operations in a deep claim, and then they were discovered. The word was passed from digger to digger, and in a few minutes a crowd of many thousands had gathered, cheering and showing an exuberant loyalty. The roads were muddy; the miners brought their slabs, intended for their claims, and laid them side by side on the watery patches. The process not keeping pace with the progress of the distinguished pair, they reached a crab-hole before the timbers were laid. Up 'stepped Big Larry, a well-known giant of a digger, and lifting her ladyship under the arms, deposited her safely on the other side. Three times three cheers greeted this popular episode, and for fully a mile and a-half the diggers who lined the muddy track cheered, and showed their goodwill to the new Governor. When they were safe in their quarters a great crowd gathered in respectful silence, save for an occasional cheer for the \"Digger's Charlie.\"2 Hotham did not take their clumsy demonstrations amiss. He was extremely impressed with what he saw, especially the quiet, orderly aspect of the Sunday, when all the diggers were at rest, and little evidence could be seen of the eager haste, the impatience to be rich, that had gathered all these crowds to live thus roughly on the goldfields. He visited all the nearest diggings, and reported to the Colonial Office3 that \"the mass of the diggers are true hearted and loyal men, who, if well treated, may be depended upon, and all are interested in upholding law and order.\" During the two days he stayed at Bendigo, a petition was presented against the license fee. He returned for answer that some sort of tax would be necessary, as they must pay for liberty and order. In response they loudly cheered, and he thought the license fee grievance was gone. But the trouble was not so much the fee itself as the mode of its collection, which was arbitrary and exasperating, and so costly that one-half of the total receipts were spent in the mere expenses of commissioners and police. Hotham himself reports that the goldfields are evidently the resort of young officers, who have no particular qualifications for a very delicate duty, and that they are too often imperious in manner and tone, so that they provoke the resentment of men particularly quick to vindicate their self-respect. Latrobe, out of the best of intentions, had forbidden the sale of liquor upon the goldfields. It was a sad mistake. Ten thousand schemes were afoot for smuggling it in at night. A hundred shanties, under many varied pretexts, sold the fiery draughts, free from supervision, but always with the danger imminent that the police would ride down and set fire to the premises and their contents. Hence, liquor was extremely dear. The digger who wished a glass of beer had to break the law or go without; and he often saw the tent of the man who gratified him in his desire ruthlessly and summarily destroyed by the police, who, being largely ex-convicts, performed their task with no excess of delicacy. But it was well known that the police, both officers and men, possessing this complete, this arbitrary, this autocratic power, were mostly for sale ; they had their figure ; and it suited well with the interests of the storekeepers on the diggings to pay a handsome sum to the inspector or sergeant, as well as bonuses to the men, to be allowed the monopoly of the sale of drink to so large and so thirsty a crowd ; and thus the diggers saw, with the utmost indignation, man)- acts of shameful favouritism.

'\u25a0' House of Commons Papers, 1853."], [383, "THE ERA OF DEMOCRACY.\u2014 1854 TO 1860. 361 cause of discontent was the presence of so many Chinese. The miners had no good ground of complaint, but they disliked these men as fellow- workers, and a few agitators endeavoured to foment a riotous feeling in regard to them. A demon stration was attempted on the 4th of July 1854, but it passed off as a mere fiasco. Hotham reported : \u2014 \" The good sense of the community suffocated the schemes of a few factious and discontented individuals, and the services of the police were in no way needed.\" Hotham himself disliked the Chinese, and desired to see them excluded, and he himself proposed a measure slygrog-selling on the diggincs. (From a sketch by S. T. Gill.) by which it should be imperative on the Chinese to bring with them their women on penalty of being fined ten pounds a head for every male in excess of the female Chinese immigrants; he reports, however, that the diggers were as willing as he was himself that all things should move forward in an orderly manner. But the manners of the officials on the goldfields, and a wide-spread though greats exaggerated belief in their corruption, caused an undercurrent of discontent which Hothan failed to see on his visit. It made itself painfully visible, however, in the month of October, and a small spark kindled a great flame. A Scottish miner of Ballarat, named Scobie, on the 9th of October, met with a brother Scot named Martin. Broad seas had rolled between them since last they had foregathered ; and though both were hardworking, respectable men, the festivity of that happy meeting was too much for them. They adjourned to the township, complied too earnestly with the injunctions of Burns's popular song, and took a \" walliewacht \" or two in excess. Towards midnight they sought the locality of Scobie's tent on the Eureka lead, but as they passed the Eureka Hotel they proposed a final cup. The hotel was closed, and all in darkness. In spite of a great commotion made by the two carousing friends, Bentley, the hotelkeeper, declined to open his door. They passed on ; but, looking round, Scobie saw a light in the hotel. He asked his friend to stay there while he went back to try again. He was never again seen alive. In the morning he was found dead, killed near the door of the hotel, and in all probability with a spade. At the inquest the evidence showed that a disturbance had taken place at the door of the hotel, and many things tended to prove that Bentley, his wife, and a lodger in the house had sallied forth, and that Scobie had been slain in the scuffle. The verdict at the inquest was that the \" deceased had died from injuries inflicted by persons unknown.\" But Bentley was a noted ruffian ; he had served his ten years in Norfolk Island, and had been concerned in many a doubtful transaction. His wife was, from a moral point of view, no beauty, and the hotel"], [384, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 362 had a low reputation. The miners were convinced that Bentley and his wife were the murderers. This feeling grew so strong, that in deference to it Bentley, his wife, and the lodger were apprehended and tried at the police court. There the presiding officer was a Mr. Dewes, the police magistrate. Along with him sat Commissioner Rede and Assistant Commissioner Johnstone. Dewes hurried over the proceedings ; gave ever)- advantage to the prisoners, and finally acquitted them. Now, it was known on the diggings that Dewes was pecuniarily indebted to Bentley for a large sum. Dewes did not deny it. Though he had ,\u00a3500 a year, and .\u00a3150 for allowances, he had not lived on that sum ; besides, he had entered into land speculations ; and therefore, notwithstanding Bentley's bad reputation, he had borrowed money from him. At a subsequent date, when dismissed for his share in these transactions, he complained that on the goldfields they were all more or less like him, and he had been the scapegoat of quite a crowd who were worse than himself. There can be no doubt that his character was corrupt and dishonest. The diggers were indignant at the miscarriage of justice ; they held a meeting on the spot where Scobie was killed. A bosom friend of the murdered man, named Kennedy, harangued the crowd as to the merits of the departed Scotsman, and with a rough but genuine eloquence moved them to indignation. The ghost of the worthy Scobie he declared to be hovering round the spot ; at this time sober, but on the quest for vengeance. An orderly meeting carried a resolution that, not being satisfied with the way in which the proceedings had been conducted either at the inquest or at the trial, it pledged itself to use every lawful means to have the case brought before other and more impartial authorities. For that purpose a committee was appointed, containing, among others, Peter Lalor, T. D. Wanliss, and Wilson Gray. Two hundred pounds were subscribed for the purpose in Ballarat, and all things seemed likely to proceed with order and in their constituted course.' But, unluckily, a crowd gathered in the afternoon round the Eureka Hotel, mostly idlers who went out of curiosity, and stayed only for the purpose of calling \" boo-hoo\" whenever there was a sign of Bentley or his wife about the place. About four o'clock there appeared a body of troopers to disperse them. They claimed the right to stay where they were, as they were doing no harm. The troopers rode into the crowd and tried to scatter it, when a lad, out of mischief, threw a stone at a lamp in front of the hotel. At the sound of falling glass the multitude, in anger at the troopers, joined in the mischief ; window after window was smashed, till not a pane was left. A wild excitement now began. The crowd swarmed into the hotel, clamorous for Bentley, whom they talked of hanging. The police could no longer keep them in check. In a minute all the furniture, bedding, and crockery were thrown out into the roadway. Commissioner Rede arrived and spoke to the crowd. He was unpopular ; no one would listen to him ; indeed, it is said he was pelted by some of the rougher of the crowd. Just then the cry arose that the hotel was on fire ; certain of the diggers had gone round to the bowling alley, placed some papers under the canvas roof, and set fire to them. In that dry weather the place was soon ablaze. Bentley and his wife meantime had escaped, and that but narrowly, to the Government camp. The crowd had done them no violence, but had destroyed their property. It waited to see the building burnt to the ground. Then came a company of the 40th Regiment. The redcoats deployed and advanced as if for an attack. But the officer, afraid to take the responsibility of bloodshed, marched them back to the camp. When the fire was extinct and the evening well advanced, the crowd returned to their homes, well satisfied with their afternoon's work. Sir Charles Hotham looked on this as no ordinary tumult, but a deliberate attempt to 'Withers' \"History of Ballarat,\" p. 83."], [385, "THE ERA OF DEMOCRACY.\u2014 1854 TO 1860. 363 introduce what the Californians called Lynch Law into the goldfields. He hurried up troops to Ballarat, and in four days, what with police and military combined, there were not fewer than 450 men at the camp. Pie might have sympathised, however, with the diggers, for he himself was very certain that Dewes had been acting a scoundrelly part, and had purposely acquitted Bentley, well knowing him to be guilty. He had received a protest from Johnstone, who had been on the bench with Dewes. He had appointed a board, consisting of E. P. S. Sturt, F. A. Powlctt, and Dr. M'Crae, to inquire into the conduct of Dewes. That board soon sent in its report. Dewes had taken bribes; so had the serjeant-major of the police; the coroner had been most indiscreet, though there was against him no evidence of corruption. Hotham dismissed Dewes; punished and dismissed Serjeant-Major Milne; reprimanded the coroner, and directed the re-arrest of Bentley, his wife, and his lodger, Farrell. All this gave the miners much satisfaction; but they were not pleased when three of their number, named M'Intyre, Fletcher and Westerby, were arrested for burning the Eureka Hotel. The selection was made somewhat arbitrarily. The rumour went among the diggers that M'Intyre, though at the scene of the fire-raising, had tried as well as he could to prevent the crowd from carrying out any further mischief. These men, however, were taken to Melbourne, tried, and found guilty, though the jury added a rider that these painful circumstances would never have occurred if those entrusted with the Government offices at Ballarat had done their duty properly. However, the judge passed sentence. M'Intyre was to be imprisoned for three months, Fletcher for four, and Westerby for six. At the same Criminal Sessions, Bentley, his wife, Farrell and another named Hanse, were put on their trial for the murder of Scobie. Mrs. Bentley was acquitted, but the other three were condemned to three years' hard labour on the roads. In these proceedings there was every reason to judge that the authorities at Melbourne were doing all in their power to secure a wise administration of justice, and everything might have gone well but for the feeling which prevailed at Ballarat that it was unfair for three men to suffer severely for doing that which so many had had a share in. They felt it due to their honour not to suffer three of their number to lie in prison without protest, while they who were equally to blame, if blame there were, went about their daily business and their daily pleasures. They held a meeting, appointed three delegates \u2014 George Black, the editor of the Diggers Advocate ; Thomas Kennedy, the chartist Scotchman, who had seen the ghost of Scobie; and John B. Humffray, a well-educated Welshman, and secretary of what was now beginning to be called the Ballarat Reform League. These delegates met the Governor, who was accompanied by W. F. Stawell, the Attorney- General, and John Foster, the Colonial Secretary. They had a long conference at the Government offices, and submitted a resolution of the meeting from which they were delegates. This resolution demanded the liberation of M'Intyre, Fletcher and Westerby. Hotham at once objected to the word \"demand.\" He intimated plainly enough that if a proper memorial had been addressed to him he would have complied with it; but when these men were duly tried and found guilty by a British jury; when they had received from a judge, who had heard all the evidence, a punishment which was the lightest the law provided for, he could not listen to any \"demand\" for their release. The deputation withdrew after expressing their regret that their message had not been more carefully worded. Meantime a great deal of political agitation was being mixed up with this, which was, properly speaking, only a personal matter. The first great meeting of the Ballarat Reform"], [386, "364 VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS. PAST AND PRESENT. League had been held on the nth November. Ten thousand men are said to have gathered on Bakery Hill. They carried resolutions that it is the inalienable right of every citizen to have a voice in making the laws he is called upon to obey ; that there should be no taxation without representation, and that therefore the following political changes should be demanded: \u2014 I. A full and fair representation. 2. Manhood suffrage. 3. Abolition of property qualification for members of the Legislature. 4. Payment of members. 5. Short duration of Parliament. In addition to these the Ballarat Reform League demanded an immediate alteration in the government of the goldfields, and the total abolition of the license tax. They were acting strictly within their legal rights in forming a league to agitate for these alterations ; but unluckily there was at the meeting some talk of a revolutionary character, and Hotham seems to have fired up at what was after all only some irresponsible stuff imported from the Chartist agitations in England. He, however, despatched more military to Ballarat. He ahead)- had 450 men there, but he hurriedly sent off a detachment of the 1 2th Regiment; they travelled in vans for greater expedition. The miners looked on the concentration of troops upon the goldfield as a threat intended to suppress freedom of discussion, and when the news passed from mouth to mouth that reinforcements were coming to the already large force in the camp, their indignation burst forth with warmth. As the carts, each drawn by three horses, and filled with redcoats, reached the Warrenheip Gully, the cry of \" Joe\" began to echo hoarsely over the field, and a great crowd of miners left their work to line the road, and see the force defile on its way to the camp. By an unfortunate impulse, a few of the more forward threw pieces of clay and mud at the occupants of the waggons ; stones and broken bottles followed. Further on upon the goldfield, a number of the gravel-pits men heard the tumult, and gathering in a crowd, intercepted the first of the carts, and upset it. They took the weapons and ammunition from the soldiers, who escaped and hid themselves, as the other carts were detained some distance behind. The officer in charge got his men out, and formed them in line, but they were badly ordered, and seemed disconcerted and confused. The scene degenerated into a mere riot, for which the rougher and less respectable portion of the diggers were responsible, the leaders of the league being conspicuous on the other hand for their efforts to prevent disorder. In the scuffle, six of the soldiers were wounded with pistol shots, one of whom afterwards died ; it was only with a slow progress and great labour that the soldiers reached the vicinity of the camp. Then the mounted troopers made a sortie, and charging in among the crowd, wounded a number of men. The detachment was safely received into the camp at eleven o'clock in the evening, and anxious watch was there maintained throughout the darkness, while the more foolish of the diggers celebrated the affair all night long as a triumph for the populace. Unluckily, next morning, Wednesday the 29th November, was the time appointed by the, meeting to receive the reply of the delegates sent to Melbourne. About midday they gathered, at least ten thousand, round a platform from which floated only the Australian flag, its blue folds and snow-white stars meaning mischief. They waited quietly till the delegates who had just come up by the coach from Geelong had had time to join the meeting. Then Timothy Hayes was voted to the chair. The report of the delegates was heard attentively. They did the Governor full justice, but said that he was powerless to grant their demands ; indignant speeches followed from Lalor, Vern, Brady, Kennedy, Humffray, Ross, and others. A resolution was carried that the members of the League should all forthwith burn their licenses, and pledge themselves to take out no more. The greatest enthusiasm prevailed. Fires were lit there"], [387, "THE ERA OF DEMOCRACY.\u2014 1854 TO 1860. 365 and then, and the licenses contemptuously tossed into them by the score. It was unanimously agreed that if military or police should arrest any man for having no license the entire league would unite in his defence. When these and other resolutions were declared to have been carried, volleys of firearms discharged into the air indicated the diggers' delight. But on the whole the meeting passed off quietly. The authorities had detachments of troops and police stationed all round the place lest disturbances should occur, but they were not needed. How ever, the general aspect of affairs looked so serious that two Catholic clergymen, Archbishop Goold and the Rev. Mr. Downing, hearing that Irishmen were principally concerned in this agitation, hastened up from Melbourne, and travelled day and night to reach the scene of trouble before collision and bloodshed should occur. During the night there was strict watch kept at the camp, and screens of sand-bags, and sacks of flour were thrown up around the tents, and along the verandahs of the wooden buildings. But the morning dawned without any mishap. All eyes were, however, directed towards the next \"digger-hunt.\" If the diggers kept their promise there must then be a decided conflict. The authorities resolved that the crisis should at once be brought to a head, and ordered a \"digger hunt\" for the Gravel Pits district next day, Thursday, the 30th November \u2014 the last that ever took place. The miners were all quietly at work when the cry of \"Joe\" echoed from pit to pit. It was assistant commissioner Johnstone with a body of police. He was pelted with stones, and compelled to withdraw. Commissioner Rede then took a much larger body of police to his support, and marching down, met a great crowd of diggers on the road. He harangued them, and told them he must carry out the law. He appealed to the well-disposed to retire, and many did so ; but others kept their places. He read the Riot Act, and sent a message for the military to come up. The crowd dispersed. Captain Thomas brought a large force of redcoats on the field ; the infantry extended in skirmishing order across all the flat, with cavalry at the wings and in the centre to act as supports. No resistance was made. The troops swept the field, and Mr. Johnstone made the diggers show their licenses, those who had none escaping as well as they could. Eight prisoners were taken, and with these in charge the police returned to the camp. But the diggers had now to make good their promise. Eight of their comrades were in gaol. There was a general agitation on other parts of the goldfield. At three o'clock in the afternoon an impromptu meeting was held again on Bakery Hill round the plat form whereon the Australian flag once more floated. Peter Lalor, an Irishman, son of a former member of the House of Commons, became the guid ing spirit. He mounted the platform, and called upon the diggers to fall into companies and prepare for drill. About five hundred at once complied. Lalor, standing with the butt 01 his gun resting on his foot, and the muzzle in his hand, addressed them. He warned them that a collision was inevit able, but entreated them to let no destruction of property or pillage or plunder sully the cause they were to fight for.\" HON, PETER LALOR, 1887, \u2022All this account is compiled mainly from official reports published in the House of Commons papers for 1855, and from the report of the Royal Commission, but with many details drawn from Carboni Raffaello's \" Eureka Stockade,\" T.K55 ; Withers' \"History of Ballarat,\" second edition, 1SS7 ; and M'Combie's \"History of Victoria, 1858.\""], [388, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 366 At a meeting held in Diamond's store, Lalor had been appointed commander. He now directed that all who were prepared to fight should swear to be faithful to their standard\u2014 the Southern Cross ; that all others should retire. The companies then formed in order round the flagstaff ; each advanced in turn ; its leader repeated an oath to fight and defend their rights and liberties, and the miners kneeling with heads uncovered answered with a deep Amen. In all this there was much that seems to us fantastic ; they were to some extent only playing at rebellion. But they were very much in earnest, and the five hundred hands that pointed up at the streaming standard were ready for grim work. All of them knew that by the law of the land their lives were forfeit if they miscarried in their venture. Foolish as the effort now seems to us, they were actuated by ardent motives ; it was a pity that warmth of feeling had urged them into a course that was absurdly precipitate. For the reforms they wished would all have come without this marshalling in military fashion\u2014 more slowly, no doubt, but more securely. For Hotham had already appointed a commission of inquiry to make a careful examination into the grievances of the miners. W. C. Haines had been selected as its chairman ; William Westgarth, John Fawkner, James M'Culloch, William H. Wright (who was the chief commissioner of goldfields) Edward Grimes (the auditor-general), and James F. Strachan, were chosen as members. The commission, however, was afterwards constituted differently, for so soon as Hotham understood that the miners despaired of receiving justice from a commission of which half were Government officials, he readjusted the list, and William Westgarth became chairman; Fawkner, Strachan, and Wright were left as before, but John Hodgson and John O'Shanassy took the places of Haines and M'Culloch, while Charles W. Carr was added as secretary to the commission. Thus Hotham showed a sincere desire to do substantial justice. He directed the commission to determine the most suitable method of levying that tax which the miner was in honour bound to pay as the price of order and protection ; to inquire into the feasibility of granting mining leases in order to encourage the investment of capital on the goldfields ; and to inquire into the conduct of the officials complained of. It was fortunate for the colony that its Governor was a man with these views and sympathies. For the issue of this commission a fortnight before the collisions at Ballarat disarmed the great bulk of the miners, and converted what might have been a formidable explosion into a small conflict, lamentable but hopeless. A different tone on the part of the Governor would assuredly have gathered from five to twenty thousand miners, according to the degree of exasperation they received ; and a month or two of disorder, and a miserable amount of bloodshed, would assuredly have ensued. As it was, the more thoughtful, the more sensible of the miners, withdrew from the hot-headed five hundred who had reached the ridiculous conclusion that only the sword could secure the redress of their grievances. The great bulk of the Ballarat Reform League declined to imitate their fiery zeal ; even its secretary, J. B. Humffray, disapproved of the violence which his friends were aiming at. All reasonable people were content to wait till the new commission had finished its labours, and furnished its report ; and therefore, though there were fifty thousand discontented miners, though there were twenty thousand not disinclined to resist what they regarded as oppression, yet only five hundred responded to the call to arms. Probably not even these would have gathered had it not been that there was so much distrust of some of the members of the new commission of inquiry. However, the afternoon of that Thursday was spent by the ardent spirits in drilling upon the slope of Bakery PI ill. In the evening strong arms carried bundles of slabs that had been"], [389, "THE ERA OF DEMOCRACY.\u2014 1834 TO 1860. 367 intended for shafts, and threw them down on the Eureka Plateau, to be used in raising a palisade for defence when the military should attack. All night long the men from a distance continued to drop in, some with firearms, some with rudely-manufactured pikes ; as the darkness deepened, the numbers steadily increased, till there were eight hundred men present within the space marked out for a stockade ; vigorous drill went on by lamp-light and the gleam of fires. A meeting of the council was held ; it was resolved to send a deputation to the camp to demand the release of the eight prisoners, and an assurance that in the meantime there should be no more license hunting until the decision of the Legislature could be made known. George Black and Carboni Raffaello were chosen for that purpose, and Father Smyth, a popular clergyman, accompanied them. Under a placid moon they made their way to the lines of the camp, which had been heavily barricaded during the afternoon. They reached the presence of Commissioner Rede, and Black remonstrated with him on the imprudence of sending soldiers with bayonets to inspect licenses in the midst of a body of exasperated diggers. He concluded by demanding the release of all the miners apprehended that morning. Mr. Rede was indignant at such a message. The men had been legally apprehended, and must be legally acquitted before they could be discharged. Black then asked for an assurance that in the meantime there should be no more digger-hunting. Rede replied that it was all nonsense to pretend that the diggers' agitation was intended solely to secure the abolition of the license fee. He knew that it was \"a strong democratic agitation by an armed mob.\" Raffaello allowed that there were indeed other subjects of contention. The miners wished to be enfranchised, and they all re-echoed the cry \"unlock the lands.\" But these questions were not immediately pressing; the diggers were in arms solely to secure the abolition, in the present, of digger-hunting. Rede was courteous, and even considerate to them, but was firmly of opinion that his duty forbade him to give any pledge of the kind required. Far on in the evening a meeting was held to receive the delegates. Their answer was heard in silence, and the meeting was adjourned to next morning at five o'clock. At that hour a crowd again gathered and commenced their drill. The slabs that were lying in disorder began to be set up in a close palisade. At ten o'clock the rumour spread that the soldiers were setting out from the camp on another digger-hunt. All work was stopped on the goldfields, and a time of painful suspense occurred ; but the rumour was false, and the day passed quietly. But at the camp there were breastworks raised with firewood and trusses of hay and bags of corn, to make all ready ; for it was unknown how many thousands there might be of insurgents, and an attack was expected, for the release of the prisoners. The diggers, however, had no such design ; they were busy throwing up their stockade, within which a German blacksmith worked incessantly making pikes for those who had no firearms. On receipt of news from Ballarat Sir Charles Hotham at once despatched all the remaining troops from Melbourne. Several companies of the 12th and 40th regiments with two field pieces and two howitzers set out for the goldfield, together with a company of marines. Major-General Sir Robert Nickle went with them to assume the chief command. Meantime the diggers also had been reinforced, but not to the same useful purpose. Four hundred men from Creswick arrived, but they had with them no provisions and little in the way of weapons. They head expected everything to be provided in plenty at Ballarat ; but the diggers there were themselves inadequately supplied. They shared their quarters as well as they could, however, with their Creswick comrades, and fur those who could not find a tent to sleep in a large bonfire was lit, round which they slept in tolerable comfort in spite of a three hours' Vol. I. 2 v"], [390, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 368 thunderstorm. But these new comers, not liking the general prospect of discomfort and failure, mostly returned on the following day. During the evening the soldiers at the camp saw signals flashed across the goldfields from tent to tent, and seared that arrangements were being made for a night attack, and the troopers, each beside his horse, were stationed as outposts in dreary inactivity throughout a dark and rainy night. During the whole of Saturday drilling went on in the stockade, but all anxiety was at an end in the camp, when it gradually became known that only a small fraction of the diggers were in arms \u2014 that not more than seven or eight hundred at the utmost were concerned in the rebellion \u2014 while there were nearly eight hundred soldiers and constables in the camp, infinitely better armed and disciplined ; others were on their way to Ballarat. The diggers resolved to intercept these reinforcements, which must pass with their cannon along the road from Melbourne. The stockade was enlarged so as to stretch across that road, and Frederick Vern, a Hanoverian of turgidly revolutionary instincts, took command of a detachment to guard the road. But so little of true military management was there in the place that at midday almost all went off to their dinners in various parts of Ballarat, and left the place deserted. They came back by twos and threes, and at four o'clock there appeared a corps of Californians, two hundred of them, in something like uniform, and all armed with revolvers. The stockade grew noisy ; marching and countermarching ; stentorian orders and clumsy evolutions \u2014 a crowd of people all busily managing and yet nothing being managed properly The diggers now themselves felt that the struggle would be unequal. They wanted more arms and more ammunition. They sent out men to press for both of these requirements, and an armed body proceeded to the camp of Commissioner Amos, which was detached, and not far from the stockade ; they took him prisoner and brought him to the camp ; but let him go, keeping his horse and arms however. Father Smyth visited the stockade in the afternoon, and warned the diggers of the madness of their attempt. He advised all those of his denomination to be at mass on the following morning, and to abandon their desperate plan. Till midnight the miners kept watch upon the Melbourne road, but, as the night was cold and dreary, and there was little sleeping accommodation in the stockade, the great bulk of them withdrew to their various homes, leaving only about one hundred and fifty to guard their fortress which was badly constituted and on an ill chosen situation. Captain Thomas, who was in command at the camp, resolved to strike his blow at daybreak. He gathered an attacking party of two hundred and seventy-six men \u2014 eighty-seven of the 40th Regiment under Captain Wise, sixty-five of the 12th under Captain Oueade, thirty cavalry, twenty-four foot police, and seventy mounted troopers. The sun was not yet risen, but it was fully light ; it was chilly, and the soil was wet under foot, when they set out on their march at three o'clock in the morning. Half-an-hour brought them within three hundred yards of the stockade, still unnoticed. They halted while detachments extended in skirmishing order. The mounted men were sent to move round by the left as if to attack the stockade on that side, while the real attack was to be made by the foot soldiers right in front. These dispositions made, the tramp of the soldiers moving forward was heard as a muffled sound, when a single shot fired into the air by an insurgent sentry warned the defenders that the crisis had come. They rushed from their various resting places to man the stockade. They saw a line of redcoats approaching, and when these were 1 50 yards distant a little fellow, formerly a barber, coolly fired at the nearest officer, who fell. At that signal a volley rattled irregularly through the palisades, and several soldiers dropped. The bugle sounded the order to commence"], [391, "THE ERA OF DEMOCRACY.\u2014 1854 TO 1S60. 369 firing, and a sharp volley rang out from the long red line of troops, who then continued to advance, firing incessantly for about ten minutes. Lalor by this time was at his post within the stockade. He climbed on a heap of palisades that lay beside an empty claim. As he stood looking over the fence, in order to see what dispositions were necessary, a soldier picked him off with a bullet, and he fell apparently dead. The diggers behind their palisade had a favourable situation, and so long as the conflict was with firearms they could hold their own. But then came the ominous sound of the fixing of bayonets ; \"charge\" was the word that rang out, and with a loud cheer the soldiers rushed for the fence. It offered no difficulty ; they easily STORMING THE EUREKA STOCKADE, 3RP DECEMBER, 1854. leaped over, and found that those diggers who had guns were without bayonets, while the number who were armed with pikes was inconsiderable. When the troops were over, therefore there was no defence ; a few diggers made a slight stand behind a cart, but most retreated to the empty claims, or behind the hillocks of clay that dotted the enclosure. The soldiers ferretted them out, and hand-to-hand encounters took place, the diggers in the end being generally bayonetted by the soldiers. A policeman climbed the flagstaff, and brought down the Southern Cross amid a wild hurrah from his comrades. Meanwhile the great body of the insurgents had withdrawn to a cluster of tents beside the blacksmith's shop. The troops set fire to the canvas, and as the diggers rushed out pistol conflicts and duels with pike against bayonet took place; but in ten minutes after the charge the fighting was all over. Many of"], [392, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 370 the insurgents had escaped, but one hundred and twenty-five were captured. About forty men were lying in pools of blood here and there in the enclosure; eleven of them lay dead close by the stockade. The troops first marched their prisoners off to the camp, and then a detachment returned with stretchers for the wounded. Peter Lalor, during the confusion, had been dragged by some of his friends out of the way, and covered over with some loose palisades. While the troops were gone he managed to crawl out, and ere they came back he was out on the flat and among crowds of peaceful diggers. Ere nightfall he escaped into the ranges, where a doctor amputated for him his left arm. In the afternoon there was the melancholy task of burying the dead, whose livid features lay upturned on the scene of conflict. Only one soldier had been killed outright ; a great crowd of diggers looked on in respectful silence as his body was buried in the cemetery. Then came the bodies of fourteen diggers, all found dead within the stockade. But that represented only part of the loss of life ; for of the sixteen soldiers carried off the field severely wounded, four subsequently died ; and Captain Wise lingered but a few days, when he too succumbed to the effects of two wounds he had received. He was buried with military honours, also in the rustic cemetery. Of thirty diggers severely wounded, eight subsequently died, including that Lieutenant Ross who had been the standard-bearer of the insurgents. The total number killed on both sides was twenty-eight. Many years after, there were erected suitable memorials, when that little burial ground had become the spacious necropolis of a great city \u2014 a memorial to the soldiers, and a memorial to the diggers, whose struggle, pitiful in many respects, was yet destined to result in important changes. Not in the way their impetuosity led them to dream of; not by arms, nor by disorder; but by the calm, yet determined exercise of constitutional means. In the end the diggers secured a moral triumph. Four days after the fatal Sunday morning the Royal Commission appeared at Ballarat to inquire into the grievances of the goldfields. They took abundance of evidence \u2014 patiently sifted all the troubles that agitated the miner's mind, and in March 1855 handed in a report that met his wishes in every way. It stated that the unseemly violence with which the license fee was often collected from month to month had, naturally enough, exasperated the miners ; that the high price of living consequent on the scarcity of farm produce, due to the inadequacy of the supply of the land offered for sale, had caused a great deal of distress among many of those diggers who had not been exceptionally fortunate ; and lastly, that the want of all political rights and recognised status was naturally felt as a grievance by a body of men who were unusually intelligent and active. It proposed that the license fee be abolished ; but that the public right to the property of gold found upon waste land should still be vindicated by demanding a registration fee of one pound per year from every miner employed in digging ; that no active means should be taken to compel this payment for what was no longer to be called a license, but to be in future a \"miner's right\"; yet it was to be understood that no digger not possessed of such a document should be considered as being entitled to dig for gold ; if he found another miner infringing on his claim or in any way interfering with his work, he could not demand the protection of the law, he not being legally qualified to act as a digger ; and again the possession of a miner's right should be necessary before he could be permitted to vote in any election. The commission recommended that wherever it was possible land should be freely sold at not less than .\u00a31 per acre, so that the digger who wished to invest his earnings, who desired to remain in the colony though abandoning the search for gold, should be able to secure"], [393, "THE ERA OF DEMOCRACY\u2014 1854 TO 1860. 371 for himself a farm, and assist in the development of the country. It was also proposed that the miner should by the mere possession of a \" miner's right\" be entitled to vote in political elections. Finally, the commission suggested to the Government the propriety of granting a general amnesty to the prisoners taken at the Eureka stockade. The whole report was conceived in a very democratic spirit, and was so hostile to the officialism which had been rampant on the goldfields, that Mr. Wright, the chief commissioner, who was a member, refused to sign it. But this is scarcely to be wondered at, when such cases were embodied in the report as that of a commissioner who caused a young man to be arrested for riding past him without taking any notice of him. This commissioner justified his action. He said that he had been sitting under a tree reading a newspaper before his tent, when the young man came galloping past, raising a great dust, and taking not the slightest notice of him, the commissioner. The report has some of the characteristics of Fawkner's handiwork : its keenness, its bitterness, its somewhat vulgar aggressiveness, recall the convicts' advocate of the Launceston days, twenty years before. Its recommendations were by no means palatable to the members of the Government. There was scarcely so much as a passing reflection against the diggers, or even the tumultuous few who had levied war against the authorities. But by implication the Government was at every turn condemned ; and that condemnation was generally assented to, not on the goldfields alone, but in the cities also. When the news reached Melbourne that the diggers were in arms, a vision of twenty thousand stalwart miners, gay with sashes, flourishing revolvers, jubilant with victory, had alarmed the merchants and property-holders of Melbourne. But even there the sympathies of the great majority, including a large portion of the wealthier and professional classes, were with the diggers. The mayor called a meeting to provide for the defence of the city if it should be attacked. Many members of the Legislative Council were present, and the proceedings commenced with the adoption of resolutions intended to strengthen the hands of the Government. But when two had been passed, and a third was being discussed, the real temper of the meeting displayed itself. Amidst great confusion the mayor vacated the chair, which was taken by Dr. Embling, and a series of resolutions were passed, expressing sympathy with the diggers, and calling upon the Government to take speedy measures for the redress of their grievances. Those who had promoted this meeting were dissatisfied with the result, and thought that a crowd of agitators had burst in upon a meeting of persons mostly of opposite views, and had by mere noise carried the resolutions in their own way. But they were undeceived on the following day, when they convened a monster meeting to be held where St. Paul's Cathedral is now rising. Five thousand persons gathered there on that Wednesday afternoon ; but over night there had come the news of the conflict at the stockade on the previous Sunday, much exaggerated of course, the rumour being that from fifty to a hundred miners had been killed ; and there had come also the news that on Monday the whole Buninyong district had been proclaimed under martial law. The seeling of the meeting was extremely hostile to the Government. A resolution was passed condemning the miners for their appeal to arms, but others expressed disapproval of the coercive measures adopted by the Government ; the speakers were John Fawkner, David Blair, Thomas Fulton, Dr. Embling and others, and the tone of their addresses was anything but complimentary to the authorities. Hotham was suspicious of the temper and probable movements of this meeting. He therefore had a strong force at hand for emergencies. All round the place of meeting he had"], [394, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLLS: PAST AND PRESENT. 372 posted bodies of men fully armed. Three hundred police and one hundred warders drafted from the gaols were stationed hard by. One hundred gentlemen, well mounted, who had volunteered to assist, were within easy distance; while the seamen and marines of Her Majesty's ships Electra and Fantome mounted guard over the treasury and the powder magazines. But the proceedings were orderly, and these precautions proved unnecessary. Similar meetings had taken place in Geelong and in Sandhurst, and resolutions had been adopted in strong condemnation of the Government ; not that the people had any sympathy with an armed rebellion, for when Hotham called for special constables, no less than 1500 responded in Melbourne alone, and Geelong provided a like proportion. Rioting and sedition would find no favour. But the general conduct of the Government had roused a feeling of antagonism greatly in excess of anything that was really deserved ; and there was one member of the Cabinet who met with no mercy in the fierce denunciations of speakers and of press. That was the Colonial Secretary, John Foster, the same who had stood as a candidate for Melbourne, when the people wanted no candidate, and when they had elected Earl Grey in preference. He was a man of no special ability, and he probably had no great share in moulding the policy of the Government ; that was mainly the work of Stawell \u2014 the strongest, the ablest, but also the most impetuous and uncompromising of the ministers. But it was to P'oster, who held the position of Premier, that the people looked for that advice which a new Governor would especially need, and which a wise Governor would wish to follow. On Foster's head, therefore, gathered the storm. He endured it only a day or two, and then on the 9th of December 1854, six days after the conflict at the Eureka stockade, he sent a letter to the Governor, stating that as the popular feeling against him was very strong, he would be willing to resign his position if such a course seemed likely to free His Excellency from any embarrassment. Hotham was glad of the opportunity ; he had probably no very exalted opinion of his minister's capacity, and he confessed that the hostility against him was widespread and intense. He therefore accepted his resignation, promising, however, to secure him compensation for his loss of office ; but at a subsequent date, when he asked the Legislature to vote him two years' salary as a solatium, that body declined. Meantime, William Clark Haines was chosen as the new Colonial Secretary. He was one of the non-official nominee members of the Legislative Council ; a position to which he had been called from an unsuccessful attempt at farming on the Barrabool Hills. He was a man whose thorough uprightness of intention secured for him the designation of \" Honest Haines,\" but as he had always been a silent member, and was reckoned as inane as upright, his appointment was a surprise to the community, who, however, waited patiently to see how it would result. WILLIAM CLARK HAINE Meantime, all signs of disorder had disappeared at Ballarat. Sir Robert Nickle had arrived two days after the conflict with the rest of the 99th Regiment. A parade took place\u2014 about a thousand men in all; the diggers manifested no ill-will. The major-general was kindly and judicious. By his advice martial law was revoked three days after its proclamation ; and all alarm of further sedition was at an end. But the trial of the prisoners was a subject that engaged general attention. On the Wednesday and Thursday following the affair at the"], [395, "THE ERA OF DEMOCRACY.\u2014 1854 TO 1860. 373 stockade, 113 were brought up in batches. A hundred were released, and thirteen remanded for trial. These were all of them moving spirits in the rising, but the actual leaders were not there. Though five hundred pounds had been offered for the capture of Vern, who by his braggadoccio had spread the belief that he was the commander-in-chief of the insurgents, yet no one betrayed him. He adopted a ruse to make it believed that he had sailed from the colony, but he lurked for months among the tents at Ballarat, hidden by his friends and sharing their fare. Two hundred pounds each had been offered for the capture of Peter Lalor and George Black, but they, too, had staunch friends up amongst the ranges, who concealed them till all trouble had blown over. The thirteen destined for trial were removed to Melbourne, where the)' were placed in gaol during the Christmas recess to wait for the next criminal sessions. An address was presented to the Governor by 4500 inhabitants of Ballarat, desiring him to grant a general amnesty. The Royal Commission on the goldfields made the same request, but Hotham declined to interfere with the law. With kindness and respect he received the delegates sent from Ballarat \u2014 J. B. Humffray being their chief spokesman \u2014 but he refused to employ his prerogative as they desired. The prisoners in gaol, however, were not treated as felons, and their condition was made as comfortable as was possible. James Macpherson Grant, a solicitor of Melbourne, undertook to prepare their defence for them, and, equally gratuitously, the witty and popular barrister, Aspinall gave his services as their counsel, Archibald Michie and R. D. Ireland also offering their pro fessional assistance. When the trial came on, the case taken first was that of John Joseph, a negro from Boston, a popular object of good-natured banter on the goldfields. It was clearly proven that he had been firing energetically out of the stockade upon the advancing soldiers. No defence was set up, save that, though he did drill, and help to form a stockade ; though he did fire on the attacking force, and resist desperately when captured, yet he had no treasonable intentions ; the jury accepted that view, and after half-an-hour's deliberation, returned a verdict of \" not guilty.\" A loud peal of applause followed the verdict. Chief-Justice a'Beckett was little pleased with the result of the trial, and he showed his displeasure by committing to gaol for a week the two most uproarious of those who had dared to desecrate his court with applause, and though they humbly petitioned and apologised next day he made them undergo their seven days' imprisonment. The trial of John Manning then came on. He had for his counsel Archibald Michie, an able barrister who, after spending a few years in Sydney, and taking there a prominent part in public affairs, had now settled in Melbourne. He followed the same line of defence. John Manning, an ardent Irishman, the reporter of the Ballarat Times, had indeed been drilled in the pike company, and had fought within the stockade; but he was in arms only for self-defence against license-hunting policemen, and he had attacked nobody. He was acquitted much to the perplexity of Gurner, the Solicitor-General, and of Stawell, the Attorney-General, who were in court conducting the trials. They postponed the other cases, hoping that a new panel would give them juries more disposed to support the Government. A month elapsed, and the trials were resumed before Judge Barry, who won the popular neart by his kindly, courteous, and sympathetic manner, even though he was strictly punctilious and impartial. On 20th March was taken the case of Timothy Hayes, who had been chairman of the meeting at which the licenses had been burnt. He was a very decent fellow, with a family of six children, and a wife who had won the favour of the populace by her efforts to secure the escape of her husband. His case was therefore a difficult one on which to secure a verdict ; though Stawell used all his skill in the prosecution. He was, however, strictly fair, and the"], [396, "VICTORIA AND ITS METRO POLLS: PAST AND PRESENT. 374 evidence he brought forward was conclusive as to the facts. Barry summed up in such a way as to indicate that his sympathies were with the diggers in any constitutional agitation. Indeed, he informed the jury that the mere firing upon Her Majesty's troops did not constitute treason ; that circumstances might justify, and often had justified, resistance. Yet he thought that in strict law the prisoners had at Ballarat been guilty of treason. He, as well as others, \"was anxious to hear, at the hands of the jury, whether the Government of the country might be opposed by armed men, or whether it should be carried on, however obnoxious a minister or his measures might be,\" till that minister was removed or that measure altered by constitutional means. The jury would not take the judge's view. After twenty-five minutes of deliberation, they returned with a verdict of \" not guilty.\" A buzz of approbation filled the court, but the people were cautious ; the word passed out, however, to the great crowd on the street. Loud cheers echoed, and were prolonged. An hour later, when Hayes appeared as a free man, he was conducted in triumph down Stephen-street as a hero of the day. Two days later, Carboni Raffaello appeared to answer a charge of treason. In his case there was much contradictory evidence, but it was clear he had been prominent in the disturbance. Ireland and Aspinall both maintained, however, that he had been abundantly justified in resisting the unconstitutional violence of commissioners and police by the use of force. Barry summed up, taking notice of the fact that Raffaello had come sixteen thousand miles to escape Austrian tyranny, and that he complained of having met oppression not unlike it on the goldfields. The judge, however, pointed out that in a British community there were provided abundant means of agitating in a constitutional manner. But the jury again delivered a verdict of \" not guilty,\" and the Government felt itself completely defeated. The legal advisers of the Crown wished to abandon all the other cases, but Hotham would not permit it. He said that \" if juries would not do their duties, he could discover no reason why he should not do his.\" The trials proceeded, but in a purely formal manner. Each of the prisoners was acquitted in turn, and the popular cause had won a complete triumph. Hotham confessed as much a short time after, when he granted an amnesty to all concerned. From that time forward the era of democracy had fully commenced in Victoria ; the people were completely and without restriction masters of their own course, and able to shape their own destiny. Hotham regarded with dismay the rapid transition that began. \" It is a bad omen,\" he reported to the Colonial Office in London, \" when ordinary justice no longer avails.\" He was despondent as to the future ; he did not believe that the mother country would permit that a colony, a mere corner of the empire, should adopt as its constitution those radical measures which the Chartists had urged, in spite of the opposition, and, indeed, the contempt, of all the educated and wealthy classes of Great Britain. Yet that was the evident course in which affairs in Victoria were drifting, and Hotham had many anxieties as to the degree of responsibility which might be attached to himself. He was more than middle-aged ; he had seen hard service ; he was suffering from a chronic malady, contracted in Africa, and now there came all this turbulency, all this load of cares. His experience of office was anything but agreeable. But fortunately some of his solicitude was groundless. The English Government were resolved to give to the colonies the most ample powers of self-government, and each could make itself as democratic as it pleased. The Imperial Act passed in 1850 had left to each the right to frame its own constitution. Victoria was not slow to accept the invitation. In 1853 a committee of the Legislative Council was appointed to frame the new constitution. Foster was"], [397, "THE ERA OF DEMOCRACY\u2014 1834 TO 1860. 375 its chairman, squatters and nominee members predominated, and as it was still only 1853, the popular agitation had not yet made itself felt. The constitution recommended was, therefore, not peculiarly liberal, but the Legislative Council, wherein the conservative element formed an overwhelming majority, passed it on 15th December 1853 with only slight amendments. It was reserved for the Royal assent, and despatched to England in March 1854 The Queen, however, sent the bill, along with similar measures from the other colonies, to be considered in the English Parliament, which made some slight alterations and approved of it. At the time of the Eureka stockade, therefore, this bill was in England, and long before it returned to the colony its main features were already disowned by the working classes, who now felt that with them lay the balance of political power. According to this bill there were to be two Houses of Legislature, a principle to which the democratic leaders did not object. But no one could be a member of either of these Houses unless the owner of consider able property. The Legislative Council was to consist of thirty members, all possessed of real estate, not less in value than five thousand pounds; the Legislative Assembly was to consist of sixty members, all possessing at least two thousand pounds' worth of real estate. These Houses could therefore be only in part representative of the general feeling of the community; but in addition, the right to vote in their elections was very considerably restricted. No one could vote for a member of the Council who was not possessed of one thousand pounds' worth of property, or who was not a member of the legal, medical, or clerical professions, or a graduate of some university. To exercise the franchise in elections for the Assembly a man required to possess fifty pounds' worth of freehold property, or to lease a house of an annual value of ten pounds. This limitation does not at first sight appear to amount to very much. But it certainly excluded all young men who still lived in their parents' houses, all lodgers, all employees \u2014 such as shepherds, stockmen, and servants of all sorts, who lived on their employers' premises \u2014 and it also excluded the gold-diggers, then one-half of the male population of the colony. It was this circumstance that gave to the agitation at the close of 1854 its political significance. A Legislative Council, not appointed by the people, and with one-third of its members Government nominees, had framed a constitution only a trifle less conservative than that of England. That constitution had been sent home for approval, and when it returned, and was put in force, the prospect certainly seemed to be that it would long continue in force, unless a speedy protest was entered against it. Hence the general agitation of 1854 was intended to proclaim that the constitution thus framed was not the work of the people as a whole, and was distasteful to the majority. Three of the points of the \" Charter\" were strongly emphasised : the people wished for manhood suffrage, the abolition of property qualifications for members of the Legislature, and the use of the ballot at elections. These were the causes of discontent with the great body of the men of the colony; the license-fee and the mode of its collection had given an intensity and a bitterness to the agitation that it might not otherwise have had ; and it was clearly these latter causes that had led to the Eureka stockade; but it must have been very evident to Hotham and the authorities that the democratic spirit was widely spread; that there was danger in unduly checking it; and that indeed some immediate concessions were necessary. In the first place, then, it was arranged that there should be five new members of the old Legislative Council to represent the goldfields until the new Constitution Act returned to take effect. All who had miners' rights were entitled to vote. Ballarat returned J. B. Humffray and Peter Lalor, and when they took their places, it must have been a visible sign that the old era Vol. I. 2 w"], [398, "376 VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. had given place to the new ; the insurgent leader of the diggers, for whom two hundred pounds reward had so recently been offered, now took his seat among the thirty-five who made the laws of the colony ; and to mark the triumph still more strongly, Sandhurst returned James Macpherson Grant, for no other reason than that he had endeared himself to the popular heart by giving his services to the State prisoners in their trial at Melbourne. Another feature of the popular triumph was the abolition of all the great army of officials on the goldfields. Commissioners, and clerks, inspectors of police, with all the host of commissariat officers, and all the military, were withdrawn, and in consequence the goldfields became more orderly. A warden was appointed for each district. Two or three constables served as a terror to evil-doers, but were no threat to the general body of the diggers. But confidence was renewed by the elevation to the magistracy of some of the well educated and more influential diggers ; while novel tribunals called Local Courts were established. These were elected by the miners themselves, the first at Ballarat being chosen by a show of hands in a dense meeting upon Bakery Hill. As a rule, their members were miners, Raffaello being one of the first court elected at Ballarat, and Duncan Gillies commencing his public career in that capacity. The duty of these courts was to adjudicate on all disputes of a mining character that arose on the goldfields. The new constitution at last arrived by the Shalimar on the 16th October 1855. The Governor proclaimed a public holiday, which was very generally kept, although the provisions of the bill were by no means all that the people desired. Yet there was provided in it one notable approximation to a better state of things. In future Victoria was to have responsible cabinets. Until then the Governor had the appointment of ministers in his own hands. No sort of check impeded his choice ; and the people had not the smallest voice in the nomination of their rulers. Henceforth the English practice was to prevail. But there was destined to be some jolting before the vehicle of State was to pass from the old rails to the new. It would have been better if the system of Responsible Government had not come into force until after the elections had taken place, when a ministry might have been formed out of the two Houses which the people should have returned. But it was alleged that the inauguration of the new system was compulsory immediately after the proclamation of the constitution. The Governor's advisers assured him that it was so. Unfortunately, Sir Charles was becoming more and more unwell ; the strain of unaccustomed work was beginning to tell. The siege of Sebastopol had been going on all that year. From afar he had heard in fancy the booming of the thousand cannon and the hoarse roar of trampling hosts round the Malakoff and the Redan. That was more to his taste than this pettifogging constitution-manufacture, accompanied by what was particularly distasteful to a captain of the Royal Navy\u2014 domination by a populace not peculiarly respectful. But the Colonial Office would not yet release him, and he continued to toil each day far on into the midnight, trying to give to all the offices of his Government his own personal supervision, and endeavouring to master thoroughly and without danger of surprise all the intricacies of this trying time of legislation and constitutional change. It was a pity that his advisers were men who had a pecuniary interest in the advice they gave; and though they acted in a strictly legal way \u2014 though they discharged their own consciences of anything unworthy\u2014 yet their course was exactly that which exposed them to the most hostile criticism, among a populace actuated by no friendly feeling towards them. It had been provided by the fiftieth clause of the New Constitution Act that persons released from office on political grounds should be entitled to pensions for life equal to two-thirds of the amount of their salaries if they had enjoyed these salaries for at least two years previously."], [399, "THE ERA OF DEMOCRACY.\u2014 1834 TO 1S60. 377 If the existing ministers, therefore, were now dismissed, they would enjoy their pensions. But if they continued in office till new Houses were elected, and if they were then not approved of by these houses, they must lose their chances of pensions. They therefore advised Sir Charles that he must dismiss them; that was necessary, they maintained, before the new system could come into force. They were \"released from office on political grounds,\" and at once sent in applications for their pensions, which they immediately began to draw, and which three of them still continue to draw after a lapse of thirty-three years. Yet though dismissed they at once came back. Hotham sent for Haines in due constitutional form, and he framed a ministry including his three fellow pensioners\u2014 Stawell, Childers, and Andrew Clarke. Two of these were personally unpopular. Clarke had been the officer who brought over the 99th Regiment from Tasmania to suppress the diggers ; and he was now the Surveyor-General who was COLLINS STREET, MELBOURNE, IN 1S5; generally supposed to be responsible for the scanty supplies of land offered to the public for sale. Stawell had deeply offended the diggers by calling them, with somewhat bitter emphasis \"mere vagabonds\"; it was he who had prosecuted the Eureka stockade prisoners, and though he had then done no more than his duty, he was none the better liked on account of it. Hence, in the Council and in the country, Haines, Stawell, Clarke and Childers were roundly abused, and Hotham was accused of having played into their hands in order to work out a small intrigue. In the Council, a motion of censure against the Government was moved by Dr. Greeves, with Fawkner for a zealous ally. In spite of the solid support of nominee and official members, the motion of censure was rejected by only one vote ; but even that victory served to give existence to the now responsible ministry till after the elections. A new incident, however, occurred to render still muddier the stream of the political current. The Haines Cabinet set itself to frame a new Electoral Bill, which granted some"], [400, "378 VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS : PAST AND PRESENT. concessions to popular desires. But there was one concession earnestly longed for that this bill did not permit; that was the system of voting at elections by secret ballot. All demo cratic ideals included that provision. In no other way could the workman be secure from molestation if he voted in opposition to his employer's wishes; in no other way could the shopkeeper feel himself quite clear of the constraining influence of his wealthier customers ; in no other way could the tenant feel certain that he would not draw down upon his head the wrath of his landlord, whose intimate friend, or political hero, he might wish to vote against. A great meeting had been held to discuss the proposal in 185 1; again and again it had been debated in monster meetings; but the Government refused to include it in their new bill; partly because their sympathies were opposed to democracy, and partly because the practice of voting by secret ballot was not yet adopted by any other country, and they thought that for a small community in an outlying corner of the world to try any risky experiments would be unwise, and possibly result in the disgrace of those who brought so radical a measure into legal operation within the staid and respectable confines of the British Empire. But the people of Victoria were self-reliant and ardent. Little did they care what other people had done or were doing; the ballot, not the open ballot of the United States, but a ballot profoundly secret was absolutely necessary if the electors were to be free to give their unbiassed voices. Mr. William Nicholson, therefore, a popular member of the Council, and formerly mayor of Melbourne, came forward as the champion of the new proposal. At the second reading of the Electoral Bill, on the 18th December 1855, he moved that \"in the opinion of this House, any new Electoral Act should provide for electors recording their votes by secret ballot.\" A vigorous debate followed. The Government found to their delight that Fawkner, Greeves, O'Shanassy and others, who generally opposed them, were adverse to the proposition. They thought themselves secure of an easy victory, and they took a high-handed position. The)- would not insert any such provision in their bill. They would stand or fall by the Act as they had framed it. Much to their surprise, when it came to the vote next day -they were beaten by a heavy majority. Their only course was to resign. In true constitutional fashion the Governor sent for Nicholson, and requested him to form a ministry. That worthy citizen was amazed at the consequences of his action. He had just made arrangements for a trip to Europe. He had no desire to be Chief Secretary. Must he accept all this responsibility because he had moved that inoffensive motion of his? Clearly he must, or else stultify the institution of Responsible Government at its very beginning. Then, of course, he would forego his trip, and do his duty. He tried to form a ministry; but the elements were too incongruous, and those whom he asked knew well that the Legislative Council would soon expire, when, with the advent of a wholly elective system of two chambers, all things would probably be upset. No one wished to join him. A week elapsed, and his task was not completed, when the Governor, now thoroughly ill, and confined to his room, sent a message giving him two days more in which to form his cabinet. Sir Charles had added a new ailment to the chronic complaint that wasted his frame. Nearly a fortnight previously he had gone out to perform the ceremony of formally opening the works of the first gas company of Melbourne. A violent storm of rain, accompanied by a chilly change of weather, gave him a severe cold which lingered for a week or so unnoticed, and then took a form more evident, but still not alarming. On the 28th of December, Dr. M'Crae, his physician, sent word to Nicholson that the Governor was too ill to see anyone; on the next day, Saturday, Dr. M'Crae came, on the Governor's behalf, to ask if Nicholson had yet succeeded. The reply"], [401, "THE ERA OF DEMOCRACY.\u2014 1834 TO 1860. 379 that he had not must have brought worry to the worthy sea captain, who, doubtless, began to wish he had never meddled with these political niceties, for which he had received no training. He was evidently about to be placed in a very difficult position, and a blunder, in face of what he thought a somewhat disloyal community, might have serious and far-reaching effects. So on his sick-bed he fretted and pondered. He dictated for the Colonial Office a report vindicating his own conduct in all these troubles, but he did not live to sign it. On the following morning a fit of epilepsy occurred, and though he lived for a day, he never regained consciousness. On the Monday morning, the last day of 1855, that worn and wasted frame of a man, honourable, upright, and laborious, was still and no more fevered by anxious cogitations as to the path his duty would bid him tread; his career of manful endeavour was ended. He himself had never known he was dying; still less had the public suspected it, and the news that the Governor, so universally feted on his arrival eighteen months before, had succumbed to his worries and his labours, carried through all the sympathies of the people a throb of pathos. All classes mourned that an upright man should have passed away with a feeling of exasperation in his mind against the restless colony he had been sent to govern. According to regulations, the commander of the forces was entitled to occupy the position of Acting-Governor till the arrival of a successor. But worthy old Sir Robert Nickle had also succumbed to his malady, and the temporary dignity passed to Major-General Macarthur, son of old John Macarthur, of Camden Park, who, finding that Nicholson was making little progress, invited Haines to resume his old position. And so the former ministry returned unaltered. Their first duty was to provide for the public funeral of Sir Charles. They secured a vote of fifteen hundred pounds for that purpose, and for the erection of a monument. A few days later a long cortege left the home of the widow, desolate among strangers, to carry the remains of the once popular \" Diggers' Charlie\" across the Prince's Bridge. It was joined by thousands who desired to pay respect to one whom all respected. The sailor Governor was laid to rest in the new cemetery, where a tapering column of gracefully designed granite lifts its ruddy pinnacles high above the dusky-shadowed trees, to mark the tomb of the only Governor who ever died in the colony. In the political world the ballot proposal was still the vexed question. Haines would not adopt the principle, but he ceased to make it a ministerial question. On the 29th of March 1856 the Ballot Act was passed, with careful provisions for its working, and Victoria was the first community to adopt this principle of secret voting. It was immediately put in employment, for the time was at hand for the elections of the two new Houses. Never was an election period known to pass so quietly; on all hands the new Act was declared to have worked most admirably, and yet in no community could there have been more cause for agitation and disorder. Not one question, but a whole crop of them, were before the electors, and all of a kind to deeply touch the feelings of the multitude. John O'Shanassy was one of the first in his speeches to sound the war-note of a fight for manhood suffrage. He was the popular champion, but Archibald Michie and a dozen others joined in the crusade. Their return was certain. James M'Culloch not only advocated manhood suffrage, but he proposed to shorten the duration of Parliament from five to three years, and as another democratic measure, desired the abolition of all State aid to religion. Charles Gavan Duffy had just landed. His career in Ireland, and his short, but lively term of membership in the House of Commons, had marked him out as a prominent advocate of liberal, or rather radical and revolutionary measures. He found a great body of warm admirers, who on"], [402, "380 VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS. PAST AND PRESENT. learning that he was not possessed of the two thousand pounds necessary to qualify him for a seat in the Assembly, united in subscribing that sum twice over for the purpose, and he of course joined ardently in the democratic agitation. When the new Houses met on the 2 ist November 1856, the great majority were pledged to speedy reforms. This was so clearly recognised by Haines, Stawell, and Childers that they resolved to checkmate O'Shanassy and his friends by a bold effort to conciliate to themselves the popular fervour. They brought in a bill to confer the franchise upon \" every male person of the full age of twenty-one,\" a principle which the people, forgetful of the limitation \"male,\" in those days denominated \"universal suffrage.\" A slight counterpoise was provided by giving additional votes to property-holders. Any one who possessed property to the value of fifty pounds in a district was entitled to a vote in that district, even though he had already voted for the district in which he resided. This bill was duly passed, and manhood suffrage, which for the last two years had been inevitable, became the law in Victoria. Terrible results were prophesied by those whose views were cautious and distrustful of these new theories. Their fears have proved unfounded, and the process of legislation and of government has been as orderly in Victoria since then as before, and not less orderly than in the most savoured of civilised communities. But though the bill was port of the cabinet, was now ready to take the vacant posi tion so soon as the ministry should be disbanded. He did not wait for the absolute con clusion of the ministry's exis tence, but took his seat as Chief Justice on the 25th of February 1857, his place being filled for a few days by Thos. H. Fellows. Childers was looking to the English political arena as a wider field for his undoubted abilities and on the same day he retired. Not long afterwards he severed his con nection with the colony, and commenced his notable career in the House of Commons. passed, the ministry could not long hold together. They were too little united among them selves. Their democratic vest ments sat awkwardly on them, and the abler of them had other ambitions than those that lay immediately before them. The Chief Justice, Mr. a'Beckett, was in poor health ; he had long been anxious to retire. Barry was the next in seniority, and Molesworth, who for a time had been Solicitor- General, and now was elevated to the Bench, had also a right of priority ; but Stawell, whose ability had been the main sup- CHIEF JUSTICE SIR W. F. STAWELL Plaines then had no choice but resignation; he retired on the nth of March 1857. O'Shanassy was clearly the leader of the House, and he was sent for by Sir Henry Barkly, the new Governor, to form a ministry. Barkly had arrived on the 26th of December previously. He was welcomed cordially, though not so effusively perhaps as Hotham had been. He was destined to experience comparatively tranquil times ; and yet much credit is to be accorded to his tact, his prudence, his suavity, his careful sagacity. For he had to deal with a somewhat fiery community. Two hundred thousand men had been brought during the last four years to make their homes in the colony. Their average of intelligence and education was much superior to that of the farming labourers, or even the factory operatives who made the mass of the common people in other communities. They were not by any means the plodding bovine creatures who"], [403, "THE ERA OF DEMOCRACY.\u2014 1834 TO 1860 381 thought it ordained from all eternity that they should be ruled by their betters. They took a lively interest in public affairs. They wished a voice in the management of the State ; they were resolved to have it ; and as they vastly overwhelmed in numbers all other bodies in the com munity, they were certain to obtain what they demanded. For five or six years mass meetings were frequent ; on all hands the colony rang with the declamations of men who declined to tolerate the existence of any privileged class among the people. Democratic agitations and political debates made Victoria as lively a community during those years as any that the world contained. Here, then, were all the elements of trouble, if a new Governor had repeated the mistakes of Latrobe or of Hotham. But Sir Henry Barkly, quiet, self-possessed, politic, carried his seven years of office to a successful issue without one instance of discord. While contending parties were keenly struggling, he acted as a careful umpire, and with so much discretion that on his departure all the combatants united in cordial praises of his term of office. But inasmuch as Barkly was content to occupy this position as arbiter, apart from the strife and above it, he entered much less than either of his predecessors into the history of the colony. He made his home at Toorak the centre of many refining influences ; he took a most genuine interest in scientific, literary, and social progress. But his personality was little felt in our story, just as the umpire is scarcely mentioned in recounting the incidents of the game where his integrity and carefulness made all things move smoothly and pleasantly (SIR) JOHN O'SHANASS Sir Henry Barkly sent for John O'Shanassy, who became Chief Secretary and Premier, with six colleagues, including John Foster, Gavan Duffy, and Dr. Greeves. It was a poorly selected team, though the best he could induce to serve. Foster was still most unpopular; Greeves, on going back to his constituents for re-election after taking office, was rejected ; while there was still a considerable body of prejudice in the community against Duffy, whose course was not wholly explicable. He had recently proclaimed in the colony that he was still an Irish rebel to the backbone, yet here on the first chance he accepted an office of profit as Her Majesty's Commissioner of Public Works in the colony. The two things were perhaps not really inconsistent; but as a new arrival in the colony he found hosts of critics, and, if he had warm admirers, he had also bitter opponents, who were sure to put the worst construction upon his acts. At any rate he was no source of strength to the administration, which speedily collapsed, after an existence of less than fifty days. Back came Haines to office, but with a very much stronger cabinet. C. H. Ebden was the Treasurer, a post he filled with skill ; Archibald Michie was Attorney-General, and his debating power was a blessing to his colleagues ; James M'Culloch was Commissioner of Customs, Thomas H. Fellows was Solicitor-General, and W. H. F. Mitchell was Postmaster- General ; all of them men who made their mark in the subsequent politics of the colony. All of them, without exception, were pledged to support the democratic cause, which, therefore, was maintained both by Government and Opposition ; the only thing they could quarrel about was merely the question how far democracy should go. This unanimity carried through another important measure of radical reform without"], [404, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 382 difficulty. In the middle of 1857, Duffy introduced a bill to abolish all property qualification for membership of the Legislative Assembly. If a member must possess two thousand pounds of real estate, the choice of the people was strictly limited to the well-to-do and wealthy classes. The House of Assembly agreed without trouble; an opposition was offered in the Council, but even there the new bill passed by a large majority. This year, therefore, saw the adoption in full of two more of the points of the famous so-called Charter \u2014 manhood suffrage and abolition of property qualification,\u2014 which were now to be added to the system of secret voting by ballot. Next year another democratic step took place, when the maximum duration of the Assembly was shortened from five to three years. But in the meantime further ministerial changes had taken place. After Haines had been in office for nearly a year, he tripped in reference to some small matters in connection with an Electoral Act Amendment Bill, a fifth democratic measure intended to carry out approximately the Chartist idea of dividing the country into districts of approximately equal numbers of electors. He did not oppose the measure, but was beaten in regard to some of its details, and resigned on 24th February 1858. O'Shanassy again became Premier, with George Harker as Treasurer, Gavan Duffy, Henry Miller, R. D. Ireland, and four other colleagues. This ministry carried the electoral districts measure by which the number of members in the assembly was increased from sixty to seventy-eight, and by which, to some extent, the electoral districts were equalised. But O'Shanassy was not thoroughly democratic in his ideas. He was afraid of a pure democracy, and desired to place it under strong checks. He maintained that the Upper House should be kept strictly as the representative of property, and should have full and untram melled power as a court of revision of all that was done in the Lower House. The people generally were not averse to that view, but in carrying it out he lost favour in various ways, and when a new House was elected, at the beginning of October 1859, the first thing it did was to pass a motion of want of confidence in the ministry. William Nicholson was again called on to form a cabinet. This time he was better prepared, and with James M'Culloch, James Service, James G. Francis, and Dr. Greeves to assist him, he managed very well for a year, till in November 1860, he also fell behind in the race for democracy; he did not keep pace with the wishes of the majority in the community, and he disappeared from office, to be succeeded by Richard Heales, under whose leadership, as we shall subsequently see, the colony formulated to the full extent its democratic ideals, and set up a programme which it successfully carried through, though not till Heales himself had long passed away from the scene of conflict. But apart from Parliament and politics, some notable democratic changes had taken place. The most important was that known as the Eight Plours System. The keynote was struck by the stonemasons on the nth April 1856, when they held a meeting and passed resolutions to the effect that in future in their trade eight hours a day for six days should be regarded as a full week's work. Immediately afterwards others of the trades took it up, each passing a similar resolution ; and a few days later a great meeting of all the mechanical trades was held in the Queen's Theatre, John Thomas Smith, the mayor, being in the chair. Dr. Embling spoke, and Mr. Winter, and Osborne and Taylor, and Cox and Forsyth. Amid great acclamation the resolution was passed that all the trades would adhere to the new system. The Eight Hours League was formed. A prize was offered for the best essay on the subject, in which it was to be fully kept in view that Victoria was preparing to try an experiment never tried before, and that if the result was favourable, it might induce other"], [405, "THE ERA OF DEMOCRACY.\u2014 1854 TO 1860. 383 communities to make the same experiment. The trades then gave notice to all the employers that from and after the 21st of April, 1856, they would work only eight hours a day. Some of the contractors complained that the change would be a heavy loss to them, as they had accepted large contracts, calculating expenses at the former rates. The stonemasons passed a resolution reducing their wages till existing contracts should be completed. The tradesmen completely succeeded in their wishes, but the shopkeepers, who made a similar effort, were not so fortunate. They were even earlier in the field. They formed the \"Early Closing Association\" in 1855. The Acting-Governor, Major-General Macarthur, was the patron ; Bishop Perry, Judges Barry and Williams and Molesworth, and indeed all the prominent men of the colony, took an interest more or less active. Many a public meeting was held ; much speaking, much printing, much bill-posting, sailed to do more than partially rouse and educate the public mind, and a generation had to pass before they got what they wanted. The working classes as a body showed little consideration for the shopkeeper and his assistant ; but they them selves had acquired much they could have got in no other country. For six years had converted Victoria into the most democratic country that the world till then had seen. Many thoughtful people were oppressed with foreboding fears, which were, in truth, not without some justification from experience. But in Victoria there was, as we now can discover, no real danger in surrendering the political power into the keeping of the whole body of the people. The great safeguard was the unexampled prosperity of the masses. It might be unsafe to place power in the hands of a starving populace. Where wretchedness exists, law and order are best preserved, perhaps, by leaving the lower classes to wrestle with their miseries, while a powerful army watches over them, and crushes out each spark that might spread to a revolution. As no legislation can make poverty-stricken millions well-to-do and comfortable, that is possibly the only way to deal with them. But where each man is prosperous, the people will be happiest and safest when they manage their own affairs, and spend their own money exactly in the way that pleases them best, even if it docs not exactly accord with what political experts can clearly demonstrate to be the wisest and most profitable way. And truly the material progress of Victoria in those golden days was surprising. Melbourne, which for a time had relapsed, as Latrobe declared, back to the period of weatherboard and corrugated iron, from which horror he had thought it completely emerged in 1850, now began to assume an air of dignity. Imposing buildings began to appear ; brick or solid bluestone became frequent, and two or three storied structures began to replace the squat-looking places of one story that had sprung up in the mushroom growth of 1852. Half a million of money had been spent in 1854 in converting the streets of the city into well-made roads with side paths. A town-hall of bluestone was now completed on that allotment so long vacant at the foot of the hill in Collins-street. A new post-office had been built round and over the old wooden place; but even that had proved insufficient, and in 1857 a commencement had been made with the present fine structure. A quarter of a million had been spent on the new Houses of Parliament ; for the first three years the Legislature had met in the St. Patrick's Hall ; it was now most handsomely housed. The Government had advanced two hundred thousand pounds to commence the construction of a system of waterworks for Melbourne, and the great Van Yean undertaking had been completed. The citizens, who in 1854 regularly paid five to ten shillings a load for Yarra water, including drainage, now had an abundant supply from the mountain streams of the Plenty Ranges brought into their homes. The first great local bank, the Bank of Victoria, had been established in 1853, and had rapidly taken a leading place in the finances of the colony. It was followed in 1855 by the Colonial Vol. I. 2 x"], [406, "384 VICTORIA AND LTS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. Bank, while in the meantime branches of the Bank of New South Wales, of the London Chartered, of the English, Scottish, and Australian, and of the Oriental, had been placed in a flourishing condition. A beginning was made in constructing the telegraphs and railways of the colony. In 1853 Latrobe asked the Colonial Office to send out a competent telegraph engineer, and at the end of that year Samuel W. M'Gowan landed. He was directed to form a line connecting Melbourne with Williamstown. It was soon finished, and the row of 330 red-gum posts carrying a single wire eleven miles long from the post-office to the lighthouse at Point Gellibrand, was the humble precursor of the ten thousand miles and more that we possess in the present day. The construction of lines went forward rapidly, and a bill was passed in Parlia ment to regulate their management, providing that they should form a Government department. But Latrobe was not an ardent supporter of Government interference in such matters. On his estimates for 1853 he placed the sum of \u00a330,000 to be spent in making a railway from Melbourne to Hobson's Bay, but he announced that if any private company chose to undertake the task, the Government would withdraw from the enterprise. The work must soon be carried out. The cost of cartage or even of lighterage from the bay to the city was most exorbitant, and formed a scandal to the community. A private company came forward; in less than a year the line was built, and on the 12th of September, 1854, the first locomotive of the colony, gaily decked with ribbons, snorted out from the temporary platform of the Melbourne station, and the days were over in which an immigrant had to pay two pounds to have his luggage drawn through the mud of the Sandridge road. About the same date the Melbourne Gas Company commenced its works; they were completed towards the close of 1855, and it was at the ceremony of this formal opening that Sir Charles Hotham received that fatal chill which gave the finishing blow to his enfeebled frame. The City Council could not agree as to the price to be paid for gas for public lamps, and so for some considerable time the streets continued to be dimly lit with oil. But the shops now made the evenings gay in Bourke street; they began to make a notable display behind great sheets of plate-glass, and to light them up with a glamour at night very different from their aspect when ill-dressed windows behind narrow little window-panes lay in a gloom scarce broken by the candles or the dingy lamp. The disorder, the fever, the extravagance of the golden era had passed away. The streets of Melbourne no longer gave any indication of the gold-digger, who had now permanently located himself on the goldfields, and if he came to town, came probably in his best clothes and discarded equally the garb and the manners of those lucky diggers who had taken possession of the streets in 1852. Melbourne was now the foremost city of Australasia, with 150,000 inhabitants. Geelong, too, had gathered dignity during the era of gold, and was in 1S54 a larger city than Melbourne had been three years before. It was the nearest port to Ballarat and the circumjacent goldfields. Its piers were crowded with ships ; its streets busy with drays piled high with freight, that nodded cumbrously behind long lines of bullocks bound for the diggings. These streets were clean and well paved, the Government having advanced a loan of two hundred thousand pounds to place them in good order. The buildings, though still to some extent a jumble of brick and wood and iron, were attractive enough, and there was beginning to be perceptible a growing inclination to use the fine freestone of the district, so that a cheerful, and even handsome aspect was noted by the visitor in some of the business portions. Geelong had been incorporated in October 1849, when Dr. Thomson became its first mayor. It was even then a"], [407, "THE ERA OF DEMOCRACY\u2014 1834 TO 1860. 385 promising place of business, but now it was the third city in Australasia, ranking next to Melbourne and Sydney, and a little ahead of Adelaide. But it made no great strides after 1856, and fell behind in the race, for after that date there was in full progress a railway to connect it with Melbourne. This was completed in 1856, and in 1857 it began to make a great difference in the trade of Geelong. So long as goods could be transmitted to Ballarat from Geelong and ten or fifteen pounds were saved, which the cartage from Melbourne to Geelong would have cost, ship captains had to endure the disadvantages of the bar in Corio Bay in order to save that freightage to the owners of cargo. But when a railway reduced the cost to reason able terms, the shipping began to congregate almost entirely at Hobson's Bay, and goods were forwarded by rail from Melbourne as the centre of all traffic. Yet even then, whilst Geelong was the terminus, it had the advantage of some commercial activity in the supply of the goldfields, for it had to provide for the reloading of great quantities of goods upon bullock drays and their transport to the diggings ; but even that activity was struck at when in June 1858 contracts were let for the construction of two great trunk lines, one from Melbourne to Castlemaine and Sandhurst, the other from Geelong to Ballarat. This latter line was opened on the nth of April 1 ,862, and goods then began to be carried through Geelong by rail, leaving to that city only the traffic of the Western District, from Corio Bay out to Colac and the Hopkins River. It was in connection with these railways that the Government of Victoria instituted its first public loan. An Act was passed in 1857 authorising a loan of eight millions, at the rate of six per cent, per annum. The railways were to cost six millions; but this loan provided for the Yan Yean expenditure, which in the end amounted to a million ; and also it included the sum of seven hundred thousand pounds advanced to the Corporations of Melbourne and Geelong for the proper making of their streets. To some there seemed an anomaly in this borrowing of money on the part of a community that was even then experiencing an unexampled prosperity. But Latrobe, who initiated the idea, was quite right not to seek to thrust on that one period, or on a very few years, a burden that would be heavy for it to bear, only in order that succeeding generations might enjoy the fruits without payment. There was, however, no question as to the general prosperity of the people. Their numbers had increased seven-fold in the ten years ending with 1860. But their exports had been multiplied by thirteen and their imports by twenty. Their postal business had increased more than twenty-fold ; and the amount of land they bought in these ten years was just ten times as much as all that had been bought in the preceding fourteen years. And this public progress was founded on a private prosperity that was most apparent. While wages exhibited only a partial decline from those that ruled in 1852 ; while salaries had shown no tendency to diminish; while the returns made by businesses and commercial enterprises grew handsomer rather than otherwise, the cost of living had declined to a remarkabel extent. In fact, while incomes were still trebled or at least doubled, the necessaries of life had all returned to their former prices ; and in those halcyon years, from 1S56 to 1862, everyone who was moderately industrious, and everyone who was moderately careful, could scarcely avoid the gathering of a little capital ; and as these qualities of industry and care were both marked features in the colony, the foundation was laid for that accumulation of capital which has been the cause of so much prosperity in later days. It was this general prosperity \u2014 by no means universal of course while thousands of diggers were unlucky, and thousands of others inclined to waste their money on drink, \u2014 it was this"], [408, "ON THE UPPER YARRA. 336 VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. prevailing tendency and capacity to lay by a little cash and acquire a little property, that rendered Victoria so secure amid all its democratic changes. The working classes, it is true, did not always exhibit an unqualified sense of fairness in the use of the power they had gained. They were a little too much inclined to regard the colony as made for them, and to forget that other interests beside their own existed in it. But that is no more than saying that they did not possess that refined and gentlemanly feeling, that considerate courtesy, which never yet in any community has been shown by any class, however exclusive and educated, when it obtained political power. Mistakes have been made ; sailings have appeared ; but none of those gigantic evils have occurred which were foretold by many visitors and by English reviews and newspapers which seared the dominance of the masses. On the contrary, Victoria has, in the main, reaped only blessings from its era of democracy."], [409, "DEPARTURE OF THE BURKE AND WILLS EXPEDITION FROM ROYAL PARK, 20TH AUGUST, l86o.

It was HWW fortunate that the golden era found a Governor in power whose aims and (yAfy^-fpy) aspirations were literary and scholastic; and all that Latrobe did in this respect T-TvSL//, found grateful recognition among the community. In 1S53 he placed no less a c.fe sum than \u00a3140,000 upon the estimates for the promotion of primary education, an amount which, in proportion to the population, left utterly in the rear any national expenditure elsewhere attempted up to that date; and out of the incongruous and unsettled elements of that excited period, there emerged a system of schools, defective in many ways, but promising well for the future. The foundation of the Melbourne University and of the Melbourne Public Library, two of the noblest institutions of the colony, sprang from the zeal for education that then actuated the community. But behind every public sentiment that assumes activity, there must be a man to give it shape. In Victoria that man was Redmond Barry. The judge was himself a scholar, and with scholarly ways; a lover, a pedantic lover, perhaps, of Horace and Homer; but no narrow eulogizer of only such literatures as are dead and decayed. He had a pulse that"], [410, "VICTORIA AND LTS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 388 beat in unison with the times, a wide delight in all that was best in art and literature. His sympathy with the people was strong, and he could judge of the studies that would be the best to occupy them, apart from his own standard of tastes. In those unquiet times when Melbourne swarmed with restless people, who had lost their natural anchorage; when crowds of workmen filled the city, who had no friends, and no home influence ; who were too apt to spend their evenings in the nearest public-house, a place to which perhaps their natural inclinations did not otherwise lead them, but only the need of something to do, and the desire for a brighter atmosphere than the overcrowded bedrooms of acted as librarian, and the young mechanic who chose to spend his evening there, or \u2014 if the room overflowed \u2014 in the adjoining kitchen, was wel come so to do. The worthy judge bought up books for the purpose, and liked to go out and meet the readers, who recognised his un affected kindness even if they sometimes had to listen to a ponderous, though impro vised, lecture on some sub ject they did not yearn to master. a boarding-house afforded ; in those times, Redmond Barry, in true kindness of spirit, opened a little lending library in his back kitchen. A spare room behind his house in Bourke-street, near the Jewish synagogue, was fitted up as a little reading room, and on the shelves stood the Cornhill Magazine,and Cham bers's Journal, and Blaekzvood, and so forth, in long ranges of volumes \u2014 wholesome reading and not too heavy for the purpose. His servant SIR REDMOND BARRY. Out of this humble beginning rose the Melbourne Public Library. It owed its inception to the influence of Barry during the short time when he was Solicitor-General, and held a position in the Cabinet. Latrobe placed ten thousand pounds on the estimates for 1853, and in July of that year a body of trustees was appointed \u2014 Barry and Stawell, Dr. Palmer, then Speaker of the Council, Childers, and D. C. Macarthur, of the Bank of Australasia. Two acres of land stretching from Swanston-street to Russell-street were granted for the purpose, and a commencement was made. Mr. Reed, the architect, drew the plans for a magnificent pile of buildings, to cover almost all the two acres, with four handsome fronts and a grand cupola rising high from the centre. A million and more of money would be required to complete the plan; ten thousand was granted, and next year ten thousand more; but it was only a small corner that could be built with these sums. It was, however, characteristic of the colony in those days not to raise small places for immediate needs, that would have to be destroyed as progress went on, but rather to draw out an extensive scheme, complete a small portion, and leave the rest to be added piece by piece, but all on some grand and harmonious design. Provision was also made for the formation of a University. It is said that the first suggestion came from Mr. Childers, but certainly Barry was the actual originator. What was merely a passing suggestion with Childers became a practical work with Barn', and one to which he devoted himself with ardour for all the remaining twenty-six years of his life. Latrobe also was most friendly to the idea, and would have lent it substantial assistance, but he left the colony immediately after its first inception. However, he placed the sum of thirty thousand pounds on his estimates for 1S53, in order to proceed with the building. At the close of 1852,"], [411, "BURKE AND WILLS.\u2014 1860. 389 Childers introduced into the Legislative Council the Act of Incorporation, in which the sum of nine thousand pounds was set apart as an annual endowment. This Act provided that the University should have power to confer the degrees of Bachelor and Master, in Arts, Medicine, Laws, and Music. It received the Governor's assent on 22nd January 1853. A site of a hundred acres to the north of the city was reserved for the purpose. Designs were called for; those of an architect named White were chosen, but in times so expensive, thirty thousand pounds provided for no great amount of building. Latrobe left the colony before the foundation stone of either of these institutions was laid, and one of the earliest public duties of Sir Charles Hotham was to perform that ceremony. On the 3rd of July 1854, when he had been but eleven days in the colony, he proceeded with a long train of carriages to the reserve in Carlton. He was met by Redmond Barry, a stately figure in his chancellor's gown, rich with gold-braiding, his knee-breeches clasped with gold and completed with white silk stockings. To Sir Charles and Lady Hotham, the courtly judge read an address well rounded in its periods and not wanting in quotations from the ancients. The stone was laid; then shaking each other's hands, with congratulatory words, the bystanders prophesied the time when the seat of learning there to rise would have a world-wide reputation. Then the procession moved back towards town, and stopped at the top of Swanston street, where the vice-regal party alighted and was received by Dr. Palmer, who had been appointed chairman of the trustees of the new Public Library. More addresses followed, and another stone was laid, when the Governor and his suite accepted Barry's invitation to a repast at his house in Spring-street. So the festivities were over. The work was now to begin, and Barry was the life of it. Plans were reviewed; reports of kindred institutions diligently gathered; a curriculum carefully devised for the University ; a most elaborate investigation entered into as to the most efficient list of books that could be obtained for the library with the six thousand pounds allowed by the Legislature for that purpose. The Library, consisting of the central portion of the west front, with its two ends boarded up, was ready in February 1856, and opened by General Macarthur ; but additional grants were made, and a wing was added and opened on the Queen's Birthday of 1859 by Sir Henry Barkly. By that time Barry's zeal and laborious exertions had been acknowledged by his appointment as president He was able to inform the Governor that there were thirteen thousand volumes on the shelves. Barry was an enthusiastic admirer of art. He began at an early date to agitate for the addition of a National Gallery in connection with the Library. In 1858 he had the satisfaction of seeing a small collection of pictures and some casts of famous statues, gathered as the -nucleus of a gallery. A building was not provided till afterwards. It was only in 1861 that Sir Henry Barkly formally opened the institution that has grown to be an object of pride to the colony. Barry's sympathies, though he himself traced his descent to the Conqueror, and was punctilious about his coat of arms, were thoroughly with the people. He used his influence to make the Library and the Gallery fully and freely accessible. Every decently-conducted person was admitted to the Library, and could take down such books as he wanted. He could, in fact, use the place and its books as if they were his own, untrammelled by any of those vexatious regulations that till then prevailed in all great libraries. The University also was planned on a popular basis. The Act of Incorporation declared it \"open to all classes and denominations of Her Majesty's subjects.\" The fees were fixed at a low rate, and it was a matter of extreme personal satisfaction to Barry in subsequent years to hear of academic distinction being won by"], [412, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 390 the sons of workmen. While the buildings were nearing completion, arrangements were being made for the choice of professors. There were to be four, and as everything would depend on their reputation and attainments, Barry devoted the most extreme care to the matter. Salaries of a thousand a year were offered, together with houses and allowances. A board was appointed in London to make the choice. It consisted of two distinguished astronomers, Sir John Herschel and Sir George Airy, together with Robert Lowe, Professor Maiden, and Sir William aBeckett, lately the Chief Justice of the colony, who had gone to England after his retirement. In 1855 there came the distinguished four, \u2014 young men, but all of mark. The Chair of Classics was filled by Professor Rowe, that of Mathematics by Professor W. P. Wilson, that of History and Political Economy by Professor W. E. Hearn, and that of Natural Science by Professor Frederick M'Coy. Unfortunately, Professor Rowe died immediately after commencing his duties, but in his place a scholar was obtained who was destined to do good service to the colony \u2014 Professor M. H. Irving, son of the famous preacher, Edward Irving. So the University was ready to start, and in 1856 it commeneed work with seven students. Another care of those early days was the foundation of good secondary schools. In 1853 the Council voted \u00a320,000 to assist the religious denominations in building institutions of that class, which they were afterwards to manage and maintain by their own means. In 1856 the Church of England Grammar School was founded on the St. Kilda-road. The sum of \u00a316,000 was spent upon its picturesque buildings, and in 1858 when it was complete Dr. Bromby arrived to be its first head-master. The Presbyterians founded in East Melbourne their school, which they called the Scotch College; they received about \u00a34000 as a contribution to its building fund; its first principal was a Mr. Miller, but the institution owed its reputation to Alexander Morrison, who has conducted it from its infancy until now. Near it rose St. Patrick's College for the Roman Catholic body, while at a later date the Wesleyans built their Wesley College on the St. Kilda-road. Geelong also built two fine schools \u2014 a grammar school and a college. Following in the wake of this general enthusiasm for education came the desire to form scientific societies. Up till the year 1852 no such institution had been thought of; but at that date, when the chief interests of the community were gold, and gold-bearing rocks, and strata likely to be auriferous, an attempt was made to found a Geological Society ; but everybody was too much engrossed at that time, October 1852, in active search, to think of scientific research, and the project fell through. In that year however, the Government obtained the services of Dr. Ferdinand Mueller as botanist, and with his advent came science in its abstract form. We had also in the colony for a year or two the eminent botanist, William Swainson, P\\R.S., and these, with S. W. M'Gowan, the Telegraph Engineer, and Selwyn, the Government Geologist, Professor M'Coy, Mr. Ligar, the Surveyor-General, Professor Neumayer, and others formed a body of scientific enthusiasm which in 1855 succeeded in establishing the Philosophical Institute. This bod)- became, in 1860, the Royal Society, \u2014 an institution which in those days was hailed with delight by all classes, the Governor, Sir Henry Barkly, in especial taking a great interest and becoming an actively working member. A general enthusiasm for scientific objects was a prevailing feature; when suddenly a comparatively small circumstance turned all this vague, though powerful feeling, in a determinate direction. A merchant of Melbourne, Ambrose Kbyte, in the year 1858, had placed in the hands of Sir William Stawell the sum of one thousand pounds, to be expended in fitting out an exploring expedition, on condition that the public subscribed another two thousand within a year. Sir William laid the matter before the Royal Society, which agreed to gather subscriptions. For the first eleven months there had been a general apathy, but"], [413, "BURKE AND WILLS.\u2014 1860 39i in 1859 a tide of enthusiasm began to flow, and money began to come in. Over three thousand pounds were subscribed. O'Shanassy was then Premier. To one of his disposition, the idea was pleasant that Victoria should equip the first expedition to cross Australia. He placed six thousand pounds upon the estimates, and, entering thoroughly into the scheme, despatched George James Landells to India to procure a number of camels, which, as it was thought, would be most likely to cross the arid deserts then supposed to constitute the whole of interior Australia. This occupied time, and it was not till the year 1860 that the preliminary arrange ments were completed, and the exploration committee of the Royal Society was ready to undertake the choice of officers. Advertisements were published calling for applications ; nearly seven hundred responses were received ; but it was exceedingly difficult to select a suitable leader. There was much newspaper discussion, much agitation of different names, but the choice fell at last upon Robert O'Hara Burke, police inspector of the Castlemaine district. No man more bold, more self-sacrificing, more free from mercenary motive could have been chosen ; but he was not gifted with sufficient tact or suffi cient capacity for command, to be entrusted with the care of an expedition where in discipline was absolutely essential for safety, yet where in the various members would refuse to yield a policeman like obedience, and would yield a cheerful deference only to superior skill and to weight of character. He was of an ancient Galway family, had been trained at Woolwich, had fought in the Austrian army, had served in the Irish constabulary, emi grated to Victoria during the gold fever,' had joined the mounted police, had become inspector first in Beech worth, then in Castlemaine, and now at forty years of age his restless life of adventure brought him to the position ot leader in a large and somewhat cumbrously appointed expedition. ROBERT O'HARA BURKE. The people of Victoria, in this their first national undertaking, were filled with zeal to do it well. In charge of the twenty-five camels went Landells, who arrogated to himself much importance from the fact that he alone in all Australia, as he thought, knew how to manage these animals. Three sepoys from India assisted him in this work. The third position was given to a young astronomer, the warm-hearted, single-minded, generous, devoted, William John Wills, who, for two years, had been assistant to Professor Neumayer in the Magnetic Observatory at Williamstown. Ludwig Becker went as artist and naturalist, a man of high attainments; Hermann Beckler as physician and botanist; Charles Ferguson as foreman, with William Brahe, John King. and seven other European assistants. At length, in August, all preparations were complete, and Monday the 20th was appointed as the day for starting. The camels had been housed in temporary stables in the Royal Park, and that was made the starting point. Thither on the appointed morning the people ol Melbourne, making a holiday in honour of the occasion, came trooping by thousands, for the expedition was one that was wonderfully dear to the popular heart. The day was almosl spent in finally loading and adjusting the drays, and duly fitting the packs upon the camels backs; but at half-past four in the afternoon the long procession was formed, the crowc Vol. 1. - Y"], [414, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLLS: PAST AND PRESENT. 392 opened out in a line; Burke on his grey pony took the lead, his pack-horses following, then seven and twenty camels; then six waggons, heavily laden, the total luggage of the party exceeding twenty-one tons. Moving out to the main gate, Burke there halted, his train stretching away back, nearly to the centre of the park. He had to wait while the exploration committee wished the party \" God speed.\" The mayor, Dr. Eades, mounted on a dray and made a neat little speech, ending with a call for three cheers, to which the vast crowd responded in ringing fashion. Burke, with uncovered head, replied in manly words, with the hope and trust to do something to justify all the popular enthusiasm and confidence. Then he moved forward, and the crowd saw the procession defile out upon the Flemington-road, where the first halt was called beyond Essendon. A fortnight of easy journeying through a green and pleasant country took them to the Murray River, but not without incident. The foreman, Ferguson, partly out of a bumptious self-importance, and partly out of an undue resentment of Burke's somewhat hasty words and manner, made himself offensive, and showed signs of insubordination. A week later, when at Balranald, Burke dismissed him. This act greatly irritated Landells, who regarded himself as having sole charge of the camels and the men connected with them. Another cause of quarrel arose in regard to the rum which Landells insisted on carrying for the camels to drink, and which Burke had good reasons for wishing to leave behind. Landells resigned and returned to Victoria ; so did Dr. Beckler, and thus the party lost three of its number. Wills was then formally made second in command ; but as Becker, the next in rank, was old and of delicate health, and busy with his artistic and geologic pursuits, the third position required the appointment of a new man, and Burke unluckily chose for it a man named Wright, a bushman, who was then on a station at Menindie, on the Darling, to which place the expedition had come about the middle of October. This was a grievous mistake. Wright was plausible, and his talk was of the most liberal promise. The Irish generosity of Burke's impulsive nature was warmed in his favour, and led him to entrust a position of some responsibility to a man who appears to have had every honesty of intention but little capacity and less energy. This error would not have been of serious consequence if Burke had not taken the rash resolve of dividing his company into two portions. He seems to have grown weary of the ponderous movements of a party of eighteen persons, with all that merchandise and all these animals. It had been decided by the exploration committee that Cooper's Creek, already well explored by Captain Sturt, should form the basis of operations. A camp was to be formed there, and at that point Burke was to decide for himself in what direction it seemed most profitable for him to proceed. But already supplies of meat were running short, and Burke resolved to leave Wright behind at Menindie to obtain some jerked beef; and to wait till replies could be returned from Melbourne to his despatches telling of the resignation of Landells and Beckler, and his consequent appointments. However, as Wright knew the country between the Darling and Cooper's Creek, he went with them for the first two hundred miles to act as guide. His practical knowledge led the party each evening to a suitable camping-place beside abundance of water, and as the country was green and pleasant, their journey of twenty miles a-day was only an enjoyment. On the tenth day they reached a small swamp called Torowoto. There Wright and two of the Hindoos turned back, with instructions from Burke to bring up the rest of the part)-, and all the remaining stores, to the camp at Cooper's Creek. No doubt Burke wished to save time, and by pushing on ahead to make a preliminary survey"], [415, "BURKE AND WILLS.\u2014 1860 393 of the country beyond Cooper's Creek in order that a vigorous start might be made when the whole party was properly established at the creek. Wright, however, seems to have been a purposeless creature. He sent a man back from Menindie to Melbourne to ask two hundred pounds for the purpose of buying sheep, which he proposed to drive to the camp. A trooper named Hodgkinson rode the four hundred miles in eleven days, and promptly received from the treasurer, Dr. Wilkie, double the sum demanded. This was on the last day of 1860, and in ten days Hodgkinson was back at Menindie. That was smart work, but it was rendered useless by Wright's foolish slowness. More than a fortnight elapsed before he moved out of Menindie, and then it was at a very sluggish pace. Meanwhile Burke had moved on rapidly from Torowoto with Wills, and a party of six men \u2014 Brahe, King, Gray, Patten, M'Donough, and Dost Mahomet \u2014 with fourteen horses and sixteen camels. Twenty miles a-day brought them in thirteen days to Cooper's Creek. This was about the time when Wright got back to Menindie. Burke gave him a month more to complete his arrangements and come up to Cooper's Creek. That period was spent by Burke and Wills in zealous work. The camels and horses were mostly allowed to rest ; but, with two or three at a time, the leaders moved out into the country beyond, to find a practicable route. The weather was growing intensely hot, and the surface water was disappearing. The first anxiety was to find a pool or creek in front to make a dash for. The bulk of this work was done by Wills, whose activity was untiring ; Burke be came unwell, and unable to help to any great extent. Wills in one trip pene trated ninety miles to the north, with a companion and three camels. No water was found, and while Wills was taking an observation, the man let the camels stray. They were never re covered. The two men had then to abandon all the pro visions and implements they had brought, and walk back all the ninety miles, carrying their own provisions and all the water they had. In a second expedition Wills took two camels and recovered the baggage that had been abandoned. But no very profitable result came of a good deal of hard work, Wills himself travelling fully four hundred miles in various directions, without much advancing the problem of their future course. WILLIAM JOHN WILLS. They were now in the middle of December, the weather growing hotter, the creek shrinking into a mere series of clay-stained waterholes, though still looking fresh with its overhanging lines of gum trees and evergreens. All around, as far as the eye could see, the country looked dry, the patches of kangaroo grasses were withering up, the thin herbage on the soil was parched and brown, the chrysanthemums and mallows were drooping, the salt-bushes and box trees here and there scarcely broke the greyness of the general aspect by their grey green foliage. Every week it was growing drier, and an early move was very desirable; yet after a month of waiting there was no sign of Wright ; and, as a matter of fact, if they had waited yet another month they would have seen as little of him. Burke grew impatient. To be in the middle of the continent and wait there more than a month seemed to him intolerable. He would wait no longer. Four months were gone ; they had come seven hundred miles, but all"], [416, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 394 that distance was well known. Seven hundred miles more lay before them to the north, between Cooper's Creek and the Gulf of Carpentaria. That was the region to be traversed and first made known. He would leave behind him the bulk of the impedimenta, and with a lightly-equipped party would make a dash across the intervening space and be back within three months. He chose as his associates Wills, King, and Gray ; he took one horse and six camels. Of the four left in charge at Cooper's Creek he chose William Brahe as leader, a German of some education, and thoroughly trustworthy. Brahe was to take charge of all the stores, six camels, and twelve horses, till Wright, on arriving, should supersede him in the command. Before Burke started there was some talk as to how long he proposed to be away. He thought four months was the limit. He would not be more than that length of time ; indeed, his provisions were not calculated to last more than three months. In the early morning of the 16th December the party of four started on their memorable but fatal exploit. For two days they followed the course of Cooper's Creek, being a good deal pestered by the natives. They then turned due north, a course they followed thereafter for weeks consecutively. The country was by no means so badly grassed as they had expected, and the camels had abundance of salt-bush. Box and gum-tree were common enough, and in the hollows green plats of mesembryanthemum and fresh-looking herbs made many parts of the route seem pretty. Abundance of birds \u2014 cockatoos, pigeons, and wild duck \u2014 showed that the place was anything but a desert. The course they were following was fortunately well supplied with good water at comfortable stages, and after a fortnight's pleasant journey they spent their Christmas in a delightful little spot on the banks of what they called Gray's Creek. A day or two later they reached a finer stream, which they followed north for a few days, till they found it trending too far east. Thus they reached the end of the year. So far their track had lain over a plain with streams, not flowing, yet full of water. Now they saw ahead of them barren stony ridges which experience told them would be dry. They loaded their camels with a ten days' supply of water, but by avoiding the ranges they found the country not wholly devoid of pools. On the 7th of January 1861 they were on the tropic of Capricorn, three hundred miles away, and all was well. Still onward, over undulating country with abundant vegetation, and green with portulaca and vetches ; water still abundant. Every day they crossed several creeks. Even when they reached a region of low ranges of sandstone hills, with hollows of loose sand between, they found abundance of grass and a stream of water every few miles. On the 26th January they reached a fine stream, which Burke called after his old friend, Lord Cloncurry. This was in reality a tributary of the Flinders River, and it poured its waters northward into the Gulf of Carpentaria, though as yet the explorers knew nothing of that. With joy they found its waters running deep and cool, between high steep banks in a course almost due north. Palm trees were abundant, and gigantic ant-hills were seen, showing that they were entering the torrid zone ; and, indeed, they were only a hundred and fifty miles from the Gulf of Carpentaria. Strange to say, it was only on this very day that Wright moved out of his position at Menindie, and started for Cooper's Creek. Mismanagement characterised all he did. He bungled about the road ; he quarrelled with the natives, and fired on them, exciting their hostility and revenge. To add to his troubles, scurvy broke out. Becker, Patten, Stone and Purcell all died, and he fell back again on Menindie, a victim rather of incompetency than of misfortune. Brahe, meantime, had built a stockade at Cooper's Creek for the defence of his"], [417, "BURKE AND WILLS\u2014 1860. 395 party of four if attacked by blacks. He was waiting with great anxiety for the arrival of Wright, all unconscious that Wright had turned back to Menindie. But long before that time Burke had completed his gallant but imprudent dash across the continent. His troubles, however, only began just as triumph was crowning the exploit. Golah, one of his finest camels, got down into the bed of the Cloncurry, but the banks were so steep and unbroken that no exertions could get him out again. They left him for the time being, as they were so near the sea, and pushed on. But as they approached the mouth of the river (the Flinders) they found the ground become boggy, and the camels floundered along with difficulty. Burke therefore resolved to push on with Wills, taking the horse and three days' provisions, and leaving King and Gray with the camels. There was some little danger in this arrangement, for the blacks were numerous and of mischievous aspect, never approaching near enough for parley, but often seen skulking behind trees among the marshes. On the 3rd of February, 1861, Burke and Wills started, but they had not gone far when their horse sank in a quicksand in crossing a branch of the river. He was with great difficulty extricated, but soon after, again floundered down through the rotten soil. The horse became very weak with repeated experiences of that sort. With only his saddle and twenty-five pounds weight on his back, he found some difficulty in moving along. It was clear, moreover, by the saltness of the water that they were close to the estuary of the river. They were therefore practically at the Gulf of Carpentaria, and could feel the satisfaction of having been the first to traverse the entire width of Australia. But their last week or two had been a time of hard work, with scarcely adequate food ; they were nearly two months away from their depot, and they had only one month's supply of provisions. No time must now be wasted ; they must leave their horse Billy in hobbles, and reach the water's edge without him. Struggling onward, they got him about three miles further, till he was absolutely tired out. Then they camped for the night in the midst of the mangrove jungle. At daybreak they started, leaving the weary horse to revel in the long grass. How they fared we do not now know, for no journals of that part of the trip were ever recovered, and death set the seal of silence upon the lips of the only two men who were there. We may imagine them, however, trudging over the thin crust of sun-baked clay that made the precarious footing in that mangrove swamp. Geese, plover, pelican, dived and spluttered in all the quiet pools that spread their brackish waters here and there ; an occasional little pebbly rise afforded a glimpse of the widespread forest ; but it was probably long in that level country before they at last caught a sight of the summer-dreaming waters of the gulf,\u2014 a shining line to the north. It was enough, and they turned back. It was not till after a couple of days that they recovered their horse Billy, and followed the tracks that would lead them to the place where King and Gray were waiting with the camels. About three days brought them back, and the party of four were again united. They had still five of their camels, and their horse, but all in poor condition ; and they themselves had less than one month's provisions for a two months' journey. No rest could be permitted, and on the 13th of February they all started on the homeward path. For a fortnight there was nothing eventful, though the sleeping out under frequent tropical rains without tent or covering was far from conducive to health. On the seventeenth da)' they recovered Golah, the lost camel in the bed of the Cloncurry. He was thin and miserable, and seemed to have fretted at his lonely position. This time they got him out, and the party, with all their animals recovered, hurried on to make a bold push for safety. Next day Gray killed"], [418, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 396 an enormous snake of a non-venomous species. Unluckily, in their prospect of rapidly failing provisions, they took the resolve of eating the snake, and that unaccustomed food, together with a month of travelling in a miasmatic district, and of sleeping on the ground with malaria all around, caused Burke to be attacked by dysentery. But he had to hurry on. They found an edible fruit on the palm-trees, which they ate with relish. Burke improved a little in health, but Gray began to show signs of illness. The camel Golah then utterly collapsed, and could scarcely hobble along. The party had to abandon him, the first of a long process that was before them. On they went for a week, averaging their twenty miles a day in monotonous fashion. On the 13th of March the rains descended in torrents, and the creeks rose so that they had to take shelter in a sort of cave among some fallen rocks, into which during the night the waters intruded, driving them up into the furthest recess. Swollen creeks and boggy ground delayed them most unfortunately during the next week, just when speed was becoming a matter of dire necessity. On the 20th of March they overhauled their packs, and left behind sixty CHARLES GRAY. pounds weight of things they could best spare. They could not but notice that the land they were traversing was of excellent character and had all the appearance of a fine pastoral district ; but the succession of heavy thunderstorms that burst and kept the creeks full made it difficult country for them under their circumstances. All were now on short rations, and hard work, a trying climate, and reduced fare, were telling on their bodies to a perceptible extent. On the 24th of March, Wills accidentally stumbled on Gray, who was sitting behind a tree, eating some flour and water in secret. He had abstracted the flour without permission, and Burke, indignant at what seemed treachery, gave the unfortunate fellow what Wills in his journal called \"a good thrashing,\" though King subsequently described it as merely a few slaps with the open hand on the side of the head. Burke's impulsive nature was apt to lead him into actions that were undignified, and perhaps unjust ; but his warm heart made him regret his hasty temper, and he seems to have been kind to Gray in his subsequent illness. On the 29th of March, the camels had their last good feed before entering a poorer region of withered shrubs. One of them was here killed, and his flesh dried for use, as provisions were now practically exhausted. A week later, out on the arid plains, Gray gave in. He was unable to drag himself forward at the rate they were travelling ; but it was a matter of life and death to get onward. They pushed on ; Gray fell behind. They reluctantly waited. He crawled up and joined them. They then waited a day while Gray rested, and while they killed their horse Billy and dried his flesh also. The poor animal was so worn out that he could not keep pace, and his flesh was already required by the famished party. Still they kept up their spirits ; all but poor Gray. They were now within a hundred miles of safety ; another day or two would bring them to the western end of Cooper's Creek. Three days up the creek would bring them to the depot where Brahe and Wright would be waiting. \" Courage,\" each said to the other ; but Gray was not destined to reach the creek. On the 17th of March he started as usual, but his words when he spoke were indistinct, and he only staggered onward. During the day he lay down for the last time, and soon"], [419, "BURKE AND WILLS.\u2014 1860 397 died a peaceful death. His three companions halted a day to try to bury the wasted body. Their united strength scarcely permitted them to decently cover it. A crowd of natives now appeared who seemed anxious to make friends with the tottering white men ; but they were afraid to trust them, and kept them at a distance. So on they fared, all weak, but spending their remaining strength in one supreme effort to reach Brahe \u2014 and safety. Meantime the position of Brahe had been a most unenviable one. He had never been appointed to any responsible charge. He was merely told to wait for a week or so at Cooper's Creek ; by that time Wright would be there to relieve him. He was to give Wright instructions to wait for about three months, at the end of which time Burke's party would have returned. But on the one hand he had seen nothing of Wright, who as a matter of fact never reached Cooper's Creek at all ; on the other hand he had waited not only three, but even THE RETURN TO THE DESERTED DEPOT four months for Burke, yet saw no signs of him. Even after that he waited on from day to day, perplexed as to what he should do. Burke's party might all be dead, or they might have been picked up by some vessel at the Gulf of Carpentaria, or they might have found it more suitable to make their way to Queensland or to Western Australia. He waited a fortnight more. Then, when eighteen weeks were gone, he thought that further delay would be useless. He buried a box with about two hundred pounds of provisions beside a tree, on which he cut the word \" Dig.\" Along with the provisions he placed a note stating that he was starting next day with six camels and twelve horses, all in good condition. At ten o'clock next morning he left the camp, and made good progress southward towards the Bulloo. At sunset that same evening the worn-out wanderers, Burke, Wills, and King returned to the depot. They looked about in bewilderment ; where was the part)' ? They saw the word \" Dig,\" and then the truth"], [420, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 398 dawned upon them. Eagerly they uncovered the box, and brought forth the provisions. The note told them that Brahe had gone only that morning, but his horses and camels were fresh ; the two camels that they had with them could scarcely crawl along. It was useless to think of pursuit. They cooked some of the food and felt better. But they were excessively weary, footsore, and stiff in every limb. They reckoned, however, that they had abundance of provisions to take them eventually to safety. So they rested a couple of days, while deliberations as to their future course filled up the time round their camp fire. Wills wished to follow Brahe as rapidly as they could ; and had that course been adopted they must certainly all have been saved, for Brahe, when only a few days out, met the lazy Wright on his way up from Menindie, and turned back with him. In less than a week therefore, if they had held on after a short rest, the wanderers would have been recovered. But Burke was utterly wearied out. He was ill. The walk to Menindie was at least four hundred miles. Now, he had heard that in South Australia pastoral settlement had pushed far up towards Cooper's Creek, and that, in fact, there was a station at Mount Hopeless, only a hundred and fifty miles away. He took the unfortunate resolution of finding his way thither, over an unknown and unexplored country. Wills was modest, and did not assert his opinion. King obeyed orders. In the cache they buried all their papers, and a note stating that they had started for Adelaide. Here there occurred THE BURKE TREE. another most unlucky coincidence. Brahe, afraid that the blacks would be attracted by the look of the ground, had trampled down the earth where he had dug it up, and had stabled his camels over it for a day in order that intruders might not guess that provisions were concealed below. Burke took exactly the same precautions, and though he buried his note, he neither took down Brahe's notice to dig, nor did he add anything to it. He left the place precisely as he had found it. This want of reflection cost him his life. On the 23rd of April they started on their trip to Mount Hopeless. But they were so weak that not more than four or five miles a day could be contemplated. On the second day they received a supply of fish from the natives in return for some scraps of leather. Better fare and short stages made their strength somewhat revive, and for five days they held south-west without mishap. Then one of their camels sank in a soft part of the creek. They spent a day and a-half in the effort to get him out, but at last had to shoot him, and dry such of his flesh as they could get off his worn-out carcase, a day being spent in the process. Next morning, the 1st of May, they loaded up their only remaining camel, Rajah, with all their property, and each took a small bundle on his own shoulders. For two days further they followed Cooper's Creek, but now Rajah began to show signs of failing. He trembled violently, and his load was lightened, the explorers leaving the less necessary of their provisions behind them. But he managed to plod along in a fashion as lame and tottering as that of the men themselves. On the tenth day they found it impossible to proceed by the line of the creek. There had been heavy rains, and in that level country the branches and billabongs became innumerable ; some were deep and full of water, some were shallow, but with quicksand beds. A"], [421, "BURKE AND WILLS. -1860. 399 mile and a half was often a most toilsome distance to traverse. The eleventh day was spent by Wills in searching for a way out of the difficulty, while Burke and King stayed with the camel to rest. He was unsuccessful. They all turned back a day's march up the creek. Wills noted in his journal that they had little to cheer up their spirits. Their clothing was going to pieces, their boots already gone, and the rations were rapidly diminishing. He supposes it must end in their having to live like the blacks for a few months. Next day the camel was so ill that he refused to rise. King was left with him while Burke and Wills went out to reconnoitre. They found some blacks, who, in return for a piece of macintosh, gave them a considerable quantity of fish and some bread, which they called nardoo, made from the seeds of a kind of fern-like clover. Indeed, the two white men were fed by the kindly blacks till they could eat no more. Next day Burke returned to King ; Wills followed the creek, and, after exploring all day, returned to the blacks, who again entertained him hospitably. He had a good supper of fish, nardoo, and rats. He slept all night beside the camp fire, and next day returned to his comrades. The camel had been shot, and Burke and King were busy drying its flesh. It was now clear enough that they would not dare, under their present circumstances to leave the vicinity of the creek, where water at least was plentiful, and strike across the waterless deserts that lay between them and Mount Hopeless. The)- therefore practised the trapping of animals, chiefly birds and rats, and the gathering of nardoo seed. They were not at all successful, however, none of them ever having attempted anything in that way before. They spent a day or two in trying to find the blacks once more, but they had disappeared, and could not be traced. The prospect seemed as bad to remain as to push out into the desert. They therefore concealed everything they did not absolutely require. They had now no beast of burden ; everything they would have to eat or drink must be carried upon their own shoulders. Making up their bundles as neatly as they could, they started on the 17th May, and faced the perilous desert that lay outwards to the south. What were their exact movements it is now impossible to say, but they seem to have found the project clearly hopeless of crossing a hundred miles with only such food as the)' could carry themselves; and as they had noticed for the first time as they left the creek places where the nardoo seed was abundant, they were back at the waterside in a few days. They now found it easy to gather the seed, and it seemed to be nourishing. Wills left his comrades, and travelled back to the depot to see if anyone had arrived ; if not, to leave journals and records up to date. It was a most melancholy coincidence that Wright and Brahe had in truth been back some days previously, but finding their cache with all the appearance of having been undisturbed, Burke's care having been but too successful, the)' had waited only a quarter of an hour, and then, without examination, gone off again. Wills tottered on in a very sickly condition into the depot, but saw no signs of anyone having been there but the natives. A most miserable chain of unlucky incidents seemed conspiring to render the expedition fatal. Wills dug up the cache and deposited papers and a note, in case any one came back in the meantime. He then turned down the creek again, and in six days reached his comrades, finding natives all the way, who gave him more fish and nardoo than he could eat. Pie found Burke and King also singing the praises of the kindly blacks, who had been lavish in their gifts. They rested a day, but as the blacks had moved away, they resolved to keep close to them and place their camp each night not far from the native camp. But again there was the trouble that the Vol. I. 2 z"], [422, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 400 blacks were not to be found. For six days they searched without success, but on the other hand they began to be adepts in the collection and grinding of nardoo, which kept them alive ; but it had little nutriment in it by itself, as they now discovered, and they could not equal the natives in the capture of fish. They all grew weaker, and Wills records that he was barely able to go to the creek for water. It was winter now \u2014 the middle of June ; the chilly nights, with little clothing, became painful hours to be passed through as patiently as possible. On the 16th of June the)- finished the last of the camel's flesh. King shot a crow. They spent their day mostly in cleansing and pounding nardoo, but weakness was steadily increasing. Wills describes Burke and King as being very unsteady on their legs, and he himself was little better. On the 20th, the effects of cold and starvation began to be still more painfully mamfest ; but King seemed to be the best able to digest nardoo and to obtain its nourishment A week later Burke and King resolved to go off in search of the blacks, Wills being too ill to rise; they tottered off on what was regarded as their last chance, leaving their comrade stretched in their little shelter-place. He was poorly clad to endure the bitterly cold nights that followed the mild and sometimes warm daytime-a merino shirt and the tattered remnants of another, the sad remains of a pair of flannel trowsers, the debris of two pairs of socks an old waistcoat and a wide-awake hat.-so we can fancy the recumbent figure with the' patient intellectual face, grown gaunt and thin, and the affectionate eyes grown lustrous with a"], [423, "BURKE AND WILLS.\u2014 1860 401 significant lustre. There he lay, as he playfully enters in his diary, waiting like Mr. Micawber for \" something to turn up.\" He thinks he will perhaps last for four or five days yet, if the weather should be warm. His comrades were very loth to leave him, but it was a last effort for the safety of all. They left him eight days' supply of nardoo, but he needed much less than that. Water and firewood were placed within his reach, and off they started, Wills, as a last charge, entrusting them with his watch and a letter for his father. They staggered on, Burke keeping his feet with difficulty. On the second day he crawled two miles, and then gave up the effort. King found some nardoo for him, and shot a crow, which made a good supper. But as evening drew on Burke said he would not last many hours. He asked King to give him his pistol to hold in his right hand when death approached, and to remain with him till he was quite dead. And so the night closed in. King slept- for a time, but when day broke Burke's life was ending. He was speechless, and lay with glassy eyes still grasping the pistol. At eight o'clock he breathed his last. King hovered about the place for a sew hours, but as there was no use in waiting, he set forth on his lonely quest for the natives. Two days he wandered in terrible dreariness, sleeping at nights in deserted huts. On the third night he found in one of these a supply of nardoo sufficient to last him a fortnight, and that evening he shot another crow. After remaining there two days to recruit his strength, he returned to the place where Wills had been left, but only his pallid corpse lay there. King had left the body of Burke unburied, as that was the dying man's last wish, but he them, they began to show him more deference. A woman, to whom he gave a crow, handed him in return a ball of nardoo, intimating that she would have given more if her arm had not been too sore to pound it. King looked at the arm, sponged it with warm water, and touched it with a little caustic. From that time he was permitted to live with the natives as one of themselves, and until his relief, a month later, was treated by them with uniform kindness. covered the corpse of Wills with loose sand, and then went again in pursuit of the blacks. He shot a crow, and the natives, hearing the report, came to him and took him to their camp. They treated him well, but after four days grew tired of him, and signified that they were going up the creek, but that he had better go down. He pre tended not to understand, and carefully followed them. But on his shooting some crows for JOHN KIN Long before this time alarm had been felt in Melbourne. The first anxiety was in March, but there was then nothing to cause immediate concern. The flying part)- of four were not expected back at Cooper's Creek till the middle of that month, but in April it began to be urged that a relief party ought to be sent. In May came the news that Brahe had abandoned the depot at Cooper's Creek, and that there was then no news of the explorers. The exploration committee took the matter up, but there were many adverse opinions ; there were some who felt certain that Burke had penetrated into settled districts either to east or to west, and that the first they would hear of him would be from Brisbane or from Perth. In the middle of June, while Burke and Wills were passing the hours in contemplation of speedy death, though still with a faint gleam of hope that relief might come in time, the committee was getting ready for action."], [424, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 402 What Wright ought to have done from Menindie as a basis, they had now to do from Melbourne, four hundred miles further away. Fortunately, they had the offer of a most suitable leader. Alfred W. Howitt, who, with his father, Wm. Howitt, had visited the colony seven years before, was now settled in it. He was young, enthusiastic, of good scientific attainments, and he had learned to be an excellent bushman. He offered his services to go on a relief expedition. A light part)- was arranged for him, and he started towards the end of June. But it was then, if he had only known it, already too late to save either Burke or Wills, who were dead before the close of that month. When Howitt reached the Murray River he met Brahe on his way back. What he learned made him certain that so light a party as he had was of little use. The work promised to be long and arduous. He therefore turned back to Melbourne. A much larger expedition was provided, with abundance of provisions, so that Cooper's Creek might be held for a long time as a basis for extensive operations. And so he set out again for the north, accompanied by Brahe. Meantime, the Government offered assistance. It sent word to Queensland, asking the authorities there to equip a search expedition at Rockhampton, Victoria to pay the expenses subsequently, and it despatched Captain Norman in a Government steamer to examine the coast of the Gulf of Carpentaria for signs of the missing men. Captain Norman was also to land there an expedition under W. Landsborough to traverse the interior in search of the party. Queensland chose Frederick Walker, and contributed to the expense of his outfit. Walker and Norman both found the tracks of Burke and Wills; Landsborough was not successful in that respect, but, as he travelled far a-field up and down the Albert River district, he added greatly to the' geography of Australia. The South Australian Government, moved to a neighbourly enthusiasm, fitted out at their own expense a relies expedition under M'Kinlay, who, moving due north from Adelaide, just missed the tracks of Burke and Wills near Mount Hopeless, and then sweeping westward, crossed with ease to the Gulf of Carpentaria, going leisurely and driving a flock of sheep before him for the support of his party. When he reached the Gulf he turned eastward, crossed the tracks of Burke and Wills, and then turned south-east to Rockhampton, traversing a great extent of unexplored country, and adding much to our knowledge of the continent. Landsborough, Walker, and M'Kinlay all conducted their parties wisely, expeditiously and well, but it was Howitt who was successful. It was the middle of September when he reached Cooper's Creek. Pie spent some days following the camel tracks up and down. At length two of his men, who had been out scouring the country, returned to him with the report that they had seen King among the blacks. He accompanied them to the native encampment, where he found King seated in a hut the tribe had made for him. There he sat, wasted to a shadow, weak in body, a little incoherent in speech, known as a civilised man only by the shreds of clothing that still hung round him. The natives were overjoyed at the prospect of safety for their friend, who was carried off by the white men and carefully tended for three days, till he was able to guide them to the spot where the remains of the explorers were to be found. The bones of Wills were gathered from out the sand, and were interred not far away. King could go no further. He gave directions by which Howitt was enabled to find the hut wherein lay the bones of Burke, all in order, with the rusty pistol hard by. They were wrapped in a union jack and reverently buried. Two days later Howitt went out to recompense the friendly natives. Thirty or forty of them gathered. When the supplies of presents were brought forth\u2014 the knives, the beads, the looking-glasses, the combs, the sugar, and so forth\u2014"], [425, "BURKE AND WILLS\u2014 1860. 403 they were beside themselves with excitement, and bawled till the din was deafening. With the aid of King, they were induced to sit down in an orderly row, and each was duly supplied ; the conclusion being the presentation of a coloured pocket handkerchief to each, filled with sugar which at once disappeared. At the end of the year Howitt got back to Melbourne, where King was received with unbounded enthusiasm. The Victorian people, a newly-formed nation, \u00b0had attempted something national. A famous exploit had been achieved, and all were proud ; but seven men had lost their lives in it, and of those who had perished there were two who had been the leaders, and round whose names there had gathered quite a halo of heroism. The result of their trip had been great\u2014 not to be compared, perhaps, with those of Sturt and others, but they had earned the distinction of being the first to cross Australia from sea to sea. M'Douall Stuart was but a year or so later in crossing ; and M'Kinlay also, in his relief expedition, passed from Adelaide to the Gulf of Carpentaria. Still there is always a peculiar interest attaching to the first achievement of a difficult task, even though independent workers may be but a little way behind, and the public enthusiasm was stimulated by a strong sense of national life, and by the hope that Victoria might one day show a long record of noble deeds to cast a lustre round her name. The people crowded to the railway station. King was escorted to Government House like a hero, and a pension was bestowed upon him. But the people were not content unless the bones of the intrepid leaders should rest in Victorian soil. Howitt was provided with a party in order that he might return and bring back their remains. He carried out his instructions with skill and care ; left a supply of provisions at Cooper's Creek for the rescue of any future explorers who might reach it in distress, and then, in order to open up new country, came back by way of Adelaide. In January 1863 he was in Melbourne with the remains. A great public funeral was accorded to them on the 2 1st of that month, public bodies and dignitaries, with all classes of the population, uniting in following the mournful relics to their last resting place in the Melbourne Cemetery, where a huge block of unhewn granite was afterwards placed as a memorial of the tomb where all that was left of the mortal tenement of two gallant souls was reverently deposited. A sum of \u00a35000 was voted by Parliament for the erection of a statue, which was subsequently cast in bronze, \u2014 a group interesting in design, though with faults of execution, but very touchingly suggestive of the mutual respect and friendship of the two men. It was the work of Charles Summers, and was the object of much affectionate regard among the colonists, as being not only the tribute to their popular heroes, but also the first work of art on a notable scale which the colony had produced. It was designed and modelled in their own Collins-street by their own Charles Summers, and was set up as a prominent feature on the choicest site of the city; and there was no object that so readily woke a throb of national sentiment as the bronze group on the hill, where Wills sat busy with his scientific work while Burke stood affectionately by, as he must often have done in life. Victoria spent over \u00a315,000 in the actual expedition itself, \u00a316,000 in relief expeditions, but other disbursements made the total cost exceed \u00a335,000. In addition, the colony was glad to7ffer annuities to Wills' mother and to Burke's only connection, his aged foster-nurse. And so the curtain fell on a notable incident ; people returned to their daily avocations, and the excitement was over. In all hearts, however, there remained the sound of the names of Burke and Wills as a familiar echo that could never die away, and throughout the colony no names"], [426, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 404 BURKE AND WILLS' MONUMENT. are more familiar, none awaken so immediate a response, as those of the men that perished beside Cooper's Creek. But there is little need to dwell on the pathetic side ; neither Burke nor Wills looked for pity. They rather died with the triumph of men who had cheerfully yielded their lives to duty. Sad tributes of tears and tearful verses have been paid to their memory, but much juster the manly ring of Adam Lindsay Gordon : \u2014 With the pistol clenched in his failing hand, With the death mist spread o'er his fading eyes, He saw the sun go down on the sand, And he slept, but he never saw it arise. 'Twas well ; he toiled till his task was done, Constant and calm in his latest throe. The storm was weathered, the battle was won, When he went, my friends, where we all must go.\""], [427, "EIGHT HOURS' DAY \u2014 THE TRADES' PROCESSION. CHAPTER XXI protection to IRattve Jnbustrg.\u2014 18601-0 1866 Lggji jjl^ Hh: Ministry that assumed office on the 26th November 1860 was most emphatically \"'&fi$ *\u00a7\u00a7&$ I a PC0Ple's Ministry. Its Premier, Richard Heales, has long been held in memory mir] T*W& ' by t,1C u'c\"'kin7 classes as one of their peculiar heroes ; not that he was a man K&M nlllrl \"'\" any sin7ular ability, but that his views were most entirely their views, and that his policy was devoted to their interests. His Cabinet were all dear to the populace. Richard Davies Ireland, the eloquent barrister, was Attorney-General, and when he retired in July 1861 he was succeeded by Butler Cole Aspinall, equally a favourite. George Frederic Verdon was the Treasurer \u2014 a man who, from the comparatively narrow sphere of a business in Williamstown, was beginning to take some public rank as a financial expert. James Macpherson Grant and R. S. Anderson, Thomas Loader and John B. Humffray, once secretary of the Ballarat Reform League, now occupant of the newly-formed office of Minister of Mines, all added strength to this Ministry. But yet it was not destined to a long existence. Heales represented the extreme advanced views in democracy. He led the way to changes in which the working classes supported him, but which they were not to secure without a long and strenuous struggle, in the very beginning of which he was ejected from power. Heales proposed, in August 1861, to introduce three measures. First, the payment of members of Parliament\u2014 a matter in which the working classes had a just and far-seeim*"], [428, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 406 appreciation of their own interests. It was impossible that poor men, however shrewd, however trusted, however educated, could enter the House of Assembly so long as no payment was offered for service there. On the other hand, it was impossible, while only the wealthier and more leisured classes held legislative positions, that the wishes, and even the just requirements, of the working classes could be properly known or duly supported. This measure, therefore, was consistently maintained by the general body of the people as a fundamental principle of democracy. A great deal was to be said against it, and among its advocates there were more than one self-seeking demagogue ; but certainly the working man had at that time a clear and consistent idea of the importance of this concession so far as he was concerned, and an equal determination to secure it. Secondly, Heales proposed to reform the constitution of the Upper House. So long as that consisted of members all possessed of at least .\u00a35000, and elected by owners of not less than .\u00a31000 worth of property, it represented a comparatively small body. Its action, therefore, was necessarily conservative, and the democracy saw with regret that measures of a popular tendency could not be urged forward with that fiery zeal which alone would satisfy it. Lastly, Heales proposed to readjust the tariff so as to make it in some degree protective of the industries of the colonies. It was a strange sensation to many to find the very position in which the wealthy classes of England had so long entrenched themselves against the vehement agitation of the democratic elements, now held in turn by the democrats in the colony against the wealthier classes. But intrinsically there is in the system of protection to native industry nothing either democratic or the reverse. And the circumstances of the colony, truly enough, bound up the interests of a certain portion at least of the working classes with the policy of protection. Six years previously the effects of such a policy would have been wholly adverse to the interests of the multitude. The change that was now in course of progress was one due to the completely altered condition of the goldfields. From 1852 until 1857, they had been strictly \"poor man's diggings.\" Anyone with pick, shovel and tin dish could take his place with the rest, and if he had a few pounds to spend on a cradle, he was as well equipped for his work as the best of them. He might become either a \" surfacer \" or a \" shallow-sinker.\" In the first case he merely stripped the soil for a foot or two deep and washed it for its golden grains. In the second he sank his little pit some ten or twenty or thirty feet down, in hopes of reaching the ancient bed of the stream, and there lighting upon the \" wash-dirt,\" wherein perhaps there might lie a few \" pockets.\" But it was soon found that alluvial gold was not scattered broadcast over the country ; it lay in long lines, which represented the bygone beds of creeks. These lines were termed \" leads,\" and the middle of each was called its \" gutter,\" being the central hollow or depression of the ancient streamlet, wherein the gold had been most generously deposited. But when a hundred thousand persons had toiled on these lines for five years, the gold that was most easily accessible was necessarily exhausted. In these five years some sixty million pounds' worth had been collected. Six hundred tons of gold were not to be a second time so easily obtained. In the year 1855 the chief goldfields began to lose the character of being \"poor man's diggings.\" In 1857 none but the Chinese followed either surface or shallow sinking on the historic goldfields. It was, however, by no means true that the gold was exhausted ; it had now to be sought at deeper levels. The ancient river beds as they were followed down were found to be more and more covered over by the superimposed strata. The places where the gold was first discovered had doubtless been near the sources of streams that rose in ridges much more prominent"], [429, "PROTECTION TO NATIVE INDUSTRY.\u2014 1860 TO 1866. 407 than those of the present day. Their channels had run downwards to the plains ; but when the seas washed over these plains, the deposits of mud and clay and sand had raised the surface to a somewhat uniform level, and the golden treasures were more and more deeply covered as the distance from the sources increased. Deep sinking began to be common at Ballarat in 1855.' At that time shafts of 200 feet in depth became necessary, and for safety these had to be timbered all the way down, slabs of stringybark gumtree being placed inside as a lining. These were expensive shafts to prepare, more especially as the miner became more and more troubled with the inflow of water, and found it necessary to line the timbers with a backing of clay. When the \"lead\" was struck, the miners avoided the necessity of sinking another shaft by making horizontal \" drives,\" so as to extract the washdirt to right and left of the shaft. All this required capital, and the diggers who had saved some money in the early years now freely invested it in these deep sinkings at Ballarat. But co-operation was often necessary, and partnership arrangements became very common. People held \" shares\" in a mine, and sold them out according as necessity or policy prompted them. Often the actual diggers and the holders of the capital were not the same persons. Money was advanced by outsiders, who took so many shares in return for the investment of so much capital. So extensive became these operations that the buying and selling of shares began to make quite a business, and in two or three years the \" Corner\" became a notable institution of Ballarat. It was a large wooden building at the corner of Sturt and Lydiard streets, occupied as an ironmonger's store, but offices were let in it, and several firms of brokers made their headquarters there. At this corner gathered daily such as were interested in the various \" claims,\" to learn the news as to each ; which of them had \" bottomed,\" and which were being flooded out ; which of them were finding the gold grow thin, and which were showing signs of being among the pockets. Out of this daily muster grew the Ballarat Stock Exchange, and a similar gathering has been characteristic of Ballarat from that day to this.\" Further and further the miners followed up the leads, and deeper and deeper grew the shafts. Steam engines now became necessary, and on all sides their smoky chimneys began to appear. The first erected was at the end of 1855, but in three or four years they were greatly multiplied, and in 1863 more than two hundred of them vomited their wreathing smoke from the middle of sheds and stagings, and those erections known as \" poppet heads.\" To increase the difficulties of working these deep claims as the miners followed the course of the stream downward, it was discovered that great layers of bluestone lay between the surface and the ancient river bed four hundred feet below. In some places two, in others three, and frequently four layers had so to be pierced. What wondrous convulsions of nature did these beds of basalt reveal. The)- were vast sheets of lava which had poured in incandescent floods, white hot, but crawling in cohesive flow like treacle hissing, spluttering, and scorching over all the district. Starting from volcanoes many miles away, they had covered hundreds of square miles, and poured over the river beds of those bygone ages. Centuries had intervened between successive lava flows, and in the interval there had been formed great beds of sedimentary matter from seas and rivers. Now, the miner had to pierce his shaft through hard layers of solid rock, one about fifty feet in thickness, another nearly eight)'. Indeed in the White Horse Lead at Ballarat no less a depth than 180 feet had to be quarried and blasted through successive layers with infinite Report of Commission on State of Goldfields. - Withers, p. 236. Vol. I. i A"], [430, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 408 labour before the wash-dirt could be reached. Most of the companies occupied five years in penetrating this bluestone portion of the shaft ; and then they had to take some risk ; the lead might after all not lie near them ; they might have to carry their drives this way and that for a long time ere they could actually reach it. But when it was reached, the reward was generally rich. The washdirt was about six feet deep on an average, and it spread in a broad belt of from 200 to 600 feet in width. Away down there the tortuous sands of the ancient stream had grown rich with the golden dust, destined to rest through untold ages, till the miner's pick should awake it from its marvellous slumber. Great sums had generally to be expended before this precious deposit was reached. The Great Extended Company began sinking in 1856. It spent ,\u00a3125,000 in the process, and in 1860 gold began to be raised from a depth of 352 feet. Then they hauled it up at the rate of twelve or fifteen thousand pounds' worth per month, and in the next five years the total amount extracted was valued at \u00a3438,000. The Cosmopolitan Company is given as an illustrative one by Mr. Brough Smythe.3 Forty shareholders commenced work in 1857. Two and a-half years later they struck the gutter, at a depth of 366 feet, after passing through 140 feet of basalt. Their expenditure was \u00a3\u25a0 22,000. Then they began to obtain a return, and in three years the mine yielded a net profit of \u00a372,000 in dividends. The \" Nelson \" mine spent \u00a367,500 before reaching gold, and then found a fortune there for each of the shareholders. All this implied that there was still abundant scope for the gold-digger ; but he was no longer the sturdy man with a shovel, working on his own claim. He was rather the man of capital who could afford to put up machinery and employ a host of stalwart fellows for four or five years without return ; it was only the man who had already saved a few thousands who was able to gather the rich deposits beneath these basalt beds. In 1862 there were in Ballarat 448 shareholders who had on an average expended nearly \u00a3\"3000 a-piece, but who were then in receipt of annual incomes averag ing about ;\u00a3i400. One of the most remarkable instances of indomitable enterprise the world has seen was that which resulted in what was called the \"Band and Albion Consols.\"' In 1856 a band of 120 fairly successful miners, calling themselves \"The Band of Hope,\" started a shaft to penetrate the bluestone, in the hopes of reaching the \"Golden Point Lead\" below. Most of them could afford to work and wait for two or three years. They sank a trial shaft \u2014 it took them a year to pierce the rocks, \u2014 but then they were not on alluvial earth. Drives would have to be undertaken, and for these a wider shaft would be needed. They commenced it early in 1858. They had got to no great depth when the water began to pour in upon them. A pipe a foot in diameter was carried down, and a powerful engine pumped night and day in order to keep the shaft dry. In four years from starting they had pierced the first layer of basalt. But the soft earth below was almost a river. Through it there flowed a subterraneous stream of brackish water, with a mineral taste\u2014 this had to be pumped out as fast as it came in. Larger pipes and more powerful engines had to be supplied. All the original company were now exhausted of funds. Some had gone away and abandoned the enterprise. Some had sold portions of their shares for money to go on with. Some gave their eight hours a-day to the mine, and spent another period of four or six hours in \"surfacing\" in order to maintain themselves and their families. A second bed of rock had then to be pierced. They were through it in two years more ; and again came floods of water additional to what they had before. After sinking eighty feet into the third layer of rock, they were able to strike out in search of the \" lead,\" and 3 \"Goldfields of Victoria,\" p. 181. ' \"Tales of the Goldfields,\" by George Sutherland, M.A,"], [431, "PROTECTION TO NATIVE INDUSTRY.-1860 TO 1866. 409 upon careful deliberation chose a south-easterly direction. They tunnelled for 180 feet, and reached auriferous clay, but it was poor stuff, scarcely paying the cost of washing ; and moreover, from the new strata the water flowed in at a prodigious rate, bearing with it hundreds of tons of loose sand. Thick barriers of clay, backed up by great frames of timber, failed to keep back these floods. They were swept away, and time after time the miners had to retreat before the rapidly rising waters. It was not till they had struggled for eight years, and spent \u00a330,000, that they had overcome the preliminary difficulties, and were at last four hundred feet deep in a dry mine. They started a new drive, and after proceeding 200 feet came upon a \" lead.\" It was moderately good, but not the Golden Point Lead ; they were preparing, however, to work it, when suddenly in burst the water, more impetuously than ever. What a steady faith must have impelled these fortune-seekers to go on afresh ! They put down pipes nearly two feet in diameter, bought the largest steam-engine to be had, but then their resources of all sorts were exhausted. They could go no further alone. There was, however, a neighbouring company \u2014 the Hand-in-Hand \u2014 which had experienced a similar fortune, though with larger reserves of capital. The two companies agreed to join forces, and having united under the name of the Hand and Band, resolved to work the Band of Hope shaft. Ten years from the commencement of this formidable struggle the workmen burst into the golden soil, and the prize proved worth the winning. Lines of tramway were laid down in the drives; trucks busily carried the wash-dirt \u2014 seven hundred tons a-day \u2014 to the foot of the shaft, there to be raised and washed. The company then for a long time secured a thousand pounds' worth of gold per day. There had been spent in all .\u00a3150,000 in reaching the gold; now there was brought up a total of \u00a3\"656,000 in about two years. Not far away there was another company called the \"Albion.\" It was formed in 1856 by seventy-two persons, mostly Scotchmen. For ten years it toiled with equal determination and tenacity. It spent \u00a31 20,000 in sinking to a depth of 475 feet, and then began to take out gold, which in two or three years amounted to \u00a3\"337,000. The two companies began, however, to intrude on each other's ground ; a lawsuit was started, but eventually compromised by the amalgamation of the two under the name of the Band of Hope and Albion Consols Com pany, familiarly known as the Band and Albion. In 1869 it owned eleven steam-engines and sixteen puddling machines, and nineteen horses were employed underground on the tramways. From that time till this it has gone on working without cessation, and is still the premier mine of Ballarat. Its total yield of gold has been more than two and a-half millions of pounds. The dividends have amounted to over a million. It is said to have 120 miles of tunnels underground. These and other shafts were started by working miners who had gathered some money, but in 1859 and 1860 the conditions of the work began to change. The capitalists advanced the money ; the miner hired himself for a wage \u2014 at first \u00a34 a week, then only \u00a3\"3, and in 1862 it barely averaged \u00a3\"2 10s. At that rate, however, he was well off, the cost of living having declined to less than half what it was in 1853. Ballarat steadily progressed, and in 1861 had 21,000 permanent residents. One hundred and nine streets, with a hospital, an asylum, a town hall, nine banks, gasworks, markets, parks, reserves, a botanic garden, and no less than thirty-one schools testified to the solidity of its progress. Meantime a process, different in manner, yet identical in results, had been going on at Sandhurst and at Castlemaine. There the miners had discovered no beds of basalt concealing the richer deposits. But they had emptied the leads, and then found it necessary to go out on"], [432, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 410 either side and to laboriously wash the earth of the valleys broadcast for the little gold that was scattered throughout it. In order to make so large a process pay, it was impossible that the old tin dish or cradle could suffice. Puddling machines were now necessary. These were not of extravagant cost\u2014 a machine could be had for about \u00a375; a horse had then to be bought,\u2014 but \u00a3100 would set the digger going. In 1855 there were 203 of these machines at Castlemaine, and over 2000 at Sandhurst. Co-operation here increased the efficiency of the work. If half-a dozen men combined to invest \u00a3200 among them in a machine, together with three or four horses and carts, they could make claims profitable that otherwise would have been but poor concerns. There was an end even to this, however, and the diggers began to ask, .why should they not attack the quartz from which the gold all came originally? If dug out and crushed it must be much richer than the general soil of the country. But to get it out and extract its gold would be a costly process, and external capital was invited to join in the experiment. It was freely enough contributed, and before long Sandhurst also was well supplied with companies. In 1860, what with pumping machines to keep the mines free from water, and stamping machines to pound the quartz, or mills in which to roll it and crush it by heavy wheels ; what with steam engines and gear for raising the quartz from considerable depths, over half a million of money had been invested in quartz mines at Sandhurst alone ; 10,000 men and 400 steam engines were there at work, and they turned out annually gold to the value of a million and a-half of money. In 1865 there were 17,000 men engaged in quartz mining, with nearly 600 steam engines, working 2000 distinct reefs, and raising two million pounds' worth of gold annually. These belonged to the Bendigo district. In the midst there was growing up a permanent city, Sandhurst, with a fixed population of 13,000 so early as 1861. It had eight banks, three theatres, a hospital, a benevolent asylum, a Masonic hall, a mechanics' institute, a botanic garden, two building societies, and two daily newspapers. Clunes never had much reputation till quartz-mining began. Then the Port Phillip Company, in the nine years from 1857 to 1866, obtained three-quarters of a million worth of gold from the one claim. Beechworth saw the same change take place, and Tarnagulla, with its \" Poverty\" reef, became famous as a rich district. At a later date Gippsland sprang into note, Wood's Point being long a favourite ; but Walhalla, with its Long Tunnel Company yielding gold to the value of a million and three-quarters, has, perhaps, the most triumphant record of all. Stawell, with its Pleasant Creek shafts giving a million and a-quarter to one company, Daylesford, Maldon, Dunolly, Maryborough, all exhibited the same change. Gold mining became a speculation for capital, not for unassisted labour. At first the proprietors of the mines formed partnerships. From twenty to one hundred and twenty joined in sinking and working a shaft, and a share was worth from a thousand to three thousand pounds. But, about 1859, the custom rapidly grew of multiplying these into shares of smaller value \u2014 twenty pounds, ten pounds, or even one pound. These were open for anyone to purchase who chose, scrip was duly issued, boards of directors appointed, and all the forms of large companies were observed; the prices of shares began to form a daily item in the columns of the newspapers, and dividends were paid in city offices to people who knew nothing of mines, but who had staked a few pounds in what was a sort of legitimate gambling. The majority of these would have done better to have left the shares alone, for there was that other periodical process, the paying of calls which was apt to overbalance the dividends, and which about 1860 became a predominant feature in mining experience."], [433, "PROTECTION TO NATIVE INDUSTRY.\u2014 1860 TO 1866. 411 Taking advantage of the raining mania that then prevailed, and the facility of disposing of shares at excellent rates, many companies started that were clearly doomed to failure. Some were fraudulent from the beginning ; others were not prepared with funds for the four or five years of constant expense that were generally necessary. They collapsed before the gold was reached. Others bottomed after long and ruinous expenditure to find the soil below too poor to pay. Others that had begun to pay entered into litigation about the boundaries of claims and the extent of their underground drives, and so lost all their profits. In these and other ways a great number of companies died out of existence about 1861 and 1862. The Monte Christo, the Reform, the Eaglehawk, the Bolivia, the Perseverance, the Beehive, the Atlas, the Concord, the Grand Junction, are names awakening pathetic images of vanished coin to many an elderly colonist. In 1860 these and other companies found their shares running up to magnificent prices, but they were mostly gone or going in 1862. Their experience was a warning to the general public, and in 1865 capital from without was not so easily obtained for use upon the goldfields. All this had a decided effect upon the labour market. In 1855 no miner would work in another man's employment for less than \u00a3\"6 a week. But as surface mining ceased to pay, when shallow sinkings no longer yielded their former results, the miners were forced by thousands to seek employment. They found it with the companies. They toiled like navvies to blast a shaft through the bluestone at Ballarat, or to quarry out and crush the quartz at Sandhurst, Castlemaine, Beechworth, or Maldon. At first the weekly wage was \u00a3\"4, but that was a high rate for mere labourers' work, and the supply of labour was constantly increasing as more and more of the miners left their independent ventures. In 1859 the regular wage for a miner was \u00a33 a week, in 1862 it did not average more than \u00a32 10s., and it had every prospect of still descending. Indeed, in 1865 there were many districts where miners could readily be had for \u00a32 or 35s. per week. It is easy to guess the result of so rapid a change. Thousands of men abandoned the calling of the miner. Those who had been of the labouring class in Europe, were content, no doubt, to accept this kind of work at wages certainly three times as much as they had received in the old world. But mechanics of all sorts, and men who were of somewhat delicate nurture, were not likely to drop down to labourers' work at labourers' wages without making an effort for something better. They abandoned that mode of life, and fell back upon the various callings to which they had been trained in early days. In 1859 the miners numbered 125,000, in 1860 they had diminished to 108,000, and that in spite of the fact that the colony had gained 6000 men by immigration during the year. In 1861 they had still further diminished to 100,000, and in 1863 to 89,000, and yet there was no appreciable diminution of the men in the colony. In 1865 they numbered only 82,000. Hence, the numbers engaged in other vocations of necessity began to swell, and in consequence the rate of payment steadily decreased. The masons, who in 1857 had numbered 3100, were, in 1861, 4200, a rate of increase five times as great as that of the male population of the colony. But their wages, which were six pounds per week in 1854, declined to five in 1857, then to four in 1861, and in 1865 they were rarely three, the rate varying between eight shillings and ten shillings a day. The same tale was told of all the trades. Plasterers had fallen from the glory of twenty-five shillings a day to eight or ten ; blacksmiths, who in 1857 numbered 3700, were, in 1861, increased to 5600, but their wages had fallen from an average of twenty-two shillings per day to less than nine shillings. Carpenters, painters, bricklayers, all classes of workmen, even those whose work could not be imported, and much more those"], [434, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 412 who had to compete with foreign manufacturers, saw their wages diminished with remarkable rapidity, and looking into the future they foresaw with no great satisfaction a continuation of the process. In this they were probably wrong. In all probability the rates of wages would have recovered to an average of about ten shillings a day for skilled labour in a perfectly natural manner. But it is not to be wondered at that the mechanic of those days entertained fears for the future. Not that his position was one of discomfort, for the cost of living was now little greater than in England, the matter of rent being the only item seriously in excess ; but he had come a long way from his friends to better his fortune, and great would be his disappointment if he, after all, was to have but the same remuneration in the new land as he had had in the old. The shoemaker and the tailor who left their benches in Europe to gather gold in Victoria found themselves by compulsion turned into labourers. Not the free and independent miner of old ; solitary digging and surface washing no longer yielded a decent living. Their only resource was to seek for work with the companies, and take the wages of unskilled labour, for which their muscles were unsuited. They had not the alternative of returning to their trades for the shoes required in the country were almost all imported, and so were the clothes. The same difficulty was before the engineer and the printer, the coachmaker and the cabinetmaker. All classes of workmen whose work might be imported wholly or in part, had to face the dilemma that either they were not wanted in the colony or else they must adapt themselves to labourers' work in mines or upon farms. Large numbers did in fact adopt a farmer's life, but it was often a mistake for a man bred as a tailor in London to assume the responsibilities of a farmer in Victoria. He knew nothing of the art ; he had to toil like a slave, and generally made scarcely a living out of it. But in 1859 there began to be talked of a new method of meeting the difficulty. Keep out the foreign-made shoes and clothes, and engines ; the books, and carriages, and furniture of other countries, by placing on them prohibitive duties at the Customs House. In 1861, when the failure of bubble companies threw numbers of men out of employment, when every interest of the colony seemed to take a sudden pause in the marvellous course of progress it had exhibited for six or seven years, the demand for this new system made itself audibly heard. Some tradesmen wished it because in no other way did it seem possible for them to remain in the colony. Some whose labour would always be necessary in a large population, supported it because they connected the decline in their own wages with the numbers of unemployed in other callings. The farmer, poor fellow, supported it because he was told that he too would be protected when the new system came into effect. In short, the whole of the working classes began, but only by degrees, to band themselves together for this new idea, man)- of them not at all out of personal interest, but rather out of a class-feeling that made a working man determined to maintain the rights of his fellow working-man against all comers. And so came the principle of protection to native industries, of heavy Customs duties, and high priced necessaries as part of the democratic policy in Victoria ; though the democracy of England, less than a generation before, had fought a strenuous battle against them, and won the victory against the vested interests of protected classes. The question of protection and its effects is one of singular intricacy ; there can be no doubt that the broad issue of such a policy is the diminution to an appreciable extent of a community's wealth ; but that is always supposing that there already exists an abundant field for the energies of all the population already in the country. It might easily happen that ten"], [435, "PROTECTLON TO NATLVE INDUSTRY.\u2014 1860 TO 1866. 413 per cent, or more of a community might fail to find a livelihood in the country, and depart for foreign parts. What the precise effect would be of that emigration on the remainder of the population is too complicated a problem for science to unravel. On some individuals it would have a beneficial effect ; on others one equally injurious ; on many no great effect at all. But what the total might be it would be impossible to prophesy, and only experience could decide If the community lost by having to pay more than the general market price for many commodities it may, perhaps, have gained to an equal extent by the retention of twenty or thirty thousand active and intelligent workers who must otherwise have left it. In all probability, however, the general effect in the colony has been to diminish somewhat the accumulation of wealth, but on the other hand to cause its more even distribution. Money has, perhaps, not gathered quite so rapidly as it might have done, but on the other hand it has not gone so much to form large fortunes for the few. It has been scattered through the ranks of the industrious and frugal of the working classes. That result in a colony like Victoria might perhaps have justified the policy, but for the fact that no one yet can tell what Nemesis, perhaps, awaits it when other colonies and other states shall retaliate. As in some problem wherein the mathematician sets himself to calculate with figures and equations, and to prophesy the effect of certain experiments, he finds that what with adjustments upon adjustments, limitations affecting limitations, allowances for interactions, and actions upon interactions, he is in the midst of a whirl of complication such as all the skill of a Helmholtz or a Clerk-Maxwell cannot hope to disentangle. So the political economist, turning his eyes from the established interests of older countries to the condition of a country such as Victoria was in 1862, must confess himself unable to solve the transcendental equation. If it could have been reduced to a few principal terms it might have been easy; but, as it is, the facts must be gathered from experience, and not from calculation. Yet, in the years from 1859 to 1868, many a man in Victoria, many thousands of men, set themselves to work in order to think it out. The working classes clearly saw that the advantage in the meantime must lie with themselves. Wise heads fell back upon scientific works and the authority of political economists, but finding little there that was directly applicable, began to argue out the matter in all its bearings for themselves ; and for ten years this colony was like one vast debating club, where the question of free-trade or protection was the prevailing subject for discussion. In 1859 it was a notable fact that no educated man was in favour of protection. In November of that year, when an election was to take place for East Melbourne, the protectionist party, then small, and consisting of a few active working men, fluent speakers, some of them with Chartist training, could find no candidate to support their views. James M'Culloch, William Nicholson, and Wilson Gray were the three gentlemen nominated. The working men sent a deputation to each . to ask his views as to this question, which was not yet regarded as a matter of practical politics. The trades' associations held a meeting to receive the report. It was large and disorderly. The report was that all three were unsound as to protection, but there was no other candidate to be had. The working man was recommended to give his vote to Wilson Gray, as being the most likely in the end to pass over to protectionist views. After a turbulent meeting, the gas was turned out, and no motion carried ; but the affair called attention to the fact that protection was a working man's affair, that it could not readily be carried through a Parliament consisting of importers, squatters, professional men, and others whose incomes would not be improved by such a fiscal policy, but whose expenditure would certainly be increased."], [436, "VICTORIA AND LTS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 414 The working man, therefore, felt that if he was to secure his object he must have representatives of his own order in Parliament. But for that purpose there must be payment of members. Hence there came a strict alliance between these two measures, and payment of members was regarded as a necessary preliminary to a protective fiscal policy. On 9th February, 1859, Mr. Perry, in the Legislative Assembly, moved that members be paid a reasonable sum for their services. There was no discussion, but some surprise was felt at the closeness of the division. The majority which threw out the proposition was only eight in excess of the minority. On 15th December, when the estimates were being considered, Mr. Barton moved that a sum should be provided for the payment of members. On this occasion the discussion was long and able. Barton mainly relied on the broad principle that if members were paid, their constituencies would have a legal right to claim their time and attention ; but that if they were unpaid, it could not but be ungracious to call a man to account for the manner in which he performed gratuitous services. O'Shanassy thought that members were entitled at least to compensation for actual expenditure. William Don maintained that it would be an advantage to arrange so that men of all ranks and all interests would be able to sit in Parliament if their fellows chose them and had confidence in them. This time the motion was carried by thirty-four to thirty-one, but on being sent up to the Council, it was summarily rejected, and there, for the time being, the matter was allowed to rest. Nicholson's Ministry was at that time in office, but in November 1860, as already related (p. 382), it resigned. The new leader chosen to form a cabinet was Richard Heales, a protectionist, and a supporter of the principle of payment for members of Parliament. He had come to the colony as a mechanic in 1842, and after a few years had become proprietor of the coachmaking establishment where he had at first toiled before the bench. In 1849 he entered into public life, and in 1857 was returned for the East Bourke boroughs. But, though now well-to-do, he still had a warm affection for the interests of the class he had sprung from. His ardent zeal in the cause of temperance kept him well in touch with the masses, and he was one of the first to be infected with the new protectionist ideas of 1859.3 Hence his accession to power in 1860 was a peculiar gratification to the trades' associations. But his views were not those of the Assembly, and it was not long before differences arose and an adverse vote was passed. It was generally expected that Governor Barkly would call for his resignation, and procure the formation of a new ministry. But Heales asserted that he had the country with him ; and Barkly consented to give him the chance of a new election. It was in July 1861, therefore, that the battlefield first saw the opposing lines definitely drawn out that were so long to hold the colony in excitement. The working men made themselves ready to take part in the struggle. They held a meeting to discuss the proper steps for securing the return of protectionists to Parliament ; and it was there that Graham Berry first made a prominent appearance, a politician destined to take the foremost place in the ranks of the protectionists. He acquired from the first a great moral force by being in earnest, and by being thorough in his views. Whether right or wrong, he held a strong conviction, and whilst others adopted protection with hesitation or with reserve, or merely because of the popular vehemence, Graham Berry kept himself ahead of popular feeling, and led the people instead of suffering himself to be led by them. He had come to the colony in the early 1 Blair's \"Cyclopedia of Australia,\" p. 170."], [437, "PROTECTION TO NATIVE INDUSTRY\u2014 1860 TO 1S66. 415 times of the gold excitement, had opened a shop, and succeeded ; had entered Parliament for East Melbourne in 1860, and now came forward as a candidate with extreme protectionist views. In this election campaign he stated that two years before, when he maintained the desirability of a moderate degree of protection, he was laughed at, but that now there was more attention given to the proposal, and it began to form part of the practical politics of the colony. In the Brighton election, George Higinbotham declared against protection, but allowed that in a new country it could serve no useful purpose to apply the arguments based on the experience of nations with totally different conditions. He was opposed to payment of members, but thought that electorates might themselves strike a rate, and if they chose, might raise a sum for the payment of their members. Sir Francis Murphy was more decided in his opposition to popular views ; William Nicholson was against both protection and payment of members, but these were questions, as he considered, of little importance. The working men held no such opinion. A candidate like L. L. Smith, who proposed to abolish most of the taxes on necessary articles, and to place heavy ones instead on luxuries and on articles that could be manufactured in the colony, was much more to the people's taste. Verdon, at Williamstown, as being the Treasurer, was listened to with peculiar interest as he unfolded his succeeded well as a merchant and importer, and had almost immediately after taken an in terest in public affairs, was an uncompromising opponent of the new proposals. So also was Charles Sladen, who had been a solicitor in Geelong from 1842, and having gathered a large business had become a professional man very well known in the community. He had been returned by Geelong to the first Assembly, but now, on again presenting himself, his hostility to popular views cost him his seat. views. He did not consider that the colony had many manufactures to protect ; but such as there were he would favour with a tax that should be protective to a mild extent. Heales, however, the Premier, spoke out with no uncertain sound. He would support an efficient system of protection, and he declared himself of recent years a convert to the principle of paying members of Parliament as a necessary com plement of popular government. James Service, who had joined the colony in 1853, who had (SIR) GRAHAM BERRY. But the community had by no means a unanimous faith in the new recipe for producing universal prosperity, and the elections returned the two parties very evenly divided, the free-traders being slightly in the ascendancy. The Assembly met on the 30th of August, 1 86 1, but it was not till the 30th of October that the contest was begun. Mr. Verdon then brought forward his estimates. He wished to reduce the export duty on gold. That duty was half-a-crown an ounce. But in these times, when gold was obtained by expensive machinery, out of ever)- four pounds received for an ounce of gold, only ten shillings perhaps was profit. To take a quarter of that away in the shape of a tax was a serious weight upon the industry. It often caused a mine to be closed. The company would perhaps be willing to work at a profit of ten shillings an ounce, but not for seven and sixpence. To relieve the gold miners, therefore, the duty would be reduced to a shilling per ounce ; a change that would cause a loss JB Vol. 1"], [438, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT 416 of two or three hundred thousand pounds per annum to the revenue. To make good this loss, he proposed to place taxes of a moderate amount on such articles as could be produced in the colony. In 1852 customs duties had been levied on spirits, wines, ales and tobaccoes \u2014 all articles generally recognised as suitable for taxation. The only other imports that were taxed were tea, sugar and coffee \u2014 articles selected by political economists as the fairest to adopt, because, while they were universally consumed, they were not really necessary; so that while on the one hand the great body of the people would contribute to the revenue, yet, on the other hand, the absolutely necessitous would not be taxed in those simpler goods which alone his means permitted him to purchase. But Verdon criticised this tariff on democratic grounds. The incidence of taxation, he thought, was too even ; under it the poor man who probably consumed as much spirits and tobacco, as much tea, sugar and coffee as the wealthy man, paid as much in taxes as his richer neighbour, and, therefore, wealth did not take a proper share of the burdens of the State. O'Shanassy and Service were severe in their opposition to the budget proposals, and maintained that on the one hand the existing system of taxation was perfectly just, and that on the other such a revised tariff as Verdon proposed would kill the commerce of Melbourne. It seemed clear at that date that Melbourne was destined to be the great commercial centre of Australia. The adoption of a protective system would, they said, destroy that prosperity, yet fail to establish lucrative manufactures. Heales emphasised the fact that the new tariff was intended to relieve the poor, and cast more of the burden of taxation on the rich. Graham Berry, Macpherson Grant, and William Don strenuously supported the Government proposal, but Gavan Duffy condemned it as being a mere sham. Of what avail were five or ten per cent, duties ? If they were to have a protective tariff, let it be one truly protective. O'Shanassy moved, at the close of a long discussion, that \"this House, having maturely considered the estimate of income for 1862 submitted by the Government, is of opinion that it is unreliable and unsatisfactory.\" Nicholson seconded the resolution, stating that he clearly foresaw the downfall of Melbourne's commercial supremacy if such a measure were adopted, and J. G. Francis, destined ere long to be a staunch advocate of protection, supported the motion. He had come to Melbourne from Tasmania in 1853, and starting in mercantile pursuits at a favourable season, had made a splendid business, and had become wealthy. He now described to the Assembly how extensive was the custom for buyers to come from all the colonies and purchase their goods in Melbourne as the general metropolis. It was clear, he said, that under the proposed system all this must come to an end, and the trade of the port must be ruined. The voting went against the Government, O'Shanassy's motion being carried by forty votes against thirty-four. Heales resigned on the 12th of November 1861, and O'Shanassy was called on to form a ministry. It is indicative of the somewhat unformed condition of politics in the country, that two of the former ministerial party were included in the new cabinet. Gavan Duffy became the president of the Board of Land and Works, and R. D Ireland retained under O'Shanassy the same office of Attorney-General that he had held under Heales. Haines became treasurer; J. Dennistoun Wood was the Minister of Justice ; and R. S. Anderson t6 \u00b0f CUSt\u00b0mS ; Whil\u00a3 the P\u00b0siti0n \u00b0f Commissioner of Railways was filled by W.

He now made an efficient manager of our incipient railways. Parliament having been elected more or less distinctly on the issue of protection or free-trade, and the majority being freetraders, the question. necessarily lay in abeyance, so far as Parliament was concerned, until either the effluxion of its three years' duration, or till its dissolution for some other reason. But there was no want of activity among the artisan classes. The mechanics, who were most directly interested, kept up a constant agitation, and by degrees induced those of the people whom protection would affect less beneficially to join in their demand for a revised tariff. This agitation, however, was mostly in the form of trade meetings and debates, which did not distract the country in its general progress. Affairs proceeded in quiet and steady fashion; the beginning of 1862 saw the general grief and excitement during the return of the relief parties, and the burial of the remains of Burke and Wills. There was the steady tale of the formation of gold-mining companies, which now resumed activity; the population increased some twelve or fifteen thousand a year; and the farmers, now growing more and more numerous, added twenty or thirty thousand acres every year to the cultivated land of the colony. Herein lay a second strong subject of popular interest. Thousands of men, wearied of the goldfields, but seeing no other prospect of employment, were anxious to enter on a farmer's life, and desired to secure small holdings from the public lands. There was then no special facility for that purpose such as existed in America. McCulloch was the Premier, a merchant and importer, who had arrived in the colony in 1853, and had soon taken a prominent part in public affairs. His business interests would have made him a staunch freetrader, but a certain sympathy with the people and the struggles of men less favoured than him self by fortune, made him half inclined to try the new experiment which the people of the colony thought likely to renew their early prosperity. O'Shanassy and Duffy together framed new regula tions in a liberal direction, but after a long struggle, to be related hereafter,'1 they received a severe defeat upon a matter of comparative detail, and resigned. Their place was taken on 27th June 1863 by the strongest Ministry Victoria had yet seen. James (SIR) GEORO E F. VERDO Verdon resumed his place as Treasurer, with his leanings to protection decidedly increased in the interval ; James G. Francis was Commissioner of Customs\u2014 a man greatly trusted though of no commanding abilities. Richard Heales took a secondary place, but gave loyal service as President of the Board of Land and Works ; Macpherson Grant became Commissioner of Railways; but the great debating talent of the cabinet lay with the three eminent lawyers who held seats in it. George Pliginbotham was Attorney-General, a speaker of a dignified style, and classical precision of language. His pre-eminently honourable bearing, and his scorn of all that savoured of meanness, gave him an immense power with the community, though, as it perhaps erred a trifle in excess, it made him perceptibly less influential in politics, where a little capacity for compromise is always an clement in anything like pronounced success. Looking with a calm, dispassionate eye on the agitation for protection, he did not join with those who 6 Chapter XXIII."], [440, "VICTORIA AND LTS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 418 thought themselves able to balance all that tended for and all that tended against it. Pie recognised in it a most intricate problem. He held that in the main the scientific writers on political economy had proven that through the course of the fullest and least restricted trade lay the future of the prosperity of nations. But whether the manufacturing industries of a community just springing into existence ought to suffer all the rudeness of the shock of competition with the whole weight that an enormous accumulation of capital and generations of experience gave to older countries, he was by no means certain. To give them a ten years' start, and then call upon them to stand upon their own merits and to comply with the conditions which science declared most conducive to prosperity, might be a perfectly wise, as well as a kindly mode of proceeding. Archibald Michie, witty, genial, with a knack of handling abstruse subjects in a popular way, took the anti-popular side in almost everything. He had, however, earned the gratitude of the miners by his efforts for the Ballarat rioters, and though a keen and uncompromising opponent of protection, against which he argued with singular clearness and vivacity, he was by no means unpopular. He was the Minister of Justice in McCulloch's ministry. Thomas Howard Fellows, a barrister of distinction, who was a member of the Legislative Council, took office as Postmaster-General, but without salary. It was not a ministry formed on any definite principle, beyond the collection of as much talent as was procurable. On that question which was likely to be ere long the prime issue in the colony, they were of incongruous views. From the vigorous protectionist Heales, to the unswerving free-trader Michie, there were all degrees and grades of persuasion. But in the immediate present this caused no disturbance. They united in carrying on the business of the colony well and expeditiously. On the ioth September following, the Governor, Sir Henry Barkly, left the colony. He had held his position for seven years, and as that was the full term allowed by the Colonial Office, he was now to be transferred to the Mauritius. He had won the complete good-will of the community, his work having been carried out in a quiet, unostentatious, and impartial manner. He had lost his wife during the first year of his residence in Victoria. She had been killed by an accident on the Princes' Bridge, and public sympathy had been called forth upon that occasion, which induced a kindly feeling towards him among all classes ; but before he left our shores he found a second wife in the community, and his wedding here by no means diminished his popu larity. He left amid quiet, respectful demonstrations of good-will and remembrance. SIR HENRY BARKLY. On the following day, nth September 1863, the governorship was assumed by his successor, Sir Charles Henry Darling, nephew of that Sir Ralph Darling, who had been Governor at Sydney in 1825, and had ruled the colonists there in military fashion. Sir Charles arrived the day before Sir Henry departed. His frank, careless, easy-going openness of character, though it was eventually to bring him into trouble, made him eminently popular. A year later the Legislative Assembly became dissolved by the expiration of its three years. A new Assembly had to be elected; and now for the first time the question of"], [441, "PROTECTLON TO NATIVE INDUSTRY.- 1860 TO 1866. 419 protection became the absorbing issue. After a period of some excitement, there met, on the 2Sth of August 1864, an Assembly much more decidedly protectionist than any member of the cabinet. The question in dispute slumbered until the subject of ways and means once more should appear at the presentation of the annual budget. On 19th January 1865, Verdon, as Treasurer, made his budget speech. He proposed to give some relief to the mining classes by reducing the export duty on gold, and by diminishing the taxes on tea, sugar, and opium. The losses to the revenue thus produced he desired to make good by the imposition of small duties on articles hitherto untaxed, and for that purpose he had chosen articles such as might be made in the colony rather than those which it could not produce. Nathaniel Levi was the first to take up a position against the new proposal. He maintained that such taxation could never induce the growth of manufactures in the colony, while it would ruin the commerce of Melbourne, which, as he ominously prophesied, would be reduced to a mere village if these new principles were suffered to exert their blighting influence. O'Shanassy maintained that the new tariff would be neither protectionist nor free-trade. It would be nothing but a mere halting between two opinions. The country was in a sound and prosperous condition ; the existing tariff was working well. Why disturb it ? J. G. Francis and James McCulloch replied somewhat tamely ; and L L. Smith, with others who followed him, attacked the Government from the protection side, declaring that the new proposals were not nearly enough to satisfy the wishes of the people. W. M. K. Vale took up the same position more strongly, but Graham Berry threw himself with the most unhesitating ardour into the cause of protection. He would accept what the Government had offered as a poor preliminary \u2014 a somewhat mean first instalment \u2014 but a protective tariff, framed avowedly for the encouragement of local manufactures, was the least he should eventually be content with, and he u-as prepared to agitate till he obtained it. The first debating skill that was exhibited on behalf of free-trade was contained in the speech of Duncan Gillies, who, though a Ballarat member, yet did not fear to attack the new ideas with uncompromising severity. The tariff, as proposed, would fall heavily on the poorer classes, and give no possible stimulus to manufactures, while most certainly killing trade. Kerferd and Longmore took up the broad ground that legislation intended to benefit the poor man solely was class legislation, and therefore bad ; that their duty was to legislate for all, and to dispense an even-handed justice. The discussion continued till the last day of the month, and then a division was taken on a small point as a test of the feeling of the House. Was the duty on opium to be reduced ? A decided majority resolved that it should be. The Government was, therefore, victorious ; no further opposition was made ; the freetraders, seeing themselves out-numbered, suffered all the other items to pass. But now the Government began to be harassed by the protectionists, who not only demanded duties of a more prohibitive nature, but also proposed that instead of merely reducing the gold export duty, it should be wholly abolished ; and they carried a resolution affirming that such a change should take place from the end of 1866, the Assembly recognising that the almost unanimous wish of fifty or sixty thousand electors could not be ignored. Meanwhile, the Government's proposal and the debate in Parliament had stirred the political atmosphere into stormy vigour. The Chamber of Commerce, on the 23rd January, met to discuss the position of affairs. W. K. Thomson moved \" That the new tariff will inflict fatal injury on the trading interests of the colony.\" Sargood seconded this resolution, which was"], [442, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 420 carried by a large majority. Lorimer moved that a petition be presented to Parliament requesting it to appoint a committee for the purpose of hearing what the merchants had to say, and this also was carried. The jewellers held a meeting to protest against any duty upon jewellery. The bootmakers held a meeting to protest against the smallness of the duty on boots. Nothing less than fifteen per cent, would suffice, as they said, to give work to the bootmakers then idle in the colony. One speaker described pathetically the number of skilled shoemakers toiling at labourers' work for labourers' wages on the goldfields, whom a suitable tariff would restore to be the ornaments of society they were intended to be. The boot importers held a meeting to object to protective duties. The saddlers held a meeting to support them. The carriers, draymen and stevedores held a meeting to denounce protection and protectionists and all their ways. The masons held a meeting to secure the advantages of protection for their trade; though how it was to be done no one explained. And so the ferment worked ; all classes of men strenuous for their own interests. But on whatsoever side the arguments might be the weightier, certainly the voting power was with the protectionist party. On February 4th a great mass meeting was held in St. George's Hall, in Bourke-street. C. J. Jenner took the chair. He advocated protective views, and thought that the Government had halted at a lame and untenable position. They must make their policy more thorough to suit the wants of the colony. But Graham Berry was the hero of the evening. He came forward amid ringing cheers, and said that he would support the Government proposals, which were good so far as they went; but they must go forward, and give the manufacturing industries the encouragement and protection they greatly needed in a country, young and raw, that was flooded with the manufactured products of older countries and of starvation labour. They need have no scruple about the interests of the importers. These gentlemen had come to the colony at a period most opportune for themselves. They had found the community in a state of dire necessity in the gold excitement, and they had shorn it like a flock of sheep. As they had grown rich at the expense of the people,\" now let the people establish industries for their own good, even if these spoiled children of fortune, the importers, should suffer a little in the process. A motion in favour of the Government measure was carried by a great majority. At Geelong the largest meeting ever known in the town discussed a similar resolution, and passed it unanimously. At Ballarat and at Sandhurst also mass meetings by large majorities supported the Government proposals. The various suburbs of Melbourne, in the first fortnight of February, followed the same course, and on the 15th of that month the House of Assembly felt itself so strongly backed by public opinion that it took a further step in the popular direction, and passed resolutions in favour of additional duties, and ordering a new Customs and Excise Bill to be brought in. Thereupon the merchants of Melbourne and those whom a protective tariff would injure, formed a new society called the Free-trade League, to bring their pressure to bear upon the members of the Legislative Council, seeing that the Assembly was already in a hopeless case. Through their exertions it became fully known that an overwhelming majority of the Council would reject the new tariff. McCulloch and his cabinet with that prospect before them sat in long and earnest consultations. They certainly occupied an awkward position between the protectionist mass of voters on the one hand, and the free-trade Council, resolute and watchful, upon the other. Unluckily there was another bone of contention just then. On 15th February, George"], [443, "PROTECTION TO NATIVE INDUSTRY.\u2014 1860 TO 1866 421 Harker moved in the Assembly that for the satisfactory representation of the people members of both Houses of Parliament should receive compensation. The existing arrangements gave too large a proportion, he said, to the residents of Melbourne. People belonging to country towns could not afford to leave their businesses and come to Melbourne for months together. Hence the country districts had no choice but to elect Melbourne men, who could not properly advocate the country requirements. Out of seventy-eight members there were thirty-eight who were permanently resident in Melbourne. McCulloch and Levi wished that the payment to be made should be merely a compen sation for actual disbursements by members ; but Higinbotham thought that the nation as a whole should have full and firm control over its representatives, who therefore should be agents receiving a fixed salary for definite services to be rendered. He would pay them a yearly sum, not much inferior to the income of judges or minis ters of the Crown, for their duties were not less impor tant. McLellan, Edwards Ramsay, and G. V. Smith, all contended that the mere concession of manhood suf rage, and of the ballot, did not provide for the proper control by the people of their own affairs. Only when there was an adequate sum granted to members, on which the poor . man, if chosen to represent his fellows, might live in corn- fort, though not necessarily in dignity, could there be within Parliament a com plete representation of the general desire outside of it. Graham Berry strongs supported the motion, and urged that as the Council, in 1859, had rejected the proposal when the Assem bly, at the desire of the people, had passed it, they should now prepare to make a definite stand, and com pel the Council to accede to the wish of the com munity. (SIR) JAMES M'Cl'LLOCH. It was then moved that provision should be made in the Appropriation Bill for the payment of members. The result of such a proceeding must have been to compel the Upper House to consent to the new measure, or else throw out the Appropriation Bill, and with it refuse all supplies for the carrying out of the nation's business during the coming year. For by the Constitution Act, the Council was strictly precluded from amending or altering in any way the money bills that came to it from the Assembly. It must, therefore, swallow the new nostrum, or deprive the Government of finances for the next year. The Assembly resolved not to coerce the Council in this manner. It merely passed a resolution that it was desirable to grant compensation to members, and it petitioned the Governor to send down a separate bill to that effect for its consideration. Sir Charles Darling sent down a bill providing for the payment of three hundred pounds a year to members of Parliament. This bill was read in the Assembly a first time on 1st May, and passed on 6th May It was sent to the Council on 9th May, and there summarily rejected on the first reading. But this result had been fully expected, and McCulloch and his ministry had quite resolved that no such fate would overtake their tariff- proposals. On the 2nd March, he had informed the Assembly that he proposed to add to the Appropriation Pill, the clauses providing for the new arrangement of duties, and after a week of discussion, the Assembly, by a majority of two to"], [444, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLLS: PAST AND PRESENT. 422 one, determined to follow the course suggested, thus compelling the Council to make its choice between the acceptance of a protective measure and the derangement of public affairs. The Assembly was thus entering into a decided conflict with the Upper House, and its chance of success entirely depended on the strength of the popular feeling that supported it. The artisan classes at once made their voices heard. A meeting of four thousand in Collingwood passed a resolution urging the Government to carry out its proposal, and tack the protectionist clauses to the Appropriation Bill. In the course of the discussion, William Don and Graham Berry declared that with many of the semblances of a free and liberal Government, Victoria was in truth but an oligarchy so long as a Council elected by 9000 voters, all of them belonging to the wealthy classes, could dictate terms, and thwart the general desire of the people. A large meeting of working-men at St. George's Hall carried a similar resolution, and Berry took a tour through the country holding meetings in all the large towns ; at these there was much enthusiasm exhibited, and the motions they adopted were all intended to encourage the Government. The free-trade party held opposition meetings. Two thousand persons, admitted by ticket, gathered in St. George's Hall to hear Fawkner, as a member of the Council, explain his views. He said he was in theory a protectionist, but so long as the Government did not arrange for the protection of farmers, he would stoutly oppose their measure. A motion was carried to the effect that \" taxes should be levied for revenue purposes alone, and not for the purpose of benefiting one class of the community at the expense of another.\" In support of this reasonable proposition, several clever speeches were made, but in spite of these, the majority against the Government proposals was not more than two to one, in a meeting specially called by the free-traders. In South Yarra and Brighton, however, they showed more vigour in denouncing the policy of McCulloch. But it would be purposeless to follow the meetings that were held by scores all over the country. The arguments adduced were very fairly divided. Not so the people. An overwhelming majority had assumed the protectionist side. Hence, the Government felt strong, when Verdon rose in the Assembly on the 18th of July to introduce a bill, \"To grant Her Majesty certain duties of custom, and for appropriating the supplies granted, &c.\" The speaker, Sir Francis Murphy, stated that it was contrary to Parliamentary practice to join together bills of revenue and bills of supply. Thereupon a discussion ensued. Higinbotham stated that no precedent existed by which they could be guided, but that as a matter of fact, the House of Commons had in England, on several occasions, secured the adoption of financial measures, to which the House of Lords was opposed, by this very measure of tacking them to Appropriation Bills. However, he thought that nice rules as to these points might fairly enough be set aside, seeing that their main duty was now to give effect to the wish of the people. Nevertheless, at the Speaker's request, the two bills were divided, and referred separately to the committee of the whole House. Next day, the Government were resolved to carry matters in their own way. They introduced a resolution that the two bills be again conjoined. The Speaker pleaded that it was contrary to one of the standing orders, which ought to be set aside if the House persisted, so that he at least might be free from responsibility. Michie asked him if the Plouse of Commons did not undoubtedly possess the right to tack bills to the Appropriation Bill. The speaker allowed that it had, but that many generations had elapsed since it had availed itself of that power. G. V. Smith replied that of late years the Commons had not needed that expedient, as another had been found in the practice of \" swamping \" the House of"], [445, "PROTECTLON TO NATIVE INDUSTRY.\u2014 1860 TO 1866. 423 Lords by the creation of new peers, whenever a violent collision occurred between the two Houses. Michie maintained that the Lower House had the full and unrestricted control of the finances, and as this was a financial question, they must take the proper means to assert their power. The Assembly directed the bills to be conjoined ; read them together three times as one bill, and passed them by a majority of 41 to 16. On 2 1st July the united bill, for appropriation and for certain alterations in the tariff, was read a first time by the Council. Nothing was done beyond the formal reading. Four days later, when the second reading came on, the Council received petitions from nearly thirty thousand persons begging it to reject the protectionist clauses ; and others from about six thousand desiring it to agree with them. Thus fortified, the Council resolved by twenty to five that the bill should be laid aside. Two days later, McCulloch moved in the Assembly that no further bill for the appropriation of supplies should be entertained till the Council adopted the altered tariff. So the country had to enter on the new financial year without finances, and a month later Verdon published in the Government Gazette a notice that all public payments would cease till the necessary sums should have been voted. It was not, of course, that there was no money. All taxes, all forms of revenue, poured in as usual ; but until Parliament had appropriated these funds to their different uses they could not be employed, but must gather in the Treasury untouched. Immediately after the resolution of the Assembly had been passed, the Government had begun to collect the new duties at the Customs House. The importers paid the sums so demanded, but under protest ; and in August a series of Supreme Court actions began, the merchants suing the Government for the restitution of duties illegally collected. Judgment was given in their favour, as indeed there could be no doubt that the Ministry were assuming an autocratic position which the laws of the country did not permit. Yet the Manufacturers' Association in Melbourne passed a vote of thanks to the Ministry for its action, while the Industrial League at Ballarat resolved to give its strenuous support to the course pursued by the Government. The advocates of the Council complained that they could obtain no chance of expressing their views. If they called a meeting, it was immediately swamped by the working men, who took the management of affairs into their own hands. On the 7th of August they summoned a large meeting of freetraders to be held in St. George's Hall, in Bourke-strect. Mr. Lorimer presided. He stated that the press of Victoria was by an overwhelming majority in favour of free-trade, and opposed to the action of the Assembly, and that their enlightened opinion was much more reliable than the noise and faction of the mob. J. D. Wood, at that time regarded as a great free-trade champion, moved \" that the Ministry has set the law and constitution at defiance.\" James Service seconded the motion, which was duly carried. But at the same hour there gathered a meeting, six or seven times as large, in the Eastern Market hard by. There the chief members of the Protection League harangued a crowd of from six thousand to ten thousand persons. They asked whether the people or an irresponsible Council was to rule Victoria. They wanted to know if the Council would persist in its folly till an Oliver Cromwell appeared to sweep it out of existence. In Sandhurst a meeting was called to condemn the action of the Ministry. There were two thousand five hundred persons present, and the mayor, who presided, declared that the feeling of the meeting was almost unanimous in savour of McCulloch and his action. & Meantime the Council quietly endured the storm of popular indignation. They would not pass the Appropriation Bill, and the civil servants, and the crowds of other people wl- Vol. I. 3 C"], [446, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 424 depended on Government payments for subsistence, remained unpaid for three months. The Assembly passed a resolution requesting the Governor to take such steps as in the opinion of his advisers would obviate the difficult)' ; which was a merely euphemistic way of asking the Governor to help the Assembly in the contest. On the 29th of August there came a message from Governor Darling, who said he would gladly interpose to enable the Government to resume payments, but that both by the Constitution Act and by the Audit Amendment Act, he was forbidden to sanction the issue of moneys unless made legally available by an Act passed by all three branches of the Legislature, and he could therefore sign no Treasury warrants He communicated with the Upper House in relation to the deadlock ; it replied that it was prepared to pass the Appropriation Bill at once, if sent up to it in its ordinary form. The Council had held the field for six months, and showed no signs of budging from its position. The contest now promised to be a long one ; till the Government discovered an artifice by which to resume payments. There was a provision in the Audit Act which directed the Governor to sign the necessary warrants for the payment of such sums as were awarded by a verdict of the Supreme Court to persons who had sued the Government. In such cases no appropriation by Parliament was needed. The intention of this clause was, that it should not be possible for the Government to defeat a verdict of the court by failing to carry the necessary appropriation in Parliament ; nor could it have recourse to Parliament as to a higher tribunal for the purpose of practically reversing the judgment of the law courts. It was a wise provision for its purpose ; under it, the Treasurer was imperatively bound to pay, and the verdict of the Court was a full and sufficient warrant to the Governor for the issue of the proper documents. The Government now utilised this enactment in a way never contemplated by its originators. They applied to the six associated banks for a cash credit. After long negotiations five of them refused ; but the London Chartered Bank made an advance of \u00a3\"40,000. This not being Treasury money, but money lent to the Government, the Treasurer proceeded to pay it away to meet the most pressing liabilities. The bank then instituted an action in the Supreme Court for the recovery of its money. The Government duly appeared by means of counsel, but made no defence. Judgment being confessed, the Court had no alternative but to give a verdict; armed with which the bank applied to the Treasury, and received its money ; only to place it again at the service of the Government as a cash credit, to be operated against in precisely the same manner. So the public payments were resumed, and the business of the country went forward as before. The Council was checkmated. Haines moved in it that a petition be presented to the Queen, setting forth the facts, and requesting her to maintain the constitution of the colony. Henry Miller objected that the Queen could not legally interfere, except by recalling the Governor for permitting the recent action of the Ministry, which had been carried on in his name\u2014 a result which he would personally regret. Fawkner delivered one of his declamatory addresses, asserting that the next proceeding of the Ministry would be to sever the country from the empire, and ruin it. Fellows, who was a stout freetrader, and had resigned his position in the Ministry during the preceding year, maintained that the country had not yet had a chance of declaring its opinion in regard to protection, but that if the issue were placed fairly before the electors, unbiassed by side questions, and if the judgment were given decidedly against the Council, he apprehended that that body would yield. Sladen supported the motion to send a petition to the Queen. If it resulted in the recall"], [447, "PROTECTLON TO NATIVE INDUSTRY- 1S60 TO 1866. 425 of Sir Charles Darling, that was no more than was deserved by a Governor who took sides in a contest, and lent his influence as a partisan of the Ministry. The motion was carried by a majority of seventeen to six. The petition was drawn up, setting forth the course of events, and accusing the Governor of having disregarded, if not abused, the constitution of the colony by giving his sanction to the practices carried out in collusion with the London Chartered Bank. The Assembly replied by passing a vote of thanks to the Governor for his action. In the discussion upon this point, Graham Berry opposed the Government. He said he regretted that strategy had been adopted ; that the letter of the constitution had been employed in express contradiction of its spirit ; and that he would have preferred all public payments to have ceased for even a year, if necessary, rather than that there should be substituted for a shoit sharp crisis one so long and lingering as he now saw before the country. Meantime the feelings of the people continued to be expressed more forcibly than ever. Vale having resigned in order to test the mind of Ballarat West, was opposed by James Service, who had just returned from a three years' visit to Europe. The question was one purely of protection or free-trade, and Vale, the protectionist candidate, secured the seat by a considerable majority. But the popular enthusiasm was more evident in the great mass meetings. Night after night the market-places and vacant allotments were thronged with crowds, mostly of men. The flickering oil-lamps spread ' their yellow light and their trails of smoke round some empty cart, or some deserted fruit-stall, whereon the peoples' heroes held forth till their throats were aching. And when they had passed their resolutions approving of the attitude of the Ministry, they adopted addresses to the Governor, thanking him for assisting the people in the attainment of their wishes. Addresses of this sort poured in from all the suburbs of Melbourne ; from Geelong, Ballarat, Sandhurst, Kyneton, and all the most important towns ; nowhere but at Maryborough was any counter demonstration attempted. But in Melbourne the Free-trade League prepared a petition for the Queen, setting forth the misdeeds of the Government and of the Governor. It lay in shops, and on stalls by the street-gutters, and had thousands upon thousands of signatures. The noisiest of all the meetings was that at Collingwood, called to demand from Graham Berry an explanation of his recent action. He was received with marks of extreme disapprobation ; but explained that he was bound to assert his opinion, that in straining the Audit Act as they were doing the Ministry were proceeding in a course that was illegal and unjustifiable. When he mentioned the name of Higinbotham, repeated cheers rang through the place ; when he stated that he declined to support the Ministry in their present position, fierce cries of \" turncoat and traitor \" were hurled at him. He lost his temper, and shouted out that \" he would not stand the tyranny of howling idiots.\" Heales moved that \" the meeting condemns the course pursued by Mr. Berry, and that if he feels it inconsistent on his part to support the Government, it requests him to at once resign his seat.\" The motion was carried unanimously. Another stormy discussion was held in two detachments. The freetraders had called a meeting in St. George's Hall ; admission was to be by ticket. The hall was well filled, but about four thousand protectionists gathered at the doors, who were refused admittance ; and these formed outside the hall, and were addressed by speakers from the first-floor windows of the shops. Inside the hall Mr. Bunny, a barrister, moved, and Murray Smith seconded, a motion that the proceedings of the Government were unconstitutional and illegal. This was passed, and so was another, moved by Mr. Holroyd, that the meeting approved of the dignified stand made by the Council. The petition then being prepared to the Queen was"], [448, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 426 read and unanimously approved. Meanwhile, outside the hall, resolutions were passed as unanimously, that what was done within was of no value ; and that any resolutions sent home by that meeting to the British Government would be mere frauds, as they did not represent the feelings of the country. Similar agitations were repeated in every variety of form all through the colony, and the Governor still continued to receive memorials thanking him for his action. In reply to one, he said he was glad to find that the people approved of his action, which he believed to have saved the colony from much confusion and distress. He considered that not much more than one-eighth part of the adult male population really condemned the course he had taken ; he was confident that he was in accord with the wishes of the great bulk of the community. There was at this time some talk of the indignity done to the Council by never allowing it the chance of passing the Tariff Bill before the device of tacking was adopted. It was said in different quarters that the Council would not be unwilling to pass it, if it were sent up in the ordinary manner. Thereupon, Verdon re-introduced the Tariff Bill in the Assembly, explaining that the Appropriation Bill, in its usual form, would be kept back until the Council had agreed to the Tariff Bill, so that in reality the Assembly would lose none of the advantage it possessed. The Tariff Bill was passed by thirty-nine votes to fourteen. It was taken to the Council, where it was without material discussion rejected by nineteen votes to five. A week later, McCulloch announced that the Assembly would be dissolved at an early date, so that in the general elections a decisive verdict might be given by the people. However, no Appropriation Bill would be sent up until the Tariff Bill became law. The Council passed a resolution warning the Governor of the probable consequences of a dissolution of Parliament, while as yet no Appropiation Bill was passed. But Sir Charles in no way hesitated; on the nth of December he dissolved the House. The election campaign had even then been commenced, and it promised to be the fiercest contest the colony had ever seen. All the members of the Government were well received, and duly returned. Higinbotham, though still announcing free-trade views, was none the less popular, for he declared that he would maintain with all his power the right of the people to determine the amount and form of the taxation to which they were to be subject. Some of the prominent opponents of the Ministry withdrew from the contest. O'Shanassy bade farewell to his constituents of Kilmore, pleading ill-health as the cause, but undoubtedly he was in the main influenced by the improbability of there being any adequate opposition to the Government in the new Parliament. And on the 3rd of February, when the elections were all over, his augury was more than fully justified. Out of a House of seventy-eight members, fifty-eight were supporters of the Ministry; only twenty were independent or in opposition. During the heat of the conflict, a despatch arrived from the Colonial Office which gave some encouragement to the Council. In it Mr. Cardwell, the Secretary for the Colonies, expressed the censure with which the authorities in England viewed the action of the Victorian Government in collecting duties on the vote of one House alone, without waiting for the legal completion of the measure. Strengthened by the promise of Imperial support thus indicated, the Council girt itself to renew the struggle. The old Tariff Bill was again sent up to it, and in spite of the strongly pronounced opinion of the people, it was again thrown out by a majority of twenty to eight. McCulloch then resigned, and so cast on the Council the responsibility of managing the affairs of the country. The Governor invited Fellows to form a ministry, but such a task was impossible."], [449, "PROTECTION TO NATIVE INDUSTRY.\u2014 1660 TO 1866. 427 No cabinet could govern the country which was not supported by a majority of the Assembly, and that body, to show the resoluteness of its opinion, expressly passed a motion that it would \" withhold its confidence from any administration that shall refuse or neglect to adopt the tariff already submitted.\" The moving of the resolution occasioned a stormy sitting, which lasted all night, the fifteen who were opposed to McCulloch moving an adjournment time after time, and not till half-past eight in the morning were they wearied out, and the resolution carried. Fellows being unable to form a ministry, McCulloch returned to office. He immediately suspended the arrangement with the London Chartered Bank, by which the Ministry had been enabled to continue payments for the last eight months. Various reasons were assigned for the change, but in all probability it was out of deference to the Governor, who had been severely rebuked by the Colonial Office in London. Mr. Cardwell had in strong language referred to his \"continued violation of the law,\" and directed him to desist \"from those manifestly unlawful proceedings by which one political party seeks to establish its preponderance over another.\" In order, therefore, to relieve the Governor from the embarrassment and loss he might otherwise suffer, McCulloch again suspended payments, being well aware that the Council must shortly surrender; and so in effect it did. In April a committee was appointed by eace body to form a conference. It was agreed that certain alterations of detail should be made in the Tariff Bill, and that then the Council should adopt it. This was done. The bill was passed through its three readings in the Council without discussion, and the first deadlock was over. Payments were resumed at the Treasury, and the new protective duties began again to be levied at the Customs House. All things would now have gone well but for the arrival of a missive from London recalling Sir Charles Darling. Popular seeling again flared up. A meeting of five thousand persons in the Eastern Market passed a resolution expressing regret at the recall of the Governor, and pledging itself to memorialise the Queen in his favour. Strong language was used. One speaker made significant references to America and independence, but his words were listened to without the cheers that had greeted previous speakers. William Don was better received in his contemptuous allusions to the petty prejudices of a \" few inhabitants of Downing-street.\" Another great meeting of four or five thousand people in Queen-street depre cated \" the unnecessary interference of Her Majesty's Secretary of State in our internal affairs,\" and asserted that Governor Darling's course was entirely in accordance with the wish of the people. Between thirty and forty distinct places held meetings for the same purpose, and sent memorials in favour of the Governor for transmission to the Queen. Sir Charles sent a minute to both Houses announcing his dismissal from his office. He justified his policy, and stated that not only did he act under the advice of his responsible ministers throughout, but he had taken indepen dent legal opinion, by which he was assured that his action had been in all respects well within the sanction of the law. He asserted that his recall was due to a conspiracy of twenty-two members of his Executive Council, who had secretly despatched a petition against him to the Colonial Office, wilfully suppressing facts, and misrepresenting his attitude in the contest. But there was no help for it. He must go ; though only two and a-half years of his term of office were run. The 7th of May 1S66 was the day appointed for his departure, and never has Melbourne witnessed so great a popular enthusiasm. In the early part of the forenoon a meeting of 2000 working men gathered between the Model Schools and the"], [450, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 428 Parliament building, to draw up a memorial expressing a respectful farewell. At noon Sir Charles arrived at the Treasury. All Spring-street and all Collins-street were densely black with the crowds. As the Governor's carriage drove up, a lane was opened in the mass of people, amid tumultuous cheering. Within the building he bade farewell to the members of Parliament and the chief officers of public departments. On resuming his place in his carriage, and turning down Collins-street, he was joined by the trades' societies, who formed a procession. With banners flying, they moved forward in a long line, behind which the vast crowd closed in, and marched in dense array. At the Prince's Bridge a triumphal arch had been erected, with the words \" Honour to the Just.\" Here the horses were taken out of the carriage, and the Governor and his lady were drawn along the Sandridge-road, with long lines of loudly-cheering artisans tugging at the shafts and ropes. At the foot of Clarendon-street, the people of Emerald Hill had more arches, with mottoes wishing Sir Charles \" Justice, Prosperity, and Happiness.\" The crowd must have stretched in a long procession some three or four miles, for when the Governor alighted on Sandridge pier, the tail of the line was not yet over Prince's Bridge. Before the departing family took their places in the barge, the great crowd had again collected, some sixty thousand in number ; almost all of them workmen in their holiday attire. For all classes of artisans had left their various crafts to see the Governor depart who was suffering in the people's cause. Along all the beach ; upon all the wharves ; on the decks of the vessels ; up the sloping sand-hills ; back to the line of shops that fronted the sea \u2014 the great crowd, enthusiastic but orderly, raised one vast roar of prolonged cheering as the boat pushed off with the popular hero of the hour. SIR CHARLES DARLING."], [451, "A POLITICAL MEETING IN THE OLD EASTERN MARKET CHAPTER XXII XTbe Beabloch.\u2014 1866 to 1869 f MIDST all the agitation of political factions, the country had never ceased to make steady progress. The population was advancing year by year, and was nearing a total of three-quarters of a million, while every industry showed a satisfactory improvement. The effects of protection began to make themselves felt in the immediate growth of all the clothing industries, including the manufactures of boots and shoes ; but already there were evidences that the body-politic is as difficult to prescribe for as our individual bodies ; the medicine that cures one disease is apt to interfere disastrously with organs that would otherwise have been healthy. The Ballarat Farmers' League held a large meeting, at which a vote of thanks to the Ministry was passed, but a resolution was also adopted reminding it that the agricultural interests had all along expected the imposition of a duty upon cereals. Similar resolutions were passed by the Geelong Farmers' League ; and so, one after another, all through the country, the farmers now indicated their expectation of being repaid for their zealous votes on behalf of the artisan interests. Meantime deputations began to wait on the Commissioner of Customs urging conflicting claims. The tanner was not quite satisfied with the duty upon leather ; it ought to be increased. The saddler was quite satisfied with the duty on saddles, but wanted the duty on leather to be wholly remitted. The hat manufacturers and the clothiers desired all duties to be removed from the materials out of which they made their goods. The makers of these materials were indignant at the lamentable falling-off thus shown from those heaven-sent principles of protection which they had all agreed to support. And so, in a score of ways, industrial derangements began to be seen, which people in their hurry had previously not foreseen. A mild duty on cereals was proposed in order to satisfy the farmer; it was adopted in the Assembly; but only by a very small majority. The larger proportion of that body were devoted to the interests of the artisans; for when the labouring classes of Victoria voted, they followed the lead"], [452, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 430 of the active, plausible, and resolute mechanic of the cities, who raised the issues, uttered the party cries, and secured a vast body of support for a policy that was, in the immediate present, to benefit himself and himself alone. And this Assembly, which certainly represented the wishes of the people, strong in the enthusiasm of popular feeling, was resolved to be the dominant power in the State. There might be a Governor, there might be a Council, but the will of the people must be supreme, and the will of the people was the will of its Assembly. The popular cry at that time asked what the Council was that it should withstand the plainly-spoken determination of the nation. It was returned by 9000 voters\u2014 a mere handful of the people ; but even that did not indicate to the full how clearly it was oligarchic in its constitution. No close borough in the days before the Reform Bill in England could have been more the monopoly of a few than some of the electorates of the Upper House at that time in Victoria. In one district, which contained 20,000 electors for the Assembly, there were only nine who had a vote for the Council. The bulk of the people there were struggling farmers, and only nine of them were possessed of \u00a3\"1000 worth of real estate, and these nine could, by their votes in the Council, neutralise the votes of the 20,000 in the Assembly. Hence the cry began to be heard, deep and ominous, \" Reform the Council.\" The friends of liberal politics had up to this time uniformly supported the Assembly. even though many were free-traders, their opinion being that, in a country with free institutions, the will of the people, however erroneous, if clearly and deliberately expressed, ought to be carried into effect. Now, however, the support of many was alienated by the somewhat truculent action of the Assembly itself. The popular party had for a time been very indignant with the Argus. That journal had been immensely in savour in 1854, when it strenuously advocated the views of the diggers ; and, when its allusions to the Queen, the nobility, and the rule of wealth had been more or less contemptuous. But its management had altered; it was now under different editorial supervision, and its business affairs were directed by Hugh George, perhaps the ablest man for such a position whom Australia has produced. The Argus had assumed decided free-trade views, and maintained consistently that a policy of protection was a policy of commercial suicide. The Age, founded in 1854, had adopted the cause of protection ; at first with little decision in its tone. The topic was a new one ; the theory was supposed to be exploded. Scientific writers regarded it as a superstition relegated to the unreturning past. Only step by step did it adopt the new idea, but by the popular fervour it was carried in two years far beyond what any one had at first contemplated, if we may judge by the tone of its articles in 1864. The two newspapers had begun by taking a dispassionate view of the situation, the Argus being not disinclined to allow some advantages to protection, the Age being only anxious to try it as an experiment, and not at all prepared to guarantee it as an infallible success. However, in the midst of party warfare, sides were more and more decidedly taken. The Argus took up the free-trade position more and more uncompromisingly ; the Age, finding that it was giving voice to the large, vague, formless wish of the multitude, made that voice grow more and more articulate, till it found itself the oracle of the working classes, and a power in the land. Neither paper was sparing of its adjectives in reference to opponents ; and in one of its leaders the Argus had said that a speech of McCulloch's, on 15th March 1886, had \"fairly bristled with falsehood, and formed a fitting denouement to the career of a Cabinet which has been marked, with little variation, by deceit, chicane, and lawlessness.\" These are"], [453, "THE DEADLOCK.-1866 TO 1860. 431 strong words, evoked by the heat of conflict, words such as the writer might perhaps have been inclined to laugh at, some years afterwards, as having been struck out in a fiery time without any real foundation of bitterness. But next day McCulloch moved in the Assembly that the publication of such words was a breach of privilege. Gillies opposed him, and said that in a perfectly public matter, everyone had a right to express his opinion ; but the House carried the motion of McCulloch by 40 to 19. McCulloch then moved \"That Mr. Hugh George be called to the bar of this House on Tuesday next.\" This also was carried, and Mr. George duly appeared on the 20th March. He said that the remarks printed made no reflection on the private honour of the Premier ; but that the conduct of the Ministry, so far as the public had reason to judge, seemed to the writer to merit the description he had given of it. Mr. Higinbotham George refused to pay the fees, and assured the messenger that he was perfectly happy. The Parliamentary refresh ment-room he con sidered to be singularly well supplied with all manner of good things ; his friends and him self were well pleased with the hospitality they had experienced. On 10th April, Par liament was prorogued ; and the Sergeant, seeing plenty of expense and no fees in the suture, quietly let the prisoner go, and both Assembly and Government were glad to see him gone from the place without further trouble. then moved that Mr. Hugh George be com- mitted to the custody of the Sergeant -at -Arms, which was at once car- ried. Mr. George was detained in a room at the House of Parlia- ment, but was suffered to pursue his ordinary avocations, and to see his friends. He ex- pressed himself as being perfectly happy, and enjoying a comfortable time. A week later McCulloch moved that he be discharged on payment of the Ser geant's fees, which would amount to about one hundred pounds. This also was carried, but Mr. GEORGE HIGINBOTHAM. (Present Chief Justice of Victoria.) But ere the prorogation of that Parliament, a new quarrel had sprung up, which led to what is known as pre-eminently the deadlock of Victoria. During the week preceding the departure of Sir Charles Darling, the question of his recall was referred to in the Assembly ; many expressions of regret were employed by members that the Governor should have suffered through the determination of the Ministry to carry out their policy in the only way that had been open to them. One member proposed a vote of money to compensate him, but it was pointed out that to pay him money would be a distinct defiance of the Colonial Office which condemned him. Higinbotham declared that the Government of this colony was not dependent on the Colonial Office, nor in any way responsible to it. Its allegiance was to the people of the colony, and to them alone. If the people desired that the Governor should not suffer in their cause, it was the duty of the Ministry to make at least the effort to satisfy their wishes. Vol. 1 3D"], [454, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLLS: PAST AND PRESENT. 432 In a desultory way it was suggested that a sum of twenty thousand pounds ' should be voted. But it was objected that one of the paragraphs in the Governor's instructions forbade him to receive any gratuity whatsoever from the people he was sent to govern. A committee, however, was appointed to examine the whole matter with care, and report to the House. It was very generally felt, now that the various despatches of the Governor were published, that he had been indiscreet. In one of them he stated that the opposition to protection in the colony arose mainly from the fact that the new duties, for the first time, would touch the pockets of a large and wealthy class of importers. This imputation of motives was a most unwise proceed ing on the part of one whose fundamental duty was to be impartial ; and other expressions used by Sir Charles showed that he was unconsciously assuming a position of hostility to the wealthier classes of the community. Mr. Cardwell saw in this a sufficient reason for his recall, and many of the democratic party were willing enough to agree that there was some ground for such a decision; but at the same time the general feeling was clear, that if the colony carried its point and obtained success in its policy, while leaving another to suffer for its sake, it would be playing a mean and ungenerous part. The committee therefore recommended that an address should be presented to Sir Charles, assuring him of the gratitude of the colony for having saved it from anarchy at a critical time, when the most serious results might have been expected from the temper of a people who were being persistently thwarted in their wishes, and that a sum of twenty thousand pounds be presented to Lady Darling. At the same sitting of the Assembly, at which the report of this select committee was brought up, there was read a letter from Sir Charles, written on the day previous to his departure, stating that no member of his family could receive the bounty of the Parliament and people of Victoria until the Queen should have signified her pleasure in regard to the matter. Accordingly, the Assembly voted an address to Her Majesty, asking her to sanction the proposed gift to Lady Darling. All this had been accompanied by agitation among the public, and a torchlight demonstration in favour of the Ministry was one of the novelties introduced. But at length the petition to the Queen was despatched, and further action was suspeqded till a reply should come. The political storms then lulled in the intervening months. On the departure of Sir Charles Darling, the administration of the Government had been assumed by General Carey, the commandant of the forces. Three months later the new Governor arrived, Sir John H. T. Manners-Sutton, who assumed office on the 15th of August, 1866. He had been Governor of Trinidad, and was of sufficient experience to be more circumspect than Darling had been. General Carey had prorogued Parliament on the 1st of June preceding. There was no necessity for its reassembling till the beginning of the following year, and so the new Governor had some months of quietness in which to prepare for the troubled times ahead. On the 19th of January 1867 both Houses of Parliament met once more. The political weather looked black and cloudy, several distinct issues looming in front, each charged with storm, each involving a quarrel between the Council and the Assembly. First of all there was this matter of the grant to Lady Darling\u2014 a comparatively small affair, but surrounded by contentious feeling. The contest was opened on 19th February by the receipt of a despatch from the Colonial Office in reply to the petition of the Assembly. Some delay had taken place in England. The Ministry in which Mr. Cardwell was Colonial Secretary had stumbled and fallen. Lord John Russell and Mr. Gladstone had sailed to carry their schemes of reform, and had given place to Earl Derby, in whose Cabinet Lord Carnarvon was Secretary for the"], [455, "THE DEADLOCK.-1S66 TO 1869. 433 Colonies ; while Disraeli, Stanley, and Northcote held others of the prominent offices. But they, too, were face to face with a strong democratic feeling in England, which would not suffer a Conservative party that had shelved the question of Parliamentary reform to carry out its operations in peace. Hence Lord Carnarvon did not reply to the address of the Assembly till towards the end of the year. Pie stated that he had been unable to advise Her Majesty to accede to the request that had been made. The rule was explicit, he said, that no Governor was to receive any gratuity from the inhabitants of the colony over which he was sent to preside. Such a rule he considered salutary ; but it would have no effect if it was permitted that a present should be made to a Governor's wife. Sir Charles Darling had been informed that the acceptance of the proposed gift by Lady Darling would be equivalent to his retirement from Her Majesty's service. The Government could not proceed with the proposed vote in the face of this despatch without learning the mind of Sir Charles. A communication was sent to him, and a reply was received at the end of July that Sir Charles elected to receive the \u00a320,000, and relinquish Her Majesty's colonial service. On the 26th of that month the Government placed on the supplementary estimates the sum of \u00a3\"20,000 as a grant to Lady Darling. The discussion began on 1st August; the proposed grant was found to be a clause of the Appropriation Bill. Ireland, Aspinall, and Gillies opposed the grant, and especially deprecated its appearance in an Appropration Bill, which they said was only an ungenerous trick to prevent the Council from having a voice in the matter. It was only courting another deadlock. Higinbotham replied that it was absolutely certain that the council would reject the grant if sent up alone, and that the will of the people must be carried into effect by this expedient, which was perfectly constitutional, and which, moreover, was perfectly equitable if the Assembly was to retain, as it ought to do, the sole control of financial matters. The clause, as it appeared in the Appropriation Bill, was carried by a majority of forty-two to fifteen. It was sent up to the Council in due course. At the second reading on 20th August Fellows moved that it be rejected. The grant it provided for Lady Darling was unconstitutional, and would form a precedent for corrupt practices, inasmuch as it was a reward given by one branch of the Legislature to a second for assisting to gag the third. Sladcn seconded the motion, T. T. aBeckett opposed it. He thought the question one of purely financial importance, and as such it might as well be left entirely at the discretion of the Assembly. Besides, he considered that there was no great harm in recompensing Sir Charles for a loss he had sustained in complying with the wishes of the colony. But Sladen hotly answered that if Sir Charles took the money, it would be an eternal disgrace to his name that he had sold his allegiance to his Queen for \u00a320,000. Discussion was useless, however. The members well knew how they intended to vote, and the Appropriation Bill was thrown out by a majority of twenty-three to six. Here was another deadlock. McCulloch had now once more to face the problem of carrying on the government of the country without funds. He tendered advice to the Governor, indicating a method of obtaining supplies for a time; but Manners-Sutton was not to be implicated so easily as Darling had been. And, besides, his sympathies, so far as they could be guessed, were altogether with the Council and those who now began to be called the Constitutional party. He refused to adopt the course suggested, and McCulloch resigned. He knew very well that he was master of the situation, and the Governor likewise knew it. After a week of deliberation he declined to accept McCulloch's resignation, stating that the formation of a new Government, strong in the Council, but weak in the Assembly, could be no improvement upon one that was strong"], [456, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT 434 in the Assembly and weak in the Council. Indeed, he thought it would be the reverse. He could not receive McCulloch's resignation, but he would consent to a dissolution and another appeal to the country if he had assurances from both sides that they would accept the decision of the country as final, and adjust their differences in accordance with it. Fellows would give no such assurance, and, at the Governor's request, McCulloch resumed office. He resolved to move for a temporary supply sufficient to carry on the Government for a month or so ; then to prorogue the House, and, calling a new session a day or two afterwards, to re-introduce the Appropriation Bill in the Council, in the hopes that possibly that body, seeing how hopeless it was that it could govern the country, would relax its opposition and allow the bill to pass. This was one of those junctures at which the voice of the people, as heard in public meetings, is likely to have weight. It was speedily uttered in assistance of the Ministry. Melbourne was the first to move. St. George's Hall, once more, was packed by an orderly but enthusiastic crowd, armed with a liberal equipment of sticks and other instru ments of tumultuous applause. James Balfour declared that the whole heart of the people approved of the Darling grant, and ringing cheers greeted the assertion. The people desired it, and they alone, by the voice of the Assembly, had the right to determine what they were to do with their money. Murray Smith re plied that the Council, as a second Chamber, was created for the sole purpose of re vising and reviewing the popular wishes in order that hasty and ill-advised legis lation should be avoided ; and that if it had done less than it had done it would have signally failed in its duty. But a vast majority carried a motion approving of the Darling grant, and tendering to the Government the thanks of the meeting. In most of the suburbs and many of the country towns, meet ings were held to support McCulloch's action. Rich mond, Collingwood, North cote, Preston, Emerald Hill, Brunswick, Prahran, Bunin yong, Castlemaine, Sand hurst, Ballarat, and a score of other places sent their resolutions of confidence. THOMAS HOWARD FELLOWS Thus supported, the Ministry resolved to go forward with its scheme of temporary supply. On 29th August Verdon introduced a bill for the withdrawal of \u00a3\"300,000 out of the consolidated revenue, for the purpose of paying the civil servants and meeting the immediate liabilities of the state. Gavan Duffy invited the Government to give an assurance that the \u00a320,000 would not be paid out of the moneys so advanced, otherwise the Council would naturally decline to sanction this temporary supply. Verdon gave that assurance on behalf of his colleagues, and the bill was duly passed. When it reached the Council, however, the terms of the preamble seemed to that body to tacitly claim for the Assembly the absolute, and, practically, the sole authority in matters of finance. The Council maintained its right of veto even in financial matters, and would not pass the bill with a preamble so worded. It appointed, however, a select committee to confer with a committee of the Assembly, should one be appointed, in order that a compromise might be effected in regard to the obnoxious preamble. The Assembly agreed to the conference, but nothing came of it, and a long and dreary suspension of public"], [457, "THE DEADLOCK\u2014 1866 TO i86g. 435 payments seemed to be imminent. The Government notified in the Gazette its deep sense of the inconvenience to which public creditors were subjected, and promised that money due to them would be made payable at the Treasury on the morning after the temporary Supply Bill should be duly passed into law. The Council gave way. It was only a small matter that was in dispute with regard to this temporary bill. The Assembly referred to itself as having \"granted\" a certain sum of money. The Council maintained that the word should have been \"voted,\" inasmuch as the Assembly could not grant by itself, but could only record its vote as one of the three co-ordinate branches of the Legislature. The Council waived the point in view of public inconvenience. It passed the Supply Bill with a notification that it regarded the preamble as being out of strict constitutional form, and also that the bill was passed in full reliance on the promise that the grant to Lady Darling would not be paid by the Government out of moneys so allowed. And so a stormy session came to an end ; Parliament being prorogued on the 10th September. This session had witnessed another phase of the question of payment of members. Ambrose Kyte had come forward as a champion of that measure ; he initiated a new discussion of it during January in 1862, immediately after the opening of the session. Again it received the support of the Assembly, the majority being nearly three to one ; the general feeling was that, in a country situated as Victoria then was the payment of its members of Parliament was a necessary supplement to representative institutions, and that without it universal suffrage was more nominal than real. By four to one the Assembly fixed \u00a3500 a-year as the rate of payment for members of both Houses, but, by fifteen votes to eleven, it passed a self denying ordinance, according to which members of the existing House were to be excluded from the benefit of that measure. Its provisions were to take effect only after the election of a new Assembly. This stage was not reached till the 9th of July. The Council did not discuss the matter till the early part of September, and on the 4th of that month it again rejected the bill after a very short and merely formal debate. This was only three days after the resignation of McCulloch, in consequence of the rejection of the Appropriation Bill. The two circumstances were conjoined in the popular mind, and the condition of affairs had all the appearance of a general struggle for mastery between the two Houses. Hence there began to rise a widespread demand for a reform of the Legislative Council, and it seemed not unlikely that if the immediate causes of dispute should be settled there would still remain a battle to be fought on this fundamental point. On 1 8th September, after only eight days' recess, Parliament was called together again. The Governor then took upon himself the responsibility of recommending the Council to pass the Appropriation Bill containing the Darling grant, on the ground that, as Sir Charles Darling had withdrawn from the colonial service in expectation of receiving that sum, it would be as well to pay him the money, and put an end to the quarrel. On 9th October the Council, by twenty votes against five, rejected that advice, but intimated that they would consider the proposal on its merits if sent up in a separate form ; they would not consider it at all if inserted in the Appropriation Bill. The Governor then urged upon the Ministry the desirability of complying with this demand. They complied, but with some misgivings. Verdon introduced a separate bill for the supply of \u00a320,000 as a grant to Lady Darling, but the Assembly would not permit it to pass in that form. It must go into the Appropriation Bill, they said, or else a precedent"], [458, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT 436 would be established, and it might be taken for granted in future that the process of tacking had been proven to be unconstitutional. Thus the Assembly might lose its power, and the people their sovereign control. The vote was agreed to by thirty-nine to thirteen, and ordered to be placed in the Appropriation Bill. On 16th October the Council again summarily rejected the Appropriation Bill by a majority of twenty to five. The crisis was therefore come, and the Governor could see no other course possible than a dissolution, and another appeal to the feeling of the country. But before the dismissal of Parliament it was necessary to provide for supplies in the interval. Verdon brought in a bill for temporary supply amounting to \u00a3500,000. The Council rejected it because it did not disclose the manner in which the money was to be applied, and there was no guarantee but that it might be employed in paying the obnoxious grant. Parliament was immediately afterwards prorogued, on 8th November, and the country had to look forward to a period of four or five months without money for its necessary services. This deadlock seemed likely to be worse than the former, for the Governor could now give no sanction to any arrangement with any bank, such as had previously provided a way out of the difficulty. But the Ministry saw that there was really no necessity for the intervention of a bank. If a bank could sue for its money in the Supreme Court and get it, so could an individual. The Ministry gave notice that suits brought by persons employed in the public service would not be defended. Thousands of persons took the hint, brought their suits, obtained judgment, and with that as their warrant, drew their money out of the Treasury. The Governor looked with some alarm on this process, but he was forced to allow that to some extent it would be necessary in order to prevent more serious consequences. He warned the Government, however, to confine the practice only to the payment of those services that were necessary to the protection of life and property, or for the prevention of dangerous confusion. And so the members of both Houses returned to their homes. The public service was carried on by means of this expedient, and the matter in dispute still lay unsettled, and with an unknown future before it. Immediately afterwards there came a little interlude; the colony that had so long found its chief interest in political conflict, now forgot everything in the festivities, the excitement, the enthusiasm that attended the visit of the Queen's second son Prince Alfred. He had not long before reached his majority, and had been created Duke of Edinburgh. He had been in the royal navy since he was fourteen years of age, and now was in command of H. M.S. Galatea. The Queen had desired that he should see something of foreign lands, and the Admiralty had fitted out an expedition to accompany him in a voyage round the world. It was a novelty for the Australian colonies to see a member of the Royal Family. There was throughout them all a widespread feeling of devotion to the motherland and its Queen. It was perhaps a stronger feeling than the loyalty that pervades the masses in older countries ; for to thousands upon thousands in the colony England and her Queen were the fond associations of youth to which they ever turned with affection ; and very few there were, who though making their homes in the colony did not dream of a trip to Europe, and a renewal of old delights. Their devotion to the Queen therefore had something of an exile's fervour, and as Prince Alfred was the first of royal blood to touch Australian soil, it was resolved that his welcome should be such as would befit the novelty of the occasion. On the 21st of November 1867 it was telegraphed from Queenscliff that the Galatea was nearing the Heads. The Government steamer Victoria was despatched to go out and meet her, and on that day the whole of Melbourne was astir to be in readiness for all the gaiety"], [459, "THE DEADLOCK\u2014 1860 TO 1869. 437 that she intended to display. Flagstaffs were rising, arches were steadily assuming all the grandeur that was to be, scaffoldings still showed where extensive preparations were going forward on a costly scale. On the 23rd a fleet of twenty-five steamers carrying about nine thousand people left the wharves at Sandridge to meet the Galatea half way down the bay. The Prince had already begun the receipt of addresses; the first of that mighty deluge which was coming was the work of the people of Queenscliff, who caught him off the quarantine ground, and administered the first mild dose. The public entry into Melbourne did not take place till two days later. Melbourne never was, and never has been, so gay. Those least likely to be infected by the peculiar contagion of demonstrative loyalty, could scarcely avoid a strange exaltation of feeling in the midst of so wide a scene of floating colour ; flags and banners and festoons ; arches of gorgeous THE \" GALATEA\" IN HOliSON'S BAY. tints, and arches of evergreens ; everything that enthusiasm and ingenuity could devise was there to make the place look festive ; every balcony and every verandah contributed its brightness to the general effect. Sandridge pier and all the surroundings were densely crowded, as a young gentleman in an ordinary tweed suit stepped ashore from a simple barge. It was a moment or two before the crowd realised that it was the son of their much honoured Queen ; then from ten thousand throats a cheer went up that could be heard for miles away. The crowd fell in behind the carriages, and marched back to town along the Sandridge road, cheering at the smallest and most innocent provocation. On the next day, Tuesday, the Prince held a great levee in the Exhibition building, behind the Public Library, and at night the city was given over to fireworks and illuminations. What with gaslight, and coloured lanterns, and interminable rockets, Melbourne was brilliant beyond all precedent, the Fitzroy gardens being especially admired for the magnificence of their illumination. On Wednesday"], [460, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 438 evening the Governor gave a grand ball, and several thousands of citizens, in whirling to the strains of Zeplin's band, found some relief to their pent-up feelings of enthusiasm. Vast crowds for the next few days waited in the streets to see the Prince as he traversed the city; 10,000 schoolchildren were gathered to sing their songs of welcome. But chief of all the items on the programme of the Reception Ccmmittee was the Free Banquet provided in the park beside the banks of the Yarra. Sixty tons of provisions were supplied, and two great vats of wine 500 gallons apiece. It was announced that the banquet was to begin at one o'clock. Some 20,000 guests had been expected ; the ccmmittee having in view enly the poorer classes. But that was not generally understood. It was regarded as the people's banquet at which the people were to feast, and to drink a toast to the son of their Queen. Sixty thousand people appeared, large numbers no doubt out of mere curiosity, the day being a public holiday. There were 250 policemen on the ground, but these were quite insufficient to secure the prevalence ot system and order. Two o'clock came, the vast crowd having stood in good-humoured expectation for an hour, but the Prince did not appear. A disagreeable duststorm began to blow overhead, making the thirst of those densely packed in the suffocating heat quite equal to their hunger which was now beginning to be a motive power. At half-past two some of the rougher classes in the crowd seeing no sign of the Prince as yet, burst through the barriers, and cleared the nearest tables. A great commotion began, and some 20,000 of the spectators left the ground and returned to their homes. The remainder stayed on in expectation of their banquet. At three o'clock the committee hoisted the flag as a signal to begin, and a slight commencement was made, when the news arrived that the Prince was approaching to open the banquet ; the flag was hauled down ; proceedings ceased. The crowd did not understand; it became unruly. A number of ill-mannered fellows turned on the wine, and a scramble ensued for a share. Then came word that the Prince had been advised not to appear, and that he had withdrawn. The flag was again hoisted, but all semblance of order was gone. The provisions were demolished by those who were able to seize them, a great deal was trampled under foot ; a few tipsy fellows let the wine flow in gutters ; or poured it over one another in bucketsful in their drunken frolics. The great mass of the people departed in disgust, abandoning the place to some riotous hundreds whom the police expelled ; and so came to an ignominious end the great democratic banquet, \u2014 the people's festival in honour of the Prince. But others much more successful were given in all the asylums and in some of the hospitals in commemoration of the Prince's visit. On the Friday following his arrival, he laid the foundation-stone of a new town hall The city had grown too important and too wealthy to be content with the plain and humble-looking bluestone building at the corner of Collins and Swanston streets. Designs had been drawn for the fine new structure, which is now an ornament to the city. At four o'clock on a spring afternoon, the space to be occupied by the proposed building was filled by a dense crowd ; raised on temporary galleries there sat tier on tier of ladies. Mr. Butters, as mayor, delivered a speech, reminding the great concourse that the spot where they then were gathered, the centre of a city of one hundred and forty thousand inhabitants, had been just thirty years before a sylvan nook in the midst of a lonely forest. Mr. Fitzgibbon, the town clerk, read a loyal address ; the Prince read a short reply, and then the stone was laid amid the most thunderous applause. In the evening a great civic banquet was held at the Exhibition building, and as the Prince on its conclusion descended the steps in front of the Public Library, Swanston-street was gay with torchlights, the Germans of the city having combined to serenade him on his"], [461, "THE DEADLOCK.\u2014 1866 TO 1869. 439 way homeward. An enormous crowd was again gathered ; two long lines of torches down the street left a lane, and as the prince passed onward the sound of the chorus of men's voices finely blended in some rich old German part songs, rolled with charming effect over the sea of torchlit faces. For two days more Melbourne kept lusty holiday. The last, on the 31st of November, was occupied with horse racing ; the prince was invited to a meeting at Flemington, at which a crowd, considered in those days stupendous, gathered to see him and the races together. Then came a visit to Geelong and the Western district ; with addresses, and masses of school children. Next a flying visit to Ballarat. The prince descended the Band of Hope mine and traversed its gas-lit drives. A levee, a banquet, a German serenade, a review, a regatta, fireworks, and indeed everything that loyal devotion could invent made Ballarat look livelier than it ever had been. A second trip, to Sandhurst and Castlemaine, with a repetition of the same programme, served to make the Prince acquainted with the goldfields \u2014 not the diggings of old ; not the places that had tempted the adventurous spirits of a dozen years before \u2014 but cities, bright and prosperous, and with all the look of having been there for a century. On his return to Melbourne, a long round of festivities was carried on into the beginning of January ; he concluded his laborious pleasures by inaugurating the construction of the new graving-dock at Williamstown to which his name was given, the name of Alfred being then popular for new institutions, and being in especial assigned to a new hospital of which he laid the foundation-stone. At length the Galatea departed down the bay accompanied by nine steamers. The Prince carried with him quite a consignment of golden trowels, while the colony proceeded to pay its bills and settle down again to business. The State expenditure exceeded thirty thousand pounds. The expenditure by private persons was estimated at a quarter of a million. It was a large sum for two months of holiday-making, but no one seems to have regretted it ; the colony was prosperous, and it had a perfect right to grant itself the gratification of its wishes in testifying its devotion to the Empire, even if in the enthusiasm of the moment, its loyalty was a little exuberant. The Prince's visit caused the Parliamentary recess to be longer than it would otherwise have been, considering the unsettled state of politics. The Governor had called both Houses together for the 25th of November, to hold a one day's session in connection with the public reception of Prince Alfred ; but on the 30th of December, the Assembly was dissolved. The election campaign then commenced, McCulloch announced that the question before the country was\u2014 whether or not the Assembly was to have complete control of the finances. Higinbotham was the orator of the party. He met a monster meeting in the Exhibition Building, and with the other members of the Cabinet surrounding him on the platform, he delivered one of his most telling addresses. He told the people that in this colony we have three estates. The circumstances of a young society had given us two : a representative of the Crown, and the representatives of the people. We ourselves have created the third estate ; \u2014 unwisely, perhaps\u2014 perhaps in a spirit of vulgar imitation ; this third estate is an oligarchy of wealth, and has attempted to assert a claim to be the principal one of the three. It is for the people of this colony to say if this claim is to be allowed ; and it is the duty of the constituencies to see that seventy-eight men are chosen who shall be resolved to settle this question once and for ever. James Balfour also spoke in support of the Ministry. He read a portion of a despatch published that day in the Government Gazette; it had just been received from England, and Vol. 1. jE"], [462, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 440 in it, the Secretary of State for the colonies fully approved of all that Governor Manners-Sutton had done. At this the great crowd burst out into immense cheering; the point being readily taken that the English Government were now condoning in Manners-Sutton the same conduct that they had formerly condemned in Sir Charles Darling. There was a difference, however, a radical difference between the positions of the two Governors ; but it was perhaps a trifle too subtle to be readily perceived by the masses, especially in the heat of political conflict. The Constitutional party, in answer to Higinbotham's manifesto, declared that the issue before the people, was whether the country was to have two Houses of Parliament or only one. They appealed to the electors not to convert the Government into a mere tyranny of an unchecked popular Assembly. But the decision was against them. The new Assembly was in favour of McCulloch, by a majority of sixty against eighteen. In England there had been another change at the Colonial Office. Three of the members of Lord Derby's Cabinet had resigned through internal dissensions as to the extension of the franchise in England, and one of these was Lord Carnarvon. His place was taken by the Duke of Buckingham, who, on the 1st of January, wrote forbidding the Governor to interfere in any manner in securing the adoption of the Darling grant. This despatch arrived early in. March, immediately before the assembling of Parliament. In it there was one passage which by implication directed the Governor not to allow the Darling grant clause to be inserted in the Appropriation Act. Sir John -Manners-Sutton, on the 6th of March, laid this despatch before the Cabinet, who, after four days of deliberation, informed him that they would not submit to any condition inconsistent with the insertion of the clause in question as part of the Appropriation Act. McCulloch knew he must win. His majority was overwhelming, and Parliament was to meet on the 13th. He resigned, and all the Ministry with him. The Governor was, of course, well aware that he could not maintain a contest. No money could be voted for the public service without the consent of the Assembly, and only eighteen out of seventy-eight would agree to vote a penny till the Darling grant was passed. But he went through all the necessary forms, mainly, it must be imagined, in order to comply with instructions from the Colonial Office; to obey a mandate from that \"foreign nobleman\" who figured in lively fashion in some of Higinbotham's philippics of that period. The Governor invited Mr. Fellows to form a ministry; but that gentleman stipulated for the right to a dissolution of the Assembly should it refuse to grant supplies. The Governor saw no sense in such a condition, as the Assembly, just elected after great trouble and expense, had not yet met; and, indeed, was just on the point of meeting. Then Captain MacMahon was asked to form a ministry. He declined the hopeless task. The next invited was Mr. J. C. Riddell. After four days of exertions, he had secured only one adherent, and accordingly he notified his inability to proceed. Parliament meantime had met, and time was pressing. The Governor tried again, and asked first Sladen, then T. T. a Beckett, both members of the Council. They declined the invitation. As if to increase the Governor's troubles, there came a new despatch from the Duke of Buckingham, dated 1st February. In it there seemed to be a general tone of regret that the Council refused to pass the Darling grant under the circumstances, and this change of attitude greatly perplexed the Governor, who professed his earnest desire to comply with instructions, but his inability to understand what these instructions were. During all this time McCulloch's Ministry had been fulfilling the duties of their offices while waiting to be relieved by their successors. They declared their weariness at the long delay."], [463, "THE DEADLOCK.\u2014 1866 TO 1869. 441 The Governor asked them to withdraw their resignations. McCulloch refused unless permitted to carry out his policy in his own way. He knew very well whither the drift of affairs was leading. Public meetings on all hands condemned the interference of the Duke of Buckingham, and enthusiastically assured the Ministry of the people's confidence. A deal of nonsense might sometimes have been spoken, but there could be no doubt that, rightly or wrongly, the nation by an overwhelming majority was in favour of McCulloch, who, therefore, refused to retain office unless on condition of a complete surrender. of genuine ability, became Treasurer ; William Bayles was Commissioner of Cus toms ; G. B. Kerferd, Min ister of Mines, with a second office added ; and Michael O'Grady, Commissioner of Public Works. It was not a strong Cabinet, and it was generally thought that its main reason for existence was to pass the weeks as quietly as possible till the Governor should receive an answer to his application for definite instructions from London. This the Governor was loth to yield. He begged of Sladen to try once more. Surely a Cabinet could be formed out of all the Council and the eighteen members of the Assembly that were opposed to McCulloch. This time there was more ap pearance of success ; Sladen induced Fellows to accept office as Minister of Justice, and Gillies to take two port folios. Mr. A. MacDonncll, hitherto little known, be came Attorney-General, and Edward Langton, a man Seven of the new Ministers had to present themselves for re-election after resuming office. Two were returned unopposed ; Kerferd, MacDonnell, and Bayles succeeded after a fierce struggle, but the popular feeling was too strong for O'Grady and Gillies. The latter, when he sought the suffrages of Ballarat East, was met by a fierce storm of popular indignation ; the electorate returned by preference a Mr. C. E. Jones, a demagogue whom a less passionate constituency might have distrusted. It was hopeless for Sladen to proceed. His followers in the Assembly did not amount to a quorum, so that the Opposition by merely staying away could absolutely paralyse all public action. On 6th June, however, the Assembly met, and by a large majority declared it had no confidence in the new Ministry. Yet Sladen, with defeat full in view, strove to carry on the business of the country. On 8th July McCulloch carried a resolution in the Assembly that no supplies would be granted to the Sladen Ministry. Now came the final tussle of the deadlock ; and on both sides efforts were made to influence the issue by public meetings, The Constitutional party gathered in a large crowd at St. George's Hall, and Murray Smith met with a cordial reception in his condemnation of the arbitrary course of the Assembly. But on the other hand ten thousand people assembled in the Richmond Park to support McCulloch The trade societies, with banners flying, and headed by delegates from Sandhurst, Ballarat Geelong, Castlemaine, Kyneton, and fourteen other towns, marched in procession. As they passed the Treasury they gave three thundering cheers each for the Queen, for Darling, and for McCulloch. Berry was the principal speaker. He was now in full accord with public sentiment, being a staunch supporter of McCulloch. He moved a resolution that the Ministry were unconstitutional"], [464, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 442 in retaining office after a vote of want of confidence. He condemned the action of the Governor, at the mention of whose name three dismal groans of long duration were given. James, of Ballarat, declared that the people had borne the present state of affairs with wondrous patience; he had no wish to see another Eureka Stockade, but\u2014 and the terrible catastrophe his words unfolded was lost in the tumult of applause. The Sandhurst delegate declared that Bendigo had nailed its colours to the mast; a sentiment which others of the delegates reiterated of their respective towns. A resolution was passed that if the Governor should dissolve Parliament before a solution of the difficulty occurred, the people should take steps to appoint a National Convention for the purpose of watching over the rights of the people. The very day after all this bluster there came, by the mail, a despatch which removed the trouble and dispelled the stormy weather that seemed to lie in the future. The Governor had early in the year applied to the Duke of Buckingham for definite instructions ; the Duke had apparently been in perplexity. It seemed to him the most feasible course to cut the Gordian knot by inducing Sir Charles Darling to decline the proffered grant. That of course was only a question of money, and by offering to Sir Charles his reinstatement in the Colonial service, and a handsome compensation from the Imperial Treasury, it was a matter of no great difficulty to persuade him to send a letter to the Colonial Office stating that he had resigned the service under a misapprehension, that he wished to be reinstated, and that he would formally decline to receive the grant. News to that effect was telegraphed to India in time to catch the mail steamer which arrived in Melbourne on 12th July, and it became immediately known that the deadlock was over and the cause of quarrel removed. The day before this news arrived Sladen had abandoned his effort to accomplish an impossibility and M'Culloch had returned to power. And not only had the popular party secured this triumph, but the Council itself, feeling its isolation and weaknees, had initiated a reform of its own constitution. On the 30th of June a select committee had been appointed to report on that subject. It recommended that the property qualification of members should be reduced from five thousand pounds to two thousand five hundred, and that of electors from a hundred pounds to fifty, a change that would increase the votes from 12,000 to 19,000; and make the Council a more popular body. The veteran Fawkner raised his voice against this tinkering with the constitution. \"If we are to sink to manhood suffrage as a basis for this House, then farewell to good government and the prosperity of the colony ;\" \u2014 a very different voice from the fiery democracy of olden times when Fawkner was the turbulent champion of the poorer classes. The bill was passed by the Council, which hoped in this way to mollify public opinion. In the Assembly McCulloch accepted the measure as a first instalment of reform; it might prevent a recurrence of the strife they had just witnessed. Higinbotham, however, declared that the proposed system would give the Council renewed vigour for mischief. By making it more representative, it would become stronger; yet it would not really represent the whole body of the people. It would, therefore, be stronger only in the direction of thwarting the popular views, more especially as it could not be dissolved, each of its members holding his seat for ten years, though having to retire in rotation. Public opinion could not adequately act on a body so constituted. He would strike at the root of the evil, and reform the Council radically and without compunction. The bill, however, was passed on the 28th of September, and on the following day received the Governor's assent just before his prorogation of this eventful Parliament."], [465, "THE DEADLOCK\u2014 1866 TO 1869. The popular victory was by no means complete, yet it was sufficient; and it showed the working classes the power they could wield in a young country if only they were united. The backbone of the democracy, however, was seen to be the trades unions; only by their means could co-operation and organisation be readily secured, and the artisans were led to draw closer round their trade societies, which became strong and even wealthy bodies. On the 20th of June 1869 the mechanics of Melbourne held a meeting to adopt measures for the erection of a handsome new hall to take the place of the temporary wooden building which had seen so many stormy debates in the last ten years. Sir William Stawell took the chair; G. P. Smith and other prominent men were among the speakers. Fellows good-humouredly compared the reception he then received with what he had to suffer in the way of groans and exclamations on the occasion of his passing a trade procession in Collins-street only a year before. But all that was over now; and ere long all sections of the community joined heartily in the inauguration of the new building, which was formally dedicated as the memorial of the winning of the Eight Hours system, that privilege, secured by Victoria, before all other lands \u2014 a privilege which the working man had good reason to prize. During the progress of the struggle now happily ended, several veterans had passed away. Heales was gone, and Haines; and on the 4th of September, Fawkner also bade farewell to a stormy but useful life. He had been an assiduous member of the Council even while old age with its maladies was stealing upon him. Asthma had long shaken his thin little frame. In his seventy-seventh year he succumbed, and died a peaceful death at his residence in Collingwood. His funeral was a feature long to be remembered. That afternoon nearly two miles of carriages lined the thoroughfare of Smith-street hushed in silent respect, and a crowd of twelve thousand people densely filled the streets round the Independent Church in Oxford-street where ministers of various denominations were united in the funeral service. Over the vast area of the city the minute bells of a hundred churches tolled in mournful cadence; flags stood half-mast high, and miles of shops were closed along the route traversed to the cemetery, through that busy, bustling, hopeful, metropolis, the home of nearly two hundred thousand people, the centre of five hundred thousand more \u2014 a great city, with suburbs stretching league on league, where only thirty-three years before, John Pascoe Fawkner, even then in middle life, had landed, an adventurous pioneer to lay his head in a tent, with the weird midnight sounds, of a far-extending forest ringing in his anxious ears, and with a careful sentry set to watch beside the fitful camp-fire, the only sign of habitation over all these tree-tipped undulations and those leaf-covered valleys.

TLhe Eva of Egnculture. 1869 TO 1875. \\ \\W*%\\ colony of Victoria in her earliest years made little effort to provide herself rH GSM , with her own foodstuffs, her energies being concentrated in pastoral pursuits. ME$ WSrA When the gold discoveries brought crowds of people to dwell within her filial HwJ shores, she was still less in a condition to supply them with the wheat and \u00bb \u2014^ other farm produce they required. The importation of grain therefore became of large proportions, averaging in value about a million sterling each year. But from 1856 onward, the colony made rapid strides towards the supply of her own wants, though still, to a large extent, dependent on the foreign farmer. It was about the year 1870 that she first began to take rank as an agricultural community. In that year, for the first time, she produced all she needed, and had a little left for export. The two following seasons were not so propitious, and again, to a small extent, grain had to be imported ; 1873 and 1874 were once more years of export ; then came two years which showed another fluctuation, small quantities of grain having to be introduced ; but finally, in 1878, the colony settled down to agricultural prosperity, and from that time has never failed, not only to suffice for herself, but also to export large quantities of grain to the average annual value of about one million sterling. Victoria, New Zealand, and South Australia now rank equally as grain producers. Their total exports of corn are small in comparison with the gigantic trade ol Air.crica and Russia, yet they make some little figure among those states of the world"], [467, "THE ERA OF AGRICULTURE. -1869 TO 1873. 445 which contribute more than they receive of the food that supports mankind. And, while Victoria began to make her mark as a grain-producing country, she also took a modest place among the wine-producers, having in this industry by far the leading position of the Australasian group. The yield of her vineyards since then has generally averaged about a gallon for each individual of the population \u2014 a proportion which, though only one-twentieth part of that which France and others of the distinctly wine-growing countries can average, is yet sufficient to give Victoria a standing in the wine markets of the world. The attainment of success in agricultural and viticultural pursuits began to be noticeable in the period about 1870 Then it was that the colony clearly recognised the agricultural possibilities of its future ; then it was that the Government found it desirable to add a department of agriculture to its public service ; then it was that the great agricultural societies took their origin, and that agricultural shows began to form important items in the annual history of the colony. But this success was only attained after much agitation and stormy contests between conflicting interests. The colony in its earliest years had been divided among pastoral tenants, who, after long complaint, had received, by the Orders-in-Council of 1847, something like fixity of tenure. In 1854 thousands upon thousands of those who had come to the colony in search of gold had abandoned that pursuit as being precarious, and of declining value. They did not, however, desire to depart from the colon)', and great numbers proposed to settle on the land. Here then, was a large democratic tide, beating with fierce agitation against the position in which the 800 or 900 squatting tenants had entrenched themselves. The example of America was constantly adduced. She took the most extreme pains to facilitate the settlement of the mass of her people upon her waste lands ; she made the terms so easy that the poor man might hope by his industry to build up his little competency for old aee out of the modest farm his labour could carve out of the backwoods. There was, however, a difference. Those lands in America were absolutely waste. No use was being made of them. In Victoria, however, all that was immediately useful was occupied for the growth of wool, and when the people clamoured for this land they met a steady opposition from those who already held it. The squatters continued to plead pre-emptive right ; the people to urge that at an average of less than twopence an acre of annual rent these holders had an advantage which ought not to be renewed to them. It was maintained that a farming population spread over a well-tilled country would bring plenty and prosperity to a teeming population throughout districts where, at that time, a flock of two thousand sheep, tended by a single shepherd, would be the sole occupants of a vast estate ; and so, with much to be said on both sides, the struggle began in 1854, and was finally settled in 1869. It so happened that in Victoria the land regulations of 1847 had never been ratified. In 1 85 1 Latrobe had not yet issued formal leases, and after the gold discoveries he declined to do so. Hence, though the squatters had an equitable claim, their legal position was unsound, and the whole question of the land policy was uncertain and unsatisfactory. But in 1855 came the despatch of Sir John Pakington, transferring to the Government of the colony the complete control and management of its Crown lands. Imperial legislation had therefore now no longer the force it formerly had, and in 1856 Andrew Clarke, being by virtue of his office of Surveyor- General a member of the first Cabinet of the colony under Haines, brought in a bill to define the law in regard to lands. It followed the Imperial order by dividing the colony into three parts, but they were differently named. All lands were to be sold by auction\u2014 town lands at a minimum of \u00a38 per acre, suburban lands at 30s., and country lands at \u00a31. Pastoral tenant-"], [468, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 446 might obtain leases at a rental of not less than \u00a325 for each district calculated to furnish support for 1000 sheep. This was popularly regarded as a squatters' measure, and not at all to be compared to the liberality of American land laws. The people soon made their voice heard, and what was called the \" Land Convention\" was formed. It consisted of eighty-eight delegates from all parts of the country, who met in a room almost opposite the Parliament House, and there, with gravity, order, and ability, discussed the various theories of land legislation that were proposed in the interests of general happiness. It was an assemblage of singular earnestness. Its president was Wilson Gray, its vice-presidents were Sir George Stephen and Michael Prendergast, and among its office-bearers were Thomas Loader and J. J. Walsh. The programme adopted by this convention was that of free selection to the extent of 320 acres. It proposed that any man should be able to choose a farm wherever he pleased upon the unalienated lands, and that he should be allowed to complete the price of \u00a31 an acre in a system of deferred payments. The leaders of this movement were all actuated by a warmly philanthropic spirit. Their arguments might be met by others of equal weight ; but of the kindly disinterestedness that actuated the leading spirits there can be no doubt, though, of course, the moving impulse in the masses was little but self-interest. Wilson Gray was an Irishman of liberal education, and a barrister. In 1835 he had served in England for three years as a commissioner on the Poor Law inquiry, and seems from that time forward to have warmly interested himself in the cause of the working classes, and particularly on behalf of the smaller sort of farmers.1 He then went to America, where he passed some years in the West, among the farming districts, and in 1848 wrote a pamphlet on \" Self-Paying Colonisation,\" in connection with the emigration then going on from Ireland. His contention was that in countries like America and Australia there was vast opportunity for the settlement of prosperous farmers if only some wisdom were shown in the formation of land laws. He was never tired of descanting on the happiness of that country, where thousands of thriving farming families were scattered over a fertile land, each in its own cottage, with its sheltering vine and fig-tree making green its garden. In 1854 he came to Victoria and tried his fortune on the diggings, but shortly afterwards returned to his own profession as a barrister in Melbourne. The statutes, however, occupied but little of his attention compared with that pet project of his that was to make the wilderness look gay, and the solitary place become glad. Sir George Stephen, who took the position of vice-president of the Land Convention, was the hero of the abolition of slavery. The movement for emancipation had been begun at the end of the eighteenth century by Wilberforce, Clarkson, Zachary Macaulay, and James Stephen ; but as they grew old, and the work was still unaccomplished, they had left it to the younger men, James Stephen bequeathing his share to his son George, who, in its late years, became the prime mover and untiring labourer in that memorable agitation. He was the author and manager of that plan of campaign which led to the abolition of slavery in 1834, and was knighted by the King in recognition of his services. .After that date George Stephen lived a quiet life as a lawyer in Liverpool, but in 1855 he followed his two sons to Victoria, where they were settled. Though sixty-one years of age, he still had in him plenty of fire, and his old philanthropic instincts impelled him to join the band whose dream it was to fill Victoria from end to end with \" a bold peasantry, their country's pride.\" Men like Wilson Gray and Sir George Stephen and C. J. Don gave the Convention Sir Robert Stout's Memoir of Wilson Gray, in the Melbourne Review, vol. 7,"], [469, "THE ERA OF AGRICULTURE.-1869 TO 1873. 447 a standing in spite of the hostility of the wealthier classes, and in the theoretical debates of its first session, from the 15th of July 1857 to the 6th of August, there were brought to light some of the men who were afterwards to take a prominent part in our politics. There it was that Duncan Gillies, as delegate for Ballarat, first displayed his ready talent as a debater, and there George Verdon, as delegate for Williamstown, first attracted public attention. The Land Convention, amid much that was visionary, threw itself into the practical work of opposing the bill which Haines' Ministry had prepared. It resolved on three principles which it pledged itself to maintain. The first was free selection at a uniform price without auction, so that the wealthy, by outbidding the poorer man, should not be able to keep him off the land. The second was that all Crown lands not sold should form a free pasturage open to all the people ; surely an unreasonable request when the State was even then in receipt of a quarter of a million annually for that privilege. The third was that no new pastoral tenancies should be created when the land occupied under license should be resumed by the Crown. What the squatters were to do with their 5,000,000 of sheep these enthusiasts did not trouble to consider. In their zeal they did not look beyond the horizon of the interests of the working classes. The Convention was in alliance with a strong minority of twenty-two in the Assembly, whose leaders were Gavan Duffy and Macpherson Grant, and which included O'Shanassy, David Blair, Ebenezer Syme, and J. B. Humffray. The discussion was largely a duel between Duffy and Grant on the one side, who denounced the proposal of Haines as a swindle ; and on the other, Fellows and Sladen, who regarded it as a fair compromise between the squatters, who certainly had in equity acquired certain rights, and the people, who were anxious to secure the land for farming. On the 19th of June 1857 the second reading of Haines' Bill was passed by thirty-two to twenty-two, at the conclusion of a prolonged sitting. Great excitement prevailed through the country, as there were provisions in the bill that were eminently unpopular, notably those providing for sale by auction and for the renewal of pastoral leases at \u00a325 per annum. The third reading passed formally, and the bill went forward to the Council, which, to every one's surprise, rejected it without discussion by twenty-one votes to six. The squatters in the Council had no reason to desire this bill unless it would please the people ; they would much prefer to see all things remain as they were, and they therefore rejected the bill without assigning reasons. The first phase in the contest was completed. The members of the Convention returned to their homes, leaving a council of twenty-one to watch over the interests of the people. But until the next general election nothing could be done except to keep the matter before the public, and to educate the electors to the views of the part)-. At length the elections came on towards the end of 1859, and the Land Convention party wished to put Wilson Gray forward as their leader, but he drew back. An extreme modesty and diffidence, peculiarly combined with his ardour and devotion, caused him to decline the position, which in truth required a man of robuster build, both mental and physical. He feared that he was too poor, and too little gifted with eloquence, to occupy the prominent position assigned to him. William Nicholson, a man of considerably less ability, but of greater social status, was then chosen as leader, and he in 1S60 took an early opportunity of introducing a bill to alter the land laws in the direction of the popular desires. He was then Premier, having replaced O'Shanassy's Ministry very shortly after the opening of Parliament. The bill was a composite production \u2014 the work of a Cabinet who held very varied views on the subject of land legislation. It went perhaps half-way towards the realisation of the Land Convention's Vol. I. 3F"], [470, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 448 wishes, but no further. It provided for free selection after the land had been surveyed by the proper authorities. This, of course, implied that the Survey department would have it in its power to confine the settlement of farmers to such districts as it chose for the purpose ; and the popular idea was that these districts would be so chosen as to conflict as little as possible with the interests of the squatters. The Land Convention wanted to have the system of free selection before survey, so that the farmer who intended to cultivate the soil should be able to go out upon the Crown lands, choose the place that suited him best, apply for a survey of it, and so secure it. Nicholson's Ministry thought that a fair compromise would be effected by surveying the land in extensive blocks, making an aggregate of perhaps 4,000,000 acres at a time, and that within that wide area the selector might have ample room for choice. The selector could take any number of acres between 80 and 320 ; he must purchase a quarter of it at \u00a31 per acre, and the balance could be held at an annual rental of is. 6d- per acre ; but he must also improve the land during his first year of occupancy to the extent of \u00a31 per acre. To comply with the popular demand for free selection before survey, it was provided that if four persons clubbed together, and paid down in cash as a preliminary the price of a quarter of the land they wished, and a year's rent for the land not immediately purchased, and if they were ready to improve their land \u00a32 per acre within the first year, they should be permitted to demand a survey of such land as they thought would suit them. In all cases where several applicants chose the same land, the preference was to be given to the one who offered the highest sum for the privilege. These provisions did not meet the views of the Convention. The poor man who wished to go a-farming under this law would have to pay \u00a380 at once, and spend \u00a3320 on his holding within a year, and then pay \u00a318 a year as rent, unless he could pay down the balance of \u00a3240. And if a wealthier neighbour desired the same allotment, the poor man would have to submit to a competition to secure it. The Convention desired that there should be a system of deferred payments to assist the struggling farmer at starting, and that the assignment should be made by lot and not by auction ; also, that it should not be necessary for four to club together in order to secure the privilege of selection before survey. There could be no doubt that the proposals of the Convention amounted to class legislation of a very pronounced character. The squatters wanted the land, and were ready to buy it ; but the State was not to suffer them to possess it. The land was to be kept for the poor man, even though he was unable to pay what was clearly the market value, as indicated by competition among those who desired to obtain it ; it was to be given at a low rate to the poor man, who was the State favourite, no matter what other people might offer for it; and even this reduced price was to be paid by a system of deferred payments without interest. The State was, in short, asked to make deliberately a bad bargain in the prospect of gatherino some ultimate advantages. These were that the country, instead of being parcelled out among a few wealthy proprietors, would be held by prosperous thousands of substantial yeomen. Instead of seeing multitudes of sturdy citizens depart for other lands, leaving Victoria again to that desolation and solitude in which it was best fitted to become the most notable wool producer in the world, the nation would perceive villages everywhere springing up, and cottages dotting the face of the country. It was one of those delicate economic problems which, since the time of Athens, and probably long before it, have divided communities into two sections ; the aristrocratic instincts of some desiring that wealth should ho]d the land, and spread its beneficent influence over"], [471, "THE ERA OF AGRICULTURE.\u2014 1869 T0 1873. 449 the people whom it employed upon its lordly estates ; the democratic instinct of others dis daining the proffered patronage and demanding an independent opportunity of gathering sub sistence from that earth whose fruits they regarded as the common birthright of all who chose to till it and reap its harvests. Should the State take the money of the wealthy in exchange for the land, and suffer great territorial estates to monopolise the country? No, said the democratic party; the colony will then no longer be the chosen home of those toiling industrious millions who may one day be a far more mighty source of ultimate wealth. But on the other hand there was a knotty question to propound. Shall the State give away its noble domains for less than their value \u2014 for much less than may easily be had for them \u2014 in order to savour the poor man and defeat the perfectly legitimate ambition of the rich ? No, said the squatter, the State should hold the balance true, and dispense an even-handed justice between man and man With arguments fairly divided, and reasons upon each side that seemed overwhelming until the other side received a hearing, Victoria became, in 1860 and 1861, one great field for the discussion of land bills. On its second reading Nicholson's Land Act passed without a division, but on going into committee the Assembly dealt severely with it. One important point was to be conceded to the Land Convention, and yet in another direction the bill was to be made less liberal. On the one hand the provision for sale by tender was struck out, and it was resolved that if there were more than one applicant for the same allotment it should be assigned by lot ; but on the other hand all provision for selection before survey was expunged. Wilson Gray was by this time in Parliament. Early in 1860, seeing that the process of legislation was not likely to be what he so ardently desired, he suffered himself to be nominated for Rodney, and was duly elected. He now fought hard for the principle of selection before survey, but lost it by five votes. The bill thus modified was, in May 1860, sent up to the Council, which passed it on the second reading on the understanding that alterations were to be postponed until its progress through committee. And certainly they carried out that understanding, for no less than two hundred amendments were made in it. The very first swept away the system of charging a uniform price, and directed the land to be put up as formerly to auction; indeed, the whole bill was transformed from end to end. Nicholson at once sent in his resignation. There were serious dissensions in his Cabinet, James Service and J. G. Francis disagreeing with some of his proposals. In the Assembly, Duffy, Gray, and Don loudly charged him with treachery in having betrayed the popular party, who had expected a truly liberal measure, and had been deluded with a compromise. Yet here he saw this very measure summarily stopped in its progress, because the Council regarded it as being much too liberal. Governor Barkly asked him to retain his office and effect a compromise with the Council. He consented, and on 28th June faced a very stormy meeting of the Assembly, when the amendments of the Council were discussed. Most of them were rejected, Gray and his party refusing any compromise. The Council declined to pass the bill without their alterations. Council and Assembly each appointed a committee, and a conference was held, from which there emerged a compromise with so few concessions to popular wishes that it could not possibly have any stability in a country where, with manhood suffrage as the law of the land, popular wishes were certain to prevail. The popular party in the Assembly\u2014 Heales, Duffy, Gray, Don, and their followers desired a dissolution, so that an appeal to the country might be made on the main details of the"], [472, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 450 bill, but the Governor refused. The people were at once aroused. A mass meeting of nearly six thousand persons filled the Eastern Market, and a sea of faces, lit by the streaming lamp flames, gathered round Dr. Hunter, in the chair, or rather in the cart, to hear him urge that now or never should the people resolve to possess the land for the formation of a bold yeomanry, and bid defiance to the oligarchy that proposed to monopolise it. The land was the main sheet of their prosperity. WTould they give it up ? And a deep answer, \" No,\" rolled up from the crowd. J. J. Walsh moved that in the opinion of that meeting the Governor, by refusing a dissolution, was playing into the hands of the faction that proposed to cheat the people of their rights. Wilson Gray seconded. He declared that there were three things that every man in the country should have. First, a vote, which, indeed, they all now possessed ; second, a rifle, which he trusted they all had ; third, a farm, which they must have and would have, even if the second item had to be used for the purpose. He deplored the mistake that had been made by Sir Henry Barkly. Thereupon came groans and ejaculations from the crowd. Mr. Crews then invited all who were present to gather next day in Parliament yard. Let them all be peaceable, but show their strength and their determination to be bamboozled no longer. Graham Berry and C. J. Don both addressed the meeting, which then quietly dispersed. Next day, at five o'clock, a large crowd began to gather around Parliament House, the majority of them wearing a ribbon. They stood chatting in knots, and a few attempted to force a way into the building, but were stopped by the police. At six o'clock Wilson Gray appeared, and was greeted with tumultuous cheering. He invited them to follow him down Bourke-street to the Eastern Market, and having got them there, lectured them on the line of conduct they ought to adopt, and warned them against the use of violence. Crews, on the other hand, told them not to suffer any intimidation ; while Don said that though he regretted that there was a conspiracy to keep the people from the possession of the land, yet it would be very bad policy for any man, through his desire to get upon the land, to get into gaol intsead. Yet there were inflammatory cries in the crowd. Some wished to proceed to the Parliament House and expel the members. Others proposed to march to Toorak, and hold an interview with the Governor, and miscellaneous suggestions were offered for the future disposal of that dignitary. They marched, however, to Parliament yard, where thirty policemen guarded the lobbies. As the evening advanced the crowd became of immense proportions, and those behind pressing heavily on those nearest the building, the dense mass began to surge heavily to and fro. There were cries instigating those in front to enter the House and pull out the obnoxious members. Some unruly fellows tried to carry out the injunction, but they were too few to force their way past the police. At half-past eight a small body of mounted troopers came galloping up, and rode into the crowd, which offered no resistance, but dispersed. A police force of thirty or forty men advanced to clear the streets, and then there began a scries of unfortunate conflicts, which raged all along Bourke-street and Spring-street till half-past ten. About half-a-dozen civilians were left upon the streets severely wounded ; one was thought to be dead, although he recovered eventually. Seven constables were badly wounded ; and it was not till the mayor, Dr. Eades, came forward and read the Riot Act that the streets were finally cleared. Meantime Nicholson was proving unhappy in his land legislation. Service and Francis resigned their seats on 3rd of September, 1860, rather than follow his course; J. D. WTood and James McCulloch still supported him, but his Ministry was evidently doomed. When the Act came into operation \u2014 that bill which had been the painful compromise of the Council and the Assembly \u2014 the poor man found himself still unable to acquire a farm. If he selected a"], [473, "THE ERA OF AGRICULTURE.\u2014 1869 TO 1873. 451 portion, the neighbouring squatter applied for it also. The choice was a matter of tender, and if the land was a favourable spot in a good run the squatter would often offer \u00a37 per acre rather than have the \"eye\" of his station picked out. The great bulk of the land surveyed for selection was bought up by the squatters at an average of nearly \u00a32 per acre. O'Shanassy's Ministry was the next that took up the vexed question of the lands. Gavan Duffy was a member of the Cabinet as President of the Board of Lands and Works, and on him devolved the duty of piloting the Government into calmer water. The principle of selection before survey had just been established in New South Wales, where John Robertson, after devoting to it all his energies since 1856, had in 1861 succeeded in establishing that popular system. Duffy now resolved to make a strong effort to procure the same success in Victoria. He brought his Land Bill forward early in 1862. A map which he had prepared showed to the Assembly that of the 35,000,000 acres held by pastoral tenants at an average rental of less than 2d. per acre, 10,000,000 were pronounced by the officers of his department to be choice agricultural land. He proposed that within three months of the passing of his Act 4,000,000 of these should be thrown open for selection, whether surveyed or unsurveyed. Each farm was to be not less than 40 acres, nor more than 640 acres in extent, and the selector could either buy it at once for \u00a31 per acre, or pay 10s. an acre at first, and eight yearly amounts equal to 2s. 6d. per acre subsequently. If several persons applied for the same allotment the assignment was to be by lot, and the holder was bound within a year of occupation either to cultivate one-tenth of it, or to fence it securely, or to build a residence upon it. The bill instructed the Government always to keep 2,000,000 acres open for se lection out of the 50,000,000 more or less suitable for that purpose, but any land which lay open for selection for one year without being occupied was to be offered for sale by auction at a minimum of \u00a31 per acre. not be selected within the year, and would therefore fall into the hands of the squatters in great tracts. The Assembly, at their de sire, extended to three years the period that was to be allowed for selection before sale by auction. One clause of the bill allowed the issue of leases to squatters for periods not exceeding nine years, and this secured the passing of the bill when it went up to the Council in June 1862. Heales, Gray, and Berry attacked this last provision, as a manifest op portunity for the squatter. The bulk of the land would (SIR) CHARLES GAVAN DLTFY Duffy was proud of his scheme, and published pamphlets in Melbourne and in London to let the world know that now at length Victoria was the working man's paradise \u2014 where land as rich as any in America, but lying under a climate of ripening sunshine, where crops would grow both winter and summer \u2014 might now be had on the easiest of terms by the bond fide farmer. But soon it became apparent that the great majority of the land was to pass into other hands. For the provisions of the Act were so loosely drawn that the squatters found no difficulty in taking up the land under the easiest terms. Each of them could find a supply of convenient persons known by the name of \"dummies.\" These could select 640 acres each, which could be had for as many pounds. The dummy was, no doubt, forbidden by law to select again within the"], [474, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 452 same year, but next year he might proceed as before. The squatter provided money for fencing the land as prescribed by the Act, and then when the fee simple was issued by the Land department he bought the allotment from the dummy, who immediately moved on to the next allotment and conveyed it in the same manner. Thus, in the Geelong district, there were 21 dummies to 28 bond fide selectors. In the Ballarat district only 85 were genuine farmers out of 305. In the Camperdown district, out of 699 selectors, there were not 250 genuine cases, the rest were either speculators or else squatters who thus evaded the Act. About 1,250,000 acres were alienated under this Act, and it was estimated that nearly 1,000,000 of these passed directly or ultimately into the hands of the squatters. For in cases where a genuine farmer took up a selection it generally was a profitable transaction for the squatter to offer him all his outlay and in addition a substantial sum, quite sufficient to induce him to go further afield and try a fresh selection. Nor are the squatters to be wholly blamed. Here was land which they could use with advantage ; most of it was worth, for their purposes, from \u00a32 to \u00a3l per acre. They offered full value to the State, which declined to sell, but kept the land for the sole purpose of handing it over at much less than its value to that pet \u2014 that somewhat spoiled darling it had taken to its bosom \u2014 the \" working man,\" who was ungrateful enough to take the State gift at \u00a3l per acre and immediately sell it for 30s., causing a total loss of over two millions to the revenue. An unsuccessful attempt was made by Heales in 1864 to apply a check to these extensive evasions, but his death in that year left the task in the hands of his successor, James Macpherson Grant, whose name was thenceforth always to be remembered in connection with the settlement of the land question in Vic toria. In the following year he introduced a bill provid ing for the new principle of \" probationary leases,\" which, in a modified form, became the final solution of the difficulty. The selector could choose from 40 to 640 acres, which he might lease for five years at a yearly rental of 2s. per acre ; but after a residence of three years upon the land, if he had improved it to the ex tent of \u00a31 per acre, he could obtain the fee simple on completing a total payment of \u00a31 per acre. The As sembly extended the period of the leases to ten years, so that after completing his three probationary years the selector would still have before him seven years in which, by continuing to pay 2s. per acre, he would com plete the full price of \u00a31 per acre and receive his Crown grant. JAMES MACPHERSON GRANT. After some little conflict between the Assembly and the Council this bill became law in the middle of 1865, and at once attained a manifest popularity. The first areas thrown open for selection were in the Western District, from Colac to the South Australian border, from Hamilton to the sea. Each land office was open for an hour a day, and for some weeks 15,000 acres on an average were selected daily in each of the offices. At Hamilton as many as 3000 applicants sometimes appeared in one day. Camperdown, with only 800 inhabitants, often had to supply accommodation to 2000 invaders who were in quest of selections. The applicants, on appearing at the office, were provided with lot tickets on which their names were written. When"], [475, "THE ERA OF AGRICULTURE. -1869 TO 1873. 453 all were so supplied the tickets were placed in a \" wheel-of-fortune ;\" the man whose ticket was first drawn made his choice where he pleased ; then the second man had his choice, and so on. Thus about 1,000,000 acres were disposed of in the months of June and July 1865 ; in August, the operation of the Act settled down steadily to the alienation of about 200,000 acres a month the selectors paying half a year's rent in advance. During the year nearly 9000 selectors were thus settled upon the land, their farms amounting to a total of about 2,000,000 acres. Nearly 500,000 of these were eventually forfeited for the non-payment of rent, the selectors having miscalculated the outlay necessary before a return could begin. But three-fourths of the land thus occupied rapidly assumed an appearance of settlement, for improvements to the value of \u00a31 per acre were necessary within two years or else the Crown lands bailiffs would not sign the certificate, which was required before the purchase could be completed. Archibald Michie, in a lecture at the end of 1866, referred to the change in the Western District as being quite remarkable. \" New farm buildings are going up everywhere ; new fencing is everywhere appearing ; solitudes are becoming peopled, and civilisation is reclaiming the wilderness.\" Grant's legislation had been a success from a popular point of view at any rate, but there was still a considerable amount of evasion. The squatter's dummy could hold the lease for three years and supervise the expenditure of \u00a31 per acre; then when he obtained the fee simple he could readily enough sell to his principal. The Lands department was often well aware of the evasive character of these applications, but if the letter of the law were fulfilled it had no choice but to sell the land. The question was not finally set at rest till the year 1869, when Grant introduced a new bill, with still more liberal provisions, but making the Minister of Lands the sole arbiter and judge as to whether all the required conditions were fulfilled both in spirit and in letter. Many opposed the bestowal of this autocratic power, but Higinbotham and Berry both maintained that no Act could be devised which would prevent the State from being defrauded in its effort to assist the poor man who wished to be a farmer ; an absolute discretionary power was the only possible means of carrying out its intentions. By this new Land Amendment Act any person over eighteen years of age, except a married woman living with her husband, was permitted to peg out and apply for an allotment of not more than 320 acres, either before or after survey. A license to occupy for three years, at 2S. a-year per acre, was then issued ; the land had to be fenced and one-tenth part of it cultivated within two years. At the expiration of three years the occupant could cither pay 14s. per acre, the balance of the full price of \u00a31 per acre, or he could continue to hold the land at 2S. a-year for each acre, with the understanding that as soon as he hnd paid \u00a31 an acre in all he should receive a Crown grant. And the dummy system was defeated by making the Minister of Lands the sole judge as to whether the intention of the Act was being fulfilled. This law came into force in February 1870, and during the next five years 4,500,000 acres of land were occupied on these terms, with only an insignificant intrusion of the dummy element, and no less than 36,790 farms were taken up. Large numbers of these were not permanently held, for those who settled on the land without a little capital to begin with soon perceived their folly and withdrew. But the majority represented a vast addition to the resources of the colony. In the forest the selector reared his bark hut, as did his squatting predecessor only thirty years before. He split, and felled, and burned till a few acres were clear ; he fenced and dug out stumps, and then put in a little crop. He had a struggle at first, but when times were hard he took the nearest employment he could get, and when he had got over the first two years he found the loc<tl bank ready to make him a small advance. By"], [476, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 454 degrees he brought his acres under crop, and changed from a struggling adventurer into a substantial farmer. Now was repeated, on a scale of thirty-fold magnitude, the process that the squatting days had seen. The hut gave way to the weatherboard cottage, neat and comfortable, and often enough surrounded by its tidy garden ; but there was this difference, that now the frequent schoolhouse dotted the land, and churches arose, and a hundred little townships grew busy with supplying the wants of populous districts. Then was the foundation laid of Victoria's agricultural success, and, as year after year rolled by, there was an ever-increasing muster of grain bags for export. The extension of the railway system of the colony assisted the process, and the whole valley of the Goulburn River became one great granary, where in harvest season the sacks of corn gathered in mighty heaps, producing annually what the farmers called the \" grain block,\" for in the season the railways became unable to carry off the abundant harvests as fast as they accumulated. Of course the farmers have their frequent complaints of bad times \u2014 sometimes dry seasons, sometimes low WHEAT-THRESHING IN THE GOULBURN VALLEY prices. They could scarcely be farmers if they wanted that characteristic of their calling, but there cannot be a doubt that the agricultural interests of the colony were placed on a singularly prosperous foundation before the year 1880. Vinegrowing was an industry which made great progress in this agricultural era. It had first been imported into the colony about 1842 by a few Swiss settlers, near Geelong; but no extensive effort was made till 1847, when some German farmers among the Barrabool Hills endeavoured to make their homes resemble the vine-clad slopes of the Rhine. And yet the want of experience to tell which particular species of grape suited best for this or that soil, in this or that district of Victoria, at first marred all their efforts, and though some wine was produced, it was, as a rule, a poor inferior beverage. About 1856, when a few years of experimental losses had been incurred, the vignerons of Victoria, few in number and humble in appliances, had begun to demonstrate beyond doubt that wines of at least moderate quality could be produced in the colony. There were then but 279 acres under vines, and the production was only 11,000 gallons per annum. Ten years later these quantities had increased sixteenfold. Some enthusiasts"], [477, "THE ERA OF AGRICULTURE. i86g '10 iS7j. 455 CRAPE HARVEST AND WINE PRESSING IN VICTORIA. 3G Vo.. I"], [478, "VICTORIA AND FIS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 456 toiled hard and lost their money with patriotic zeal ; among these must be reckoned J. P. Bear and Dr. Hope, J. G. Francis and De Pury, Meredith and Schroeder, the Messrs. Panton and Bruhn, Heine, Klemm, and the White Brothers, but especially the brothers De Castella. Whilst they toiled on in hope ; whilst they experimented and spoiled many a costly vat-full of the rich grape juice; whilst they sought to educate the public taste of the colony to abandon unreasonable prejudices; whilst they strove to get a modest footing for their wines among the older communities in Europe; they saw their labours recompensed by the slow growth of the industry to which they had pinned their faith. In 1876, when the production was nearly half a million gallons a year, wine-making was an assured resource of Victoria and placed upon a commercial basis, though whether the early pioneers who lost their money and their time in devising the means of success were ever personally recompensed, it would be very hard to discover. Now that Victoria possessed a Land Act which gave every poor man a chance of securing a farm, an orchard, or a vineyard; when she gave every man his vote; when she had triennial Parliaments, consisting of members no longer subjected to any property qualification; when her artisans, at the expense of all classes who were not artisans, were carefully protected from foreign competition ; she seemed to have realised at last the complete sum of the democratic ideal. And yet there was one item, so often declared to be the basis of the whole, that without which, as the democratic leaders said, none of the others could possibly be secured, which was still in the future and unattained. Payment of members was still a popular wish which the Council persistently thwarted. In February 1S69 a commission had been appointed to inquire into the subject as illustrated by the experiences of other countries. Their report declared that \" the representatives of the people are compensated in every country where parliamentary government is in operation, except England, some of her colonies, Switzerland and Italy.\" Towards the end of that year Longmore moved for an appropriation from the revenue for the payment of members. Fellows denounced what he called a mere robbery of the Treasury ; a tough debate followed, but again the motion was carried by a considerable majority. A discussion as to the annual amount to be paid was carried on with some asperity, Wrixon asserting that the only effect of the scheme would be the creation of \"pauper politicians;\" but by twenty-six to seventeen it was resolved that members should be paid at the rate of \u00a3300 a year as compensation for that portion of their time which they gave to the service of the State. Next month the bill went before the Council, which at once, and without ceremony, rejected it. There were many threats among the popular party as to what should be done with an Upper House which persistently thwarted the wishes of the people, but these were merely the occasional utterances of an extreme section. The Assembly in the following year, 1870, made a concession to the Council, and that body, on the other hand, had felt the influence of the large body of evidence in favour of the proposed measure which had been gathered by the Royal Commission. The Assembly in again passing the bill made it a temporary measure; its duration was limited to an experimental period of three years, and in that form the Council agreed to pass it. The Governor gave his assent to the new law on the 29th December, 1870. Thus this stormy question was, for the time being, settled in the manner of the popular aspiration ; and the democratic party had secured all that they had contended for in 1860. But in the meantime a new source of agitation had arisen, which was destined to keep the politicians busy for another ten years. In its broadest form this was the question of the incidence of taxation. There was in Victoria neither property-tax nor income-tax. All the burden of the State was borne by means of Customs duties. A portion of these were imposed"], [479, "THE ERA OF AGRICULTURE.\u2014 1869 TO 1S73. 457 on protective principles and in the interest of the working man, but the great bulk of the duties was levied on tea, sugar, liquor, and tobacco, an arrangement which, as it was easily shown, caused the contribution of the wealthiest capitalist and that of the mechanic to be approximately equal. Now, it has been for a century and more an axiom in political economy that the contribution of each individual should be in proportion to his income. If one man by reason of his ability or his good fortune, or his hereditary advantages, draws \u00a31000 a-year out of the general earnings of the community, and another, by being duller, less educated, less fully equipped with antecedent capital, draws only \u00a3100 a-year as the recompense of the best services he can render, these two men should by no means be compelled to contribute the same amount to the State Treasury. If a man has a large estate over which the State exercises a watchful guardianship, maintaining a large force of police to secure the owner in the possession of that property, and otherwise incurring an expenditure in the interests of property which, in the case of Victoria, was estimated by Edward Langton\" at about \u00a3750,000 per annum, then it is manifestly unfair that he should have nothing to pay for all these special advantages beyond the Customs rates levied on the workman who has no possessions for the State to take care of. But in Victoria, as Langton shows, property then contributed enly \u00a354,000 per annum towards these expenses, which he reckoned at \u00a3762,000 per annum. Victoria, in fact, was then demanding from property-holders a wholly inadequate return for the advantages received. In England property paid 43 per cent, of the total taxation, in America 51, but in Victoria only 18. This was a result that sprang from the history of the colony. There were no property-holders of any great note before 185 1. Those who then occupied the land were merely Crown tenants. But after the gold discovery, those who had money to invest found it a most profitable speculation to buy land ; and those who took up large blocks round the goldfields, or within a hundred miles of the seaboard, found that the enormous increase of population, the formation of roads, and the rapid extension of railways, had given their properties an extraordinary increase in value. They became, in fact, men of ample means, owning landed estates quite capable of comparison with the manorial domains of older lands. The popular party was resolved that the holders of property should in some form or other contribute some two or three hundred thousands a-year as an equitable price for benefits conferred. The Council, as representative of property, demurred, though not with a solid unanimity Some confessed the justice of the claim, some denied it altogether ; the majority resented the proposal chiefly because class seeling was running high, and they felt that the working classes, after diverting the whole current of legislation into channels that would benefit themselves, were now settling down to a policy that would eventually lead to the spoliation of the wealthy for the benefit of the poor. At an early stage of the contest the democratic party split up into two factions ; the more moderate, led by McCulloch (now Sir James McCulloch), wished to do no more than impose upon property, in one form or other, an amount of taxation that would yield perhaps a quarter of a million to the revenue. The more extreme section, of which Graham Berry was recognised as the leader, wished to make the taxation penal. Among other schemes, it wished to impose a progressive land tax with rates rising so rapidly that the holders of estates of large dimensions would be compelled to sell portions in order to avoid the ruinous taxes they would otherwise incur. This policy became known as the \" bursting up\" of large estates. The first contest on the subject took place within the Assembly itself, and so troubled did it make the politics of the time that after 1870 there were no less than seven distinct Ministries in six years, and only one of them attained to an existence of two years. - Melbourne Relic;.1, vol. 2, p. 226."], [480, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 458 McCulloch's second Ministry went out on the 20th September 1869, but it was on a purely personal matter, and practically their successors only held office for a time, until it pleased McCulloch to return. In May 1869 W. M. K. Vale had resigned his position of Commissioner of Customs in McCulloch's Cabinet ; he had been replaced by George Rolfe, who was not a member of Parliament. The Assembly, by a vote of thirty-four to twenty-six, condemned this as unconstitutional, and McCulloch tendered his resignation. The Governor sent for J. A. Macpherson, who gathered a weak Cabinet round him3 \u2014 one that certainly contained two or three men of ability, but with no united principles of action that might form the solid backbone of an administration. When Graham Berry brought forward his budget statement on the opening of a new session in February 1870, it was met by a vote of no-confidence, and on the 9th of April McCulloch returned to power. He formed a small but compact cabinet \u2014 Michie as Attorney- General, and J. G. Francis as Treasurer. J. A. Macpherson himself took a seat as President of the Board of Lands and Works, H. J. Wrixon became Solicitor-General, and Angus Mackay Minister of Mines. William Bates, William Wilson, and T T. a Beckett completed the number. The Ministry was not destined to a long career. At the end of the first year, McCulloch made his proposals with regard to the vexed question of the taxation of property. He desired to place on it a duty of sixpence in the pound ; a scheme that neither pleased the property holders on the one hand, nor, on the other, the party that wished for the \" bursting-up\" policy. McCulloch was defeated by forty-eight to twenty-four, and resigned. Charles Gavan Duffy then became Premier, and with him were associated Grant, Berry, O'Grady, Longmore, M'Lellan, Howard Spensley, Robert Walsh, and W. A. C. a Beckett. Their career in office was by no means one of ease. Their majority in the Assembly was a coalition of several parties actuated by inconsistent views ; and in the Cabinet itself there were reflections of the same dissensions. Duffy strove, by a judicious exercise of patronage, to placate all parties, but after almost a year of office a stormy debate took place on the alleged abuse of patronage by means of which he was maintaining his power. The discussion extended to eleven successive evenings, and led to a resolution expressing disapproval of the Ministry. It was carried by thirty-five votes to thirty-four. McCulloch had no desire to return to power in the unsettled state of affairs that then existed, and Governor Manners-Sutton induced J. G. Francis to form a Government. He was a man of no pronounced ability, but upright, and much respected. He took for his Treasurer Edward Langton, a keen debater, and an able financier. J. J. Casey, James Wilberforce Stephens (son of Sir George Stephens), Duncan Gillies, G. B. Kerferd, Edward Cohen, Angus Mackay, Alexander Fraser, and Robert Ramsay formed a strong combination, and it continued in office a little more than two years. During this period the colony experienced another change of Governors. Sir John Manners- Sutton, who, by the death of his brother in 1869, had succeeded to the title Viscount Canterbury, departed from the colony on the 2nd March, 1873. His manner of discharging his duties had given general satisfaction. He had held aloof from parties ; had acted in a calm and dignified manner, making no comments, forming no personal friendships, though joining pleasantly in social intercourse, and exercising an abundant hospitality. He was succeeded by Sir George Bowcn, who already had passed twenty-three years in administrative experiences.

He came to the colony with a high reputation, both for literary culture and for political skill. That reputation was destined to at least partial shipwreck in Victoria ere he left. When he came to the colony there were already several questions round which struggles were looming up in front ; the taxation of property, the reform of the Council, and the renewal of the bill providing for payment of members were the chief among a number. These questions were to produce another crisis in 1878, but in 1873 a preliminary contest arose in regard to the constitution of the Assembly itself. Though the general basis of the Assembly was manhood suffrage, every man over the age of twenty-one, not disqualified by crime, having a vote; yet, by what was known as the plural system, property had a slight advantage. Any man who held property worth \u00a350 in any district could vote for elections in that district, and so a man of wealth might record his vote in the district where he resided, and then proceed to three or four other districts to vote in each. The amount of difference the system made was not great, the number of additional votes so exercised being by no means large, but, in view of the vital struggle that was imminent, the popular party feared that a small percentage of plural votes might cause them the loss of a seat here and there, which would all go in favour of property holders. Francis introduced an Electoral Bill in 1873 restricting all voting to the district in which the voters resided. The Council rejected it. If the Assembly insisted there must be another deadlock. But even if it waived the point for the present there was still the question of payment of members close at hand, the three years of the temporary Act having expired ; and as it was abundantly clear that a large majority of the Council were opposed to it there seemed an absolute certainty of a third deadlock more formid able than either of the others. Francis therefore thought it de sirable to provide a means of solution for these difficulties. He proposed a somewhat futile measure known as the Norwe gian scheme. It provided that when the two Houses disagreed there should be formed a single House out of their members sitting jointly, who should dis cuss the matter and decide it finally by a majority of the com bined Houses. But the Assem bly now contained eighty-six members, and the Council still had but thirty, so that the Council would enter into such a united body on very unequal terms. Indeed, it would practi cally hand over to the Assembly the sole control of affairs. JAMES GOODALL FRANCIS. It was felt in the Assembly itself that the scheme was a mistake, and though it received the solid support of the Ministerial party, it passed by a majority of only thirty-five to thirty-three. But such a vote amounted practically to a rejection, for it was provided that no alteration in the Constitution could be made without the consent of an absolute majority of each of the Houses and an absolute majority of the Assembly at that time numbered forty-three. Francis was in ill-health, and throughout these complicated affairs could rarely attend in the Assembly. Finding the strain more than his medical advisers would sanction, he withdrew from office in July 1S74; but this did not involve the withdrawal of his Ministry, which still had a majority in the Assembly. Kerferd therefore took the place of Francis as Premier, while Townsend Macdermott took the vacant office of Solicitor-General. Edward Langton, however, retired with Francis, and his place as Treasurer was taken by James Service. The question of"], [482, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 460 payment of members again came up, when it became necessary to renew the former Act. The Assembly passed, without difficulty, a renewal for another term of three years, but the Council, after long discussion, and the exercise of much management and tact, passed it by a majority of only one. The Ministry therefore had escaped, but only barely escaped, a host of troubles in connection with that knotty point. But it could not please the country nor the Assembly even, by the manner in which it proposed to alter the incidence of taxation ; and when Service explained his budget, the bare majority obtained by the Government, only thirty-seven to thirty-six, was clearly not enough for the firm conduct of the nation's business. Kerferd asked for a dissolution. It was refused, and he resigned. Graham Berry then formed an administration, and now for the first time the radical party were actually possessed of power. Berry offered a seat in his Cabinet to his old chief, McCulloch, but the latter declined. Nor would any of the better educated of the members of Parliament accept of office at the hands of Berry, who at that period was certainly the object of much contempt among the wealthy, the professional, the mercantile, and, indeed, the middle classes generally. He was regarded as a political charlatan, and all the newspapers of the time joined in lamenting that a man of that character had secured the position of Premier of a great colony. But he was certainly the popular hero, for he was the only politician prepared to carry out the wishes of the people as a mass at all hazards, and against the most obstinate resistance the Council could offer. He caused it to be plainly understood that nothing could daunt or deter him, and that he would lead the radical party to victory, cost what it might. His following were mostly men whom the agitations of the times had brought forward ; men of a stamp wholly different from that of Higinbotham and Michie, and McCulloch and Francis, who had fought the democratic fight of ten years ago. Men of that class were now drawing back as the aggressiveness of the democratic policy became more and more apparent. Berry himself took the office of Chief Secretary and Treasurer ; that of Minister of Mines was taken by W. C. Smith, both popular and familiar at Ballarat, where he was known as Major Smith, a politician in especially bad odour among the wealthier classes. Peter Lalor became Commissioner of Customs, and John Woods Commissioner of Railways ; what with Francis Longmore as President of the Board of Land and Works, and J. B. Patterson as Vice-President, and James Munro as Minister of Public Instruction, the Cabinet was as radical as it could be made ; Macpherson Grant was the only one of the former leaders of democracy who would take office in it. He became Minister of Justice. But Berry found it impossible to induce another lawyer to join. R. Le Poer Tench, though not a member of Parliament, was after some trouble persuaded to take the office of Attorney-General. And so at last that party was in power which was sworn to take exemplary vengeance upon all wealth and property if it dared to resist the will of the people. Sir George Bowen had no easy time before him, more especially as it was necessary for him not only to keep an eye on the movements of political parties in Victoria, but also to keep a still more careful eye on the wishes and sentiments of the Colonial Office. This dependence on a mere department in London was a matter on which Higinbotham never tired of expressing his strong and indeed strengthening reprobation. Here was a colony, he said, that ostensibly had the privilege of self-government, yet it was always liable at a crisis to be interferred with and thwarted by a foreign potentate, a certain Mr. Rogers, who practically managed affairs in the Colonial Office. But his oratory had no practical effect, for all parties were equally pleased to retain to the fullest extent the connection with the mother country, and the radicals, no matter how radical, had no quarrel with the Queen or the British Government."], [483, "THE ERA OF AGRICULTURE.\u2014 1869 TO 1875. 461 Their sole antipathy was to the landholders, many of whom they accused of acquiring great domains at cheap rates by fraudulent practices. Meantime the English Government seemed to be very far from wishing to interfere in local affairs. On the contrary, it took every means to increase the self-dependence of the colony. In 1870 the last detachment of the Imperial troops departed from Victoria. The colony was prepared to provide for its own defence, and there was no reason why a young and thriving community should remain even in part a burden upon the already over-burdened British taxpayer. In 1854 and 1855 some feeble efforts had been made to estab lish a volunteer system in Victoria, but it was not till 1858 that a force of respectable proportions was enrolled under the super vision of Major-General W. A. Dean Pitt The force consisted of seven corps of artillery with 1 50 men in each corps ; one corps of engineers with 75 men ; thirteen armed corps of infantry, with Lancaster rifles ; seven troops of cav alry, each of 30 men; and in 1863 there were added twoeorps of a naval brigade. They made a total of about 4000 men, and formed several fine serviceable batal lions, at least in the early years of the movement, though THE BATTERY AT QUEENSCLIFF. after twenty years' establishment a general want of enthusiasm produced a decay of the force, and led to its disbandment in 18S4. The first commandant was Colonel Ncill ; then came Colonel Pitt; but the officer whose name is most intimately connected with the force was Colonel Anderson, who for nineteen years was its commander. The annual expenditure on this citizen army amounted to \u00a320,000\u2014 a small sum for 4000 men; but they, of course, gave their services gratuitously, although for some time they were entitled, if they chose, to a grant of 50 acres of land after five years of effective service\u2014 a privilege of which about 2500 in all availed themselves."], [484, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLLS: PAST AND PRESENT. 462 For naval defence the colony has from the beginning mainly relied on the Imperial navy, but at an early period she began to provide a little for her own necessities. In 1864 she purchased a smart steamer, the Victoria, and in 1866 the Imperial Government made her a present of the Nelson, an old-fashioned frigate of twenty guns, to which there were afterwards added two other guns of heavier calibre. At that time the question of providing an adequate permanent defence for the rich port of Melbourne against a marauding force was a great deal discussed, and Sir George Verdon, the Agent-General in London, was directed to carry out the negotiations in London for the construction of an ironclad. The Imperial Government generously offered \u00a3100,000 towards the first cost, in consideration of the Imperial interests involved. The colony would then have to pay only \u00a325,000, but it would have to bear all subsequent costs of main tenance. On the 9th of April 1871 the gunboat, named the Cerberus, arrived in Port Phillip. She was reckoned one of the finest specimens of her class up to that date. Her tonnage was nearly 3500 tons ; she carried four eighteen-ton guns ; and was supplied with everything that warlike science could suggest as being useful. When she anchored in Hobson's Bay a salute from all the shipping welcomed her, and many thousands of persons visited the vessel, in which they took a pride as being the foundation of a future navy. In 1861 batteries were constructed at Williamstown, Sandridge, and Queenscliff. They were primitive affairs, and in 1875, when the colony woke up to the necessity of being better defended, they were recognised to have lost even the little value they once had. Sir William Jervois, a lieutenant-general in the Royal Engineers, was invited to report on a suitable system of defence works. With his advice, and under the supervision of Sir Peter Scratchley, also of the Royal Engineers, batteries were placed upon Swan Island, Point Nepean, and at Queenscliff, and on shoals at the entrance to the harbour. At a later date the colony purchased a small fleet of gun-boats and torpedo-boats \u2014 the most important being the Victoria and the Albert, one of 530 tons, the other of 350, the former carrying a twenty-five-ton gun, the latter one of twelve tons, with smaller pieces to complete their armaments. Thus, the colony made the defence of its capital secure, and in a small way laid the foundation of the army and the navy that perhaps will grow a mighty institution in the suture if men in the interval do not grow wise, and learn to enjoy the blessings of industrious peace, and to suffer their neighbours also to enjoy them. But in the meantime, while men arc still a little lower than the angels, the possession of such a military and naval force gives a sense of national unity and solidity, and a manlier tone becomes more evident and more justifiable in the colony. As a type and symbol of this growing national life, Victoria in 1870 adopted her own distinctive flag. On the 9th of February of that year J. A. Macpherson, as Chief Secretary of the colony, invited about 200 persons to witness the inauguration. On board the Nelson they sailed out into the middle of the Bay and hoisted the flag\u2014 a blue Union Jack, with five white stars, representing the Southern Cross. This was to be the ensign for Govern ment service ; merchant vessels were to carry a flag of the same pattern, but red instead of blue. A loud cheer arose to greet the floating of the bunting, and a salute of guns rolled out in honour of the occasion; and on the further trip across Port Phillip, the guests on board the Nelson, ranged in festive banquet, drank success and unsullied honour to the flag that was to be the emblem of Victoria."], [485, "T EXHIBITION BLTLDING l88o.

CLARKE, BART., occupation, there can be no doubt that it effected what its president. \" advocates expected ; it developed an era of manufactures in the colony which began to make itself prominently felt in the period subsequent to 1875. Victoria then became no longer the pastoral country wherein visitors had found little to see and nothing to describe except flocks and their treatment ; and the melancholy silence of scarcely peopled wastes. No jonger had they to speak chiefly of armies of gold miners and the novel sights of the diggings. Victoria began to display most of the resources of the most highly-civilised lands, and to-day three-fourths of the manufactures which make England busy are to be found in active operation. The progress made by the colony in regard to manufactures is very definitely shown by its successive exhibitions; for, considering the size of the community, it has been remarkably given to displays of that description. It made a first feeble attempt in 1850, but succeeded very much better in another undertaken in 1854. The latter was one of Sir Redmond Barry's schemes for the mental and technical improvement of the people. It was held in a building of pleasant design erected where now stands the Mint ; a structure of wood and iron but with rows of nearly 200 windows, high and narrow and ornamental ; with spacious facades, diversified by balconies decorated with shrubs ; and with parapets crowned with some scores of flags. It cost .\u00a321,000, and provided 19,000 cubic feet of space for 428 exhibits. But the articles of manufacture that were shown were almost wholly imported, the number of factories in the colony being small, and their efforts of a rude and humble description. The first copy of the Age newspaper \u2014 then about to be started in the city \u2014 was printed Vol. I. 3-H"], [486, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 464 under the gaze of the gathered spectators. About 40,000 people visited the place during the month of its continuance. In 1861 Victoria was invited to exhibit at the London Exhibition of 1862; she agreed, but determined to gather her contributions first of all in her own Exhibition building as a preliminary. It was now found that the number of factories of all sorts had fully doubled, but of the 703 exhibits sent in, very few could be called really the products of Victorian manufacture. A small number of creditable efforts were shown, but the great majority of the articles exhibited were merely natural objects, or raw materials. Five years later Victoria resolved to eclipse all former efforts in Australia by an Intercolonial Exhibition on a large scale. Three times as much room was now required, and the old building being unsuitable, a new one was erected behind the Public Library. It cost \u00a325,000, but was so arranged that when the Exhibition was over, the building might serve as a museum in connection with the library until the colony could afford to complete that institution. Sir Redmond Barry was again the president of the commission, but upon Mr. J. G. Knight, its secretary, devolved the main supervision of the arrangements ; Judge Bindon, Dr. Black, and Baron Von Mueller were specially active among the commissioners. Victoria now supplied 1479 exhibitors ; but in addition there were contributions from all the other colonies, as well as from New Caledonia, Mauritius, and the Dutch colonies of the East Indies. These raised the total number of exhibits to nearly 3000, and when C. E. Horsley, the musician, on the 23rd October 1866, brought down his baton at the opening ceremony to bid 300 performers join in the national anthem, the large audience, the effectiveness of the extensive display, the flutter of brilliant banners, the profusion of uniforms, all overtopped by the great pyramid representing the total weight of gold produced in Victoria, gave the exulting colonists of that date a pride they had not known before. Over a quarter of a million visits were paid to this exhibition, which must have had some little educational value, though it certainly gave no very exalted notions of the manufacturing progress of the colony. The saddlers and the agricultural implement makers alone seem to have turned out work which indicated that they had the command of moderately good appliances. At that time the colony manufactured almost all it required of a few articles, such as soap, sugar, confectionery, and biscuits. It made some of its ales, the Carlton Brewery and the Castlemaine Brewery being already well known ; it made some of its preserves and pickles ; it made a little pottery, a little paper, and a little ironware ; it partly supplied itself with furniture, leather, saddles, and harness, but only slightly with boots ; and as for fabrics there were scarcely any made in Victoria. A fourth exhibition in 1872 was only a preliminary to the great shows of London and Vienna in 1873. It was held in the same building, and attracted 161,000 visits. But it was more instructive to note the progress made when a fifth was held in 1875. This, though preparatory to the great exhibition of Philadelphia in 1876, partook of an intercolonial character, and was half as large again as any of the previous efforts, and on this occasion Victoria was able for the first time to make a respectable display of her own manufactures, for she had now 2000 factories, employing 22,000 people, and yielding them wages to the value of \u00a32,500,000 a year ; the metal workers alone earning \u00a3750,000 ; while the coachmakers and the clothiers had a wage list of \u00a3250,000 each. The timber mills paid \u00a3300,000 a year ; the tanneries \u00a3180,000; and so on, the figures indicating that at length Victoria could look on manufacturing pursuits as one of the four great foundations of its prosperity, equal in rank to either pastoral, or mining, or agricultural industries ; and it had the satisfaction of knowing that,"], [487, "THE ERA OF MANUFACTURES- 1873 TO 18S0. with a widening basis of prosperity, the less was the community liable to distressing fluctuations. The protectionists, therefore, how ever they may have violated a cosmo politan law, which may eventually work its own revenge, have justified their position within the bounds of j^j^j^j^H that narrow horizon to which ffl they professedly confined their view ; and they lost no j^j^j^j^H opportunity of strengthening i^i^i^i^H the position they had won. i^i^i^i^H In 1 87 1 Graham Berry, as j^j^j^j^H Treasurer of Gavan Duffy's j^j^j^j^H Ministry, introduced a Cus- j^j^j^j^H stoms Duties Bill, in which j^j^j^j^H ad valorem duties to the j^j^j^j^H extent of 20 per cent, were j^j^j^j^H imposed upon all manufac- j^j^j^j^H tures of metal, on boots, on j^j^j^j^H woodenware, on harness, on j^j^j^j^H jewellery, on hats, and so j^j^j^j^jI forth. It was adopted by j^j^j^j^jI the Assembly, and grudg- .^i^i^H ingly passed by the Council. j^j^j^j^jI I But it was not till 1875 that the un- compromising protectionists ob- tained the full as- cendancy. It was then that Graham Berry formed his first Ministry, all thorough believ- ers in protection, and they would have made some prompt and dras- tic changes if they had remained long in power. But on the land-tax ques tion, which was the first on the programe, this Minis try was man\u0153uvred out of existence. Berry had brought forward a budget which provided for a land tax on all estates over a capital value of \u00a32500. This was his move for pop ular support. McCulloch made a counter-move, by proposing as an amend ment that all classes of MELBOURNE EXHIBITIONS: I. 1S54 ; 2. 1SS6; 3. l8j 465"], [488, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 466 property should take an equal share in supporting the burden of the State, and by adding a strong condemnation of Berry for not so arranging his budget scheme as to lighten some of those Customs duties which pressed with undue severity on the poorer classes. Some little intriguing went on, and Berry's Ministry made a stout effort by every contrivance they could devise to avoid so sudden a collapse of their power ; but it was all in vain, for McCulloch carried his amendment by thirty-nine to thirty-four. Berry asked for a dissolution from the Acting-Governor, Sir William Stawell, who filled that office during a year's leave of absence granted to Sir George Bowen. Stawell refused, and Berry resigned, protesting however that the people were with him in his policy. McCulloch then gathered a small, but efficient Ministry, out of the more moderate of the free-trade and the more moderate of the protectionist party. He himself was Treasurer ; Macpherson became Chief Secretary ; Kerferd, Attorney-General ; Gillies, Commissioner of Lands ; Robert Ramsay\u2014 a man of much ability and of a genial influence in the House, by reason of his hearty and obliging ways \u2014 took charge of the Education department ; John Madden, a prominent barrister, who, like Ramsay, had been educated at the Melbourne University, took the office of Minister of Justice. McLellan at the Mining department, R. S. Anderson at the head of the Customs, and Joseph Jones as Commissioner of Railways completed as strong a Government as Victoria had yet seen. Yet the amount of business it carried through was but slight, for Berry's party, indignant that Stawell had refused them the appeal they asked for to the constituencies, resolved to hamper the business of the Assembly. Then began to be heard that metaphor so often employed in the colony. Stonewall Jackson, the hero of so many fights in the American civil war, had gained that appellation from his habit of setting up his troops like a stonewall that would not move, but presented an imperturbable front with the stolid resolution of reckless braver)'. The popular party in the Assembly likened themselves to the immoveablc brigade that had defied all the Federal efforts at Bull's Run. Hence came the term to \" stonewall,\" the minority being resolute in obstructing all business till a dissolution was granted. On 20th January 1876 the feeling of the Assembly was taken as to whether it desired a dissolution or not ; the decision was carried by eight votes against the views of Berry's party. After a week of protracted obstruction, McCulloch, finding the business of the country at a standstill, moved that during the remainder of the session Government business be called on not later than five o'clock each evening. An all-night sitting ensued. Members made themselves as comfortable as they could, while Berry's party, each in turn, talked as long as their lungs and their throats could hold out; so morning came, and still the Ministerial party were there in relays to hear the exhilarating eloquence of their opponents. At eleven o'clock in the forenoon all the members of Berry's following had spoken ; they could not speak twice ; the opposition came to an end ; the resolution was passed, but matters were little mended ; when Government business did come on at five o'clock it was only to meet the fervid eloquence of orators to whom hours were nothing, and days very little. McCulloch therefore moved a step further. He proposed that during the rest of the session it would be competent, at any point of the debate, for a member to move that \" the question be now put,\" and that thereupon, if the motion were carried, it should be the duty of the Speaker to put the motion without further debate. This was nick-named the \" iron-hand '' resolution, and, of course, met with violent opposition. This time the sitting was prolonged for two days and two nights. For forty-eight wear)' hours did the Ministerial party relieve"], [489, "THE ERA OF MANUFACTURES.\u2014 187s TO 1880. 467 each other in turn so as to maintain a quorum, and for forty-eight hours did the Opposition descant on a perfect cyclop\u00e6dia of subjects. The Speaker, who was occasionally relieved, spent his time in calling them back to the subject. They came back with cheerful alacrity ; but wandered off again, always glad of being called to order, inasmuch as that monotonous process gave them a rest and consumed time. But the stonewall party after all was the first tired out, and the iron-hand resolution came into force for the session by a majority of forty-one to twenty. But even when the obstructionists were silenced, McCulloch had a troubled course to steer. There had of late years been a growing expensiveness of the machinery of government. The revenue no doubt had steadily increased, the average increase each year for the preceding four years having been \u00a3148,000, but the departments had grown in costliness at a much greater rate ; patronage had added too many men, and improved too many salaries, so that the increase of expenditure during the same period had amounted to \u00a3230,000 a-year. This process, continued for some time, had altered the small but healthy balance that used to be the rule into ominous deficits, repeated year after year. McCulloch had to put the finances in order. He proposed five new classes of taxation \u2014 a bank-note duty, a duty on wills and bequests, a land tax, a property tax, and an income tax. These were all new burdens to be laid on property, and in so far were popular measures, but when all the details came to be discussed of the mode of levying an income tax, of the elaborate provisions for acquiring a knowledge of a man's business affairs' and of the suspicious attitude which the State was to take up in relation to each man's statement of his income, the Ministerial party itself, after affirming the general desirability of an income tax, grew hesitant before the details of collection. The second reading of the bill was passed by a majority of only three votes. McCulloch had to expect the opposition of property holders in the Council, and without a more decided voice from the Assembly it was foolish to face the struggle. He withdrew the bill, and advised the Governor, Sir George Bowen, to close the session. It would be useless, he said, for him to resign, as the Opposition were in no condition to carry on the Government of the country. And so a stormy season came to an end \u2014 a season fruitful of hard words and evil insinuations ; violent scenes had occurred upon the floor of the House, and on one occasion a belligerent member had to be removed by the Sergeant-at-Arms. But at the beginning of 1877 the Assembly was dissolved by the expiration of its term of three years. The general elections justified the expectations of Berry and his party. However undignified they may have been, however open to the charges freely levelled against them of personal and disingenuous purposes, yet the voice of the country declared that theirs had been after all the policy that the constituencies approved of. The elections gave them about sixty members. The House had been by an Electoral Act of 1876 increased to eighty-six members. McCulloch had therefore no more than twenty-six. He did not wait to meet the triumphant majority, but resigned the day before the assembling of Parliament. The Radical party were now in power with a vengeance, and Berry formed a Cabinet of the stonewall party. W. C. Smith and J. B. Patterson, Peter Lalor and John Woods, Francis Longmore, R. Le Poer Trench, J. Macpherson Grant, Henry Cuthbert, and Sir Bryan OLoghlen formed a Ministry to whom their opponents, in contemptuous fashion, applied the nickname of the \" Berry crowd.\" Berry had a strong party, but it was weakened by the fact that he had had to make selections from among his followers for the various lucrative offices. Some of those who failed"], [490, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 468 to get positions of \u00a31000 or \u00a31200 a-year were consistent enough in their support for a time, if it were only for the sake of appearances, but an active few were prepared to seize the first excuse for taking offence. Berry's position was not one of unalloyed comfort. The Council was watching, with undisguised disgust, what it considered as a most revolutionary and suspicious combination of demagogues, which the country had chosen for its Assembly ; while that unanimity among his adherents which could alone carry him in safety through his troubles was only to be secured by constant watchfulness, interminable concessions, and the careful distribution of patronage. And now, with that undisciplined force, he had to keep his promise as to \" bursting up\" the large estates, and to provide once more for payment of members, the three years' term of that measure having just expired. But how he was to force that measure once more on the Council became a difficult matter to foresee. The Council was well aware that in the present condition of the Assembly payment of members was absolutely necessary to it. Without that provision for their subsistence a large number of Berry's followers must go back to their occupations ; so that the rejection of this measure seemed to be clearly the strongest means of defence that was left to the property-holders. First came the land tax proposals. They were clear and grimly business-like. Bern' proposed that all estates worth more than \u00a32500 were to pay 1 '4 per cent, upon their capital value each year. Commissioners were to be appointed who should classify all land under four heads, according to the quality of the soil. These men would have perfectly autocratic powers as to the valuation ; but though property-holders could appeal against the assessments, their appeal lay only to the commissioners themselves, who had the power to fine or imprison, for a period not exceeding three months, any one who declined to pay the tax demanded. The commissioners, by their own warrant of commitment to the nearest or most convenient gaol, could imprison a recalcitrant capitalist without conviction or any other formality. The bill was in the clearest manner a measure directed against the holders of property, and the Council received it in no pleasant frame of mind. But the recent declaration of the country had been very decisive, and some of the members pointed out that\" to reject this proposal would have all the appearance of a self-interested action on the part of the Council. The revenue was not sufficient to meet the expenditure; additional taxation was undoubtedly necessary ; members of the Council were mostly candid enough to allow that property did not bear its full share of the taxes ; it would be well to pass this bill, and fight out the struggle with this truculent Assembly rather in regard to the Payment of Members Bill, in which the Council was at least disinterested, than over the Land Tax Bill, as to which it was liable to the fiercest abuse of the popular party, who already accused it of the grossest selfishness. The bill was passed by a majority of sixteen to eleven. On the 27th of November, while the Assembly was sitting in Committee of Supply, Berry proposed that the sum of \u00a318,025 be placed on the estimates for the payment of members during the following year. A somewhat acrimonious debate ensued, some of the more moderate members asserting that a separate bill providing for the principle of payment of members should first be submitted to the Council, and that any premature appearance of coercion by inserting it in a money bill was to be deprecated. But the item was passed and placed on the Appropriation Bill by a majority of forty-three to twenty-six. Berry, however, yielded so far as to bring in a separate bill providing that the payment of members should be the law of the land for another period of three years. This bill was carried by forty-seven votes"], [491, "THE ERA OF MANUFACTURES.\u2014 1873 TO 1880. 469 to twenty-one, but on reaching the Council a week afterwards it was rejected by eighteen votes to eight. Two days later Berry sent up his Appropriation Bill containing the clause providing for payment of members. On the 20th of December the Council proceeded to read it a second time. Sargood, Campbell, Balfour, Simson, Jenner, Bear, Fraser, and others spoke in terms of strong indignation against the attempted coercion to which they were subjected. They lamented deeply the prospect of a third deadlock, but they were bound to reject an Appropriation Bill in which a question of general public policy was inserted in such a way as to deprive the Council of its right to a free and deliberate vote concerning the legislation of the country- The bill was rejected without a division. On that very evening Berry lectured his followers in the Assembly on the situation of affairs. In former days he had always condemned McCulloch for not taking such steps as would make the crisis short and sharp. Now he was prepared to carry out his own prescription. \" Either,\" he said, \" there must be condign punishment on the House that has dared to throw out an Appropriation Bill, or this House had better pass away and all power be left to the other chamber. The Council say that they will not be coerced, but I say they must be coerced.\" He concluded by moving the adjournment of the Assembly till the 5th February. What was to be the next movement of the Ministay ? This became a question of much concern. It was kept a profound secret. When the Executive Council met, Berry informed the Governor that the administration of public affairs was excessively costly ; that under any circumstances it must be reduced ; that a large crowd of civil servants must be dismissed who only met in the forenoon to discuss politics and read the daily papers, though they drew excellent salaries for doing work which was never done. The Governor, Sir George Bowen, consented to a general reduction. But Berry represented that with no Appropriation Bill, and consequently no funds, the reductions must be of a radical character, and relieve the State of the burden of a great number of heavy salaries which it needlessly paid. How far Berry would have gone of his own accord it is hard to say, but he was followed by a turbulent faction, who were imbued with the deepest hatred of the upper classes, and especially of those whom they considered as the sleek and over-fed heads of departments ; men who were supposed to be the servants of the public, but who were in reality its tyrants. There was perhaps here and there a civil service dignitary who gave some little colour to this accusation by his autocratic airs among subordinates, and his want of civility to those who had occasion to invade the office where he sat in state ; but for the larger part it was the pure imagination of men who felt a strong class-detestation ; and moreover, one or two of the Cabinet had private injuries to avenge on the heads of departments. On the 8th of January 1878, a day known in Victorian history as \"Black Wednesday,\" there appeared a Government Gazette announcing that the Governor-in-Council \u2014 that is, the Governor following the advice of the Ministry \u2014 had directed the removal of all the county court judges, the magistrates, the coroners, the Crown prosecutors, and wardens of goldfields, together with the heads of many public departments, and the chief officers of the Crown Lands, the Water Supply, the Customs, the Railways, the Roads, the Public Works, and the Penal departments. Man)- of these dismissals were serious breaches of public faith, and nearly the whole of the men thus summarily and without the faintest warning deprived of their means of subsistence were men of special acquirements and undoubted utility. The whole transaction was a piece of political spite, the Ministry hoping on the one hand to please the mob by the agreeable"], [492, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 470 spectacle of men at from \u00a3iooo to \u00a33000 a year turned adrift ; and on the other, feeling sure that a blow struck at these high officials would be felt as a blow throughout all the moneyed classes of the colony. Sir Georo-e Bowen took up the position that he must follow the advice of his constitutional advisers. He applied for instructions from London. In reply to his telegram there came another from Sir Michael Hicks-Beach, who was then Secretary of State for the Colonies. In this he was warned that though he must follow the advice of his Ministers, it should only be in strict compliance with the law, and that he ought to obtain legal advice if doubtful as to the interpretation of the law. Sir George Bowen became alarmed as to the dismissal of the judges, magistrates, and coroners ; it could not be legal to sweep away all provision for the administration of justice. At his demand many of these functionaries were reinstated ; but the same Gazette which announced that fact on the 25th January 1878, continued the list of proscriptions, and dismissed many of the officers of the Education and Treasury departments, and a number of others in the Railway department. The shock produced by an action so unusual, indeed, so unheard of in a British community, gave a check to the industrial energies of the country. When revolutionary proceedings are dreaded ; when the constitutional rulers of the country are found to be acting in a violent and vengeful fashion, capital draws back, enterprise is paralysed, and a state of anxious suspense is produced. In this critical state of affairs the Houses again met after the Christmas recess. On the second day Berry moved that all votes or grants passed in Committee of Supply should become legally available whenever such resolutions should be agreed to by the Legislative Assembly. This resolution practically affirmed that the supreme executive control of the State lay in the hands of the Assembly alone ; it was carried by fifty-two votes against twenty three. A week later the Assembly sent an address to the Queen in support of the action of Sir George Bowen ; it declared that if the Governor had endeavoured to support the opposition of a small minority against the wishes of the great bulk of the people, the result must have been to diminish the respect and devotion felt for the influence of the Crown. On the other hand the Council had forwarded a petition accusing him of acting with partiality, of consenting to a violation of the laws, and of acting in conjunction with a violent and reckless political party. But Sir Michael Hicks-Beach replied that if the quarrel should unhappily prove incapable of a speedy settlement it would be inexpedient for the Imperial Government and for the Queen's representative to take any part in it. On 5th March the Assembly passed an Appropriation Act for the purpose of authorising the Government to draw money for present needs; it was not intended to submit this bill to the Council, but to act upon the resolution previously agreed to. After a stormy debate, lasting two nights, the Assembly passed the Appropriation Bill by forty-eight to twelve, in spite of strong protests against the illegality of the intended action of the Ministry. Berry then laid before the Governor warrants to the extent of over \u00a3300,000 for his sio-nature. Sir George hesitated ; asked the advice of the law officers ; was informed by Trench, the Attorney- General, and by Sir Bryan OLoghlcn, that the proposed course was perfectly legal. He signed the warrants, and informed the Secretary for the Colonies that to have done otherwise would have been to bring him into hopeless collision with the representatives of the people of Victoria. It seemed clear to the Council that no active assistance would be received from the Imperial Government; it was equally clear that the great majority of the Assembly were"], [493, "THE ERA OF MANUFACTURES\u2014 1873 TO 1880. 471 prepared to support Berry in all he did, and that the country as a whole would support the Assembly in that course. Hence, on 21st March, when Cuthbert, as representative of the Berry Ministry in the Council, again brought in the bill for payment of members, and besought his fellow-members to pass it, and so put an end to all these evils and all this hostile feeling, the Council was inclined to give way, but to save its dignity it demanded as an equivalent that the obnoxious item be first struck out of the Appropriation Bill. To this a ready agreement was made, and after a stormy discussion the Council, on the 27th, passed the bill for payment of members without a division. Next day Berry re-introduced the former Appropriation Bill into the Assembly, omitting the clause that had caused so much contention. This roused the ire of some of his followers. A. T. Clark violently attacked him for having given way, and for having pusillanimously abandoned the right of the Assembly to put into the Appropriation Bill whatever it pleased ; thus he turned on Berry the same battery that Berry had plied on McCulloch only ten years before. But Berry maintained that a complete victory had been won. The Council had, in fact, surrendered at discretion, and had agreed to the will of the people as to the payment of members. The Appropriation Bill was duly passed, and on reaching the Council met with no opposition. McCulloch, from his place in the Assembly, asked Berry if it was intended, now that the trouble was all over, to reinstate the victims of \" Black Wednesday.\" The reply was that many of these officers could be easily dispensed with, and, as a matter of fact, while a certain number were restored to their offices, many others were supplanted by their juniors in the service, who took their positions at lower salaries. There were perhaps nearly 200 in all who were eventually dismissed. They received compensations to an aggregate of about \u00a345,000, while a few preferred annual pensions, amounting on the whole to \u00a33500 a year, so that in most cases there was no flagrant breach of public faith in the end. Indeed, had the change occurred in a calm, judicial manner, and been carried out by degrees, it would have been a blessing, for the civil service of Victoria was notoriously overgrown, and there could be no doubt that the heads of some departments were survivals from the times of the gold excitement, when men of no special qualifications were accepted for important posts, which they had kept, even though more capable men 1 id since been obtainable. But the action of the Ministers met with general condemnation among all but the more violently democratic of the people ; for the vindictive feeling which in large measure prompted it was so generally perceived that no belief was attached to their assurance that the advantage of the colony was the only object aimed at. Sir Michael Hicks-Beach, the new Secretary for the Colonies, commented somewhat sharply on Sir George Bowen's share in the business. Sir George replied, showing that the Berry Ministry, who were his constitutional advisers, had given him this advice, and that if he had refused to sign the dismissals he would have caused a resignation of the Ministry. But the Ministry had behind it the most powerful majority ever known in a colonial House of Assembly,- and behind that majority there was the most unequivocal support of the country. Bowen thought that to have tried to form a new ministry under these circumstances would have certainly set the people and the Crown in a position of mutual defiance. He had remonstrated with Berry, he said, and used his influence to mitigate the severity of the blow, but while the people and the Assembly were arrayed in Berry's favour he could do no more. Sir Michael Hicks-Beach did not admit the excuse to be fully valid. Sir George had a twenty-years' record of wise and skilful administration, but for once, in the opinion of the British Government, he had made a mistake. And yet, to the reader Vol. 1. 3 1"], [494, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 472 of the present day who skims the various despatches, the idea will occur that, as with old Sir Roger de Coverley, there is much to be said on both sides, and the course set forth by the Secretary for the Colonies, though it might have been successful, might on the other hand have led to worse mischief. At any rate, Bowen was able to announce in January 1879 that the natural result of such scenes was beginning to be evident. There was arising a general reaction against the violence that had been displayed on both sides, for the more fully Berry had been permitted to play his desperate game, and the more fully a few of the people's champions were permitted to lay bare the unseemly recesses of their motives, the more probable it became that a proper compromise would be effected. About this time the ranks of each of the two parties were strengthened by the accession of a man of learning and of literary standing. C. H. Pearson was well known in England as the historian of the Early and Middle Ages, as a writer of high culture, once the editor of the National Review. He had always, from his University days, found his sympathies running with the masses of the people, who, though their position has improved and is improving, are far from having yet obtained their just rights in a world where the ruling classes do not forget their own interests. Having come to Australia for the sake of his health, he became deeply interested in the struggle here maintained for that equitable claim which was acknowledged in no European country ; the right of the people, by a majority of its voters, whether poor or rich, to determine the legislation to which they were to be subject- Though head-master of the Presbyterian Ladies' College, a splendid establishment for female education, supported by the daughters of the wealthy, he delivered to a suburban audience a lecture that had all the charm of culture in its manner, but was certainly most demo cratic in its matter. Having thereupon received the remonstrances of the trustees of the institution, he withdrew, and devoted himself to the cause of the party with whose views he sympathised ; and in June 1878 was elected for Castlemaine. To Berry such an accession was most opportune, for his party, taken as a whole, suffered a good deal in public estimation from the want of that sweetness and light which culture ought to afford. Mr. Pearson made himself a host of enemies by abandoning the class to which by birth, attainments, and instincts he might be supposed to belong, and by taking his place, out of the most honourable motives, among a somewhat tnrbulent crew; sitting as Milton might be supposed to have sat among the regicides, rough men who felt they had rough work to do, and were not so tender of stomach as to be squeamish about doing it. his abilities to the defence of property, which was threatened with spoliation from a thought less, yet persistent democracy. Two months after Mr. Pearson had entered the Assembly, Dr. Hearn was elected to the Council, of which he soon took the lead, his penetrating intel lect and great knowledge, especially his widely-extended researches into constitutional law, giving him a commanding influence in a body where his special gifts were specially On the other side, the accession was William Edward Hearn. Twenty-five years had passed over his head since he had joined the Melbourne Uni versity as Professor of History and Political Economy. He had now a solid reputation as a philosophical writer; but he wished to enter the active arena. He desired to lend V\\ I1.LIAM EDWARD HEARN required."], [495, "THE ERA OF MANUFACTURES\u2014 1873 TO 1S80. 473 These champions were heartily greeted, for both sides were girding themselves up for a final conflict. It was perfectly clear that there must be some amendment of the constitution, for the last thirteen years had witnessed too many unhappy collisions between the branches of the Legislature. That was agreed upon, but the Council wanted to reform itself, while the Assembly proposed to take the necessary reformation in hand. On 10th July 1878 Sladen brought a bill for that purpose before the Council. The number of members was to be increased to forty-two, and the franchise was to be extended ; all holders of property to the extent of \u00a325 were to have a vote, but those who had more than \u00a350 would have two votes; those with more than \u00a3150 would have three votes. It was a foolish scheme under the circumstances, and the Council stripped it of all provisions for plural voting, leaving the franchise at \u00a325, thus doubling at once the number of qualified electors. Sladen also brought in a bill to give the Council power to amend a money bill, if they preferred so to do, rather than reject it altogether. This was passed by twenty-one votes to four, but when these two bills were sent down to the Assembly they were read a first time in silence and never again brought forward for discussion. Meanwhile Berry had, on the 17th of July, brought forward in the Assembly his rival scheme. He wished to alter only one clause of the Constitution Act, so as to deprive the Council of the power of rejecting a money bill, and so as to make a delay of one month in the passing of any such bill equivalent to a tacit assent. James Service, who was now by far the most influential of the Opposition, \u2014 a man of clear head, of great tact, of firm decision, and happy skill in debate, offered a strenuous resistance to a scheme which would destroy all the salutary check obtained from a second and perfectly independent chamber of legislature. Berry added tc his bill a provision that when disputes arose between the two Houses on an)' measure that was not clearly a money bill, if the Assembly twice passed it, and the Council twice rejected it, then it should be referred to a plebiscitum of the whole body of the people. This practice. so unlike anything in English history, did not take any great hold on popular favour, but the Assembly passed it by fifty to twenty-one, after a vigorous debate of eleven nights' duration. Here then were two rival bills on foot ; the Council would not look at the Assembly's ; the Assembly would not look at the Council's. On the motion of Sladen in the one House, and of Berry in the other, three members were appointed from each to hold a conference : Sladen, Anderson, and Hearn for the Council ; Berry, Pearson, and O'Loghlen for the Assembly. On 29th October the report of the conference was presented. The representatives of the Assembly demanded, as an essential, that the annual Appropriation Bill should, under no circumstances whatsoever, be rejected by the Council, and that with respect to all other bills a system of definite legislative finality should be provided. These were preliminaries that the representatives of the Council refused to grant. They, on their part, demanded that the Assembly should absolutely renounce its alleged right to \" tack\" extraneous matter to an Appropriation Bill. This concession was promptly refused. The delegates from the Assembly then proposed that the rival bills of reform be submitted to a plebiscitum of the people. The delegates of the Council absolutely declined to entertain the proposal. Berry therefore stated that there was no course left but to apply to the Imperial Government to settle the matter; and in November he moved for a vote of \u00a35000 to defray the expenses of three commissioners who should form an \"embassy\" to the Colonial Office in London. Service very pertinently wished to know what the embassy would do when it o-ot there. A few of the more frothy of the Berry party flourished their fists in the air, and said that if the British Government refused their request they would very well know what to do. A"], [496, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 474 debate extending through three long evenings of personal recriminations led to a vote of forty-six against twenty-two in favour of the \" embassy.\" This \"embassy\" idea was, in truth, an element in producing harmony, though not in the way Berry intended. It was so generally ridiculed, that Berry quickly lost favour with that generally important section of a community who are not guided by any very strong feeling, who do not take sides very heartily with either party, but are easily turned by passing circumstances to vote now with this, and now with that. They had given Berry a heavy majority because they wished for payment of members. Now they left him, and looking upon the \"embassy\" as a joke, purchased by thousands the clever caricatures which Punch produced weekly. The popular temper, formerly a little grim, now evaporated in a general laugh, and the projected departure of the three ambassadors was taken as a serious matter by only a minority of the people. Berry proposed that he should go himself, and that he should be accompanied by Sir Charles Gavan Duffy, now the Speaker of the Assembly, and by Mr. Pearson, whose personal reputation in London would clearly be of assistance. As the result of some intrigues, Duffy was compelled to decline the offer. No one else was chosen in his place. On Saturday, the 28th of December 1878, Berry and Pearson took leave of a large crowd of working men who had gathered at Spencer-street railway station to bid them farewell. Delegates from many of the trades unions waited on them with addresses, and so they departed, feeling tolerably certain of the allegiance of the artisans, but very doubtful as to the attitude of the other portions of the working classes. In London they were courteously received by Sir Michael Hicks-Beach, and frequent interviews took place at the Colonial Office. Sir Michael would have accorded them a more formal reception had they come as a joint deputation properly representative of all parties but he was of too judicial a character to commit himself to any public opinion on the strength of purely ex parse statements. He therefore talked the matter over at great length in private ; took the advice of his colleagues, and announced that it was the decision of the Imperial Government not to interfere. In his official reply to the address of the Assembly he stated that \" though fully recognising the confidence in the mother country evinced by the reference of so important a question for the counsel and aid of the Imperial Government, I still feel that circumstances do not yet justify any Imperial legislation for the amendment of the Constitution Act. It would be held to involve an admission that the great colony of Victoria was compelled to ask the Imperial Parliament to resume a power which, desiring to promote her welfare, the Imperial Government had voluntarily surrendered, and this because of a general want of the moderation and sagacity essential to the success of constitutional government.\" Sir Michael then in courteous, and indeed deferential language suggested some good advice to the contending parties, and such was the fruit of the embassy. Those who had been inclined to believe in it as a serious matter of great moment, now altered their minds, and there were few in Victoria who did not condemn the whole transaction as a mistake. The general feeling was that the colony had not reached such a critical condition that it could no longer manage its own affairs, and as Berry had left the colony with much ostentation, and had sent from London most fanciful accounts of his unqualified success, the publication of the official despatch was enjoyed with a somewhat mischievous pleasure as being a gentle mode of extinguishing a little piece of officious forwardness. Berry, immediately after his return to the colony, moved for leave to introduce a new"], [497, "THE ERA OF MANUFACTURES.- 1875 TO 1880 475 Reform Bill into the Assem bly. He made a lame effort to convince the country that the English Secretary for the Colonies had granted all that he really wanted. He now proposed that the Council should consist of nominee members, appointed by the Governor for ten years at a time ; that they should have no right to reject appropria tion bills; and that the final appeal on all matters should lie in a plebiscitum of the people. SIR GEORGE I*. BOWEN. The idea of a nominee Upper House had originated with Sir George Bowen, who thought that if it ceased to be elective it would occupy more fully the position held by the House of Lords; it would gain in dignity, but would lose in power; would acquire more social weight, yet more readily recognise the necessity of yielding to the popular wishes, as expressed in Assembly elections, than would a Council which claimed to be itself representative of the people. There was a long struggle, but eventually Berry carried the second reading by fifty to twenty-eight. Meanwhile Sladen also proposed a new Reform Bill, with elaborate provisions, which the Council altered so completely that he refused to recognise it any longer as his. Nevertheless, it was passed in its altered shape. Berry's bill, however, was fighting its way through the Assembly clause by clause, with an ever-diminishing majority. He obtained with difficulty a provision that the Assembly should have power to appropriate money on its own single authority. But reflecting on what they were doing, some members subsequently took alarm, while others, who on personal grounds were alienated from Berry, took this opportunity as a decent pretext for deserting him. Now, an amendment of the Constitution Act required an absolute majority of each House, and as there were eighty-six members in the Assembly forty- four votes would be required to make the resolution valid. Berry thought he could gather that number. But on the night of the division one more insubordinate member of his party gave signs of an intention to desert. Without him there would not be forty-four votes recorded. Fortunately this individual had spent a large portion of the evening in the refreshment-rooms, and, being a man occasionally given to excess in that manner, he was in a somewhat babe-like condition when the division was called. Supported between two of his former allies, he joined the side he had threatened to desert, and was about to be counted as a vote in their support, to the great exultation of the Berry party, when, all of a sudden, and without the smallest warning, another of their members crossed to the other side, leaving the votes but forty-three after all. A great deal of ingenuity was exercised in trying to prove that this number constituted an absolute majority, but arithmetic has no political leanings, and Berry was at length forced to acknowledge a defeat. He asked for a dissolution. There was a new governor in the colony. Sir George Bowen's period of office had expired during the course of the year. The Colonial Office had thought it unwise to extend it, and in February 1879 he had departed to take charge of the administration of the Mauritius. Five days later his successor, the Marquis of Normanby,"], [498, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 476 had arrived\u2014 a worthy gentleman who had never startled the world with any brilliant ability, but who brought to his office a fund of quiet, amiable good sense, and the experience gained in the government of Nova Scotia, of Queensland, and of New Zealand, as well as in his previous capacities, he having been four years a member of the House of Commons, and five years of the House of Lords. It was to him that Berry applied for a dissolution. After careful deliberation, he decided that the request should be granted, and this eventful Assembly terminated on the 9th February 1880. Then came the bustle of a general election. It was noticeable that there was less of bitterness than formerly. The people had been weaned of their excessive affection for some of their idols, while the wealthier classes and the supporters of the Council in general, had begun to feel that these agitations had injured trade and crippled enterprise, and they feared that if the opposition of the Council were stupidly prolonged, the credit of the colony might permanently suffer. The result of the elections was in effect a compromise. Berry had thirty-seven followers but Service had thirty-five, the remaining fourteen formed a phalanx of unknown intentions. A large part of it consisted of Catholic members who avowedly proposed to secure certain His bill was only a modifi cation of that already agreed to by the Council. If it had passed the Assembly it would have been received as an old friend in the Upper House, but after twelve nights' debate Service could secure only six votes in ad dition to the thirty-five of his party. The Opposition mustered forty-three in all, and Service asked for a dis solution, which took place on the 29th June, the Assembly being then onlysix weeks old. educational concessions to their denomination by the simple process of selling their support to either one or the other of the parties as an equivalent for these concessions. This knot of Irishmen was led by Sir John O'Shanassy, who of fered their vote to Service. He refused to buy it at the price demanded, and, as a consequence, when he brought up his own Consti tution Amendment Act in May 1880, it was rejected. THE HON. JAMES SERVICE Again there was the popular ferment of a general election, Service and his party striving to their utmost to secure an absolute majority for the bill which would bring peace. But the constituencies were not in favour of it, and the supporters of Berry were found to be rather more numerous in the new House than in the old. Service lost no time in resigning, and Berry returned to office, from which he had been absent only five months. With him came W. M. K. Vale as the lawyer of the party, and W. C. Smith as Minister of Education ; and J. B. Paterson, and H. R. Williams, and A. T. Clark, and G. D. Langridge, and Richard Richardson ; while C. H. Pearson joined the Cabinet, though without office. There was a certain fitness and justice in the return of Berry to power at that time, for the colony was on the eve of the opening of its first great International Exhibition, and as Berry and his Ministry had originated, and to a large extent carried out this great undertaking, it would have been a matter for regret had they not had the satisfaction of presiding over the fruition of their own labours. The idea of such an undertaking had been first suggested by the Victorian commission at the Paris Exhibition of 1878. At their instigation Berry had, in"], [499, "THE ERA OF MANUFACTURES\u2014 1873 TO 1880. 477 1877, introduced a bill for the purpose; the Assembly readily agreed to it. But this was one of the eighty bills which Berry declared had been rejected by the Council in about twenty years. The form of the preamble gave offence to the Council, which regarded the whole proposition as a piece of officious self-importance on the part of the Berry faction. But the enormous success of the Paris Exposition, and the great educational value of such a display when visited by sixteen millions of people, induced the Victorian commissioners to press the point, and as Sydney was then finding every encouragement for her exhibition, to be held in 1879, Berry again brought forward a bill for an exhibition to be held in 1880. In November 1878 this bill was passed. A large and influential commission was appointed, with Sir William J. Clarke, the son of W. J. T. Clarke, as its president. Active operations were begum and on 19th February 1879, just a week before his departure, Sir George Bowen, in the presence of 10,000 persons, laid the foundation-stone of a fine building, which eventually raised its handsome dome from out the centre of the Carlton Gardens. This structure cost, in all, \u00a3246,000, and as a large part of it was permanent it formed a noble addition to the public buildings of the city. In the meantime, with its annexes, it provided floor space of about 22 acres, whereon no less than 13,000 exhibitors placed 32,000 separate exhibits. On the 1st of October 1880 all was ready, and the greatest gathering Victoria had ever witnessed filled the vast hall, and made the echoes ring far up in the heights of the lofty cupola as the Governor's procession entered by the great central archway. The Marquis of Normanby was accompanied by the Governors of the adjoining colonies. A guard of honour, consisting of battalions of volunteers, with sailors from the warships in the Bay ; a procession of trades unions and fire brigades, with no less than nine brass bands at intervals in the long array ; the fluttering of banners and the firing of cannon in the Bay, all gave a joyful emphasis to the 1st of October. Within the building, when the vice-regal party took its station upon the canopied dais, the vast sea of faces, fringed by the side exhibits of the central hall, most of them English manufactures of exquisite appearance ; the great chorus, rising tier on tier upon a spacious gallery at one end, 500 ladies all in spotless white, the sopranos distinguished by ribbons of blue, the contraltos of red, while nearly as many male singers occupied the other half of the gallery, the great orchestra that gathered in front of them, and the vast organ that raised its decorated pipes behind them up to the lofty roof, all filled the Victorians with a worthy pride in the changes that forty-five years had seen in the aspect of their country. The words of His Excellency were certainly not heard by many of the assemblage, but the same feeling was in ten thousand minds when he said, \" It must be a source of legitimate pride to the people of Victoria that a colony whose territory was an unknown land less than half a century a\u00b0-o has been enabled by the wealth of its natural resources, the wisdom of its laws, and the enterprise, intelligence, and industry of its population, to bring to a successful completion this \"rand project.\" All this change in much less than a lifetime ! And indeed it was only just of late that the earliest settler had passed away. Edward Henty, on the 14th August 187S, had died in his suburban mansion after a life of 69 years, of which forty-four had been spent in Victoria. When the opening cantata was sung, and the doors thrown open, the long vista of the \" Avenue of Nations \" revealed a scene of exhilarating magnificence. Great Britain, France, Germany, Austria, Belgium, Holland, Italy, Switzerland, Denmark, Russia, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, all contributed to the mass of the gay effect\u2014 some of them at lavish expense, and with delightful good taste. The 'United States made a brilliant display, and s.. did India; and other colonies lent their aid\u2014 New South Wales, Queensland, South"], [500, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLLS: PAST AND PRESENT. 478 Australia, Tasmania, Western Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, Cape Colony, the Straits Settlements, Ceylon, Mauritius, and the South Sea Islands ; and the Japanese indicated their friendly feeling and their extraordinary skill in a charming court of their own. The grounds were laid out in avenues and parterres, with ponds and fountains, and numerous kiosks here and there, with fluttering pennons, which made the whole a scene of gaiety such as Victoria had not yet known, and such as had never been equalled in the southern hemisphere, save by the Sydney Exhibition of the previous year. The display was kept open for seven months, during which time 1,330,000 visits were made to it \u2014 a number more than half as large again as the total population of the colony. The exhibition had an enormous influence upon the manufactures of Victoria. In the first place it forced upon the public attention the fact that the colony had become emphatically a manufacturing community, and it destroyed the old inclination to sneer at goods when known to be of colonial manufacture. The total value of the products of Victorian factories now exceeded \u00a313,000,000 per annum, and it became clear that in many departments the colonial workmen could hold their own for excellence and cheapness against any competitors. On the other hand, it revealed to the manufacturers where their weaknesses lay, and it was a most interesting feature to observe the intelligent workman spending his holiday in a careful and elaborate investigation of the specialties and novelties of design, of material, and of process which gave to goods of foreign manufacture some peculiar excellence of whose existence he had perhaps not formerly been aware. In short, when the commissioners reported to Parliament the completion and the result of their labours, there was a universal readiness to endorse their statement \" that the commercial, social, and educational results of the exhibition have been most satisfactory ; that it has taught the people of the colony much of which they were previously ignorant ; and that it will make Australia better known throughout the world.\" It did in truth make it better known throughout the world, and it gave Victoria a distinct standing as a manufacturing nation, letting that fact be known to her own people, to the neighbouring colonies, and to foreign countries, and thus boldly and permanently recording the establishment of her manufacturing era.

CHAPTER XXV IRecent {Times*\u2014 1880 to isss I Tfl^ HE return of Berry to power in August 1880 had indicated beyond a doubt that j^lfnr the country was prepared to support the Assembly to the end in its struggle with tin- Council Berry had parti}* lost his own personal popularity, but he was still maintained in office as the necessary agent of the work the people were determined, should be done. And the general temper of the Assembly was still somewhat grim. Its first action was to elect as its Speaker Peter Lalor, so that he who twenty-six years before had cheered a band of insurgent miners from the summit of that heap of palisades, now sat in one-armed dignity in a chair of State, beneath a solemn wig and surrounded by the insignia of a grave and responsible office. No time was lost ere the Assembly made itself ready for the struggle. The Payment of Members Bill had expired. It must be renewed. For that purpose Berry again carried a measure to provide for the payment of \u00a3300 a-year for each member of both Houses of Legislature. But the Council was tired of the strife ; the opening of the Exhibition was close at hand, and the continuance of bitter feeling would mar its prospects. They indicated their willingness to pass the bill in so far as it related to the .Assembly, but as for themselves the}* declined the money. As the}- could not alter the bill they suggested a conference in order to arrange for the division of the bill into two : one providing for payment of members of the Assembly, the other for payment of members of the Council. On the day Vol. I. i J"], [502, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 480 before the opening of the Exhibition, Berry agreed to that proposal. At the conference the bill was divided as required ; of the two bills sent up, the Council passed the one and rejected the other. Thus, in regard to this long-vexed question, peace seemed to be at last secured by a suitable compromise. But at the beginning of 1881 Berry brought forward that other contention of long-standing\u2014 the reform of the Council. He confessed that the country had been adverse to his previous proposals ; but it had been equally adverse to those of Mr. Service. He therefore now suggested an intermediate scheme. He wished that every ratepayer should have a vote for the Council, that the existing Council should be dissolved with the Assembly, and that both bodies should make a fresh start together\u2014 the one as a representative of all the adult men, the other as the representative of all the ratepayers of the colony. He wished the Council to be elected by thirty single electorates, and desired to abolish all property qualifications for members. After six nights of debate this measure was agreed to in the Assembly by forty-eight votes to twenty-seven. It came before the Council, which unanimously agreed to the second reading ; but subsequently, in committee, altered the number of provinces from thirty to fourteen, but provided three members for each province, so as to make a total of forty-two ; it also inserted a property qualification for members, amounting to \u00a3150 of freehold, and limited the suffrage to those who paid rates on freeholds worth \u00a310 a year, and tenants whose yearly rental was \u00a325. When it came back to the Assembly Berry wished the bill to be laid aside ; but his objections were trivial ; there seemed to be no reason for prolonging the strife ; and on the motion of Sir Bryan O'Loghlen it was agreed to invite the Council to a conference. This was done and a compromise was effected, the property qualification of members of the Council being reduced to a hundred pounds' worth of real estate. In this form both Houses agreed to the bill, and so terminated a tedious dispute, the longest ever known to have occurred between any two Houses of the same Parliament. It had been bitter, but it had had its lessons. It furnished so many precedents of value to other countries that Alpheus Todd, the leading historian of Parliamentary institutions, has told the story with abundant details, occupying no less than sixty pages of his latest work in recounting and explaining the points on which it offers instruction. Berry's Ministry did not prolong its existence to the full term of a year. He had not shown a great deal of prudence in his latter management of the Assembly, and his party began to be torn by internal dissensions. On the 1st of July 1881 Sir Bryan O'Loghlen, his former ally, carried against him a vote of want of confidence. Berry applied to the Marquis of Normanby for a dissolution. It was refused, much to his disgust. He asserted that it was against constitutional practice to deny a dissolution to a Ministry which asked for it. The Governor repudiated any such doctrine, and replied that if such a practice became obligatory, the independence of parliaments would be lamentably diminished. Berry resigned, and Sir Bryan took his place. The country was tired of political commotion, and welcomed with pleasure a coalition Ministry, even though it was by no means composed of the most brilliant statesmen. None of the leaders on either side would join it ; yet it contained a fair amount of ability, and united in a determination to secure for the colony a policy which the new Premier announced as \"Peace, Progress, and Prosperity.\" Sir Bryan himself took the office of Attorney-General, Macpherson Grant became Chief Secretary; Thomas Bent took charge of the Railway department; F. S. Dobson became Solicitor-General; J. II. Graves, Commissioner of Customs; Charles Young, Minister of Agriculture ; Henry Bolton, Postmaster-General ; and Robert Burrowes, Minister of"], [503, "RECENT TIMES.\u2014 1880 TO 1888. 481 Mines. David Gaunson at first joined the Cabinet, but when he presented himself for re-election his constituents rejected him, and he was replaced in the Ministry by Walter Madden. This period, which saw the termination of a conflict arising mainly out of the refinements of a high degree of civilisation, saw also the extinction of a state of things that certainly belonged to a much more primitive form of society. Though Victoria is in the main well settled, yet it contains considerable tracts which even in the present day have scarcely been traversed by man ; and, indeed, in the heart of some of her timber-clad ranges, far within the long waves of granite cliffs and tangled forests, there are still places that have never, so far as is known, received the pressure of a human foot. So long as these fastnesses promised a tolerable security to the outlaw, there was always a probability that the old practice of bushranging would linger on. In former times bushranging was the natural result of the fact that large numbers of convicts were kept under restraint in a country which contained great wildernesses to which they might escape. In Victoria, however, the practice originated rather in the emulation of the outlaws of more primitive times ; the man who was of criminal instincts preferred to take to the wild country with horse and rifle rather than pick pockets or plunder houses by night in the city. There were numerous instances of bushranging in the times immediately subsequent to the gold discovery. One or two of these cases have been already mentioned. But the first who contrived to somewhat captivate the public fancy by throwing an air of romance about his exploits was Power, who flourished in 1868 and 1869. He haunted the wild and picturesque country on the Dividing Range at the head of the tributaries of the Ovens. There, where The Cobbler and Mount Howitt, and a dozen other giants of over 5000 feet, rear their lonely heads out of leagues and leagues of forest, he found a secure retreat, whence he issued sometimes on the Mansfield side, sometimes towards Beechworth. In August 1869 he went the length of stopping the mail coach from Beechworth to Buckland, and robbing all its passengers. In addition, he plundered all whom he met on the road. So cool were his robberies, so mysterious his movements, that he held the whole north-eastern district in alarm, and the Government offered a reward of \u00a3500 for his capture. Several troopers, led by a black-tracker, followed him for three days up the intricate valley of the King River, and surprised him far within the solitudes, resting under his rude hut of boughs. He was sentenced to a long term of imprisonment. But by far the most exciting career of this kind was that of the Kelly gang, which for two years remained at large \u2014 a band of four outlaws, stained with blood, and reckless in their defiance. In 1870, when Ned Kelly was twenty-two years of age, he had been arrested on suspicion of having been in collusion with Power, but the evidence as to his identity being doubtful, he had been discharged. His house was the rendezvous, however, for all the criminally disposed persons of the district, and he and his brother Dan took a share in frequent unlawful adventures. In 1874 Ned Kelly was discharged from Pentridge gaol for receiving a stolen horse, and in the early part of 1878 Dan was discharged from Beechworth gaol after a three months' sentence. Yet, during the course of this latter year, it became necessary to issue a warrant against them both for horse-stealing. A constable went out to the house, where they lived with their mother and sisters, in order to execute the warrant. Ned Kelly shot him, and as he was lying with a shattered arm, the other inmates of the cottage beat him unmercifully. The two brothers then escaped, and, along with two companions, named Byrne and Hart, concealed themselves in the pathless wilds up among the Dividing Ranges, about twenty miles"], [504, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 482 from Mansfield. These had been the haunts of Power nine years before, and away in deep silent recesses, where a dozen rivers tumbled down from their rocky sources, they could not be pursued unless with extreme difficulty, while they, with so many confederates among the settled districts, could steal out to the edge of the forest for supplies as soon as the police were reported to be out of the way. The Government offered a reward for their capture, and four mounted troopers went out in pursuit. On Saturday, the 26th of October 1878, they came upon the spot where the four outlaws were encamped in a district of mighty trees and tangled thickets. But on that spring morning they stumbled unawares into a trap where the robbers were watching, and three of the troopers were killed by the well-practised aim of the gang. The fourth had a narrow escape, but spurring his horse among whizzing shot, he galloped out of danger to report the death of his comrades. The Government offered rewards of \u00a3200 each for the desperadoes, and nearly a hundred police went out to scour the ranges ; but so wild were these wooded valleys, and so spacious the extent of the uninhabited country, that the gang contrived to keep out of the way, though the police from time to time found indications that they were in communication with people settled in the Mansfield district. Suddenly, on the 8th December, the four bushrangers, well armed and well mounted, appeared at a station only three miles from Euroa, a small town on the main line of railway, nearly thirty miles on the other side of Mansfield. They imprisoned together in one room all the inmates of the dwelling, nearly twenty in number, during a whole night. Next day, while two remained to mount guard oyer the prisoners, the other two sallied out, and having cut the telegraph wires on both sides of Euroa, entered the National Bank in that township. Having presented their revolvers at the manager and his clerk, and compelled them to surrender, they gathered up \u00a31900, and marched off the two bankers with several others to share the imprisonment of the party at the station three miles away. The four robbers having calmly packed and arranged all their booty, departed at nine o'clock in the evening, leaving the people still locked in the room, and threatening that any one caught leaving it before eleven o'clock would be shot. This was only a trick, for without delay they rode off to the ranges with their plunder, and were not again heard of for two months. When next their proceedings were . reported they were a hundred miles away ; across the Murray and in New South Wales. They entered the thriving town of Jerilderie, a place with two hundred inhabitants, with several hotels, and two or three banks. It was Saturday night a quiet summer evening; they surprised the two policemen of the place, who were enjoyino- their leisure, little expecting such visitors ; they locked them up in their own lock-up. The telegraph clerks were then surprised and compelled to cut their wires, when they also were thrust into the lock-up. Such of the townspeople as happened to be in the way were covered with fire-arms and compelled to surrender, when they also were incarcerated. It was easy, by explaining that the first man who gave the least alarm would be shot dead upon the spot, to carry out all these operations in silence. And then the Bank of New South Wales was invaded, and, in a scattered country township, on a peaceful Sunday morning, they plundered it at their leisure. They obtained \u00a32000, and when they left the town none of the inhabitants, save those locked up, knew of the scene that had been enacted. The boldness, the daring, the adroitness, the mystery of their proceedings, kept a wide district in alarm, and as nothing was heard of them for three months, even though police in parties of six, and ten, and twenty were traversing the country on all sides, the public suspense"], [505, "RECENT TIMES.\u2014 1880 TO 1888. 483 became intolerable. In these quiet little country towns, no matter how far away, no one knew the moment when he was to be called on to stand, and to see a gun-barrel pointing at him with an evil-looking eye at the other end of it. It was not till 26th June 1880 that they were again heard of. There was a man called Sherritt, who had once been their ally, but who had turned informer. To his house, about twenty miles from Beechworth, they proceeded There were four constables concealed in it at that time. Sherritt was induced by a stratagem to come outside, but as soon as he passed the door he was shot dead. It was a dark night, and the robbers from the obscurity taunted the police, and called on them to come out and fight, but the latter knew that they would have been picked off as soon as THE CAPTURE OF NED KELLY THE BUSHRANGER they showed themselves by men who were excellent marksmen, and who were themselves invisible. They kept within the hut, and the gang made off. A special train, with a force of troopers, was despatched from Melbourne to the nearest station. It started on a Sunday night, and through a frosty midnight, with a full moon, sped on its way to Benalla. At that point an engine was employed to go as pilot about half a-mile in front, there being every reason to fear that the gang might have placed obstructions on the line. This turned out to be a very wise precaution, for in fact the next station, at the little township of Glenrowan, was then in the possession of the robbers, who had chosen a particularly awkward curve on the railway just beyond the station, and there caused the rails to be torn up, so as to hurl the train over an embankment. They had surprised the stationmaster at three o'clock on a Sunday morning, and compelled him to get"], [506, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 484 up out of bed and gather some labourers for the purpose of taking up the rails. The men were got, and the necessary tools were gathered ; the work was done while the gang stood sentry over the labourers with loaded rifles. Ned Kelly then hoisted at the station the \" all right\" signal for the special train which he knew to be on its way filled with constables. He next gathered all his prisoners, seventeen in number, into the Glenrowan Hotel, and waited for the wrecking of the train, proposing to take a wide revenge on the police by shooting any that should fail to perish in the accident. But the schoolmaster of Glenrowan had contrived to escape, and hurrying out upon the line he gave the warning to the pilot engine. The lights in the train were extinguished, and it was drawn gently up to the platform, where the horses were landed ; while the police were getting the animals ready, the sound of a shot rang out through the frosty air. It was the Glenrowan policeman, who had escaped from imprisonment, and after whom the gang were firing. It was still quite dark on a frosty winter's morning as the police advanced upon the weatherboard building called the Glenrowan Hotel, wherein the prisoners were cooped up with the gang in charge of them. A shot fired by Ned Kelly took effect in the wrist of Superintendent Hare, but the police replied with a volley, and not till then was it known by the screams within that the place was packed with women and children, the total number of prisoners being now about forty. Two women appeared, hysterically screaming and shouting that the police had shot two children within. Inspector Hare called on the women and children to come away, but the gang threatened to shoot any one that tried to leave. One or two succeeded in slipping out, and then a brisk firing began both from within the house and from without. But the police were hampered by the knowledge that so many innocent persons were within. At six o'clock another train arrived with sixteen troopers. Just before their appearance the attacking party had poured a heavy volley into the building. Byrne was at that moment raising a glass of whisky to his mouth, having rested for a moment from the incessant labour of firing; a ball struck him in the groin, and he was carried to the rear to die. Soon after Ned Kelly emerged upon the open. His chest, back, and sides were protected by plates of quarter-inch iron, while his head was encased in a great square-shaped helmet, with holes left for his eyes. These had been made for him out of plough-shares by a friendly blacksmith, and though nine constables poured shot after shot into him he still held his ground, and fired at them point blank with his pistol. It was only when a bullet was put into each of his legs that he fell, and then he struggled to keep up his firing, till a rush was made, and he was overpowered. Meantime desultory firing was kept up all forenoon from the hotel. It was not till midday that the prisoners made a rush and got away from the hotel ; then the two desperadoes kept well in hiding but delivered from time to time an occasional shot ; the police were forbidden by their officers to make a charge, for the robbers would certainly have taken three or four lives ere a policeman could have reached the building. But a single constable, creeping up cautiously from the rear, succeeded in setting fire to the hotel. At the same time the police poured a simultaneous volley into the place where the robbers seemed to be. As the flames rolled up the cry arose that there was an old man lying wounded within the house ; he had been kept there as a prisoner, had been shot by the police, and had been unable to escape. A Catholic priest volunteered to enter and carry him out. As he entered, some of the police made a rush to support him, but there was no need for further fight. Those who carried the wounded old man saw the two remaining outlaws stretched in death upon the wooden floor, and the flames"], [507, "RECENT TIMES.- 1 8 So TO 1 888. 485 already licking their livid features. They were both cased, like Ned Kelly, in iron armour, which seems to have been efficient for the purpose ; no less than seventeen bullet marks were found upon that which Ned Kelly wore. Three of the outlaws were slain in the conflict, and their leader was captured, but unfortunately two of the persons accidentally shot subsequently died ; the Government, so far as it could make restitution in money, did its best to provide compensation. Ned Kelly was tried and sentenced to death, and with his execution on nth November 1880, the long story of bushranging in Victoria comes to an abrupt and terrible end. Such occurrences had ceased to be in any way characteristic of the colony. They were an anachronism \u2014 a survival from a ruder state during earlier days. They were but an excrescence in a period of extraordinary, and yet orderly progress, for the colony had, indeed, entered into that era of \" Peace, Progress, and Prosperity \" promised by Sir Bryan O'Loghlen. That Minister, without any pronounced ability, and with no very powerful combination of colleagues, contrived, by the exercise of a good-humoured forbearance and the persistent avoidance of all disputed points, to prolong the existence of his Cabinet to a term of nearly two years. But Sir Bryan's position was only tenable so long as the two extreme parties remained unreconciled. Now, Berry and Service, as well as their followers, had seen, by the unmistakable prosperity of the last year or two, that in a policy of peace, and useful social legislation, lay the most hopeful prospect for the colony. They perceived clearly enough that the people had become charmed with the new and money-making condition of affairs. They therefore came to an understanding among themselves, and as Sir Bryan seemed in rather a confused condition in regard to the management of the finances, he being not only Attorney-General but also Treasurer, an office for which he was scarcely qualified, they easily found an opportunity of tripping him up. On the 8th of March 1883 a new and stronger coalition Alinistry was formed. Service was the Premier, and he filled the office of Treasurer; Graham Berry was the Chief Secretary; Kerferd was Attorney-General; and R. S. Anderson was Minister of Justice; Gillies was Commissioner of Railways; Sargood was Minister of Defence; A. L. Tucker was President of the Board of Land and Works; and J. F. Lcvien was Minister of Alines; G. D. Langridge became Commissioner of Customs, and James Campbell Postmaster-General. One of the most notable of the Cabinet was Alfred Deakin, a young man, Victorian by birth, a barrister by training, and remarked during his college career as a speaker of singular fluency in the University debating club. He had never obtained any practice to speak of as a barrister, for he had al most immediately connected himself with the Age office as a leader-writer, and there had graduated in the politics of the popular party. After an unsuccessful attempt to enter Parliament, he made a second effort, and secured a seat in the Assembly. In his maiden speech he had indica ted the advent of a genuine orator; florid and hasty per haps when compared with the calm and dignified eloquence of Higinbotham, or the homely reasonableness that made the speeches of Service both interesting and convinc ing. But Deakin was clearly possessed of the power to move an audience by an easy flow of words and that indescribably sympathetic THE HON. ALFKEU DEAKIN"], [508, "486 VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. something which gives the orator a hold on the ears and the hearts of his hearers. As a speaker he made his mark at once, and people were curious to know how he would figure as a statesman. He took the position of Commissioner of Public Works, and likewise the office of Commissioner of Water Supply. The new Ministry settled down to promote the continuance of the peace, progress, and prosperity that had come with the coalition of parties, and after a year of these quiet times, the colony witnessed the departure of the Marquis of Normanby on the 18th of April 1884. His quiet, good-humoured, unostentatious ways had secured him the popular goodwill, and the people regretted to see no more his rosy and jolly face as he drove his four-in-hand in and out among- the streets of the suburbs. In his place, on July iSth 1884, came Sir Henry Brougham Loch, a soldier whose name was well known m connection with dangerous .services performed in the Chinese war. He had been for many years Governor of the Isle of Man, and therefore brought with him an abundant experience. His appearance and his manner made a most favourable impression, as of one eminently manly and candid-minded ; one who would be resolute enough in the time of duty but conciliatory to all classes, so long as the interests of the community could be promoted by' a cheerful and kindly activity. The advent of Lady Loch was felt as a blessing by the charitable organisations of Melbourne, and as she assumed for her special mission the encouragement of culture in the colon}-, and endeavoured to leaven with a higher ideal in music and in art the somewhat commonplace tastes that must inevitably prevail to a large extent"], [509, "RECENT TIMES.\u2014 1880 TO 1888. 487 among the wealthier classes in a self-made colony, her influence has been distincly felt in the recent history of Victoria ; though, perhaps, it will not be possible yet awhile to realise its full extent. The Ministry of Service and Berry remained in office for three years, and occupied itself mainly in social legislation of various forms. One of the earliest subjects of its attention was the storage of water and the means of irrigating those drier plains of the colony where the soil was admirably adapted for wheat-growing, but where the efforts of the farmers were paralysed by the smallness of the rainfall, or its complete absence at the season when water was absolutely necessary to the crops. As a preliminary, Deakin was sent, at the end of 1884, as a special commissioner to California, to report on the systems there adopted. His mission was eminently successful ; he compiled an instructive report ; a royal commission was appointed to deal with the whole question ; and as the practical result of its labours, a bill was passed at the end of 1886 which made provision for the irrigation of any district whenever the farmers chose to combine and comply with certain conditions. In any district an Irrigation Trust could be formed ; and to it would be given the control of the rivers and all the water supplies of that district. For the construction of the works that would be necessary to conserve, to pump, to distribute the waters dealt with, the trust could borrow money from the Government at an increase of one-half per cent, more than the rate paid by the colony for its public loans. The trust which thus irrigated its district could levy an assessment on the farmers of the district. But the State held in its own hands the control of such river-sources as did not belong to any one district, but partook of a national character. In these places national works were to be undertaken, but only on condition that the chief engineer of the Water Supply department reported that the payments to be made by the several trusts for the waters derived from these national works would be sufficient to pay a reasonable interest on the money expended in their construction. It was therefore, on a large scale, a system of helping the farmers to help themselves, and it was generally hailed as a most important stage in the development of the colony's agricultural resources. This measure was mainly conducted to a successful issue by Alfred Deakin, but it was in a sympathetic Assembly, anxious to efface the recollection of times of quarrel by useful legislation. In 1886 James Service resigned the Premiership. There had been no adverse vote, but he was tired of the cares of office ; at sixty-three years of age he sought a rest, and as there was nothing in prospect that would require the hand of a strong party leader he withdrew to recruit his health in a tour through Europe. Graham Berry was a year older, and he, too, retired from the cares of the Ministry, and accepted the position of Agent-General in London, where he subsequently received the honour of knighthood. The Ministry was then reconstructed. It was still maintained on a coalition basis ; Duncan Gillies, a cool, cautious, steady veteran, never to be surprised and rarely to be stirred, was the head of the Conservative party. Alfred Deakin represented the Liberals\u2014 young, impulsive, a little inclined to disdain the solid but commonplace ground of practical politics, and apt to take occasional airy flights into speculative cloud-heights. Gillies associated with himself H. J. Wrixon as Attorney-General and James Lorimer as Alinister of Defence ; Deakin's party was represented by C. PI. Pearson as Minister of Education, and J. L Dow as President of the Board of Lands and AVorks. The Cabinet was completed by the appointment of W. F. Walker as Commissioner of Customs; of John Nimmo as Commissioner of Public Works, and F. T. Derham as Postmaster-General. Vol, I. 3 K"], [510, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 488 But the most notable instances of recent legislation have been the Factories Act, the Early Closing Act, and the Local Option Act. They are all social experiments in the direction of interfering with people for their' own good, and it remains to be seen whether the benefits to be derived are an equivalent for the restriction of individual liberties. In 1874 a bill had been carried through Parliament by W. C. Smith for the regulation of labour in factories. It forbade the employment of women for more than eight hours in any one day, and made stringent provision for sanitary requirements in work-rooms. In 1883 a Royal Commission was appointed to inquire into the working of this Act. The report stated that in the main its provisions had worked well, but that there were still great numbers of women employed in callings wherein the long hours must certainly have an injurious effect upon their health. In shops, in restaurants, and in hotels, hundreds of young girls were employed for periods of from ten to fifteen hours daily ; and the commission declared the fact to have been elicited that the shopkeepers of all kinds regarded themselves as victims of the same process, which they felt to be a steady undermining of their constitutions. The great majority of them kept their shops open to late hours only because of the competition of an eager and avaricious few. They had tried what they could do for themselves without the help of legislation. The Early Closing Association had toiled for twenty years, and had influenced many trades. The principal drapery and mercantile establishments, in Melbourne especially, had learned to close at six o'clock every evening, and, after a long period of agitation, had granted their employes the benefit of a half-holiday upon Saturday. But in regard to the smaller shops, and those of the suburbs, the association had found its efforts quite fruitless, and before the year 1880 it became practically moribund. The shopkeepers wished to close, but could not, so long as the public would continue to transfer a large portion of its custom at late hours to those who kept their shops open. The association, before becoming defunct in 1885, passed a resolution, by 279 votes to 48, that as their prolonged and expensive efforts to ameliorate the condition of the smaller shopkeepers and their assistants by means of moral suasion had completely failed, they desired the interference of State legislation. In the year 1882 the Shopman's and Assistants' Union had been formed to agitate in the same direction. They thought that by personal influence and by canvassing they would be able to get the signatures of the shopkeepers to an agreement that they should close their premises at reasonable hours. That hope was realised in so far as regarded the signatures, and indeed for about six weeks the shops in most of the busy suburban streets were duly closed ; but by-and-bye an occasional shopkeeper, tempted by the haul to be had of all the late custom which the others had foresworn, opened his door ; the rest, afraid of losing their customers, had to follow the example, and in a fortnight all the good effect of six months' labour was dissolved. Thus the wish of the vast majority could not be secured by moral suasion, and the Shopman's and Assistants' Union also asked for legislation. The Royal Commission took the evidence of medical experts to show that the general effect of long hours upon young assistants was most detrimental, and often remained apparent throughout life ; and that many through compulsion, many through the inducement of high wages in youth, impaired their subsequent usefulness as citizens. Fortified with these expressions of opinion, Deakin, in 1885, brought in a bill of which the first part expanded and amended the Factories Bill of 1874, while the second provided a perfectly novel piece of legislation in the shape of the compulsory closing of shops at a fixed hour. With the exception of hotels, eating-houses, fruit-shops, tobacconists' shops, and a few others that were specially exempted,"], [511, "RECENT TIMES.\u2014 1880 TO 1888. 489 all shops were to close at seven o'clock in the evening except on Saturdays, when the time was to be extended to ten o'clock. But to mitigate the arbitrary character of this Act, it was provided that if two-thirds of the shopkeepers of any one kind in a district applied for the exemption of their own special trade it should be granted by the municipality of that district. After prolonged discussion the bill was duly passed by both Assembly and Council, and came into operation on 1st March 1886. It roused some little contention. There were many who looked on the whole affair as a most unwarrantable attack upon private liberty : a distinct instance of the callous tyranny of a majority. To these the gloomy look after seven o'clock of streets that had formerly been so bright and cheery far on towards midnight imparted a feeling of resentment, but after a time the remembrance of the white faces of those who had kept them gay at these unhealthy hours in many cases acted as a corrective of the first impression, and the general hostility died out. The introduction of the measure was attended by popular demonstrations. A few of the shopkeepers in some of the leading suburban thoroughfares resolved to defy the law, and kept their premises open on the second night. The only process the law provided against these people was that of summons and fine ; but that consumed time, and fines of is. were no deterrent. There seemed a possibility that a dull defiance might eventually render the law inoperative. Where a few kept open all evening, the others felt bound to follow or see their rivals win the familiarity and favour of their customers. Ere a month was over a large number of shops were to be seen in each thoroughfare, flaring their gas till nine and ten o'clock as formerly. On 30th March a vast crowd gathered in Smith-street, Collingwood, in obedience to a summons from the new Employes' Union. These in various popular ways expressed their disapproval of those whose shops were open. But order was maintained, and a patrol of police kept the footpaths open. For several nights large crowds, sometimes amounting to as many as 10,000 persons, all respectably dressed, and on the whole well conducted, gathered in Smith-street to hoot and groan in front of the open shops. After this had lasted each evening for nearly a week without disorder, beyond the breaking of two windows, the shopkeepers began to yield to the torrent of disapprobation to which they were nightly subjected ; one or two of the more obstinate held out for a few evenings longer. On one occasion there occurred some disturbance ; two more windows were broken, and seven persons were arrested ; but though there was a vast crowd, a force of fifty constables restored them to perfect order. The final effect, after some agitation in several of the suburbs, was that the shopkeepers almost all obeyed the law ; and most of them came eventually to regard it with satisfaction. The first little friction being over, the community soon became accustomed to see with tolerable uniformity all but the exempted places closed for the day when the hour of seven tolled from the Post-office tower. But it is not yet safe to prophesy the ultimate effect of the measure. In regard to Local Option, a measure whose success is as yet trembling in the balance, and in a score of other cases the Victorian community, with a hopeful, cheery spirit, has of late years tried little social experiments, which may not all have the full effect intended, but still form a pleasant sign as of a people with abundant vitality, and not afraid to attack old evils that have for ages formed unlovely barriers to general happiness. This active population, in 1886, reached for the first time a total of one million persons; just half a century after its foundation, for it was in 1S36 that Captain William Lonsdale had set up on the slopes of Batman's Hill that rude hut which was the first Government-house. What a change in so small a fraction of time! In the following year, 1887, Melbourne showed its vast extent and the opulence"], [512, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 490 of its public and private buildings, in the brilliancy of a general illumination. It was the jubilee of the reign of Queen Victoria, but it might well have combined with that the jubilee also of the city. It was on the 20th of June 1S37 that Her Majesty commenced that long and eventful reign which makes so wonderful an era in the history of human kind. The first land sale of Melbourne had taken place twenty days before, and we may well suppose that it was just about the time when the girl Queen was roused from her slumbers at break of day to be informed of her uncle's death that the pioneers of Melbourne, having bought their allotments, began to lay the foundations of those permanent buildings which constituted the real beginnings of what is now so handsome a city. Those silent gum-tree glades of the 20th June 1837 were, on the evening of the 20th June 1887, replaced by an enormous promenading crowd, that must have numbered 200,000 persons, quiet, orderly, good-tempered, accepting with many a joke the inevitable showers that poured from overhead while they plashed along the muddy roads, admiring the stars, the crowns, the mottoes in brilliant flame ; the fine facades of public buildings picked out with electric lights ; the banks and loftier shops framed in sparkling patterns of many-coloured lamps ; the transparencies, the fireworks, and all the hundreds of contrivances which a vast combination of ingenuity provides for the decoration of a city on such a festal season. The \"settlement\" beside the Yarra, \u2014 the metropolis of Melbourne, ten miles long by seven miles broad, inhabited by 380,000 persons : the contrast is such as half a century has never yet produced on any spot of mortal soil. Its history may well be a source of pride to the pioneers who helped to make it. They must pass away. They must leave only their names to identify them with the work they have done. But it has been a great and goodly work ; and if Heaven grant that they bequeath it to sons and daughters who shall make the superstructure to be worthy of the foundation, there is in the world no country whose prospect is more radiant with hope and promise than the colony which, some seven and thirty years ago, borrowed from its sovereign the illustrious name of Victoria. THE GOVERNOR'S CHALET ON MOUNT MACEDC"], [513, "MARCUS CLARKE CHAPTER XXVI. literature anb Hrt in IDictoria. THE PRESS. AWKNER was not only fthe pioneer of the city of Melbourne, but also of the Victorian press. The struggles of that active brain and that \\s restless hand to provide THE P0BUC \"BRARY: EXTER,OR AND Ii-TERIOR' for the intellectual wants of the settlers have already been woven into the general history of the colony during the year 1838. So also the advent of his rival, George Arden, has been duly chronicled. The Port Phillip Patriot and Melbourne Advertiser, and the Port Phillip Gazette were not left long in sole possession of the field, for in the next year, 1839, George Cavenagh arrived from Sydney with the appliances necessary to commence a third paper, the Port Phillip Herald. But the rapid increase of population provided room for all, and in 1840 Fawkner found it necessary to supply the Patriot with a new press and a new fount of type to keep pace with the dignity of a town of 7000 inhabitants. He therefore sent the discarded press and the surplus type to Geelong, where James Harrison edited and printed on Fawkner's behalf the Geelong Advertiser, which appeared every Saturday, beginning on the 21st September 1840. It is now the oldest newspaper of Victoria, its predecessors having all undergone changes of name and of nature sufficient to blot out their original identity. The first of these pioneer papers which got among the breakers so thickly strewn for incipient journals was the Gazette, whose uncompromising editor, Arden, not only sought a duel,"], [514, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 492 but was condemned several times to pay damages for libel, and in addition spent a time in gaol for disrespectful allusions to the choleric Judge Willis. In 1842 the Gazette passed into other hands, and in the following year Thomas M'Combie became its editor, a position which he held for eight years.' Its rival, the Patriot, lost ground in the early years by the violence and vehemence of Fawkner; but in 1841 its editorial management was assumed by William Kerr, who had come with Cavenagh from Sydney to edit the Port Phillip Herald, but now joined the older paper. Under his care the journal throve, and though we may now, on looking back on the time-tinted pages, feel a pleasant satisfaction at the progress of the years, still the journal, in regard to printing and writing and news, is singularly creditable for a community not six years old. The management of the Patriot was marked by skill and ability; but in 1845 it lost its editor, William Kerr, who, being now an alderman of the town of Melbourne, and having become a bitter partisan in municipal disputes, had been compelled to resign his connection, and Fawkner, with the assistance of an experienced journalist, himself resumed the charge of the paper. Kerr then started an opposition paper, the Courier, but its career terminated after a few months of unsteady existence. This venture dissipated the little capital that he could command. But he had some staunch supporters, and a few of them, believing that there was room for a better paper than the colony yet possessed, and anxious to provide an organ to oppose Fawkner, who was then regarded with a good deal of jealousy and ill-will, subscribed a sufficient sum to start him in another venture, which was this time christened the Argus. It commenced on a very feeble foundation ; a paper of four small pages. It was only by a series of accidents that it emerged finally from a crowd of competitors, and gave its name to the journal so inextricably bound up with the history of Victoria. For the period between 1841 and 1847 was singularly fruitful of new journalistic enterprises in Melbourne. The Free Press in 1841, the Times in 1842, and the Albion in 1847 had precarious existences extending to a few months or a year or two. The Standard was founded by Boursiquot in 1845, and commenced a vigorous career, with more capital to form a basis than any of the other ventures possessed. All these journals appeared at most only two or three times a-week, but in 1845 Fawkner on resuming the editorship of the Patriot, caused it to be published every morning, thus making it the first daily paper of Victoria. But the toil and the outlay necessary for such an enterprise were very considerable, and Fawkner had his hands full with other business. It was not long, therefore, before he sold the paper to Boursiquot, who in 1848 amalgamated it with the Standard, and christened the combination with the new name of the Daily News. At the same date the Port Phillip Herald also became a daily, and changed its title to the Melbourne Morning Herald. Thus at the time of the separation of the colony Melbourne possessed four daily papers :\u2014 the Daily News, the Morning Herald, the Port Phillip Gazette and the Argus. But when the gold discoveries came, the course of the journalist became filled with difficulties. The compositors departed for the diggings ; and the reporters also packed up their bundles and went off. Not even at five times the former cost could the perplexed editor and the bewildered printer bring out the morning sheet as formerly. Hence an immediate disturbance in the journalistic adjustment ; two of the weaker disappeared, being absorbed by their wealthier rivals. The Argus was that which exhibited at this crisis the greatest capacity for endurance, for it had passed into hands of the right sort. Its first proprietor and editor, William Kerr, had earned into its columns that belligerent disposition which caused the severance of his connect.on with the Patriot. In one of the town council squabbles, which even in Arcadian times M'Combie's \"History of Victoria,\" p. 327."], [515, "LITERATURE AND ART LN VICTORIA. 493 burnt out their squib-like career, he had fallen foul of the mayor, and had carried the quarrel into his leaders, so that one fine day he found himself sentenced to heavy damages for a libel. These his friends paid for him ; but he again wrote more savagely than before. Again an action for libel went against him ; no one this time would pay the \u00a3500 of damages, and the fiery journalist found himself in pecuniary difficulties, which he could surmount only by the sale of his paper. It was purchased by Edward Wilson, a young man of energy, ambition, and ability, who had come to Melbourne in 1842, in its youngest days, and had joined J. S. Johnston in a cattle station, near Dandenong ; but his tastes were literary ; he was filled with enthusiasm for political reform ; he had a ready and caustic pen ; when the chance thus offered he and his partner Johnston became proprietors of the Argus in 1847. They had some means of their own, and they had the support of friends with capital. The Argus began to distance its rivals, and during the derangement of the time of gold, Wilson and Johnston amalgamated with it the Port Phillip Gazette and the Daily News. Thus there were but two papers left \u2014 the Argus and the Morning Herald \u2014 and these, ere long, began to reap a golden harvest, for though the price of labour began to fall again, yet the population was swollen five-fold. The Argus, however, had the leading place, for Wilson's strong, though somewhat coarse writing, took the fancy of the diggers, and theirs were the views he advocated. He sided with all their grievances, denounced Latrobe, dealt scornfully with officialism, and fiercely demanded the concession of manhood suffrage and the \"unlocking of the lands\" \u2014 a phrase of which he was the inventor. For a year or two the Argus swayed the political destinies of the colony. Its circulation steadily increased. On the 3rd January 1S52 it announces that its daily issue is 3100 copies \u2014 a number equal to that of the Sydney Morning Herald, till then by far the most important paper of Australia. On that morning the Argus joyfully exclaims, \" And now great Leviathan of the Southern Seas, for a race with YOU.\" But it rapidly distanced the older paper, and ere a couple of years were past, its circulation was nearly 20,000 \u2014 almost equal to that of any paper in the world at that time. It was one of the sights of Melbourne in those days to watch the great crowd that gathered at the Argus office to purchase \"extraordinaries\" when the mail arrived, and the endless columns of advertisements became to the proprietors a gold mine of vastly more than Bendigo proportions; that is to the prudent and far-seeing Edward Wilson, for J. S. Johnston was unlucky enough to have parted with his share to James Gill, who in his turn sold out to Lachlan M'Kinnon. From that day to this the firm has been known by the name of Wilson and M'Kinnon. The rapid prosperity of the Argus was a terrible trial to its only rival, the Melbourne Morning Herald, which, in spite of its staid and respectable conduct, and the receipt of official support, went slowly down the hill. At the end of February 1852 the Argus proclaimed that in point of circulation it was the leading journal of Australia; and took to itself the credit of having fulfilled to the letter every promise it had made to its subscribers. Thereupon the Herald burst forth into sarcastic poesy : \u2014 \"Argus t'other day was heard To say he always kept his word And ne'er was known to break it. No doubt,\u2014 the thing may seem absurd,\u2014 But zounds, a man must keep his word, When nobody will take it.\" To which in its next issue the Argus tartly replied \u2014 \" If what no one will take must be certainly kept, What heaps of the Herald to the dust-hole are swept.\""], [516, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 494 Little amenities of that kind were very frequent during 1852 and 1853, and an amusing hour or two may be spent in reading the opinions which each gives of the other, now that a generation has laid a little of the gentle dust of time upon their once all-important quarrels. In 1855 a marked change appeared in the attitude of the Argus. Edward Wilson in his vehement earnestness had stirred up the people, and especially the miners, to assert their rights. But at the end of 1854 the occurrence of the Eureka stockade affair had startled him. It seemed an ugly business. He wanted reform and not rebellion, and the Argus was by no means zealous in defence of the prisoners who were tried for their complicity in that transaction. Wilson seared that further agitation would lead to some disastrous social convulsion, and from that time forward the paper adopted a much more moderate tone, though its columns exhibited even a more marked ability, Higinbotham being a constant contributor, and Aspinall having been brought to the colony in order to join its staff. The more violent among the diggers accused the paper of deserting them, and it rapidly lost its hold on the affections of the radical and chartist party. But during the democratic period of the Argus, in the year 1S54, there had been made an attempt to found a journal of a staid and conservative character, to counterbalance the fiery eloquence of Edward Wilson. It was called the Age, and was the enterprise of several merchants and stock-owners, of whom the principal were John Cooke, Henry Cooke, and Walter Powell. They sank a considerable sum of money in the venture, but after a short time abandoned it, and the machinery and type were taken over by an association, consisting of the employes of the journal. The compositors, pressmen, reporters, and literary staff, were all shareholders ; but the plan was by no means successful. The editor during these times of co-operation was Ebenezer Syme, into whose hands the enterprise passed more and more completely, and after a short time he purchased it outright from the association. Ebenezer Syme and his brother David, who now assumed the control of the Age, were in politics as ardent in support of the rights of the people as Edward Wilson had ever been, and in proportion as the Argus drew back from the position of extreme democracy that it once had held, they pressed forward to occupy the opening, which, in 1857, became all the more evident when Edward Wilson, by reason of declining health and failing eyesight, was forced to abandon his labours and return to Europe. The editorship of the Argus was then assumed by George Higinbotham, under whose care it lost none of its ability, but cer tainly gathered a dignity of manner which had been ab sent in its period of impet uous vehemence. At this time, therefore, the Argus began to assume the posi tion of the most responsible journal of Australia \u2014 the leading organ of mercantile and professional interests, On the other hand, the death of Ebenezer Syme, in 1859, left the sole management of the Age to his more ardently democratic brother, David, under whose editorship it soon began a policy of educa ting the people in the way of radical reforms; it assumed an attitude, first of friendli ness, and then of unhesita ting support towards the idea of protection, and for the twenty years between 1860 and 1880, the Age was practi cally the mover in all the PAVI0 SVME"], [517, "LITERATURE AND ART IN VICTORIA. 495 democratic agitations which made the political history of the period. Orators and intriguers rounded up their flocks in Parliament ; crowds of the free and independent voters took their way at successive elections to give their voice at the polling booths ; but the voice was really the voice of David Syme, who, from behind the scenes, stirred up a people that was all unconscious of the secret power that moved it. Until 1868 the price of the Age had been threepence, like that of the Argus; in that year its price was reduced to one penny ; in a few weeks its circulation was quadrupled, and from that time forward it pressed on, though not without times of financial trouble, until it reached what it now proudly claims to possess \u2014 the largest circulation in Australia. But long before these days, away back in 1854, the Melbourne Morning Herald had been passing through an unhappy time. It had found much difficulty in holding its own against the Argus alone, and when the Age was started, its course became still more full of troubles, and several changes of proprietorship did not in any way decrease them. In 1855 it was reduced to the humiliation of ceasing to be a daily, and for two years it appeared only twice a-week. In 1857 the infusion of more capital enabled it to take its place again as a daily ; but its circulation remained small ; and so long as it charged threepence, as did the Argus and the Age, its chances of increase were but slight. In 1863 it took what was then the bold step of reducing its price to a penny, and fortune smiled on it for a time, but in 1868 the Age followed the same course, and the Herald was again in distress. Next year it made a still more decided change, and from Monday, 4th January 1869, it became an evening paper, the first of the kind in Victoria ; in that form it has filled successfully an important position in journalism without having to fear the powerful competition of the great morning journals. An early feature in the Victorian press was the establishment of singularly excellent weekly papers in connection with the morning dailies. The first was the creation of Ebenezer and David Syme, who, in 1858, sounded the Leader as a country issue of the Age. Containing everything of importance that had appeared during the week in the daily paper, and adding to it a great deal of useful matter \u2014 agricultural, sporting, and literary \u2014 it speedily became the guide, philosopher, and friend of thousands of families throughout the remotest parts of the than the Leader, and soon attained an acknowledged position as the chief lite rary authority in Australia, occupying in regard to the colonies somewhat the same position as that occu pied by the Spectator and Athen\u00e6um in England. It made, however, a very special success in other depart ments also, though at a later period under the management of Henry Gullett, its lite rary excellence became even more distinctly recognised throughout Australia. country. In 1864 the proprie- tors of the Argus followed the same course. They had just brought out upon their staff a young contributor, F. W. Haddon, who had made himself some little reputation in London as a writer upon statistical subjects. He had been engaged on the Argus work for a year. To him was entrusted the manage ment of the new venture, which was called the Austral asian. It made itself more distinctly a literary organ F. \\V. HADDON. 3L Vol. I."], [518, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 496 Meantime, after three years' management of the Australasian, F. W. Haddon had assumed the editor's chair in the Argus office, a position he has held for twenty-one years\u2014 a long and stormy period, throughout which the Argus has had many a political battle to fight, and its editor many a campaign to devise. David Syme has been still longer at the head of the Age, no less than twenty-nine years having rolled by since first he assumed the control; but for some considerable time it has been understood that the editorial work has been carried on by A. L. Windsor, a writer of great skill, but of retiring disposition. Shortly after the time when the Age reduced its price to a penny, and a week after the Herald became an evening paper, a new penny journal was established, entitled the Daily Telegraph ; it took for its editor Howard Willoughby, who had made himself a notable journalistic reputation as a special correspondent of the Argus. In conjunction with it there was established the Weekly Times as its Saturday complement ; but in spite of able writing and strenuous efforts it had no very robust existence, until bought up by a religious syndicate, to be the organ of orthodoxy. The Argus and the Age had both assumed a position of much freedom and independence in discussing religious matters, and the Daily Telegraph then found it possible, by appealing for support to the churches and church-goers, to secure a footing much more certain than before. At this change of policy, however, Howard Willoughby resumed his connection with the Argus. The pictorial element in the Victorian press was at an early period introduced by the establishment of Punch, which, under the editorship of Jardine Smith, and with cartoons by Thomas Carrington, displayed an ability which, if it fell very distinctly short of its great London namesake, was yet fully comparable with almost any other humourous periodical elsewhere. The Illustrated Australian Nezus, established in connection with the Age office, was a remarkable effort for a small community, and had a distinct influence in the development of art in the colony. Still more was this apparent when a second illustrated paper, the Sketcher, appeared in connection with the Argus ; what with woodcuts, and frequent coloured supplements, the two in competition have enlivened many and many a bush home in the remotest regions of Australia. It is indeed a singular thing to see so small a community contrive to support two illustrated papers of the degree of excellence to which these have attained. The provincial press of Victoria has been a source of surprise to visitors from older lands. So soon as a village has two hundred inhabitants it is very nearly a certainty that a printer will appear, and cast himself with headlong zeal into the task of promoting the shamefully neglected interests of the innocent township, expending once a week a column of editorial matter upon things in general, with frequent reference to the fact that in affairs of empire, as he speaks, so it is done. But as places grow, these papers become more elevated in tone, and, as a rule, pass into the hands of men of some means, who employ a professional editor. The larger cities are now all provided with journals after the most approved metropolitan pattern. In Ballarat several very early attempts were made, but it was not till 1855 that one was established which was destined to permanence. It was the Ballarat Star, which, after a troublous year or so, emerged into undoubted success, and from that day to this has maintained a most honourable position. But ten years later it saw a formidable rival in the Ballarat Courier, which, after a long struggle for supremacy, has certainly attained to the victory, if it is to be awarded to the possession of the larger circulation. Sandhurst also, at an early date, supplied itself with well-printed and ably-conducted journals, the Bendigo Advertiser and the Bendigo Independent having long been organs of weight and influence throughout a populous"], [519, "LITERATURE AND ART IN VICTORIA. 497 district. But indeed of the 216 journals which the colony now possesses there is a very respectable fraction whose appearance, management, and literary work are surprisingly good, even if no account be taken of the smallness of the community which supports them. LITERATURE. The earliest efforts at the production of books in Victoria were necessarily humble. The first was Arden's \"Latest Information from Port Phillip,\" which appeared in 1840. About a dozen pamphlets were all that the next seven years produced, and then T. M'Combie published his \" Australian Sketches,\" a collection of articles which had already been printed in various English magazines. Another dozen pamphlets followed ; but that represents the total literature, other than journalistic, up to the date of separation. The first important attempt to found a literary reputation in Victoria was that of James Bonwick, a school inspector. What a busy worker, at a time when there were few to regard him and fewer to appreciate ! \u2014 His \" Notes of a Gold Digger,\" in 1852; his \"Reader for Australian Youth,\" in the same year; his \"Australian Gold Digger's Magazine,\" in 1852 and 1853; his \"Early Days of Van Diemen's Land,\" in 1856; his \"Discovery and Settlement of Port Phillip,\" and his \"William Buckley,\" in 1856; his \"Western Victoria,\" published at Geelong in 1858; his \"John Batman,\" in 1863; his \"Curious Facts of Old Colonial Days,\" his \" Last of the Tasmanians,\" and his \" Daily Life and Origin of the Tasmanians,\" all in 1870; his \"Tasmanian Lily,\" and his \"Mike Howe, the Bushranger,\" in 1873; his \"First Twenty Years of Australia,\" in 1882; his \"Lost Tasmanian Race,\" in 1884; and at a later date his large volume of materials for the early history of Victoria, together with no less than sixteen smaller works, make a body of literary matter which entitles him to much credit. It must have been a thankless task in the early days of the colony, in the newness and rawness of it all, to make so steady and so laborious an effort for the foundation of a Victorian literature. Much of Mr. Bonwick's work is of permanent value to the historian and to the ethnologist, and not a little of it will maintain a prolonged existence by reason of its interest to the general reader. Thomas M'Combie was another of those who sought in early days to remove from Victoria the reproach of being cultureless and without the charm of letters. His \" Australian Sketches\" were followed in 1858 by his \" History of Victoria,\" a work accused sometimes of beino- dull, but which, beyond an occasional turgidity of style and a tendency to introduce the author and his exploits, offers little ground for that accusation, the book being in the main eminently readable. But it was not till after 1860, when the ferment of the gold discoveries had subsided and left behind them an active, intelligent, and ambitious community, that much progress was made in literary pursuits. Previous to that date there had been two small volumes of poems printed, but not sold, in spite of repeated reductions of price. The first attempt that possessed enough of merit to make a little reputation was that of Edwin Exon, whose volume, entitled \" The Lost Flower Found,\" was tuneful enough and sufficiently pervaded by a quietly meditative poetic turn to entitle it to the distinction of being the pioneer of \\-actorian poetry. It appeared in 1862, and in the following year a second poet appeared in the person of M. K. Beveridge, who made the first attempt to embody the legends of the aboriginals in verse, but his efforts, which were after the style of Hiawatha, had too little merit to give them a permanent existence. Several others appeared about the same time, whose volumes for many years were constantly to be found in quantity at nominal rates in the second-hand book shops ; but in 1865 came the scholarly work of John Finnamore. His \" Francesca Vasari\" and \" Carpio\" are"], [520, "49g VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. dramas of that poetic and unactable character which is a feature in modern literature. The one is an old-world tale of love and adventure in Provence ; the other the story of the famous Spanish champion in the middle ages. The highest finish and much literary grace, however, failed to give these fine poems any hold upon popular taste, and the name of Finnamore is still practically unknown. During the existence of the goldfields commissioners, one of them was the poet R. H. Home, whose reputation in England as the author of \"Orion\" had previously stood high with the cultured few. But he had been unable to make a living by his poetry in London, and had come to the colonies, where a uniform, a good horse, and \u00a3450 a-year, made some sort of equivalent for expatriation from the world of letters. He wrote his fine work \" Prometheus, the Firebringer,\" among us, but it was less what he did than the enthusiasm for literature which he inspired that is to be reckoned of moment in our history. From that house of corrugated iron, that still stands in its little garden in Collins-street, a relic of times gone by, he stirred up his young companions, who formed a little clique, to think of literature as an aim worth striving for, and, in the midst of an utterly bohemian life, he had a reckless devotion to art that had an unmistakable influence. Almost immediately afterwards there came to light the only two poets of acknowledged merit whom Victoria has yet produced : \u2014 Adam Lindsay Gordon, and George Gordon M'Crae. The former of these takes precedence over all the poets whom Australia as yet can claim to be her own. Not that he was of Australian birth. He was born in the Azores, and educated at Cheltenham, in England, where his father, a fine old officer, retired from the East Indian service, was professor of Oriental languages. Lindsay Gordon, as a lad, was wayward and high spirited, and being passionately devoted to horses, he passed much of his time with men of the jockey and horse-dealing description, scampering over the Cotswold Hills when his father supposed him to be at Woolwich or at Oxford. At last one scrape worse than the rest induced him to leave England for the colonies, and he never again saw friend or relative. Landing in Adelaide he joined the mounted police force, and rode for a time in the Mount Alexander escort. But there were duties connected with the service which induced him at a later time to resign, and to adopt a free life under the stars by night, and beneath the broad blue sky all day long. It was the calling of a horse-breaker that he followed, moving from station to station, and breaking in the young colts at each as he passed. He wrestled and struggled with buckjumpers all day, and when evening fell camped by himself in a lonely place, a mile away from any habitation. After a few years of this life a change occurred through the discovery that some years before, his father and his mother had both died, and that a sum of \u00a37000 was his by inheritance. He refused to return to the friends who had cast him off in his wilder days ; the money came out to Australia. He entered the South Australian Parliament, but his ways were not the ways of legislation, and he soon dropped out again. What with lending money to good-fellows in distress who were never good enough to pay it back again ; what with keeping racehorses and backing them freely, he soon reached the end of his little fortune, and had again to look out for employment to support himself, and now also a wife and a little daughter. He bought a business in Ballarat, and strove as a livery-stablekeeper to lead the life of an ordinary citizen ; but it was of no use ; he could neither keep books, nor forbear to lend money to people who were sure to return it, yet rarely did so. Meantime the poetic faculty was making itsc'f heard in him, and he sent occasional verses to the sporting paper, Bells Life in Victoria. They were professedly only racing rhymes, but his knowledge"], [521, "LLTERATURE AND ART IN VICTORIA 499 of the horse, and his deep and meditative acquaintance with the Australian bush and its characteristics, made these rough verses more than they pretended to be. They had their admirers, and in the following year, 1867, he published in Melbourne a collection forming a small volume, entitled \" Sea Spray and Smoke Drift.\" In addition to the strong but somewhat unfinished verses contributed to the sporting journal, he incorporated in this volume twenty pieces of a character never before attained to in Australia ; the work of a powerful mind moved to high impulses by the love of beauty and the scorn of baseness ; but exhibiting an undercurrent of remorse, and an ever-recurring sigh that all is vanity \u2014 vanity of vanities. His lines are filled with what he calls \u2014 \"The restless throbbings and burnings That hope unsatisfied brings ; The weary longing and yearnings For the mystical better things.\" Besides this volume, he published, in 1867, his lyric drama \"Ashtaroth ;\" that is, he printed five hundred volumes, which nobody bought, but which he had to pay for. His business in Ballarat meantime was going astray, and when a legacy arrived of several hundred pounds from a deceased aunt, he found that it would just pay his debts and set him free. He settled in Melbourne, where he spent a year or two in a partly literary life, some of his best poems appearing from time to time in the Australasian. But for a living he had to rely on training horses for the races, and riding them in steeple chases. He was one of the most popular figures that ever appeared at Flemington. His reck less daring, his admir able but eccentric riding, caused deafening roars of applause to rend the air as he trotted back from the winning-post the victor in a tough contest. But these pur suits cost him his life ; several heavy falls bat tered his head so badly that his life became in tolerable, and only in opiates could he find relief. He sought for more suitable employ ment, but could find none. When he was at his worst, and afraid that he could not live very long, there came the news that he was heir to a very rich estate in Scotland. On the strength of this he raised a little money, and published a third volume, which he called \" Bush Ballads and Galloping Rhymes ;\" but further news reported that the Scotch law courts had upset the entail ; he was after all not the heir. But he was now in debt, and knew not where to find even a week's subsistence. On the day after his book appeared he wandered at dawn with a rifle down into the tea-tree scrub at Brighton, and as the forenoon rose high, the fishermen discovered his body, dead and cold, in a little grassy circlet among the bushes. His last volume is filled with noble work ; strong in thought, and original in expression. But the undercurrent complies with Shelley's dictum that \u2022\u25a0Our sweetest songs are those that tell of saddest thought,\" for there is a tender melancholy underlying it all. Gordon was one who saw the wondious"], [522, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 500 beauty of the world, and felt the joyous pulse of life, but he was for ever perplexed with the mystery of it all ; for ever was he brooding on the question : whither does it all tend ? He has laid bare, as no one else has ever done in Australia, the secret workings of a rich and powerful soul, and he has set the picture in a framework of Australian scenery, his gloomy thoughts being all the more deepened by the brightness of the Nature that surrounded him. Our other genuine poet of Victoria is George Gordon MacCrae, who, in 1867, published two fine aboriginal romances, after the style of Sir Walter Scott's \" Marmion.\" These were entitled \" Balladeadro \" and \" Mamba \" ; they give a picture of native life which is true in its details, though undoubtedly throwing a glamour over it as a whole that makes it seem nobler than it was. But the descriptions are truly poetic ; the words are chosen with nice care, and the lines have the rythm of charming music. No one who cares for poetry, and who has twice or thrice read these charming tales, will think of them subsequently without pleasant emotions. Gordon MacCrae subsequently published a poem of heavier calibre \u2014 his \" Iron Mask,\" an idealistic treatment of the pathetic story of the life-long victim of the jealousy of Louis XIV. The refine ment of feeling and delicacy of workmanship exhibited throughout the poem, though not achieving for the author any widespread popularity, have given him a standing in our slender literature. Among prose writers, the most prominent name is that of Marcus Clarke. Though he was not of Australian birth, his work was most undoubtedly Australian. His story was somewhat that of Lindsay Gordon. A spoiled boy, with no mother, and little watched over by a careless father, he had indulged himself in all the pleasures of London while still only a lad. Then his father died, and, with a small sum of money in his possession, he was shipped off to Australia in 1864 by friends who feared to find him unmanageable in London. He entered the Bank of Australasia, but uniformly contrived to add up all the money columns wrongly. He then had a year or two of what was called \"colonial experience\" on a station in the Wimmera, and there gathered an idea of station life, of Australian scenery, and up-country manners, such as his retentive memory and descriptive powers afterwards turned to good account. In 1S67 he returned to Melbourne, with an introduction to the proprietors of the Argus and Australasian, who employed him as a reporter. However, that class of work suited him much less than the contributing of literary articles, and the series he entitled the \" Peripatetic Philosopher \" made a distinct and sudden mark in the journalism of the colony. Under the disguise of an old wharf-loafer, who lived, like Diogenes, in a barrel, or some such primitive lodging, yet was withal a philosopher, he quizzed the follies, lashed the vices, and moralised over the tragedies of colonial life.\" From that time forward his career was that of a journalist in Melbourne, working for the Argus, then for the Age, and occasionally for the Herald. But he was likewise editor of various periodicals \u2014 the Colonial Monthly, Humbug, and the Australian fournal. It was for this latter periodical that he wrote his most important work, the novel entitled: \"For the Term of His Natural Life.\" It is a terrible story, intended to portray the horrors of convict times in Tasmania, but for artistic purposes the author had to make his hero an innocent man and a gentleman, who was transported to Tasmania on a false charge. He undergoes all the suffering that tyrant gaolers and brutal officers can heap upon him, and, out of these sombre colours, Marcus Clarke has painted a picture whose gloomy power exercises a most fascinating spell over the mind of the reader. In 1882 he died, a worn-out man, though a young one, being then only thirty-five. Some of his best work had been written when he was only twenty ; his novel appeared \u25a0 H. G. Turner, \" Melbourne Review.\""], [523, "LLTERATURE AND ART IN VICTORIA. 501 when he was twenty-three ; and it is not given to men both to ripen early and to last long, and towards the close of his short life he had contrived to do much sterling work. His \" Old Tales of a Young Country,\" his \" Holiday Peak and Other Tales,\" including the exquisite gem of \" Pretty Dick,\" his quaint little tale, \" 'Twixt Shadow and Shine,\" and dozens upon dozens of essays and sketches, generally displaying the literary faculty in its most delicate form, all testify to an inborn genius which has assuredly given to Marcus Clarke the reputation of the most accomplished writer Australia has yet produced in the lighter and more graceful paths of literature. In more solid work, by far the leading place is due to William Edward Hearn, whose philosophical books, four in number, form a noble life's work for a man of learning. The first, published in 1864, he named \" Plutology,\" a new term he wished to substitute for the clumsy expression Political Economy. It is the most complete manual of that science that has ever been published. Then came, in 18S7, his \"Government of England,\" a treatise on the growth of the British constitution. Dr. Hearn was essentially a lawyer, but a philosophical lawyer ; and his book, though written from a legal point of view, has a philosophical basis, which makes it of singular value as an exposition of a subject which every year renders more and more important. He was the son of a clergyman in the South of Ireland ; educated at Trinity College, Dublin, he became a classical scholar of brilliant acquirements, and was chosen professor of Greek in the Queen's College at Galway, an appointment he left in 1854 to join the University of Melbourne. There he threw himself ardently into the work of original research, and not only succeeded in making himself a teacher of permanent importance in moulding the thoughts and stimulating the energies of the young students of the colony, but also, in long protracted studies through the hours of midnight, carried on a series of literary labours which will always give his name a most honourable place in the history of Australia. His third book was his \" Aryan Household,\" a most laboriously learned, yet clearly written, and scientifically arranged investigation into the structure and peculiarities of the social and family life of the remote stock from which the Indo-European races have been derived. Dr. Hearn's later years were filled with the toilsome but eminently useful task of codifying the Victorian statutes, and in connection with that, he wrote a work entitled \" Legal Duties and Rights.\" In the midst of these labours death overtook him in 188S ere he had seen the full completion of his self-imposed mission for the benefit of the colony. In the way of historians, Victoria has had quite a number of writers. William Westgarth's careful and readable \"Colony of Victoria,\" published in 1864, and Labilliere's \"Early History of Victoria,\" which appeared in 1878, have often been quoted in this work. Withers, as the historian of Ballarat, and Tenison-Woods as the historian of Australian exploration, are both extremely interesting. In the department of ethnology, Victoria has contributed very largely to the description of the aborigines and of their manners. Bunce was the first to write in any systematic way on that important subject. Fison and A. W. Howitt have worked in conjunction, and their book is well known throughout the world wherever the customs of savage races form a branch of comparative study. But the first effort to deal in a comprehensive and exhaustive manner with the whole subject was the work, in two great volumes, published by the Government under the supervision of R. Brough Smyth \u2014 a treatise that does for the Australian natives what School craft's five huge tomes did for the North American Indians, with this distinct advantage, that it is perfectly readable, which Schoolcraft's terrible dissertation never will be."], [524, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 502 But later knowledge and an unrivalled personal experience gave to E. M. Curr a very decided advantage, which makes his three volumes published in 1887 the most complete and judicious account ever given to the world in reference to this fast-vanishing race ; every one of whose customs, every one of whose physiological and mental peculiarities, whose every dialect and every invention will eventually be of the keenest interest to those who will piece out the history of man's development and progress by the aid of comparative ethnology. Mr. Curr, in 1883, gave a most graphic account of the life of the early pioneers in his \" Squatting in Victoria.\" Into this he wove many of his personal experiences and observations among the natives ; but the great work of his life has been the \"Australian Races,\" a book whose value will be only truly appreciated by specialists, and yet among them will, in all probability, attain to an always increasing reputation. ART. For the first twenty years of its existence Victoria tried nothing at all in the way of art, beyond a few water-colour sketches and a few engravings, that are valuable to us now only as mementoes of early times. The)' certainly have no artistic value. The first success began immediately after the times of the gold excitement. In 1856 a gentleman named Frank Newton, after much industry, succeeded in gathering our first exhibition of pictures. It was held in the exhibition building in Williams-street, and was opened on 6th December of that year. The artists were of course all of them men who had received their training elsewhere, but who had brought their skill and experience with them as so much capital for use in a new country. Chevalier was there with six of his elaborately and daintily painted water-colours. Von Guerard attracted general admiration with a fine \" View of Mount Abrupt.\" The careful painter Gilfillan was represented, and Strutt exhibited some characteristic Australian work. H. E. Davies, with a collection but the inaugural address was delivered by James Smith, whose name from that time to this has been most intima tely connected with all pro jects for the furtherance of art and artistic tastes in the colony, and who has thrown all the influence of his refined and elegant literary style into the cause of culture in Vic toria. In this address he first suggested the foundation of a National Gallery as a suit able companion to the Public Library. of thirteen pictures, carried off the palm for industry, and E. L. Montefiore, with a series in Indian ink, was a great delight to the taste of that generation. A small but vigorously-handled collection of sculptures was contribu ted by Summers, Mackennal, and Lorando Jones. Out of this effort there sprang the Victorian Society of Fine Arts, which held its inaugural conversazione on 15th December 1856. The president was F. R. Wilkinson, JAMES SMITH. The Victorian Society of Fine Arts held one or two subsequent exhibitions, but the public were very apathetic, an assemblage of sixty on the opening day being considered something excellent, while on subsequent days, if half-a-dozen stray people took a turn round the collection\" the attendance was considered a good average. It was clear that the Victorian public required to' be stirred up to a taste for art; and the idea of the formation of a National Gallery was warmly taken up by Redmond Barry and other men of influence as a useful preliminary step"], [525, "LITERATURE AND ART IN VICTORIA. 503 In 1862 the trustees of the Public Library obtained a grant of \u00a31000 with which to make a commencement. They purchased casts of the Elgin marbles, and of seventy antique statues, together with sixty-three busts and a quantity of other art exhibits, which were shown at the library, and in the course of a couple of months attracted no less than 62,000 visitors, a result that was clearly advantageous to the foundation of a correct taste. In 1863 the sum of \u00a31000 was voted by Parliament for the further encouragement of artistic tastes, and a commission was appointed to inquire into the condition of the fine arts in the colonies. This commission recommended that of the \u00a31000, \u00a3200 should be offered as a prize for the best picture painted in any of the colonies, and that the balance should be employed in purchasing three or four pictures as the commencement of a gallery. On 24th December 1864 the oil paintings so purchased were for the first time exhibited, along with forty-three colonial pictures which competed for the prize ; the \u00a3200 were awarded to Chevalier for his view of the \" Buffalo Ranges,\" a picture which was unmistakably the finest effort made until that date in the representation of Australian scenery. The trustees entered upon their task in a judicious manner. Their first purchase, the charming \" Portrait of a Lad)-,\" indicated an honest endeavour to rise above the meretricious, and to lead the public from popular to artistic perceptions. The trustees resolved to avoid the purchase of copies of old masters, but to spend their funds in buying, not a number of moderately good pictures, but rather a few choice specimens of one or two good schools. \u00a32000 were sent to England to be spent in this manner, and Mr. Childers and Sir Charles Eastlake agreed to make the choice of the pictures. It is doubtful whether their standard of selection was equal to that anticipated in the colon)-, for of the thirteen pictures they sent out, two were the \"Rose of England\" and the \"Rosebud of England,\" by Baxter. But, on the other hand, they sent out a replica of Cope's \" Departure of the Pilgrim Fathers,\" originally painted for the Westminster Palace ; Herdman's \" Ferngatherer\"; Folingsby's fine study of \" Bunyan in Prison\"; Schaggeny's \" Sheep in Repose\"; and other genuine works. After Sir Charles Eastlake's death, Alfred Taddy Thomson was requested to act as purchaser in London. He had been one of those squatting pioneers who ventured out on the Fiery Creek in very early times. He was now settled in leisured comfort in London. His selections were most appropriate, including Peter Graham's delightful \"Autumnal Showers\"; Weber's \"First Snow\"; Edwin Long's \"Question of Propriety\"; and Webb's magnificent \" View of Rotterdam.\" There was as yet no proper place for the bestowal of the collection, which began to grow of reasonable size. In 1866, when the Intercolonial Exhibition was over, a part of its building was devoted to that purpose. But it was not till 1871 that the collection, then amounting to forty-eight oil-paintings and a few water-colours, was properly housed in a temporary structure designed for the purpose. In that year Parliament voted more money for the purchase of pictures, and twenty-seven other oil-paintings were added in instalments during the next four years, the total cost of the collection being then \u00a38000, for which sixty-two pictures had been bought, in addition to about twenty others which had been presented by various donors. The trustees of the National Gallery were not content with these efforts to educate the public taste. In 1869 they established a loan exhibition, which showed that the wealthy squatters were beginning to bring into the country art-treasures of considerable value. No less than a thousand pictures, many of them gems in their own class, were there collected, and nearly twice as many other art exhibits made a display such as Victoria had never hoped to witness for many a long year. Vol. I. 3 M"], [526, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 504 Various efforts were thus converging in the direction of developing those higher tastes that exercise so mysterious and so sweetening an influence upon life ; and that to a most satisfactory extent; no less than 392,000 persons having been recorded as visitors to the National Gallery in 1874, a number that increased at the rate of 30,000 a-year. But on the art capacities of the colony a most marked influence was produced by the advent of one or two painters \u2014 men not merely possessed of the technical skill which schools can give and practice develop, but artists of power and genius. By far the most important of these was Louis Buvelot, who, after a most successful career in Brazil and in the East Indies, as well as in his native land, Switzerland, had, in 1865, been driven by ill-health to settle in Melbourne. His intense love of nature and constant life in the open air enabled him to grasp the salient points of our Australian landscapes with a truth and suggestiveness that no one previously had approached ; others had by toilful elaboration of their pictures, and painful nibbling at details, shown the conscientious desire to imitate the nature around them, but Buvelot, by assiduous practice in his preliminary studies and sketches, learnt to express the noblest inspirations upon his canvas with that masterly ease and that large-minded consciousness of power, which delight and satisfy the educated eye. Buvelot's first public productions, his \" Winter Morning at Hei delberg,\" and his \"Summer Afternoon at Templestowe,\" were recognised as of singular merit, and were purchased for the National Gallery. The same institution, two years later, purchased his still finer picture, called \" Waterhole at Coleraine,\" a brilliant yet exquisitely tender interpreta tion of an Australian sum mer's eve, and unquestionably the finest work of art yet produced in Australia. His labours were constant, and of the many pictures that grew upon his easel into the fresh beauty of nature, there were scarcely any that did not reach the highest, or very nearly the highest, level of the landscape painter's art. LOUIS BUVELOT. But the production of fine pictures was only part of the services rendered to the colony by Louis Buvelot. He awakened a very great enthusiasm among the young who were gifted with artistic instincts and ambitions ; and his influence is very clearly seen in the work of that band of earnest students and careful painters who are now beginning to gather reputation as an indigenous school of art. The growth of such a school has necessarily been very slow. An impulse was given to it by the formation, in 1870, of the Victorian Academy of Arts, which took the place of the long defunct Society of Fine Arts. Its first exhibition contained 215 pictures, all painted in the colony. Buvelot stood easily first with several charmingly fresh and graceful productions. Von Guerard displayed a loving zeal for the delineation of characteristic Australian scenes; Thomas Wright, and E. C. Cook, and Vandenhouten showed numbers of painstaking landscapes; O R. Campbell and Chester Earles made a creditable beginning in the way of figure-subjects, the \" L' Allegro \" and \"II Penseroso \" of the latter being the first notable attempt at that class of work which had yet been made in the colony. The Academy of Arts held its annual exhibition with unfailing regularity, and some of the earlier collections were most interesting and promising, and as the years proceeded there appeared more and more of the work of young men trained in the colony, among whom the name of John White obtained a merited prominence. This tendency was greatly promoted by the"], [527, "LLTERATURE AND ART IN VICTORIA. 505 foundation, in 1S70, of a national school of painting, under the charge of Von Guerard, and a national school of design, under Thomas Clarke. These were both in connection with the National Gallery, and students of the latter had the great advantage of working among the fine collection of casts from the antique which the gallery possessed. In 1876, at the death of Thomas Clarke, O. R. Campbell became the head of the school of design, and in 1882, on the resignation of Von Guerard, the National Gallery, as well as the art schools in connection with it, were placed under the charge of Q. F. Folingsby, who had recently settled in the colony. Under his control the institution has become modelled more and more on sounder lines, and promises to be a leading factor in developing the art resources of Victoria. In 1886 the distinctively Australian school found themselves strong enough to establish the Australian Artists' Association, with two exhibitions a-year, in rivalry of the Academy, which, being of an imported character that tended to grow feebler and feebler every year as the supply of imported artists diminished, finally coalesced with its younger rival. But nothing that Australia has yet witnessed in the way of art can compare with the superb collections of pictures that formed the most delightful region in the vast wilderness of the Exhibition of 1880. There, in beautifully appointed courts, were gathered treasures from Belgium and France, from England and Germany and Italy. The exquisite loveliness of the French work, the masterly power of the German, made first the despair and then the stimulus of the local artists, and their subsequent work has indicated how beneficial was the influence. In 1887 the arrival of a large collection lent by the Grosvenor Gallery of London, and containing a considerable number of characteristic paintings of the recent English school, had a similar though less powerful influence in the education not only of the public taste, but also of the aims and ideals of our future artists. A great step in the direction of art culture was taken in 1870 by the establishment of evening schools of design for elementary instruction in freehand, model, and mechanical drawing ; during the first twelve years the movement increased from six schools with 600 pupils to thirty-nine with 2300. These were scattered all over the colony wherever the population was large enough, and their influence has been very beneficial. The value of an art collection as a means of popular happiness and public culture has been so clearly shown in Melbourne that one or two other towns of the colony have of late years made a stout effort to supply themselves with local institutions. Ballarat was the first. In 1869 it had inaugurated a loan exhibition in its Mechanics' Institute, and on several other occasions fairly good collections of pictures were gathered in temporary exhibitions. But in 1884 a movement was set on foot for the formation of a small but choice permanent collection, and in May 1887 the Ballarat Fine Art Public Gallery Association was formed. It provided funds of its own, but the Government also granted \u00a32000 for the purchase of pictures, and already the nucleus is forming of a worthy collection. Sandhurst was a year or two later in making the same effort, but pictures are being purchased, and provision being made for housing them, and if the movement spreads to other towns, Victoria will rapidly assume a creditable position in regard to a taste for, and an appreciation of the elevating pleasures of art."], [528, "THE GREAT ORGAN IN THE MELBOURNE TOWN HALL CHAPTER XXVII. fIDusic anb tbe IDrama. MUSIC. Ma IP-I X the very early days, while Melbourne was still \"The Settlement,\" there was a strong \u2022^a t/P^l inclination to evening gaiety. The pioneers on a winter's night splashed through the gag v\u2014 <a| fields and scrambled over fences to reach each other's houses for balls and parties, while as yet the streets were not even cleared of timber ; and concerts among these social spirits formed a feature from the very dawn of settlement. Any moderately spacious shed behind a store at once became an impromptu concert hall ; and a little later the larger rooms of the hotels were weekly the scenes wherein the local amateur talent was sure of a ready applause from gathered neighbours and business friends. At the beginning of 1840, however, the generally lugubrious performances at a ball given by the \" Bachelors of Melbourne \" suggested the formation of a society, to] which was given the name of the Philharmonic. It was to possess an orchestra, but the absence of instruments was a little difficulty, and it was not till after the receipt of a supply from Sydney that the operations of the society commenced. The year 1840 was nearing its end ere the mingled groans of a somewhat capricious violoncello and several key-defying violins broke the evening stillness of the rural township. Towards the end of that year there came our first professionals, Monsieur and Madame Gautrot, from Sydney, at whose first concert, on 18th December 1840, the Philharmonic volunteered their services as an orchestra, and performed with an effect that"], [529, "MUSIC AND THE DRAMA. 507 was truly startling. The Gautrots remained nearly a year in Melbourne, and ere they left the general level of music had distinctly improved. In 1841 there were several good concerts given by Mr. Isaac Nathan, a musician of repute, who was coming from England to settle in Sydney, but called in at Port Phillip on his way. The largest hall in Melbourne was then that which John Thomas Smith had built adjoining his Adelphi Hotel in Flinders-lane. At Mr. Nathan's performances, it was crowded out into the lane with an audience delighted beyond measure once more to hear the tones of a master. As Melbourne continued to grow, its musical entertainments took a higher form. Mr. Anderson (from Sydney), Mr. Megson (who was the orchestra of the little theatre), and other professionals gave frequent and often excellent concerts. The Philharmonic produced portions of oratorios, and the Wesleyans gave organ recitals on the instrument which they had procured for their chapel in Collins-street \u2014 the first of the colony ; while a few enthusiasts, who called themselves \" The Melbourne Band,\" gave open-air performances on the Flagstaff Hill. All these were indications that Melbourne was a music-loving town ; and this fact became still clearer when, in 1849, Mr. Buddee \u2014 a new arrival from Berlin \u2014 formed his \"German Quartette,\" which he accompanied in many pleasant soirees, he himself contributing pianoforte pieces of a standard not till that time experienced in the colony. The singing class of the Mechanics' Institute gave periodic concerts of a pleasant character, with Mrs. Testar in the leading parts, but in 1851 the highest level of musical effect till then attained was reached in the series of concerts organised by Mr. Wilkie, whose music warehouse in Collins-street was of itself an important feature in the musical education of the community. How long the process would have gone on with a steady movement upward it would be hard to say ; but at the close of 185 1 the inrush of the army of gold-seekers for a time overwhelmed these quiet and cultivating pursuits. Mr. Buddee continued to \" electrify his audience,\" and Mrs. Testar to \" charm her hearers,\" but they were in the background. The main public fact was that the gold-digging flood loved the extravagances of the music-halls and casinos, or the mad excitements of Rowe's American circus. Yet the fame of the gold discoveries brought artists whose performances found audiences that grew larger as the community recovered from its period of unrest. First came Herr Strebinger, who gave a series of concerts in 1853, and subsequently settled down in Melbourne ; and in the next year Madame Carandini crossed from Tasmania, and won the popular heart by her tasteful singing. In that year also, came Herr Elsasser, and the steady increase of musical talent was shown by the fact that for the performance of the \" Messiah,\" given in the Exhibition building, an orchestra of thirty-five performers was collected. In 1855 all other musical efforts in the colony were eclipsed by the arrival of the first of a long line of stars of world-wide celebrity. The Hungarian violinist, Miska Hauser, evening after evening filled to overflowing the Queen's Theatre with an audience who hung entranced on the lightest stroke of his bow. The welcome he received showed that outside of the rougher crowd of diggers there had come to the colony abundance of men and women who were capable of appreciating good music, and prepared to support it. The poor old Philharmonic, however, had perished in the stormy times of the gold-diggers, but out of its ashes sprang a new one in 1853, under the leadership of Mr. Russell. From that year onward the society has never failed on Good Friday evening each year to produce the \" Messiah,\" and on Christmas night some other well-known oratorio ; while occasional performances of cantatas, symphonies, and minor works have had a most salutary influence upon musical taste. For years past the society has gathered its voices and its instruments around the"], [530, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 508 baton os David Lee, who has rendered an additional service to the cause of music by his recitals, twice every week, upon the Town Hall organ, one of the finest in the world ; an instrument which was opened in 1872, after being completed at a total cost of \u00a36500. There had been in very early times an effort to provide the citizens of Melbourne with the delights of Italian opera. But the attempt had been premature, and the performances most melancholy failures. At length, in 1855, there came the prima donna Catherine Hayes, whose voice of sweet, true, sympathetic quality had made her famous in every Anglo-Saxon community. So eagerly had she been expected that her appearance privately in one of the boxes of the new Theatre Royal was the signal for the most tumultuous applause. She gave a concert in the Exhibition building, and roused her hearers to a warmth of enthusiasm never before experienced in Melbourne. But what was the delight when, practically for the first time, an opera was given in the Theatre Royal on the 22nd October 1855. It was \"La Sonnambula,\" and Catherine Hayes sang the plaintive woes of the hapless Amina ; she was supported by Madame Carandini and a fairly satisfactory company, while a chorus of fifty voices had been drilled into reasonable efficiency considering the rawness of the material. Then, for the first time on Victorian soil, there was a corner where 3000 people together lived an hour or two of exquisite delight in that ideal world which the composer's art can create. In rapid succession the company produced \"Lucia di Lammermoor\" and \"Norma,\" the \"Bohemian Girl\" and \"Lucrezia Borgia\" and the opera-goer of bygone times in Europe could feel that he was not wholly shut off from the delights of civilisation. And when Catherine Hayes departed amid universal regret, she had so well shown how ready in the colony was the response to worthy enterprise that for a quarter of a century thereafter not a year passed by without its opera season. In 1856 Madame Carandini, Signor Borsotti, and Madame Cailly provided a series of representations that were fairly satisfactory. Then George Coppin entered into the speculation, and brought to the colony Madame Anna Bishop, who attracted great audiences both for concert and for opera. In 1858 an opera season commenced in the Princess Theatre, and in 1859 another in the Theatre Royal, in both of which Farquharson appeared with Madame Carandini and Walter Sherwin. Again, in 1860, there was another season at the Theatre Royal, in which the Bianchi company presented a long roll of English and Italian operas in a very creditable manner. The visits of occasional stars, and the general enthusiasm caused by the frequent and excellent production of operas, stimulated the musical talent that was latent in the colony, and in suburbs and in country-towns there were formed musical unions, glee clubs, madrigal associations, and local philharmonic societies, so that the cultivation of music began to be quite a feature of the colony as it emerged from out its golden era. In 1861 there arrived a man to whom the colony owes a heavy debt of gratitude\u2014 William Saurin Lyster. He had visited Melbourne as a rover in 1842, but had gone off again, and adopted the profession of an actor. He had subsequently found a more congenial sphere of action as an impressario, and formed his first opera company in 1857, with Madame Lucy Escott as prima donna. After a long tour in America he brought the company to Melbourne, and in 1861 opened with the \"Bohemian Girl.\" The mounting of the piece and the general efficiency of the performance immediately made the enterprise popular ; and opera after opera in the same excellent style both pleased the people and profited the manager. He resolved to make Australia his home, and for nineteen years he continued to supply the colonies with a long succession of artistic novelties. In 1869 he brought to Melbourne Signora Barratti, along with Lucy Chambers, a native of Sydney, who had gone to Europe and there acquired considerable fame. A very fine company was formed with these"], [531, "MUSLC AND THE DRAMA. 509 ladies in the principal parts, and with Armes Beaumont as tenor, a singer whom Lyster had previously brought to the colony, and whose exquisitely sweet and melting voice hushed many a great audience into that thrilling silence which bursts at length into storms of passionate applause. In 1867, when only a new-comer in the colony, he had had the misfortune, in a shooting expedition to lose one of his eyes by an accident, and no man could have been the object of a tenderer sympathy than he had been. The profession gave him a benefit concert in consideration of his long illness, and the most powerful combination of talent Australia had ever seen filled the new Exhibition building to overflowing with a sympathetic audience. Lyster had brought to the colony, along with Madame Anna Bishop, the accomplished flautist, Julius Siede, whom he now employed as conductor of this new venture, which was the finest opera company till then gathered in Australia. In 1871 Lyster introduced Signor and Signora Coy to the musical public at that iron structure, fast growing of disreputable aspect, the Princess Theatre ; but in 1873, having become lessee of the Opera House, in Bourke-street, he produced what was undoubtedly his triumph, the \"Lohengrin,\" of Wagner, with Antonietta Link as Elsa, and Signor Paladini in the hero's part. It was superbly mounted, and the orchestra was good ; the singers were all possessed of sweet voices, and the whole was woven together with so much feeling and good taste as to make this, the first rendering of Wagner in Australia, an event to be dreamt of for a lifetime thereafter. The seasons of 1879 and 1880, when Lyster brought Signora Boema and Signor Verdi before the Melbourne public, proved to be his last, for at the end of 1880 he died, and left the colony under a debt of gratitude to him for a long series of pleasures that were refined and elevating. The number of artists he brought to the colony was surprisingly great, comprising, in addition to those mentioned, Susini, Dondi, and Rosnati, Alice May, Emilie Melville, Madame Simonsen and her husband, Martin Simonsen, the excellent violinist. There was for six years an interval during which the Melbourne public was practically without opera, the only attempt that was made being in every way a failure. But in 1887 Martin Simonsen brought out to the Alexandra Theatre an opera company which undoubtedly excelled all other efforts ; not so much in the voices of the singers, for there were previous companies which left little to be desired in that way, but rather in the completeness of the effect, the orchestral portion indicating to a very marked degree the steady improvement of music as an art in the colony. The lighter operas, requiring few resources for their production, were omitted, and only those more elaborate ones were produced whose grand tonal effects had prevented their appearance, or at least their complete appearance at an earlier date. Melbourne has therefore in the past witnessed the finest works of Rossini, Verdi, Donizetti, and Bellini, together with the operatic gems of Mozart, Meyerbeer, and Weber, produced with an excellence of singing, orchestration, and mounting which make it a curious speculation to anticipate how far the next attempt will be able to improve upon them. Outside of operatic representation Melbourne has enjoyed occasional opportunities of hearing high-class music produced in those massive effects which are to be obtained by '\u25a0 Musical Festivals.\" The first was held in 1867, under the management of C. E. Horsley, a composer of some repute, who had taken up his residence in the colony. He succeeded in gathering an orchestra of sixty performers and a chorus of 300 voices, with Madame Carandini and her two charming daughters, Fanny and Rosina, and also with Walter Sherwin and other well-trained voices, for the solo parts. Joseph Summers acted as organist, and with a musical force under his command that exceeded all other colonial efforts, he produced a series of classic works somewhat surprising in a community only"], [532, "VLCTORLA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 510 thirty years old \u2014 Mendelssohn's \" Hymn of Praise,\" his \" Elijah,\" and his \" Scotch Symphonies,\" Mozart's \"Jupiter,\" Handel's \"Messiah,\" and also a masque entitled \"The South Sea Sisters,\" written by R. H. Home, and composed by Horsley himself. A still finer effort was made in 1872, when another festival was held in connection with the International Exhibition of that year, under the guidance of Signor Giorza. Some high-class music was there produced, with the young Tasmanian soprano, Amy Sherwin, and Miss Christian, Mrs. Cutter, and Signor Susini as principal soloists. These successive \" Festivals \" served as tide-marks to indicate at what rate the development of music was progressing, and as they did not occur too often it was gratifying to observe on successive occasions how much the taste and the skill of the community was improving. In 1882 came the last, and by far the finest effort of the kind, when for a week together great audiences met in the vast main hall of the Exhibition building of 1880, to hear the noblest works produced by a grand combination of talent under the general leadership of Julius Herz. The orchestra contained 113 performers, the chorus numbered about 1000 voices, and 13 singers of high reputation took the solo parts. Six organists in turn took their places at the vast organ of the Exhibition hall ; six conductors relieved one another in a long succession of oratorios, cantatas, symphonies, and minor works. At this festival the noblest instrumental production till then heard in Victoria was the successful rendering of Beethoven's \" Ninth Symphony,\" a stupendous work which succeeding efforts will doubtless produce in still finer style, but the very attempt at which marked the strong development of musical taste. Melbourne has always been fortunate in visits of isolated stars \u2014 chiefly those who, on the pianoforte or the violin, have been successful in winning a name in Europe. Arabella Goddard came twice to the colony, and with her wayward genius* enchanted the lovers of music. Ketten over and over again gathered vast audiences, to hang with a rapturous suspense over the sad yet playful sweetness of Chopin. Kowalski banged his spirit-stirring marches out of many a grand piano. Herr Kohler and Madame Schiller have given delicious rendering to that world of beauty which the heaven-born artist can reveal from out those masses of dots and lines which form the printed pages of Schubert and Schumann, Liszt and Chopin. Some of the best of these wandering stars wandered no longer, but settled down in our midst. Herr Louis Pabst, a pianist of tender gracefulness, and a composer whose name ought one day to be known ; Mr. T. H. Guenett, who not only was of immense service in the cultivation of pianoforte playing, but also deserves the thanks of the colony for his long series of \"popular concerts,\" which have been unpopular enough to cause him the loss of a good deal of money, but where, once a week for season after season, the lovers of music could hear the stringed works of Beethoven, Mozart, Haydn, Schubert, Schumann, Mendelssohn, and others produced with delightful effect by Weston, and Jager, and Curtis, and Cope and Zerbini, and the 'cellist artist Reimers. Among violinists whose names are treasured in the memories of music-lovers were Wilhelmj in 1881, and Remenyi in 1885, with Jenny Claus, and, perhaps, most interesting of all, John Kruse. This last example of genius was Victorian-born ; a Melbourne lad whose violin playing exhibited so many indications of future mastery that the musical world in the colony took an interest in him, and by concerts and subscriptions raised a fund for sending him to Berlin for the perfecting of his education, where, under the tuition of the world's famous masters, he rapidly achieved all the success that had been anticipated for him. He returned in 1885 to show his patrons how far he had progressed, and in June"], [533, "MUSLC AND THE DRAMA. 511 of that year an enthusiastic audience packed the Town Hall to hear the pure tones and cultivated execution of a native-born performer who had risen to be almost the equal of the most accomplished visitors. The progress of musical development in Victoria has been greatly fostered by the formation of Liedertafels, or clubs of men's voices. The first of these was an association formed by some Germans. It called itself the Melbourner Deutsche Liedertafel, and devoted itself to the practice of those richly harmonised and gracefully tuneful part songs in which the Teuton genius so long has had the pre-eminence. Under the leadership of Herr Siede it has increased its resources, though losing its distinctively German character and title ; and its long series of concerts, nearly two hundred in number, have reached an ever ascending standard of excellence, both in the class of composition attempted, and in the finish of the execution. But the Metropolitan Liedertafel, though now closely pressed by its earlier rival, greatly exceeded the latter in strength and resources. It took its origin in 1870 as a mere suburban glee club at South Yarra, but under the guidance of Julius Herz has become a notable feature in the music of the colony. More than a hundred concerts of varied character, but of uniformly classical standard, have yielded an amount of pleasure and benefit which could scarcely be estimated too highly. Whether at one of its grand Town Hall concerts, when every two or three months a vast audience of nearly three thousand persons, all in evening dress, fills the handsome hall, to hear the noblest fragments of majestic works produced with impressive effect, amid stately surroundings; or at the familiar \"smoke nights,\" when, amid curling wreaths of tobacco smoke, and with the intervals filled by the clink of glasses, the audience of men that occupies the sawdust-strewn floor of the Athen\u00e6um listens to the cheerful choruses of the Fatherland, or the sterling old English glees or the part songs of modern writers; in either case the music given is of the finest class, and is worthily rendered. With these and other agencies at work, Victoria has acquired the right to regard itself as a community not less musical in its tastes and tendencies than the most favoured people of other lands. THE DRAMA. The lively community of speculative, active, enterprising people who formed the population of Melbourne in 1840 were not likely to exist for any length of time without sighing for the delights of the drama. Accordingly, in that year, we find no less than three distinct societies formed for amateur theatricals. In 1841 two halls were opened in connection with publichouses for occasional entertainments of that class \u2014 the Victoria Saloon and the Pavilion. The latter obtained, in 1842, a license as a theatre for a period extending to three months, and became, for the time being, the \"Theatre Royal\" of Melbourne. Here was produced \"The Ticket of Leave \" and \" The Lottery Ticket,\" under Mr. Buckingham as stage manager. Performances took place on Mondays and Thursdays, the small hall being dingily lighted by a couple of modest lamps ; the bare and barren little stage being free from any trace of carpet, and the scenery exhibiting a most primitive character. Whatever little illusion there was must have been destroyed after the opening night by the frequent extrusion of a head through the scenery for the purpose of taking stock of the audience. At the end of the three months' term a license for a year was issued, and the place became the \" Royal Victoria Theatre.\" As it had more the aspect of a stable, however, than of a theatre, and a couple of constables were steadily employed for the purpose of ejecting intoxicated shepherds and stockmen, who were in town demolishing their cheques, it never attracted any of the more respectable population of the town during the course Vol. I. 3 N"], [534, "VLCTORLA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 512 of this second license, and it was with unalloyed satisfaction that the theatre-goers of Melbourne. saw the materials go up Queen-street in frequent carts to form the first properly-constructed theatre of the colony.1 It was the property of John Thomas Smith, who announced that it was to be constructed on a scale of splendour never surpassed in Australia. The opening play was \" Black-Eyed Susan,\" in which Mr. Nesbitt, as William, introduced to the Melbourne public those talents which had for so long been the delight of the Theatre Royal in Liverpool. The same actor, who was also manager, subsequently produced \"Richard IIP,\" which was the first performance of any of Shakspeare's dramas on Victorian soil. But the season was by no means a success. The management seems to have been unable to cope with many difficulties, and it very often happened that the curtain failed to rise until after nine o'clock, when the audience had grown weary and uproarious. But the drama began to assume a more hopeful aspect on the advent of George Coppin in June 1845. He had immigrated to Sydney in 1843, whence he had found his way to Tasmania, but hearing there was an opening in Melbourne, a place with io.oco inhabitants, yet without a properly-conducted theatre, he made the bold experiment of bringing with him a company of twelve performers, a scene painter, and five musicians, with whom to give a dramatic season in Melbourne. His first piece was the \" Lady of Lyons,\" in which he was supported by Mr. and Mrs. Charles Young; and as he had a little money to spend in mounting his pieces fairly well, and spent it in a judicious way, he had a successful time during his one-year lease of the Queen's Theatre. With the profits of this enterprise he built a small theatre in Adelaide, and remained for several years in that city. Meanwhile the Queen's Theatre in Melbourne was leased by Morton King, who associated with himself a Sydney actor named Ward in the production of \"Hamlet,\" \"Macbeth,\" \"Romeo and Juliet,\" and other dramas of Shakspeare, while the company was strengthened by the presence of J. P. Hydes, long a most popular comedian in Melbourne and in Sydney. In this manner, and with a wholesome variety of enter tainment, the Queen's Theatre, then the only one in Melbourne, was carried on for four years, till at the beginning of 1851 it passed into the hands of Charles Young. It was during his management that the gold fever broke out. He announced that \"in consequence of the great furore created by the recent discoveries, and having a slight touch of the gold fever him- Sdf'\" he W\u00b0uld Produce a Piece cal-ed \" The Gold-Seekers,\" adapted from the Italian. But, however he attempted to accom m\u00b0date himself to the troubles of the times, he could scarcely keep the theatre going* When actors and workmen, and super numeraries, all were to be seen, with bundle on back, posting out on the road to the diggings, the performances in town be became most intermittent. In 1852, however, the actors mostly returned. Professional talent became abundant, and the man- THE HON. GEORGE COPPIN ager began to reap his harvest. Crowds of successful diggers came back to town and when money was so plentiful, the theatre was in demand. The lucky man from Bendigo wanted to treat some mate, or he must take a lady friend to enjoy an evening's outing. These folks mono polised the dress circle. A digger crowd filled the cushioned seats, and passed the rum bottle 1 gee engraving, p. 198,"], [535, "MUSIC AND THE DRAMA. 513 with easy grace from mouth to mouth. In their more hilarious periods it was impossible to proceed. They joked Ophelia about her appearance ; poked fun at the ghost; and offered Hamlet a pull at the bottle to cheer his dismal spirits. They laughed heartily at each other's sallies. They shouted greetings across the house, and made the noisiest of audiences. But the uproar was mostly good-humoured, and sprang from the fervour of the times ; and as the diggers crowded the theatre and paid whatever prices were demanded, the manager was able to meet the heavy salaries required for all his employes, and yet had a little profit for himself. Coppin had been in time for some of these prosperous days, though the first result of the gold-fever had been to ruin his prospects in Adelaide. There had been built in 1847 a weatherboard theatre in Geelong to seat 500 persons. He took over this place in 1852, enlarged and improved it, and such was the bustle of Geelong in those days, and such the throng of lucky diggers, that in two years he had once more gathered a little fortune. He retired to England to enjoy it. But he was too restless and energetic to withdraw from active life so soon, being then only thirty-five. The possibilities in Melbourne were very great, and the field lay practically open. He resolved to introduce the very finest talents to Australia, and made arrangements with G. V. Brooke, the most accomplished exponent of Shakspeare then living, to visit Victoria. And other members of a first-rate company were engaged by the courageous manager, whose faith in Melbourne was unbounded. But in his former experiences of that city his main trouble had arisen from the fact that there had been but one theatre, whose proprietor had exacted an unreasonable rent even in those quiet days before the gold excitement. What he was likely to demand now, when everything had increased in price, it would be difficult to guess. Coppin therefore resolved to carry out a theatre with him. It duly arrived, and its walls of iron soon appeared, rising in less than six weeks at the corner of Lonsdale and Stephen streets. Coppin called it the \" Olympic,\" but to the people it was universally known as the \"Iron-Pot.\" But until this new place should be ready, Coppin leased the Queen's Theatre, and there delighted a boisterous audience beyond all measure when he appeared as Paul Pry with his shabby umbrella, and hoped \" he didn't intrude.\" But the public knew that G. V. Brooke was on his way, the greatest English actor since the days of the elder Kean ; and there was a time of anxious expectation. At length came the eventful 26th of February 1855, when the dramatic genius of Shakspeare was to display all the scope it offers to the powers of the actor. The theatre might have been packed again and again with the crowds who sought to find entrance. The play chosen was \"Othello,\" with Fanny Cathcart as Desdemona, Mrs. Charles Young as Emilia, and J. P. Hydes as Roderigo. When the swarthy Moor, with his attendant train of torchbearers, stepped on the stage, listening to the lying words of Iago, while all the streets of Venice were resounding with the tumult of Brabantio's followers, when his manly step advanced towards the foot-lights, a wild ovation took place, and it was only after a long delay that the play could proceed. At the conclusion of the act Brooke was compelled to come forward, and, amid great cheering and waving of handkerchiefs, he thanked them for their welcome, and confessed that he could not realise that he was so far from home. From that day onward Brooke was installed as a prime hero in the Victorian heart ; his generous temper, his manly character, joined to the fire and the complete self-forgetfulness of his acting, won the heartiest goodwill of all who knew him, a goodwill that his unfortunate weakness for wine, and his heavy losses in business, did not diminish ; and the last scene of all, that final act to the real tragedy of a rtoble life, when he was returning to the colony for another season, and took his passage in the London,"], [536, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLLS: PAST AND PRESENT. 514 deepened the impression of his memory in Melbourne. There, in the Bay of Biscay, while the seas rolled like moving mountains, to which the overladen steamer rose ever less and less buoyantly; there, when the hope of safety was gone for all but the few who found a place in the long-boat, he disdained to make another to crowd the little craft. Standing calmly by the companion-ladder, he waved a cheerful adieu to those in the boat, as the mighty iron structure settled down to her long descent into the gloomy ocean depths below. This was the tragic ending of a life that in 1855 was all brightness \u2014 when, night after night, Hamlet, and Shylock, and Richard III., Virginius, and Richelieu, and a host of other characters, sustained in superb combinations of dignity, passion, and pathos, made the name of G. V. Brooke the most popular in Victoria. Old playgoers felt their hearts swell with emotion at witnessing such scenes as they never dreamt they could witness again after leaving the shores of Old England. Brooke went to Sydney, and on his return found the Olympic ready for him, and there he continued his triumphs. But as yet Victoria had no theatre at all worthy of it ; till in 1855 the Theatre Royal was built by Mr. John Black, who had in the previous three years made a fortune as a carrier on the roads to the diggings. His drays had been well known, the long lines that left Melbourne and Geelong being generally regarded as an institution of the country; and when the rates that ruled were from \u00a330 to \u00a3100 per ton, the profits made were such as succeeding generations might well sigh for, as a glory of the past. All these profits Mr. Black sank in the establish ment of a theatre to hold 3000 persons, lavishly appointed, with splendid scenery, a mag nificent stage, and dresses and properties which up to the opening night had already cost a little fortune. Mel bourne was as yet not lit with gas, and Black had his own retorts set up, and sup plied his theatre with a brilliant illumination, con trasting very finely with the lugubrious dimness of the Olympic. Unfortunately for Mr. Black, the brilliancy of talent was under the control of Coppin, for in the Olym pic, not only G. V. Brooke, but also Julia Matthews, Fanny Cathcart, Mr. and Mrs. Robert Heir, with the popular Coppin himself, produced play after play with astonishing effect. G. V. BROOKE. The Theatre Royal was opened on 6th July 1855. The piece was \"The School for Scandal,\" with G. H. Rogers as Sir Peter and Mrs. Poole as Lady Teazle. Before the gas-footlights \u2014unprecedented glory\u2014 there gathered a good orchestra, under Herr Strebinger. A prologue had been written by W. M. Akehurst, to be delivered by Lady Teazle. It was after nine o'clock before that lady advanced to the footlights, but no one seemed to weary, for the general admiration of this new Drury-lane of the Southern Hemisphere kept all in occupation and good spirits. The house was crowded on this its first night, but Black subsequently made a mistake in bringing forward as his first attraction the notorious Lola Monies. Her bold and adventurous career, the meretricious glamour of a scandalous life, had made her well known, but Black was altogether astray in his reckoning when he imagined that mere notoriety would fill his great theatre night after night. Her conduct in Melbourne was more than equivocal, and the people looked coldly on her free and easy defiance of propriety ; and as she had no capacity as an actress, Mr."], [537, "MUSIC AND THE DRAMA. 515 Black steadily went down that hill which leads to a resting-place at its foot in the Insolvency Court. Lola Montes went off to the diggings, where she found a large enough section of the miners to admirs her. Her graceful foot, which she displayed in some really elegant dancing, her jolly manner among the digger audiences, the fact that she fought a stand-up fight with a sister-actress, and that she horsewhipped an editor who commented on her proceedings, gathered a crowd of stalwart fellows who vowed that she was the right sort, and made her Ballarat and Sandhurst seasons quite a success ; she was invited to christen mines and to lay foundation stones, and generally she figured as the heroine of the hour. Meanwhile, in Melbourne another place of amusement had been erected. The success of Rowe's circus in 1852 induced G. B. W. Lewis to enter permanently into that class of entertainment. In 1854 he built, in Spring-street, opposite the Parliament House, a building of corrugated iron, which he called Astley's Ampitheatre. There, with a fine stud of horses, he played \"Dick Turpin,\" and \" Mazeppa,\" and \" El Hyder, the Chief of the Ghaut Mountains.\" Thus, with Catherine Hayes in opera at the Royal, Brooke at the Olympic, and horses at Astley's, Melbourne was well provided with amusements in that era of gold. But Coppin was clearly the only manager capable of conducting the Theatre Royal with success, and in 1856 he carried thither the whole of his fine company. He opened with Goldsmith's \"She Stoops to Conquer,\" and his delineation of Tony Lumpkin kept the house in a condition of the utmost good-humour. Then came a magnificent Shakspearian season, when to great audiences, and with improved resources, Brooke continued his splendid impersonations with undiminished success. He tried, however, some novelties, which left no profit ; such a drama as Byron's \" Sardanapalus\" was unsuited for acting, and though Brooke took the title role, and played with rare refinement, the character was found too little susceptible of dramatic boldness, and financial losses began to accumulate. But \" Sardanapalus\" had the distinction of being the first profusely-mounted piece of Australia. Its magnificent scenery first brought into notice the great talent of Hennings, to whose brush the public of Melbourne have since then owed so many an hour in foreign lands or in fairy scenes. Meantime John Black had not been daunted by his want of success at the Theatre Royal. He still burned to make a mark as a manager, and he took over from Lewis, in 1857, the Amphitheatre in Spring-street, and converted it into the Princess Theatre, but he did not long retain his position of command. The control of the place passed to the Misses Gougenheim, who engaged the Shakspearian actor Hoskins, and by his fine acting, their own talent, and a policy of spirited enterprise, raised the poor-looking structure into a scene of almost constant dramatic triumph. Coppin felt his supremacy threatened, and went to England for the purpose of securing fresh stars, but the only result of the trip was the engagement of Helen Mortyn, who for two years was a constant favourite till her mysterious death brought to an end a histrionic career of great promise. At the end of 1858 George Coppin, now grown to be a man of property, and one endowed with indomitable pluck and determination in risking his means for the development of colonial enterprise, was elected to a seat in the Legislative Council, and G. V. Brooke bought up his share of the partnership in the Theatre Royal, thus becoming full proprietor. At the same time the Princess Theatre changed hands, the management being assumed by J. R. Greville, the droll and genial comedian. Brooke constantly attracted large houses, and his production of \" Louis XI.,\" and of the \"Comedy of Errors,\" were remarkable triumphs, both dramatically and financially. But he made a poor manager. His easy open-handed generosity allowed expenses to multiply,"], [538, "516 VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. and he had no notion of reserving the surplus of a popular run to make good the deficit of a dull season. In less than two years his theatre and his properties, even his very wardrobe, were in the hands of the money lenders, and he was \u00a34000 in debt. Indeed, at one performance the gas would have been turned off by the inexorable gas company, and the audience left to enjoy themselves in darkness, had not Coppin stepped forward to assist his friend, and paid the long over-due bill. Brooke used to convulse the audiences at the Royal with the shifts and dodges of Felix O'Callaghan when on \" His Last Legs.\" He had a few months' experience of the same style of thing in actual life. Yet in this, his period of difficulty, his own acting, and the effectiveness with which the stage was managed, exceeded anything ever known in the colonies, and when Sir William and Lady Don joined him, a company was gathered such as Australia has never witnessed since. When \" The Rivals\" was produced, with Brooke as Sir Lucius and Coppin as Bob Acres, and Lady Don as Lydia Languish, Robert Heir as Captain Absolute, Sir William Don as Fag, Richard Young as Falkland, Harwood as David, and W. H. Wallack as Sir Anthony, that charming play was probably never performed in a happier vein in any part of the world. But Brooke was unable to continue his management, and retired in sore disappointment. He went back to England, where he again recovered himself to some extent by his inimitable powers. In 1866 he purposed to return to Melbourne and try his fortune there once more, but unfortunately he took his passage in that fine new iron steamer the London, which was then making its first voyage, and Victoria never again saw his popular features. Meanwhile Holt and Hoskins took the man agement of the Theatre Royal, but after a few months suffered it to pass into the hands of J. W. Wilton, who made his term remarkable by his introduc tion of Barry Sullivan to the colony. That actor was by no means the equal of Brooke, but he was at least a capable and power ful interpreter of Shaks peare, and for some months he attracted great audi ences. When he departed for Sydney, Lyster occu pied the Theatre Royal for some time with the first of his fine opera troupes ; and when that had lasted five months Barry Sullivan returned and himself as sumed the management of the theatre.1 BARRY SULLIVAN Meantime George Coppin had of necessity returned to his old life of enterprise and had built a new theatre, which he called the Haymarket, next to the Eastern Market. It was opened on the 15th September 1862, and during the next year he succeeded in bringing out to it the great stars, Mr. and Mrs. Charles Kean. That was a season of theatrical excitement, for just about the same time the truly fascinating actor Joseph Jefferson came to Melbourne on an engagement to the Princess Theatre, and whilst he night after night for long weeks won alternate tears and laughter from crowded audiences with the woes and the drolleries of Rip Van Winkle, Barry Sullivan, in the Theatre Royal, gave a most impressive rendering of Hamlet, with Josephine Gougenheim as Ophelia, and at that very time Charles Kean and his wife were busy at the Haymarket with drama after drama of the highest Shakspearian level."], [539, "MUSIC AND THE DRAMA. 517 And when that exciting period was over ; when Kean, and Sullivan, and Jefferson were gone, the interest in the drama was still sustained by the visit of Walter Montgomery, who gave magnificent renderings of \" Macbeth,\" and \" Othello,\" and a long series of the noblest conceptions of Shakspeare ; infusing into his interpretations a dignity, and yet a subdued intensity of feeling that carried his audience out of the work-a-day world, and left them, as midnight turned them back into the streets, to wake from the wonders of a dream-world. But there was at that time also a second series of Shakspearian dramas going forward. For Coppin, who had tried a sea son of commonplace produc tions with Madame Celeste for principal performer, now brought out to the Hay market the capable actor James Anderson for a sea son of the legitimate drama. He was by no means as accomplished an actor as Montgomery, but the two, by their rivalry, added each to the other's audiences, and Melbourne formed the scene of much speculation, much discussion, much par tisanship in regard to their different interpretations of the same characters. This occurred about the time of Prince Alfred's visit, and what with the gaiety of the time, what with the attrac tions of the rival actors, Mel bourne had never till then beheld so lively a season for the drama. WALTER MONTGOMERY. It was followed by a lull ; Coppin, who has in all brought into the colony some two hundred theatrical stars, had none on hand to maintain the fortunes of the Haymarket. It continued empty for week after week. He had it carefully renovated, and rechristened it the Duke of Edinburgh Theatre ; but after five years of unpropitious seasons, during a large part of which it was only occasionally opened, it was burnt down towards the end of 187 1, to the sorrow of none but the insurance companies. The Theatre Royal meantime had passed once more into the hands of Coppin, who, in 1869, after a two-years' lull, commenced a Shakspearian revival with Herr Bandmann as prime attraction. His performances were very creditable, but to a public filled with memories of Brooke and Sullivan, and Kean and Montgomery, and Anderson, his conceptions of the giant characters of the drama proved to be only moderately satisfying. But Coppin made a distinct success when he introduced Mr. and Mrs. Charles Matthews ; those cultured actors trod the stage with an air that seemed so little like acting that even the veteran playgoer, after being carried away by the illusion, could experience that startling sensation of the school-girl at her first play, who suddenly comes to her senses, and remembers that it is all a fiction. When they departed, the Theatre Royal saw a sorry season of melodramas; but shortly after the destruction of the Haymarket, it suffered the same fate, being burnt to the ground in 1872. Thus Melbourne had but the one theatre left, that shabby iron structure known as the Princess Theatre, in which, however, the lighter operas, \" Der Freischutz,\" \" Martha,\" \" Maritana,\" and so forth were performed, with Armes Beaumont and Alice May in the leading parts. A new theatre was built in the course of the year by Henry Hoyt. He chose the site of the Varieties, a music-hall in Bourke-street, and there he raised the Prince of Wales Opera House, which was opened on 24th August 1872, when Dion Boucicault's lively drama, \" London Assurance,\" was produced under the direction of Mrs. Mary Gladstone. Herr Habbe's"], [540, "518 VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. decorations and scenery were not quite finished, and the place was still in the hands of carpenters and painters, but the opening performance was most successfully completed in presence of a dense and enthusiastic crowd. Within four months the Theatre Royal was rebuilt on a more magnificent scale than had ever been attempted in the colonies. It was the property of a partnership consisting of Harwood, Stewart, Hennings, and Coppin, which, with the substitution of Greville for Stewart, maintained this theatre in a creditable position for ten or twelve years. But for a long time the glories of the legiti mate drama were gone, and both the Royal and the Opera House found it necessary to produce the works of Offenbach, Lecocq, and Arthur Sullivan, together with a spicy class of sensational dramas, which were well-mounted and agree ably rendered. The higher class of dramas requires the interpretation of genius to make it tolerable on the stage. A tawdry performance of \" Macbeth\" is a positive source of annoyance, and as the supply of genius is necessarily limited, the stage managers do well, when they find they cannot give an adequate representation of first-class work, to secure at least a thoroughly efficient rendering of second-class productions. But in 1 875 the tragic muse herself visited the colonies in the person of Madame"], [541, "MUSIC AND THE DRAMA. 519 Ristori, who, though she performed in Italian, along with the company of Italian actors she had brought with her, occasioned the most unqualified enthusiasm. Her stately figure, her marvellous power of flashing into the mind of the spectator, by a slight and seemingly trivial gesture, look, or emphasis, a whole train of absorbing thoughts and suggestions, placed her at once in a region far above even Brooke or Montgomery, and secured her a ready recognition as the most transcendent genius who has ever trod the stage in Australia. Her impersonation of Marie Antoinette left the spectator with the impression that he had actually somehow lived in revolutionary times, and seen the awful upheavals of 1789. And so in her Mary Stuart and her Elizabeth, her Medea and her Lady Macbeth, it is difficult to conceive how any nobler interpretation could be given of these striking characters. Meantime a notable feature at the Theatre Royal had been the arrival of J. C. Williamson and his wife Maggie Moore, who contrived to invest the comparatively ordinary play of \" Struck Oil \" with an unusual degree of interest. The pathetic drollness of John Stofel and the whimsical waywardness of his daughter Lizzie drew 3000 people nightly for month after month to laugh at them, and wipe away the moistness that would insist on dimming the eyes in spite of constant laughter, and the genial actors have always been sure of a welcome in their repeated reproductions of the piece. In 1875 Arthur Garner and his wife Blanche Stammers arrived, and assisted in the production of a long series of the higher class of comedies. A triumvirate partnership, consisting of Williamson, Garner, and Musgrove, has, for the last six or seven years, been the principal caterer for public amusement in Melbourne. On 6th November 1876 the charming little theatre named the Academy of Music, seated for only 1000 persons, but elegant and tasteful in every appointment, was opened, under the management of Mrs. G. B. W. Lewis. But in the following year it was taken over by Signor Majeroni, and rechristened the Bijou. Signor Majeroni and his wife, an actress of great elegance and refinement, had visited Melbourne in Madame Ristori's company, and returned in 1876 for a season of comedies mostly adapted from the French. Among the more notable of recent productions have been Rignold's \" Henry V.,\" a very pleasing rendering of that fine historic play; Genevieve Ward's representation of Lady Macbeth; Dion Boucicault in one or two of his own ever-popular dramas ; but chief of all the delightful evenings spent beneath the spell of Frederick Marshall's genial humour, when the absurdities of Jeames, the whimsicalities of The Governor, the laughable shrewdness of Mr. Middlewick, and many other delightful impersonations, left to the spectator reminiscences that seemed to be almost those of racy humourists whom he had actually met, and whose eccentricities he had had an opportunity of laughing at in real life. In latter years two new theatres have been erected. The Alexandra is a vast place built by Jules Joubert at a very great cost, which proved the source of embarrassments heavier than he could overcome. The firm of Williamson, Garner, and Musgrove demolished the old Princess Theatre after its thirty years of chequered existence, and on its site erected a structure unrivalled, so far, in the history of Australia. From the splendour of the marble staircase that forms its entrance to the picturesque dome that crowns a noble effort of architectural design, the theatre is a marvel of completeness; its electric lights, the charming decorations of its boxes and its galleries, the elegance of its scenic appointments, the mechanism that permits the roof to roll away and suffers the spectators on a hot summer night to look up into the delicious coolness of the star-besprinkled sky, all that wealth and lavish enterprise can effect, has been poured out on this temple of the drama in Spring-street.

EDUCATION fjilHEN John Batman brought his wife and family over to \\\\/\\k Melbourne in 1836, there came with them Miss Ir^J&H Newcome to act as governess to his seven daughters. She was therefore the first teacher in Melbourne; moreover, she opened the first school; for having made the acquaintance of a Mr. Cook, and having assumed the name and dignity of Mrs. Cook, she opened a boarding-school in Flinders-street, in a small building near the site of the Fish Market. This was in 1837, immediately after the town had emerged from its original wattle-and-daub condition by reason of the sale of lands in the June of that year. Her establishment was therefore the pioneer of the education of the colony, but it was probably only one of those make - shift arrangements whereby the straitened circumstances of a household are sometimes ren dered a little easier. PROFESSOR FREDK. M'COY, F.R.S But the first day-school, on a purely business basis, was that opened a month or two later, in January 1838, by James A. Clarke. It was in connection with the Church of England ; but"], [543, "EDUCATION AND SCIENCE IN VICTORIA. 521 in accordance with the regulations then in force in New South Wales, it received from the Government assistance towards its building fund. Though the settlement then consisted of fields and gum trees, with a few sprinkled dwellings here and there, yet it provided nearly half a hundred pupils for this first school, and in three months Mr. Clarke had to obtain the services of an assistant, Mr. Abbott, at a salary of \u00a350 a-year. There, toiling in a little wooden place from which there emerged upon the sward and the unfenced glades the hum of fifty-three boys and girls, these two formed the precursors of the army of teachers that now have sway in more than two thousand schools scattered all over the colony. But ere a year was gone the Presbyterians were in the field, and with their characteristic energy they soon left their Church of England rivals far in the rear. Robert Campbell arrived, in November 1838, to open the first Presbyterian school. It was at first held in a slender structure which was only a trifle better than the open air ; but after six months the denomination called for tenders for the erection of a brick building on the land they had received as a grant on the hill in Collins-street, where now the Scots' Church stands. In a year it gathered 146 pupils, and employed an assistant named John M'Lure. By that time the Roman Catholics had also made a good start, and Thomas and Mary Lynch assisted each other with conjugal co-operation in ruling and teaching their hundred young folks, who with a merry hubbub scratched away at slates, or lay over the desks, blotting their copy-books with inkstained fingers. In 1842 they had nearly 140 pupils gathered round them. In 1 84 1 the Wesleyans made their first appearance in education with a school in Collingwood, under N. Kearnan. who had forty little ones to conduct into the mysteries of spelling-book and multiplication table. In the same year Geelong was blest with scholastic advantages, James Stewart opening with a school that soon mustered sixty pupils. Portland did not possess a school till 1842, when C. Hebditch (with the assistance of the Church of England) and J. S. Stewart (aided by the Presbyterians) opened, at almost the same time, one with twenty-six and the other with thirty-nine pupils. In Williamstown, C. Stone opened the first school in 1842 with thirty pupils. In the sanre year the Congrcgationalists commenced work in Melbourne, James Smith being their schoolmaster, with a little flock of forty around him. Thus, in 1843, the colony possessed eleven teachers who instructed 462 children, at fees ranging from is. to 2s. per week. These efforts were zealous and well meant, but there was a fragmentary character about them, and they did not provide for the instruction of more than one child in eight of those who were at the school age within the colony. The fact was that the Port Phillip district, being then a part of the colony of New South Wales, was necessarily subject to the system of that colony, which was then in a most unsettled condition. It was a most inefficient plan to allow a number of competing sects to build small and mutually jealous schools side by side, half-a-dozen of them altogether in a small town where one would have been enough, and none at all in a country district where no single denomination could secure a sufficient number of pupils to form a school of its own, and yet each was reluctant to allow its pupils to enter the school of another. The pity of all this had forcibly struck Sir Richard Bourke, who, in 1836, proposed to establish a national system on the plan of the recently organised Irish National Schools. It was an attempt to gather all the children into one set of schools, which, by combination and organisation, would become strong and efficient, religion being taught upon a uniform and unsectarian scheme, which Sir Richard fondly hoped would satisfy all denominations. But the dull opposition of the religious bodies, and indeed the active hostility of many of the clergy, caused his effort to be practically abortive, and when he left the colony his plan was still only a plan."], [544, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 522 In 1839 Sir George Gipps, on his arrival, took the matter in hand. But it was not till 1841 that he overcame the opposition of Bishop Broughton, and succeeded to the very meagre extent of supplying the three chief towns of New South Wales with a national school each upon this unscctarian system, and even then in every district the churches were still to have the right of establishing such schools as they chose, and the Government was to assist them with grants in proportion to the number of their scholars. Gipps, however, put these restrictions in force, that unless the population of a district exceeded 2000, no aid would be given to any school in it that was within five miles of another school; that no single school should receive more than \u00a3100 of State-aid ; and that no grant should be made to any school which should not submit its pupils to examination in secular subjects by a duly authorised Government inspector. This was the system under which the educational establishments of Port Phillip started their existence. One of the first things done in 1844 by the Legislative Council in Sydney after its formation was to appoint a committee to inquire into the state of education in New South Wales. That committee reported that not a half\u2014 not nearly a half\u2014 of the children of the colony were being educated, and that such as were being taught were being very poorly taught. It laid the blame of this state of things upon denominational dissensions, and recommended the introduction of Bourkc's proposal, one uniform national system of schools, wherein religious instruction should be given, but of a strictly unsectarian character. Bishop Broughton again made the most strenuous efforts to defeat the scheme, and the Roman Catholics and the Wesleyans joined the Church of England in a most determined opposition to any change. A period of agitation succeeded, and meetings for and against the new system were numerous in Sydney. The result was that although some legislation was effected, it amounted to very little. The denominations still had the practical control of education ; though a large part of the money was provided by the State. This then was the condition of affairs in Victoria when she entered upon her separate existence in 1851. In that year the schools were seventy-four in number, with 3800 scholars, \u00a33000 being contributed annually by fees, and \u00a32300 by Government. But the goldfields excitement seemed likely to make the whole affair collapse. Nine head teachers, after only a week's notice, went off to the diggings, and others sent in their formal resignations. For a space of nearly six weeks there was scarcely any tuition in the country, and then it was resumed only by placing in charge of the various schools such people as could be scraped together for the purpose. Next year a Committee of Education was appointed by the newly formed Legislative Council of Victoria. It was directed to consider and report upon some comprehensive scheme. It reported that it was useless to expect that any one system of schools, either secular or denominational, would secure the support of the bulk of the people; it would therefore be better to continue the process of subsidising such schools as submitted themselves to Government inspection, and gave four hours daily of consecutive secular instruction. Each school might give such religious instruction as it pleased, so long as it did not compel all pupils to attend or attempt any proselytising. However, to discourage the multiplication of petty schools, no Government aid was to be given to any place with less than seventy pupils in town or less than thirty pupils in the country. It also recommended the establishment of a Board of Education to found and manage model schools, wherein teachers might be trained for their profession, in place of the former practice of making teachers out of all who had failed in other callings. The Council, however, departed considerably from these suggestions. It consolidated the denominational schools as far as possible by the appointment of a Denominational Board of"], [545, "EDUCATION AND SCIENCE IN VICTORIA. 523 Education, to which a grant of \u00a320,000 was made to enable it to erect suitable buildings for those who demanded that religious education should be sectarian. But it also established a National Board of Education with a grant of \u00a325,000 to found a system of elementary schools wherein the religious instruction was to be unsectarian. The National Board spent \u00a314,000 of this sum in erecting the Model School at the head of Spring-street. It was to accommodate 200 boys, 200 girls, and 150 infants, and provided apartments for 50 trainees. This was by far the finest educational establishment the colony had yet seen ; and application was made to the Irish National School Board to send out a head-master and a head-mistress well acquainted with the unsectarian system of Ireland. In 1853 Mr. and Mrs. Davitt arrived to occupy the head positions in the new institution. The National Board, with its balance of \u00a311,000, built thirteen smaller schools in various parts of the colony ; it also conducted eight schools in tents on the goldfields, an average attendance of forty being gathered under each of these frail roofs to carry on their studies amid the turmoil of cradles, windlasses, and whims. The two systems worked together in a somewhat costly rivalry, the denominational schools receiving \u00a333,000 of public money in 1853, and \u00a360,000 in 1854, while in 1857 their grant had risen to \u00a384,000, which, with fees, made a total of \u00a3130,000 spent in the education of less than a third of the children of the colony, these being mainly the children of towns wherein education was, as a matter of course, much less costly than elsewhere. But the State had now at least some guarantee for the efficiency of the work done, as its inspectors annually examined all those schools which received grants from Government. The first inspector so employed was H. C. E. Childers, who, having landed in Melbourne in 1850, a young graduate fresh from college, soon found occupation under the State in this manner. After inspecting for a year, he was promoted to be Auditor-General with a seat in the Cabinet, and in his place Mr. Campbell, the first Presbyterian schoolmaster of the colony, was appointed to be inspector of the denominational schools. The system of having two boards was not found to work well. They grew jealous of one another, and not only were they antagonistic, but they entered into a ruinous rivalry. The reduplication of small schools proved cumbersome, while there could be no doubt that they were, on the whole, ill-disciplined, and inefficient ; besides all this, they certainly did not contain one-half of the children who ought to have been at school. In 1861 the denominational system possessed 484 schools, educating 37,500 children ; and the national had 187, educating 14,000. If we add the pupils of private schools, only 56,000 children out of 122,000 were being taught, and that mostly in a slip-shod fashion. Some improvement was clearly necessary. The first effort at amendment was made by Michie in 1856. He proposed to combine the two systems and bring all the schools more directly under the authority of the State ; but his effort was abortive, the influence of the denominations being too strong for him. In 1858, however, when the relations between the two boards were notoriously unfriendly, the public became more inclined to act in the matter. The Denominational Board, in its report, gave an annual growl at the National, alleging that it received 30 per cent, of the State support and educated only 20 per cent, of the pupils, and distinctly charged it with the fabrication of untruthful financial statements. The National Board was ready enough with its retort. In 1858 Michie again moved his former proposition, which was seconded by McCulloch. Both of these, in their speeches, declared that the educational systems of Victoria were unmistakable failures ; and the Assembly seemed to think so too, for the second reading of"], [546, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 524 the new bill was carried by thirty-three to eleven ; but this raised the powerful indignation of the churches, and no less than forty-seven petitions poured in to entreat Parliament not to take the control of education out of the hands of the religious bodies. All denominations joined in this crusade, but the Catholics provided about half of the petitions. Warned by the uproar which they heard around them, the members of the Assembly \u2014 who in a month or two would have to face their constituents in a general election \u2014 let the matter drop as quietly and as expeditiously as possible, forgetting that they had passed the bill at its second reading by a heavy majority. But its alarm was found to be groundless, for in 1860 the fact became clear that the democracy was destined to rule in Victoria, and the democracy was inclined to adopt a very independent position with regard to the clergy. It began to be very well understood at that time that the churches could affect the results of political elections much less than formerly ; and that the workingman, who was anxious to have his children properly educated, and who was by no means satisfied with the denominational schools, was very apt to turn a deaf ear to any pastor who lectured him on the manner in which his vote should be recorded. The Assembly rapidly became much less afraid of the influence of the churches, and on 22nd May 1862 the democratic champion, Heales, introduced what was called the \" Common Schools Act,\" as a distinctly democratic measure. It abolished the former boards, appointed in their place a single one of five members, no two of whom were ever to be of the same denomination. All schools in the colony which wished to receive Government aid were bound to place themselves under the general control of that board, even though they might be still connected with their various churches. Provisions were made to prevent a multiplicity of small schools ; and, according to these, fifty-five of the smaller institutions would be at once closed. All the common schools \u2014 as they were now to be called \u2014 were to give four hours of consecutive teaching in secular subjects ; they could teach religion as they pleased, but no child was to be compelled to stay to receive it, and none was to be refused admittance because of any religious test. The bill was passed by a majority of thirty-eight to eighteen on the third reading, and the Council agreed to it without a division. The new board took charge of the education of the colony in September 1862. It commenced with vigour, and introduced the system of \"payment by results,\" according to which if a teacher received two-thirds of his salary at a fixed rate, the other third would not necessarily be given in full, but would be paid only in proportion to the results attained by his pupils at the annual examination. But after five years of existence, the new common school system was not found to be any great improvement, beyond the saving of some \u00a320,000 a-year to the State ; and in 1867 a commission was appointed to inquire into the whole question of the elementary education of the colony. It reported that still only about half of the children were being educated. Nothing but a strongly-constituted central department could provide for the maintenance of schools in thinly-populated districts where they were badly wanted. Away in the wilds were children growing up in absolute ignorance, because the cost of supporting a teacher for each handful of pupils was too severe to be borne by the struggling settlers. The churches appropriated none of their own funds to that purpose, so there was no way of meeting the difficulty but by arranging that the State should assume a general control and provide for all districts as efficient a system as a due economy of public funds would permit, balancing the costliness of the small country schools against the comparative cheapness of the larger ones in towns."], [547, "EDUCATION AND SCIENCE IN VICTORIA. 525 The commission took a great amount of evidence, which showed that after all, even in the denominational schools, not a very great deal of religious instruction was given, except by the Roman Catholics. It reported that in the case of all the Protestant denominations such lessons in religion as were given were mostly unsectarian, and that there was therefore no reason why the Protestant churches, at least, should not agree as to a common system of lessons to be taught, if the State took into its own hands the complete control of education on an unsectarian system. Much evidence was also taken as to the advisability of making education compulsory in the colony. Opinions were almost evenly balanced, and the commission refrained from making any recommendation. It expressed its conviction, however, that the teachers were too numerous, and their qualifications much too slender, and it advised the State to exact five hours' secular instruction each day, instead of four as formerly. In accordance with the report of this commission, Higinbotham, on the 7th of Ma)- 1867, brought in a bill to provide for one consolidated system of schools ; but the religious difficulty was an insuperable obstacle. The clergy clung to the management of education, and after a period of agitation the bill was withdrawn. And yet it was generally hoped that after the lapse of a few years the hostility of the churches among themselves would abate sufficiently to permit of their framing some scheme of unsectarian religious teaching so as to enable the State to found a national system, which would nevertheless be free from the accusation of being without religion. Five years were allowed to pass after the disappearance of Higinbotham's bill before the matter was again taken up ; and in the meantime the country had had an opportunity of expressing its opinion. A general election took place in 1S71, and the Ministry \u2014 McCulloch, Michie, Francis, Wrixon, and Mackay \u2014 had all set forth for the first time, as part of their programme, a national system that was to be free, compulsory, and secular. There were, of course, opponents to the idea of free education ; there were opponents to the idea of compulsory education ; but the fight raged around the question as to whether it was to be purely secular. The people, however, were of opinion that if the churches were likely to agree among themselves they would have done so ere then ; if they were not likely so to agree there seemed no reason why the educational system of the colony should remain far in the rear of that of other countries during the indefinite duration of sectarian hostility. The constituencies therefore gave a most decided utterance, returning a a majority of two to one pledged to support the views of McCulloch. September 1872 a bill was brought in by one whose name is always affectionately remembered in the colony in connection with the establish ment of its first truly efficient system of national education. That was James Wilberforce Stephen, grandson of the originator of the anti-slavery movement and son of that George Stephen who brought it to a successful issue. But almost immedi- atcly after the meeting of Parliament, McCulloch's Go vernment gave place to that of Gavan Duffy, who, during his year of office, had enough to do to keep his position without entering on an at tempt at difficult legislation When he in his turn gave way to the Cabinet of J. G. Francis, the matter was again taken in hand, and on 12th In a fine speech at the introduction of the bill he re ferred to the land legislation JAMES WILBERFORCE STE"], [548, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 526 os the colony as having sent the people out into the remotest parts of the country, and he asserted that it was the duty of the State to see that they were provided with schools for the rising generation who were to make the citizens of the future. The State should compel every parent to see that his child was educated to a reasonable extent; and if education was to be compulsory, then it must in fairness be made free; not that there was any charity in such a system, for when a man paid his taxes, if the education of his children were provided for out of the revenue so raised, it was only a case of co-operation carried to its widest extent. The schools, he feared, must be uniformly secular. He would have preferred that religious instruction should be provided for ; he was himself a member, and he hoped a real and hearty member of the Church of England, and he had in youth been brought up to the strictest and most exclusive ideas. But since he had come to the colony he had learnt that the peculiar advantages of his own church were not so great as he had imagined, and that the difference between sect and sect was not so serious as to cause all the bitter ness and dissension which -unfortunately existed among them. His experience in the colony had taught him the lesson of tolerance now that he was grown to be a man, but he would like to see the little folks learn that same lesson of kindness when young. He would like to see the boys and girls of all denominations sitting side by side upon the same school forms, and acquiring in their early days a feeling that they were the children of the same Motherland, and the tender charges of the same affectionate Father whose infinite graciousness embraced them all. He would have been glad if the churches could have united and lent their assistance to a national scheme, but as they would not cheerfully agree to that process of intermingling, it would unfortunately be necessary to ignore them. The State must simply do without their assistance, and after providing that all its children should receive that purely secular education which is necessary to make them intelligent citizens, it must leave to the churches and to parents the duty of providing religious instruction elsewhere than in school, unless clergymen chose to make use of the school-rooms after school hours. This was a sweeping change, and the churches loudly protested. Meetings of clergymen were held, but as they could secure no unity of action, the Assembly grew more confident of their powerlessness to affect the issue. Fellows and James MacBain made a strono* effort to throw the measure out, but by forty-two votes to twenty-one it was carried, and on bein<* sent up to the Council it was adopted by that body also by eighteen votes to eio-ht. This new scheme enacted that though anyone was at liberty to open a school who pleased to do so, yet the State would give no assistance to any ; but would provide for every district of the colony a school to which, in default of any other education, every child over the a\"*e of six years should be compelled to go until he had either passed a suitable examination or had reached the age of fifteen years. This great system of schools was to be under the control of a Minister of Education, to which position Stephen was himself appointed on the 2nd January 1873. The new Education Department took over directly the 453 schools that already belonged to the State, having been built partly under the National Board and partly as common schools. It entered into negotiations for the purchase of 590 school-rooms at that time belonging to the denominations. Many of these were acquired, but the State also began the construction of new schools in districts as yet unsupplied, and such was the activity displayed that in a few months forty-three new schools were at work. During the years 1874, 1875, and 1876 the department increased its schools by an average of 170 each year. But the increase of schools was no criterion of the activity displayed, for it was one chief object of the State to abolish a crowd of small"], [549, "EDUCATION AND SCIENCE IN VICTORIA. 5-7 schools, which jostled against each other in in efficient rivalry, and to replace them by larger schools in the populousdistricts, while schools of a smaller kind were reserved for places that were thinly inhabited. But the com- pulsory clauses made a sudden and auspicious change in the number of pupils. In 1872 there were only 66,000 children in aver age attendance, or, including pri vate schools, there were perhaps 75,000 children under instruction \u2014 not more than half the number who were in the colony. In 1873 the attendance had increased by 50 per cent, in the schools supported by the State, and that in spite of the fact that the Catholics, who refused to take advantage of a system which they de nounced as godless, were now educating so many in private schools as to in crease the number so in structed to no less than 24,000, making the total under instruction about 125,000, or about five sixths of those who were of school age. One immense ad vantage of the new system was that the efficiency of I. SCOTCH COLLEGE. Z. ST. PATRICK'S COLLEGE, j. WESLEY COLLEGE. 3 P Vol. I"], [550, "528 VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. the teachers was much more certain. Strict examinations by a central department took the place of appointments made through the influence of clerical dignitaries ; salaries were improved ; the staff of inspectors increased in numbers and efficiency. In short, from that time to this the community has continued to feel an ever-increasing pride and affection for the national system of education established by the bill of Wilberforce Stephen. The department has had the services of singularly tasteful architects, who have replaced most of the former dingy-looking buildings with structures that are a constant pleasure to the eye, and which form one of the most prominent ornaments of the country. They have been built with a complete freedom from monotony of design, and even the smallest and cheapest that dot the more solitary places are neat and pretty, and act as architectural models, by which the people of the district cannot fail to profit. On a lonely road the traveller will come upon a neat little building ; it is a school-room, with the schoolmaster's dwelling attached, with every surrounding smart and orderly. Not a house is in sight ; nothing is to be seen but miles of forest. And yet there are pupils back among the ranges, or out upon the side roads, or in bush houses not far away though invisible. And when the morning bell begins to ring they appear from north and south, from east and west, to acquire the blessings of education which no one but the State could have brought to their doors in these sparsely-populated districts. One half of the children are educated in these small schools, which only the State could afford to support. Thus through times of agitation success was reached with regard to primary education, though the churches made several strenuous efforts in later days to overturn the system. But in regard to education of a more complex character the progress made was much less mingled with strife and discussion. The first matriculation examination of the University was held on the 13th April 1855. There were sixteen candidates; they met in the Exhibition-building, there being as yet little but the foundations of the University above the ground. The professors had arrived only a very short time before, but the Chancellor was resolved to set the teaching operations in motion at once, and lectures were begun in various rooms borrowed for the purpose. They did not require to be large, as the students were very few in number ; but the professors, in spite of that fact, began with a high ideal, and unflinchingly rejected such of their small flock as did not reach the standard demanded by the British Universities. But at length, on Commencement Day, in April 1858, Mr. Chancellor Barry had the proud triumph of admitting to the degree of Bachelor of Arts the first five students who had completed their three years' course. Their names were T. C. Cole, J. Macfarland, Wr. Finn, G. H. Greene, and R. Thynne. The increase in numbers was slow. In 1860 there were still only thirty-six students, but there were zealous workers who were resolved to give themselves no rest till the University was placed in a position of dignity. There was first of all the Chancellor, Redmond Barry, to whom the cause of the University was as the staff of life in these its early years ; and then there was the Vice-Chancellor, Dr. A. C. Brownless, whose best energies were then, and have been ever since, devoted to its interests. And in future years, when it has become great with a long roll of illustrious names, it may well look back with grateful regards to Barry and to Brownless as the practical founders of its prosperity. It was they who piloted many a useful measure through the Victorian Parliament ; it was they who secured the Royal Letters Patent, issued 14th March 1859, by which the degrees of the Melbourne University were recognised as of equal rank with those of \" any University in the United Kingdom\" ; and to them we owe the foundation of the various schools of the institution. At first the University contained but the one school, and trained its students in only the"], [551, "EDUCATION AND SCIENCE IN VICTORIA. 529 one course, that of Arts. But it was clear that in a young country the professional courses would be much more wanted than one which was purely scholastic. In 1860, after no little agitation, arrangements were made for a course of law, leading up to the degree of Bachelor of Laws, and a school of Civil Engineering was also provided, with James Griffith as the lecturer on technical branches. But the foundation of a Medical School was a work of much more urgent necessity. Barry and Brownless set to work to induce the Legislature to grant the necessary funds, but their efforts were for a time unsuccessful. After two years of agitation a commencement was made in 1862, when additional funds were granted, and the Council of the University was enabled to request Professors Owen and Paget to select for them the most prominent anatomist whom a thousand a-year would tempt to leave England and fill the chair of Anatomy, Physiology, and Pathology in Melbourne. They selected George Britton Halford, who arrived in December 1862, bringing with him a supply of necessary apparatus and \u00a3500 worth of medical books, which the Council had directed him to purchase in London as the nucleus of a medical library. The lectures of the Medical School commenced on 1st May 1863, but they were only a poor beginning in out-of-the-way corners, for there was no room for new classes, and it was not till the close of the year that the Legislature voted \u00a36000 for the building of a separate Medical School, with lecture theatres, dissecting-rooms, and laboratories. But at length, towards the end of 1864, the school was properly organised, with Dr. Macadam as lecturer on Chemistry, Dr. Tracy for Obstetrics, Dr. Barker for Surgery, Dr. Fades for Materia Medica, and Dr. Robertson for the Theory and Practice of Medicine. And so, with its four courses of Arts and Laws, and Medicine and Engineering, the Melbourne University was set on a prosperous footing. Professor Wilson, a little man of fiery temper, but devoted zeal, toiled with successive generations of students through the various grades of mathematics, and threw all the energy of his impetuous nature into the equipment of a first-rate collection of physical apparatus, wherewith he conducted with care and singular success the delicate experiments necessary for lectures on light and electricity and magnetism. Professor Hearn, in genial fashion, gathered a crowd of the coming men of the colony round his chair, and with many a joke and many an unexpected sally stirred them up to the enjoyment of a student life without their being conscious of the process. Professor M'Coy displayed his yards upon yards of elaborately-tinted diagrams, and his shells from the dawn of time, and bones from vanished creatures ; while, tier above tier, the students scribbled into their note-books the slowly deliberate words of one whom they knew to be very nearly the most eminent of living pal\u00e6ontologists. In another class-room, Professor Irving held forth to ever-increasing classes, as to the dignified beauty, the massive grandeur, the sublime repose, or the fervid passion of the dramas that once had been blended with the daily life of Athens. In those times the University was ruled solely by a council of twenty members, but in the statute of incorporation there was a provision that so soon as the number of graduates reached a total of a hundred they should form a legislative body, to be called the Senate. On 14th June 1867 a Gazette notice announced that the requisite number had been attained, and the Senate held its first meeting on the 2nd of July, when it elected Dr. Bromby to be its first Warden His culture, and that old-world courtesy which the finest minds derive from English academic life, had made him a singularly influential headmaster of the Grammar School. Its pupils had acquired a life-long devotion for their scholarly teacher, who, though indulgent beyond the extent that was sometimes altogether good for them, had yet that lovable nature which, when combined with elevated personal character and distinguished attainments, converts the teacher into one who"], [552, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. leads his pupils as the Oriental shepherds are said to lead their flocks-in front of them, with attractions, rather than in the fashion of the drover who sets his dogs after them from behind. What a number of the prominent men of the colony look back to the class-rooms of the fine old building upon the St. Kilda-road as the. pleasant and profitable starting point of successful careers ! . The Presbyterians were, however, the first to respond to that desire for collegiate institutions, generally felt by the community and publicly expressed by the Select Committee of i8u. They founded, in 1854, what they called the Melbourne Academy, but in 1857, when they received a grant of land upon the Eastern Hill, and a contribution of \u00a36500 from the State towards their building fund, they converted it into a finer institution, called the Scotch College, for which, in the course of a year or so, they obtained from Scotland a new head -master, Alexander Morrison, through whose skill and energy, and re markable business capacity, the institution rapidly sprang into the position of being for many years the largest and most pros perous college of Australia. The Geelong Grammar School, with a grant of \u00a37000 for its building fund, was founded in 1856, under its generous-tempered head-master, J. B. Wilson, who mingled classic culture with a devotion to natural history, and a special weakness for sponges and polyzoa. Its picturesque quadrangle overlooking the Barwon became the largest boarding school of Australia. It was not till 1865 that the Wesleyans took the field, when a grant of a fine block of land on the St. Kilda-road, and \u00a32750 for a building fund, assisted them in the erection of their Wesley College, which, under Dr. Corrigan, became a thriving school, but reached much palmier days when, after his death, it passed under the control of Professor Irving and Professor H. M. Andrew. The Catholics, with a grant of land near St. Patrick's Cathedral, and \u00a310,000 in money, built their well-known St. Patrick's College, which at first provided for both day-boys and for boarders ; but in 1872 they removed the latter to a palatial building they erected in Kew, and which they entitled St. Francis Xavier's. With all these fine institutions, to which were added the Geelong Scotch College and the Ballarat College, Victoria was well supplied for the secondary education of boys, but the education of girls was left in the haphazard condition of older times. About 1870 there came a period of agitation, when some innovating folks propounded the discovery that girls had minds to be cultivated, and that to them the value of an intellectual training might be as great as it was to boys. Out of this movement there arose, in 1874, the fine institution that lifts its brown walls in front of the Fitzroy Gardens. It was called the Presbyterian Ladies' College, and its first head-master was the scholarly and cultivated historian, Charles Henry Pearson, whose manner of resigning a year or two later has been already narrated. The progress of female education in the colony was enormously stimulated in 1880, when the University, after much agitation, removed the prohibition which confined its lecture-rooms to men. One of the earliest effects of this measure was the foundation, in 1883, of a Wesleyan institution at Hawthorn,"], [553, "EDUCATION AND SCIENCE IN VICTORIA. 531 where, on the most elaborate, and indeed luxurious scale, the future matrons of the colony can taste, as well as their brothers, the pleasures and benefits of collegiate life. In 1870 there was a notable addition made to the resources of the University by the foundation of the first of its affiliated colleges, named Trinity College. It rose only in small instalments, but piece after piece was added, till at length, after an expenditure of \u00a330,000, the English Church have reared an edifice wherein they may not only train their future clergymen in their theological studies, but may also provide for the general body of the students the advantages of those social influences which are so much valued at Oxford and Cambridge. The Presby terians did not follow this example till 1879, when, by the munificence of Francis Ormond, who gave \u00a333,000 for the purpose, the remark ably handsome building called Ormond College was erected at a cost of about \u00a365,000. Its stately front and one of its wings have been com pleted for several years, but by the further con tributions of the public-spirited donor, the whole of its magnificent quadrangle is approaching com pletion. In recent times the Weslcyans have also raised their affiliated college, to which they have given the name of Queen's College. And now the University is an elaborate pile of buildings, with museums, laboratories, and professors' resi dences rising round it in its spacious grounds ; and behind it, the three handsome colleges assist in suggesting how great is the provision for the higher culture of the colon)-, and what a gulf divides our times from the condition of only a generation ago, when, on the site of all these stately edifices, the bullock drivers used to camp in 1852, among mud-tracks and scrub and gum trees. A very noteworthy series of institutions is now springing up in the chief towns of the colony in the shape of Schools of Mines. The first was opened at Ballarat in 1870 with an inaugural address by its first president, Sir Redmond Barry. From a small beginning this institution has grown to be prac tically a local university, with classes of a mainly scientific character, conducted chiefly in the evening, for the training of young men for industrial callings on a scientific basis. A similar carries on the same excellent work for a crowd of intelligent youths, from among whom not only Victoria, but also the other colonies derive their mining man agers and experts. Melbourne possessed no such establishment for technical instruction till 1885, when the generosity of Francis Ormond contributed the fine building of the Working Men's College to the cause of tech nical education in Victoria. THE HON FRANCIS ORMOND. institution in Sandhurst now"], [554, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 532 THE MELBOURNE OBSERVATORV. SCIENCE. There was nothing scientific attempted in the colony until the era of gold excitement. Then came Selwyn, as Government geologist, chosen by Sir Roderick Murchison at the request of Latrobe. The remarkably fine geological maps which he made of the goldfields district formed the first genuinely scientific work of Victoria, although Bass had made a slight attempt to describe the animals of the colony, and Strzelecki had made a flying inspection of the geology of Gippsland. From 1852 onwards, however, the bent of the colony grew more and more decidedly scientific, although even now it cannot be said that original research is by any means characteristic of it as a community. The first science in which famous work was done was botany. The botany of Australia, as a whole, had been to a certain extent described before 1850. Sir Joseph Banks and Dr. Solander had made a beginning in Captain Cook's voyage, but far more complete was the work of that leader among botanists, Robert Brown, who accompanied Flinders in the Investigator. His collection of 4000 species, and his famous work on the plants of New Holland, revealed to the scientific world a new and instructive realm of botany. But Flinders had scarcely landed in any part of Victoria, and, in spite of the fine work done by Allan Cunningham, the botany of the lands that lay behind the southern coasts was as yet unknown ; and so it practically remained till the arrival of Ferdinand von Mueller in 1852. He had been a successful student of botany in Germany, though educated for medicine, and when he came to South Australia in 1847 for the benefit of his health, the natural bent of his disposition led him to devote his energies to the description and classification of the wide, the interesting, yet mostly unknown botany of these colonies. After five years of research in South Australia, he was appointed to the position of Government botanist of Victoria, and for three years he rambled in every part of the colony. He was, as Labilliere remarks, the"], [555, "EDUCATION AND SCIENCE IN VICTORIA. 533 last explorer of Victoria; since his time, though small patches even now remain to be traversed, the country has been practically mapped out. That a delicate man, who came to the colony by reason of bad health, should have forced his way out from Gippsland through the glorious jungle of the Dividing Ranges, that he should have been the first to ascend Mount Wellington, that he should have been the first to discover, to ascend, and to name Mount Hotham and Mount Latrobe, is a surprising instance of the power which the spirit may have of triumphing over the body. Range after range he traversed, not only adding to our geography, but filling his collecting albums with specimens of plants never before seen or heard of. It was a hard life, but one made happy by the successful results of scientific zeal. He revelled in the \" magnificent display of fern trees\" rising to thirty, fifty, or even seventy feet high ; he sought out among their moist and mossy retreats the hundred species and more of lovely ferns ; he measured with wonder the stately white gums and blackbuts, which rival in their height the loftiest spires of the grandest cathedrals the world contains; and he penetrated to the lonely sources where rivers spring to life under the might)' beech forests. In 1856 he joined as botanist the expedition of A. C. Gregory, which was landed on the shores of Cambridge Gulf, and which, after exploring the course of the Victoria River, forced its way by a laborious journey to the settled districts of Queensland. DARON FERDINAND VON MUELLER K.C.M.G., M. & PH.D., F.R.S. In this toilsome expedition Mueller added to science no less than 500 species of plants before unknown. On his return to Melbourne he was appointed director of the Botanic Gardens, which till that time had been managed by a committee, of which Sir Redmond Barry was chairman. But abstract science claimed Dr. Mueller's main attention. His \" Fragmenta Phytographiae,\" and his \" Plants of Victoria,\" and his voluminons contributions to scientific literature, have placed him in the very front rank of botanists; indeed it is not probable that he has any living rival in the department of classificatory botany. After the publication of his great work \" Flora Australiensis,\" which was the labour of seventeen years, and involved the examination of a hundred thousand specimens, the well-earned honours fell thick upon him ; the King of Wurtemberg made him a Baron, the Queen made him a K.C.M.G., and still higher, to a scientific mind, he was made a Fellow of the Royal Society of London. To Baron von Mueller practically belongs all the credit of botanical work in Victoria, although Dr. Ralph, and in later years Mr. Guilfoyle, have accomplished work that is both useful and interesting. To an almost equal degree the science of zoology in the colony gathers round the name of Frederick M'Coy. Soon after his arrival in 1854 he began to agitate for the foundation of a National Museum, and on his own account commenced the formation of one, for which room was found in a part of the University buildings. But as the students increased in numbers, and the stuffed birds and animals, the stones and fossils, likewise grew numerous, the same building could not contain them all, and M'Coy, after the exercise of much tact and patience, had the satisfaction of seeing the Government erect, at the rear of the University, a small but conveniently arranged building to form the National Museum. To this institution he has devoted the best energies of a life-time. It has been the child of his affection, and if in a"], [556, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 534 century hence it should grow to be a magnificent national establishment, it should be recognised as a monument of the zeal and ability of that naturalist who, though sure of the highest honours in England, elected to cast in his lot with the colony, and who has already given it thirty-four years of arduous service. But while watching and tending the growth of this fine collection, superintending the stuffing, the mounting, the labelling, and classifying of thousands upon thousands of specimens, he has had time to devote himself to the publication of scores of papers and memoirs which have helped to reflect a certain scientific credit upon the colony, and which have secured for their author the envied letters, F.R.S., after his name. His great work on the fauna of Victoria, a publication with elaborate descriptions and charmingly executed plates in colour, has been in progress for a quarter of a century, and will leave but little for future gleaners in the field of Victorian zoology and pal\u00e6ontology. In early times there were other workers in this field ; Ludvvig Becker might have been a second M'Coy, but after only two or three years of labour he joined the expedition of Burke and Wills as naturalist, and perished in the desert beyond Menindie, a martyr to the science he loved. In the special department of polyzoa, Dr. M'Gillivray, of Sandhurst, has made himself, by long and zealous re searches,the great authority upon that class of animals in so far as regards Australia; but with a worthy second in his friend and ally, J. B. Wilson, of the Grammar-school, in Geelong. In the early years there was in existence a small and feeble Zoological Society. There were two or three active scientific workers in it, but most of the members were without biological training. Out of this latter class, however, of men interested in natural history, though not specially proficient in it, there sprang a practical society of a very interesting character, which was called the Acclimatisation Society. Its object was^to introduce into the A FIELD NATURALISTS' EXCURSION. country such animals as would be likely- to prove useful to it, either for food, for transport, or for industrial pursuits. The most active promoter of this society was Edward Wilson, of the Argus, who devoted himself ardently to the introduction of the salmon into Victorian rivers ; and who, though he had to leave the colony in 1859, spared no effort and no money in England to secure the shipment of ova under suitable conditions. In spite, however, of elaborate and costly experiments, Victoria has not yet become the home of the salmon, though greater success has attended similar attempts in regard to the trout. Under the zealous efforts of the society, and especially of its chairman, Dr. Thomas Black, and of its active secretary, A. A. C. Le Souef|"], [557, "EDUCATION AND SCIENCE IN VICTORIA. 535 the alpaca, the llama, the camel, the angora goat, the ostrich, together with deer and game of many sorts, have been introduced with more or less success. But the most notable result of the society's exertions has been the formation of the Zoological Gardens in the Royal Park, where a collection of 1500 living animals, all housed in most picturesque dwellings in the midst of a charming park, forms one of the most remarkable features of so juvenile a nation. All the scientific fervour round the dangerous route by Cape Horn, a little error might be a dangerous thing. Hence, when Hobson's Bay became thronged with shipping, it occurred to Latrobe that a small observatory would be a most useful institution wherein absolutely accurate astronomical time could be discovered, and to which the chronometers of ships could be sent for regula tion, so that in their long and perilous voyage back to Europe their captains would at any rate feel tolerably secure as to their longitude. of the colony dated from the period of the gold excitement, and it was then that Victoria first thought of establishing an observatory. The move ment had a double origin. The first was Latrobe's desire to make Melbourne a safe port for shipping. A vessel that arrived from England in those days, after a three months' voyage, was not likely to have its chronometers showing per fectly accurate time ; and if it had then to start on its three months' voyage homeward, R. L. J. ELLERY, F.R.S. There happened to be in Victoria at the time Robert L. J. Ellery, who, though trained for the medical profession, had been by taste and amateur work, an astronomer of some few years' standing, though only seven-and-twenty years of age. To him, in 1853, was entrusted the task of organising a small place of the kind at Williamstown, close to the shipping, and conveniently situated for ships' captains. Here he laboured in the interests of navigation for two or three years, but in 1856, when the Government resolved upon a complete geodetic survey of the colony, this little observatory became of importance as the starting point of the process, and during two years, preliminary observations were there carried on. In 185S Mr. Ellery was transferred for five years to the Survey department, and, along with the Surveyor-General, Mr. Ligar, superintended the extensive operations of that important work. Meantime another observatory had been organised for magnetic and meteorological. observation. It was established at first on behalf of the King of Bavaria, by George Neumayer, who is now the Nautical Astronomer at Hamburg. In 1S50 a movement for the magnetic survey of the globe had been in active operation. It had begun as early as 1834, and Major-General Sabine had directed extensive operations which led to the mapping out of a large part of the world. The King of Bavaria had entered with great enthusiasm into these interesting investigations, and not only caused his own dominions to be surveyed, but, seeing that Australia was still a perfect blank upon the map, sent out \u25a0 Neumayer to carry on the necessary observations. Neumayer \u2014 who had been chosen for the purpose on the advice of Humboldt \u2014 arrived in 1S57, and applied to the Government for a piece of ground in the Botanic Gardens reserve. It was refused him ; but a second application for the use of a part of the Flagstaff Gardens was acceded to, and there he erected, at the expense of the King of Bavaria, a central house for the long and careful observation of the values of the magnetic vol. 1 3 y"], [558, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 536 elements, which were to be determined by hourly records continued night and day for four or five years. The site was eminently suited for meteorological observations, and the Colonial Government having been stirred up to take an interest in his work, supplied him with a moderately good set of instruments, including a transit instrument, electrometers, a photometer, an anemometer, and a sufficient supply of barometers, thermometers, and so forth, which were duly placed in position in detached buildings. At length, the special mission he had been sent out for being completed by six years of unremitting and self-denying labour on the part of himself and two assistants, he prepared for his return to Germany, but first took part in an agitation for the formation of a permanent Government observatory, duly equipped at all points. Already for several years this agitation had been in progress with increasing vigor. It had been begun and carried on by a strong .scientific society that was now in existence, for in 1854 the presence of so many scientific men as the colony then contained suggested the formation of some such association. Unfortunately, the idea was conceived at the same time by two different sets, who at first refused to coalesce. On the one hand the efforts of W. Sydney Gibbons, a chemist and popular lecturer, were successful in establishing the \" Victorian Institute for the Advancement of Science,\" of which Sir Redmond Barry was the first president. He delivered his inaugural address in September 1854, at the Mechanics' Institute. On the other hand the Philosophical Society of Victoria was founded in the same year, with Captain Andrew Clarke, the Surveyor-General, as its president, and as its vice-president Dr. Godfrey Howitt, who was an enthusiastic entomologist. On its council there were Dr. Mueller, A. C. Selwyn, Dr. Eades, Dr. Iffla, and Mr. Blandowski. But there was no field for two such societies, and next year they were wise enough to unite, under the title of the Philosophic Institute, with Captain Clarke for president, Sir Redmond Barry and Dr. Howitt for vice-presidents. It had been announced in the prospectus of the Philosophical Society that it proposed to apply for a charter of incorporation, after which it would assume the title of the Royal Society of Victoria ; a consummation which was reached in 1860. In 1858 the Government granted the society half-an-acre of land fronting the Carlton Gardens, whereon it raised a hall for its meetings, and for the accommodation of its ever increasing library. In those early days there was much activity in the society. Dr. Bleasdale, with his jewels and precious stones ; C. W. Ligar, with his geodetic papers ; Dr. Mueller, with laborious botan ical descriptions ; Professor Wilson, with mathematical and actuarial contributions ; Julian Tenison Woods, with geological work ; Edward Wilson, with acclimatisation papers ; A. K. Smith, with suggestions in engineering ; Professor M'Coy, with his fossil bones ; Macadam, with chemistry ; Ellery, with astronomy and military science; Becker, Blandowski, Ralph, and others indicated the wonderful scientific awakening which seven years had brought about ; and Sir Henry Barkly, who was president for the four years ending 1863, was a geologist of sufficient attainments to give a most intelligent support and encouragement to the prosecu tion of science in general, and of his favourite study in par ticular. PROFESSOR W. C. KERNOT, President of the Royal Society."], [559, "EDUCATION AND SCIENCE IN VICTORIA. 537 It was out of the exertions of this society that the observatory sprang. A committee was appointed in 1857 to urge on the Government the necessity of sounding a first-rate observatory, as a combination of that superintended by Ellery and that founded by Neumayer. It was proposed to follow up in Melbourne the great work carried on, but not concluded, by the laborious years of Sir John Herschel at the Cape of Good Hope. For that purpose the society urged Parliament to grant funds for the purchase of a large reflecting telescope. The committee recommended the Royal Park as the most suitable site, but the Government chose instead that situation first chosen by Neumayer upon the St. Kilda-road. Accordingly in 1863, there rose an observatory inferior to only a very few of the great observatories of the world, and excelling them all in one feature, the possession of the largest telescope ever constructed until that time, for which the Legislature granted the sum of \u00a310,000. To the directorship of this fine establishment, Mr. Ellery, who was now the secretary of the Royal Society, was appointed. His astronomical work at Williamstown had been not only all that had been expected from a nautical point of view, but had been quite surprising in its more distinctly scientific aspects. By a series of observations on Mars, carried out in conjunction with Mr. Stone of the Greenwich Observatory, Mr. Ellery had assisted in deducing the correct distance between the earth and the sun. It had until then been estimated at ninety-five millions of miles, but these observations showed it to be only ninety-one and a-half millions, a distance that agreed with the experimental results obtained by Foucault, when measuring the velocity of light, and which has subsequently been fully justified by the more decisive but less frequently occurring transits of Venus. There for a quarter of a century Mr. Ellery has laboured, with telescopes and transit instruments; with chronographs, and electrometers, and anemometers, converting his establishment into an efficient and important unit in the phalanx of workers that now encircles the world, earning for himself various scientific honours, and among others the Fellowship of the Royal Society of London. During the last quarter of a century his second in command has been E. J. White, F.R.A.S., to whom has fallen the important and toilsome work of computation ; and who, as vice-president of the Royal Society, has otherwise rendered scientific service to the colony. In this observatory there has been executed a series of photographs of the sun, to which the scientific world attaches especial value, owing to the combined advantages of a clear atmosphere and so large a telescope. For nearly twenty years the presidential chair of the Royal Society was filled by Mr. Ellery, whose general conversance with all departments of scientific work constituted him an exceptionally useful guide in the quiet and unostentatious researches carried out in different directions by a society too small to have sectional meetings of specialists, yet with a whole new continent of research lying before it in every department of science. In 1886 Mr. Ellery resigned the position he had so long held, and the society elected to its chair the professor of engineering at the University, W. C. Kernot, M.A., who had for many years previously been a frequent contributor to the transactions of the society, which now extend to twenty-four volumes. But besides this central society, Melbourne has long possessed smaller associations of specialists. The Microscopical Society was founded in 1873, and held many an interesting meeting when the brethren of the lens mounted their polished instruments, and compared their objectives, and showed each to the other the wonders he had secured in pond, or rock, or garden. It published for a long time its own transactions, but in 1886 amalgamated with the Royal Society, of which it now forms a section."], [560, "538 VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. The Victorian Society of Engineers, though comparatively young, has done good work in keeping its members abreast of the times in the theory and practice of their profession, The Geographical Society, kept in healthy vitality by the exertions of its secretary, A. C. Macdonald, has equipped several expeditions, notably one for the exploration of New Guinea. But perhaps the most interesting of the younger associations is that of the Prield Naturalists, whose main delight it is to go abroad in company, to visit such districts as are likely to yield a harvest to the devotees of the hammer, of the net, or of the dredge ; to the collector of plants or the sticker of insects. Their most notable ramble was that in which they were landed from a steamer on King's Island, and overhauled that isolated region to carry back their various trophies of fauna, or flora, or mineralogy. The monthly evening meeting of these Field Naturalists is full of interest ; each is so zealous about his own department, and all contribute so largely to the store of exhibits that crowd the tables. From these amateur enthusiasts there ought to spring the material for excellent research in future years.

Where they grow and spread there must be a fringe which ever pushes outward, and in which the poorer dwellings lie scattered in ungainly fashion. This fringe in some directions may be formed of the charming mansions of the wealthy dotted out and out into the surrounding country, but it is not in the direction of wharves and railway termini that the wealthy build their secluded retreats.

Let us start with our guest and commence at the eastern end of Collins-street, from those broad stone steps over which the Treasury raises its massy front of ruddy tinted freestone. The view from THE TREASURY BUILDINGS. the summit of that flight of steps is one of impressive dignity. The wide street, its wood-paved roadway and its broad side-paths, with the handsome dwellings on either side, forms a vista that is broken by the softly-tinted shades of English trees in their spring attire, that hint of the leafy forest being deliciously mingled with the solid grey of man's handiwork on either side.

There is no great traffic in this part of the street, and the neat little trams that glide with a swan like motion have a spacious roadway almost to themselves. In this corner \u2014 the city, yet outside the city bustle, \u2014 the wealthy squatters have located their club. It is a handsome building, of no architectural pretension, but yet, in the massive simplicity of its freestone walls, suggesting a plain, unvarnished potency of some sort, which is in keeping with the folks who frequent it. For none but men of means can well afford to be free of its halls and staircases and banqueting-rooms. It is most colonially select, and it would be a startling total to taken their way, personified lead betwixt their sentinel town. To think of these of a dozen courses, the iced ments of French cookery; slab huts, the damper, the fat mutton, and the milkless tea to which these same portly gentlemen did honour, with good open-air appetites, when young fellows, strong, eager, and light-hearted!

As we follow the street, we begin to be aware of a hollow before us, whence rise the sounds and the bustle of Babylon. Let us stop and watch it as it first bursts full into view. We gaze beyond those churches which stand in our frontispiece, but there 1 E. G. FITZGIBCON, TOWN CLERK OF MELBOURNE.

Between the elm trees that rustle on either side of the street we look down on a noble avenue, with lofty buildings on either hand ; those broad footpaths are dark with moving crowds of busy passers : between these the smooth roadway of wooden blocks is blackened by a maze of vehicles through which the tram cars have to find their way with caution, and the interminable sound of their bells rises ever in quick, sharp warning from out the dull growl of wheels and the shuffle of many hundreds of feet. Beyond the hollow, the street rises in easy slope, still thronged, still enclosed by lofty buildings, and as we look over its bald brow we see still liner rows of still loftier buildings rising on the other side from unseen foundations, till we lose them in the dimness and the dust of distance. Vol. I. i R"], [566, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 544 VIEW IN COLLINS STREET, MELBOURNE"], [567, "THE METROPOLIS. 545 Let us descend into the noisy heart of the city. To our right we pass the handsome building of the Independent Church and the still statelier Scots' Church. This is an ecclesiastical and journalistic quarter : for two more churches here raise their freestone fronts, that of the Baptists to our right being a plain but dignified facade of Grecian architecture. But on the other side the Daily Telegraph office lifts its plain but spacious walls some five stories in height. Next it, very humbly housed, the Argus has its home, the primitive exterior giving no suggestion of the wealth of appliances and resources within. When the foot of the hill is reached, we look north and south along the busy Swanston-street, a broad thoroughfare of handsome shops running indefinitely up the hill, while downward it carries the eye across the river on the spacious roadway of the Prince's-bridge. This corner of Collins and Swanston streets is dignified by buildings of fine architectural effect. To the south the great pile of the Victoria Buildings rises in row after row of offices, while on the north the rich, yet by no means florid fronts of the Town Hall spring from their bluestone foundation, and with many a pillar and ornamented window support their vaulted roots and the clock-embellished tower. Let us pay a visit to the realms within, where we may prevail on the genius that there presides to show us this civic centre of the city. E. G. Fitzgibbon has been so long the town clerk, that he and the city of Melbourne are bracketed together as a matter of course, and we must gather with care the words of wisdom with which he enriches our course through suites of offices devoted to the transaction of municipal business ; through the finely furnished hall wherein the town councillors and aldermen are wont to watch the mayor's eye as he sits in state, when they wish to descant on the affairs of the city ; through the handsome apartments devoted to the use of his worship, and so to the noble Town Hall, that lofty chamber that has witnessed so many triumphs of the musician's art. It is seated for an audience of two thousand persons, but with its capacious gallery for chorus, rising behind the platform, and its abundant floor-space, it often provides room for half as many more. Its elegant balconies ; its rich but tasteful decorations rising far over-head to a vast ceiling unsupported by pillar or bracket ; its magnificent organ, that shows its giant pipes in a great gold-embellished row, all assist in giving an impressive effect to this handsome room. Here the city organist, David Lee, for many years past has gathered an audience every Thursday afternoon and every Saturday evening to hear the grand roll of the splendid organ as it gives voice to classic overture, or stirring march, or strains that are dear to popular affections. Farewell to the courteous Fitzgibbon and once more upon the crowded streets. As we hold westward, dodging and veering now this way, now that, to avoid the throng upon the footpaths, we have handsome shops to our right, and rows of offices to our left, but in the long lines of windows there are two wealthy banks to break with their pillars the uniformity. Among the building societies, the solicitors' chambers, the architects' offices, and so forth, the Age has its printing and publishing office \u2014 a handsome front of four stories in height. As we cross Elizabeth-street and think of the muddy gully of fifty years ago, the eye is lost in amazement at the magnificent vista of warehouse, bank, and public building that stretches on either hand. Standing at the corner it is possible to count some twenty banks, most of them housed in buildings on which no money has been spared ; nearly all of them in good taste, and with a general stateliness of effect that gives the various views from this point a special charm of their own. And thus on we go, past Queen-street and William-street, the bustle slackening a little ; the banks and shops giving way to the great warehouses of the wholesale merchants. Thus we pass the surprising pile of the Federal Coffee Palace, a magnificent structure, though a trifle ornate for civic architecture. On passing King-street a quieter aspect prevails, and at length Collins-street terminates in a railway station that is little in keeping with all this grandeur \u2014 a great spread of corrugated iron roofs occupying acre after acre with flimsy dinginess. On looking back, the magnificent vista of Collins-street, dipping down in its gentle hollow, is revealed again from a fresh and still more interesting point of view. The eye is delighted with the extent and the liveliness of the scene as it follows the rows of buildings, their domes, and turrets, and spires, growing ever apparently closer to each other, and dimmer and more airy looking till they terminate in the far-off Treasury Buildings, now a mile away."], [568, "546 VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT."], [569, "THE METRO POLLS. 547 In our wanderings, let us turn down the hill to the river. It is only a stone's throw distant, but the scene is utterly different, when we find ourselves in Flinders-street with the sullen stream to our right, and to our left long rows of second-rate shops; those seamen's restaurants and chandlery places, which accompany the neighbourhood of shipping; those busy but not cleanly publichouses, and those pawnbroking places crammed to the very door, which indicate only too well how Jack makes up for the hardships of the sea. Flinders-street is here but half a street; for to our right it is open and fringed with wooden wharves, whence float the smoke of puffing and rattling donkey-engines, and the dust of collier vessels unloading with mighty din. It is pleasant to cross over to the Queen's Wharf and see the giants resting their iron sides after the buffeting of the open ocean. There they lie, steamers of the intercolonial trade in a line of half a-mile in length, and beyond them a goodly forest of the masts of sailing ships from foreign parts. And looking across the flood, whose shining face and restless lines of liquid light conceal the dirtiness that lies below, we see still finer wharves, granite walls, with ponderous cranes, and lines of goods sheds. As we move eastward the buildings grow finer ; we draw aw-ay from the region of wharves, but plunge into a bewildering maze of traffic \u2014 carts and cabs and omnibuses, carriages, lorries, and trams, wherein the stolid driver of a heavy pile of timber threatens ever and anon to work endless wreck and ruin. Here, spaciously situated, the Custom House turns its sombre face out upon the wharves, whence a perfect stream of clerks hurry to and fro, on their errand of passing entries for those piles of merchandise which are being swung up out of the holds of a hundred vessels. To our right we now have a make-shift region \u2014 two temporary bridges, the works going forward for the new ones that are to replace them, and the broken and untidy approaches that lead to them. Then we reach the Flinders-street station, another area of temporary structures, wood or ugly brick with roofs of corrugated iron. The exterior is so little attractive that it may be as well to take our visitor within, and show him the well-appointed railway lines, the signal boxes, the spacious platforms, the constant dashing up of trains that look as if they were bound for a distant station, but check their impetuous speed as if by magic, and disgorge from their scores of opening doors a crowd that for a minute throngs the platforms, then melts, one scarce knows whither. Here is a train about to start. 'I he seats are occupied, the bell rings, the guard whistles, the inevitable late comers pant up to the footboard to be shoved unceremoniously in as the long row of carriages begins its gliding motion ; in another minute its tail-lamp has whisked itself round the curve and is lost to sight, when up rushes another train to pour forth again its hundreds all busy with their own concerns, and eager to be oft' upon them. So runs the progress of the day from five o'clock in the morning until after midnight, train succeeding train with endless bustle. Three hundred trains a day are thus despatched ; three hundred are thus received on that spot where fifty years ago Fawkner's hounds ran down a kangaroo among the shady wattle-tree copses. Passing the barriers, we escape once more to the open street. It is a most exhilarating sight to look back at sunset, as the artist has done, upon this busy Flinders street. For the great crowds that descend Elizabeth-street are people who have finished their day's labours, and the mind follows them to many a suburban home, the cheery meal, the expectant children, the social evening; and exults at the wide ocean of happiness that underlies the turmoil of human lives. And the scene is picturesque. The tram-cars lit with fairy-gliding lights of many colours; the clock tower with its shining face; the wreathing smoke beyond, and the lines of tapering masts against the feeble glow of the western sky, all contribute to the striking effect of a most characteristically metropolitan prospect. Through all its length Flinders-street is still in effect a one-sided street. Though the warehouses and hotels are high and imposing on one side, we have on the other only the fences of the station area, and when, after a five minutes' walk, we are beyond the stations altogether, to the right there opens out a prospect of park lands, the Flinders Park stretching in grassy slopes with dotted trees down to the windings of the scarcely visible river, its boats and its boatsheds. Across the river there is a wide extent of landscape,"], [570, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 548 FLINDERS-STREET AND RAILWAY STATION. which the eye takes in with pleasure, ranging over the clustering tree-tops upwards to the Government House upon the height ; large, but a trifle ungainly, with a high tower whereon the flag of England floats. But more to the east the prospect is much more distant, and the view is carried over the bosky glades of the Botanical Gardens, out into the scattered villas of South Yarra or the terraces of Jolimont and Richmond. Flinders-street to our left has some handsome buildings, chief among them the rising magnificence of the great Anglican Cathedral of St. Paul's and the Grecian portico of the Australian Church. On reaching the foot of Spring-street we are at the end of Melbourne proper. Beyond, we should descend to Jolimont. Let us rather turn up Spring-street, having to our right the beautiful hollow of the Treasury Gardens, with its paths, its statues, and its rustling trees. Facing this park, and indeed within it, stands the enormous range of the Public Offices, a huge but cheaply-built structure dominated by the Royal Coat of Arms in cement. It is not a building of architectural magnificence, but the comfort and convenience of the mazes of offices it contains \u2014 those of education, of lands, and so forth- -have perhaps been all the less sacrificed on that account. Here, too, stand the extensive buildings occupied by the Government Printer and his little army of workmen. Passing up Spring-street, with the Treasury to our right and the doctors' end of Collins-street to our left, we reach the beginning of the Parliamentary Reserve, overlooked by one of those immense coffee palaces which are so marked a feature of Melbourne in its recent development. Whether it is that the incessant difficulty with regard to domestics has driven the desperate householders to abandon their homes and, in American fashion, to take up their abodes in great establishments where the ladies no longer know the cares of housekeeping, or whether it be that the influx of visitors or homeless people to Melbourne has of late been so great, certain it is that vast establishments capable of accommodating from three hundred to five hundred guests, are now rearing their many-windowed fronts in all parts of the city, and thriving with a vigour that could not have been prophesied ten years ago."], [571, "THE METROPOLIS. 549 Passing to our left a most imposing specimen of this class of architecture, we reach on our right what promises to be the stateliest building of Melbourne \u2014 the House of Parliament \u2014 still slowly unfolding the magnificent design proposed in the days of Latrobe. A spacious flight of steps, extending the whole width of the facade, and bounded on either hand by elaborate wings, leads up to a row of ten lofty columns, on which a magnificent entablature runs along the whole front of the building surmounted by statues. Over all, there will eventually rise a great cupola, springing from clusters of pillars. The eastern front has long been finished ; the western or main front is now approaching to completion ; the other fronts are to be pushed forward rapidly, and ere long the Legislature of Victoria will be as magnificently housed as any in the world. Though the exterior is still only in progress, a great deal of the interior is complete, and a stroll through its spacious halls will be somewhat of a surprise. First there is the elaborate vestibule with its costly HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT. floor of rich mosaic and its walls and ceiling of graceful and harmonious design, pillar and cornice and carving all combining to make a most magnificent portal. Then there are the many suites of spacious offices \u2022 the rooms devoted to the use of the members ; the handsomely furnished and appointed library with its 40,000 volumes ; but, centres of all, the chambers wherein are wont to meet the legislators themselves. They are both of them rooms that strike the eye with a grateful feeling of agreeable proportions, and the subdued richness of the decorations casts a pleasant spell over our senses as we stand here in the visitors' gallery and look down upon the scene of so many byegone conflicts. Here in the hall of the Legislative Assembly those benches, now empty, have been tenanted by many a Government, watchful of the faces around them, and speculating as to the votes which might or might not cause them lo eitiit the precarious honours, and the dearly-bought profit of those slippery seats. Yonder is the portion occupied by the Opposition,"], [572, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 5 .So and in that angle the \" Corner \" find accommodation \u2014 that neutral faction whose votes are sought for by both sides. If we are not too soon, we might as well wait till the House assembles. The members drop in by twos and threes, hat on head, in earnest confab, or deep in the evening paper. A sprinkling of seats are occupied when the mace appears, followed by the Speaker, Mr. M. H. Davies, in all the gorgeousness of his gold-embroidered robes. He is comparatively new to the office, but his period of rule has so far augured well; a little adroitness and a due admixture of firmness being needed in the occupant of that chair of state if the atmos- phere of the place is to be kept free ot thunderclouds, whose breaking means tu- mult and turmoil. The chances are, however, that we see only a very formal routine, the occasions when fire is struck out by the rubbing ot parties being com- paratively not nu merous. At times, however, these Go vernment gentlemen, LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY CHAMBER. 110W SO Callll aild composed, are loud in anger, throwing defiance to the noisy Opposition, who return them scorn for scorn. It is only in some such scene that we have an opportunity of discerning the talent 01 members for eloquent declamation or ready retort. We probably have to miss all that excitement, and take our way to the chamber of the Legislative Council, to see an equally unruffled transaction of business. There, upon their softly-cushioned benches, sit a score of our territorial magnates or our wealthiest merchants, and in the chair of state sits Sir James MacBain ; long used to Parliament and its ways\u2014 a veteran on friendly terms with all his fellow-members, and therefore maintaining decorum chiefly by the charm of personal influence LEGISLATIVE council chamber. Descending to the street once more we are conscious that this corner of Bourke and Sprint streets is a most favourable situation for an effective view. Looking to the north, we have to our left the\u00b0bold and attractive architecture of the Princess Theatre, which faces the green foliage of the Parliamentary Gardens Beyond the theatre Spring-street and Nicholson-street meet at an angle, the corner being partly occupied bv an open space, but behind that stand the Mode. Schools, their buildings now looking a trifle ancient"], [573, "THE METROPOLLS. 551 anything over a generation old being quite venerable in this city of constant renovation. Then behind the school, still further to the north, the dome of the great Exhibition Building rises from the umbrageous retreats of the Carlton Gardens. Many accessories assist in giving an air of grandeur to this prospect. But the view down Bourke-street also, though less distin- guished for lofty buildings, is a remarkable vista of life and bustle and activity. The street from where we stand is a mile in length, and throughout most of that distance it is lined on both sides by retail shops. There was a time when Bourke-street was regarded as the principal street of the city. That rank has now undoubtedly returned to Collins-street, which was originally the leading thoroughfare before the gold excitement upset all previous arrangements. Bourke street has practically no dwellings and no churches, a Jewish synagogue in the west being the only exception. But it is the street of theatres and concert halls, and when evening comes it is the metropolitan street, gay and lively, while Collins-street is wrapped in gloom. Yet Bourke-street is a busy street too from the earliest hours in the morning. The shutters of its long arrays of shops are removed, with clatter enough, from the hours of seven to eight in the morning, and then the retail traffic commences that will not close till seven MATTHEW HENRY DAVIES, Speaker of the Legislative Assembly. in the evening, when half the shops, in compliance with the Early Closing Act, will darken their windows and bolt their doors ; the others, exempt, or perhaps defiant, will prolong the toiling day to nine or ten in the evening. As we descend the long but gentle decline that leads down to Elizabeth-street we shall pass on either hand every description of shop. But photographers, and jewellers, and restaurant-keepers at first predominate ; then the clothing trades are in the majority till we reach the theatre quarter, when cafes, confectionery shops, tobacco nists, and all that class of places which minister to the nightly luxuries of the occupants of pit, and stalls, and boxes are almost continuous for a block. Standing here and looking back, we have to our left the Theatre Royal, with minor places of amusement clustering round it, and beyond it the handsome front of this; Melbourne Coffee Palace \u2014 a busy place, and helping to keep the neighbour hood busy. To our right we have the plainer front of the SIR JAMES MACBAIN, President of the Legislative Council. Opera House, and beyond it begins our picture of Bourke-street, with the facade of the Bijou Theatre to the right, and rows of shops of three stories each lacing the hill on either side, past Russell-street, and then, with occasional buildings of less elevation on either hand, past Exhibition-street, and so to Spring-street, Vol. I. 3 S"], [574, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 552 If where the I Parliament House. .^j^j^j^j^j^j^j^H up j^i^i^i^i^i^i^i^i^H street animated, the i traffic of vehicles being constant, || and as of .^j^j^j^j^j^j^j^H on their ultimately divergent I outes up this slope, there I ceaseless traffic brightly- f- painted cars to and fro I the centre the j^j^j^j^j^j^j^j^H But Bourke-street I characteristic when night has I fallen, the lamps I and the I scattering pale blue I out roadway and restless I vehicles, and up upon the I of the buildings that elsewhere I are heavily masked with solid I shadows.

Towards eight o'clock the iron gateways draw in from the passing currents the crowds whom managers, and actors, and property men, and musicians are holding themselves ready to amuse within. At intervals throughout the evening the theatres disgorge a large part of the male portion of their audiences, whose evenings no histrionic or operatic genius could render otherwise than oppres sive unless the comfort of alcohol filled up the dreary monotony of a five minutes' entr'acte. The billiard-saloons are numerous, and their flaring gas jets, reflected down upon the green baze of many a table, light up long rows of countenances generally a trifle unhealthy ; for those who spend their evenings habitually at billiards, lounging with cue in hand and with the concomitants of beer, and whisky, and hours of smoking, and with tobacco smoke for breath, are scarcely to be taken for patterns of ruddy health ind good looks. A glance at one or two of these places will probably satisfy our curiosity ; and then the atmosphere even of the crowded street seems like a heavenly waft of freshness.

The frontages to three streets \u2014 Bourke-street, Exhibition-street, and Little Collins-street\u2014 though anly two stories high, have a dignity ol"], [575, "THE METROPOLIS. 553 their own which comes from their great length and the weighty treatment of the same massive elements in long rows. They are broken by dwarf towers, in which occur the gateways, the western of which gives access to the basement floor, while those in the east are able, by reason of the steady rise in the level of the street, to give access to the upper floor; so that the heaviest vehicle rumbling under the archwav can enter and deliver its goods to right or left, roiling upon a solid roadway of asphalt, as if no stores and stalls were occupied beneath. It is a very interesting place to visit, this Eastern Market, especially if it be Saturday night, when the thoroughfares are thronged with a promenading crowd. The careful mother of a straitened household has brought her white face and THE EASTERN MARKET. her curved shoulders out for a breath of air, and with basket on arm she narrowly watches the piles of greengrocery or the crockery ware that rise in huge banks of cheap brilliancy on the gas-lit stalls. The fa' her is there with a boy or two trotting at his heels, and their stay is more prolonged where the tables glitter wiih confcc tionery. But the great mass of the crowd consists of sweethearts, young folks out lor their weekly stroll, and the giggling flirtation of the maidens released from a week of toil in factory or in service, kindles the fire of a clumsy wit in their somewhat noisy admirers ; those youths whom all the art of the suburban tailor, and all the pinching of the zealous bootmaker, cannot disguise. No, nor the barber with his scented hair pomade. A certain twang betrays them, and suggests, even for otherwise worthy folks, the blessings of a little polish ; the advantage of a little of that delicate aroma which refinement gives to social intercourse. But the crowd is uniformly good-humoured, cheerful, and orderly, and there can be no more suggestive way of spending an hour than in watching it surge past in endless succession of knots of two and three and four\u2014 a perfect ocean of study for the philosopher and student of humanity. But the displays of the stalls themselves are worthy of a little attention; a number of florists make"], [576, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 554 one end like a perfect conservatory with sine pot plants and terraces of flowers ; people with fane- goods spread their toys in bright expanses of colour: here is a vendor of birds and yonder a m n , .ho makes a specialty of dogs; and the cries of animals, the hum of human conversation, the frequent laugh, the report of firearms where small boys are firing into the pit of the stomach of a wooden Russian, the shuffle of countless feet, all make the place a source of mental exhilaration. Overhead a dozen of electric lamps hiss, and splutter, and scatter over all the busy building their rays of moonlight blue. But we have still much of Bourke-street to see, and out we must sally again ; among this Saturday-night crowd there is little use in trying to hurry ; we must be content to flow with the stream, past all the brilliancy of the shop windows and the tempting brightness of the publichouse bars. Here is a place one almost instinctively turns into. It is a huge book arcade, with books by the ton ; books by the half-mile displayed in long avenues. The pathways are densely thronged; the working folks are laying in their weekly store of mental provender or their next supply of horrifying romance. A piano and some stringed instruments make merry up stairs in the galleries of second hand books, also crowded by busily-examining throngs ; it is a remarkable exhibition ; a place sui generis, belonging to Melbourne alone. The northern side ot Bourke-street is dark, for there stand several of the largest drapery establishments which are scrupulously attentive to the Saturday half-holiday. We THE general tost office, Melbourne. must come by daylight to see them, and also this handsome Post-office, now in course of receiving its third story. It is truly a building well worthy of the city of which it forms the business centre. Its plain co'umns of doric form support a massive facade upon granite steps, and within them the broad colonnade, though paved with durable stone, shows the mark of that ceaseless wearing which must have accompanied the tread of so many thousands daily for the last quarter of a century. It is a place of immense resort, for in our days the Post-office is the heart of the social system. The mighty volume of correspondence is, day and night, distributed therefrom to circulate throughout the corporate mass as in our bodies the blood is pumped into the furthest capillaries to carry health and vigour into every part. It is best by daylight also to ascend the hill that leads us to the west end of Bourke-street. At night it is daik, for here no retail shops are found, but tradesmen's places and horse bazaars ; grand warehouses frown in bluestone upon either hand. The Jewish Synagogue and St. Patrick's Hall exhibit fronts of tasteful design, but the vast wool stores are the features of the district. Here at the corner of William-street stands that hotel which enjoys a recognised pre-eminence among the hostelries of Melbourne; its two frontages of plain, but dignified design, capped by little turrets, make a picturesque feature in a noble prospect."], [577, "THE METROPOLIS. 555 To go forward in Bourke-street would be of little service ; the buildings decline in importance and finish where the dingy fence of the Spencer-street Railway Station shows that the roadway terminates. But across its iron ugliness we can look beyond upon a wide prospect, even though it be only the West Melbourne Swamp, the winding Saltwater, and the dirty Yarra. Behind these lies the suburb of Footscray with many a smoky factory chimney ; a* little to the right, and far behind them all, rises the pale blue curve of Mount Macedon. Having looked a minute or two at this prospect, let us turn our gaze up and down this cross street named by Bourke after the Sailor King. Looking downwards, William-street is, for a quarter of a-mile, as handsome a thoroughfare as any. High warehouses, suites of offices with ornate fronts, lead the eye with an air of impressive solidity down that slope whereon Henry Batman, fifty years ago, raised, upon the short green sward, his hut of \u25a0 bark from all the surrounding THE LAW COURTS, WILLIAM STREET. gum trees. Here to the left stands the Australian Club ; another domain of the wealthy squatters. With its four stories surmounted by a fifth of dormer windows, all in massy freestone, it is a notable feature in the civic architecture, and from the basement floor beneath them the savoury odours which rise out of the iron-railed area give a faint adumbration of the luxury that reigns within. The view down the hill terminates among the shipping, and the cold glitter of the river. We have already passed along these streets. Let us rather turn northward and view this handsome building from whose boldly-projecting cupola there floats a flag to crown this western hill of the city. These are the Law Courts ; a wonderful structure for a city of half a-century. All in white freestone, with rows upon rows of pillars, and arches, broken into clusters, adorned with statues, THE AUSTRALIAN CUB. and dignified by the central cupola. It covers some three acres of ground, but the visitor who traverses its Ion\"- corridors, its numerous courts, and all the wilderness of rooms and offices required for the due administration of the law, will scarcely believe that it covers so little. And indeed the upper story nearly doubles the actual space of floor ; at any rate the weary feet of the sightseer who has gone over the place with faithful exhaustiveness would seem to witness to many miles of passages, stairs, and galleries. A little way up William-street stands the Mint, a handsome block, enclosed in a high iron fence, looking stately enough, yet with three tall chimneys suggestive of manufactures. If we are duly armed with"], [578, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 556 an order, which will induce the policeman at the gate to let us pass, a pleasant hour may be spent among furnaces and crucibles, and rolling mills, and dies, and scales, watching the operations by which that gold so lab >riously tunnelled from its dark recesses in Ballarat and Bendigo becomes the sovereign so familiar, yet to none of us too familiar. Here to our left commence the Flagstaff Gardens, and if we went to the head of William-street we should see the old cemetery, where the bones of so many pioneers have lain these thirty or forty years. But let us rather turn to the east again up this fine street called after our first ruler, Captain Lonsdale. On our left we soon pass the Titles' Office, an orna mental building surrounded by unorna mental rows of iron-shuttered stores for the safe keeping of deeds ; but these will eventually be concealed from sight by additional buildings ihat ate rapidly going forward. Lonsdale-street, though not distinguished by lofty buildings, has here a handsome air ; a little dimi nishing as we descend the slope and pass into the tradesmen's portion about Elizabeth-street. Beyond Swanston-street we have to our left the ten-acre block reserved for the Melbourne Hospital. The front of it is still a green spot in the heart of the city, fresh with sward and leafy trees, but behind these what a cluster gathers of those dark-red buildings, all gables and angles. Ward after ward in that vast assemblage is occupied by silent sufferers. The big rooms, with well waxed floor, and bare, but cleanly walls, show each a row of white beds to the right and another to the left, and each bed from under neath its snowy counterpane shows a head. On these long rows of faces how many life- THE MELBOURNE HOSPITAL histories are written, many of them now rapidly nearing their end; and those white aproned nurses that bustle about with kindly cheerfulness ; or those stalwart wardsmen, that minister night and day must see a mighty tide roll through these rooms of human misery, and pain, and misfortune. Out in the open air however, it is less depressing. Here in the breezy quadrangles we see the convalescents, whose wounds are healing after the ordeal of the surgeon's knife; or whose emaciated features are beginning to gather a little flesh after that critical struggle which the clinical folks up there have lately waged with death, gamin. perhaps but the barest of victories. Out here they are renewing again the joys of hving-for the air is balmy in .his bright spring morning, and the budding trees are pleasant to look on, and the ceaseless"], [579, "THE METRO POLLS. 557 twitter of sparrows in their branches and up on the eaves must be a perfect dream to those who have been long a-bed, counting the same cracks in the wall, and recording the monotonous hours as they sounded from the Post Office tower. Now they are happy out in the open air, with nothing in the world to do but gather an appetite for the next meal. Beyond the Hospital rises the Public Library \u2014 a treasure house of interest ; beyond that again we can see the charming front of the Hibernian Hall; an ornate, but yet massive treatment of pure white freestone. Behind that again we can see the College of Pharmacy, while more to the right, in Latrobe-street, the Working Men's College raises its unfinished walls, near its smaller but completer neighbour, the Foresters' Hall. Behind them all, on the very brow of the hill, stand the black walls, grim and gloomy, of the Melbourne Gaol. We can see its long rows of little windows, iron barred, and can imagine the inmates, the wretched ones of the city, who sleep behind those windows, each on his mat and covered by his blue blanket on the naked floors of the horrid little cells. Passing the Wesley Church, whose tapering spire rises from out a densely-peopled neighbourhood, we traverse a portion of Lonsdale-street that is unpleasant, the houses and shops of good exterior being mingled with others that are suggestive, if not of squalor, at least of vice. This region is soon left behind ; and we are again in Spring-street beside the Model Schools, and with the dome of the Exhibition once more full in view to the north. It will make an interesting trip to turn half a block south and enter the long thoroughfare called Little Bourke-street ; with the Princess Theatre on our left and the great pile of the Gordon Lodging-houses on our right. A little further on in this narrow street we reach the distinctively Chinese quarter of the city. The shops are dingy, and every few yards a right-of-way gives access to a region of poor-looking buildings wherein the Tartar aliens swarm. Here is a building of peculiar front ; it is marked with Chinese letters in gold ; if we are not afraid, let us enter. It is the Club House, and the largest room is a sleeping place for the poor and destitute, who take turn about, eight hours a-piece, in the bunks that rise in several tiers. The place is close and filled with a sickly perfume. It is the scent of opium-smoking. Let us penetrate into the rooms behind and see the process. There, squatted on a broad square couch raised a foot or eighteen inches from the ground, sits the man in occupation. He looks at us with lustrous eyes from out the hollowest of orbits. He is turning a piece of opium stuck upon a long pin, so as to partly melt it in the flame of a small lamp. When he has rolled it into a compact lump he sets it on fire and quickly thrusts it into the little hole which makes the bowl of his pipe. Then a few rapid puffs and it is over. He composes himself to sleep, and with those fingers, garnished by long tapering nails, he folds his rags around him, and after a fatuous smile or two passes into the world of dreams. Into a world of dreams, but of dreams that have a terrible awaking ; when, with the fierce and masterful fever consuming his bones, he will linger out the horrible hours until another dose is possible. As we wander through bare and dirty rooms, and out upon the porch behind the building, we are depressed by the general sense of uncleanliness and squalor. Let us hasten out by this side entrance into a ri<*ht-of-way. The smell of roast pork comes from several Chinese eating-houses. Here is a Chinese drug store with mysterious preparations on all sides ; dried lizards and shrivelled up snakes. There are at intervals Chinese warehouses of a superior character, where we might wander through orderly and well-filled rooms richly scented with ornamental merchandise, where sallow-faced clerks in neat jlouses and carefully plaited pig-tails, conduct business in a quiet and courteous manner. But the Chinese in Melbourne are mostly of the poorer sort. They spend the day in hawking through the suburbs, and they crowd into these narrow lanes after dark to gamble and smoke opium. Let us open this door and see them in their evening sports. Take care, for it is quite dark, and the rickety wooden stairs that creak beneath us as we ascend have more than one broken place. We grope along a passage and through a store-room filled, as it seems, with lumber; through a crack in the door comes a streak of light, and the smell that pervades the vicinity shows that the mysteries of sucking-pig roasting are going on within. But let us rather make for yonder distant glimmer. There, in a room scarcely bearable for fetid breaths, a silent crowd is gathered round the gaming table, whereat sit two men clad in blue blouses and solemnly pushing and pulling"], [580, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLLS: PAST AND PRESENT. 558 heaps of coin with a sort of rake, now this way and now that, as the fortunes of the game happen to go. The crowd, four or five deep, put forward their skinny hands, from time to time, and pass their coins to be staked, but with rarely a word spoken ; they watch with stolid looks while the ceremonial of the gaming takes place, then you hear a sound as of deeper breathing all round, and the cash is promptly pushed to this side and that, and is silently gathered up. It is hard for the outsider to appreciate the interest of this melancholy business, but there they linger all through the evening hours, and far on into the night, beneath the flaring gas or the flickering oil lamp. There are much more miserable sights to be seen, however, in these places. Here, when you open the door, you see two or three European girls with a sullen look upon their faces. They live with the Chinese, and drink the deepest dregs of degradation. Here is one whose eyes and wasted cheeks proclaim her an opium-smoker. She confesses that she has the fever of it in her bones, and with a piercing look of unutterable and hopeless misery she points to where a younger and fresher looking companion is preparing to smoke, with the hungry eyes of a dozen ill-favoured Tartars boding no good to the hapless creature when her time of stupor is come. / It is a hateful scene ; a brutal existence. Yet an intelligent policeman could take us to a score\u2014 nay, several scores \u2014 of such places within half-a-mile of where we are. But it must never be forgotten that these are the lower stratum of the Chinese. If we wish to see the better classes\u2014 the merchants and their clerks, the shopkeepers and the mechanics \u2014 we might come down here again on the third Sunday of the month. Little Bourke street is then in a lively condition ; some twenty or thirty cabs are waiting to be loaded with Chinamen; each takes its complement of eight or ten ; the horses start with much clatter on the stony f street, and off they go, in a long proces sion for the cemetery. There, in their ovens and altars, the Chinese will honour their forefathers by burning gilt paper, and roasting young pigs, and letting oft crackers. An hour or two later we shall see them return, their round, smooth faces beaming with jollity after the due performance of these solemn rites. These Chinese are a class of men . in every way superior to the others I i whom we saw in their midnight dens, and their good humour and light-hearted ways are interesting to the observer Sights and experiences of many a hundred different sorts might well claim our attention in this central city; this dense congregation of business, bustle, and enterprise; this teeming area of schemin, brains and active hands It covers half a square mile, and in that space how much there is to see not only of the triumphs of art and science, of commercial ingenuity and manufacturing skill, but also of"], [581, "THE METROPOLIS. 559 the ways of men and the humours of their social life. But this central block must not detain us too long, for all around us lie great suburbs, occupying one hundred times as great an area; these will claim at least a flying visit that we may see their prin cipal streets and buildings. First let us take a peep at those suburbs which lie to the south of the Yarra ; those suburbs to which the citizens of Melbourne most commonly betake themselves w-hen the business of the day is done. Of course they are mainly residential areas, and there must be a certain monotony in seeing mile upon mile of mansion, villa, cottage ; of terrace, crescent, and square \u2014 the dwellings of so great a concourse of people. Our first trip to the furthest corner of Brighton will extend to twenty miles before we return once more to the streets of Melbourne. We shall therefore be all the happier if behind a pair of smartly trotting horses and esconced in an easy- A. THE HOM\u0152OPATHIC HOSPITAL. 11. \"THE ALFRED HOSPITAL rolling vehicle. So let us, in handsome style, dash down the broad avenue of Swanston-street and over that sine structure which figures in our headpiece \u2014 the Princes-bridge. Those three great spans of girders resting on their massive piers of solid masonry; those substantial approaches and stone embankments do to our narrow stream all the honour it could aspire to if it were a Thames or a Seine. Vol. II. 3 T"], [582, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 560 Over this bridge we come upon the St. Kilda-road ; rather dreary just at first, with a marshy bit of park to the left, and a wilderness of smoky factories for our only prospect to the right; but after a few hundred yards the road assumes a finer aspect, being lined with public buildings, each detached, and most of them enclosed in spacious grounds. Some indeed will not easily be seen, so thick are their arboreal surroundings. The first, however, is as yet bare of verdure, being too new to possess the charm of well grown gardens. It is the Hom\u0153opathic Hospital, of red brick, faced in a tasteful way with white at the windows and corners. On our left stands the Governor's domain, with a smart little lodge just inside the great iron gates. A well-kept drive leads up to the gloomy carriage porches, where many a fair dame and civic dignitary alight from their carriages when vice-regal festivities are afoot. We might well wish that the St. Kilda-road itself were a trifle better kept. Spacious dwellings and fine public buildings are very well in their way, but we can scarcely look at them contentedly when this uneven road is jolting us up and banging us down again every second or two upon the seats of our vehicle. Verily an archangel would lose patience if you asked him to view fine buildings with such concomitants. Many passengers sigh for the times when tolls were charged, and the roads kept properly in repair. To many a colonist our sketch of the toll-bar of byegone times, though it may recall the memory of vanished sixpences, will yet at any rate remind him that -these useful coins kept the highway in splendid order \u2014 a condition of things that now seems a golden past. On our right, as we jolt along with the mud flying from the wheels, we notice the Observatory, but only the tip of its cupola can be seen for the trees, and the Grammar-school is equally sheltered by a leafy screen. After passing its picturesque tower, we have parks on either hand \u2014 to our left the Fawkner Park of South Yarra, to our right, behind a fringe of mansions that faces the road, there stretches the breezy extent of Albert Park, green and level expanse lying between us and the bay. If it be a fine afternoon we shall see its lagoon bright with the shining sails of yachts that bend their masts to the fresh breeze, and gay with the boats of those oarsmen who prefer the tame delights of a lagoon and shallow water to the excitements of the bay and the risk of drowning. There is a splendid carriage-drive running through the park, but we must keep to the main road and see the buildings that lie on its left-hand side. Here is the Alfred Hospital, a bright and cheerful-looking structure of fancy brick. In this healthful situation, with its pleasant grounds, its elaborate appliances, its handsome wards on the most scientific principles, its large and capable staff of officers, surely never were patients better situated for recovery. But hard by stands a spacious building for those who have no hope of recovery. It is the Asylum for the Blind. A visit to the young folks housed within would be full of interest. Though nothing can be done for their bodily eyes, yet for their mental vision the State has here made munificent provision, and the cheerful inmates are all able to read; their minds are being stored with information which in after years will form a source of constant delight to them; and many of them are musicians of great talent, their want of sight seeming to endow their ears with increased delicacy, and their fingers with increased tenderness of feeling. The next building is the Wesley College, and then comes the Asylum for the Deaf and Dumb prettily situated, and suggestive of the care which civilisation now gives to those who but a century ago were looked upon as outcasts accursed of Heaven. Behind the grounds of these buildings stretches the wide area of the municipality of Prahran, which we shall traverse and examine on our way back. Meantime let us hurry on past half a mile of road lined by pleasant mansions, and so enter the charming suburb of St. Kilda. When we first reach it we are at what is known as \"The Junction,\" where five roads meet. If we go straight on we shall traverse the main street of St. Kilda ; a busy thoroughfare, lined with shops and banks and public buildings, nearly a mile of dust and traffic. But let us rather turn to our right, down Fitzroy-street, towards the sea. We may, however, in passing take a peep at the side streets, and admire the residences; here are cottages that bear ample indication of abundant comfort and culture- 'villas with broad verandahs and neat conservatories; mansions with spacious gardens, and all those delightful surroundings that wealth can procure."], [583, "THE METROPOLIS. 561 A ramble among these streets. so attractive in their air of comfort and repose, brings us out upon the Esplanade. The shores of the bay are here somewhat high, but a grassy slope leads down to a fringe of beach. The edge of the high ground is laid out in a breezy promenade faced by handsome houses and three fine hotels. Here on a summer afternoon the carriages are drawn up in a long line, and the footpaths are crowded with those who come to see and be seen; to gossip and flirt while the pleasant sea breeze brushes away the fever of the hot wind that perhaps is raging further inland. From the sandy beach there stretch some four or five bathing enclosures, whence on a summer morning the incessant splashes and the sound of constant laughter indi cate how much enjoyment the sea affords in so warm a climate. Yonder long wooden pier was intended for the convenience of yachtsmen whose pretty craft lie under its lee, but it is mostly utilised by the promenading ALBERT PARK LAGOON. crowds \u2014 ladies in light and fluttering costume ; gentle men in faultless walking attire, carefully gloved, and accompanied by the inevit able but apparently useless cane. St. Kilda contains much that might well detain us, but we must hurry on, and keep ing round the Esplanade, pass by Carlisle-street, past many a spacious dwelling, till we reach the Brighton-road. And still we are in the region ASYLUM lOK THE BLIND, ST. KILDA B.0A1J."], [584, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 562 of stately mansions, which, for the next five miles, line all the road in long succession, but with increasing allowances of garden and in creasing luxuries of lawns and avenues. To our left lies the wide suburb of Caulfield, three miles long by two miles broad, all occupied by gentlemen's residences. A drive up the Bala clava-road, or the Glen Eira-road, or the Glen Huntly-road, each about two miles long, would give a pleasant impression of the suburban homes of the folks who are so busy by day in the heart of Melbourne ; and we who, from the top of our vehicle, could spy over the hedges and fences would see on either hand, flitting past in quick succession, the lawns, the rosaries, the flower-plots, the conservatories, the shrub beries diversified with statuettes and vases, the summer-houses, the fern-houses, and all that wealth and taste can gather to make a home look seductive. To our right, as we move along the Brighton road, we have the suburb of Elsternwick lying between us and that shimmering dream, which is the Bay in its summer guise. Here too is an area of a mile square, devoted to mansions and villas ; the tower and the campanile of many a stately home rises from the widespread verdure of parks and gardens. And at last, when six miles from the Melbourne Post-office, we enter st. kilda pier. Brighton itself. It is, however, only a succession of the same descriptions of affluent homes ; streets and crescents and country-looking roads are all made use of to the full, land in almost any of them being worth from \u00a35 to a foot. But, as a matter of course, the district most in savour is that which is nearest the sea, and there the mansions of the wealthy cluster in a profusion which will make us feel a pride in showing our visitor the riches of our Mel bourne merchants and the general elegance and good taste of their surroundings. Along that beach which stretches away to the south, what crowds of people swarm on a Sunday afternoon in summer. The trains carry forth the teeming thousands of the city to breathe an hour or two the fresh sea breeze : to kick up the yellow sands and gather such shells as the rippling wavelets may have cast up since the last host came down on the previous Sunday. The worthy old couple, confined all the week to a shop in town, come down for a quiet stroll ; the fond father and mother bring down the coming generation, with supplies of biscuits and sweetmeats to beguile the journey till they get out upon the beach, where they will dig, or wade, or climb. But mostly come the youths of Melbourne, with their sweethearts, and if it is true that \" men were deceivers ever,\" how deep should be the blushes, could they blush, of these tea-tree glades and those rocks and grassy banks, at the oceans of vows and promises they hear as the years whirl past."], [585, "THE METROPOLLS. 563 But now let us turn our horses' heads inland, and spin along the South-road fora mile or two, then bending back towards the city, traverse the eastern parts of Brighton and Caulfield. To our right lies the rapidly-forming suburb of Malvern\u2014 another region of delightfully-situated homes. Then when we cross the Dandenong-road, we are in Armadale, a district thicker in its population, and much more occupied by terraces and uniform rows of villas or cottages. On our left lies the still denser suburb of Windsor. But although the houses are nearer the road, and are surrounded by less spacious gardens, yet the general aspect of the place is open and sunny, there being here no tendency to crowd out the sunshine and the breeze in unbroken walls of brick and mortar. We must now turn to the right again, and, crossing the Malvern-road, enter the aristocraric precincts of Toorak. Here, when Governor Hotham took up his abode in Toorak House, upon the grassy slopes that led down to the tortuous windings of the Yarra hard by, the wealthy squatters who were retiring from the cares of sheep, in those distant days built their residences. Hither, also, came the merchants whom the golden times had rendered wealthy ; and so the district took a fashionable tone, which it still preserves. But, in truth, and apart from such subordinate considerations, it is indeed the most pleasant of all the suburbs. It stands high, with pleasant alternations of hill and hollow ; every hill is crowned by a mansion and its embosoming trees ; every hollow is filled with parks and gardens, and at every rise in the road the most exquisite views are obtained in all directions. It will suit us well to t;ike our visitor up and down those tree-lined roads and side streets, and let him admire for himself what thrift, and energy, and enterprise have been able to bring people to in Victoria. When we leave this pleasant suburb we shall turn down the Toorak-road and enter Prahran. We have, in fact, for a long time been in the municipality of Prahran, but that name properly belongs to the much more crowded suburb into which we now are passing. It is a more plebeian district, and yet with every sign of comfort in the long rows of cottages and terraced houses, each with its little plot of ground in front of it. Chapel-street, which we must certainly turn down and examine, is a busy thoroughfare ; and one of those remarkable suburban main streets which form a peculiar feature of Melbourne. Earge and bustling shops line it on both sides for about a mile, and the tram-cars that glide backwards and forwards are for ever sounding out their warning gongs to clear away the throng of vehicles that occupy the roadway. At one of the corners stands the Prahran Town Hall ; a handsome structure, with a lofty central tower. If we drive back through the thickly-peopled streets of Prahran and cross the Toorak-road again, we are in South Yarra, a district of mostly middle class dwellings. The Toorak-road itself is here for about half-a-mile a business centre, where spacious shops seem evidently to thrive. But the side streets are quiet and pleasant. They have quite an elderly air about them. The trees are so well grown, and the gardens so clearly date back for at least some thirty years, which in Mel bourne means quite a venerable age. It is a very favourite suburb, being only a mile and a-half from the heart of the city, and therefore convenient for the clerks and others who live in lodgings. If it were evening as we traversed the streets of South Yarra we could not but hear the waltz strains of a brass band resounding over the district. It comes from yonder barn-looking building that seems all aglow with light. If we wish to know all the humours of our metropolis we must pay a visit to this, which is one of the eight skating rinks scattered over our various suburbs. PRAHRAN TOWN HALL."], [586, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 564 Let us get a boy to hold our horses, and paying our shilling apiece enter to view the gay scene within. It quite takes the breath away for a moment to see the speed with which the skaters dart past us. We are protected by a stout barrier from erratic or runaway performers, and, here ensconced, we can watch at our ease how they glide round and round; and as the long pro cession skims past us like swallows on the wing, we may admire their varying proficiency and skill. It is a most graceful sight to see a lady, especially if she be young, and light, and well proportioned, moving with easy strokes, her eyes sparkling and her cheeks aglow with the exercise. The roller skates upon the boarded floor make a dull roar, like an everlasting thunder, but the young folks find no difficulty in conversation as they dart along in pairs, many of them hand-in-hand, under the shallow pretence that the lady requires a little steadying; a pretence which their swift and graceful motions, when alone, expose as a most atrocious sham. But it makes the skaters happy to move along in Paul-and-Virginia fashion ; and their sentimental enjoyment, if it amuses us, at least IN THE SKATING RINK. does them no harm The whole scene is one ot the greatest animation; the bright flags disposed around the room, the gay dresses of the ladies, the ceaselessly passing and re-passing, and crossing and re-crossing maze of swiftly-gliding forms, the hum of conversation, the ripple of laughter, the roar of skates, and the cheerful strains of the strenuous band, all conspire to make a most attractive surrounding. No wonder, indeed, that the skating rink has taken such deep hold on the affections of the youth of Melbourne! Suppose we dismiss our vehicle and walk to town. It is not a mile and a-half to the heart of the city, and as our path will lie through parks all the way it will be a delightful change. Turning out of the streets of South Yarra, we pass through a quiet side gate into the Botanic Gardens, whose three hundred acres slope in a picturesque confusion of trees, and lawns, and rustic arbours, and glowing flower beds down to the river, which can here and there be seen in glimpses. At first we are only in the Botanic Gardens Reserve, where to a large extent the natural aspect of the place has been allowed to mingle with the contributions of art. But we soon enter that delightful region of eighty-seven acres which is the Botanic Gardens proper. Here has been lavished all that skill could devise and money could procure to create an exquisite landscape. The ground still slopes, but only gently, and at different parts the eye wanders with satisfaction over the wavy surfaces of four great lawns, each extending to ten or twelve acres, whose smoothly-shaven surface of mingled rye grass and buffalo grass is green as an English meadow. Clumps of shrubs, and clusters of gracefully-scattered trees, divide these lawns from one another, and through their screen we see the flower beds, most elaborately planned not only for beauty, but also to exhibit on a large scale the scientific classification of plants. More than forty of the most important botanical groups are here arranged each in its own compartment, and each presenting on an average some fifty species arranged in their various genera. It is a delightful thing to stand in early spring before the beds that are planted with flowering bulbs, and see the lakes of hyacinths, purple and pink, and blue and white, or of tulips, or of narcissus. More charming still, perhaps, the banks of rhododendron or the beds of azaleas; in one part the magnolia blossoms may intoxicate the senses with their heavy fragrance; in another the heaths, or still more"], [587, "THE METROPOLIS. 565 gorgeously the phloxes, may fascinate the gaze with the exquisiteness of their tints and textures. But above all must we be careful to take our visitor by that winding path which leads through shady retreats of ferns and tree-ferns down towards the lake. This path is nearly a quarter of a-mile in length, and yet it carries us not a third of that way; for the most ingenious devices have been adopted to give to the visitor an impression of having walked through a long and interesting fern-gully, rich with all the charms of nature. They are nature's charms no doubt, but nature did not place them there. Mr. Guilfoyle found a little sunburnt hollow, down which he caused a little artificial stream to flow. Then he planted its banks with hundreds of tree-ferns, and from their stems caused hundreds more of staghorn ferns and epiphytal plants to grow in rich pro fusion. All the year round the damask rose blooms freely in these thickets, and in their various seasons, each after each, a hundred different species of flowers make gay the pros pect and delight the senses with their lus cious odours. Over head a grove of shady trees, exotics of hand some aspect, form a long colonnade of arching foliage, and under these runs the path, now this way, now that, crossing the tiny streamlet some scores of times on rustic bridges, or upon picturesque arrangements of over arching rocks. It is a charming walk, and it will bring us down upon the edge of the lake \u2014 a GLIMPSES IN THE BOTANIC GARDENS. pleasant sheet of water some eight acres in extent, dotted here and there with islets, whose crests of luxuriant foliage nod in gentle movements to their counterparts that shine as verdantly beneath them within the bosom of the waters. \u00b0I7ttle bridges here and there, and spaces decked with floating water-lilies and their delicate tracery of leaves, render the scene as beautiful as art can make it; and the swans that glide with stately ease: the ducks that 'live their perky little lives in exploring all the margin, and dodge in and out among th<"], [588, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 566 vegetation of the islets; the flamingoes that carry their creamy coats as if on stilts over the shallow places, give the landscape that animation which lends it the last of possible charms. It would be pleasant to linger round these little bays and up these grassy slopes, among the four handsome conservatories filled with plants of gorgeous foliage or with resplendent flowers; but we must move onwards and cross the foot-bridge that leads over the river from these delightful gardens into the reserve of the Yarra Park. Here we walk upon the short and springy sward that is native to the country, and over our heads are the scraggy arms of the primeval gum trees. Some two hundred acres are thus left to the people for untrammelled wandering, and in especial to those youthful couples to whom such woodland spaces and a moonlight night transcend all other ecstasies that earth affords. But out of the centre of this pleasant reserve there are carved three circular cricket grounds, of which the most important is that which is figured beneath. The Melbourne Cricket Ground, with its great stands and its well-kept enclosures, is decidedly au ornament to the city. Its spacious lawn of close -cropped turf has witnessed many a notable contest. There, in alternate years, beginning with 1856, the chosen cricketers of New South Wales have met their fellow-devotees of Victoria in intercolonial matches, of which the sister colony THE MELBOURNE CRICKET GROUND. has won s'x, and Victoria eleven. But of all the interesting games that this place has witnessed none has been so memorable as that on New Year's Day of 1862, when the first friendly rivalry in sports took place between the mother country and her growing daughters. What crowds of faces peered one behind another in that vast ring, looking forth on the men whose names were famous in connection with the national game! she greatest enthus.asm prevailed, and, though the local team was defeated, the Melbourne people were proud that their champions had made so respectable a stand against the leading cricketers f the world. But many a similar contest in the subsequent years has caused these stands, these parterres these lawns and these long circles of forms to be filled with dense throngs of people whose oud applause whose cheers and pent-up excitement, have rolled a mile or more from the place where the batsman th bowler, and the scattered fielders were trying their skill against one another In winter this fine ground is given over to football, and when a leading match is being fon\u201ebt out enormous crowds, often exceeding twenty thousand persons, raise cheers and counter cheers thro^h an exciting afternoon, as man after man goes down or is thP hall \\. a \u25a0 , - B f .

If we can take our visitor to some such scene he will carry away a strong impression of the enthusiastic devotion which the youth, and indeed many more than the youth, of Melbourne display in regard to sports of every description. A broad avenue well planted on either side leads us from the cricket ground through the remainder of the Yarra Park and out upon the Wellington-parade. On crossing that broad street we are in another park \u2014 the Fitzroy Gardens, an area of sixty-four acres most exquisitely laid out. Here are no lawns, and only occasional flower-beds. The whole is one dense woodland, and every path is a long avenue, sometimes of oak, sometimes of elm, but always lovely. The trees everywhere meet over head, and no shadier retreat could be imagined. Down the centre runs a fern gully, overhung by lines of willows ; at every turn in the path there are displayed statues and groups of figures, whose white forms some times glow in the chequered sunlight, but sometimes lurk far in the dark ness of some leafy recess. A minia ture temple in the Greek style, and one or two rustic houses, are revealed from time to time to the visitor who roams among these labyrinthine glades. Indeed, a spring morning in the Fitzroy Gardens when these deciduous trees are all clad in their tender- IN THE FITZROY GARDENS. tinted foliage, and kissed into a golden glow by the waken ing sunshine, is a pleasure that calls up in our inmost being those vague, but delicious longings that the sorest creates. But it is much more likely to be far on in the afternoon when we take leave of these sylvan arcades ; the lengthening shadows and a twilight feeling warn us to move eastward into what are called the Treasury Gardens, though in truth but a continuation of the same pleasant domain. Crossing this umbrageous hollow, we are once more in Spring-street, and again within the city bounds. If this long day's ramble has given us a notion of the southern suburbs, we may find it agreeable to spend another similar day in traversing those that lie to the east. Eet us start from the foot of Spring-street, and follow this broad thoroughfare of Wellington-parade which we have already seen. To our left lie the Fitzroy Gardens, to our right the Yarra Park and its cricket grounds. Then passing the large mansion of Sir William Clarke, we have on our left the district of East Melbourne- Powlett-street, then Simpson-street, then Hoddle-street, recalling by their names our early pioneers, all asleep in their narrow beds with the vast city they helped to build circling in ceaseless life around them. This district is one of long lerraces; in the main the houses are of superior class, and the suburb is justified in thinking well of its somewhat aristocratic appearance. In the heart of it, but facing the Fitzroy Gardens, there stands the leafy domain which is known as Bishopscourt, wherein the Bishop of Melbourne has his residence, in a picturesque but old-fashioned mansion. U Vol. I"], [590, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 568 We still have the Yarra Park to our right until we cross the borders of Richmond. This is a densely-populated suburb, no less than 34,000 people being congregated in these two square miles ; not that it is densely occupied in the European sense; for after all there. are but twenty-five persons to the acre, and in those streets that open from right to left the long rows of cottages, both brick and weatherboard, are well provided with yards and little gardens, out of which there rise many and many a score of trees, willows, and pines, and gum trees. This main street, called Bridge-road, is more RICHMOND TOWN HALL, than a mile in length, and is lined on either side with large and busy shops. Here to our left stands the Richmond Town Hall, a building in fancy bricks, and of Italian character, rising into a tower of 130 feet in height. Richmond shares with Collingwood the distinction of being the first formed suburb of Mel bourne. They were both THE ROYAL HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY'S PAVILIO declared separate municipalities in 1855, Richmond having for the chairman of its council the Hon. Henry Miller, and for its town clerk H. G. Cameron. It has steadily grown, and was proclaimed a town in 1872 and a city in 1882; it is now a wealthy and enterprising corporation presided over by his worship the mayor; and its clerk, Mr. Thomas Gardner, has gone through all the gradations of borough clerk and t wn clerk till he now enjoys the highest title of all \u2014 clerk to the great city of Richmond. The Bridge-road leads straight as an arrow to the river banks, which form the confines of Richmond. There a great girder bridge will carry us over to the municipality of Hawthorn. But before we do so it will be well worth our while to turn out of our path a little to visit the Richmond Park, a most delightful reserve of gum tree glades, with the river, and its wi low fringes, winding almost completely round it. Here are situated the gardens of the Horticultural Society. They are forty years old, and are therefore not without those mellower beauties that age can give to a garden. Here stands a vast collection of fruit trees of every kind, and here are gathered choice shrubs and highly-cultivated flowers. But the place is generally quiet, secluded, and rural, except when the annual show is in progress. Then, when the central pavilion is rich with exhibits that show the amazing perfection of form, and colour, and texture to which horticultural zeal can bring our"], [591, "THE METROPOLIS. 569 favourite plants and flowers, the gardens and the hall are thronged with admir ing crowds. After a peep at this pretty place in its sweet seclusion let us return and cross the river. Hawthorn is a wide area; too wide for many practical pur poses, and so subdivisions not known to the authorities are growing up in popular speech. As we follow this main street of Hawthorn, called Burwood road, which runs exactly two miles down the middle of the municipality, we have to our left Lower Hawthorn, and to our right St. James's Park, both filled with pleasant villas and mansions. Then come Glenferrie to our left and Haw- THE METHODIST LADIES* COLLEGE, HAWTHORN. thorn proper to our right, still intersected by quiet suburban streets that are bordered by hedges and garden railings, the houses behind them being almost uniformly surrounded by gardens of luxurious growth, and as a rule of great beauty. The central part of the Burwood-road is a busy district of shops, and there stands the modestly pretty Town Hall of the Hawthorn Borough. Not far away there rises the spire of the Methodist Ladies' College, whose handsome front looks out upon well-kept lawns, and tennis grounds, and flower plots. It is a most attractive place in which to bid the girl blossom fonh into maidenhood amid all the kindly and lovable influences that culture and scholarship can supply. The Burwood-road leads us past many a villa with trim gardens and overhanging hedges to the more distant suburb of Camberwell \u2014 a wide extent of gardens and orchards; the trees, when we overlook them from the brow of one of those little hills over which the road undulates, look like one fine stretch of wood land from which there rise the roofs, the gables, the turrets of a thousand homes embosomed in their verdure. But let us be content with some such distant prospect of this eastern region, and turning our course northward enter the suburb of Kew. It is a wide area, two miles broad by nearly three miles long, all 'devoted to the residences of the well-to-do In one part, where the houses are thickest and the streets most townlike, we may regard ourselves as being in Kew proper, and here we find a busy little main street, with an excellent collection of the quieter suburban sort of shops. The Yarra winds its devious way all along the north of this district, and in one of its bends lies the reseive of the great Metropolitan Lunatic Asylum, whose long rows of windows and square-topped towers are seen afar off on the crest of their wooded hills. . But we shall see this building only from a distance; for keeping along the main street and getting out into that pretty continuation of it called the Bulleen-road we shall hold our way through the outlying suburban area, where live those happy people who can blend the pleasures of the city with all the freshness and quiet of the country. Let us thus cross the Yarra by the long wooden bridge which leads to Heidelberg, and see that pretty suburb, lying in picturesque seclusion in its little hollow; its old-fashioned church, its quaint old inn, its orchards daintily white with blossoming fruit trees, will make a pleasant impression on our visitor. A visit to the Austin Hospital for Incurables should be managed if he does not feel the prospect too depressing of seeing so many sad hearts waiting the hour of doom, expectant of the mortal grasp of that sombre monarch to whom we must all succumb. Yet, as we view from afar the building with its wholesome and cheerful surroundings, we shall doub'less offer our tribute of gratitude to the kind-hearted lady who made it possible for the poor, when mortally stricken, to die out here in brightness and comfort rather than in lanes with no surroundings but squalor and destitution."], [592, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 570 What a pretty road it is \"we follow on our way back to town! It is quite a country highway, carrying us over the Darebin Creek on an old fashioned bridge, and through the village-like suburb of Alphington. But after that the villas begin to grow con- tinuous, and in two miles more, when we cross the Merri Creek, we are again in the city streets. To our right lies Northcote, with some four square miles of villas and scattered dwellings, and behind this again lies Preston, a suburb of gardens and orchards. But we shall hold our course straight onwards upon the Heidelberg road, the city thicken ing around us as we go. The district is known popularly as Clifton Hill. THE AUSTIN HOSPITAL FOR INCURABLES. It is covered with innumerable cottages ot the comfortable working classes; street after street, row after row, of these neat brick buildings, not by any means too large perhaps for the half-dozen romping inmates who probably house within each of them, to say nothing of the fathers and mothers of that shining-faced troop. In the morning at nine o'clock is the time to traverse this district, when the streets seem quite alive with the young folks on their way to school; bag on shoulder in business fashion, or with its protruding slate, swing briskly in the hand of the hurrying schoolgirl. The clang of school-bells, near at hand or faint with distance, is heard over all the district. As we proceed the houses are less uniformly provided with their little gardens in front; there are more houses of two storeys. And still as we proceed we find the population grow denser. We are in Smith-street \u2014 a thoroughfare only second to three or four of the central streets of the city in regard to the magnitude of its traffic. The drapers' shops and the great produce stores, the shoemakers, the clothiers and scores of other trades here make a display that gives to this street a metropolitan air; and on Saturday nights the crowds that throng its gas-lit footpaths are as dense as those in Bourke-street itself On our left lies the suburb of Collingwood, with thirty thousand people --mostly employed in the factories whose bare-looking brick walls and black-muzzled chimneys we see all around. For here is the centre of the bootmaking, the hatmaking, and similar industries. But Collingwood is a wealthy and most enterprising city; it ranks along wiih Richmond as the oldest of the suburbs of Melbourne, and was created a separate municipality at the same date, April 1855, its first mayor being Sir Francis Murphy. It has spent some five and fifty thousand pounds on its drainage alone; and that imposing structure the Collingwood Town Hall, wherein Mr. Mottley manages the civic affairs of the city, is a much more stately edifice than our visitor probably dreamt of seeing in a suburb."], [593, "THE METRO POLLS. 571 To the west of Smith-street lies another suburb called Fitzroy, equally dense, but much less given over to factories. Its streets are mostly two-storied dwellings in constant rows; these are the homes of people engaged in the city, who wish to dwell within easy walking distance from their avocations. Over thirty thousand people are here congregated, and the thoroughfare that runs down the middle of it, the busy Brunswick-street, is a place of immense traffic. When we have threaded the somewhat narrow and closely-built streets of the suburb we pass the great structure of the Exhibition Building, and are once more in the city. These two long trips will have given our visitor an excellent notion of the subur ban areas of Melbourne upon half its circumference. We shall now take him two other excursions to see the re mainder, but lest the mono tony of visiting thirty-one suburbs in close succession should tempt him to rebel, we shall carry him through the remaining half in smarter style. First, suppose we visit the seaport suburbs. COLLINUWOOD TOWN HALL Over the Falls-bridge we enter a region of hammering and din. All the district is covered with works and factories, foundries and forges. Through this noisy Sandridge-road we enter the handsome suburb of South Melbourne, with its broad and busy thorough fare of Clarendon-street. How bright and pleasant seem the cross streets, the homes of ten thousand artizans, who dwell in neat cottages mile after mile in length. In one of these side streets stands the Town Hall, an imposing building pillared and corniced, and friezed in most elaborate fashion, and with a really handsome spire rising from out its centre. It is an edifice as pleasant in its balance and proportion as it is surprising in its extent; who would have expected, in a suburb, and that of only thirty years' existence, a civic palace so comely and stately. Clarendon-street is bright and cheerful. Though banks and warehouses are continuous in parts, yet churches with verdant reserves and mansions with abundant gardens are seen at intervals, giving a most attractive aspect to this principal street of South Melbourne. And it is a fresh and breezy street, leading seawards, SOUTH MELBOU*;**,:' TOWN HALL."], [594, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS- PAST AND PRESENT S72 and with the briny breath of ocean almost always fluttering down its roadway. But between the end of this street and' the seashore lies the great reserve of Albert Park which we have already seen at its other extremity a mile away ; beyond the shining level of its sail-sprinkled lagoon. To the west, the streets ot South Melbourne merge insensibly into those of Port Melbourne, formerly known as Sandridge. This is in some parts by no means so bright and attractive; but it seems impossible that a place should combine a busy, bustling, noisy, prosperous shipping trade with the charms of quiet homes and blossoming gardens. Port Melbourne is fringed by a sandy beach, a trifle soiled by contact with a city and a city's shipping; and from this there run out two long wooden piers which carry their stac-in** a quarter of a mile, as it seems, over restless waters. Along these piers there are moored some scores of vessels, and others are seen anchored off the shore. Here, mingled with ihe brisk sea breezes, are the scents of tar and of odorous cargoes, and by day an everlasting rattle resounds from donkey engines, and blocks, and chains. One of the piers is continuous with the railway system of Yictoria, and on its rails the puffing locomotives, the trucks, some empty, some laden and heaped high, that creep slowly forward' that back and shunt, and creak and jar against each other, add to the turmoil which here reigns while daylight lasts. As a consequence of all this loading and unloading of vessels, the streets of Port Melbourne are given over very much to maritime business, but there are also large manufactures carried on within its boundaries, especially of biscuits and of glass-ware. Suppose we now take one of those little steamers that are plying from the piers and cross the bay to Williamstown. This too is a busy place of shipping. Here at a dozen piers and jetties the great ocean going steamers load and unload. Here takes place the weekly bustle of the despatch of foreign mails; here the leave-taking of friends who are bound for Europe. Williamstown is kept busy by the railway traffic to and from its piers, and also by the fact that within its boundaries lie the great railway workshops, wherein is carried on the repairing required for all the rolling stock of the colony. Hence Williamstown is to quite a perceptible extent an engineering district. Its large woollen mills add to its manufacturing importance."], [595, "THE METRO POLLS. 573 If we take the train to return to Melbourne we shall pass through Footscray, a wide region of factories, and the visitor will perhaps think himself back in the outskirts of Birmingham or of Sheffield, so smoky is the atmosphere, and so constant the succession of chimneys and red brick buildings. But Footscray has also in its outer parts pleasant residential areas that are favoured by the working classes. The train, after running through the somewhat similar suburb of Kensington, lands us upon the Spencer street station, and we are once more in the streets of Melbourne. For our fourth and last trip we must ask our visitor to go with us up Swanston-street, and so into the populous suburb of Carlton. We pass into Made line-street, where the picturesque struc ture of the Women's Hospital first attracts our attention, with its peculiar, but bright and pretty architecture. On the left hand lie the grounds of the Melbourne University, from amid whose abundant foliage the pinnacles of the beautifully-proportioned Wilson Hall lift their flowery tapers over Gothic windows of light and elegant form. It is on the whole the most exquisite piece of architecture that the colony contains, and its interior aspect, when twice a year it is filled with students, trencheied and gowned, at their examinations, is stately and imposing in the extreme. As we round the University Gardens, the Medical School, the Museum, and the three affiliated colleges all come into view, making this the finest block of buildings in the colony, as indeed it ought to be. Let us turn to the west, and reach the Sydney-road, that broadest of all our thoroughfares, lined for a mile and a-half with four rows of trees that are rapidly growing to handsome stature. On every side 01 us lie great parks. To our right the Frinces' Park, with the monuments of the Melbourne Cemetery showing beyond the trees. On our left lies the Royal Park, nearly a square mile of fine open woodland, in the middle of which stand the Zoological Gardens, a place in which the people of Melbourne ought to take much pride. For what city of twice its size, save Amsterdam alone, can exhibit such a collection. Here, under the care of Mr. Le Souef, a place of rare beauty has grown up. The area is a marvel of landscape gardening, and the picturesque cottages, and castles, and rustic houses, and ornamental shelters in which the animals are housed, so far from being a blot, are 'a positive enhancement to the views that are to be had at every hand while traversing the maze of paths. And on a holiday, or a Sunday afternoon, the streams of fond papas and mamas, with children all decked out in their best, who flock through the gates and under the archway entrance, show how much the place is appreciated. Lions, tigers, leopards, bears, wolves, monkeys, and almost all the wonders of the natural history books are here congregated in the midst of sunny glades and well-grown arbours.

Beyond the Royal Park lies Brunswick, with a very busy street in its midst; outside of that street the district is mostly given over to brick-making and other manufactures. As we traverse its chimney-forested area, we reach the boundaries of Co- burg, a subuib that is steadily becoming a favourite for resi- dential purposes, though originally a mere adjunct to the Pentridge Stockade hard by, which has never enjoyed any such growth in po pularity. Now let us take a side road to the left, and after a couple of miles of scattered suburban dwellings enter Es sendon. It is a district free from"], [597, "THE METROPOLLS. 575 manufactures, and wholly occupied with villas and mansions. If we strike its main thoroughfare, the Mount Alexander-road, and turn towards the city again, we shall traverse a truly pleasant district, and so enter the suburb of Moonee Ponds, which is much more closely built upon, though still of a picturesque and agreeable aspect. Passing a handsome and finely-situated Town Hall we enter Ascot Vale, though, as far as we can see, we are still in the same district of comfortable suburban homes. Nor is there any great change visible when we enter Flemington, another of these quiet residential suburbs. Here, however, we must turn out of our way to the right to visit the well-known Flemington Racecourse. It is a wide depression beside the Saltwater River. Its grassy slopes rise all round, making an amphitheatre half a-mile in width. All is still and silent enough at present. It is only a pleasant park with two great stands looking forth upon an almost level \"flat,\" and a racing track well marked with fences and posts. But when the TON KACKCOL'RSE (WITH CAULFIELI) racing meetings are in progress, and especially on that first Tuesday in November, which is universally kept a holiday in Melbourne as \"Cup day,\" what a different scene is presented ! Then how these stands are crowded' How the summer costumes of ten thousand ladies glow in the bright spring weather! How densely that Hill behind is packed when forty thousand faces look forth from it to view the great event of the year' How the spacious lawns and carriage paddocks; how the flat and the surrounding slopes are crowded with promenading holiday-makers! What cheers of victory; what 'groans of defeat have mmgled their sullen roar and rolled up out of this now silent prospect!

This is the most densely-populated district of Melbourne. It is mainly occupied by the houses and cottages of working folks generally neat and comfortable in aspect.

PETER'S CHURCH ON EASTERN HILL IN 185O, CHAPTER XXX. s^^ \u0152be Cbuvcbes of Victoria. ?HE first divine service of the colony was that held on a pleasant Sunday forenoon of April 1836 beneath the sheoaks upon Batman's Hill. The preacher was a Wesleyan, the Rev. Mr. Orton, who came over along with his friend Batman on a trip to see the new settlement. There were only a few white men to occupy the seats on the sward and the carpet of gum-tree leaves and twigs, but Batman's ten Sydney natives were there in the glory of uniform, and a crowd of natives, attracted by curiosity, hung about in the background, listening with surprise, while the worthy Dr. Thomson, acting as precentor, struck up some of the old familiar psalm tunes, and encouraged those around him to add their various contributions to the feeble effect. Mr. Orton took a little tour among the stations that were then being formed, and returned to Tasmania. For a time service was held in simple fashion as on board ship : James Smith, or Captain Lonsdale, or some other volunteer, read the Church of England Service, and two or three hymns were sung on the Sunday forenoon, but nothing permanent could be done till the land was put up for sale and the settlement received the sanction of Government. Even after that for the first month or two the people were much too busy in erecting dwellings for themselves to make any serious effort for the building of churches ; but in the early part of 1838 a small wooden place, with accommodation for eighty persons, was built on the slope of the hill, a little above the Custom-house. At first the service was read as before, by laymen who volunteered for that duty, but in July 1S38 the residents held a meeting and subscribed a sum of money to form a stipend for the first minister.' An application was sent to Sydney, and in response there came the worthy little clergyman, John C. Grylls, a man of no ability, but a kind-hearted friend to all his little flock, who listened with due respect to his prosy discourses. In August of that same year there came from India the Rev. James Clow. He had been a Presbyterian chaplain in the service of the East India Company, but had retired with a pension, and had come to the new settlement with several sons whom he wished to settle on the land. He took up a cattle station at Dandenong, but though he had retired from his religious callincr, and proposed to enter on a country life in order to renovate a constitution sadly impaired by long service in the Indian climate, yet he could not live in the settlement and see the people without a regular service. Arrangements were therefore made for the loan of the Church of England building in the afternoon. This neighbourly accommodation continued for about six 1 BonwicU's \"Discovery and Settlement of Port Phillip,\" p. 134."], [600, "VLCTORLA AND LTS METRO POLLS: PAST AND PRESENT. 578 months, the Anglican worshippers crowding the disreputable-looking little building \u2022 in the forenoon ; while its crazy bell, hung upon a post in William-street, clattered a summons to the Presbyterians at three in the afternoon. But in the meantime the latter body had written to Sydney for\" a clergyman to come and settle among them, and in January 1839 there came our second pastor, the Rev. James Forbes, a man of amiable character and of scholarly acquirements, whom ill-health had driven to Australia, compelling him to resign good prospects in his native land in order to be the pioneer of a great church in a new country. He found a congregation of 250, who had already obtained an allotment of two acres at the corner of Collins-street and Russell-street, and had there almost completed a wooden building as a school-room for the education of their children. That building, costing \u00a388, the humble precursor of the present noble Scots' Church, was occupied by the Rev. Mr. Forbes for his services, and there, to congregations that crowded the little place, his feeble voice, week after week, spoke words of comfort, and recalled their thoughts to higher ideals from the engrossing cares of founding a new nation. The Independent or Congregational denomination had at first joined in the services of the Presbyterians, under Mr. Clow, but in May 1838 there came the Rev. Mr. Waterfield, who had only recently arrived in Tasmania from England, but had heard that there was an opening at Port Phillip. There was no place of worship erected,* but John Gardiner, the holder of the Toorak cattle run, the merchant and subsequently banker of Melbourne, had a weatherboard house in Bourke-street, near the present site of the Royal Arcade. He gave the use of the largest room in it to the little congregation that gathered from across the fields and up from the wattle-scented river's edge on the sunny Sunday mornings. When Fawkner built his hotel he had a larger room to devote to that purpose, and as he himself belonged to the Independent denomination, he gave them freely the use of it. But in a very short time they succeeded in erecting a temporary place of worship; a slight construction, for they had not as yet obtained any grant of land, and merely put up a make-shift framework in the bush for temporary purposes. Meantime the Roman Catholic Church also was showing signs of activity. The members of that denomination at an early date assembled themselves together for the public reading of prayers in such rooms as were most available. As a rule it was a store that was employed for the purpose; the bags of potatoes and the barrels of flour being hauled to one side, a clear space was left for the handful of faithful adherents who gathered to follow the observances of their faith. In one of these meetings, held on Sunday, the 28th of April 1839, they prepared a petition to Dr. Polding, in Sydney, requesting him to send them a duly ordained priest, in order to afford them \" those religious aids without which all human prosperity is vain and nugatory.\" In response to their appeal, there came in May the accomplished and scholarly Father Geogheghan, a priest of the strictest order and sworn to poverty. Before his arrival his little flock had gathered nearly a hundred pounds for the erection of a temporary structure. It was only a great shed, capable of keeping off the sun or the rain from about 400 people. They, too, had to place their temporary church on waste land, as there was as yet no provision made for church grants ; but Captain Lonsdale selected for them a block of two acres at the corner of Elizabeth and Lonsdale streets, promising to use his influence with Governor Gipps to secure it for them in permanency. To this site they readily enough carted their frail erection. Meantime Father Geogheghan had entered on a vigorous canvass to secure funds for a better structure. He threw himself into the movement with unbounded ardour, and withdrew for his own support none of the money that he gathered, preferring to sleep in the bar of a little inn, where the landlady, a daughter of his own church, nightly made him up a bed among the beer barrels.\" He induced a committee of twelve to canvass from house to house, and he published among the advertisements of the little newspapers of the settlement an appeal to those of other denominations to assist in the scheme he had so much at heart. On all hands the appeal was 8 Archer, Melbourne Review, Vol. VIII."], [601, "THE CHURCHES OF VICTORIA. 579 well received, and before the end of the year \u00a3300 were in hand for the commencement of the wished-for building, and the Catholics passed a resolution of grateful thanks to those esteemed individuals of other persuasions who had so generously aided them in erecting a place wherein to worship God after -the manner their consciences dictated. In the middle of 1839, two years after the formal proclamation of the township, there were in it five temporary places of worship. The English Church had theirs iri William-street ; the Presbyterians in Collins-street ; the Roman Catholics were considered to be \" out in the bush\" at the corner of Elizabeth and Lonsdale streets ; the Independents had a portable structure at the foot of the P^astern Hill ; and the Wesleyans had recently provided themselves with a very small place upon an allotment in Swanston-street ; it stood a little way back from the street, near the corner of Flinders-lane. That body had at first held its little meetings in the dwelling of a tailor f then at the residence of a carpenter. But a builder named Peers, at his own cost, erected on the site already described a brick room, capable of holding 150 persons. It was occupied at first by no regular pastor; in September 1839 there arrived in Melbourne the Rev. Mr. Tuckfield, who had been sent out by the Wesleyan Church in England to organise a mission to the aborigines.1 He conducted service for some time, till the site of his mission was chosen at Buntingdale. But the first regularly appointed pastor was Mr. Hurst, who, however, in a short time left the church in order to join Mr. Tuckfield in his mission of kindness to the blacks, and then the Wesleyans obtained their first permanent clergyman, the Rev. Mr. Schofield. In these days Government aid was freely given to the support of the churches, and Gipps placed the little congregations at Port Phillip on the list. Mr. Grylls, the Church of England clergyman, received \u00a3200 per annum; Mr. Forbes, the Presbyterian, received \u00a3150; and a like sum annually was given to Father Geogheghan and to Mr. Schofield. Contributions to the building funds of these four denominations brought the total of Government aid to the respectable sum of \u00a32150 per annum. The only one of the five sects then represented who were not on this list were the Independents. In 1839 they applied for assistance like the rest, but Governor Gipps replied that the sums already assigned to the churches and to education throughout the colony were far more than the Secretary for the Colonies approved of. There was no State church in Australia, but those denominations whose numbers made them of importance might receive such assistance as the public revenue could afford ; but it was manifestly impossible for him to provide half the cost of construction of all the churches that were asked for, and half the salary for clergymen of every little sect that refused to coalesce with other larger bodies of very much the same opinions as themselves. Xo assistance was given, but Gipps made them a grant of two acres in a very fine situation on the brow of the Eastern Hill, at the corner of Collins and Russell streets. Yet, thrown on their own resources, this denomination showed themselves to be, if not what the Patriot grandiosely calls them, \"a people few in number but great in intellect,\" yet the most energetic and self-reliant of all. In September 1839 they had built on their allotment a good house for their minister, Mr. Waterfield, at a cost of \u00a3300, and they were the first in the colony to erect a permanent church. At the corner where now stands their fine structure, they laid the foundation-stone of the first ecclesiastical ornament of the colony. It was on the 6th of September 1839 that Henry Hopkins, a prominent Independent of Hobart, performed that ceremony, and in little more than a year a neat-looking building of handsome front was ready for occupation. It was formally opened on Xew Year's Day 1841, when Waterfield, Forbes, and Orton preached in succession. It seated 600 persons, and 'its internal fittings made it the finest hall in the colony for several years subsequently, the central chandelier being especially a source of gratification ; and on a Sunday evening the wayfarer on the streets of Melbourne could not but notice the special brightness of those windows that crowned the hill of Collins-street. 3 Bonwick's \" Discovery and Settlement of Port Phillip\" p. 138. 4 See page 236."], [602, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 580 In the meantime the Church of England services were still being conducted in the woe-begone structure in William-street. But a vigorous effort was being made to raise funds for a really handsome building. A number of large subscriptions came in, and a design was procured for a church of what was then considered vast dimensions, to be provided with a steeple in the orthodox fashion. But then the contributions began to come in more slowly, and after the arrival of Latrobe it was resolved to build so much of it as the funds in hand would provide for. Accordingly, on the 9th of Xovember 1839, after a short service in the temporary building, a procession was formed, and Grylls led Latrobe to the site hard by where he was to lay the foundation of St. James' Church. But before the end of 1840 funds had been exhausted in spite of Government aid, and at the time when the Independents were opening their building, the Anglicans were still busy organising amateur concerts and entertainments in aid of their building fund. At the end of 1841 a visitor to Melbourne notices the magnitude of St. James' Church, and the general superiority of its design, but speaks of it as being still \" in progress of erection.\" However, it was by that time possible to conduct service in it, and its walls of dark brown stone had a look of gloomy solidity and indeed of antiquity, long before it was completed. It formed a notable landmark on that cottage-dotted hill rising from out the illimitable sorest that in those days stretched inland. It took a long time to build, being still referred to in 1844 by the local newspapers as a church that \"will be a magnificent structure when finished.\" But meantime the Church of England had built a second edifice and completed it. The suburb of Collingwood grew so steadily, and the town of Melbourne itself went so much more rapidly up the Eastern Hill than up the Western, that a second parish was formed, and St. Peter's Church was founded on nth Xovember 1841. Its first incumbent was the Rev. J. W. Wilson, who came over to Melbourne in 1840 to occupy the place of Mr. Grylls, whilst that gentleman was gone to England, on leave of absence, to bring out his wife and family. On his return Mr. Wilson formed a new congregation at St. Peter's, and Mr. Grylls resumed his charge at St. James', but he did not remain there long. He was scarcely of weighty enough calibre for the rapidly rising town of Melbourne, and his place was taken by the Rev. Adam C. Thompson, who continued to preach for many years. It was mainly through his zeal that St. James' Church was brought to a completion ; but he was a man with some peculiarities, which offended a portion of his flock, and the latter part of his ministry was marred by internal dissensions. Meantime the Presbyterians had added an architectural feature to the nascent city. The foundation-stone of their first permanent church was laid on the afternoon of Friday, 21st January 1841. It was a miserable day, and only a handful of people were there. The feeble clergyman, Mr. Forbes, wrapped in greatcoat, offered up a short prayer, while the rain descended in an angry torrent upon his head when bared in reverent fashion. But in spite of this awkward beginning, the building went onward rapidly, and at a cost of \u00a32385 a quiet little edifice, not lofty or imposing, but in very good taste, was completed ere the end of the year.5 Here Mr. Forbes laboured with a zeal and kindliness that won all hearts. But in 1846 the din of far-off brawls became heard in Melbourne. For in 1843 the Church of Scotland was violently rent in two great factions over the question of the right of the civil tribunal to offer interference in matters spiritual. A large part of the ministers of that church had abandoned their dwellings and their salaries rather than receive State payment that was to be accompanied by State interference. This great disruption, as it was called, took place in May 1843 but Mr. Forbes did not resign till Xovember 1846, and Dr. Lang sarcastically suggests that he waited till he was sure of another church. This, however, was untrue, for the fact was that Forbes was not in any way interfered with, and he might have gone on as he was doing as long as he liked; but he seems to have reproached himself with the life of peaceful comfort he was leading while so many of the brethren with whom he sympathised were suffering for the sake of conscience. When he resigned a number of his congregation left along 5 It is seen to the right in the illustration on p. 377."], [603, "THE CHURCHES OF VICTORIA. 581 with him to form a part of the Free Church of Scotland. They held their services in the Mechanics' Institute, but after a time built a church in Swanston-street, to which they gave the name of \" John Knox,\" in memory of the sturdy old reformer. Mr. Forbes' place at the Scots' Church was filled by the Rev. Irving Hetherington, who arrived in April 1847, then a man of eight-and-thirty years old, who had seen some hard work. The son of a Dumfriesshire farmer, he had 'struggled into the ministry, and came to Australia as a missionary for the rough life of the bush. After ten years of heavy riding over all the wilds of the Maitland district, he was glad of a rest with a good manse and an educated audience. Forbes did not long continue his work in the John Knox Church, for his old enemy bronchitis carried him off a year or two later, and he was succeeded by the Rev. Mr. Miller. In 1846 another branch of the disrupted Presbyterian Church was formed. These were the United Presbyterians, who built in Collins-street, opposite the Scots' Church, that edifice long known as St. Enoch's Church, where the worthy Mr. Ramsay officiated. Father Geogheghan's labours had reached fruition on 4th October 1841, when the foundation was laid of St. Francis' Church at the corner of Elizabeth and Latrobe streets. The Wesleyans had not long been satisfied with their little place in Swanston-street. They were deliberating about a suitable site, when they heard that that fine block at the corner of Collins and Queen streets, whereon the handsome pile of the Bank of Australasia now stands, had been bid for at auction in one of the first land sales by a gentleman who had paid \u00a3\\o deposit, but had never paid the balance. The block had therefore never been alienated, and, though the land had now risen vastly in value, yet as it was for church purposes the Wesleyans were allowed to have it on payment of \u00a320. There they raised a very presentable edifice, which was distinguished by the possession of the first organ of the colon)'. There Mr. Schofield officiated for a time, till, when his three years' term was finished, he was removed to Parramatta. Then came Mr. Sweetman, who also served three years, and was succeeded by Mr. Butters. In 1 84 1 the Baptists made a commencement, when the Rev. John Ham arrived and began a weekly service on Sunday mornings in the Mechanics' Institute ; but after a short time the denomination secured an allotment in Collins-street, on the slope of the hill, and adjacent to that on which the Scots' Church already stood. There the)' built a neat and comfortable little church. The Jews never asked for State contributions or State grants of land. They bought a portion of an allotment in Bourke-street, on the slope of Batman's Hill, and on it erected, in 1S45, a synagogue, which needed to be of no great size, as the community, all told, did not number a hundred. Mr. Moses Rintel, though not a professional clergyman, conducted the services on Saturday forenoon. Geelong was by no means slow in providing itself with places of worship. Dr. Thomson laid the foundation-stone of its first church \u2014 a Presbyterian one \u2014 on 22nd March 1841, subscriptions having been freely contributed by all the Protestant sects. The denomination had already obtained a minister from Scotland, and for nearly a year the Rev. Mr. Love had been ministering to his people in houses and under the trees. The Church of England had already begun to gather contributions, and at the close of 1841 commenced the erection of their place of worship, in which the Rev. Mr. Collins was soon after installed. About September of the same year the Catholics also made a commencement, when Father Ryan appeared and began a vigorous movement for the collection of funds, and a little wooden building with its symbolic cross above the gable, soon made its appearance, and was opened in December 1842. The Wesleyans of Geelong held only class meetings at first, till the Rev. Mr. Wilkinson joined them for a time in 1S41, but after a short time they obtained the services of the Rev. Mr. Dredge, one of the assistant protectors of the aborigines, who had resigned that position.\" Portland built its first church\u2014 a Presbyterian one\u2014 in May 1842, and the Presbyterians were also first in Belfast, where they opened a church in February 1844. The Episcopalians were first at Brighton, where a little wooden building was opened in September 1842. The Wesleyans were first at Williamstown, having opened a temporary chapel in October 1841. 6 Sec p. 240"], [604, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 582 And now the churches, having fairly started, continued to progress, till in 1850 the Church of England had seven buildings, the Presbyterians eight, the Roman Catholics five, the Wesleyans five, the Independents two, and the Jews one ; or a total of twenty-eight churches with accommodation for 10,300 persons. In the next ten years they had increased to a total of 874 churches, with accommodation for 149,380 persons. In ten years more they had become 2134 churches, accommodating 340,000 persons ; and in yet another ten years the churches were no less than 3307, and accommodation was provided for 419,000 persons. Surely a most unprecedented growth, and showing both vitality and vigour among the religious bodies ! The Church of England in the colony was full of hopeful excitement about Xew Year time in 1848, watching for the signals that were to announce the arrival of the clipper-ship The Stag, for on board her came the first bishop of Melbourne. She reached Hobson's Bay on Sunday, 23rd January, in that year. Governor Latrobe, the mayor, the incumbent (A. C. Thompson), and at least a hundred others went out in boats to welcome him ; and as the bishop left the ship the crew manned the yards and gave three farewell cheers, which were answered by a crowd on Liardet's beach. He was brought in a barge up the river, and lodged in the parsonage in Bourke-street. Amid a congregation that crowded St. James' he preached his first sermon on Friday, 28th January, and was duly installed. Charles Stuart Perry, our first bishop, was at this time about forty years of age \u2014 a man grave in manner, and dignified but kindly, and with that undefinable attraction which culture gives. For indeed he was a most accomplished scholar, and the first mathematician of pre-eminence who landed in Australia. He had been Senior Wrangler and Smith's prizeman at Cambridge, but in later years had devoted himself to religion as his vocation. In 1837 he had obtained the degree of Doctor of Divinity, and five years later had become the incumbent of St. Paul's at Cambridge, a position which he held until Earl Grey offered him the appointment of Bishop of Melbourne. He remained twenty- seven years in this city, labouring in unobtrusive fashion to benefit the colony and build up the church to which he belonged. He found three clergymen under his control when he came to Victoria, but when he left it there was a body of over 300 in connection with his diocese. In 1874, when he had reached his sixty seventh year, his health failed him. He took a trip to England, but finding himself in no way mending, he resigned his see in 1876. CHARLES STUART PERRY, FIRST BISHOP OF MELBOURNE. o Jiu- ref\u00b0n Dn Perry'S aPP\u00b0intment i\u00bb 1848 was that the independence of the Port Phillip district was then understood to be a thing resolved on. The same cause led His Holiness the Pope to raise Melbourne to the dignity of a bishopric, and the Rev. Dr. Goold -who was chosen for the position-was consecrated only six months later than Dr Perry He was an Irishman born in the good old town of Cork in 1812.

He set to work at once for the purpose of erecting a cathedral, and had the foresight to choose a portion for it well to the east, on the commanding summit of the Eastern Hill. There, in 1850, he laid the foundation of St. Patrick's Cathedral, a building which was to be of vast pro portions, but which there was no prospect of his ever seeing completed. And yet a good beginning was made, and in the golden years money flowed in freely enough, so that the walls of bluestone, faced with white, the gothic windows, and buttresses steadily rose in elegant proportions. In 1858 Bishop Goold was able to open the nave for divine service, but to-day, thirty years after that time, the spires and turrets are still only in process of elevation, though the church promises to be the most notable ecclesiastical adornment of the city. Dr. Goold was always busy introducing the various reli gious organisations which devote themselves to specific functions. The Christian Brothers and the Jesuits he brought to the colony for educational work ; the Sisters of Mercy, the Presentation Nuns, the Nuns of the Good Shepherd, and the Faithful Companions of Jesus, were established in Victoria by his exertions. In 1874 he was promoted to be an archbishop at the time when Ballarat and Sandhurst were constituted new sees, Dr. O'Connor being appointed to the one and Dr. Crane to the other. About 1 860 he changed his residence to the palace which his people built for him on the Eastern Hill, next to the cathedral, but as old age crept on he moved out of the noise and bustle of the city and chiefly lived at Brighton, where he quietly breathed his last on nth June 1886. The Church of England, in 1857, constituted a second see at Ballarat, to which Dr. Thornton was appointed. He arrived in that city on 5th August of that year, amid banners flying and bells ringing and a general excitement. It was in the following year that Bishop Perry resigned, and the see of Melbourne remained vacant for a year. Then Dr. Moor house was appointed \u2014 a man of great ability, of learning that was well abreast of modern times, and quite in consonance with scientific modes of thought; but above all, of an overflowing energy that carried out in a few weeks reforms and alterations over which others might have lingered as many years. He was not without the accusation of being masterful and overbearing, ST. PATRICK'S CATHEDRAL. 3 w Vol. I"], [606, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLLS. PAST AND PRESENT. 584 but the kind of work he had to do was sometimes all the better done if faced by a man who loved his own way and was resolved to have it. At the time of his arrival in Victoria he was over fifty years of age, and a large part of his laborious life had been spent in the duties of a parish clergyman, first as incumbent of St. John's, Fitzroy-square, in London, and afterwards as vicar of Paddington. Almost immediately after his arrival he began to stir his people up to the erection of a cathedral long talked of but never commenced. A great deal of agitation arose as to the site to be chosen ; some preferred the position of the first church, St. James'; others thought the situation of St. Peter's both higher and more central, but the successful party were those with whom Bishop Moorhouse sided. They desired to see the new cathedral raise its spires from out the busiest portion BISHOP MOORHOUSE. of the city, and on that account voted for the site of St. Paul's, a little church that had been built just before the era of the gold excitement, close to Prince's-bridge. It was not till 1880 that the foundation-stone was laid by the Governor, in the presence of over five thousand spectators. Since then its walls of light brown stone have slowly risen ; its gothic windows now stand sufficiently high to suggest a bold and original design, which eventually will carry its two side towers to a height of 153 feet, and its central spire to 275 feet above the din and bustle of the streets. After nine years of service in the colony, Dr. Moorhouse accepted the see of Manchester, and returned to England. He sailed from Port Phillip in March 1886, leaving behind him the memory of an eloquent preacher, who, by stirring lectures and vigorous deliverances upon current 1~ f-\\ t~**\u00bb i*r*.-c*l-\\'-*i^r-\\^,fc^-^*-**-fc^^^^*-h^._J_ 1*1 Lupins, ndu ueen a considerable factor in the intellectual life of the colony. His place was taken by Dr. Goe, who arrived on 12th April 1887. The Independent body in 1842 consisted solely of the church in Collins-street, over which Mr. Waterfield presided. After a year or two he resigned, and the temporary charge was taken by the Rev. F. Miller, who, however, officiated for only a few months. For the Rev. Alexander Morison, having crossed from Tasmania on a visit, and having preached so as to charm the hearts of the congregation, was invited to become the min- ister of the church. He accepted, and for twenty years laboured among the people of his own denomination, not only in Mel bourne, but out in the bush and away in other towns, for it was not till near the time of the gold"], [607, "THE CHURCHES OF VLCTORLA. 585 discoveries that the Independents were able to erect a second place of worship in the colony, and in 185 1 they had still only the two churches. In the year 1864 Mr. Morison had a quarrel with his people and withdrew from them, joining himself for a time to the Presbyterians, though he subsequently went back to his former denomination, and was eventually made Professor of Hebrew in the Congregational College, which was founded in 1879 to train students for the ministry of that church. But Mr. Morison's place in Collins-street had been filled by the advent from England of the Rev. Anketell Henderson, one of the most popular and capable preachers the colony has ever possessed. Stimulated by his exertions, the congregation resolved to build a church worthy of its chief place in a body now numbering over 20,000 persons. The foundation was laid in November 1866, upon the site of that old church founded by Mr. Hopkins in 1839, and, strange to say, the same gentleman, now indeed a veteran, again crossed from Tasmania to lay the foundation of this second structure, which soon arose, a bright design of ornamental brickwork, more sparkling in effect than is customary in church architecture.' Its interior is arranged somewhat after the fashion of a theatre, and there, week after week for years, the largest congregations that met in the colony listened with rapt attention to the utterances of the long-robed figure which occupied the simple platform. But excess of brain work caused the preacher to break down ; he went abroad to recover his health ; he was expected shortly to return, when the news arrived of his death in Canada. His place was filled by the eloquent, but slightly eccentric, Thomas Jones, who, after two years of successful work, returned to his native Wales, and the church was occupied by the Rev. D. J. Hamer. Four years were spent by this capable clergyman in the service of the congregation. He attracted large audiences, but made himself more notable by his philanthropic services, when he too had to take a rest for the sake of his health ; but in the midst of his holiday, while seeking the restorative waters of New Zealand, his slender thread of life was snapped, and the Independent Church in Collins-street was once more vacant. But the congregation, with that enterprise which had always characterised it, at once set about the task of introducing a man of talent sufficient to maintain the prestige of the church ; then came Dr. Bevan, whose large, burly form, whose round and joyous-looking face, still are seen on Sundays upon the plat form in a crowded church. Being a man whose theology is REV. ANKETELL M. HENDERSON. by no means isolated from the problems\u2014 social, scientific, and moral\u2014 that fill with interest the hearts of our times, he has been an acquisition to the thought of the colony, and has helped to stir the pulses of a busy intellectual circulation. From a purely religious point of view there can be no doubt that the Wesleyans have been from the very first, as they still are, the most active denomination of the colony. While other sects were building imposing edifices they were scattering little churches in every suburb, in every township, and even in remote and silent country districts. Thus, in 1860, they had 320 places of worship when no other denomination had 200 ; and they seated 46,000 worshippers when no other denomination could seat 30,000. In 1870 the next most active sect were the Presbyterians with 498 churches accommodating 65,000 persons; but the Wesleyans had their 631 churches, accommodating 115,000. One of their most notable preachers was the Rev. D. J. Draper, whose thirty years' services made him universally known and respected, and whose tragic end on board the London in 1866 roused the sympathy of all the colony. Their most prominent church has been that of central Melbourne. It stood for fifteen years upon the site in Collins-street which the Wesleyans had obtained in 1840. But in 1856 that land had grown so valuable ' It is seen in the foreground of the view on p. 539"], [608, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 586 that thev were able to sell it for the handsome sum of \u00a335,000, though it is now worth \u00a3200,000. With a part of the money thus obtained they bought a much smaller and far less valuable site in Lonsdale-street, and with the balance of \u00a326,000 they erected a noble structure, which they called the Wesley Church. Its graceful fretwork of carved and pinnacled stone, and its tall and tapering spire, were completed in less than a year, and it has now stood for thirty years as one of the most conspicuous ornaments of the city. The Presbyterians were next to the Wesleyans in activity, but they had the advantage of them in regard to the eminence of their preachers. For twenty years Irving Hetherington had officiated in the Scots' Church from .847 to 1867, with the reputation of being the most vigorous preacher of the colony. He was then approaching the age of sixty, and the congregation secured for him an assistant, bringing' out from Scotland for that purpose Peter Sinclair Menzies, who arrived in June 1868, and ere long took rank as the most cultured writer and the most original thinker whom the churches of Victoria possessed. A modest man, of quiet habits and literary tastes, he took little part in the bustle and stir of the community, and less still in its frequent polemics of theology ; but the charm of an easy style, of fresh and suggestive thoughts, and of a full but not laborious scholarship, not only gathered round his pulpit the ablest men of the Presbyterians, but also attracted as occasional hearers the more intellectual of all denominations. Dr. Cairns was another promi nent clergyman of this denomination. He arrived during the agitation of the golden era, and a church, named in honour of the famous Dr. Chalmers, was erected for him in East Mel bourne, out in the vacant lands behind the Treasury. There he laboured for twelve years till at the age of sixty-three he REV. P. S. MENZIES resigned his duties in 1865. In the latter part of his ministry he had the assistance of the Rev. Dr. Cameron, a man of first-rate ability, but the antithesis of Menzies, being as much at home in business and bustle and discussion, as the other was disinclined to mingle in them. From the year 1846 onward, the Presbyterians of Victoria imitated the contentious churches in Scotland, and were divided into first three and then four distinct denominations. In 1859 they agreed to re-unite. After much labour on the part of Hetherington and other peacemakers, the Synods of the four Presbyterian sects held a final meeting in the Scots' Church, when all four were amalgamated under the title of the Presbyterian Church of Victoria. Its first moderator was the Rev. James Clow, who had landed twenty-one years before, when Melbourne had indeed a few buildings to boast of, but when these were not many nor much to look at. The General Assembly of the united church continued to meet annually in the Scots' Church till 1869, but in that year St. Enoch's Church across the street had grown empty ; it was too near to be needed, and the talent in the Scots Church had withdrawn all its congregation. The disused edifice was converted by the church into its General Assembly Hall. Meantime the congregation at the Scots' Church had grown too large for its pioneer building, and it had too many wealthy men to be content with so humble a structure. It was resolved to build a fine new church. The foundation was laid by Hetherington in 1873. Dr. Cairns was present and so was P. S. Menzies, but during all their solemn services over the ceremony the wind raged and the rain descended in torrents just as they had done at the foundation of the former church. Whether from the effects of that inclement day, or from general ill-health, Menzies died before the beautiful church that had been mainly intended for him, had been prepared for use ; and when its handsome pulpit of pure white stone was completed it was the Rev. Mr. Stobbs, a capable preacher, but easy-going pastor, who spoke from over its exquisitely-carved lectern. This"], [609, "THE CHURCHES OF VICTORIA. 587 tastefully designed building of brown and white sandstone rises, with many a carved window and many a flying buttress, into a steeple whose graceful proportions terminate in a point 211 feet above the street level.\" But after Mr. Stobbs had officiated for a year, Mr. Hetherington resigned, and Mr. Stobbs and the congregation failed to agree as to the terms on which he should be promoted to the senior place. Accordingly a new minister was applied for, and in August 1875, the Rev. Charles Strong arrived. He immediately took rank as the most attractive preacher the colony had ever possessed ; not peculiarly eloquent, not remarkably powerful, but with an undefinable grace and sweetness of manner, of diction, and of thought that is, in these days at any rate, of more abiding value in a preacher than the glow of passion and the fervour of lofty sounding words. The whole service of this church, as conducted by him, was characterised by good taste and artistic feeling, his sermons in especial being, from a literary point of view, the most highly finished that the colony had ever heard. Unfortunately, he belonged to a school of thought which the older Presbyterians considered unsafe, too much infected with modern scientific notions ; too little bound by the strict letter of the scriptures. They had not been altogether pleased with Menzies, whose views had been scarcely orthodox. They had been less pleased with Stobbs, but they were pleased least of all with Strong. There was a time of watchfulness, and suspicion, and then he was called upon to state his views with regard to the fundamental doctrines of the church. The leading members of his congregation advised him to do nothing of the kind. They considered that the General Assembly which was to form accusers, jury, and judge, in the trial, was hopelessly prejudiced against him, he should therefore stand upon his legal right and demand that they should bring forward some specific charge and not assert a claim to overhaul his beliefs from end to end in the hopes of somewhere finding a vulnerable corner. The majority of the Assembly, however, maintained that a clergyman is bound, whenever called upon, to give an explicit and no uncertain sound as to all his doctrines. The fight lasted for some years and grew more and more bitter. But at length by a large majority the General Assembly pressed its points, and to avoid the indignity of an open dismissal Mr. Strong resigned his position in 1884. But his congregation was in sympathy with him, and indeed the struggle had latterly been one of the Scots' Church, with the assistance of two smaller congregations, against all the rest of the Presbyterian body. When Mr. Strong retired and returned to Scotland for a rest, the Scots' Church congregation endeavoured to detach themselves from the denomination. But their lands and all their properties were vested in the General Assembly, and if they simply abandoned the church, they would lose property to the value of nearly a hundred thousand pounds. They strove to obtain an Act of Parliament to enable them to keep their property, though they should sever from the main body ; but this was found to be impos- sible, and the great majority of the congregation resolved to break completely away, and leave to the Presbyterian Church of Victoria its triumph and its property. On the nth of November 1885, a meeting was held in the Temperance Hall to establish a new denomination to which the name of \"The Australian Church\" was subsequently given. For a year previously, an enthusi- astic congregation of over a thousand persons had listened every Sunday to Air. Strong's sermons which he delivered weekly in that hall after his return from Scotland. On the 19th of March 1887, the foundation was laid of the new structure, which on completion became a conspicuous feature in a most advantageous site in Flinders-street. Its lofty Corinthian pillars springing from the summit of a long flight of stone steps, now make a handsome addition to the ecclesiastical architecture of the city. Throughout all the early years of the colony, the State had contributed largely to the maintenance of the churches. In 1853, in order to check the tendency to excessive expense in this direction, the vote for religious purposes was limited to \u00a350,000 per annum. But the feeling 9 It is seen in the view on page 539."], [610, "VICTORIA AND ITS METROPOLIS: PAST AND PRESENT. 588 of the community was against any such payment, and a constant agitation was kept up for the abolition of all State-aid to religion. The laymen in most of the churches were in favour of its abolition, but the clergy as a rule spoke out against any such impious action; Dr. Cairns and Bishop Perry being two who made their views most decidedly known. In 1856, a meeting of two thousand people in the Theatre Royal, under Mr. Sargood as chairman, adopted almost unanimously a strong resolution against the system of State-aid ; but no political action was taken till 1862, when Heales made it one of his democratical reforms. He was turned out of office too soon to effect any practical result, and the measure was not brought before Parliament till 1865, when George Harker introduced a bill to abolish all State-aid to religion. It was rejected in the Assembly by four votes. But again in 1869 McCulloch introduced a bill to effect the same purpose in a milder way. He proposed to leave the churches all their lands in fee simple, so that they could sell them or do with them what they pleased. But the annual vote of \u00a350,000 was to be decreased by \u00a310,000 each year, so that it would be abolished altogether in 1874. MacBain, Higinbotham, Duffy, Wrixon, and many others spoke strongly against the existing system. Fellows was the only speaker who defended it. The bill was passed in the Assembly by a great majority. Then the Catholic, the Anglican, and a part of the other clergy began to work upon the Council, with sufficient effect to secure the rejection of the bill when it came before that body. T. T. a'Beckett was its most strenuous opponent, and he secured fourteen votes against eight. But in the very next year McCulloch again brought in his bill to the Assembly, and again it was passed, this time by fifty-four votes against seven. On this occasion when it appeared before the Council, a'Beckett rose in his place and said that he was still as strongly as ever in favour of State-aid to religion, but as the feeling of the people was running very violently against it, he would support the bill, and he adjured his fellow-members to follow his example, or else there was trouble in store for the colony. They accepted his counsel, and the bill was passed by eighteen to seven. From that time onward, the churches were thrown entirely on their own resources \u25a0 and since then have had to rely solely on voluntary contributions. But they have exhibited rather an increase than a diminution of vitality. Eighteen years have elapsed since then, and in that short time they have increased their places of worship from two thousand to four thousand they now possess charitable and other organisations vastly greater in proportion than those of 1870, and the religious life of the colony is in every way fuller and more vigorous. The remarkable growth of such institutions as the Young Men's Christian Association, sounded in 1 87 1, and the Young Women's Christian Association of a later date, indicates how' great the room is for religious activity of an undenominational character.
