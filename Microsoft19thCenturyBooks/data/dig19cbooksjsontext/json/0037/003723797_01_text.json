WASHINGTON: GOVERNMENT PRINTING OFFICE. 1877-"], [6, ""], [7, "Office U. S. Geological and Geographical Survey of the Territories, Washington, December 31, 1876. The present catalogue is intended to give an enumeration of all the publications of the United States Geological and Geographical Survey of the Territories issued to the present time. In order fur ther to convey an adequate idea of the work done, the captions of the several parts of each volume are also given under the general titles of the volumes. The titles are interrupted by vertical bars ( | ). to exhibit the adjustment of the typography on the respective title pages. The Geologist-in-charge is desirous of securing, by exchange, the publications of foreign countries on geology, pal\u00e6ontology, and natu ral history generally, to aid in the formation of a library of reference, for the use of the Survey of which he has charge. He avails himself of this opportunity again to ask those persons or societies that may receive the publications of the Survey to recip rocate, by sending to him such of their own publications as they may feel disposed;1 and he believes that he can assure them an ample return, either in books or specimens, or both. The reports of surveys, with maps, charts, and sections, transac tions of societies, or the publications of individuals engaged in sci entific studies, are much desired as works of reference. Individuals or societies who may look favorably upon the above proposition can send all packages, through the Smithsonian Institu tion, to the address of Dr. F. V. Hayden, U. S. Geologist, Washing ton, D. C. A careful record will be kept of the addresses of all the correspond ents of the Survey. Societies, libraries, or persons engaged in active scientific investigation desiring to receive the publications of the Sur vey will confer a favor by communicating their wishes. A few of the publications enumerated in this catalogue are either rare or entirely out of print. Some will doubtless- be reprinted. If societies or correspondents who desire to complete their series of the publications of the Survey will indicate to the Geologist-in-charge the missing volumes, they will be sent without delay. 3"], [8, ""], [9, "CONTENTS.
