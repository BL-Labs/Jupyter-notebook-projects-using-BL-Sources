The author writes that Barbizan is a small but independent State in Asia, almost unknown. Only one man, an Englishman, John Smith by name, has ever explored it aud returned to ii'n'e the world, at large, an imperfect idea of this strange little country. It has laws peculiarly its own, which have emanated entirely from the whimsical brains of the different Monarchs, who have reigned from time to time. It seems that its customs, names, and the mode of dress adopted, are an amalgamation of ideas gathered from jaeople of different nation* alities who have visited Barbizan and who have been forced to stay there. It having been allowed to remain independent is owing to a superstitious belief that it is a most unlucky tract of country to possess, and the Powers on either side of it have therefore left it alone as a Buffer State."], [8, ""], [9, "Characters.
