Their association with Hope, Friendship, and Memory, has been displayed by poets in the most brilliant colours. Philosophers annex them to every exercise of the faculties, to the presence of whatever is beautiful and graceful, and especially to social beneficence. Let us inquire by what system these pleasures are most successfully combined, and in what period of Ise they flourish. They are never distant when earnestly sought ; and the humblest at tempt to discover their source is an addition to their number."], [14, ""], [15, "THE PLEASURES OF HUMAN LIFE. CANTO FIRST.

Poetical licence, it is humbly hoped, will excuse the use of the preterit instead of the participle in one of these lines. Truth's seraph sister, ever fair and young. \u2014 P. 59- '\u2022 6. Besides the moral efficacy of religion, nature has annexed an inexpressible pleasure to the ideas it excites. Whoever has studied the fine mechanism of the human mind, is acquainted with the deep, strong, and exquisite sensation which a sublime object affords. The true sublime is present when we feel our selves surrounded by stupendous tokens of an unseen power, whose mysterious grandeur creates hope, gratitude, and admi ration. These powerful springs of pleasure are all combined by religion, and especially by the Christian's. Admiration has been called the daughter of Ignorance ; but she is the mother of delightful sensations, when produced by a being whose power, wisdom, and benevolence are supreme. Sanctorius and other philosophers have proved, from physi cal laws, that pleasure attends all the movements of the heart, except those in which fear or hatred predominates : therefore every benevolent act or emotion conveys an abstract pleasure to ourselves, besides its relative advantage to society. Where, then, is the system so nearly allied to happiness as that reli gion which excludes every malignant sensation, and requires only peace and love ?

Diana de Poictiers (natural daughter of Henry II.) reformed, by her patient tenderness, the rash cha racter of her husband, Francis de Montmorenci, and preserved him from the massacre of St Bartholomew's day, to which Ca tharine de Medicis had marked him for a victim. After his un fortunate death, she negociated peace between Henry III. and Henry the Great, then king of Navarre ; \" Madam,\" said the lat ter, \" if you will pledge your word that he is sincere, I require no stipulations ; your word is equal to a thousand bonds.\" She died in her eightieth year, in 1619- The estimable character of Queen Mary is best described in the words of King William III., her husband, who replied to Dr Tennison's condolence on her death \u2014 \" During seventeen years, I never perceived a fault in her. She possessed a worth which nobody knew so tho roughly as myself.\" When the blest Pilgrim, bold in bounteous toil. \u2014 P. 67. 1. 1 \u2022 The missionaries to India, here alluded to, were men of most exemplary piety and indefatigable zeal in the cause of Christianity. The first protestant mission in that country was founded in 1707, by Bartholomew Ziegenbaly, a man of great benevolence and erudition. He erected a Christian church among the Hindoos, and collected many congregations. He was honoured with a letter of approbation and encouragement from George I., and patronized by the Society for Promo ting Christian Knowledge. He translated the Bible into the Tamul tongue, in which he was employed fourteen years. N"], [112, "98 After Ziegenbaly had finished his arduous course, he was fol lowed by other learned and zealous men, upwards of fifty in number, in the period of one hundred years ; among whom were Schultze, Janicke, Gericke, Swarlz, and Kohloff, per sons of eminent utility, whose minds seemed to be elevated by' their divine employment above the obstacles they encountered. The venerable Swartz holds a distinguished rank in this class : he was engaged with great success in his pious task near half a century. No dangers appalled, no difficulties discouraged him. His firmness was united with great humility, gentleness, and judgment. This devoted Christian, when dying, be queathed all his considerable property for the promotion of Christianity. \" Let the cause of Christ (said he) be my heir.\" He died in peace, highly honoured, and much lamented, by persons of all ranks in India, where his character and labours still shed a benign influence on the cause which he spent his life in propagating. And ye? meek heralds of the purer light. \u2014 P. 69. 1. 5. The lives of men devoted to the service of religion have been, with few exceptions, distinguished by their placid tenor, and by a surpassing share ofthe pleasures of human life; those real and permanent pleasures which spring from beneficence, content, and the esteem of pious men. Christianity's most eminent advocates, especially Grotius, Hooker, Burnet, Dodd ridge, and Watts, gave, in their deaths, the strongest proof of the tranquillity and hope derived from the precepts they taught. The fathers of philosophy, Bacon, Locke, and New-"], [113, "99 ton, may be added to the list of those who considered religion the basis of all human pleasures in life ; and the last moments of Bishops Lowth and Porteus are still recent examples of the felicity it lends in death. The sage who bade the orient world rejoice. \u2014 P. 69. 1. 13. Sir William Jones, the luminary of Asiatic literature and ju risprudence, will never be remembered in the East without tri umph. In his researches through the depths of Hindoo my thology, he discovered a remarkable coincidence between the wild, but sublime, legend of Brahma, Veeshnu, and Seeva, and the doctrines of Christianity. Veeshnu, the second per sonage of this mysterious trinity, possesses all the traits of our Saviour, and may be called the Christ of the Hindoos. Sir William attributed this striking affinity to a confused tradition of the Messiah, which may have reached Hindostan in earlier ages, and he rendered it a powerful auxiliary to the Christian cause. The vigour and variety of his talents, the depth of his disquisitions, and his ardent zeal in that cause, placed him among its most memorable champions. Yon mould'ring record had not vainly told Where Wisdom sleeps, and Eloquence lies cold ! \u2014 P. 86. 1. 7.
